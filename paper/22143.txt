Crash Beliefs From Investor Surveys

NBER Working Paper No. 22143
April 2016, Revised December 2017
JEL No. E03,G00,G02,G11,G23
ABSTRACT
Historical data suggest that the base rate for a severe, single-day stock market crash is relatively
low. Surveys of individual and institutional investors, conducted regularly over a 26-year period
in the United States, show that they assess the probability to be much higher. We examine factors
influencing investor responses and test the role of media influence, finding evidence consistent
with an availability bias. Adverse market events made salient by financial press are associated
with higher subjective crash probabilities. Exogenous shocks related to earthquakes are also
associated with higher probabilities. Finally, subjective crash probabilities are negatively
associated with mutual fund flows.

1. Introduction
Disaster risk and concerns about severe stock market crashes are the subject of considerable
recent research. Rare disaster concerns are relevant to the equity premium puzzle, 1 time-varying
market premiums,2 cross-sectional differences in asset returns,3 the volatility smile,4 and investor
choice.5 Despite their potential importance, rare disaster concerns are difficult to empirically
quantify.

Probabilities about extreme events are usually inferred from asset prices, and

disentangling probabilities from risk preferences presents problems. 6
In this paper, we turn to a different source of information about rare crash probabilities.
Since 1989, Robert Shiller has been surveying individual and institutional investor attitudes. One
question in the survey asks respondents to estimate the probability that a severe crash will occur
over the next six months. The definition of a crash is specific: a drop in the U.S. stock market on
the scale of October 19th, 1987 [-22.61%] or October 28th 1929 [-12.82%].7 This definition is
particularly relevant to the jump tail risk literature. Bollerslev and Todorov (2011) and Bollerslev,
Todorov and Xu (2015) argue that a significant component of priced tail risk is attributable to
investor fears about a near-instantaneous crash similar to the one-day drops of 1929 and 1987. A
key question in this work and related literature is whether asset prices reflect probabilities or
preferences. As Ross (2015) puts it, “State prices are the product of risk aversion—the pricing
kernel—and the natural probability distribution.”

We use the Shiller survey data to examine the magnitude of crash probabilities reported by
individual and institutional investors. We find evidence that the average, subjective probability of
an extreme, one-day crash on the scale of 1987 or 1929 [i.e., greater than 12.82%] to be an order
of magnitude larger than would be implied by the historical frequency of such events in the U.S.
market. Over the 1989-2015 period, the mean and median probability assessments of a one-day
crash were 19% and 10%, respectively. To the extent that this rare crash risk fear is priced, our
analysis suggests that it may function through extreme probability assessments rather than through
risk aversion.
We find that crash probabilities vary significantly through time and are correlated to
measures of jump risk such as the VIX and the occurrence of extreme negative returns. We also
test behavioral hypotheses about whether investor priors are subject to the influence of the media.
In particular, we test for the incremental effects of media sentiment measured from articles
about the market on the days prior to the survey. Positive and negative sentiment are measured
for each article using sentiment analysis, and the information is aggregated across articles to
capture media sentiment on a particular day. We find evidence that the financial press mediates
investor crash beliefs, and does so asymmetrically. Articles with negative sentiment are associated
with higher crash probability assessments following market downturns, but articles with positive
sentiment have no effect. We explore the question of whether this association operates through
the availability heuristic, and extent to which affect plays a role. We find evidence consistent with
an availability bias when examining the crash probabilities of investors who recently experienced
exogenous rare events. Specifically, we study a case where the direction of causality can be clearly
stated, moderate earthquakes in the respondents’ locality, and where the rational national market
response practically cannot be significant.
2

The availability heuristic (cf. Tversky and Kahneman (1973) & Kahneman and Tversky
(1982)) is the tendency to use easily recalled events to estimate the probability of an event
occurring. Subjects prone to the availability heuristic “bias” their probability beliefs by giving
more weight to “top-of-mind” data. Tversky and Kahneman (1973) tests show that it is possible
to induce this bias through priming or framing. Studies of the availability heuristic have mostly
focused on stock price reactions to information. Akhtar et. al. (2013) document an asymmetric
response of stock prices to the release of consumer sentiment news. They report evidence
consistent with the availability heuristic – inferring shifts in probability assessment from asset
price changes. Kliger and Kudryavtsev (2010) likewise rely on the asymmetry implied by
negativity bias to test the availability heuristic. They find that stock price reactions to analyst
upgrades are weaker on days of large market moves. Taking a different tack, Nofsinger and Varma
(2013) use investor decisions to test for the availability bias. They argue that the investor tendency
to repurchase a stock previously held is evidence of reliance on the availability heuristic. The
contribution of our study to research on the availability heuristic in finance is that we directly test
its relationship to probability estimates; the setting in which the hypothesis was originally
formulated by Tversky and Kahneman (1973).
The availability heuristic is particularly pertinent to investment decision-making because
probability assessment of events – for example, the likelihood of tail risk events – affects investor
allocations to risky assets.8 If investors give too much weight to recent market events – perhaps
because they look at recent investment outcomes – this may cause them to incorrectly estimate the
probability of a crash. By the same token, the media may frame recent events through selective

8

Cf. Barberis (2013).

reporting – emphasizing negative outcomes and thus making them more available when a subject
is asked to assess the probabilities of a related event.
We find evidence that investors use recent market performance to estimate probabilities
about a crash. We also find that the press makes negative market returns relatively more salient
and this is associated with individual investor probability assessments of a crash. This latter
mechanism is consistent with Barber and Odean (2008), Engelberg and Parsons (2011), Kräussl
and Mirgorodskaya (2014), Yuan (2015) and other research documenting evidence that the news
plays an important role in focusing investor attention and influencing behavior. Moreover, we
provide supportive evidence that investor crash beliefs have meaningful consequences on
aggregate portfolio allocations. The survey-based crash probabilities are negatively associated
with future flows to equity-based mutual funds. We use plausibly exogenous variation in the crash
probabilities based upon differences between individual and institutional investors that are unlikely
to be driven by fundamental factors.
Johnson and Tversky (1983) observe that “judgments about risk… seldom occur in an
emotionally neutral context.” They find that emotion induced by brief reports about negative
events have a major effect on probability assessments. This has come to be termed the affect
heuristic (Slovic et. al. (2007)). Paul Slovic and co-authors, as well as other researchers (cf. Keller
et. al. (2006)) have explored how emotions – particularly fear and dread – influence probabilities
assessment. It is interesting from a finance perspective that their research identifies an inverse
relationship between expectations of risk and reward – the opposite implied by standard financial
models. The affect heuristic is similar to the “risk-as-feelings” model proposed by Lowenstein et.
al. (2001), who propose that risk is perceived experientially and is therefore subject to the broad

4

variety of factors known to influence emotions, including vividness of outcomes, personal
experience and mood. The affect and availability models are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
The balance of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data used in the
analysis. Section 3 presents the empirical findings and a number of robustness tests. Section 4
concludes.

2. Data
2.1. Survey Data
Robert Shiller’s Stock Market Confidence Indices are based on survey data collected
continuously since 1989; semi-annually for a decade and then monthly by the International Center
for Finance at the Yale School of Management since July, 2001. Shiller (2000a) describes the
indexes constructed from these surveys and compares them to other sentiment indicators and
studies their dynamics in the aggregate. In this paper we use the disaggregated survey responses
that are used to construct the indexes. About 300 questionnaires each month are mailed to
individuals identified by a market survey firm as high-net-worth investors and institutional
investors. They may fill it in when they wish, but they are asked to mark the date on which they
complete the survey. It is not a longitudinal survey – each month comprises a different sample of
respondents with the sampling goal of 20 to 50 responses by each of the two types – individual
and institutional. There is existing research that uses data from the Shiller surveys. Greenwood
and Shleifer (2015) find that the Shiller monthly investor confidence index is well-correlated to
several other investor surveys and to mutual fund flows. Barone-Adesi et. al. (2015) estimate
behavioral pricing kernels from market data and find them to correlate well to investor sentiment
5

surveys, including indexes constructed from the Shiller survey data used in this paper. Goetzmann
et. al. (2014) use the institutional investor responses from a telephone version of the survey about
beliefs in market mispricing in order to study variation in investor mood. Their results are
consistent with evidence derived from a different dataset of investor trading behavior.
In the current study, we use responses to the survey question:
“What do you think is the probability of a catastrophic stock market crash in the U. S., like
that of October 28, 1929 or October 19, 1987, in the next six months, including the case
that a crash occurred in the other countries and spreads to the U.S.? (An answer of 0%
means that it cannot happen, an answer of 100% means it is sure to happen.)
Probability in U. S.: _______________%”
The phrasing of this question has not been significantly altered during the sample period
we examine.9 Thus it has the advantage of consistency throughout a period of 26 years, during
which time the stock market, the macro-economy and the financial system has experienced
considerable variation. In addition to the responses to the questions, survey participants provided
the date on which the questionnaire was completed. Information about the ZIP codes of the
respondents is readily available from 2007. The combined sample contains 9,953 responses.
One issue to consider is that the phrasing of the question may make a crash salient and lead
to a heightened probability assessment. The term “catastrophic” and the highlighting of the two
crash dates may themselves trigger a response biased towards higher probability. The high-

9

This wording has remained the same since 1994. Prior to 1994, the question is phrased as: “What do you think is the
probability of a catastrophic stock market crash, like that of October 28, 1929 or October 19, 1987, in the next six
months?” Only approximately 10% of the observations used in the analysis are associated with the earlier wording.
The results are not sensitive to the exclusion of these observations.

6

sentiment term “catastrophic” could make investors more pessimistic. By the same token,
highlighting two crashes out of a century or more of data could trigger an availability heuristic.
There are several other questions in the surveys – some with positive and some with negative
sentiment; all about the stock market. These may also prime an investor response. These stimuli
make it potentially difficult to identify the marginal influence of news articles on probability
assessments. Another feature of the question is that it relies partially on a narrative about an event
occurring in other countries and spreading to the U.S. Experimental evidence suggests that people
rely on numerical and narrative evidence in assessing probabilities, and the relative degree of
reliance may depend on numeracy (Dieckmann et. al. 2009).
Given the affective and narrative features of the question, prior research suggests that we
should find cross-sectional differences among respondents based on their numerical sophistication
and perhaps other factors. If the high base-line probability assessments are due solely to framing
factors within the questionnaire, this would suggest that direct priming may be a source of extreme
bias about the probabilities – an interesting fact in itself. Later in the paper, we return to the issue
of whether responses may be attributable to affect, availability or an interaction of both tendencies.
Figure 1 graphs the average annual probabilities for the individual and institutional
respondents. It also shows a set of additional variables: the annualized volatility of the daily DJIA,
the largest negative return in each year (represented as a positive number on the figure) and the
VIX implied volatility. The individual and institutional means are relatively similar. Crash
probabilities were higher in the period 1997-2003 and 2007-2011. These periods also correspond
to higher realized volatility, implied volatility and most extreme one-day DJIA percentage
declines. These trends suggest that the probability assessments change with factors associated
with extreme market declines. Not shown in the figure are probabilities inferred from historical
7

market performance. It is well known that a log-normal model is not appropriate to estimate the
probability of an extreme decline. The average daily standard deviation of the DJIA is about 1%
and the two crashes of interest are 12 times and 20 times the daily standard deviation. This has
motivated the use of mixed jump processes to describe stock market moves. 10
A simple approach to estimating a baseline probability is to use the historical frequency of
such events. Under the assumption of an i.i.d. distribution of daily returns, and using the number
of trading days since October 23, 1929 through December 31, 1988 [taking the most conservative
bounds] gives an average probability of an extreme crash over a six-month horizon of 1.7%. This
decline to approximately 1% when the entire history of the DJIA is used. The average reported
crash probability from the Shiller surveys is thus more than 10 times the conservative estimate.

2.2. Market Data
For stock market data, we use daily data on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P
500 and a value-weighted index of the NYSE-AMEX-Nasdaq-Arca universe. The daily returns
of each index are used to empirically measure market volatility and the occurrence of extreme
events. We also use the returns to the indices on and before the day that the questionnaires are
completed as a control for market trends that jointly influence media articles and investor
heuristics. Market volatility implied by the VIX is obtained from Federal Reserve Economic Data
(FRED).

Cf. Gabaix (2008), Wachter (2013), Bollerslev and Todorov (2011).

2.3. Media Data
We use ProQuest to search the Eastern Edition of the Wall Street Journal [WSJ] for the
period of the questionnaire sample: 1989-2015. This is the only edition available on ProQuest for
that period. We presume that it corresponds reasonably well to the national edition. Data were
collected in the weeks of May 17 through June 11 of 2016. We searched articles containing words
and phrases associated with the stock market, yielding a total of 133,496 articles with a word count
of at least 250 words.11
Garcia (2014) documents a significant asymmetry in media reportage of past market
returns – negative outcomes are reported more frequently in certain Wall Street Journal columns. 12
This is consistent with evidence that both animals and humans are conditioned to give stronger
weight to negative things, experiences and events (cf. Baumeister et. al., 2001 and Rozin and
Royzman, 2001). Negative experiences engage greater cognitive effort (Ito et. al., 1998), have
greater influence in evaluations (Ito et. al., 1998), are more likely to be taken as valid (Hilbig,
2009) increase arousal, and enhance the memory and comprehension of the event (Grabe and
Kammhawi, 2006). These prior results lead us to expect that the availability bias – if it exists –
should be asymmetric. Negative events should have a greater effect on probability assessments
than positive events.

11

The Proquest search term used to identify the articles is: “(stock NEAR/5 market) OR SU(stock) OR SU(securities)”.
We did not use broader search terms, such “SU(markets)”, because they yielded articles on other asset markets, such
as for bonds and commodities.
12
Garcia (2014) focuses on financial market columns from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal from
1905 to 2007. These columns may not necessarily appear on the front page, where articles are more likely to be viewed
by readers. For example, the “Abreast of the Market” column in the Wall Street Journal, which is used in Garcia
(2014), appears on the front page of a section 40.8% of the time over our sample period.

9

For each article, sentiment is defined as a function of the number of positive and negative
words.13 Media sentiment is measured by aggregating the sentiment of articles for each date. We
classify words using the General Inquirer (GI) – a lexicon of positive and negative words that is
widely used in text sentiment analysis. A number of prior studies use the GI to construct media
sentiment measures for newspaper articles. 14

Other approaches include constructing lexica

tailored to specific types of source documents. For example, Loughran and McDonald (2011)
manually code common terms found in SEC regulatory filings into valence classes, as some terms
may have different connotations in financial documents compared to other documents. Our main
results are not sensitive to the choice of the word list.15
We follow Loughran and McDonald (2011) in weighting word frequencies using the “tf–
idf (term frequency-inverse document frequency)” method which accounts for a word’s relative
prevalence within and across documents. Using un-weighted word counts does not control for the
fact that some words are simply more common than others (cf. Manning, Raghavan, and Schutze
(2008)).16 Our use of the tf-idf weighting scheme is motivated by Loughran and McDonald’s

13

The General Inquirer assigns approximately 10,000 words to 26 major and 182 minor categories, or tags. It
aggregates categories from the Harvard IV-4 dictionary, Lasswell value dictionary, a social cognition dictionary from
Semin and Fiedler (1988). The two largest categories are the positive and negative valence classes: the positive list
includes 1,915 words, while the negative list includes 2,291 words.
14
These studies include Tetlock (2007), Engelberg (2010), and Garcia (2013). There are a large number of studies
that apply sentiment analysis to firm regulatory disclosures. Loughran and McDonald (2016) provides an overview
of this literature.
15
In assessing the robustness of the choice of word lists, we focused on alternatives that are derived from different
types of document sources. Loughran and McDonald (2011) manually codes words that appear in SEC regulatory
filings for positive (354 words) and negative (2,355 words) categories, as well as others. Hu and Liu (2004) automates
term coding for valence categories (2,006 positive and 4,783 negative words) using a large collection of customer
reviews. An earlier version of this paper used article counts containing a few specific words such as “crash” and
“boom.” These results and the full list of search terms are available in the prior working paper of the same name.
16
Specifically, the weighted word frequency for word w appearing in article a is calculated as the product of the log( , )
scaled word frequency and the log-inverse document frequency:
ln( ), where 𝑛 , is the frequency for
(

)

word w in article a, 𝑛 is the average frequency for all words appearing in article a, A is the total number of articles
used in the analysis, and 𝑑𝑓 is the number of articles containing word w. Words that do not appear in the article
(𝑛 , = 0) are assigned a value of zero. See Loughran and McDonald (2016) for a complete discussion and survey of
methods using word frequency in textual analysis to measure sentiment.

10

(2011) finding “…that this approach [tf-idf] produces regressions with better fit than the
approaches using simple proportions.”
The first set of media sentiment measures relates to daily counts of articles coded as
negative or positive. For each article, we calculate a score based upon the difference between
weighted positive and negative word frequencies. To mitigate the influence of articles with larger
word counts, the difference is scaled by the sum of the weighted positive and negative word
counts.17 Articles are coded as negative and positive based upon whether their score is in the
bottom and top 10th percentile over all the articles used in the analysis, respectively. Finally, we
count the number of articles that are coded as negative (Negative) and positive (Positive) for each
date.
The second set is based upon a score that aggregates information across articles for each
date. Articles counts may be useful for distinguishing between the effect on positive versus
negative counts. However, the Positive and Negative measures are based upon the extreme articlelevel scores, and may not account for information from articles with non-extreme values. We
define Sentiment as the difference between the weighted positive and negative frequencies across
all articles for each date, scaled by the sum of the weighted positive and negative word frequencies
across all articles for each date.18 For the main analysis, we consider both sets of measures, though
we focus mainly on the Sentiment measure.

17

Normalization to adjust for document size is common in sentiment analysis. The term weighting scheme we use
mitigates document size effects to some extent, though it may be inadequate for some cases. We use the sum of the
weighted positive and negative word frequencies to simplify comparisons between positive and negative sentiment,
ignoring neutral sentiment. However, the results are not sensitive to normalizing based upon total word counts, which
includes neutral sentiment terms.
18
We also consider a number of other specifications: the weighted negative word count divided by the total weighted
word count; the difference between the positive and negative word count divided by the total weighted word count;
and the difference between the natural log of one plus the weight positive word count and the natural log of one plus
the weighted negative word count. The results are not sensitive to these alternative specifications.

11

Figure 2 graphs the average daily Sentiment and the average daily number of articles related
to the stock market for each year in the sample period. The sentiment scores reach their peak during
the dot-com boom and just before the financial crisis, while the average daily number of articles
peaks during the dot-com boom and during the financial crisis. The correlation between Sentiment
and article counts is close to zero over the entire sample period. Nonetheless, we control for total
article counts in all the regression models.

3. Empirical Results
3.1. Summary Statistics
Table 1 displays the variable descriptions and summary statistics. The interquartile range
of the stock indices are comparable, through the overall range for the CRSP-VW and S&P 500
indices are slightly larger than that of the DJIA index. The mean and median of the subjective
probabilities are reported. They are 10% and 18.5%, respectively, indicating a positive skew.

3.2. Media Responses to Market Events
We begin by examining asymmetry in the effects on media sentiment of positive and
negative market events. As a preview of the results, we show that negative returns in the prior day
are associated with significantly higher negative article counts, and positive returns are associated
with significantly higher positive article counts, although the positive article count results are
smaller in absolute magnitude. We find consistent results when examining the Sentiment directly.
12

There are significant coefficients on volatility, extreme returns, prior month returns, and past
media sentiment.
We estimate the following econometric specification:
𝑉 = 𝛼 +𝛼 𝑟

+𝛼 𝑟

+𝛼 𝑟

+𝛼 𝜎

,

+ 𝛼 𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡

,

+
(1)

𝛼 ln(1 + #𝐴𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑙𝑒𝑠) + 𝐹𝐸(𝐷𝑎𝑦 𝑜𝑓 𝑊𝑒𝑒𝑘, 𝑀𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ) + 𝜀

where Vt represent the media sentiment measures. The analysis examines the two sets of measures:
article counts based upon sentiment and sentiment scores.
We focus on the effects of the market return on the prior day (𝑟

). Regular trading hours

on major exchanges end at 4 PM Eastern Standard Time, so that news about market events on date
t-1 is likely to appear in print on date t. The return variables are specified so that the calculation
periods are not overlapping. We control for other market or fundamental factors related to market
returns on date t-1 that may also influence media sentiment. Specifically, we control for the market
return on two days prior (𝑟

), the market return over the period t-30 to t-3 (𝑟

volatility estimated over the period t-30 to t-3 (𝜎
the period t-30 to t-1 (𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡

), the daily

), the average daily media sentiment over

). and the natural log of the total number of articles that

are related to the stock market on date t (ln(1 + #𝐴𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑙𝑒𝑠) ). In all models, we include day-ofthe-week and month fixed effects. Robust standard errors that account for heteroskedasticity and
autocorrelation in the residuals with optimal lag length (Newey and West (1994)) are used to
calculate the test statistics.
In alternative specifications, we replace 𝑟

in equation (1) with 𝐷(

%) ,

a

dummy variable for whether the prior day return is in the bottom sample decile, and
13

𝐷(

( (

))

%) ,

a dummy variable for whether the prior day return is in the top sample decile.

By construction, the sample frequency of negative and positive market events is the same. This
allows us to directly assess asymmetry in the effect of negative and positive market events on
media sentiment. To alleviate data-mining concerns, we estimate the regression separately where
the market returns are proxied by the value-weighted index of NYSE/AMEX/Nasdaq/Arca (CRSPVW), the Standard and Poor’s 500 (S&P 500) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).
To start, we focus on the positive and negative article counts. 19 Table 2 displays the results.
Columns (1), (3) and (5) report results for Negative, while Columns (2), (4) and (6) report results
for Positive. The model fit across all the specifications range from 44.0% to 44.9%, suggesting
that the media have an independent influence on the market, beyond just mechanically reporting
past returns. Across the different return variable specifications, the previous day return is
negatively associated with negative article counts and positively associated with positive article
counts. This is consistent with the news reporting the direction of the prior-day market return.
The estimates are considerably generally larger in absolute magnitude for the negative than
positive article counts, consistent with asymmetry in the association. The regressions also indicate
an association between returns two days prior and prior month returns, though only for negative
article counts. Prior month volatility has a positive association and prior month Sentiment has a
negative association with negative article counts, and these relationships are opposite to those for
positive article counts. The coefficients on these variables are all consistent with the media
responding to market trends and with the sentiment scores calculated on the newspaper articles
19

The range of Positive and Negative are non-negative, potentially raising concerns on the consistency of the OLS
regression model estimates. To address this issue, the tests are re-estimated using tobit models that account for the
range of the dependent variable. Table A.1 displays the results. The model estimates are slightly larger in magnitude
compared to those in Table 2. The results provide evidence that the findings are not sensitive to the model
specification.

14

used in the analysis as meaningful measures of media sentiment. The results are not specific to
the use of any particular market return measure.
We next turn our attention to tests that use Sentiment as the dependent variable.20 Table 3
presents the results in Columns (1), (3) and (5).21 The results are consistent with those in Table 2.
Previous day returns are negatively associated with Sentiment. Columns (2), (4) and (6) present
similar results using dummies based upon whether the previous day return is in the top or bottom
sample decile. We include this specification to directly assess asymmetry in effects of negative
and positive prior day returns on media sentiment. It also addresses the possibility that only
unusual market moves are deemed newsworthy. Moreover, this specification mitigates the effect
of outliers driving the return-based results – i.e., a few extreme market moves accounting for the
significance of the coefficients.

The low return dummy is significant and its estimate is

considerably larger than that of the high return dummy. The marginal effects of the low return
dummy on Sentiment account for 36.5% to 39.4% of the overall sample variation for Sentiment,
which is economically meaningful. 22 In contrast, the marginal effects of the high return dummy
account for 4.2% to 7.0% of the overall sample variation for Sentiment. The differences in the
coefficients are also significant across the specifications, consistent with asymmetry in the return
association with media sentiment. Similar results obtain when also controlling for expected returns
volatility (see Table A.2).

20

It is possible that the Sentiment measure may incorporate reader responses, such as reader letters to the editor, to
prior day stock performance. However, analogous measure that only incorporate front page articles, which is unlikely
to feature reader content, or lead paragraphs yield similar results.
21
The range of Sentiment is between -1 and 1, potentially raising concerns on the consistency of the OLS regression
model estimates. To address this issue, the tests are re-estimated using tobit models that account for the range of the
dependent variable. Table A.1 displays the results. The model estimates are virtually identical to those in Table 3.
The results provide evidence that the findings are not sensitive to the model specification.
22
For example, the low return dummy coefficient in Model (6) of Table 3 (-0.028) divided by the sample standard
deviation for Sentiment from Table 1 (0.071) is -0.394 (=-0.028 / 0.071).

15

Next, we examine the persistence of the relationship between media responses and market
returns. Table 4 displays the results. For each set of return variables, future Sentiment is projected
onto the return variable, while using the same control variables in Table 3, for up to ten lags. We
only present the results for the extreme return dummies in order to focus on the effects of negative
and positive shocks. Consistent results (untabulated) obtain when using total market return instead
of a dummy. The association between low returns and media sentiment appears to persist for at
least ten days subsequently, while the association of high returns with media sentiment subsides
within one day. However, when compared to the results of Table 3, the effects are relatively
pronounced for the date immediately following the market event.
We are also able to identify the lead paragraph of each article and whether the article
appears on the front page or elsewhere in the newspaper. This allows us to further test whether
negative events are accorded greater prominence by the media. By controlling for sentiment of
content from non-lead paragraphs or articles that do not appear on the front page, these tests also
better account for the effects of fundamental factors than those in Table 3. We assume that
fundamental factors are likely to influence sentiment within each article or across articles on the
same date similarly. To that end, we reconstruct Sentiment based upon whether (i) the text appears
in the lead paragraph (SentimentLead) or (ii) whether the article appears on the front page
(SentimentFront). In the SentimentLead models, we also include the sentiment scores based upon text
from non-lead articles to assess whether the return variables have any remaining explanatory
power. Similarly, in the SentimentFront models, we also include the sentiment scores based upon
articles that are not on the front page. Significance in the return variables would suggest that the
market return has an effect on editorial decisions about sections of the newspaper that are likely to
be more widely viewed.
16

Table 5 reports the results. Controlling for the sentiment of non-lead paragraphs, prior day
returns have a strong negative association with the sentiment of lead paragraphs. As before, the
effects are considerably larger for negative versus positive return days, and the difference in the
absolute magnitudes are statistically significant. This difference may be due to a negativity bias
by the media, or it may reflect a recognition that negative news is more engaging to readers, and/or
relevant to investors – and thus will sell more papers. Importantly, these incentives may have an
effect on investor beliefs beyond what would be implied by fundamentals. Similar results obtain
for articles placed on the front page, controlling for the sentiment of articles not placed on the front
page. We argue that the newspaper’s readership pays closer attention to lead paragraphs and front
page articles. We test whether these associations affect the survey responses to questions about
crash beliefs in the next section.
A related question is prior day returns determine whether articles on the stock market are
more likely to have negative sentiment and appear on the front page. To address this question, we
perform tests on the article-level. We estimate probit regression models where the dependent
variable is a dummy associated with whether the article is coded as negative and appears on the
front page. The key explanatory variable is the prior day return, and the control variables are
identical to those in Table 5. Table A.3 displays the results. Column (1) shows that the coefficient
for prior day returns is negative and statistically significant at the 1% level. When restricting the
sample to only front page articles, we find similar results (Column (2)). The results suggest that
articles with negative sentiment are more likely to appear on the front page following negative
return days.
Finally, we examine whether articles with negative sentiment are more likely to appear on
the front page over articles with positive sentiment. We estimate probit regression models where
17

the dependent variable is a dummy associated with whether the article appears on the front page.
The key explanatory variables are dummies based upon whether the article is coded as negative or
positive, and the control variables are identical to those in Table 5. Table A.4 displays the results.
The results show that negative articles are 3.2 percent more likely to appear on the front page
(Column (1)), while positive articles are 18.8 percent less likely to appear on the front page
(Column (2)), compared to articles that are neither coded as negative or positive, or neutral
sentiment articles. The results are comparable when including both in the same model (Column
(3)). What is interesting is that the asymmetry in the effects – the likelihood that positive articles
do not appear on the front page is greater than that of negative articles to appear in terms of absolute
magnitude. The results suggest that front page coverage skews towards articles with negative or
neutral sentiment.

3.3. Crash Probabilities
In this section, we test whether media sentiment is a factor influencing the crash
probabilities from the survey. The availability bias predicts that investors will overweight recent
information in forming crash probabilities. We consider a set of events that may be particularly
salient to investors: media sentiment during market downturns and upswings. Given that surveys
are sent to both individual and institutional investors, we further expect the effects of availability
to be more pronounced for unsophisticated investors (e.g., individual investors).
Before turning to the tests, we consider the internal validity of the crash probabilities with
the other survey responses. One potential concern is that the crash probabilities may reflect
severity due to the wording of the question rather than their actual beliefs. This would suggest
18

inconsistency between the crash probabilities and the responses to other questions where the
wording is unlikely to be confused with severity. We assess this concern in two ways.
First, we estimate a model that examines whether the crash probabilities can be explained
by responses to the questions related to stock market valuation. The key explanatory variables
include the expected percentage change in the DJIA over the next six months (Expected Returns);
a dummy based upon whether stock prices when compared to true fundamental value is too high
(DTooHighValuation); a dummy based upon whether stock prices when compared to true fundamental
value is too low (DTooLowValuation); a dummy based upon whether the investor is inclined to sell
stocks overall (DSell); and a dummy based upon whether the investor is inclined to buy stocks
overall (DBuy).23 Table A.5 displays the results. We estimate the model separately for individual
(Panel A) and institutional (Panel B) investors. The explanatory variables are mostly significant,
and their coefficients are signed in a manner consistent with the crash probability responses. The
magnitudes are comparable across the individual and institutional investors subsamples. The
results suggest internal validity for the crash probabilities.
Second, we directly test whether specific words in the survey question influences the crash
probability responses. Different versions of the survey question that alter keywords that may
potentially prime severity in the question phrasing are randomly presented to 500 subjects using
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk.24 We estimate a regression model where the dependent variable is

23

The explanatory variables are constructed from the following questions: (i) “How much of a change in percentage
terms do you expect in 6 months [for the Dow Jones Industrial Average]?”, (ii) “Stock prices in the United States,
when compared with measures of true fundamental value or sensible investment value, are [too high, too low, or about
right].”, and (iii) “Are you inclined to buy stocks overall, or sell stocks overall, or hold steady?”
24
Specifically, we consider four versions of the survey question: the original question; one that excludes the words
“catastrophic” and replaces the word “crash” with “decline”; one that replaces “like that of October 28, 1929 or
October 19, 1987” with “of 20%”; and one that excludes the words “including the case that a crash occurred in the
other countries and spreads to the U.S.”.

19

the crash probability response and the explanatory variables are dummies associated with
keywords, along with date fixed effects.25 We do not find any significant differences in the crash
probabilities across the different versions.26 Overall, these results provide evidence that the crash
probability responses are unlikely to be driven by confusion over the wording of the survey
question.
We assess the influence of media sentiment on investor crash probabilities by estimating
the following econometric specification:
𝜋, = 𝛽 𝑟
𝛽 𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡

,

×𝑉 +𝛽 𝑟

+𝛽 𝑉 +𝛽 𝑟

,

+𝛽 𝜎

,

+𝛽 𝜋

,

+ 𝛽 ln(1 + #𝐴𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑙𝑒𝑠) + 𝐹𝐸(𝐷𝑎𝑦 𝑜𝑓 𝑊𝑒𝑒𝑘, 𝑀𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ) + 𝜉 ,

+
(2)

where the dependent variable 𝜋 , is the probability assessment of investor i at time t.
The tests focus on the effects of media coverage of market returns from the previous day
on investor responses on the same date the investor fills out the survey. The explanatory variables
are as specified above, and include prior day returns; media sentiment; and the interaction term
between returns and media sentiment. We focus on the interaction term. Media sentiment may be
negative in some cases due to reasons unrelated to market conditions, so that media sentiment
during market downturns and upswings may be more informative. Moreover, investors may be
more likely to associate market events with their crash beliefs when media coverage is congruently
valanced.

25

The survey was conducted over three dates: July 14, July 15, and July 16, 2016.
In particular, the crash probabilities for the versions that exclude the words “catastrophic” and replaces the word
“crash” with “decline” (estimate = 0.007, t-value = 1.22); replace “like that of October 28, 1929 or October 19, 1987”
with “of 20%” (estimate = 0.013, t-value = 0.57); and exclude the words “including the case that a crash occurred in
the other countries and spreads to the U.S.” (estimate = 0.010, t-value = 0.63) are not significantly different from those
of the original question.
26

20

We also include control variables related to media sentiment over the past month, past
month returns, the average crash probabilities of other investors of the same type over the previous
30 days, past month market volatility, and the total number of articles published over the past
month. All models include day-of-the-week and month fixed effects. Robust standard errors
clustered by date level are used to calculate the test statistics.
Table 6 presents the results when using the positive and negative articles for the media
sentiment terms.

The odd-numbered columns report the results for the individual investor

subsample, while the even-numbered columns report those for the institutional investor subsample.
The results are reported separately where the return variables are based upon the CRSP-VW
(Columns (1) and (2)), S&P 500 (Columns (3) and (4)), and DJIA (Columns (5) and (6)) indices
for completeness.
The results indicate that, regardless of the market index used, individual investors’
responses are significantly associated with negative article counts during market downturns. Only
the interaction term for the negative article counts is statistically significant. In contrast, the
interaction terms are not significant for institutional investors. In terms of magnitudes, the
interaction term effects are approximately five times larger for individual investors. The marginal
effects of a 5% decline in the market and a standard deviation increase in the number of negative
articles range 4.98% to 5.11% (0.82% to 1.04%) based upon the interaction terms across the
individual (institutional) investor specifications. Positive article counts are not significantly
associated with crash probabilities for either set of investors, while negative article counts are
significantly associated with higher crash probabilities for only institutional investors. These
results suggest that negative sentiment is only significant following market downturns. After
controlling for the media sentiment terms, returns for the prior day do not have significant
21

coefficients. Past month returns are significant only for individual investors, where lower returns
are associated with higher crash probability estimates.
The analysis next examines the results when using Sentiment for the media sentiment
terms. Table 7 displays the results, and is formatted similarly to Table 6. Consistent with the
results for the article counts, the interaction term for Sentiment is negative and statistically
significant only for individual investors – negative sentiment during market downturns is
associated with higher crash probabilities. The (two-tailed) null is rejected at the 10% level for
the two broader indexes, and at the 5% level for the DJIA. 27
To further test whether the variation in the probability estimates may be attributable to the
availability heuristic, we augment the regression models of Table 7 to assess whether similar
effects for media sentiment can be found following market rallies and declines over the previous
30 days. If investors use an availability heuristic, they are more likely to have the most recent
return “top of mind”. In addition to the media sentiment interaction terms with same day returns,
an interaction term is added between media sentiment and returns over the previous 30 days. We
also control for interactions between news over the past month and the return variables. Media
sentiment over the past month is likely to capture recent trends in fundamentals. Two additional
interaction terms are added between past month media sentiment and returns over the previous day
and month.
The results of Table 8 are similar but stronger for the same day return interaction terms.
Again, the coefficients are only significant for individual investors.

27

The interaction terms

A potential explanation for the difference in statistical significance across the indexes is that the Wall Street Journal
is a Dow Jones publication and the periodical that created and maintains the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This may
incline WSJ reporters to write about the dynamics of the DJIA index as opposed to others.

22

associated with previous 30-day returns are statistically insignificant, and their coefficients are
considerably smaller in absolute magnitude than those for the previous day returns. In contrast,
coefficients for the interaction terms between past month media sentiment and past day returns are
negative and statistically significant only for individual investors. The coefficients for the
interaction terms between past month media sentiment and past month returns are positive and
statistically significant only for institutional investors.
We next consider whether the significance of media sentiment varies according to sections
that are more likely to attract attention. The availability heuristic would predict that the impact of
recent market returns on the respondent’s probability assessment would be more salient when
mentioned in sections that the respondent is more likely to pay attention to. We decompose
Sentiment according to whether (i) it is based upon lead paragraphs (SentimentLead) or other
paragraphs (SentimentNotLead), and (ii) it is based upon front page articles (SentimentFront) or other
articles (SentimentNotFront). We expect the results to be pronounced for the media sentiment
measures when constructed using lead paragraphs and front page articles.
Table 9 presents the results.

Panel A displays the results for SentimentLead and

SentimentNotLead. Panel B displays the results for SentimentFront and SentimentNotFront. We find that
the association between media sentiment and subjective probabilities during market downturns is
driven by lead paragraphs and front page articles – interaction terms between past day returns and
non-lead paragraphs, or non-front page articles, do not have a significant coefficient.
Prior work (Goetzmann et. al., 2014) documents the relationship between unusual cloud
cover and investor forecasts of the stock market. Weather – for the most part -- is orthogonal to
market conditions but has been shown to affect mood. To test whether the associations we have

23

found may be due to a general shift in mood related to market decline and media reporting, as
opposed to conditioning on the market and the press, we tested whether the cloud cover variable
had a significant association with subjective crash probability. The results (unreported) were
insignificant.

3.4. Exogenous Rare Events
One drawback thus far in the analysis is that media sentiment measures, stock market
returns and individual probability assessments of a future crash may be jointly influenced by a
common unidentified variable. This could be an economic event or condition that raises risk. We
have included volatility measures in our regressions to capture this, but there may be other relevant
variables we have omitted. In an efficient market, the price level of the stock market itself should
capture value-relevant information, and thus the prior day’s market return represents an adjustment
to any potentially important but unidentified information. It still may be the case that the media
interpretation of prior returns might reasonably convey information pertinent to crash probability
assessment. Ideally, we would like a variable that puts the notion of a disaster “top of mind” but
is orthogonal to the economy and stock market.
In this section, we examine the relationship between earthquakes and investor probability
assessments. We exploit the ZIP code location of a subset of the Shiller survey respondents to
identify regional events that plausibly make rare disasters more cognitively available. Since we
focus on crash probabilities for the aggregate market, a moderate regional earthquake is unlikely
to have economic relevance for a future stock market crash. Specifically, we use the occurrence
of earthquakes whose epicenter is within 30 miles of the investor. The timing of earthquakes are
24

exogenous to current market conditions, but should be salient to individuals located close to the
epicenter given that the earthquakes can be physically detected. Other studies have found that the
realization of a low probability event increases subjective probabilities of the event occurring
again, but also increases the subjective probabilities of other, unrelated events (Johnson and
Tversky, 1983). We therefore expect earthquake events to induce overestimation of the likelihood
of market crashes. This would support the role of affect in influencing the reliance on an
availability heuristic.
Earthquakes of stronger magnitudes may have direct effects on economic conditions,
which in turn can affect stock market conditions. However, the empirical evidence on this link is
mixed. Ferreira and Karali (2015) show that stock markets do not exhibit a significant reaction
within five days of strong earthquakes. In contrast, Shiller (2000b) points to the Tokyo stock
market reaction to the earthquake in Kobe, Japan on January 17, 1995, which measured at 7.2 on
the Richter scale. The Nikkei index fell by 8 percent overall within ten days of the earthquake,
though significant price movements did not transpire until after one week. This market reaction
far exceeded an official estimate, which was eventually set at approximately $100 billion. While
circumstantial, the delay in and magnitude of the market reaction to the Kobe earthquake suggest
a mix of fundamental and sentiment factors.
To address potential confounding effects of the economic impact of stronger earthquakes,
we distinguish between weak magnitude, or earthquakes with a magnitude between 2.5 up to 5.5,
and strong magnitude, or earthquakes with a magnitude above 5.5. The cutoffs are based upon
information from the United State Geological Services [USGS], which classifies earthquakes with
magnitudes above 2.5 as physically detectable, and earthquakes with magnitudes above 5.5 as
inflicting at least minor damage to buildings and other structures.
25

Earthquake data from 1900 to 2015 is collected from the USGS, and includes dates,
magnitudes, and locations of each event. We match the earthquake data to the investor survey data
using the centroid of the ZIP code location available for some of the survey respondents. From
2007, the survey includes the ZIP code of most of the survey respondents. Approximately 7.99%
of the survey respondents experienced a weak earthquake within a 30-mile radius, while 0.2%
experienced a strong earthquake.
To assess statistical significance, we construct the bootstrapped distribution of the model
estimates by creating pseudo-events based generated using historical frequencies of earthquakes
for each location from 1900-2006. The p-values for the model estimates based upon the actual
events are estimated using 1,000 sets of pseudo-events.
Table 10 presents the results. Columns (1) through (3) display the results for the individual
investor subsample, while Columns (4) through (6) present the results for the institutional investor
subsample. We find that weak magnitude earthquakes have a positive and significant association
with investor crash probabilities, but only for individual investors. The results are robust even
after controlling for historical earthquake frequency for the investor’s location, strong magnitude
earthquakes, and the market-related control variables from Table 7. The coefficients on the strong
magnitude earthquakes are generally statistically significant – perhaps due to the small number of
such event in the sample.

3.5. Aggregate Fund Flows
We next turn our focus to investor behavior by examining how subjective crash
probabilities affect aggregate flows to mutual funds. While the results from the previous sections
26

show that financial media sentiment is strongly associated with investor beliefs related to stock
market crash probabilities, it is unclear how the crash probabilities in turn affect investor decisions.
To investigate, we obtain daily data on mutual fund flows from TrimTabs from 2003
through 2015. We restrict the sample to U.S. Equity and U.S. Bond funds. We define daily
percentage fund flows for each category group as the aggregate net fund flows scaled by the
previous day’s aggregate total net assets. The sample period coincides with the period when the
surveys are administered with greater regularity, particularly for individual investors. Additional
details about the data can be found in Goetzmann, Massa, and Rouwenhorst (2000).
We start by constructing a daily time-series of the investor crash probabilities () from the
survey. Given that some dates only have a single survey respondent, rolling, one-week moving
averages are used to construct with the requirement that there be at least five survey respondents
over the estimation window.28 For periods when this requirement cannot be satisfied, the last
available value of  is used. We distinguish crash probability estimates by investor type: the
moving average when only surveys for individual (Indiv.) or institutional (Inst.) investors are used
for the crash probability measure.
There may be unobservable common factors related to fundamentals unaccounted for by
our tests that may affect the crash probabilities of both investor types, potentially biasing the tests.
If these factors affect both investor types similarly, then the difference in crash probabilities
between these investor types should help mitigate the influence of omitted factors. As such, we
also use the difference between tIndiv. and tInst. (Indiv.-Inst.) for the tests. In other words, while the

28

The results are not sensitive to using alternative estimation windows, including a three day or a two week window.

27

crash probabilities of either investor type may be confounded by other fundamental factors, the
difference is likely to be exogenous.
Table 11 presents the results. The dependent variable in each specification is the daily
percentage fund flows for either equity (Panel A) or bond (Panel B) funds. For each panel, ten
different models are estimated for each crash probability measure, or 30 models for all three
measures. Columns (1) through (10) display the results when taking the forward lag of the
dependent variable from one to ten days, respectively. 29 The same control variables and fixed
effects used in the time-series regression models from Table 2 are included in all the models.
For equity fund flows, we find that only individual investor crash probabilities significantly
predict future flows.

While statistically insignificant for dates immediately following the

estimation window, the coefficients for crash probabilities of individual investors are negative and
statistically significant from date t+4 and on. The magnitudes are largest for date t+6 before
declining.

In contrast, the coefficients for crash probabilities of institutional investors are

statistically insignificant for all periods considered. The results for the probability differences are
similar to those for individual investors: the coefficients are all negative and are statistically
significant from date t+5 before becoming insignificant for date t+8. The results suggest that
investors represented in the data may not immediately respond to changes in crash beliefs, but
rather may respond gradually over time.
For bond fund flows, we find that both individual and institutional investor crash
probabilities significantly predict future flows.

The probability differences, however, is

statistically insignificant for all periods. The coefficients for the crash probabilities of both

29

Only trading days are considered given that these are the only days that the flow data is available.

28

investor types are positive and statistically significant for various periods considered, though the
results appear stronger for institutional investors. While these results may be suggestive of
investor reactions to higher stock market crash probabilities, the probability differences are
statistically insignificant.

4. Conclusion and Discussion
Considerable experimental work has demonstrated how subjective probability assessments
can be manipulated by priming or framing. The explicit questions in Robert Shiller’s Investor
Confidence Surveys afford an opportunity to examine factors that influence probability
assessments about rare stock market crashes. These probability assessments are potentially
important because they may determine such critical things as stock market participation, the
demand for insurance against crashes and, to the extent that the investors surveyed are
representative of marginal investors, perhaps even the equity premium.

In this paper we

summarized nearly 10,000 individual and institutional probability assessments of a specific kind
of market crash over the period from 1989 through 2015.
We find that the crash probabilities are quite high – unreasonably high given the incidence
of such events in U.S. capital market history. Our results may contribute to the literature about
rare disasters. The reported probabilities are consistent with the parameterization in Barro (2006)
for crashes of a 25% magnitude which identify the conditions for an equity risk premium in the
7% range and with the parametrization in Wachter (2013) for a Sharpe ratio in excess of 1.
The main focus of the paper is a test of the availability bias, with particular attention to the
potential role played by the financial press in accentuating awareness of negative market outcomes.
29

Consistent with the news reporting past events, prior day returns are associated with media
sentiment. We find some evidence of asymmetry in reporting. Extreme negative returns have a
greater effect on media sentiment and extreme positive returns. Market returns appear to influence
negative media sentiment terms for several days, whereas the association with positive media
sentiment is confined to a single day. The effects on sentiment remains when focusing on sections
of the newspaper (lead paragraphs or front page articles) that are more likely to be viewed by
readers, and after controlling for the sentiment of sections that are less likely to be viewed. These
findings are generally consistent with a negative bias in the financial media. It is also consistent
with negative news being potentially more relevant to investors than positive news. There is
considerable evidence that negative news garners more attention and reflection. Therefore, the
asymmetry may be a response to rational reader demand.
Turning to the questionnaire results, we find that the coincidence of negative sentiment
news and a negative market return is associated with a higher probability assessment of a future
crash by individual investors. The evidence for institutional investors is statistically insignificant.
We perform a number of robustness checks that provide more color to these results. Front-page
placement and lead paragraphs appear to drive the main results. We also show a strong negative
association between the crash probability assessments of individual investors with future flows to
equity-based mutual funds.
Finally, we use local earthquakes as a priming instrument for rare event availability. We
find that recent earthquakes in the immediate vicinity of the respondent are associated with a higher
probability assessment of a “catastrophic” stock market crash.

This lends credence to the

hypothesis that the availability heuristic plays a role in subjective probability assessment about a
crash. Our results are consistent with the findings of Da et. al. (2015) who find a correlation
30

between high-frequency measures of investor sentiment – in their case internet search terms – and
investor capital flows. Our evidence also support the findings of Tetlock (2007), Engleberg and
Parsons (2011), Kräussl and Mirgorodskaya (2014) and Yuan (2015) – all of whom document
significant media influence on investor behavior and asset returns. Our distinctive contribution to
this literature is the use of an explicit subjective probability assessment of a crash.
Our findings about asymmetric adjustment of beliefs to positive vs. negative stimuli
coincide well with the Kuhnen (2014) findings that negative outcomes are more likely to cause
subjects to update beliefs. One interesting effect that would attenuate the results we document is
selective attention. Sicherman et. al. (2015) and Karlsson et. al. (2009) show that investors are
less prone to check their investment accounts when the market has declined or is volatile. We
might expect subjects who avoid current information, conditional upon negative outcomes or
sentiment, to weight them relatively less in probability assessments. Perhaps this effect explains
the significance of the media interaction term we document – absent the financial press calling
attention to the potential for a crash conditional on a market decline, investors would ignore it.

Table 5: Lead Paragraph and Article Placement
The table displays the results from OLS regression models where the dependent variable is the sentiment scores for
only lead paragraphs across all articles (SentimentLead) or only articles appearing on the front page (SentimentFront). All
regressions include the control variables of Table 3. Columns (1) and (2) also control for the sentiment scores for nonlead paragraphs. Columns (3) and (4) also control for the sentiment scores for articles not appearing on the front page.
The results are displayed separately where the return variables are based upon CRSP-VW
(NYSE/AMEX/Nasdaq/Arca), S&P 500, or DJIA indices. Newey-West standard errors are displayed in parentheses.
Statistical significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels are denoted as ***, **, and *, respectively.

Table 10: Earthquakes and Crash Probabilities
The table displays the results from OLS regression models where the dependent variables are the investor crash
probabilities (). The results are displayed separately for individual (Indiv) and institutional (Inst) investors. The key
explanatory variables are dummies associated with whether the investor is located within a 30 mile radius of the
epicenter of an earthquake that occurred within the past 30 days. Weak magnitudes are earthquakes with a magnitude
of 2.5 up to 5.5. Strong magnitudes are earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 5.5. Control variables and fixed
effects from Table 7 are included where indicated, but not reported. Historical frequency of earthquakes for each
location are included where indicated, but not reported. The return variables for the control variables are based upon
the DJIA index. p-values based upon bootstrapped distributions of the model estimates are displayed in brackets.
Statistical significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels are denoted as ***, **, and *, respectively.

Table 11: Aggregate Fund Flows and Crash Probabilities
The dependent variable is %Flow, defined as the aggregate daily percentage mutual fund flow for either equity (Panel A) or bond (Panel B) funds. The investor
crash probabilities () are estimated as a one-week moving average when there are at least five survey respondents over the past week, or the last value available
when there are less than five survey respondents over the past week. The crash probabilities are estimated separately for individual (Indiv.) and institutional (Inst.)
investors. Control variables and fixed effects from Table 2 are included where indicated, but not reported. The return variables for the control variables are based
upon the DJIA index. Newey-West standard errors are displayed in parentheses. Statistical significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels are denoted as ***, **, and
*, respectively.

Table A.5: Internal Consistency of Investor Crash Probabilities
The table displays the results from OLS regression models where the dependent variables are the investor crash
probabilities (). The results are displayed separately for institutional and individual investors in Panels A and B,
respectively. The explanatory variables include the expected percentage change in the DJIA over the next six months
(Expected Returns); a dummy based upon whether stock prices when compared to true fundamental value is too high
(D TooHighValuation); a dummy based upon whether stock prices when compared to true fundamental value is too low (D
TooLowValuation); a dummy based upon whether the investor is inclined to sell stocks overall (D Sell); and a dummy based
upon whether the investor is inclined to buy stocks overall (D Buy). Fixed effects based upon the month and day-ofweek when the survey was filled out and month are included in the models, but are not reported. Standard errors are
clustered on the date level and are displayed in parentheses. Statistical significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels are
