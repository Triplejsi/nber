short—term horizons expectations exhibit bandwagon effects, while at

longer—term horizons they show the reverse. A 10 percent yen appreciation
generates the expectation of a further appreciation of 2.11 percent over the
following week, for example, but a depreciation of 3.1$ percent over the

following year. At any horizon, investors would do better to reduce the
absolute magnitude of expected depreciation. The true spot rate process
behaves more like a random walk.

is

much less easily observed than interest rates.

that

the expected rate of depreciation can be

the 3 per cent yen—dollar forward discount that prevailed in the early
represented investors' expectations that the dollar would in the

19805

future depreciate, presumably back toward some equilibrium level. An

implication is that investors acting on this expectation — "speculators"
— had a lower demand for dollars during the strong—dollar period

alternative

view is that the expected rate of depreciation is

closer to zero than to the forward discount. Many empirical studies

have found that the rationally, or mathematically, expected rate pt

depreciation is close to zero, (i.e., that

the

exchange rate follows a

random walk) so.there is a prima facie case that the same is true of

investor expectations. If expected depreciation is zero ("static

expectations"), then there is no stabilizing effect in the form of
speculators selling a currency

when it is

strong. A

more

extreme view

is

that there is a bandwagon effect: at each point during the 1980—814 period,
the appreciation of the dollar against the yen generated expectations of

further futur appreciation, notwithstanding the fact that the dollar was
selling at a forward discount against the yen.

It would follow from this

view that speculators ——again, defined as investors acting on the basis
of expectations of exchange rate changes—— drove the yen/dollar rate to a

higher level than would have otherwise prevailed. It would follow that
speculators have exaggerated the reverse swing in 1985—86 as well. Whether
expectations are stabilizing or destabilizing in this sense is one of the
questions examined in this paper.

—3—
Another question, which would be of particular interest to

policy—makers

if' one were to conclude that exchange rates have been

undesirably unstable, is whether government intervention in the foreign

exchange market otters a way of affecting the exchange rate even in the
absence of a change in macroeconomic policy. The question of

whether

intervention can have an effect, even if sterilized so as to leave the
money supply unchanged, is generally thought to depend on the question
whether yen and dollar assets are imperfect substitutes in investors'

portfolios. Under the special case in which assets are perfect
substitutes, investors will be willing to absorb indefinitely—large
quantities into their portfolios, as long as the assets pay the going rate

of return, with no effect on the price of the asset. The condition one
would like to test is uncovered interest parity: risk—neutral investors
drive the yen interest rate into equality with the dollar interest rate
corrected for expected depreciation.
Exchange rate expectations are crucial for each of these

important questions, and for others as well. Measuring investors'
expectations is always difficult. Probably the most commonly—used measure
of expected depreciation is the forward discount, which arbitrage (in the
absence of barriers to capital flows) in turn equates to the interest

differential. But using the forward discount or interest differential
prejudges

the question of perfect substitutability. The other common

approach is to assume that market expectations can be measured as the

mathematical expectation of the realized exchange rate within the sample

—4—

period,

conditional on some particular information set. But this approach,

too, prejudges much.
This

paper proposes a third measure, survey data on exchange rate

expectations, to answer various questions of interest regarding the
yen/dollar

market. The data come from three sources. The American Express

Bank Review surveys 250—300 central bankers, private bankers, corporate
treasurers, and economists once a year, with some surveys going back to

1976. The Economist's Financial Report has conducted telephone surveys of
currency traders and currency—room economists at 14 leading international

banks each six weeks since June 1981. Money Market Services, Inc. (MMS),
has also been surveying approximately 30 currency traders by telephone
every two weeks since January 1953, and every week sInce October 19811.

These data are discussed and analyzed in Frankel and Froot (1985) and Froot

and Frankel (1986). The results reported in the present paper are new,
in two respects. First, they focus exclusively on the yen/dollar rate,
where the earlier two papers examined simultaneously the yen, pound, mark,

French franc, and Swiss franc. Secondly, they distinguish between
short—term expectations on the one hand——at horizons of one week, two weeks
or one month——as reported in the MMS survey, and long—term expectations on
the other hand——at horizons of six months or twelve

the

months——as reported in

other two surveys. The short—term and long—term expectations turn out

to behave very differently.

3The first paper investigates how investors form expectations from the
contemporaneous spot rate and other variables. The second paper
investigates the standard regression equation of exchange rate changes
against the forward discount. Both papers include tests of the proposition
that the expectations measured in the survey are unbiased.

—5—
In section 2 we relate expected depreciation as measured by the

surveys to the

forward discount, in order to test

the hypothesis of

perfect substitutability. In section 3 we investigate some standard models
of expectations formation——distributed lag, adaptive, and regressive

expectations. In each case one motivation is to see if expectations are
stabilizing, versus the alternative of static or even bandwagon

expectations. In each case a second motivation, which we pursue in section
M, is to test whether the expectations formation process is similar to the
process describing the mathematical expectation or the actual spot rate,
that is, whether the expectations are unbiased conditional on the

particular information set. Included here is a test of the proposition
that investors would do better in forming their expectations if they put

more weight on the contemporaneous spot rate and less weit on other
variables. Finally,in section 5 we briefly summarize our findings.

II. The Forward Discount: Risk Premium or Expected Depreciation?
Our first question is whether investors treat assets denominated

in yen and dollars as perfect substitutes. If positions in different
currencies were perfectly substitutable, investors would be indifferent
between holding open positions in foreign assets and selling the assets

forward. This would imply that the forward discount exactly equals the
expected depreciation of the currency:

k

e
(1)

As

fd

t

—6—
where fd is the forward discount at term k (the log of the current forward rate
minus the log of the current spot rate) and

is the log of the

expected spot rate k periods into the future minus the log of the current

spot rate. On the other hand, if investors need to be rewarded for
exposure to the additional risk or holding an open position in the foreign
currency, they will demand a risk premium in addition to the forward rate:

(2)

L5t+k =

fd — rp.

Because both expected depreciation, Ase, and the risk premium,
rp,

are unobservable, additional information or assumptions are required

isolate

to

them. If, for example, we were to assume that realized future spot

rates are unbiased measures of expected spot rates, then we could estimate
expected depreciation (and therefore the risk premium) from the time—series
of realized depreciation.M A second method of identification wotild be
to assume the validity of a particular model of investor portfolio
optimization (such as 1-lodrick and Srivastava (198±4) or Frankel (1982)) and

use it to obtain estimates of the risk premium. A third approach, the one
taken in this paper, is to employ survey data on expected depreciation.
While surveys of agents' expectations may in many contexts be less
desirable than data on their actual market behavior, the surveys are direct

estimates

that do

not require us to assume any

particular model of expected

or of the risk premium.

Perfect substitutability, or uncovered interest parity (which, given
covered interest parity, is art equivalent condition), is tested for Japan
versus the United States by Ito (198±4) and McKenzie (1986).

of sample periods as well. In the first column, averages of actual
depreciation are reported. During the periods of the one—week and
one-month

KMS surveys, from October 19814 to February 1986, the dollar

depreciated

against the yen at an annual rate of 27.5 percent. During the

period

twelve

month Economist surveys, the rate of depreciation is much smaller.
Column (2) reports corresponding averages of the survey expected

depreciation. The time—series means of realized depreciation perform very
poorly as measures of the investors' expectations reported in the surveys.
In contrast to the considerable swings in the sign and magnitude of average
actual spot rate changes, the survey consistently called for upward
movements

in the value of the yen against the dollar. The expectations are

same in sign, but larger in magnitude than the time—series averages of
the forward discount reported in column (3).

of appreciation and periods of depreciation the risk premium is

negative.

Far from regarding the two assets as perfect substitutes,

investors appear to be willing to sacrifice the substantially higher

expected returns from holding yen in order to hold dollars. Indeed, the

magnitudes are surprisingly large. In the three—month Economist data, for
example,- respondents expected they could earn an additional 7.99 percent

per annum on assets denominated in yen compared with dollars. It is hard
to justify such large exchange risk premia using the theory of optimal
portfolio choice with conventional estimates of risk—aversion (Frankel
1985, and Mehra and Prescott 1985).
-

One explanation proposed for why investors were willing to hold

dollars at lower expected rates of return is that the United States
provided a "safe haven" from capital controls and other political risks
(for example, Dooley and Isard, 1985; but see Franke]. and Froot, 1986).
Grounds

for this argument seem especially lacking vis—a—vis the yen: Japan

was not directly involved in either the Latin American debt crisis or
concerns of "Europessimism", and the 1980s have been a period during which
Japanese financial markets have been steadily liberalized, if anything
reducing fears of prospective capital controls. Furthermore, only exchange
rate risk should in theory be relevant, not factors relating to the
political jurisdiction of Japan, because the spot and forward rates are
determined offshore in the Euroinarket. But whatever the reason, table 1
suggests that investors distinguish between assets denominated in different

currencies, demanding a higher return on the yen than on dollars. This is
also clear in Figure 1.

While the evidence so far indicates that a risk premium exists,

it is not necessarily evidence that the risk premium varies over time. The
proposition that the risk premium is time-varying rather than constant
comes

out of

most of the conventional empirical literature on the forward

-

—9—

market, as wu]] as the theury of optimizing i]lvestoz-s, and is also a
property

of models in which sterilized foreign exchange intervention has

important effects.

Thus we would also like to know whether changes in the forward

discount indicate a changing risk premium. This is precisely the type of
time—varying risk premium that the literature testing forward rate unbiasedness

has sought.5 The degree to which changes in the forward discount reflect
changes in the risk premium can be inferred from a regression of expected
depreciation on the forward discount:

A finding that b is near zero or less than zero is evidence that changes in

the forward discèunt reflect changes in the risk premiwa, while a finding
that b is near one is evidence that such changes in the forward discount
reflect something else, namely equivalent changes in expected depreciation.
The conventional approach to testing equation (2) uses ex post
spot rate changes to infer the behavior of the unobservable market expected

5Fama (1984), Hodrick and Srivastava (1984, 1986) and Froot and Frankel
(1986) discuss whether changes in the forward discount primarily reflect
changes in the risk premium or in expected depreciation.

depreciation.

Under the assumption of rational expectations, the future

spot rate realizations are viewed as noisy measures of investors'

expectations. This noise is assumed to be uncorrelated with the forward
discount, and therefore can be identified with the residual term in

equation (3). Table 2 reports estimates of equation (3), using ex post
changes in the spot rate as the lefthand—side variable.6 All of the
point estimates of b are less than zero! and most are significantly less

than one. The conventional approach would therefore seem to imply that
changes in the forward discount predominantly reflect changes in the risk
premi urn.

Our alternative test of equation (3) uses the survey expected
depreciation on the lefthand side, in place of the actual spot rate change.

The existence of heterogeneous beliefs, the use or the median survey
response, and the lack of perfect synchronization, are reasons to suspect

that the surveys may also be noisy estimates or market expectations. Now
the error term in the regression equation may be interpreted as measurement

error in the surveys. We make the assumption that this measurement error
is random, which is analogous to the assumption of rational expectations
used in the conventional technique above, i.e., that the expectation error
is random..

6A11 of the regre8sions in this paper are estimated using OLS. The
Economost surveys, MMS one—month and three—month surveys, and the AMEX
twelve—month survey were conducted at intervals shorter than their
respective forecast horizons. This implies that the error term in equation
(2) is serially correlated even under the null hypothesis. Consistent
estimates of the standard errors were obtained by the usual method of
moments procedure (see Hansen and Hodrick (1980), or Froot and Frankel
(1986) for a more detailed description). For additional information on the
construction of the data sets used in this paper, see the appendix to
Frankel and Froot (1985).

Though the two approaches are analogous, there are several
reasons to prefer the surveys to the actual spot rate data in tests of
equation
spot

(3). The first

is

that, under

the hypothesis that

both actual

rates and the surveys contain only the market expectation plus purely

random noise, the noise element in actual spot rate changes turns out to be

much larger than the noise element in the surveys. In Froot and Frankel
(1986, table 3) we report estimates of the variances of actual and survey

expected spot rate changes and find that the former is greater by a factor

of

7

to 10. This implies that, for

estimate of b may be obtained

any given

sample, a more precise

by using the surveys. A second reason to

prefer the surveys is that they free us from imposing the restriction that
there are no systematic prediction errors in the sample, a proposition that

we would like to be able to test rather than impose. Such systematic
errors, which the conventional technique must assume away, could occur
because of a failure of rational expectations, or because important events
which affect expectations did not happen to occur a representative number
of times in the sample (the "peso problem"), rendering the ex post
distribution of spat rate changes a biased estimator of the ex ante
distribution.

Tests of equation (3) using the survey data on the lefthand side

are reported in table 3. In each of the seven data sets the estimates of b
are greater than those in table 2. In most cases we cannot reject the
hypothesis that b equals one. In other words, we cannot reject the
hypothesis that the survey risk premia reported in table 1 do not vary over

time. There is not even much sign that the risk premium on yen had an

exogenous downward trend during the 1981—85 period, as it would under the
hypothesis that internationalization was causing investors around the world
to become more willing to hold yen. (Figure 1 shows, on the negative axis,
the risk premium on dollars, i.e., the rorward discount or interest

differential minus the expected appreciation of the yen.) In all cases,
however, we can reject the hypothesis of perfect substitutability, a—O and

b=1 jointly. In other words, the risk premium does show up in the constant
term.

To summarize, in Table 3, as in Table 1, it appears that the ex
post depreciation nay be a very poor measure of expected depreciation.

Table

3 provides evidence that changes in the forward discount reflect

primarily changes in expected depreciation rather than changes in the risk
premium.

111. Models of Expected DepreciatLDrl
The results from the first three tables suggest that

there

is

information on expectations in the surveys which is not contained in either

realized spot rates or forward rates. We may thus gain new insights by
using this data source to reexamine several old formulations of exchange
rate expectations that

are standard to the literature.7

A general framework for testing various specifications of
expectations is to model expectations of the future spot rate as giving
some weight to the contemporaneous spot rate as well as some weight to

extrapolate the most recent change in the spot rate, so that

g is negative,

then equation (5) may be termed "bandwagon" expectations. In this latter

case a current appreciation by itself generates expectations of further

future appreciation. By defining "speculation" as the buying and selling

Table 5 presents tests of equation ('1). Estimates of changes in S
were calculated using CPI's to measure changes in the relative price levels
in the United States and Japan, under the assumption of purchasing power

parity (PPP). Once again, there is strong evidence that shorter—term
expectations are formed in a manner different from longer—term expectations.
The shorter forecast horizons all yield estimates of t.nat 0 are negative,

additional evidence that shorter—term speculation may be destabilizing.
Indeed, the 1—week data suggest that the contemporaneous deviation from the
long—run equilibrium is expected on average to grow by 3 percent over the

subsequent seven days. In other words, short—term expectations are

explosive.
(1985)

What about the longer—term horizons? In

Frankel and Froot

we found a highly significant speed of regression

horizons. The longer-term estimates of e

exhibit

in Table 5 do not, however,

regressivity for the yen that is as hily significant. Only the

American Express 12—month data, which is available as far back as 1976,

shows an estimate that is significant even at the 10 percent level. It may
be that relative CPI's are not the appropriate indicator of the equilibrium

yen! dollar rate. It has been suggested that due to rapid productivity
growth in Japan, Japanese producers gain in international competitiveness
even to the extent that F?!' is observed to hold. Marston (1986)

demonstrates that even though estimates of real exchange rate changes using
CPIs show real appreciation of the yen against the dollar over the last
decade, estimates using manufactured goods prices give a very different
answer. 9

The final specification we consider is adaptive expectations. In

Table 6 reports estimates of equation (9). Once again, the
weight placed on the variable other than the contemporaneous spot rate, in
this case the lagged expectation, is sensitive to the forecast horizon of

the surveys. Shorter—term expectations again appear to be strongly
destabilizing, while the longer—term expectations are significantly

stabilizing. For example, the one—week data indicate that an unanticipated
appreciation of 10 percent by itself generates an expectation of

continued appreciation over the subsequent seven days of 1.3 percent. At
the other extreme, the Economist 12—month data suggest that an
unanticipated appreciation of 10 percent generates an offsetting
expectation of depreciation of 1.5 percent over the subsequent year.

The results of Tables 4, 5, and 6 suggest that in all three of
our standard models of expectations——extrapolative, regressive and
adaptive——short—term and long—term expectations behave very differently

— 18 —

from one another. Longer—term expectations consistently appear to be
stabilizing, while shorter—term forecasts seem to have a destabilizing

nature. Within each of the above tables, it is as if there are actually
two models of expectations operating, one at each end of the spectrum of
forecast horizons, and a blend in between.
It may be that each respondent is thinking to himself or herself,
"1 know that in the long run the exchange rate must return to the

equilibrium level dictated by fundamentals. But in the short run I will
ride the current trend a little longer. I only have to be careful to watch
for the turning point and to get out of the market before everyone else

does." If this is the logic of the typical investor, then he is acting
irrationally; it is not possible for everyone to get out before everyone

else. But so far we have not presented any evidence that the actual spot
process behaves differently from investors' expectations. We consider such
evidence in the following section.1°

IV. Rationality of the Survey Expectations
Now that we have a sense for the behavior of the survey expected
depreciation, we turn to an analysis of whether the predictable component

100ne possibility is that the MMS short—term survey is picking up
predominantly the expectations of floor traders, people who buy and sell
currency on a short—term basis, and that the other two, longer—term,
surveys are picking up predominantly the expectations of investors who have
a longer—term perspective. Under this interpretation, it may be that the
traders have developed the habit of ignoring economic fundamentals in their
expectations formation, rather going with time series trends (as in
"chartism" or "technical analysis"), and that the latter group pays more
attention to fundaiaentals. The chartist/fundamentalist dichotomy and its
implications for the determination of the value of the dollar in the 1980s
are pursued in Frankel and Froot (1986).

of

the true spot process behaves in the same way, i.e., whether

expectations are rational. One way to proceed would be to re—estimate each
of the models given in equations (5)—(8), only now using realized

depreciation as the lefthand—side variable. The hypothesis that
expectations are rational would imply that these regressions should yield
coefficients that are statistically indistinguishable from those obtained

earlier using the surveys on the lefthand aide. A more direct way to test
the same hypothesis is to regress the difference between the survey
expectation and the actual future spot rate, the survey prediction error,

on each set of regressors in equations (5)-(3). Under the null hypfthesis
that expectations are rational, this prediction error should be purely
random (conditionally independent of all information available at time t)
and therefore should be uncorrelated both with the righthand—side variables

and with past errors. We test whether the coefficients are jointly zero.
Table 7 reports regressions of the survey prediction errors on

the most recent change in the spot rate. The estimated F statistics give
some evidence of systematic expectational errors: five of the nine data
sets reject the joint hypothesis that both the constant and slope

coefficients equal zero. In view of the discussion in the previous
section, an inspection of the slope coefficient, g, can help us to
determine whether investors place the correct weight on the lagged spot

rate. A finding of g1>O would indicate that expectations are
"insufficiently" extrapolative: investors give too much weight to the
lagged spot rate and too little weight to the contemporaneous spot rate

relative to what is rational. Conversely, a finding of g,<O would indicate

that expectations are "overly" extrapolative. Table 7
predictions

suggests

that

at the shorter forecast horizons tend to be overly

extrapolative,

while those at the longer horizoha are insufficiently

extrapolative. Such a pattern suggests that the contrast in Table 5
between the behavior of short—term and long—term expectations is too

relative to what the actual process generating spot rate changes
would predict. Few estimates of Zi' however, are significantly different
extreme

from zero. There is thus not enough evidence so far to conclude that, at
any of the reported forecast horizons, investors place too little or too
much weight on the lagged spot rate relative to what is rational.
In Table 8 we test whether investors' expectations give the

correct weight to the long—run equilibrium spot rate1 L Here the
results

are surprisingly consistent across all of the forecast horizons:

expectations seem to be insufficiently regressive in that they give less
weight to §,

and

therefore more weight to the contemporaneous spot rate,

than does the true process governing the behavior of the spot rate. In
Table 9 we perform

the analogous test using lagged expectational errors on

the righthand side. In this case, the alternative hypotheses are that
expectations are either overly or insufficiently adaptive. As in Table 7,
the results in Table 9 do not suggest any clear tendency on the part of
investors to give too much or too little weitlt to the most recent
expectational prediction error.

The tests of rational expectations presented so far in Tables
7—9 are appropriate when we take as given the specific models of

expectations

formation discussed in the previous section. Each regression

— 21 —
was designed to test whether investors assign the correct weit to a

single element in their information set when predicting the level of the

yen/dollar rate. If, however, both expectations and the

true spot

process

depend on other unspecified infornation, then the above tests of
rationality are not necessarily the most enlightening nor the most powerful.
A more robust test would ask whether expectations assign too little weight
to the contemporaneous spot rate and (by default) too much weight to all

other variables in their information set. This test is performed by
regressing the survey prediction error on the survey expected depreciation:

(10)

:+k—

5tk a + b t+k —

s) + ttk'

-

and testing the hypothesis that the coefficients are jointly zero. The
alternative hypothesis is that investors place too much (or too little)
weight on variables other than the contemporaneous spot rate relative to

what is rational. Following Bilson (1981), we term this alternative
hypothesis "excessive speculation", because investors could improve their
forecasts by consistently reducing toward zero their expectations of
depreciation.

Table 10 reports our estimates of equation (10). Here we find
much more evidence of systematic expectational errors in the surveys. All
but one

of the data sets reject the hypothesis that

statistically different from zero, so there is considerable evidence of

rationality,

our estimates here are uniformly positive and do not appear

related to the length of forecast horizon. In every case we are also
unable to reject the hypothesis that b—i, which would imply that the

expectations contain no useful information at all as to the future spot
rate, i.e., that the spot rate follows a random walk.
-

We

mentioned earlier the possibility of measurement error in the

survey data. In any of the regression equations where the expectations
variable appears only on the lefthand side, namely the cases of
extrapolative expectations (Tables 14 and 7) and regressive expecations

(Tables 5 and 8) random measurement error does not impair the regression

estimates. But in the case of adaptive expectations (Tables ô and 9). as
well as in the present case of excessive speculation (Table 10), the
expectations variable appears also on the righthand side of the equation,
so that measurement error would affect the estimates.

When the issue of possible random measurement error in these
regression equations is addressed the results are qualitatively unchanged.
In the test for excessive speculation we can eliminate the problem of
measurement error (so long as it is random) by using the forward discount

as the righthand—side variable. Table 11 again shows systematic
expectational errors: investors could do better by routinely betting
against the forward discount,11

11See Froot and Frankel (1986) for further explanation. In the case of
estimating adaptive expectations, we would argue that the bias introduced,
though nonzero, is small, because the variance of actual spot rate changes
is approximately 10 times larger than the variance of expected depreciation
(Table 3, ibid.).

Conclusions

(1) The survey data on exchange rate expectations appear to contain new
information about market expectations which is not apparent from either ex

post spot rate changes or the forward discount. Our measures show that,
despite the large swings in both directions in the value of the yen since
1980, the surveys consistently called for a large appreciation of the yen
against the dollar.

(2) These measures of expected appreciation are also substantially in
excess of the forward pre!tiu.'n.

An implication is that investors were

wiiitg to accept a lower expected rate of return on dollar assets than on
comparable asseta denominated in yen.

(3)

Contrary

to what is commonly assumed in most models in which

Sterilized foreign exchange intervention is efrective, variation in the
forward discowfl does not reflect a

statistically significant degree of

variation in the risk premium.

(14) Variation in the forward disc6unt

primarily reflects, instead of

changes in the risk premiwn, changes in expected depreciation.

(5) The expectations given in the short—tern surveys exhibit bandwagon
effects, which could imply that short—term speculation is destabilizing.

(6) Expectations at longer—term horizcns, in ccntrast, appear to put less
than full weight on the contemporaneous spc: r: and positive weight on

24 —

several

other variables such as the lagged spot rate, the long—run

equilibrium spot rate, and the lagged expected spot rate.

(7) Investors could improve both their short—term and their long—term
forecasts by reducing the absolute magnitude of expected depreciation

toward zero. This finding of "excessive speculation" would also follow
from the result that expected depreciation is not zero together with the
popular hypothesis that the true spot process follows a random walk.
