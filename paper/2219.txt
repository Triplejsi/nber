Discounting Rules for Risky Assets

ABSTRACT

This paper develops a rule for calculating a discount rate to value

risky projects. The rule assumes that asset risk can be measured by a

(e.g., beta), but makes no other assumptions
of the asset pricing model. It treats all projects

single index

about specific

forms

as combinations of

two assets: Treasury bills and the market portfolio. We know how to value
each of these assets under any theory of debt and taxes and under any

assumption about the slope and intercept of the market line forequity
securities. Our discount rate is a weighted average of the after-tax return
on riskless debt and the expected return on the portfolio, where the weight
on the market portfolio is beta.

DISCOUNTING RULES FOR RISKY ASSETS

Stewart C. Myers and Richard S. Ruback*

I. INTRODUCTION
We still do not understand the role 6f taxes in determining optimal

capital structure, if there is an optimal capital structure. Therefore, we
have no general rule for calculating discount rates for capital investments

which are partly debt-financed. The only bulletproof rules apply to two
special cases. First, we know that risk-free, after-corporate-tax nominal
cash flows should be discounted at the after-corporate-tax risk free

interest rate. Second, we know that projects that exactly duplicate the
firm's existing assets, both in risk and financing, are correctly valued by
discounting at the firm's weighted average cost of capital.
The discounting rules for these two special cases work regardless of

"right" theory of debt and taxes. For example, Ruback (1986) shows that the
discount rate for risk-free flows can be derived as a special case of the
adjusted discount rate formula derived by Modigliani and Miller (Ff1) in 1963

and also as a special case of Myers's adjusted present value method (1974),

which as originally presented adopted

assumptions about the value of

corporate interest tax shields. But th- same discounting rule also follows
from Miller's 1977 "Deb and Taxes" paper, because in that model the
opportunity cost of equity investment ir a risk-free asset is the after_tax

risk-free rate. Ruback proves these di unting rules by arguing that any

stream of risk-free future cash inflows can be "zeroed out" by a borrowing
plan under which after-tax debt service is matched to the penny to the cash

inflows. (Cash outflows can be zeroed out by a matched lending plan.)
Since debt service can be covered exactly, the initial amount borrowed under
the plan carr'be money in the bank at "time zero," which needless to say is -

not

difficult to value.'
We set out to find a discounting rule which could be used to value any

risky cash flow stream. We failed. But we did find a rule which guarantees
a project value under any equilibrium theory of debt and taxes, so long as
the corporation adheres to a specific financing policy for the project.

We do not claim that this financing policy is optimal, only that it is

feasible. If there is a different optimal policy, and if the manager knows
what that Dolicy is, project value can exceed our guaranteed value. For
managers who share our ignorance of optimal capital structure, however, the
guaranteed value should be helpful as a lower bound.

Our discounting rule does not require exotic ingredients --

only

the

risk—free interest rate, the marginal corporate tax rate, a risk measure or
measures for the stream, arid the expected rate of return on a reference

portfolio of traded securities. If a one-factor capital asset pricing model
is assume-I, as we do for convenience in most of this paper, then the risk

measure is the asset beta and the reference portfolio is the market.

where rf(l-TC) is the nominal Treasury rate, after taxes at the marginal

corporate rate, T, rm is the expected rate of return on the market, and
is .the "asset beta" of the cash flow. The asset beta is the beta of a
direct equity claim on the cash flow, that is, the beta the cash flow would

have if it were traded as an all-equity finance.mini-firm. Weassume this.
beta is known.

The intuition behind this cost of capital rule is straightforward. The
right cost of capital for a risky project is its opportunity cost, which is
the expected rate of return on a capital market investment with identical

risk. A firm

could

use investments in T-bills and the market portfolio to

form a replicating portfolio with the same risk as the project. The
replicating portfolio is constructed by investing l- percent of its funds
in the T-bills, with an after-corporate-tax return of rf(l-TC), and

investing B

percent

of its funds in the market, with an expected return of

rm. (This replicating strategy assumes that a corporation does not pay
taxes on its investment in the market portfolio.) The replicating portfolio
has the same beta as the risky project and provides an after-corporate tax

return of r*. The after-tax opportunity cost of investing in the risky
project is therefore given by equation (1), and that rate, r*, should be
used to value the project.

Our discount rate rule can also be interpreted as a weighted average
cost of capital for a project:

WACC =

rD (1-T)

+

rE

(2)

This project weighted average cost of capital can be usd to valie a project
as long as the debt and equity rates of return and weights are for the

4

project. Our rule simply assigns specific values to the components of WACC:
the debt ratio, DIV. is set equal to 1—a; the equity ratio, Ely, is set

equal to .

With these weights, if the debt is riskiess (so that

the equity has a beta of one and rE =

rd =

rf).

rm.

The next section presents the discounting rule, proves it gives a
guaranteed value, and discusses. practical application and underlying
assumptions.

II. A DISCOUNTING RULE FOR RISKY CASH FLOWS.

-

The discount rate we propose is a weighted average of the aftercorporate

tax risk—free interest rate and the expected rate of return on a

reference

portfolio of risky securities. The weight on

portfolio's

the reference

return is the cash flow's risk relative to the reference

portfolio.

The only requirement for the reference portfolio is that it can be
levered or unlevered to match its risk level to the risk of the cash flows.
Under the capital asset pricing model, or any single-factor model, the
natural reference portfolio is the market portfolio, and the risk measure is

beta. The beta of an equity investment in a cash flow can always be made
equal to one, the market beta, by levering or unlevering.

For now we take

the market as the reference portfolio. But it is important to emphasize
that the only aspect of the Capital Asset Pricing Model that we depend on is

that beta is the correct measure of r3k.

We

We also assume that the firm has sufficient taxable income, either

from the cash flow being valued or from other corporate assets, that it can

always use interest tax shields immediately when interest is paid. We
assume that it could borrow (l-) of the cash flow's value over any short

period at the risk-free interest rate. I!

exceeds one, this amounts to

lending (-l) times the cash flow's value at the risk-free rate.
Finally, we assume that capital markets are complete enough to support

value additivity. We ignore transaction costs or other market
imperfections.
-Consider an' asset generating a single cash- flow X, with expectation X =

E(X), to be received next period. X is net of corporate taxes. However,
these taxes do not reflect any interest tax shields on debt associated with,

or supported by X. In other words, the corporate tax paid on X is
calculated assuming all-equity financing.
We will now give two proofs that discounting X at r* gives a lower

bound to its market value. The first proof is quick and simple. The second
is longer but more informative.

First Proof
We calculate V, the market value of X, as if the asset generating

X were traded as a separately financed mini-firm. Given value additivity, V
is also the project's contribution to its parent firm's value. We can think
of adding the mini-firm's value to the left-hand side of the parent's
balance sheet and it's debt and equity values to the right-hand side of the

parent's balanc sheet.
Suppose the firm"finances" the projfct with D =

debt. That is, it accepts D =

(1-)V

(1-)V

dollars of

a :.s capital structure policy for

the asset generating X. The mini-firm's initial market value balance sheet

6

is:

V = V(x,D)

D =

(1-6)v

E =
V

V

Note that V may depend on debt policy. We do not assume that borrowing
(1—)V is the best policy, only that it is a feasible policy.

We do assume,

provisionally, that the beta of V(XD) does not depend on D.2
The beta of the equity claim on X is one. Since the beta of the
portfolio of D and E equals the asset beta, and since

Rearranging (2), and substituting the values for the project's debt ((1-)V)
and equity (By), proves that:

BE

B(1+

Thus rE, the expected rate of return investors would demand on the equity,
equals rm, the expected rate—of return on the reference (market) portfolio.
The expected portfolio rate of return on the debt and equity claims on
X is weighted average of rf? the risk-free-rate, and rm. the expected equity

return. The weights are the financing proportions DIV and Ely. This return
comes as a cash payout, which in total is the cash flow X plus the interes

tax shield TCrfD. The expected return per dollar invested is therefore

In application, equation (4) is the starting point, not the end result. The
firm forecasts X, discounts it at r* to obtain V. and then issues debt of

plus the residual equity claim on X) is in fact V under the assumed

financing policy.

personal tax rates are riot equal, the after personal tax rates on safe debt

and safe equity3 must be the same:

rfe (

(lTpd).

Thus in Miller's (1977) model, where Tpe= 0 and the marginal investor's Tpd

equals the corporale rate, rfe= rf (1-T).
We do not know rf1 re or the personal tax rates of the relevant

marginal investors. We assume the firm knows rf and rm, but not the
intercept or slope of the security market line because rfe is unknown:

Figure 1 shows three possible lines: first, the "Iffi" line with rfC =

rf.

which is the same as the original capital asset pricing model's line;

second, the "Miller line" with Tpe = 0 and rfe

rf(l-TC); and finally an

intermediate. case. Obviously the expected return depends on the line
assumed, unless it happens that 6

= 1.

For illustration we have marked

The MM line implies a strong tax advantage to corporate borrowing, the
intermediate line a weaker advantage, and the Miller line no advantage at

all. We do not know which line is right. But the value of a future cash
flow does

depend on the line so long as the firm

to the d'bt

policy underlying our discounting rule.

for an all equity claim to the cash flow; and T*rf (l-)APV is the net
interest tax shield when personal as well as orporate taxes are considered.
We continue our provisional assumption that interest tax shields are just as
risky as the cash flow X, and thus discount both terms in equation (7) at r.

When the firm

switches

debt for equity, and pays.an additional dollar

of interest, the corporate tax shield is T, or Tc(lTpe) after equity
investors' taxes. At the same time the switch subjects one dollar of
investment income to tax at Tpd rather than

Table 1 shows that exactly the same APV is obtained under three
different assumptions about debt and taxes and the security market line.
The calculations in Table 1 clarify why our discounting rule works

under any equilibrium model of debt and taxes. If we move from Case 1 (MM)
to Case 2 (Miller), the cash flow X loses value because T* drops from .50 to

zero. But it also gains value because r, the all-equity opportunity cost of
capital, falls from .15

to

.125. The loss and gain exactly offset. Given

rf. rm and T, and given our proposed financing policy, calculated value can
never be increased by assuming a higher value for T* because a consistent
assumption about the security market line requires increasing r to offset
the tax gain.5

This is not a standard comparative sttic analysis of the marginal

properties of an equilibrium. Instead we st ith the observed rates, rf
and rm, which could be generated by any of a
e number of equilibria. We
then ask whether project value depends on what

:e true equilibrium is.

The table also shows why our proposed rule may understate the cash
flow's actual value.- Its value could be increased in cases 1 and 3 by
-

borrowing more than 50 percent of its value. In general our discounting
-rule will understate value j there- are significant tax advantages to

corporate debt (T*>O), j agency, moral hazard, or bankruptcy costs do not

prevent borrowing more than (1-)V, and j managers act to lever up beyond
(1-)V. However, our_rule guarantees a project value to a manager who is
uncertain about "debt and taxes," who worries about the cost of financial

distress which may be encountered at debt levels above (1-)V, or who has
trouble convincing a conservative organization to lever up aggressively.

A Qualification
So far we have assumed that the risk of the total cash payout to debt

and equity combined does not depend on the debt amount. This is not always
right, because the corporate interest tax shield TCrfD is a safe nominal

flow, received when interest is paid next period. The overall beta of debt
and equity is thus reduced by borrowing whenever interest tax shields

contribute to firm value. If they do not contribute, the overail beta is
unchanged by borrowing despite the addition of the safe interest tax
shields.

Consider the beta of investing in the total cash payout to debt and

equity investors. It depends on the covariance of the return on this
investment with the market return, r ,
m

that

jS:

COV[(X + rfTD)/V rm] = COV(X, r)/V.

The safe tax shield 7fTCD affects this covariance only as it affects V.

,

14

In an MM would, as D increases, V increases and the covariance and beta

fall. In a Miller equilibrium, V does not depend on D, and the
covariance and beta are therefore constant too.
If Miller is right., our discountingrule (Eq. 11) gives exactly the
right answer given the financing policy of D =

(1-)V.

But if MM are right,

our rule understates project value, because the equity beta is less than one

when D =

(1-)v.

If we knew that MM were right, this problem would be fixed by slightly

modifying the assumed financing policy to put more weight on rf(lTc), the
after-tax risk free rate, and less on rm, the expected market return. We now
work through the modification to see how much difference this modification
might make.

Safe nominal flows are valued by discounting at the after-tax risk free

rate. Thus the interest tax shield's present value is:

TCrfD

=

yD

(9)

l+rf(lT)

Suppose the firm "cashes in" this present value by borrowing an additional
amount yD, generating this market value balance sheet:

16

The adjustment of weights in equation (10) is probably not an important

practical refinement. For example, under the ssumptions of Table 1, the
weight on the after-tax risk free rate would change from 1- =

The discount rate changes from r* = .125 in Table 1 to:

r* = .512 (.10)(1-.5) +

.488(.20)

=

.123.

Thus our discounting rule, Eg. (1), is not entirely insulated from the

debate about taxes and optimal capital structure. The rule will overstate
the correct discount rate when there is a tax advantage to corporate

borrowing. We believe the overstatement is minor - note that an estimate of
rm could easily be a full percentage point off target. Of course a manager
who believed that there is a tax advantage to corporate borrowing would

calculate r* by equation (10), taking the chance of using adiscount rate
that is slightly too low.

single index (e.g., beta), but makes no other assumptions about specific

form of the asset pricing model. The rule works for all equilibrium
theories of debt and taxes. The rule works because it treats all projects

as combinations of twoassets: Treasury bills and the market portfolio. We
know how to 'value each of these assets under any theory of debt and taxes

and under any assumption about the slope and intercept of the market line
for equity securities.

Given the corporate tax rate, the interest rate on Treasury bills, and
the expected rate of return on the market, we can calculate the cost of

capital for a feasible financing strategy. The firm finances the project

The r* used in equation (11) could come either from equation '1) or
equation (10). Using the latter treats each period's interest tax sn1d as
a safe, nominal flow to be received at the end of that period. However,
interest tax shields in subsecuent periods are not know, since debt le:els
will be adjusted to cx post changes in the cash flow's market value. F
example, the firm at t-2 would view the interest tax shield TCrfD_, as a
safe nominal flow to be received at t-1. But the interest tax shield tc be
received at t is, when viewed from t-2, a random variable proportional t
V_1, that is TCrfWflV_l. The beta of a claim on this final tax shield
held from t-2 to t-I is the same as the beta of an unlevered claim on
X. The value of this-claim

with equity and debt in the proportions

and (l-). Value increasing

projects could be completely financed using this strategy. The weighted
average cost of financing this project provides a discount rate that values
the project correctly.

Of course, otherfinancing strategies are possible. If the firm knew
the correct theory of debt and taxes, it could probably come up with a
financing strategy that resulted in a lower cóst of capital than our rule

provides. Conversely, a different strategy could be worse than our rule,

and result in a higher cost of capital. Our contribution is to provide a
method for valuing risky projects that works for a variety of different
theories of debt and taxes and involves a financing strategy that is

feasible. We can guarantee a project value not withstanding our ignorance
about optimal capital structure.
