The Financial Impact of Social Security by Cohort
Under Alternative Financing Assumptions

ABSTRACT
This paper analyses the financial impact of Social Security by age
cohort under alternative assumptions concerning future financing of Social
Security. It examines the Social Security Administration's intermediate
tIE and various combinations of optimistic and pessimistic assumptions
concerning fertility, mortality, and wage growth. Importantly, it examines
the implications of alternative potential resolutions of the long-term
financing deficit and scenarios concerning the planned systematic deviation
from pay-as-you-go finance in the retirement and disability funds.
The results suggest that the Social Security retirement program offers
vastly different returns to households in different circumstances, and
especially to different cohorts. Most important, if Social Security does
not maintain the large retirement trust fund surplus currently projected
for the next 30 years, alternative scenarios for return to pay-as-you-go
finance differ dramatically in the taxes, benefits, transfers, and real
rates of return that can be offered to different birth cohorts. The
implications of cutting taxes, raising benefits or diverting the surplus to
other purposes have dramatic impact on the overall financial status of the
system, the time pattern of taxes, benefits and surpluses or deficits, and
therefore, the treatment of different age cohorts.
Under the intermediate assumptions, the OASDI surplus is projected to
grow almost as large as a fraction of CNP as the current ratio of privately
held national debt to GNP. For example, if the OASDI surplus is used to
raise benefits, and they remained at higher levels thereafter during the
height of the baby-boom generation's retirement, the long-run actuarial
deficit will zoom from $500 billion to over $3 trillion. Correspondingly,
if benefits increase, financed by the OASDI surplus over the next 30 years,
the expected rate of return on lifetime contributions increases for those
currently about 40 years old from 1.9% to 2.7%, about a 40% increase.
Correspondingly, if the surplus is dissipated and the subsequent long-run
deficit is made up with a tax increase on a pay-as-you-go basis at the time
of the projected deficit, the rate of return relative to the intermediate
assumptions for those persons now being born will fall by about 15%, and in
this case, the overall system finances would move from a long-run actuarial
deficit of slightly under one-half percent of taxable payroll to actuarial
balance -

Thus, as Social Security is projected to deviate systematically from
pay-as-you-go finance, the potential alternative scenarios with respect to
accruing the surplus and/or dissipating it in various ways have potentially
large intergenerational redistribution effects.

Introduction

1.

For most Americans, anticipated Social Security retirement benefits
have a value larger than the total value of their other financial

assets)- Likewise, more than half of the workers in the United
States pay more in Old Age, Survivors, Disability, and Hospital
Insurance (OASDHI) "contributions" than they pay in personal income

taxes. Because the program looms so large in the financial picture of
so many, it is reasonable to assume that there is a significant demand
for an investment evaluation of the "deal" it offers citizens.

However,

the program is extremely complex, with the expected benefits depending
on one's marital status, sex, age-earnings profile, length of career,
number of children, and other factors.

In this paper we simplify the analysis by exclusively evaluating

the retirement portion of the program. We examine it from the
perspectives of the individual household, entire cohorts and aggregate

system finances. Our study is partial equilibrium in the sense that we
do not tackle the consequences of the program for labor force

participation, private saving behavior or funding the federal debt. We
compute present values of taxes and benefits using a two percent real
discount rate.2 We also calculate what individuals receive from Social
Security as transfers -

the difference between the present values of

1. This value may very well be enhanced by the fact that the benefits are
paid out as an inflation adjusted life annuity.
2. See Boskin, icotlikoff, Puffert and Shoven (1987) for a discussion of the
choice of discount rate and sensitivity analyses.

benefits and taxes. One's transfer is thus the surplus or gain one
receives from participating in the system (if the figure is positive).
Finally, we compute the internal rate of return offered by the

retirement portion of Social Security. That is, we calculate the rate
of discount which equates the expected present value of benefits with

the expected present value of taxes. Throughout the analysis, we assume
the participant bears the burden or effectively pays both the employer
and the employee contributions to the system.

The long-run financial status of Social Security is quite

uncertain. First, future economic and demographic trends heavily affect
revenues and outlays. Second, except under the Social Security
Administration's optimistic scenario, the retirement part of the system

is projected to be in long-run actuarial deficit: small under the
intermediate assumptions; large under the pessimistic ones.

Hospital

Insurance (HI) is projected to run a large deficit beginning in the

l990s. Finally, the OASDI system is projected to accrue (under the
intermediate assumptions) a very large surplus over the next thirty

years. This surplus is projected to cumulate to almost 30% of CNP,

close to the current size of the national debt to CNP ratio. This
surplus is "designed" to reduce the need for still larger tax increases
or benefit reductions during the baby boom generation's retirement.
Figure 1 presents estimates of these average annual (not cumulative)
surpluses and deficits in Social Security, including and excluding HI
over the next 75 years to highlight this projected movement away from
pay-as -you-go finance.

We have never been able to accrue a surplus this large in Social

Security; the retirement surplus may well be dissipated for other
purposes (to bail out HI, fund other programs, raise benefits, cut

2

taxes, etc.) These possibilities involve major inter-cohort transfers
relative to the intermediate assumptions, as do, of course, the
alternative methods of dealing with the long-run deficit (see Boskin

(1986)). We analyze these in detail below.
The emphasis of the paper is to calculate the financial terms of
Social Security's Old Age and Survivors Insurance for households from
different birth cohorts under alternative possible futures. Our results
-

indicate

that the "deal" varies substantially by cohort and that

trillions of (real discounted) dollars are at stake for difference
cohorts both in the economic and demographic future of the United States
and in the use of the projected temporary surplus in the OASI trust
fund.

The remainder of the paper is as follows: the next section
contains a brief survey of related literature. Section 3 describes our
methodology and data. Section 4 presents results using intermediate
assumptions for the overall financial status of the system, the
situation to be faced by successive ten year birth cohorts (from before
1912 through 1992) and that facing middle income single-earner families

born in each of four years: 1945, 1960, 1975 and 1990. Section 5
analyzes the effects of alternative future economic and demographic

patterns. In addition to the standard optimistic and pessimistic Social
Security Administration packages, we also present marginal changes for

fertility, mortality and real wage growth. Section 6 estimates the
implications of alternative uses of the large surplus which is projected

to accrue in OASI's trust fund: what difference it makes, in the
aggregate and to specific cohorts if the surplus is used to raise
benefits or reduce taxes, or is spent on other programs.

Section 7 presents a brief conclusion which offers a short summary
and repeats some caveats concerning interpretation of the results.
The Appendix presents tables which provide detailed data on the
taxes, benefits, transfers and rates of return by cohort and to a
"typical" family for the alternative scenarios considered.

2.

Literature Review

Several studies analyze the long-run financial solvency of Social

Security under alternative economic and demographic assumptions. The
most important, of course, are the annual Social Security trustees'
reports (formally, the Annual Reports of the Board of Trustees of the
Old Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust Funds).

They present both short- and long-term actuarial projections of Social

Security trust fund finances under alternative assumptions. The reports
certainly have valuable information, but these data are presented only
as fractions of taxable payroll (except, in one table, as fractions of
GNP); dollar figures (whether discounted or not) are not presented for

long-term projections. More importantly, the reports do not in fact
consider what the state of the retirement (OASI) trust fund might be at

the end of the report's 75 year horizon. Rather it presents the simple
average. over 75 years, of each year's surplus or deficit (that is, tax
receipts minus benefit payments) as a fraction of that year's taxable

payroll. The calculation considers neither the increase over time in
taxable payroll nor the interest earned on the cumulated trust fund

surplus. Thus, the 1986 report's claim that the OASI trust fund is in
"close actuarial balance" because the average annual deficit is only
0.29 percent of taxable payroll is based on a fundamental

4

misunderstanding of what that figure means. The report presents no
sufficient basis for evaluating the long-run financial solvency of Old

Age and Survivors Insurance.3
Boskin's (1986) estimates of the long-run financial solvency of
OASI avoids these inadequacies by considering annual flows of dollars
and by projecting the actual accumulation and decumulation of the OASI

trust fund. He also considers what will happen if the expected
cumulative surplus of the next three decades is dissipated (for example,
by raising benefits) or if reforms are instituted in retirement age and
other features.

Several studies have attempted to estimate the "deal" various
households. have received or can expect to receive from Social Security's

retirement program. The general conclusion is that the early cohorts of
retirees had very large rates of return on their taxes and that future
retirees, especially well-off ones, are likely to fare poorly, with a

rate of return below that available on private assets. Hurd and Shoven
(1985) document this pattern of rates of return for various cohorts and
earnings levels, but their analysis was made prior to the 1983
amendments and hence does not include consideration of the increased age
of eligibility for future retirees or the partial taxation of benefits.

3. In fact, if the report were to present the correct calculation, based on
the report's own assumptions and methodology, the resulting figures
would be more optimistic under each of the four sets of assumptions
used. A comparison of Tables 10 and F2 in the 1986 report shows that
taxable payroll is projected to rise at a rate slightly below the
assumed interest rate (under each alternative set of assumptions). This
means that the earlier positive annual balances should be given greater
weight than the later negative annual balances. Thus the long-run
actuarial balance should be reported as a little higher.

5

Boskin, Avrin and Cone (1983) report the transfer both for
aggregate ten year age cohort and for average households in each cohort.
They also present estimates of how different cohorts and the system
finances as a whole would be affected by various policy changes, such as

increases in the retirement age. They conclude that those retiring
recently are receiving benefits which are about three times as large as
the sum of their employee and employer contributions plus three percent
real interest, i.e. ,

about two-thirds of their benefits are transfers.

These results are updated to take account of the 1983 amendments in

Boskin (1986). The pattern of transfers remains qualitatively similar
to that mentioned above) but attention is called to the fact that OASDI
is unlikely to be financially solvent over the next 75 years, despite

the 1983 amendments. The financial solvency issue is much worse if HI

is included. Boskin emphasizes how and when the financial solvency
issue is addressed -

whether changes occur in the tax rates, benefit

formulae, the age of eligibility for full retirement benefits, or the
method of financing Social Security.

Pellechio and Coodfellow (1983) examine the net impact of the 1983

amendments on various types of households. Our own analysis of typical
households is similar in spirit to theirs.

Boskin, Kotlikoff, Puffert and Shoven (1987) present estimates,
ignoring long-run funding issues, for alternative family types and birth

cohorts. They conclude that the deal offered by Social Security varies
substantially, and has not always been better for poorer persons. The
transfers vary by (real discounted) $200,000 per family, amounts which
dwarf the redistributions debated in alternative income tax reforms.
They also note that the marginal linkage between taxes paid and benefits
received is quite low (often zero) and thus Social Security ought to be

6

viewed as a tax with the concommitant distortions (e.g. ,

in

the labor

market). They also note that considering previously paid taxes a sunk
cost creates a situation in which all but very young workers expect to
receive back more in benefits than they expect to pay in taxes for the
remainder of their work life; thus most people have a stake in
preserving the Social Security system, even though their lifetime
transfers are negative.

Finally, Bernheim (1986) notes an inconsistency in actuarial
discounting and maintaining the strong form of the life-cycle hypothesis

(an average propensity to consume over the lifetime of one). He argues
that simple discounting may be a good approximation for such

individuals. Since there is considerable evidence that many individuals
refuse annuities (e.g., TIA participants are well known to opt for a
certain pension of fixed duration rather than an annuity), and numerous
other studies suggest that lifecycle behavior cannot explain all --

perhaps most --

saving,

or

the applicability of this to the current paper

is questionable. Certainly, the population is heterogeneous, and for

some, perhaps simple discounting is appropriate. We discuss these
issues in the caveats in the conclusion.

3. Methodology and Data
The results which we present here are based on computer simulations
of present and future American families covered by the Social Security

system. Our main simulation package derives aggregate discounted
figures for the taxes paid and benefits received by each of nine
successive decadal birth cohorts (a cohort is, for example, all those
born from 1943 to 1952). It simultaneously derives figures for annual

7

income to and expenditure from the Social Security Administration's
retirement (that is, OASI) trust fund over the next 75 years.4
This simulation begins with earnings records and other data

concerning Social Security participants who were surveyed in l973.
For subsequent years we estimate participants' earnings based on
demographic characteristics, we derive benefits based on legislated
benefit formulas, and we determine each participant's year of death
through a random process based on mortality tables published by the
Social Security Administration.6

Cohorts born beginning in 1953 are simulated differently. In
considering typical male and female wage earners born each year, we
derive their expected tax and benefit futures based on mortality

probabilities and the proportion that can be expected to marry. We
multiply by the number born each year (plus the number born that year
who later immigrate as children) who will enter covered employment and

thus derive figures for entire cohorts. To derive income and
expenditure for the trust fund as a whole we make a further adjustment
for taxes paid and benefits received by adult immigrants; the totals for
cohorts, however, considers only those covered their entire lives.7

4. For further information on this simulation, or rather on an earlier
version of it, see Boskin, Avrin, and Cone. (1983)
5. The 1975 Social Security Exact Match File merged individual records from
the 1973 Current Population Survey with records of covered earnings.
6. Social Security Administration, Actuarial Study No. 92 (1984).

7. It will be noted that our simulation shows the 1943-1952 cohort faring
rather worse than its successor, although the general pattern is that
succeeding cohorts until about 1960 do progressively worse. The reason
for this is that this cohort is the youngest one for which survey data
are used, and many in this cohort are not yet married. It is well known
that singles fare rather poorly under Social Security, since they have
no option to receive a spouse or survivor benefit rather than a benefit

8

The discussion is based on a version of our simulation which
assumes the tax law effective at the time of the Trustees' Report.

Results presented below use the recently enacted income-tax law. Thus,
we project small annual deficits for the trust fund in 1986 and 1987,

while the trust fund is actually now running a small surplus.8
Our simulation goes beyond that of the Social Security
Administration in highlighting not only the financial evolution of the
trust fund but also the impact on successive cohorts of Old Age and
Survivors Insurance, both as currently legislated and as it may have to
be changed in the future in order to maintain the solvency of the trust
fund.

A second simulation9 looks at the financial impact of Old Age

and Survivors Insurance for a variety of typical families. We use this
simulation to derive the expected value (in an ex-ante calculation which
recognizes the possiblity of death at any age) of a household's social

based on their own

earnings.

8. Our calculation is certainly rougher than that undertaken by the
actuarial staff of the Social Security Administration. As a result, we
generate projections of aggregate taxes and benefits which vary from
those of the 1986 Trustee's Report. Between now and 2010 we dervive
less in annual and cumulative surpluses (due to deriving less in tax
receipts) than what the Trustees' Report suggests is likely. Our
figures are close to those of the Trustee's Report in the early 2O1O's
but thereafter until about 2040 we derive greater annual surpluses or
lower deficits than those projected in the Trustee's Report. After 2040
we again generate higher annual deficits.

9. More extensive results from this simulation, but based on the income tax
law in effect until 1986, are presented in Boskin, Kotlikoff, Puffert
and Shoven (1987) and Boskin and Puffert (1987). The former article
also contains a more extensive description of our methodology.

security taxes and benefits, and thus its net transfer and real rate of
return.

In the main simulation we rely on Social Security Administration
projections for the proportion of Social Security benefits which are

recovered for the trust fund through income taxation. These estimates
are that this proportion will rise from less than two percent in 1986 to

about five percent in the mid-twenty-first century. Because legislated
marginal tax rates have been reduced since the Social Security
Administration made its projections we assume that, from 1988 on, 20

percent less will be collected in taxes on benefits. In 1987, the
transition year, we assume that 10 percent less will be collected.

In the second simulation we calculate income taxation for each
case, based on the new tax law and data from the Internal Revenue

Service about taxable income of the elderlyJ0
Both of these simulations are parameterized by economic,

demographic, and legal assumptions. The most important economic
assumption is future growth of real wages. The chief demographic
assumptions are mortality probabilities by age and fertility rates. The
legal assumptions are tax rates on payroll and formulae for the

calculation of benefits. In the scenarios below we consider the
alternative economic and demographic assumptions that the Social
Security Administration itself uses for the scenarios in its annual
trustees' reports11, and we consider fixed multiples of the payroll taxes

10. For details, see Boskin, Kottlikof, Puffert and Shoven (1987).

11. We do not consider alternative assumptions for unemployment, female
labor force participation, immigration or real interest rates.

10

and the benefits currently legislated.

The present values which we derive assume a real discount rate of

two percent. This is the rate which the Social Security Administration
assumes (in its intermediate assumption) will be realized on its trust

fund. We apply this rate not only to the system's finances, however,

but also to participants in Social Security. A subsequent section will
discuss arguments that this rate is either too low or too high when

applied to individualsj2 but we note here one advantage of this figure.
When participants can expect a higher rate of return from Social
Security than that received by the trust fund, it must be the case that
their participation raises the trust fund's unfunded liabilities by the

excess of claims on the trust fund over assets. The amount of a
cohort's net transfer (discounted benefits minus discounted taxes) is
the amount by which the trust fund's unfunded liabilities rise.
Conversely, a cohort real rate of return below two percent Indicates a
decrease in the trust fund's unfunded liabilities.

4.

Results for Intermediate Assumptions

Table 1 presents the results of our main simulation using the
Trustees' Report's intermediate assumptions about future economic and

demographic trends. Panel A shows the basic trends, well known by now,
that are expected to develop in the finances of the OASI trust fund.

12. In previous work (Boskin, Kotlikoff, Puffert and Shoven (1987)) we and
our colleagues argue for a rate of three percent.

11

The trust fund will run a substantial surplus over the next 25 years
while the baby-boom generation is in its peak earnings years. In the
following 25 years (more precisely, in the mid 2020's) when the babyboom generation retires, benefit payments will begin to exceed payroll-

tax revenues. In the third 25-year period there will be a still higher
proportion of retirees to workers, and annual deficits will equal a
fourth of tax receipts, or a fifth of next benefits.

For the whole 75-year period we project a deficit of nearly $500

billion in 1986 dollars discounted to 1986. This is equal to about 0.44
percent of (discounted) taxable payroll)-3 Thus a rise in the Social
Security payroll tax rate of 0.44 percent effective now, or
substantially more later, would be needed to close the long-run OASI
trust fund deficit if the intermediate assumptions prove to be the case.
It is worth noting at this point why we present our figures in

discounted terms. First, this enables us to consider the present value
of potential futures of the OASI trust fund. This is especially
valuablee as we compare scenarios with different time paths of surpluses

13. This is slightly more than the 0.29 percent long-ten actuarial deficit
presented in the Trustees' Report. We discussed above how the latter
figure is not very meaningful, and how a calculation comparable to ours
would yield a deficit that is lower in magnitude. A further difference
is that our calculation asssuntes the new, lower marginal tax rates.
Under the old tax law our simulated deficit is about 0.34 percent of
taxable payroll. Finally, it should be noted that we make no effort to
calculate the future deficit in disability insurance (DI). The Social
Security Administration calculates this deficit as averaging 0.15
percent of taxable payroll, or half as large as the OASI deficit. The
Social Security Administration total projected OASDI deficit is thus
0.44 percent of taxable payroll. The projected deficit in Hospital
Insurance is another 3.5 percent.

12

and deficits. Secondly, it obviates the need to give explicit
consideration to the interest received (or paid out) by the trust fund
on its calculated surplus (or deficit), since we assume that the

interest and discount rates are identical. The present (1986) value of
the surplus or deficit in 2060 will equal the sum of the present values

of annual surpluses and deficits until then. As a corollary, it becomes
very simple to compute how taxes or benefits can or must be changesd to
bring the trust fund into actuarial balance.

The system finances are also presented in Figure 1, where the
discounted surplus both annually and on a cumulative basis for the

system are shown. On a cumulative basis the system starts to run a
deficit (assuming the surplus accrues and real interest is 2 percent)

around 2048, and on an annual basis, around 2025. We present below some
hypothetical scenarios of the surplus being dissipated or alternative
economic and demographic projections which alter these conclusions
substantially.

Table 2 presents results from our simulation of various typical
three different levels of earnings, two division of earnings between
the family members. The figures include expected present value of taxes,

benefits and transfers, and rates of return discounted both to the age
when the couples are 25 (for the purposes of comparision) and to 1986.
The discounted present value of transfers (and therefore, taxes and
benefits in general) varies markedly within each age cohort for
different levels of earnings (reflecting the progress ivity of the

benefit formulae) and income splits (with respect to the spousal

benefit), and to a lesser extent, the ceiling on taxable earnings. For
example, persons recently entering the system, born in 1960, have a

13

present value of transfers that ranges from a slight positive transfer
for low income earners to a substantial negative transfer for high-

income earners. The rates of return for taxes paid range from 3.4% for
the low-income single-earner family to 0.4% for the high income two-

earner family. The same pattern is repeated within each cohort. The
intragenerational redistributions are explored in much greater detail in
Boskin, Kotlikoff, Puffert and Shoven (1987).

The financial patterns for successive decadel cohorts born through
1992 are presented in panel b of Table 1. Retiree taxes, net benefits
(i.e., net of income taxation), the transfer received by those who live
to retire, and the taxes paid by nonsurvivors, together with the real

rates of return are presented. As can be seen, even those due to be
born in the immediate future are likely to get a slightly positive

transfer, computed at a 2 percent real rate of return. Thus, the rates
of return which are about 2 percent or more, indicate positive

transfers. Were we to use 3 percent, cohorts born after 1933 would be
receiving negative transfers.

Of course, since there is a long-run actuarial deficit of 0.44% of
taxable payroll, amounting in present value to approximately 500 billion

dollars, someone will have to pay it. The base case assumes that it is
paid by persons born after 1992, whose situation will be correspondingly

worse. We present information on how this varies for different rates of
return.

Thus, while we will primarily be dealing in the sequel with system
totals and aggregates by age cohorts, substantial variation remains
within each age cohort, and that variation will vary systematically as
we change economic and demographic assumptions and consider alternative

scenarios for dissipation of the surplus. In what follows we will

14

present only the situation for a typical middle income family with one
earner, a group which systematically earns a rate of return very close
to 2% cohort by cohort (see Table 2), rather than present a large string
of negative numbers for the well-off two-earner couple or a long string
of substantial positive numbers for low income one-earner couples. We
will focus on this case to see how one-earner middle income couples'

situations vary depending on the alternative scenarios. We do this to
reduce the system aggregate finances and the aggregate cohort amounts

for the cohorts to a per family basis. The heterogeneity that certainly
lies behind each of these scenarios should be borne in mind.

5.

Financial Impacts of Alternative Future Economic and Demographic
Patterns

The Social Security Administration's intermediate economic and
demographic assumptions are perhaps as reasonable as any, but we can be
sure that they will not be realized with great accuracy.14 It is thus
important to consider the impacts of a range of possible futures both on
the Social Security system's finances and on participants.

Tables 3 and 4 summarize the effects of using the Social Security
Administration's optimistic and pessimistic assumptions for future wage
growth, future mortality (and hence, life expectancy), future fertility

and various combinations of these parameters. Table 4 shows the wide

14. For an analysis of the inaccuracy of the economic and demographib
assumptions used in the past, see United States General Accounting
Office (1986).

15

variation in results for the financial solvency of the retirement trust

fund. The present (1986) value of the trust fund surplus (or deficit)
in 2060 ranges from +$3.4 trillion to -$2.6 trillion, for the combined
optimistic and pessimistic assumptions respectively.15 We see in the
column headed "year annual deficit begins" that only when the optimistic
assumptions are combined do tax receipts exceed benefit expenditures in
each year through 2060; otherwise current-flow deficits begin between

2014 and 2030. In the next column we see that the cumulative surplus
suffices, however, to cover benefit expenditures until 2024 in the most
pessimistic scenario and beyond 2060 in several of the optimistic
scenarios.

Table 4 compares the rates of return realized by each of the nine

decadal birth cohorts under the alternative scenarios. We note first
that, for later cohorts, the derived real rates of return vary among
scenarios from about one and one-half percent to over three percent.

In order to understand more closely how taxes, benefits, transfers,
and rates of return vary by scenario and cohort, let us now consider in
detail how each of our economic and demographic assumptions affects both
the finances of the Social Security retirement trust fund and the taxes

and benefits of those covered by Social Security. The figures discussed
below concerning the Social Security Administration's optimistic and
pessimistic scenarios are presented in still greater detail in Appendix

15. lJndiscounted, but still in 1986 dollars, the respective figures are
+$l4.7 trillion and -$11.1 trillion. Subsequent figures are also
presented in discounted terms. To remove discounting, multiply by 4.33.

16

Tables A.l and A.2.
The Social Security Administration's intermediate (Il-B) assumption

for growth in real wages, used in our base case, is that there will be
an annual gain of one and one-half percent (with some fluctuation in the

very short run). The optimistic assumption considers a gain of two and
one-half percent annually, and the pessimistic assumption considers a
gain of one percent.

Interestingly, higher wage growth is better both for the system's

finances and for participants in the system. An increase in the trust
fund's annual surplus (taxes minus benefits) proves consistent with a
higher ratio of benefits received to taxes paid for the participants.

The reason for this is that increases in taxes, which vary with total
wages, precede the increases in benefits to which wage growth leads.
The wage index is used in the formula for determining benefits, and so a
faster rise in this index provides a higher rate of return for

participants. What "balances the books" is a growth in the unfunded
liabilities of the retirement trust fund. These liabilities could
become quite burdensome if wage growth slows in the future.
We see in Table 3 that variation in wage growth changes taxes and
benefits in the same direction, but that taxes change to.a greater

extent. High wage growth increases the long-run surplus by $1.37
trillion, more than offsetting the long-run deficit expected under the

base case. Low wage growth deepens the long-run deficit by about $450
billion.

Higher (lower) wage growth increases (decreases) both taxes and

benefits. It increases (decreases) annual flows of taxes more than
benefits but, for a given cohort, increases (decreases) discounted

benefits more than discounted taxes. Rates of return for later cohorts

17

(also presented in Table 4) vary from about 2.2 percent under
intermediate wage growth to about 2.8 percent under high wage growth and
1.9 percent under low wage growth.

In assumptions about mortality, what is "optimistic" for the
solvency of the retirement trust fund is "pessimistic" for participants,

and vice versa. The trust fund is more solvent when people die sooner

and collect less in benefits. Table 3 shows that under the Social
Security Administration's high mortality (low life expectancy)
assumption the trust fund is better off by $963 billion over the 75-year
horizon, but that under the low mortality assumption the system is worse

off by $1.20 trillion. In Table 4 we see that for later cohorts the
rates of return are about 1.9 percent for high mortality and 2.7 percent

for low mortality. Higher (lower) mortality reduces (raises) benefits
much more than taxes for any cohort, as indeed for the trust fund's
annual flow as well.

Alternative assumptions about fertility matter only for those cohorts

not yet born, which are not presented in our tables. However, because
Social Security participatits begin paying taxes some forty years before

they receive benefits, fertility rates will have a big impact on trust

fund finances in the next century)6 Indeed, today's low fertility
rates are the most widely cited source of probable future problems in

Social Security finance. Current fertility rates are about 1.9 children
per woman over her child-bearing years. The Social Security

16. The level of immigration, especially of young people, will have an
impact for the same reason. We leave this matter for future
investigation.

18

Administration's intermediate assumption is that this will rise within
the next two decades to 2.0 children

per woman. The optimistic and

pessimistic assumptions are 2.3 and 1.6 respectively.17 The results of
our simulation, shown in Table 3, are that high fertility would add $694
billion to the trust fund surplus, more than eliminating what is
otherwise a deficit, while low fertility would add $837 billion to the
deficit.

We also derived results for scenarios which combine sets of

optimistic and pessimistic assumptions. The assumptions which are
optimistic for participants are high wage growth and low mortality
(fertility being irrelevant), while the assumptions which are optimistic
for trust fund finances are high wage growth, high mortality, and high

fertility. In the scenarios which are optimistic and pessimistic for
participants, rates of return for later cohorts are about 3.3 percent

and 1.6 percent respectively. Comparing Appendix Tables A.9 and A.lO,
we see that under the combined optimistic assumptions today's

young

children will pay a little more than twice as much in taxes as they
would under the combined pessimistic assumptions, but they will receive

nearly four times as much in benefits. The effects on system finances
are offsetting and do not differ greatly from the base case.

17. In our simulation we use the Social Security Administration's figures
for number of births each calendar year, which are derived from these
fertility rates. It should be noted that the fertility rates used by
the Social Security Administration refer to "the average number of
children who would be born to a woman in her lifetime if she were to
experience the birth rates by age observed in, or assumed for, the
selected year and if she were to survive the entire child-bearing
period."

19

Under the combined optimistic and pessimistic assumptions for trust
fund finances the differences from the intermediate scenario for long-

run surplus are +$3.88 trillion and -$2.07 trillion (Table 3). The
present value of taxes differs between these extreme scenarios by a
factor of nearly two, while benefits vary by a factor of about 1.3.

Figure 3 shows how the size of the accumulated trust fund varies
over the next 75 years for the overall optimistic, intermediate (base

case), and pessimistic scenarios. Note that the continuing increase in
the trust fund occurs only when the optimistic assumptions occur

simultaneously. For any one of the optimistic assumptions alone,
interest on the trust fund is eventually insufficient to cover the
difference between current benefits and current taxes, and the principal
itself is exhausted before 2090 (Table 3, last column).

6.

Financial Impact of Alternative Uses of the Potential Trust Fund
Surplus
We noted in the previous section that only under the combined optimistic

assumptions for wage growth, mortality, and fertility all together can
we hope that the retirement trust fund will take in at least as much

each year in taxes as it pays out in benefits. In all other cases an
accumulation in the trust fund is vital in order to forestall the time

when taxes must be raised or benefits reduced)8 Under intermediate

18. Of course, the consumption of the economy as a whole is limited by what
is produced, by those still living. Thus, in some sense Social Security
benefits must always be funded at the time they are paid. Still, the
method of financing Social Security determines who has what claims, and
this has important implications both for equity and efficiency.

20

assunptions, for example, an annual deficit will begin in 2025 but the
accumulated surplus will keep the trust fund solvent until 2048.

Unfortunately it has always proved difficult, for political

reasons, to accumulate a trust fund surplus. It is in the interest of
each session of Congress, and each administration, to raise benefits (or
perhaps to lower taxes, although that has not yet been tried) if

possible. Raising benefits conveys transfers to those receiving, or
soon to receive, benefits while imposing much of the cost of the action

on future generations which do not yet vote. Lowering taxes, similarly,
helps a current generation of workers while requiring higher taxes from
future generations than would otherwise be necessary.

The situation is now particularly acute for a major demographic

reason: in less than 30 years the baby-boom generation will begin to
retire. If we do not preserve the accumulation of a trust fund surplus
before then, future adjustments in payroll-tax rates or in benefits will
have to be much greater than would otherwise be necessary.
Figure 4 depicts the combined (employer and employee) tax rates
which would be required each year to fund currently-legislated benefits
(given intermediate assumptions) without adding to or drawing upon an

accumulated surplus. Until 202519 tax rates could be lowerthan
those currently legislated, but thereafter they would rise drastically.

19. The higher tax rate shown for 2022 is a quirk resulting from the way our
simulation handles the rise in retirement age, from 66 to 67, which
occurs around that time. We stimulate the change as occuring all at
once rather than phased in over several years.

21

Conversely, Figure 5 shows the level of benefits which could be

funded by each year's tax receipts. This level is presented in the form
of a ratio to benefits as provided for under current legislation. We
see that benefits could be raised intermittently through 2009, to a
level 30 percent higher than that now legislated, but that thereafter
they must either decline or, perhaps more plausible politically, be

maintained through increases in payroll tax rates. The tax rates
required to finance these increased benefits are depicted in the
broken line of Figure 4.

Tables 5 and 6 summarize the financial impacts of several

ways of

dissipating the trust-fund surplus which is projected to grow over the

next 35 to 40 years. "Pay-as-you-go tax rates" considers the scenario
in which, beginning in 1990, tax rates are set each year at a level

which exactly covers that year's benefit

payments. Similarily, "pay-as-

you-go benefits" considers, also for 1990 on, the adjustment of benefit

levels to match projected tax receipts. The tax rates and benefits
levels of these scenarios thus follow the hea-vy lines depicted in

Figures 4 and 5 respectively.

We consider 1990 a plausible starting date for these scenarios
because the party that takes office in 1989 will be glad to endear
itself to the voters before the 1990 congressional election.

By this

time the annual surplus in the trust fund will be an inviting target.
The "benefit ratchet" scenarios consider the cases in which
benefits rise to their pay-as-you-go peak in 2009 but do not

subsequently decline. The first of these scenarios notes the enormous
deficit ($3.69 trillion cununulative by 2060) generated when the higher

benefit level is not funded with taxes, while the second considers the
case of taxes rising, in a pay-as-you-go fashion, to fund the increased

22

benefits.

The last two of these scenarios consider what will happen if the
surplus which would accumulate over the next forty years is dissipated,

or directed to other purposes. Two very plausible possibilities for
this are that the surplus could be used to cover some of the massive
deficit in Social Security Hospital Insurance which will (absent a major
reform) develop within a few years2° or that the surplus will, in the face

of federal budget deficits, be used to fund other expenditures. The
first of these scenarios raises taxes in a pay-as-you-go fashion
beginning in 2025, the first year in which current benefit payments

exceed current tax receipts. The second of these scenarios reduces
benefits in a pay-as-you-go fashion from 2025 on. Thus these scenarios
are equivalent to the earlier pay-as-you-go scenarios from 2025 on; they
only lack the period in which tax or else benefit levels are more
favorable for participants than the levels currently legislated.

The chief result for system finances (Table 5) under all these
scenarios --

is

except, of course, the unfunded ratcheting of benefits --

that the long run surplus is, by construction, essentially

zero.21 The story for the successive cohorts, as we see in Table 6
and more extensively in Appendix Tables A.3 through A.8, is that some
gain and some lose as a result of these changes.

Thus under pay-as-you-go tax rates, those born until the 1980's

20. In practice, it is more likely that part of OASI's portion of payroll
tax will be reallocated to HI. The analysis of OASI finances would then be
similar to that of our pay-as-you-go taxrate scenario.
21. A deficit of $8 billion appears for some scenarios due to our simulation
showing a slight overall deficit between 1986 and 1989.

23

gain; the bulk of their working lives take place before 2025, when tax

rates must rise above those currently legislated. The big losers under
this scenario are those born in the next century, who will be subject to

payroll tax rates of over 13 percent by 2033 (and later over 14
percent), rather than the 10.98 percent currently legislated.

Under pay-as-you-go benefits, those who receive benefits mostly

before 2025 gain. Those born from the l950's on, who collect their
benefits after 2025, will do worse than projected under current

legislation. Those born today can expect a benefit reduction of 23
percent, for a rate of return of only about 1.5 percent.

With a ratcheting of benefits financed by tax increases, those born
until the present decade gain, as their increase in benefits more than
offsets the increase in taxes which they pay during part of their

working lives. But later cohorts bear the full brunt of these increased
tax rates (17 percent by 2033, and higher later, compared to 10.98
percent currently legislated) and hence do substantially worse overall.
When the surplus is dissipated, there are no gaining cohorts.

But those who pay taxes or collect benefits after 2025 suffer the same
losses as in the first two pay-as-you-go scenarios.

7.

Conclusion and Caveats

The results reported in this research suggest that Social
Security's retirement program offers vastly different terms to

households in different circumstances and in different cohorts. More
importantly, (net of any private intrafamily intergenerational transfers
which offset Social Security benefit payments, which we believe to be a
modest fraction of the total benefits) if we do not maintain a large

24

OASI trust fund, the alternative scenarios for return to

pay-as-you-go

finance differ dramatically in the taxes, benefits, transfers and real
rates of return which can be offered to different birth cohorts.

While it appears that the retirement part of Social Security

but

not hospital insurance -

- is

-

-

in sound short-run financial shape and

indeed, is projected to accummulate a very substantial surplus over the

next 35 to 40 years under intermediate economic and demographic
assumptions, various factors could intervene in this relatively rosy

short-run scenario. We have attempted to explore some plausible
alternatives to the surplus accruing: tax could be cut, benefits
increased, or the surplus diverted to other purposes. We have traced
their implications for the overall financial status of the system, the

time pattern of taxes, benefits and surpluses or deficits, and

therefore, the treatment of different age cohorts. Under the
intermediate

assumptions, the Social Security surplus is proj ected to

become almost as large as today's regular national debt. Obviously,
well before this would occur, enormous pressure would be placed on
financial markets. Since Hospital Insurance is scheduled to be accruing
a substantial deficit well before the surplus peaks, one likely scenario
is that Social Security will "borrow" from the retirement fund to bail

out the hospital insurance fund. The retirement surplus also could be a
signal to fiscal authorities that additional spending could be financed
on other programs, ignoring the simultaneously accruing future

liabilities in Social Security. The surplus could be dissipated if the
prospective increase in the retirement age is reduced, eliminated, or

postponed; and/or if the tax exempt amount is indexed. In all of these
situations, the short-run surplus would decrease substantially, and the

subsequent long-run deficit would worsen. The exact pattern of tax

25

collections and benefit payments might take a variety of forms, but each
of these would lead to a much worse deal for retirees in the distant
future versus current retirees or those retiring in the near future.
The Social Security retirement system finances are quite sensitive

to alternative economic and demographic events. We have presented
estimates based upon the Social Security Administration's pessimistic
and optimistic packages, but also "unpackaged" them so that we may
examine the marginal effect of changing mortality, fertility, and wage

growth assumptions. Again, the patterns are revealing. Except in the
optimistic package, the discounted value of the Social Security
retirement system fund over the next 75 years is negative, and is
subject to substantial potential negative shocks for the reasons
discussed above.

We have mentioned a number of caveats to our results throughout the

paper. First, the new income tax law is certain to change over the time
horizon we examine and probably sooner rather than later.

Marginal

rates may change, Social Security benefits may be taxed fully, some or

all of the tax collections from the taxation of Social Security benefits
may accrue to general funds to help pay for deficits rather than be
credited to Social Security at the time of surplus, etc.

Second, we

mentioned that the value of Social Security benefits may exceed their
expected present value because they are paid as inflation-adjusted joint

survivor life annuties. Exactly how to make the adjustments is unclear.
Bernheim (1986) argues that a strict adherence to the life-cycle model -

- at

least the aspect of it that implies an average propensity to

consume, over one's lifetime, of one -- and imperfections in annuity

markets imply that actuarial discounting is inappropriate, and argues

26

that simple discounting may be desirable. While we do not hold to this
extreme form of the life-cycle model in this paper and there is
substantial evidence that if individuals are given the option, they
refuse to annuitize their wealth (for example, college professors
covered by TIA usually decline annuitization in favor of some years
certain in their retirement pension), we do not believe that simple
discounting is a sensible alternative to actuarial discounting for the

whole population. However, to the extent that a fraction of the
population we consider is appropriately considered as pure life-cycle
savers and subject to the imperfections in annuity markets, some method
of aggregating heterogeneous individuals within cohorts is desirable and
perhaps some convex combination of actuarial and simple discounting

would be necessary. Simple discounting would alter the benefits and
taxes only a few percentage points, given a real discount rate of 2

percent or 3 percent. Again, we would argue that these factors should
be applied only to some fraction of the population, not the entire
population. For the system totals, such adjustments are unnecessary;
indeed, they only make sense for examining the individual cases rather
than the system aggregate totals.

Related questions revolve around comparing taxes paid earlier in
life and benefits received later in life. Taxes might be paid at a time
in life when households are constrained in liquidity; Social Security
benefits may be systematically subject to different types of risks than

labor earnings or returns from assets. Hence, the taxes may be
differentially risky since they are paid on realized earnings during

working years relative to Social Security benefits. Again, these issues
have been discussed in more detail elsewhere (see Boskin and Shoven
(1985)).

27

Thus, some risk adjustment may be necessary. Some have even
suggested that the appropriate discount rate should be zero because
Social Security benefits really are a safe asset and that is close to
the real return on government securities (safe assets) over the longterm (Henry Aaron, Alicia Munnell and others have made this argument).

First, adjusting for differences in risk other than mortality risk by

adjusting discount rates is inappropriate. Modern finance theory
teaches that a charge for risk should be assigned in the appropriate
period and the appropriate measure of net adjusted benefits should then

be discounted at the rate of time preference. Second, it is unclear
whether Social Security benefits or earnings or the returns to other

assets are differentially risky. Indeed, it is not just their inherent
risk but their covariance with other components of income for households

which would determine the nature of the risk charge to be applied. For
persons already retired, one would expect that uncertainty would be

relatively modest; for those due to retire in the distant future, there
is substantial uncertainty regarding the level of such Social Security

payments. This stems from the Social Security system's long-ten
financial solvency problems as well as the desire of many to means-test

the program fully. Thus, well-off individuals may wind up getting
nothing in the future as the way to deal with the financial solvency

problem. We merely point these issues out for the interested reader and
refer them to the other papers mentioned for further discussion, but
these caveats should be borne in mind in interpreting the results
reported here.
