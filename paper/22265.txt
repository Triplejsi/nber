The Impact of Health Insurance on Preventive Care and Health Behaviors: Evidence from
the 2014 ACA Medicaid Expansions
Kosali Simon, Aparna Soni, and John Cawley
NBER Working Paper No. 22265
May 2016, Revised September 2016
JEL No. I12,I13,I28
ABSTRACT
The U.S. population receives suboptimal levels of preventive care and has a high prevalence of
risky health behaviors. One goal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was to increase preventive
care and improve health behaviors by expanding access to health insurance.
This paper estimates how the ACA-facilitated state-level expansions of Medicaid in 2014
affected these outcomes. Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and a
difference-in-differences model that compares states that did and did not expand Medicaid, we
examine the impact of the expansions on preventive care (e.g. dental visits, immunizations,
mammograms, cancer screenings), risky health behaviors (e.g. smoking, heavy drinking, lack of
exercise, obesity), and self-assessed health.
We find that the expansions increased insurance coverage and access to care among the targeted
population of low-income childless adults. The expansions also increased use of certain forms of
preventive care but there is no evidence that they increased ex ante moral hazard (i.e., there is no
evidence that risky health behaviors increased in response to health insurance coverage). The
Medicaid expansions also modestly improved self-assessed health.

1. Introduction
In the United States and other developed countries, failure to utilize preventive care and
participation in risky health behaviors are major contributors to morbidity, health disparities,
medical care costs, and mortality (NCHS, 2015; US PSTF, 2014; US DHHS, 2011; US DHHS,
2000). Examples of relevant preventive care include flu vaccinations and cancer screenings, and
examples of relevant risky health behaviors include physical inactivity and tobacco use (US
DHHS, 2011). The need to increase preventive care and improve health behaviors has been
emphasized by the U.S. Surgeon General (US DHHS, 2014; US DHHS, 2010a), the U.S.
Preventive Services Task Force (US PSTF, 2005), the National Prevention Council (NPC, 2011),
and the Healthy People 2020 initiative (US DHHS, 2010b, 2000). Particular emphasis has been
put on improving such behaviors among low-income and otherwise disadvantaged populations,
with the goal of reducing health disparities (e.g. US DHHS, 2011; US DHHS, 2010b).
Health insurance is seen as an important mechanism for increasing use of preventive care
and improving health behaviors; this was a stated rationale of the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 (ASPE, 2015; US DHHS, 2016). 2 The ACA mandates that
health insurance plans, including Medicaid, cover preventive services without cost-sharing as
part of the “10 Essential Benefits” package. The law also expands insurance to vulnerable
populations, increasing their contact with the healthcare system and exposing them to healthcare
professionals’ advice regarding healthy behaviors (Trust for America’s Health, 2013). In this
paper we examine whether the insurance expansions that took place under the ACA had their
intended effects of increasing preventive care and improving health behaviors.
2

The ACA also sought to promote healthy behaviors by expanding the scope for wellness programs to offer
financial rewards for smoking cessation and weight loss; see Cawley (2014). This change took place nationwide on
January 1, 2014, unlike the Medicaid expansion, which was at the discretion of states and varied by year. Wehby et
al. (2015) finds a strong genetic influence on preferences toward prevention, overall prevention effort, and routine
checkups, which raises the possibility that genes may modify the effects of the ACA on preventive care.

2

The ACA had many insurance expansion components; the one that we examine concerns
the Medicaid program. The ACA originally required that all states expand Medicaid to all adults
whose income was below 138% of the federal poverty line (FPL). However, in 2012, the
Supreme Court allowed states to opt out of this requirement, with the result that only 31 states
plus DC had expanded Medicaid by the end of 2015: two in 2011, four in 2012, 22 in 2014, and
three in 2015 (Sommers, Kenney, & Epstein, 2014; Kaiser Family Foundation, 2015). In these
expansion states, Medicaid was made available to a key demographic group that was previously
largely ineligible for any public health insurance: low-income, non-elderly, non-disabled
childless adults (henceforth referred to as “childless adults”). 3 This is a key group that we
examine in this study.
In theory, the impact of gaining health insurance coverage on preventive care seems
clear: the law of demand implies that a reduction in the out-of-pocket cost of preventive care
should result in increased utilization. However, consumers may not be very sensitive to the price
of preventive care; the RAND Health Insurance Experiment estimated that the price elasticity of
demand for preventive care is in the range of -0.17 to -0.43 (Newhouse & The Insurance
Experiment Group, 1993; Aron-Dine, Einav, & Finkelstein, 2013; Ringel et al., 2002). Reasons
that the demand for preventive care may be relatively inelastic include long wait times at
provider offices (Anderson, Camacho, & Balkrishnan, 2007), the discomfort associated with
screenings such as mammograms and colonoscopies (Takahashi, et al., 2005), and the anxiety
associated with screenings for conditions such as cancer or HIV (Lerman et al. 1993; Kash et al.,
1992). The RAND Health Insurance Experiment found that, even in the zero-copay (free) plan,

3

The eligibility of parents was also affected, but to a much lesser degree because of a pre-existing avenue for
access to Medicaid. Among expansion states, parents’ eligibility increased from a median 100% FPL to 138% FPL
whereas childless adults’ eligibility increased from a median 0% to 138% (Artiga & Cornachione, 2016).

3

the majority of adult males used no preventive services at all for the entire three-year period of
the study; thus, the authors note that even with free care, uptake of preventive services can fall
far short of accepted standards (Newhouse & The Insurance Experiment Group 1993).
The impact of health insurance on health behaviors is ambiguous. Any increase in contact
with health care providers resulting from health insurance could reduce risky health behaviors.
Primary care physicians are recommended to screen their patients for tobacco use, alcohol
misuse, obesity, and HIV infection, and to provide behavioral counseling for persons engaged in
risky health behaviors (US PSTF, 2014). On the other hand, insurance coverage may cause ex
ante moral hazard; patients have less incentive to reduce their risky health behaviors because
they no longer pay the full financial cost of their future illness (Ehrlich & Becker, 1972). For
example, Dave & Kaestner (2009) find that Medicare coverage increases the probability of daily
alcohol consumption among men. However, health insurance does not reduce the non-financial
consequences of illness, such as physical pain and suffering, which could limit the extent of ex
ante moral hazard (Ehrlich & Becker, 1972).
One final mechanism by which health insurance may affect these outcomes is the income
effect. The newly-insured may allocate some of the funds they would have otherwise devoted to
health care towards risky health behaviors (e.g. cigarettes or eating more) or towards health
improvements. Evidence of income effects on health behaviors is mixed. To take the example of
weight, studies have found that income increases BMI among lower-income youths (Akee et al.,
2013) and lower-income women (Schmeiser, 2009) but not among lower-income men
(Schmeiser, 2009) or Social Security recipients (Cawley, Moran, & Simon, 2010). In summary,
health insurance coverage may affect health behaviors through multiple channels; the net impact
is theoretically ambiguous and thus is ultimately an empirical question.

Although studies have looked at the impact of the 2014 Medicaid expansions on
insurance coverage, hospital stays, and diagnoses of diabetes and cholesterol (Wherry & Miller,
2016), 4 this paper is the first to estimate the impact of the 2014 Medicaid expansions on health
behaviors. More broadly, it contributes to the growing literature on the effects of the ACA, and
on the effects of health insurance in general. The existing studies of the 2014 expansions have
found that they increased insurance coverage and improved access to care (ASPE, 2015;
Sommers et al., 2015; Shartzer, Long, & Anderson, 2015; Sommers, Blendon, & Orav, 2016;
Kaestner et al., 2015; Wherry & Miller, 2016; Frean, Gruber, & Sommers, 2016; Courtemanche
et al., 2016) with no discernible effects on labor market outcomes (Gooptu, et al., 2016;
Kaestner, et al., 2015).
Others have studied the effects of the state Medicaid expansions that took place prior to
2014 and found that these “early” Medicaid expansions increased insurance coverage (Sommers,
Kenney, & Epstein, 2014), lowered mortality, reduced cost barriers to care, and improved selfassessed health (Sommers, Baicker, & Epstein, 2012). There is little evidence of how these early
Medicaid expansions affected health behaviors.
While this paper is the first to study the effect of the 2014 Medicaid expansions on
preventive care and health behaviors, prior research has studied the effects on these outcomes
from earlier expansions of health insurance, such as the ACA’s mandate to cover young adults
(Barbaresco, Courtemanche, & Qi, 2015), the Oregon Medicaid experiment (Finkelstein et al.,
2012), the Massachusetts healthcare reform of 2006 (Van Der Wees, Zaslavsky, & Ayanian,
2013; Courtmanche & Zapata, 2014; Miller, 2012), the Medicaid and CHIP expansions for
4

Wherry & Miller (2016) examine the National Health Interview Survey data through 2014, whereas this paper
examines the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System through 2015. The papers have some overlap in
outcomes (insurance coverage, access, self-assessed health), but this paper examines numerous measures of
preventive care and health behavior, as well as effects among sub-populations of childless adults and parents, men
and women, that are not studied in Wherry & Miller (2016).

children and low-income parents in the 1990s (Epstein & Newhouse, 1998), and the RAND
health insurance experiment (Newhouse & The Insurance Experiment Group, 1993; Brook et al.,
1983). In the concluding section of this paper we compare our results with those of these prior
studies.
We contribute to the literature on insurance and health behaviors in four ways. First, we
add to the growing body of research on the effects of one of the largest insurance expansions to
date – the ACA Medicaid expansion. Second, we provide the first evidence of the effect of these
expansions on preventive care and health behaviors. Much of the current research on the ACA
Medicaid expansions studies their impact on use of acute care rather than preventive care. This is
likely due to the ready availability of large-scale administrative datasets on hospital discharges.
However, a key motivation expressed by policy-makers for the expansions is the potential for
cost savings from increased preventive care and improved health behaviors. We examine an
extensive set of measures of each, such as routine checkups, flu shots, HIV tests, dental visits,
cancer screenings, smoking, exercise, risky drinking, and obesity. In addition, we examine the
effect on insurance coverage and perceived access to care (which are likely preconditions for
improvements in preventive care and health behaviors) and the ultimate outcome of self-assessed
health.
Third, by separately estimating effects for childless adults, we examine the impact of
insurance coverage for a novel population. Earlier insurance expansions primarily benefitted
children, pregnant women, and low-income parents. The 2010 dependent insurance provision of
the ACA affected young adults whose parents had access to employer-sponsored insurance; this
group was likely to be higher income than the Medicaid eligible population. In contrast, the 2014
Medicaid expansions that we study primarily benefitted low-income childless adults, which is a

6

population with reduced eligibility for other public welfare programs and higher risk for poor
health behaviors and outcomes. Therefore, the low-income population we study may respond
differently than those affected by earlier expansions. Fourth, we are the first to use a second year
of post-expansion data to estimate their effects.
The outline of the paper is as follows. In section 2, we describe our data. In Section 3, we
describe our difference-in-differences model. Section 4 presents the empirical results, and
Section 5 concludes.

Data: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)
Our primary data source is the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), an

annual telephone survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state
governments to collect information on health behaviors, insurance coverage, and health
outcomes. The survey is conducted every month in all 50 states and the District of Columbia
through random-digit dialing. The survey is designed to be representative of the noninstitutionalized adult population in the United States.
The BRFSS has several advantages that make it useful for our analysis. First, it includes
many outcome variables of interest: insurance status, access to care, preventive care usage,
health behaviors, and self-assessed health. It also includes state identifiers and relevant
demographic characteristics. The large sample size of nearly 500,000 each year ensures that
there is a substantial sample of the people most affected by the recent Medicaid expansions: lowincome childless adults. The BRFSS also has its limitations; prior to 2014 it does not record the
source of insurance, so while we know whether people have health insurance in those earlier
years, we do not know if it is Medicaid. In addition, the BRFSS is a repeated cross-section, so it

7

is not possible to observe transitions from uninsured to coverage through Medicaid. Despite
these limitations, the dataset’s size, comprehensiveness, and timely availability offer an
important opportunity to learn about the early effects of the Medicaid expansions on preventive
care and health behaviors. 5
For our primary analysis, we use the BRFSS data for 2010-2015. 6 The BRFSS provides
information about date of interview, so our unit of time is quarter; using quarter rather than year
allows us to examine pre-trends in more detail, which is important because our difference-indifferences model (explained in the next section) relies on the assumption of parallel trends
between the expansion and non-expansion states.
We restrict the BRFSS sample to the group targeted by the Medicaid expansion: lowincome adults below age 65. The criteria for inclusion in the estimation sample are that
respondents must be aged 19-64 and report household incomes below 100% of the FPL. 7 We
also conduct subsample analysis in which we stratify our sample by gender (women vs. men) and
parental status (childless adults vs. parents). Although BRFSS records income only in categories,
household income is reported in $5,000 to $7,500 brackets at the lower income levels and the
specific cutoffs of $10,000 and $15,000 match fairly well with the federal poverty level. We use
5

Another advantage of the BRFSS is that at 49%, its response rate is relatively high compared to other surveys
such as the Gallup Healthways Wellbeing Index which has a response rate of only 5-10 percent. The high response
rate reduces the risk of sample selection bias. Although other datasets such as the National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS) have higher response rates, their sample sizes are much lower than the BRFSS. The NHIS sample size, for
example, is about one-sixth the size of the BRFSS, and may not allow for the subsample analysis we are able to
conduct using the BRFSS.
6
There was a change in BRFSS weighting methodology in 2011, which we account for by reconstructing each
individual’s sample weight as the fraction of their assigned BRFSS sample weight over the sum of all individuals’
sample weights for that year. Also, we exclude Q3 2011 and Q4 2011 due to data quality issues with the insurance
variable in BRFSS. While most states experienced minimal change in insurance rate of low-income adults in 2011
going from Q3 to Q4, the following experienced changes greater than 10 percentage points in that time period:
NH (+18 pp), SD (+15 pp), AK (-12 pp), WI (-14 pp), IN (+11 pp), MN (+11 pp), CO (+10 pp), TN (-10 pp), UT
(+10 pp). These changes are too large to be plausible. Furthermore, these anomalies represent spikes in Q4 2011,
with returns to previous levels in Q1 2012 onwards. This data quality problem occurs only in the last two quarters of
2011; thus we remove these two quarters from our dataset.
7
Approximately 12.5% of observations in our sample are missing income data (response was “unsure,” “refused
to answer,” or otherwise missing); we dropped these observations for our analysis.

8

the upper threshold of the BRFSS income category as well as the reported household size to
assign each respondent a percentage of the FPL, 8 and we drop from the sample individuals with
FPL values greater than 100%. Although the Medicaid expansion was available for adults up to
138% FPL, we only examine those under 100% FPL because adults with income 100%-138%
FPL in non-expansion states received another insurance expansion treatment – they became
eligible for exchange subsidies in 2014. 9
We define treatment states as those states that expanded Medicaid by December 2015
(i.e. AK, AZ, AR, CA, CO, CT, DE, DC, HI, IL, IN, IA, KY, MD, MA, MI, MN, NH, NJ, NY,
ND, NM, NV, OH, OR, PA, RI, VT, WA, WI, 10 and WV) and control states as those states that
did not expand Medicaid or expanded later than December 2015 (i.e. AL, FL, GA, ID, KS, LA,
ME, MS, MO, MT, NE, NC, OK, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VA, and WY). The Medicaid expansion
became effective in January 2014 for all expansion states except for the following: AK
(September 2015), IN (February 2015), LA (July 2016), MI (April 2014), MT (January 2016),
NH (August 2014), and PA (January 2015). Since our data go through 2015, we identified those
states that expanded after January 2014 but before January 2016 as expansion states only in the
quarters after the expansion was implemented.

8
For example, in 2012, the federal poverty level for a family of 2 was $15,930. Respondents who had a
household size of 2 and income in the “less than $10,000” were coded as 63% FPL ($10,000/$15,930), income in
the “$10,000-$15,000” category were coded as 94% FPL ($15,000/$15,930), and income in the “$15,000-20,000”
category were coded as 126% FPL ($20,000/$15,930).
9
Kaestner et al. (2015) use low education to identify those eligible for Medicaid because the ACA could affect
income through the mechanism of health. We chose to use low income to define Medicaid eligibility, given that
there has been no detectable labor market impact of the Medicaid expansions (Gooptu et al., 2015), and because
income and education are only weakly correlated in the BRFSS data; e.g. among non-elderly, childless adults
earning under the poverty line in the BRFSS in 2012, only 21% reported education less than high school.
Furthermore, only 31% of those with education less than high school reported that their income was below the
poverty level. As a robustness check later in the paper, we use low education rather than low income to define
eligibility for Medicaid.
10
Although Wisconsin was not an ACA expansion state, the state received federal approval to offer Medicaid to
childless adults below 100% FPL through the BadgerCare program (Gates & Rudowitz, 2014). We therefore include
it in our treatment group.

9

Some states in our treatment group partially expanded public insurance to low-income
adults before 2014. (For more information on the categorization of states, and the details of each
state expansion, see Table A1.) However, most of these expansions were limited compared to the
2014 and after expansions both in terms of eligibility and generosity of insurance benefits. Most
states that offered Medicaid or Medicaid-like benefits to low-income adults before 2014 still
experienced considerable expansion in or after 2014. Therefore, for our main specification, we
include all 30 expansion states plus DC in our treatment group and all 20 non-expansion states in
our control group. This approach follows Courtemanche, et al. (2016). As sensitivity checks, we
also estimate a set of models in which we drop nine states plus DC that partially expanded
Medicaid to childless adults before 2014, and another in which we drop the four states plus DC
that had the strongest Medicaid expansions before 2014, in order to focus on treatment and
control groups of states that are as “clean” as possible; results for these “clean” expansion
models are provided in Appendix A.
Our outcomes of interest are categorized into five groups. When we have multiple
measures for the same category of outcome, we create an index variable that reflects all of the
measures in that category. We briefly describe the outcomes below; Appendix B provides
additional details on the definitions of the variables and the language of the BRFSS questions on
which they are based.
Insurance Coverage. We first assess the impact of the Medicaid expansion on insurance
status, because any impact of the expansion on health behaviors and preventive care is assumed
to operate through changes in insurance coverage. Insurance is coded as a binary variable equal
to 1 if the respondent answered yes to having any form of healthcare coverage at the time of the

10

interview, 0 if the respondent answered no, and missing if the respondent was unsure or refused a
response.
Access to care. We examine access to care because we see it as another important
mechanism for any impacts on preventive care or health behaviors. Our two measures of access
to care are: 1) an indicator variable for whether the subject has a primary care physician at the
time of the interview; and 2) an indicator variable for whether the subject answered “yes” to the
question, “Was there a time in the past 12 months when you needed to see a doctor but could not
because of cost?” Each is treated as a separate outcome, and we also create an index variable
that equals one if the subject either has a primary care physician or replied that cost was not a
barrier to care.
Preventive care. We construct binary variables for having received a routine checkup in
the past year, a flu vaccination (shot or spray) in the past year, an HIV screening ever, and a
dental visit in the past year. 11 Certain types of preventive care are relevant only for women:
whether received a pap test in the past year (recommended for women aged 21 and older), a
clinical breast exam in the past year (recommended for women aged 21 and older), and a
mammogram in the past year (recommended for women aged 50 and older); see US PSTF
(2014). Data on dentist visits, cancer screenings index, clinical breast exams, Pap tests, and
mammograms were not available for most states in BRFSS 2011 and 2013, and so we drop the
years 2011 and 2013 only for these outcomes. We also construct an index that measures the total
number of such preventive care services (routine checkups, flu vaccination, HIV test, and dentist
visits) an individual received in the past year. For women, we construct an index for whether
11

Most of the ACA expansion states only provide “limited” dental coverage for adults; see Buchmueller, Miller,
and Vujicic (2016) for details on state Medicaid dental provision generosity. Medicaid generally does not cover
major restorative procedures like crowns, but the dental coverage provided in almost all of our expansion states is
generous enough to at least cover routine cleanings and inexpensive care. Thus, it is plausible that the Medicaid
expansion could affect whether adults visited a dentist at least once in the past year.

11

they received at least one recommended cancer screening (pap test, breast exam, or
mammogram) for their age group.
Health behaviors. We examine six measures of health behaviors: 1) an indicator variable
for whether the person has smoked in the past month; 2) an indicator for whether the person has
engaged in heavy drinking (defined as averaging two drinks per day for men and one drink per
day for women) in the past month; 3) an indicator for whether the person has engaged in binge
drinking (defined as having x or more drinks on one occasion, where x=5 for men and x=4 for
women) in the past month; 4) an indicator for whether the person has participated in any physical
activities or exercise in the past month; 5) body mass index or BMI (calculated as weight in kg
divided by height in meters squared 12; and 6) an indicator for whether the person is obese (i.e.
BMI ≥ 30); see Appendix B for more detail on the BRFSS questions on which these variables are
based. We also create an index that equals one if the individual is a smoker, has not exercised in
the past month, is a heavy drinker, is a binge drinker, or is obese.
Self-assessed health. We examine four measures of self-assessed health: 1) the
individual’s self-rated health on a scale of 1 to 5 13; 2) the number of days in the past month that
physical health was not good, reported by the respondent; 3) the number of days in the past
month that mental health was not good, reported by the respondent; and 4) the number of days in
the past month that the individual’s poor health prevented usual activities such as work. In

12

The BRFSS collects only self-reports, not measurements, of weight and height, so BMI is likely underestimated
(Cawley et al., 2015). Because weight is a dependent variable rather than independent variable, this error will not
necessarily bias coefficients but it will increase the standard errors.
13
This outcome (individual’s self-rated general health) is measured on an ordinal 5-point scale in our main
specification, which implies that the distance between a 1 and a 2 (poor vs. fair health) has the same meaning as the
distance between a 4 and 5 (very good vs. excellent). To better assess changes in self-assessed health, we
dichotomized the “general health” index into a series of indicator variables and estimated separate models for each
of these three outcomes. Results for the dichotomized models are in Appendix D.

12

addition, we construct an index of number of unhealthy days that is the sum of days in the past
month that the respondent had physical or mental health that was not good, top-coded at 30.
We examine a large number of diverse outcomes. Following the literature (e.g.
Barbaresco, Courtemanche, & Qi, 2015), we do not use multiple hypothesis test adjustments
such as the Bonferroni adjustment in our main analysis. The Bonferroni adjustment is
appropriate when, e.g., a large number of outcomes are used without preplanned hypotheses (i.e.
data mining), or one is more interested in whether all tests are jointly not significant as opposed
to being interested in the results of individual tests (Armstrong, 2014). Our outcomes are diverse,
but all are plausibly affected by health insurance coverage, and we are more interested in the
results of individual tests than a single test of whether we cannot reject any null hypotheses. Still,
our model involves estimating 25 equations, and it may be unrealistic to assume no correlation in
the error terms across outcomes. In order to assess multiple inference, we follow the approach
used in Autor and Houseman (2010), i.e. Seemingly Unrelated Regression. Results and a detailed
explanation of the method are in Appendix G.
Our models control for the following regressors: indicator variables for marital status, age
in years, employment status, gender, race/ethnicity, household income category, education,
household size, and whether the individual is part of the BRFSS cell phone sample as opposed to
the land line sample. Additionally, we control for the quarterly state unemployment rate,
obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to account for possible different impacts of the
post-2009 economic recovery in different states.

3. Methods

13

We estimate difference-in-differences (DD) models that compare changes in outcomes in
the treatment states to changes in the same outcomes in the control states. The sample consists
solely of low-income adults below age 65. The “pre” period is 2010-13, and the “post” period is
2014-15. The treatment states are the 30 states plus DC that by December 2015 expanded
Medicaid to low-income adults, and the control states are the 20 states that had not yet expanded
Medicaid to this population; see Table A1. For each of our outcome variables, we estimate the
following DD regression:
Yist = α + β(Treatments*Postt)+ γXist + ηUnempRatest + δStates + ϑTimet + ε

(1)

where Yist represents a health-related outcome for individual i living in state s at time t, expressed
as a quarter/year combination. For the binary outcomes, we estimate linear probability models
because they typically give reliable estimates of average effects (Angrist & Pischke, 2008);
however, as a robustness check, we also estimate these models as logits.
Treatment is a binary variable equal to 1 if the individual lives in a treatment state and
equal to 0 if the respondent lives in a control state. Post is a binary variable equal to 1 if the time
period is after the policy implementation (i.e. any quarter of 2014-15) and equals 0 if the time
period is prior to the policy implementation (i.e. any quarter of 2010-2013). X is the vector of
control variables: household income, education, gender, race, unemployment status, age, gender,
marital status, household size, and cell phone sample indicator. UnempRate is a continuous
variable measuring the state unemployment rate in a given quarter/year. State is a vector of state
fixed effects, and Time is a vector of quarter/year-fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by
state. 14

14

Although we have 51 clusters which may be considered a sufficient number (Cameron, Gelbach, & Miller,
2008), we note that standard asymptotic tests may over-reject the null hypothesis with a small number of clusters. In
Appendix E, we assess whether our results are robust to an alternative method of conducting inference. Following
examples in Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller (2008) and Akosa Antwi, Moriya, and Simon (2013), we use as our left-

Identification of the treatment effect relies upon the parallel trends assumption: that the
control states are a good counterfactual for the treatment states; i.e. that in the absence of the
treatment, outcomes in the treatment states would have followed the same trend as those in the
control states. If true, then the DD coefficient β identifies the effect of Medicaid expansions on
the outcome.
The decision to expand Medicaid was controversial and highly politicized in many states
(Jacobs & Callaghan, 2013). Given that more liberal states tended to expand while more
conservative states chose not to expand, there may be violations of the parallel trends assumption
that could cause bias. For this reason, we first assess the validity of this assumption by
comparing pre-treatment trends in outcomes in the treatment and control states. We do this by
first visually assessing graphs of the trends. We then formalize the pre-policy trends test by
estimating regressions that interact the treatment group indicator with year indicator variables for
all years except 2013 which is the base year. The coefficients on these interaction terms reflect
the impact in the expansion states relative to non-expansion states, compared to the base year
2013. If expansion and non-expansion states trended similarly before the treatment, then the
coefficient on the pre-2014 interaction terms should be close to 0. We jointly test the null
hypothesis that all pre-2014 interaction terms equal 0 using an F test.
Our main models are estimated for men and women pooled, but we also estimate models
separately by sex. Past literature suggests that men and women are different in their levels of risk
aversion and may respond differently to insurance coverage (Jianakoplos & Bernasek, 1998;
Barbaresco, Courtemanche, & Qi, 2015). We also estimate models separately by parental status
hand variable the mean of each outcome variable calculated at year-quarter level for treatment and control groups.
This reduces the number of observations to 44, and we cluster at year-quarter level of 22 clusters. Our right-hand
side variables are an indicator for expansion, an indicator for the period following the start of Medicaid expansion
(January 2014 and onwards), and an interaction of these. As shown in Table A4, using the wild cluster bootstrap-t
procedure does not affect the statistical significance of the majority of our results.

to assess whether childless adults responded differently to the expansion than parents. This is
important as in some expansion states, low-income parents had limited eligibility for public
insurance programs prior to 2014 whereas childless adults were largely ineligible for coverage in
all states, so we expect the impact of expansion to be stronger for childless adults than for
parents.
One might be concerned that there were shocks to outcomes in expansion states (but not
control states) that could create bias. For example, one might be concerned that states that were
experiencing a strong macroeconomy or had a strong budget outlook might expand not just
Medicaid but other programs as well, which would cause upward bias in estimates of the effect
of the expansions. On the other hand, one might be concerned that, to fund the Medicaid
expansion, states cut back on other state programs, which could cause attenuation bias in
estimates of the effect of the expansions. If either occurred, that would violate the identifying
assumptions of the DD model. For suggestive evidence on whether the possibility of
simultaneous changes in other programs should be a concern, we conduct two falsification tests.
Specifically, we estimate the same models for populations whose eligibility for health insurance
was unaffected by the 2014 Medicaid expansions: low-income adults over age 65 (continually
eligible for Medicare, with eligibility for Medicaid unchanged) and high-income adults (defined
as adults with household income above 400% of the FPL and thus never eligible for Medicaid).
Because the Medicaid eligibility of each of these two groups was not affected by the 2014
expansions, we expect to find no effect of the expansions on their preventive care or health
behaviors; if we find such effects, it would imply that the model is biased due to violations in the
parallel trends assumption. Failure to find such effects is of course not proof that the parallel

16

trends assumption is correct, but the failure to reject the null hypothesis of no effect provides
some additional confidence in the approach.
Finally, we assess the robustness of the findings of the main model to numerous
variations in the sample and model specification.

4. Empirical Results
Summary Statistics
We first compare, in Appendix I (Table A8), the sample means of our outcomes and
selected control variables for the treatment and control groups, both before and after expansion.
Although t-tests suggest that treatment and control states are significantly different in terms of
mean age, education, gender, unemployment status, and race/ethnicity, the differences tend to be
small (e.g. just over a year of age, less than a quarter of a year of education), and we account for
these differences by controlling for these variables in our regression models. The identifying
assumption of the DD model does not concern equal means, but parallel trends; examining this
assumption is the subject of the next subsection. 15

Plausibility of the Parallel Trends Assumption

15

We also examine the sample sizes and BRFSS response rates in our main study sample of low-income adults in
the treatment and control states before and after expansion to ensure that the composition of individuals responding
to the survey is not changing differentially between the two groups of states. In expansion states, we calculate a
response rate of 44.1% in 2013 and 44.8% in 2014 (i.e. a change of 0.7 percentage points). In non-expansion states,
we calculate a response rate of 44.8% in 2013 and 45.6% in 2014 (i.e. a change of 0.8 percentage points). We
conclude that there is no evidence that individuals are more or less likely to respond to the BRFSS if their state
expands Medicaid.

17

We examine the visual evidence concerning parallel trends in Figure 1, which presents
the trends in outcomes for our study sample, separately for the treatment and control groups. 16 In
each graph, the vertical line on the left indicates Q4 of 2013, and the vertical line on the right
indicates Q1 of 2014; thus, the Medicaid expansion of January 2014 happened in between the
vertical lines. The top-left graph in Figure 1 shows that the treatment and control states had
similar trends in insurance coverage before the expansion. After the expansion, insurance
coverage rises in the treatment states relative to the control states, as one would expect. We
provide graphs illustrating the trends in our other outcome variables in Figure 1 and Appendix C;
the other outcomes also exhibit similar pre-trends for the expansion and non-expansion states.
[ Insert Figure 1 here ]
We more formally test for equality of the pre-expansion trends using the event-study
method. We estimate regressions that interact the treatment group dummy with year dummy
variables (omitting 2013 as the reference year). We jointly test the null hypothesis that all pre2014 interaction terms are equal to 0 using an F test. If we were to find that outcomes were
changing for the treatment group relative to the control group even before the policy change, that
would suggest that the DD estimate is biased. Results are presented in Appendix J (Table A9).
The first two columns of Table A9 show the coefficients on the interaction of the expansion
states with the indicator variables for 2015 (column 1) and 2014 (column 2); these represent the
policy effects against which to judge the prior trends.
Panel 1 of Table A9 shows that the trends in insurance coverage prior to the Medicaid
expansions are not significantly different between the treatment and control groups; column 7
16

We note that even prior to the Medicaid expansion, approximately 56% of childless adults in our treatment
states and 52% of childless adults in our control states had some form of health insurance. Although the pre-2014
BRFSS does not provide us with the source of insurance, data from the American Community Survey and Current
Population Survey suggest that this population was mostly covered by Medicaid or state-funded program, employersponsored coverage, or self-insurance.

18

indicates that we cannot reject the hypothesis that all pre-2014 interaction coefficients are jointly
equal to zero. Panels 2-5 report the results of the pre-expansion trend test for outcomes related to
access to care, preventive care, health behaviors, and self-assessed health. For the vast majority
of the 25 outcomes we examine, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of equal trends. Overall,
these results, while not definitive, are reassuring evidence that the key assumption of the DD
study design is generally satisfied.

Baseline DD Model: Impact of Medicaid Expansion on Low-Income Adults
Table 1, column 2, presents the full results of our baseline DD model. Results are
presented by category of outcome, with panel 1 presenting results on insurance coverage, panel 2
access to care, panel 3 preventive care, panel 4 health behaviors, and panel 5 self-assessed
health.
Insurance. Table 1, panel 1 shows that the expansion of Medicaid eligibility in 2014
increased the probability that low-income adults had health insurance coverage by 5.4 percentage
points (9%). Subsequent columns show that increases in insurance were experienced by women
(3.4 percentage points or 5%) and men (8.1 percentage points or 14%) and mostly from childless
adults (10.1 percentage points or 17%). There is no statistically significant increase in insurance
coverage for parents.
Access to care. Table 1, panel 2 indicates that the Medicaid expansions increased the
access to care index for the pooled sample, women, and childless adults. Examining the
individual access measures, the expansion increased the proportion of low-income adults who
reported having a personal doctor by 3.4 percentage points (6%). Looking at subgroups, the
impact of the expansion on access to care was strongest for childless adults; for that group, the

19

probability of having a personal doctor increased by 4.1 percentage points (7%), and the
probability of reporting cost as a barrier to care reduced by 3.9 percentage points (11%).
Preventive care. Table 1, panel 3 indicates that the Medicaid expansion significantly
increased the probability of receiving an HIV test in the past year by 2.3 percentage points (5%)
for the pooled sample. This increase came mostly from adult men. There was no detectable
change for the pooled sample in routine checkups, flu shots, dental visits, or cancer screenings.
Among childless adults, we observed a 0.08 increase (5%) in the number of preventive services
received and a 4.1 percentage point (9%) increase in the probability of a dental visit. The cancer
screening index for women, as well as the probability of receiving specific cancer screenings, did
not significantly change for either the pooled sample or any subsamples.
Health behaviors. Table 1, panel 4 indicates that, in virtually all cases for the overall
sample and each subgroup, there was no detectable impact of the expansion on any health
behavior, including heavy drinking, binge drinking, exercise, BMI, or obesity. The one
exception is that smoking participation decreased 1.9 percentage points (6%) among childless
adults. In other words, we find no evidence that the Medicaid expansion led to moral hazard; i.e.
no evidence that the expansions led to increased risky health behaviors.
Self-assessed health. Table 1, panel 5 indicates that the expansion was associated with
small improvements in self-rated general health for the pooled sample (specifically, an increase
of 0.07 point on a 5-point scale, or 2%). For childless adults, we observed larger improvements
in self-rated health. Specifically, there was a 0.14 point (5%) increase in general health, a
decrease in the number of unhealthy days in the past 30 days of 1.27 (10%), a decrease in the
number of days of poor mental health in the past 30 days of 1.06 (13%), a decrease in the
number of days of poor physical health in the past 30 days of 0.84 (11%), and a decrease in the

20

number of days that poor health prevented individuals’ usual activities in the past 30 days of 1.44
(15%). There was no detectable effect of the expansion on the parents’ sample.

Falsification Tests
We conduct falsification tests using two populations whose eligibility for Medicaid was
unaffected by the expansion: low-income adults over age 65 and high-income adults aged 19-64
(defined as above 400% FPL). Results of these falsification tests are provided in Appendix K
(Table A10). As expected, the Medicaid expansion had no impact on the probability of insurance
coverage and little impact on access to care, preventive care utilization, health behaviors, and
self-assessed health for these populations. In other words, these falsification tests yield no
evidence that the improvements seen for the low-income childless adults targeted by the
expansions are due to differences in trends or other potential sources of bias.

Sensitivity Analyses
We examine the sensitivity of our main results to modifications of the sample or model,
presented in Table 2. 17 First, we estimate a logit model for binary outcomes for our pooled
sample, rather than the linear probability model used in our baseline model. The statistical
significance of the results (marginal effects shown in column 1 of Table 2) is quite similar to our
main results, with the exception that the logit model also suggests that the expansion reduced the
probability that cost was a barrier to care by 2.5 percentage points (7%).

17

We conducted tests for parallel trends for each of these alternative specifications. We conclude that for the vast
majority of the outcomes we examine, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of equal trends. Results are available on
request.

21

Second, we estimate our models on our pooled sample without using BRFSS sample
weights. The results (in column 2 of Table 2) are very similar to the main results; the notable
change is that the expansion significantly reduces the probability that cost was a barrier to care
by 2.6 percentage points (7%), reduces the probability of being a current smoker (0.9 percentage
points or 4%), and reduces the probability of engaging in heavy drinking (0.6 percentage points
or 15%). This is consistent with the overall conclusion arising from the main models, that the
expansions improved access to care.
Third, we explore adding a linear state specific time trend. We exclude state-specific
time trends from the main model because they may pick up the effect of the policy and not just
preexisting trends (Wolfers, 2006). The results, in column 3 of Table 2, are remarkably similar
to the main model, with the exception that in the linear state time trend model there is a
significant increase in routine checkups (3.5 percentage points or 6%) and marginally significant
reduction in the probability that cost is a barrier to care (3.2 percentage points or 10%).
Fourth, we define the eligibility of childless adults using low education (less than college
degree) rather than low income. The results, shown in column 4 of Table 2, indicate that the
increase in insurance coverage is smaller for the low-education sample than the low-income
sample (1.2 percentage points compared to 5.4 percentage points), and as a result the access to
care and behavioral changes are smaller and virtually none are statistically significant. This is
consistent with our assessment that in the BRFSS low education is not a strong predictor of low
income and thus of Medicaid eligibility (see footnote 6).
Fifth, we define the eligibility of childless adults using a more liberal income threshold
(less than 200% FPL). As expected, the results (shown in column 5 of Table 2) indicate that the
increase in insurance coverage is smaller for this group than then below-poverty group (3.8

22

percentage points compared to 5.4 percentage points). Consequently, we observe smaller
increases in access to care and little impact on preventive care, health behaviors, and selfassessed health for this population.
Finally, we estimate the DD model using only the six expansion states with the lowest
pre-2014 insurance rates (NV, IL, AR, OH, WA, and OR) because these states are ones where
we expect the impact of Medicaid expansion to be strongest. Results for this model are displayed
in Table 2, column 6. As expected, we found a larger impact of these six strongest Medicaid
expansions on insurance (12.1 percentage point increase), access to care (3.8 percentage point
increase), the likelihood of certain forms of preventive care (routine checkups, flu shots, HIV
tests, and pap tests), certain health behaviors (decreased heavy drinking), and self-assessed
health (0.14 point increase in general health) than for all Medicaid expansions presented in Table
1.
In summary, the finding that the 2014 Medicaid expansions increased access to care and
improved self-rated health is robust to a wide variety of modifications of the sample and the
model specification. The models also consistently yield little evidence of changes in preventive
care and risky health behaviors.
[ Insert Table 2 Here ]

5. Conclusion
The ACA, motivated in part by concern about low use of preventive care and high
engagement in risky health behaviors, sought to improve these outcomes by expanding
Medicaid. This paper provides early evidence on the impact of Medicaid expansions in 30 states
and DC, focusing on the low-income adults who benefited from the expansions. Our particular

23

contribution is that we provide the first evidence of the impact of these expansions on preventive
care and health behaviors.
Results of difference-in-differences (DD) models indicate that the expansions increased
insurance coverage by 9%, the probability of having a personal doctor by 6%, the probability of
getting an HIV test by 5%, and self-assessed health by 2% for low-income adults. Low-income
childless adults, the targets of the expansion, experienced larger increases in insurance coverage
(17%), plus increases in probability of having a personal doctor (7%), decreases in probability of
cost being a barrier to care (11%), increases in the probability of dental visits (9%), larger
improvements in self-assessed health (5%), decreases in number of unhealthy days (-10%), and
decreases in the number of days that poor health prevented usual activities (-15%). It is
appropriate to ask whether these magnitudes are plausible; the increase in coverage for lowincome childless adults (the primary beneficiaries of the expansion) was 10.1 percentage points,
which implies that the effect sizes for compliers (i.e. those who gained actual insurance coverage
– not just eligibility - as a result of the expansion) is roughly 10 times larger than the estimates
above for all low-income childless adults. The implied estimates for preventive care and selfassessed health seem reasonable (roughly 20-60% improvements) while the implied decrease in
days that poor health prevented usual activities are potentially implausibly high (roughly 150%
decrease). This is perhaps especially true given that we examine short-run effects. In
comparison, the Oregon Medicaid experiment found that health insurance raised the probability
that people reported their health as good, very good, or excellent by roughly 25%, increased the
number of days of good physical and mental health by 6-11% and improved the number of days
that poor physical or mental health did not impair usual activities by 8% (Finkelstein et al.,
2012). In summary, we interpret the magnitude of the results for preventive care and self-

24

assessed health as plausible, but are cautious that the effects for healthy days may be implausibly
large.
The fact that these benefits were experienced by low-income individuals suggests that
these expansions reduced health-related disparities, which is a major goal of public health policy
in the United States (e.g. CDC, 2016; US DHHS, 2011; US DHHS 2010b). We confirm the
finding in Sommers et al. (2015) that the 2014 Medicaid expansions improved self-rated
health. 18 This is an important finding, as it shows that the Medicaid expansions led to a
significant increase in the ultimate endpoint of good health. We find little evidence that the
expansions affected risky health behaviors such as smoking, alcohol abuse, lack of exercise, or
obesity. Although the magnitude of the point estimates is somewhat sensitive to changes in the
sample or model specification, the overall conclusions listed above are generally robust.
The finding that the expansions increased insurance coverage and access to care is
consistent with several other recent studies of the 2014 Medicaid expansions (ASPE, 2015;
Sommers et al., 2015, Shartzer, Long, & Anderson, 2015; Sommers, Blendon, & Orav, 2016;
Kaestner et al., 2015; Wherry & Miller, 2016; Courtemanche et al 2016; Frean, Gruber, &
Sommers, 2016).
Perhaps the most relevant comparison is to Wherry & Miller (2016), who studied the
impact of the 2014 Medicaid expansions using the NHIS. We find in the BRFSS that the
Medicaid expansions increased health insurance coverage by 5.4 percentage points for lowincome adults; this lies in between the estimates of 2.9 percentage points in Courtemanche et al.
(2016) and 7.4 percentage points in Wherry and Miller (2016).

18

By combining the results for insurance with those for other outcomes, we are able to calculate elasticities of
health behaviors with respect to insurance; these are provided in Appendix C.

25

Both this paper and Wherry and Miller (2016) find that the expansions had no statistically
significant impact on the probability that affected populations would report that cost was a
barrier to care to their care; the point estimates in both papers are also similar (-1.6 to -2.3
percentage points). Another relevant comparison is to the Oregon Medicaid experiment.
Finkelstein, et al. (2012) estimated that the intention to treat with Medicaid (via the
randomization) increased the probability of having a personal doctor by 16.5%; in comparison,
we find that the 2014 Medicaid expansions increased the probability of having a personal doctor
by 6% for all low-income adults; the latter estimate is smaller than the former because
presumably take-up of the offer of Medicaid in the Oregon experiment was greater than the
increase in eligibility and takeup among all low-income adults in the 2014 expansions.
Our results are consistent with studies of the effects of earlier expansions of health
insurance (i.e., not the 2014 Medicaid expansions but earlier extensions of health insurance,
whether Medicaid or other types) on access to care, preventive care utilization, and health
outcomes. The literature almost unanimously has found that insurance expansions improve
access to medical care (Finkelstein et al., 2012; Miller, 2012). Other studies have also found
positive impacts on preventive care utilization; for example, Finkelstein et al. (2012) examines
data from the Oregon Medicaid experiment and finds that Medicaid expansion led to a higher
probability of receiving cholesterol checks, and blood tests. Whereas we find no significant
impact of the 2014 expansions on mammograms or Pap tests, Finkelstein et al. (2012) find that
the intention to treat in the Oregon Medicaid experiment increased the probability of a
mammogram by 18.4% and the probability of a pap test by 12.5%. Likewise, Van Der Wees,
Zaslavsky, & Ayanian, (2013) exploits the 2006 Massachusetts healthcare reform and find a
significant increase in the usage of Pap tests, colonoscopies, and cholesterol screenings. Miller

26

(2012) also finds that the Massachusetts reform resulted in increased probability of getting an
annual check-up among children.
There are inconsistent results in the literature regarding the effect of health insurance
coverage on health. While some studies find that insurance expansions result in increased selfreported health (Sommers, Baicker, & Epstein, 2012; Finkelstein et al., 2012; Barbaresco,
Courtemanche, & Qi, 2015), others have found little evidence of improved health, perhaps
because of individual heterogeneity in preferences over prevention and seeking of routine care;
e.g. Wehby et al. (2015) argue that genetics may play a role in use of preventive care. Wherry
and Miller (2016), which uses a similar identification strategy (DD models) to study the impact
of the 2014 Medicaid expansion, does not find any significant impact of the expansion on selfassessed health. In contrast, we find that the expansion improved self-rated health and, for
childless adults, reduced the number of days that poor health prevented usual activities.
One might be concerned that, because of provider capacity constraints, increased care for
one group could lead to less care for another. In this case, benefits for low-income childless
adults might crowd out other low-income individuals from care. In our subgroup analyses, we
estimate models for both childless adults and low-income parents. The results indicate that, for
low-income parents (who benefitted less than low-income childless adults from the expansions),
the probability of receiving each type of preventive care was not statistically significant, but the
point estimates are positive. In addition, our falsification test yields no evidence that the
Medicaid expansions reduced the probability that elderly individuals received preventive care.
In other words, there is no evidence of crowd-out.
We also contribute to the literature on the impact of health insurance coverage on ex ante
moral hazard. Compared to insurance for events that have solely financial costs, health

27

insurance may not lead to as much ex ante moral hazard because the insured individual would
still endure the pain and suffering of illness, and pay the opportunity cost of time spent seeking
treatment and recovering (Ehrlich & Becker, 1972). The extent of ex ante moral hazard is
important because it increases the deadweight loss associated with negative externalities that are
due to smoking, sedentary lifestyles, and obesity that operate through the health insurance
system. Specifically, if health insurance coverage leads to more smoking, less exercise, and more
obesity, then the deadweight loss of the externalities in medical care costs from those activities is
even greater (Bhattacharya & Sood, 2011; Bhattacharya & Sood, 2007). Our models yield no
evidence that health insurance coverage increases smoking, increases heavy or binge drinking,
decreases exercise, or increases obesity. Not only are the coefficients statistically insignificant,
the point estimates are quite small; for example, for all low-income adults, the effect of the
expansion on the probability of being a current smoker is -0.6 percentage point, of being a heavy
drinker is -0.4 percentage point, and the probability of exercising is 0.8 percentage point.
Although the 95% confidence intervals do include meaningful effect sizes, we overall find no
evidence of moral hazard in those activities associated with health insurance. (However, the
extent of moral hazard may vary by context or subpopulation and thus there may be behavioral
responses that we do not observe.)
The previous empirical literature is mixed in whether it finds evidence of such moral
hazard. Some of the earlier studies also examined the effect of Medicaid. The randomized
experiment in Oregon found that Medicaid coverage had no statistically significant impact on the
probability of obesity, although the confidence intervals were very wide (Baicker et al., 2013). In
contrast, two studies that exploit the 1990s state Medicaid expansions as natural experiments find

28

evidence that health insurance coverage raises BMI (Kelly & Markowitz, 2009; Bhattacharya &
Sood, 2011).
There is also evidence on ex ante moral hazard for health insurance programs other than
Medicaid. Barbaresco, Courtemanche, and Qi (2015) examine the effect of the ACA’s dependent
care provision and estimate that health insurance coverage lowers BMI but increases alcohol
abuse. Courtemanche and Zapata (2014) examine the Massachusetts healthcare reform and find
that health insurance coverage reduced BMI but did not affect smoking or physical activity.
Dave and Kaestner (2009) examine those who newly qualify for Medicare and find that,
controlling for employment status and number of doctor visits, gaining Medicare coverage
reduced vigorous physical exercise and increased daily drinking and smoking, all among men.
Other research on Medicare receipt confirmed a reduction in physical activity but found no clear
effect on alcohol consumption or smoking (De Preux, 2011). The RAND Health Insurance
Experiment found no evidence that generosity of health insurance (i.e. the intensive rather than
extensive margin of coverage) had an impact on weight, physical activity, smoking, or alcohol
consumption (Newhouse & The Insurance Experiment Group, 1993; Brook et al., 1983). The
findings from this paper do not fully resolve this debate, but do add further weight to the body of
research that finds no evidence that health insurance coverage leads to ex ante moral hazard in
the form of increased risky health behaviors.
Comparisons with the earlier literature are complicated by the fact that the population of
low-income childless adults treated by the 2014 Medicaid expansions are quite different from
those treated by the ACA’s young adult mandate, the 2006 Massachusetts health care reform,
Medicare, and the RAND Health Insurance Experiment. The income effect of insurance access
presumably is larger for the relatively lower-income group that we study. However, it is also

29

possible that because low-income populations have greater access to charity care that their
quantity of care demanded may not rise as much as otherwise.
We acknowledge the limitations of our analysis. We have eight quarters (two years) of
data from after the expansion, so what we measure are the short-run effects of the expansions.
There is clearly interest in the short-run effects, even after only two years, from other reforms of
health insurance (see, e.g., Finkelstein et al., 2012, which concerns first-year effects). This is
especially the case for the ACA Medicaid expansions, as early evidence is useful in the ongoing
debates among the states that have thus far not expanded Medicaid. The short-run nature of our
estimates makes the finding of improved access to care, increases in certain preventive care, and
improvements in self-assessed health, more striking. Future studies should estimate the longerrun effects of the 2014 Medicaid expansions, to see whether the effects dissipate, are maintained,
or increase over time.
A related limitation is that individuals living in treatment states who were interviewed
early in 2014 will have spent relatively less time treated by the expansion, while those
interviewed late in 2014 will have spent almost the full year treated by the expansion. This is
relevant because a subset of the outcomes we examine are based on BRFSS questions that ask
about experiences in the past year (specifically: cost as a barrier to care, and each of the
preventive care measures). All of the respondents in the 2015 data have spent an entire year
treated by the expansions, but the partial exposure in 2014 may mean that we underestimate the
effects of Medicaid expansion on the subset of outcomes that are based on the past 12 months.
This is far less of an issue for the outcomes we examine that are based on questions about the
past month (drinking, smoking, exercise, self-assessed health) or the moment of the interview
(health insurance coverage, have a personal doctor, weight).

30

The BRFSS is a repeated cross-section, so we cannot observe changes in specific
individuals’ behavior after gaining health insurance the way we could in a panel dataset. The
income reported in BRFSS is categorical rather than continuous, so we may misclassify the
Medicaid eligibility of some childless adults. Prior to 2014, BRFSS does not publish the source
of individuals’ health insurance, so we are unable to observe which low-income childless adults
are covered by Medicaid after the expansion. However, prior studies of the 2014 expansions
have verified that the insurance gains among low-income childless adults are due to Medicaid
(Sommers, et al., 2015; Frean, Gruber, & Sommers, 2016; Courtemanche et al., 2016). Despite
these limitations, this paper provides important early information about the effects of the 2014
Medicaid expansions on preventive care, health behaviors, and self-assessed health.

Figure 1. Trends in Insurance Rates, Expansion vs. Non-Expansion States

Notes: Source is BRFSS 2010-2015. Sample is restricted to include only non-elderly, <100% FPL adults. Data are
adjusted by BRFSS sample weight. See Table A1 for states in expansion and non-expansion categories. The vertical
lines indicate Q4 of 2013 and Q1 of 2014; thus, ACA Medicaid expansions took place in between the two vertical
lines. See Appendix C for graphs for the remaining outcomes.

Notes: Author estimates based on BRFSS 2010-15. In columns 1-2, sample is restricted to include only non-elderly, <100% FPL adults. In columns 3-4, sample
includes only non-elderly, <100% FPL women. Columns 5-6 includes only non-elderly, <100% FPL men. Columns 7-8 includes only non-elderly, <100% FPL
adults without children below 18. Columns 9-10 includes only non-elderly, <100% FPL adults with children below 18. The cancer screenings regressions are
limited to women above age 21, and the mammogram regression is limited to women over age 50. State-clustered standard errors are in parentheses for DD
estimates. All regressions also control for gender, marital status, household size, race, unemployment status, age, education, state unemployment rate, whether
the respondent was part of the cell-phone sample, state-fixed effects, and quarter/year-fixed effects. Data is adjusted by BRFSS sample weights. See Table A1 for
states in expansion and non-expansion categories. Columns 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 display variable’s mean value for the expansion group in 2010-13, adjusted by
BRFSS sample weight. Standard deviations are in parentheses for pre-treatment means. Larger fonts indicate summary measures and smaller fonts indicate
detailed outcomes. See Appendix B for variable definitions. *** Significant at the 1 percent level, ** Significant at the 5 percent level, * Significant at the 10

Appendix A: Models Excluding Mild Expansion States
In order to focus on treatment and control groups of states that are as “clean” as possible,
we first drop nine states plus DC that had partial eligibility for low-income adults before 2014
and thus experienced what we term only “mild” or “substantial” (but not full) expansion in 2014.
Excluded states include three states plus DC that that enacted the ACA Medicaid expansion in
2011-12 (CA, CT, MN, DC), five states that partially expanded Medicaid to childless adults
before 2014 (DE, HI, MA, NY, and VT), and one1 non-expansion state that made
comprehensive insurance coverage available to childless adults through alternate programs (WI).
Next, we implement a specification in which we drop just the four states plus DC that had the
strongest Medicaid expansions prior to 2014, and thus mild expansion in 2014. These include
DC, DE, MA, NY, and VT; this categorization corresponds to Wherry and Miller (2016). Our
final categorizations of states in these specifications are displayed in Table A1. States in column
1 are considered “expansion” states, those in column 4 are considered “non-expansion” states,
and those in columns 2 and 3 are excluded from analysis successively.
Results from the models excluding substantial and mild expansion states are displayed in
Table A2. As expected, the impact of Medicaid expansion is stronger on these “clean” groups of
expansion states, in terms of both magnitude and statistical significant of coefficients. In the
model that excludes both mild and substantial expansion states, Table A2, panel 1 shows that the
expansion of Medicaid eligibility in 2014 increased the probability that low-income adults had
health insurance coverage by 8.9 percentage points (15%). The increase in insurance rate for
childless adults was even larger (14.0 percentage points or 25%). In the model that excludes only
mild expansion states, Table A2, panel 1 shows that expansion of Medicaid eligibility increased
the probability that all low-income adults had insurance by 6.6 percentage points (11%) and that

43

low-income childless adults had insurance by 11.4 percentage points (19%). In both models, the
impact of Medicaid expansion on the remaining outcomes is similar to our main model, with
improvements in access to care, improvements in certain forms of preventive care such as HIV
tests and dentist visits, little impact on health behaviors, and significant improvement in selfassessed health.

Note: This table shows the state classification as regards Medicaid eligibility for adults. These are mutually
exclusive lists of states. In our primary specification in the main paper, states in columns 1-3 are considered
“expansion” states, and those in column 4 are considered “non-expansion” states. In the sensitivity checks
in Appendix A, states in column 1 are considered “expansion” states, those in column 4 are considered
“non-expansion” states, and those in columns 2-3 are successively excluded from analysis.
1
The Medicaid expansion became effective in January 2014 for all expansion states except for the
following: Alaska (September 2015), Indiana (February 2015), Louisiana (July 2016), Michigan (April
2014), Montana (January 2016), New Hampshire (August 2014), and Pennsylvania (January 2015). Since
our data go through 2015, we identified those states that expanded in after January 2014 but before January
2016 as expansion states only in the quarters after the expansion was implemented.
2
Since 2000, Arizona offered Medicaid-equivalent benefits to childless adults with incomes below 100% FPL
through a Section 1115 waiver program. However, the state closed the program to new enrollees in July 2011
(Kaiser Family Foundation, 2015) and consequently experienced a significant expansion for childless adults in 2014.
3
Arkansas operated a limited-benefit premium-assistance program for childless adults who worked for small
uninsured employers (ARHealthNetworks waiver) (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2015) prior to the ACA.
4
Colorado had only very limited eligibility before 2014. Adults with income up to 10% FPL were eligible for
Medicaid as of May 2012, and enrollment was capped to 10,000 adults (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2015).
5
Under the IowaCare program, childless adults with income below 200% FPL were eligible for public health
insurance since 2005. However, IowaCare provided limited services in a limited network, and so low-income adults
in Iowa effectively underwent substantial expansion in coverage in 2014 (Damiano et al., 2013).

California, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Washington elected to enact the ACA
Medicaid expansion in 2010-11. However, New Jersey’s early expansion only extended to 23% FPL while the other
five states extended at least until 50% FPL (Sommers et al., 2013). Also, Washington’s early expansion was limited
to prior state plan enrollees (Sommers et al., 2013). Therefore we treat New Jersey and Washington as full 2014
expansion states.
7
In 2008, Oregon enacted a small Medicaid expansion for low-income adults through lottery drawings from a
waitlist. However, less than one-third of the 90,000 people on the waitlist were selected to apply for Medicaid in
2008 (Baicker et al., 2013) and so the 2014 expansion represented a significant increase in eligibility for low-income
adults.
8
In Hawaii, childless adults with incomes up to 100% FPL were eligible for the state’s QUEST Medicaid managed
care waiver program (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2015).

9

Although Wisconsin was not an ACA expansion state, the state received federal approval to offer Medicaid to
childless adults below 100% FPL through the BadgerCare program as of 2009 (Gates & Rudowitz, 2014).
10
In Delaware, childless adults with incomes up to 100% FPL were eligible for Medicaid benefits through the
Diamond State Health Plan waiver (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2015).
11
Massachusetts implemented reforms to expand insurance coverage to low-income adults in 2006 (Kaiser Family
Foundation, 2015).
12
In New York, childless adults up to 78% FPL were eligible for the Medicaid (Home Relief) waiver program and
childless adults up to 100% FPL were eligible for the Family Health Plus waiver program (Heberlein et al., 2011).
13
In Vermont, childless adults up to 150% FPL were eligible for Medicaid-equivalent coverage through the
Vermont Health Access Plan waiver program (Heberlein et al., 2011).

Notes: Author estimates based on BRFSS 2010-15. In columns 2 and 6, sample is restricted to include only non-elderly, <100% FPL adults. Columns 4 and 8
include only non-elderly, <100% FPL without children below 18. The cancer screenings regressions are limited to women above age 21, and the mammogram
regression is limited to women over age 50. State-clustered standard errors are in parentheses for DD estimates. All regressions also control for gender, marital
status, household size, race, unemployment status, age, education, state unemployment rate, whether the respondent was part of the cell-phone sample, state-fixed
effects, and quarter/year-fixed effects. Data is adjusted by BRFSS sample weights. See Table A1 for states in expansion and non-expansion categories. Columns
1-4 exclude “substantial” and “mild” expansion states listed in Table A1, columns 2-3. Columns 5-8 exclude only “mild” expansion states listed in Table A1,
column 3. Columns 1, 3, 5, and 7 display variable’s mean value for the expansion group in 2010-13, adjusted by BRFSS sample weight. Standard deviations are
in parentheses for pre-treatment means. Larger fonts indicate summary measures and smaller fonts indicate detailed outcomes. See Appendix B for variable
definitions. *** Significant at the 1 percent level, ** Significant at the 5 percent level, * Significant at the 10 percent level.

Appendix B: Variable Definitions
Below, we describe in detail each outcome we analyze, which fall into the categories of:
insurance coverage, access to care, preventive care, health behaviors, and self-assessed health.
For categories with multiple measures, we construct an overall index and also examine the
individual components as outcomes.

The text of the questions is from the BRFSS

questionnaires.
•

Have Insurance: Individuals were asked, “Do you have any kind of healthcare coverage,
including health insurance, prepaid plans such as HMOs, or government plans such as
Medicare or Indian Health Service?” Those who responded “Yes” were coded as “1,”
those who responded “No” were coded as “0,” and those who responded “Don’t
know/not sure” or “Refused” were coded as missing.

•

Good access to care index: We constructed this variable as a binary variable equal to 1 if
the individual either responded “no” when asked if cost was a barrier to care or “yes”
when asked if they had a primary care physician. The outcome was coded as 0 if the
individual responded “yes” when asked if cost was a barrier to care and “no” when asked
if they had a primary care physician.
o Have personal doctor: Individuals were asked, “Do you have one person you
think of as your personal doctor or healthcare provider?” We coded the variable
as 1 if the response was either “Yes, only one” or “Yes, more than one,” and
coded it as 0 if the response was “No.” Those who responded “Don’t know/not
sure” or “Refused” were coded as missing.
o Cost a barrier to care: Individuals were asked, “Was there a time in the past 12
months when you needed to see a doctor but could not because of cost?” Those

50

who responded “Yes” were coded as “1,” those who responded “No” were coded
as “0,” and those who responded “Don’t know/not sure” or “Refused” were coded
as missing.
•

Number of preventive services received: We constructed this index as the sum of the four
components below. The index can theoretically range from 0 (for someone who received
none of the four services below) to 4 (for someone who received all of the services
below). Because one component of the index (dentist visits) is only available for even
years, our models for this index outcome incorporate only even years of BRFSS data.
o Routine checkup: Individuals were asked, “About how long has it been since you
last visited a doctor for a routine checkup? (A routine checkup is a general
physical exam, not an exam for a specific injury, illness, or condition.)” Those
who responded “Within past year” were coded as 1. Those who responded
“Within past 2 years ([more than] 1 year but less than 2 years ago),” “Within past
5 years ([more than] 2 years but less than 5 years ago),” “5 or more years ago,” or
“Never” were coded as 0. Those who responded “Don’t know/not sure” or
“Refused” were coded as missing.
o Flu shot: Individuals were asked, “During the past 12 months, have you had
either a flu shot or a flu vaccine that was sprayed in your nose?” Those who
responded “Yes” were coded as “1,” those who responded “No” were coded as
“0,” and those who responded “Don’t know/not sure” or “Refused” were coded as
missing.
o HIV test: Individuals were asked, “Have you ever been tested for HIV? Do not
count tests you may have had as part of a blood donation. Include testing fluid

51

from your mouth.” Those who responded “Yes” were coded as “1,” those who
responded “No” were coded as “0,” and those who responded “Don’t know/not
sure” or “Refused” were coded as missing.
o Dentist visit: Individuals were asked, “How long has it been since you last visited
a dentist or a dental clinic for any reason? Include visits to dental specialists, such
as orthodontists.” Those who responded “Within past year” were coded as 1.
Those who responded “Within past 2 years ([more than] 1 year but less than 2
years ago),” “Within past 5 years ([more than] 2 years but less than 5 years ago),”
“5 or more years ago,” or “Never” were coded as 0. Those who responded “Don’t
know/not sure” or “Refused” were coded as missing.
•

Received any cancer screenings: We constructed this index only for women using the
three components below. The variable was coded as 1 if the individual responded “yes”
to having received any of the cancer screenings below in the past year and as 0 if the
individual responded “no” for all of the cancer screenings below in the past year. It was
coded as missing for individuals who had missing data for all three screenings.
o Clinical breast exam: Women were asked the questions, “A clinical breast exam
is when a doctor, nurse, or other health professional feels the breast for lumps.
Have you had a clinical breast exam?” and “How long has it been since your last
breast exam?” We coded our outcome variable as 1 if the individual responded
“yes” to the first question and “within past year” to the second question. We
coded our outcome variable as 0 if the individual responded “no” or “don’t
know/not sure” to the first question or responded “yes” to the first question and
“within past 2 years ([more than] 1 year but less than 2 years ago),” “within past 3

52

years ([more than] 2 years but less than 3 years ago),” “within past 5 years ([more
than] 3 years but less than 5 years ago),” “5 or more years ago,” or “Don’t
know/not sure” to the second question. We coded our outcome variable as
missing if the response to either question was “Refused” or if the individual was
not a woman above 21.
o Pap test: Women were asked the questions, “A Pap test is a test for cancer of the
cervix. Have you ever had a Pap test?” and “How long has it been since you had
your last Pap test?” We coded our outcome variable as 1 if the individual
responded “yes” to the first question and “within past year” to the second
question. We coded our outcome variable as 0 if the individual responded “no” to
the first question or responded “yes” to the first question and “within past 2 years
([more than] 1 year but less than 2 years ago),” “within past 3 years ([more than]
2 years but less than 3 years ago),” “within past 5 years ([more than] 3 years but
less than 5 years ago),” “5 or more years ago,” or “Don’t know/not sure” to the
second question. We coded our outcome variable as missing if the response to
either question was “Refused” or if the individual was not a woman above 21.
o Mammogram: Women were asked the questions, “A mammogram is an x-ray of
each breast to look for breast cancer. Have you ever had a mammogram?” and
“How long has it been since you had your last mammogram?” We coded our
outcome variable as 1 if the individual responded “yes” to the first question and
“within past year” to the second question. We coded our outcome variable as 0 if
the individual responded “no” to the first question or responded “yes” to the first
question and “within past 2 years ([more than] 1 year but less than 2 years ago),”

53

“within past 3 years ([more than] 2 years but less than 3 years ago),” “within past
5 years ([more than] 3 years but less than 5 years ago),” “5 or more years ago,”
“Don’t know/not sure,” or “Refused” to the second question. We coded our
outcome variable as missing if the response to the first question was “Refused” or
“Don’t know/not sure,” or if the individual was not a woman above 50.
•

Unhealthy behavior index: We constructed this index using the components below. The
variable was coded as 1 if the individual responded “yes” to being a current smoker,
engaging in heavy drinking, or engaging in binge drinking, or “no” to having exercised in
the past month, or if their reported height/weight qualifies as overweight/obese. The
variable was coded as 0 if the individual is not obese and responded “no” to being a
current smoker, engaging in heavy drinking, and engaging in binge drinking, and “yes”
to having exercised in the past month. It was coded as missing for individuals who had
missing data for all three variables.
o Current smoker: We constructed this using the BRFSS-calculated variable
“Adults who are current smokers.” Those who currently smoke either every day
or some days were coded as 1, and those who formerly smoked or never smoked
were coded as 0. Those who responded “don’t know/not sure” or “refused” were
coded as missing.
o Heavy drinking: We constructed this using the BRFSS-calculated variable
“Heavy drinkers (adult men having more than two drinks per day and adult
women having more than one drink per day)” during the past 30 days. Those who
engaged in heavy drinking were coded as 1, and those who did not were coded as

54

0. Those who responded “don’t know/not sure” or “refused” were coded as
missing.
o Binge drinking: We constructed this using the BRFSS calculated variable “Binge
drinkers (males having five or more drinks on one occasion, females having four
or more drinks on one occasion)” during the past 30 days. Those who engaged in
binge drinking were coded as 1, and those who did not were coded as 0. Those
who responded “don’t know/not sure” or “refused” were coded as missing.
o Exercise: Individuals were asked, “During the past month, other than your regular
job, did you participate in any physical activities or exercises such as running,
calisthenics, golf, gardening, or walking for exercise?” Those who responded
“Yes” were coded as “1,” those who responded “No” were coded as “0,” and
those who responded “Don’t know/not sure” or “Refused” were coded as missing.
o BMI (x100): This was a BRFSS-calculated variable using individuals’ reported
height and weight. BRFSS divided weight by the square of height, and so the
value has two implied decimal places. Those who reported height or weight as
“Don’t know/not sure” or “Refused” were coded as missing.
o Obese: We used the BRFSS-calculated BMI to construct this variable. Those
whose BMI(x100) was calculated as greater than or equal to 3,000 but less than
9,999 were coded as 1. Those whose BMI(x100) was calculated as less than 2,500
were coded as 0. Those whose BMI was missing were coded as missing.
•

General Health: Individuals were asked, “Would you say that in general your health is
excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?” We coded “Excellent” as 5, “Very good” as 4,

55

“Good” as 3, “Fair” as 2, and “Poor” as 1. Those who responded “Don’t know/not sure”
or “Refused” were coded as missing.
•

Number of unhealthy days: We constructed this index by taking the sum of the two
components below and setting the max to 30.
o Number of days mental health not good: Individuals were asked, “Now thinking
about your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with
emotions, for how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not
good?” This variable can theoretically range from 0 to 30. Those who responded
“Don’t know/not sure” or “Refused” were coded as missing.
o Number of days physical health not good: Individuals were asked, “Now thinking
about your physical health, which includes physical illness and injury, for how
many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good?” This
variable can theoretically range from 0 to 30. Those who responded “Don’t
know/not sure” or “Refused” were coded as missing.

•

Number of days poor health prevented usual activities: Individuals were asked, “During
the past 30 days, for about how many days did poor physical or mental health keep you
from doing your usual activities, such as self-care, work, or recreation?” This variable
can theoretically range from 0 to 30. Those who responded “Don’t know/not sure” or
“Refused” were coded as missing.

Notes: Source is BRFSS 2010-2015. Sample is restricted to include only non-elderly, <100% FPL adults. Data are
adjusted by BRFSS sample weight. See Table 1 for states in expansion and non-expansion categories. The vertical
lines indicate Q4 of 2013 and Q1 of 2014; thus, Medicaid expansions took place in between the two vertical lines.
Data on dentist visits, cancer screenings index, clinical breast exams, Pap tests, and mammograms was not
available for most states in odd years, so we drop the years 2011, 2013, and 2015 only for these outcomes.
Consequently, the number of preventive services received index (which sums dentist visits, flu shots, HIV tests, and
routine checkups) drops for all groups in odd years because data for one component of the index (dentist visits) is
not available in these years.

Appendix D: Dichotomized General Health Outcome

Because the outcome “general health” is measured on an ordinal 5‐point scale, the linear
model estimated in our main paper implies that the distance between a 1 and a 2 (poor vs. fair
health) has the same meaning as the distance between a 4 and 5 (very good vs. excellent). To
better assess changes in self-assessed health, we dichotomized the “general health” index into a
series of indicators: “Good or better,” which equals 1 if the “general health” value is 3 or higher;
“Very good or better,” which equals 1 if the “general health” value is 4 or higher; and
“Excellent,” which equals 1 if the “general health” value is 5. We estimated separate models for
each of these three outcomes.
Results are displayed in Table A3, and corresponding trends graphs are displayed in
Figure A1. For the pooled sample, there was a 2.2 percentage point increase in the probability of
reporting “good” or better health (3% rise from pre-expansion level), a 2.8 percentage point (9%)
increase in the probability of reporting “very good” or better health, and a 1.8 percentage point
(14%) increase in the probability of reporting “excellent” health. For childless adults, there was a
5.4 percentage point (9%) increase in the probability of reporting “good” or better health, a 3.6
percentage point (11%) increase in the probability of reporting “very good” or better health, and
2.0 percentage point increase (15%) in the probability of reporting “excellent” health. This
suggests that the observed increases in the linear general health outcome in the main paper came
primarily from increases in reports of “good,” “very good,” and “excellent” health.

Appendix E: Wild Cluster Bootstrap-t Procedure
In our main DD model, we cluster standard errors by state. However, standard asymptotic
tests may over-reject the null hypothesis with a small number of clusters. We assess whether our
results are robust to an alternative method of conducting inference. Following an example in
Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller (2008), we use as our left-hand variable the mean of each
outcome variable calculated at year-quarter level for treatment and control groups. This reduces
the number of observations to 44, and we cluster at year-quarter level of 22 clusters. Our righthand side variables are an indicator for expansion, an indicator for the period following the start
of Medicaid expansion (January 2014 and onwards), and an interaction of these. A similar
method was used in Akosa Antwi, Moriya, and Simon (2013).
As shown in Table A4, using the wild cluster bootstrap-t procedure does not affect the
significance of the majority of our results. For the sample of all low-income adults, we observe
statistically significant increases in insurance, access to care, and self-assessed general health,
with little impact on preventive care and health behaviors. For the childless adults sample, we
observe larger increases in insurance, access to care, and self-assessed health. The only notable
difference in the wild cluster bootstrap-t procedure is that dentist visits are not significant for
childless adults (whereas we observed a significant increase in dentist visits in our main DD
model), and we observe a significant 4.1 percentage point increase in probability of receiving a
routine checkup (whereas routine checkups were insignificant in our main DD model). Overall,
using this alternative form of inference testing does not change the significance of our results.

Notes: Author estimates based on BRFSS 2010-15. Dependent variable is mean (weighted by BRFSS sample
weights) of outcome calculated at year-quarter level for treatment and control states. Number of observations is 44.
Explanatory variables are an indicator for the quarters after the expansion, an indicator for expansion status, and an
interaction of these two terms. We perform wild cluster bootstrap-t test with 999 replications and cluster on yearquarter, following examples in Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller (2008) and Akosa Antwi, Moriya, and Simon (2013).
In columns 1-2, sample is restricted to include only non-elderly, <100% FPL adults. Columns 3-4 include only nonelderly, <100% FPL without children below 18. The cancer screenings regressions are limited to women above age
21, and the mammogram regression is limited to women over age 50. See Table A1 for states in expansion and nonexpansion categories. Larger fonts indicate summary measures and smaller fonts indicate detailed outcomes. See
Appendix B for variable definitions. *** Significant at the 1 percent level, ** Significant at the 5 percent level, *

Appendix F: Instrumental Variables Model
We estimated a set of instrumental variables (IV) models with insurance as the binary
endogenous variable and the DD interaction “Treat X Post” as the instrument. The IV models
suggest that insurance caused a significant increase in access to care, certain forms of preventive
care (HIV tests for all low-income adults and dentist visits for childless adults), and self-assessed
health and that insurance did not result in any significant change in risky health behaviors. These
results confirm our findings in our main DD model. Also, the magnitudes of the IV estimates
largely fall in line with the implied elasticities of the DD approach, detailed in Appendix H.

Appendix G: Adjustments for Multiple Inference
In our main analysis, we examine 25 different outcomes. We fit 25 models and then use ttests to determine whether the DD coefficient is significantly different from zero in each of the
equations. One potential issue with this analysis is that the errors of each equation may be
correlated, and the t-tests may not be independent of each other. The probability that we reject
the null incorrectly on at least one of the 25 is higher than the nominal significance level of the
test. To account for multiple hypothesis bias, we use Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR)
methods that allow us to use a single variance-covariance matrix across multiple seemingly
unrelated regression equations (Zellner, 1962). Following examples in Finkelstein, et al., (2012),
Autor and Houseman (2010), and Kling, Liebman, and Katz (2007), we use F-tests to evaluate
the compound null hypothesis that all coefficients within a given category of outcomes –
insurance, access to care, preventive care, health behaviors, and self-assessed health – are jointly
equal to zero.
Results from the SUR analysis are displayed in Table A6. The reported p-values
represent category-wise error rates, i.e. represent the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis
of at least one type I error in the category. We perform this test individually for the four
categories that have multiple outcomes (rows 1-4). We also perform this test for all 25 outcomes
together (results in row 5). Stacking the data and using SUR estimation across outcomes, we
reject the hypothesis that the 25 coefficients are jointly equal to zero (P<0.001).

Notes: Author estimates based on BRFSS 2010-15. We estimate a set of stacked regression models and use F-tests
to evaluate the compound null hypothesis that all coefficients within a given category of outcomes – insurance,
access to care, preventive care (ignoring the results that were run on different samples, including cancer screenings
index, clinical breast exams, Pap tests, and mammograms), health behaviors, and self-assessed health – are jointly
equal to zero.

Appendix H: Implied Elasticities of Health Behaviors with Respect to Insurance
We estimate that the Medicaid expansion resulted in a 5.4-percentage-point increase in
the probability of having insurance coverage for low-income adults. The pre-2014 insurance rate
for this population in treatment states was 62%, so our estimate implies that after controlling for
other factors, the Medicaid expansion caused the insurance rate to rise from 62% to 67%. This
represents a 9% rise in the insurance rate.
By combining the results for insurance with those for other outcomes, we are able to
calculate elasticities of health behaviors with respect to insurance, assuming that insurance
coverage is the sole pathway through which reform changes these outcomes. 19 To account for the
fact that the sample size may be different for each outcome (due to missing data for certain
individuals or certain years), we recalculate the DD estimate on insurance for each outcome,
using only those individuals for whom the outcome variable is not missing. We use this revised
estimate to calculate an elasticity for each outcome.
For example, for individuals with non-missing access to care data, the Medicaid
expansion caused a 5.5-percentage-point increase in the probability of having insurance as well
as a 1.7-percentage-point increase in the probability of having good access to care. This implies
that 31% (1.7/5.5=0.31) of the newly insured received routine checkups in the past year. Table
A7 presents elasticities with respect to insurance for all the statistically significant binary
outcomes. In general, these outcomes are relatively inelastic with respect to health insurance; the
most responsive outcome is personal doctor, which has an elasticity with respect to health

This would not be the case, for example, if the option to acquire insurance coverage in the future causes ex ante
moral hazard—that is, if uninsured individuals, knowing that they can enroll in Medicaid should they fall ill, engage
in more risky behaviors. In this case, even individuals who are uninsured changed their health behaviors in response
to the expansion. We set aside that possibility in these calculations, but note that it would make our elasticities
smaller.

insurance of 0.62. The least responsive of these outcomes is good access to care for childless
adults, which has an elasticity with respect to health insurance of 0.23.

Notes: Source: Author estimates based on BRFSS 2010-15. Standard deviations are in parentheses. Sample is restricted to include only non-elderly, <100% FPL
adults. N=74,423 for the expansion group and N=77,140 for the non-expansion group. However, because of missing data (respondents either refused to answer,
responded “unsure,” or were not asked the question), the number of valid observations varies for each outcome. Data is adjusted by BRFSS sample weights. See
Table 1 for states in expansion and non-expansion categories. *** Difference significant at 1% level, **Significant at 5% level, * Significant at 1% level. See
Appendix B for variable definitions.

Appendix J: Tests for Parallel Trends
We test for equality of the pre-expansion trends using an event-study method. We
estimate regressions that interact the treatment group dummy with year dummy variables
(omitting 2013 as the reference year). We jointly test the null hypothesis that all pre-2014
interaction terms are equal to 0 using an F test.
Results are presented in Table A9. The first two columns of Table A9 show the
coefficients on the interaction of the expansion states with the indicator variables for 2015
(column 1) and 2014 (column 2); these represent the policy effects against which to judge the
prior trends. For the vast majority of the 25 outcomes we examine, we cannot reject the null
hypothesis of equal trends. There are three outcomes, however, for which we reject that all pre2014 interactions are jointly equal to zero: cost a barrier to care (p=0.04), clinical breast exam
(p=0.02), and exercise (p=0.03). However, the first outcome was increasing and the next two
outcomes were declining in the expansion states relative to the control states, which is the
opposite of the expected treatment effect; thus, any violation of the parallel trends assumption
appears to bias the DD model against finding a beneficial effect of Medicaid expansion on these
outcomes. Overall, these results, while not definitive, are reassuring evidence that the key
assumption of the DD study design is generally satisfied.

Notes: Author estimates based on BRFSS 2010-15. Sample is restricted to include only non-elderly, <100% FPL adults. All regressions also control for
gender, marital status, household size, race, unemployment status, age, education, state unemployment rate, whether the respondent was part of the cellphone sample, state-fixed effects, and quarter/year-fixed effects. Data is adjusted by BRFSS sample weights. See Table A1 for states in expansion and
non-expansion categories. *** Significant at the 1 percent level, ** Significant at the 5 percent level, * Significant at the 10 percent level.

For the outcomes “Number of preventive services received,” “Dentist visit,” “Received any cancer screenings index,” “Clinical breast exam,” “Pap
test,” and “Mammogram,” data was available for only even-number years. For these five outcomes, the base year is 2012; column (4) represents
“Expansion Dummy X Year 2010”; and column (5) represents “Expansion Dummy X Year 2008.”

Appendix K: Falsification Tests
We conduct falsification tests using two populations whose eligibility for Medicaid was
unaffected by the expansion: low-income adults over age 65 and high-income adults aged 19-64
(defined as above 400% FPL). Table A10, panel 2 shows that the expansions were associated
with a small (1.3%) decrease in the access to care index for the elderly, although we also find it
led to an increase in probability of having a personal doctor for the high-income population,
which is marginally significant at the 10% level. Panel 3 shows that the expansions had no
impact on preventive care for these populations, with the exception of an increase in probability
of receiving an HIV test for the over-65 population (0.05 percentage points or 31%) and small
increase in probability of receiving a routine checkup (1.3 percentage points or 2%) for the highincome population. Panel 4 shows that the Medicaid expansions were not associated with
changes in health behaviors in these populations, with the exception that smoking increased
among the over-65 population (3.9 percentage points or 33%) and there was a slight increase in
the unhealthy behavior index (0.01 percentage points or 1%) for the high-income population. In
Table A10, panel 5, most of the outcomes related to health status are not significantly affected,
except that general health decreased for both populations, which is the opposite sign of the
expected effect of the expansion on treated individuals. In summary, the results found for the
populations affected by the Medicaid expansions are not mirrored in these populations that were
unaffected by the expansions.

Notes: Author estimates based on BRFSS 2010-15. In columns 1-2, sample is restricted to include only <100% FPL
adults age 65 and older. In columns 3-4, sample includes only adults aged 19-64 >400% FPL. The cancer screenings
regressions are limited to women above age 21, and the mammogram regression is limited to women over age 50.
State-clustered standard errors are in parentheses for DD estimates. All regressions also control for gender, marital
status, household size, race, unemployment status, age, education, state unemployment rate, whether the respondent
was part of the cell-phone sample, state-fixed effects, and quarter/year-fixed effects. Data is adjusted by BRFSS
sample weights. See Table A1 for states in expansion and non-expansion categories. Columns 1 and 3 display
variable’s mean value for the expansion group in 2010-13, adjusted by BRFSS sample weight. Standard deviations
are in parentheses for pre-treatment means. Larger fonts indicate summary measures and smaller fonts indicate
detailed outcomes. See Appendix B for variable definitions. *** Significant at the 1 percent level, ** Significant at
the 5 percent level, * Significant at the 10 percent level.
