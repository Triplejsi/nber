The Postwar Evolution of Computer Prices

ABSTRACT

This study constructs new hedonic price indexes for electronic computers
covering the period 1951—84. Regressions are estimated for four data sets, two
used in previous studies by G. Chow and E. Dulberger, and two new data sets
used for the first time in this study. Coverage is limited to mainframes until
the late 1970s, but includes both "super—mini" computers and personal computers
in the 1980s. The end result is a price index that exhibits a 1951. index number,
on a base 1984 100, of 147,692, implying an annual rate of price change over
the 33 years of —19.8 percent.
Price changes for personal computer (PC) processors during the 1982—86
period appear to have been similar to those for mainframe computers during the

1977—84 period, in the range of —20 to —25 percent per year. 'Evidence fort PC
peripheral equipment is limited to 1984—86 and indicates a faster rate of price
decline than for processors, particularly if the increasing availability of "clones"
is taken into account.

The paper places considerable emphasis on problems of weighting price
indexes for computers together with price indexes for other types of "Office,
Computing, and Accounting Machinery" (OCA) and other types of producers'
durable equipment (PDE). The methodology used to construct the implicit price
deflators in the National rncome and Product Accounts, with a fixed 1982 base
year, leads to a significant downward bias in the implicit OCA and PDE deflators
after 1982, and an upward bias prior to 1982. A particularly disturbing aspect of
the present national accounts is a spurious rise in the implicit OCA deflator of
157 percent between 1957 and 1971, despite the fact that its computer component
exhibits a price decline and its non—computer component increases by only 8
percent. The paper recommends adoption of a chain—linked Laspeyres index
number for any price index aggregate that includes computers. A properly
weighted PDE deflator, using our computer price index, declines relative to the
official implicit PDE deflator by 0.74 percent per year during 1957—72 and 0.87
percent per year during 1972—84.

I. INTRODUCTION

It is now 35 years since the first delivery of the UNIVAC I electronic
computer, and 32 years since the introduction of IBM's first electronic computer

model.3 It is well known that price of mainframe computers per unit of

performance has fallen radically since those early days, by a factor of hundreds
or even thousands, and that a modern personal computer costing a few thousand
dollars has more memory and a faster speed that mainframes costing a million

dollars or more in the 1950s.4 Yet to this day, the Bureau of Labor Statistics
(BLS) in its Producer Price Index (PPI) includes no price index for computers
(either mainframe or personal), despite its inclusion of many hundreds of

1. This was a remark of Norbert Wiener, apparently quoted with approval
by Oskar Morgenstern in his work on the accuracy of economic statistics
(Phister, 1979, p. 4).
2. Forbes, December 22, 1980, P. 24, attributed to Computerworid magazine.

3. The UNIVAC I was the first commercial electronic computer. The first
deliveries to government agencies began in 1951 and the first sale to a
commercial customer took place in 1954. In 1953 IBM offered its first machine,
the IBM 701, and in late 1954 delivered the IBM 650, the first machine to be
produced in quantity. See Sharpe (1969, p. 187). A further description of the
UNIVAC I and the IBM 701 is included in Part II below.

4. The implications of a price decline by a factor of 1,000 is startling to
consider, for this would imply a 1954 price deflator of 100,000 on a base of 1982
100. Fisher, McGowan, and Greenwood (1983, p. 137) give examples of price
declines along several dimensions by a hundred fold or more from the mid 1950s
to late 1970s.

commodity indexes for less important types of mechanical and electrical

machinery. And only in its December, 1985, benchmark revision did the Bureau
of Economic Analysis (BEA) introduce a deflator for the computer component of

producers' durable equipment (PDE) dating back to 1969, after more than two
decades of publishing national income and product accounts (NIPA) based on the

assumption that the prices of electronic computers remained fixed year after
year.5 The NIPA still assume that computer prices remained fixed before 1969.

This paper attempts to construct a single price deflator for electronic
computers for the full period 195 1—84, based on an application of the hedonic

regression technique to four different data sets. Two of these are obtained from
other authors (Chow 1967 and Dulberger 1987), allowing us to duplicate their

results and explore the sensitivity of the implied hedonic price indexes to

changes in specification. The other two data sources (Phister 1979 and
Computerworid magazine) are studied for the first time in this paper.6 Coverage
is limited to mainframe computer processors until 1977, but since 1977

"supermini" computers are included as well. This is the first study of computers
to cover such a long sample period.7 No hedonic regression equations are
developed for personal computers (PCs), but a preliminary matched—model index

5. The BEA's deflation procedures are described by Cartwright (1986) and
are based on hedonic price indexes for computer processors and peripherals
developed in Cole et. al. (1986).
6. The BEA also uses Computerworid data to update its computer price
index for years after 1984.

7. The only other hedonic price index that covers both the 1950s and the
late 1970s is based on a single regression equation containing a single computer
attribute as an explanatory variable. This is the Knight (1983) index, as quoted
by Alexander and Mitchell (1984, Table 9, p. 48). Triplett's (1987) survey paper
summarizes results of other studies over our period but does not present new
research results.

of price changes for PCs for the short 1982-86 interval is provided at the end of
the paper.
Because our four data sets refer to differing time periods, the empirical
section of the paper divides the postwar era into four sub—intervals, and our
"final" hedonic price index uses differing data sources for each of the intervals.
The original Chow data set is preferred for 1954—65, Phister for 1965—72,

Dulberger for 1972—77, and a merged data set that combines the Dulberger and

Computerworid data for 1977_84.8 The end result is an index that exhibits a
1951 index number, on a base 1984

100, of 147,692, implying an annual rate of

change over the 33 years of —19.8 percent.9

The desire for complete time coverage of the postwar period is partly

dictated by a desire for consistency, since this paper is part of a larger research
project that has compiled more than one hundred price indexes covering the
1947—83 period from data sources outside the BEA/BLS reporting system. But the

inclusion of the full period is also important for substantive reasons, since one

objective of this line of research is to understand the relationship (if any)
between the measurement of durable goods prices and the mysterious decline in

productivity growth that began about 1970. If computers have been so

productive, why has the cyclically adjusted rate of productivity growth in the
aggregate U. S. economy slowed in the 1980s to something between zero

(Denison, 1985) and 1.0 percent (Gordon, 1984)? Any contribution of the possible

set.

8. The index is extended back from 1954 to 1951 by using the Phister data

9. Some might prefer to omit the 1951—54 interval, which is based on a
single 1951 observation. The 1954 index number on a 1984 base is 55,370, for an
annual rate of change over 30 years of —19.0 percent. These indexes are
presented in Table 18 below on a base of 1982 100.

Computer Prices, Page 4

mismeasurement of PDE deflators to the productivity slowdown puzzle requires

not just the identification of a price measurement bias, but rather depends on

identifying either a change in the bias and/or a change in the weight attributed
to the product exhibiting the bias. The share of computers in PDE expenditure
was obviously much higher after 1970 than before, but it remains to be seen
whether the net impact of changing weights and the absence of a BEA price
index for computers before 1969 implies a significant change in the extent of
mismeasuremerit of the PDE deflator.

The paper begins with three sections providing background material. Part II
provides a brief overview of the postwar development of the computer industry

and exhibits data on value and numbers of computers sold by major type. Part

III briefly treats the theoretical issues that pertain to the deflation of
expenditures on computers, while Part IV examines aspects of the hedonic

regression methodology that are relevant to this study, including data availability
and definitions, specification, functional forms, structural stability, and make
effects.

Part V provides an introduction to our four data sets and includes tables
that exhibit the mean values of price and quality characteristics over the year8.
Part VI discusses the hedonic regression estimates and the issues involved in
choosing one equation in preference to another. Part VII discusses weighting

issues involved in converting a price index for computers into a deflator for the
"Office, Computing, and Accounting" (OCA) component of PDE. Traditional index

number problems that are of only minor importance in most aspects of deflation
assume major importance in combining computer price indexes into deflators for

aggregates like OCA and PDE. The Paasche index number formula used by the

Computer Prices, Page 5
BEA to compute implicit deflators of PDE and its components convert a —13.1

percent annual rate of change in the BEA electronic computer index between
1969 and 1982 into a mere -3.5 percent annual rate of change in the OCA

deflator over the same period.10 By using weights based on output measured in
constant 1982 dollars, the Paasche weighting method essentially treats the
computer industry as non—existent before 1970, even though the current—dollar

weight for computers in OCA is 41 percent as early as 1963.
The same index number problem also distorts the postwar evolution of the
implicit OCA deflator. For the period 1957-82, the rate of change of the BEA

implicit deflator for OCA is positive and is identical to the rate of change of
non-computer products in OCA; the Paasche implicit deflator methodology causes

BEA's own measured price decline for computers to be totally ignored. For the
period 1957-71, we find the even more startling phenomenon that the deflator
for the computer component of OCA, which declines by 29 percent, and the non—

computer component, which rises by just 8 percent, are aggregated into an
implicit OCA deflator that exhibits an increase of 157 percent! After all the ink
that has been spilled over conceptual debates and hedonic methodology in this
field, it seems highly ironic that issues in index—number weighting procedures are
overwhelmingly the most important source of differences between the BEA

implicit deflator for OCA and the alternative deflator developed in this paper.1'
10. These rates of change are computed from an unpublished BEA
worksheet dated July 30, 1986, which provides the calculation of the total 1969
OCA deflator and of its computer and non—computer components.

11. The statements in this paragraph refer to the BEA's implicit deflator

for OCA, not to the fixed-weight OCA deflator published in NIPA Table 7.13.
However, only the implicit deflator was exhibited or discussed by Cartwright
(1986), and by definition any index-number problem involved in the construction
of the implicit OCA deflator applies by definition to the behavior of real OCA

Computer Prices, Page 6

There are a number of studies that have created price indexes that may be
compared to ours, including Knight (1983), Chow (1967) as extended by Miller
(1980), Archibald and Reece (1979), Cole et. al. (1986), and Dulberger (1987).

Other hedonic regression studies of computer prices have not attempted to

develop price indexes, but rather have been within the industrial organization
literature concerned with whether IBM overprices or underprices its computers
over relatively short time periods (Kelejian—Nicoletti, 1974; Ratchford—Ford, 1976;
Stoneman, 1978; Brock, 1979; Michaels, 1979; Fisher—McGowan—Greenwood, 1983).

Other studies of technological change (Alexander-Mitchell, 1984; Bresnahan, 1985)

and of functional form (Horsley—Swann, 1983) have used the previous hedonic

studies by Chow and/or Knight rather than producing their own. To limit its
scope, this paper provides only a selected comparison of our results with the
previous literature, and for a complete survey defers to Triplett's companion
paper in this volume (1987), which discusses some of the papers listed here and
others as well.
II. THE POSTWAR DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY

This study develops price indexes for computer processors displaying
enormous changes over time; a price index that shrinks from 55,000 to 100 over

a span of 30 years is probably unprecedented in economic history (although
changes in the opposite direction from 100 to 55,000 over shorter periods have

occurred in hyperinflations). A bit of intuition to support these startling
investment. The absence of any influence of the computer on the 1957—82
change in the OCA deflator implies that price changes for computers are ignored
in calculating the change of OCA real investment between 1957 and 1982 (NIPA
Table 5.7).

numbers is provided by a few details on the first electronic computer, the
ENIAC, which was developed during World War II. The ENIAC had a trifling

computational capacity in comparison with today's PCs yet was gigantic in size,

measuring 100 feet long, 10 feet high, and 3 feet wide, and containing about
18,000 vacuum tubes. This machine was programmed by setting thousands of

switches, all of which had to be reset by hand in order to run a different
program. It is reported to have broken down "only" about once per day.12
The first major successor to the ENIAC was the UNIVAC I, originally built

on contract with the U. S. government for use in the 1950 census. All the
UNIVACs built through 1953 were purchased by the government, and an initial
commercial purchase occurred in 1954. Unlike the ENIAC, the UNIVAC operated

with stored programs rather than hand—set switches, and is the first machine in
our hedonic regression sample from the Phister (1979) data source.13 IBM's first
machine was the model 701, initially installed in 1953, and this machine was both
the first machine with a random—access memory (1,024 bits) and the earliest

machine designed to fit into detachable boxes that allowed for multiple assembly—
line manufacture rather than construction on—site in the customer's computer
room. However, the real "model T" of the computer industry was the IBM 650,
first introduced in 1954, of which 1,800 were eventually produced. The IBM 701

appears in the Chow data set used in our hedonic regression equations below
(albeit miscoded with a. 1954 vintage rather than 1953), and the IBM 650 appears

12. This section is based on Cole et. al. (1986), the conference draft of
Dulberger (1987), Einstein—Franklin (1986), and Fisher, McKie, and Mancke (1983).

13. The vintages associated with each observation in the Phister sample
are those listed in the source. Thus the UNIVAC I is attributed to the 1951
vintage, the year that the first unit was delivered to the Cen8us Bureau.

Computer Prices, Page 8

in both the Chow and Phister data sets.
The development of computer technology is often described with a

terminology of technical "generations." Early first—generation machines through

the late

1950s

operated with vacuum tubes, followed by the second—generation

machines based on transitors, starting with the IBM 7000 series introduced in
1959. The first IBM third—generation machines with integrated circuits were the

series 360 models, first installed in 1965. Since the introduction of
semiconductor chips, continuous improvements have been achieved by packaging

increased numbers of circuits closer together, both lowering the marginal cost of
additional memory and reducing instruction execution time. The Dulberger data
sample for the period since 1972 includes a technological class variable for each
mainframe processor (those produced by IBM and three other "plug—compatible"

manufacturers), including two classes of "bipolar" semiconductors and five classes
of field effect transistor (FET) semiconductors, which gradually increased from 1

to 64 kilobits per chip.
The evolution of the computer industry is quantified in Table 1, which
displays domestic purchases (i.e., including imports and excluding exports) for
mainframes, minicomputers, and micros (mainly PCs in the 1980s). Both numbers

of units and the value of shipments are exhibited for each group.'4 Unit values
are not shown to save space but can be calculated. These range for mainframes
from $420,000 in 1955 to $968,000 in 1984; for minis from $110,000 in 1965 to

$58,000 in 1984; and for micros from $15,000 in 1975 to $3,690 in 1984. Prior to

14. The source for Table 1 defines the breakpoint between micros and
minis at $20,000 per units and between minis and mainframes at $250,000.
Nevertheless our Phister data set does not distinguish between minis and
mainframes, including numerous machines with prices below $250,000.

1965 virtually all computers were mainframes, and unit sale8 grew at a 50

percent annual rate while the value of shipments grew at a 44 percent rate
(1955—64). In subsequent decades the annual growth rate of mainframe units
tapered off to 4 percent (1964—74) and 2 percent (1974—84), while the value of

shipments grew at annual rates of 14 and 5 percent in these two decades,

respectively. For these two decades growth rates were much faster for minis (48
and 23 percent for units versus 40 and 22 percent for values for 1965—74 and
1974—84, respectively). The annual growth rate for micro units during 1975—84

was 95 percent and for value was 67 percent.

In assessing the data in Table 1, we stress the importance of the shift from
mainframes to minis and micros; the share of mainframes declined from 97

percent in 1969 to 46 percent in 1984. Since this is the period covered by the
new BEA deflator for computers, which excludes both minis and micros, that

deflator becomes less representative of the total computer industry as the years

go on. It is interesting to note that BEA weighting procedures treat the
mainframe computer industry as essentially non—existent before 1969, yet Table 1

demonstrates that by that year mainframe shipments had reached almost half of
their 1984 value.
In addition to mainframes, this study covers so—called "super—minis", at least

for the period since 1977, and it collects evidence on the rate of price decline

of PCs in the final section. Offsetting this aspect of coverage is the absence of
coverage of peripherals, for which hedonic regression equations are estimated in

Cole et. al. and included in the new BEA deflator. We discuss differences in the

rate of price change for central processors and peripherals in our section on
weighting issues.

Computer Prices, Page 10

How important are computer shipments in the context of the aggregate
economy? Total 1984 shipments of $22.3 billion in Table 1 (which excludes

peripherals) correspond roughly to the preliminary BEA estimate for domestic
computer purchases of $25.7 billion (including peripherals), which has lately been
revised upward to $31.1 billion.'6 Of this, $28.3 billion is PDE, making up 72
percent of the OCA category of PDE ($39.1 billion),'6 and 10 percent of total

PDE. Domestic computer purchases of $31.1 billion amount to just 0.8 percent of

GNP. These figures are important for perspective on the results of this paper;
the radical decline in the implicit deflator for computers and for the OCA
component of PDE has a modest impact on the deflator for total PDE but only a
minor effect on the overall GNP deflator. Even if the pre—1985 computer

deflator had an upward bias of 20 percent per year, this would translate into
only 0.16 percent per year for the GNP deflator. The importance of new
computer price indexes lies not in a revision of indexes of overall inflation, but

rather in such key indicators as the capital/output and investment/output ratio,
as well as indexes of output and productivity in the durable manufacturing sector
of the economy. The scope of this paper extends only to developing a new
deflator for the OCA component of PDE; broader implications for measures of

investment, capital, and output, are discussed in the my forthcoming book that
combines these new computer indexes with indexes for many other products.

from the NIPA May, 1986, tape plus the upward $5.4 billion revision reported in

III. CONCEPTUAL ISSUES IN PRICE MEASUREMENT

"Matched Model" vs. Hedonic Regression Indexes

Several years ago a paper on the development of computer price indexes for
use in the NIPA would have required a substantial conceptual section. This
would have addressed the stated opposition of the BEA to the inclusion in the
NIPA of computer price indexes based on the hedonic regression methodology.

In the last few years, however, the BEA has dropped its previous conceptual
objections to regression—based price indexes. Convergence has occurred to such

an extent that there are no conceptual issues that separate the three papers on
computers in this volume, nor the indexes developed here from those that are
now included in the NIPA for the period since 1969. Any differences involve
choices made in empirical implementation, and the critical issues of weighting

involved in in aggregating a hedonic index for computer processors into a

deflator for broader categories of investment and output. This section provides
a summary of the distinction between "matched model" and hedonic price indexes

and, for historical purposes provides a brief interpretation of the BEA's pre—1984

objections to the inclusion of hedonic price indexes for computers in the
national accounts.

Triplett (1986) has provided an admirably concise introduction to the

interpretation of hedonic price indexes. These indexes can be distinguished from
the "conventional method" used by the BLS to construct the Consumer Price

Index (CPI) and the Producers Price Index (PPI). In the recent literature on
computer price indexes, the conventional method has been called the "matched
model" method, since it involves comparing prices only for models that are

identical in quality from one year to the next.

The most important potential defect in a matched model index is the

omission of price changes implicit in the introduction of new or 'unmatched"
models. A matched model index assumes that the price change implicit in the
introduction of new models is identical to the price change of the matched

models over the same time interval. While this might be a valid assumption for

some products, it is clearly invalid for electronic computers, as has been
demonstrated recently by Cole et. al. (1986) in their comparison of matched—

model and hedonic price indexes for the same sample of computers. The effect

of the introduction of new technology that reduces the price of quality
characteristics (e.g., computer speed and memory) is to cause the price of old
models to be bid down. The prices of old models included in the matched model
price indexes may fail to duplicate the price reductions on new models either
because (a) firms may sell old models at a discounted price but report list prices
to the compiler of the price index or (b) firms may fail to reduce the

transaction price of old models, thus causing their sales to disappear at a speed
that depends on lags in information, lags in consumer reaction (due perhaps to
employee training costs for switching to new models), and supply bottlenecks or
backlogs on new models.
The "Resource Cost" Criterion

Until as recently as 1983 (as expressed in Jaszi, 1971, and Department of
Commerce, 1983), it was the position of the BEA that the declining prices of

new computer models should not be taken into account in the NIPA.'7 For

17. To help date the change in position at the BEA, the 1983 draft of the
U. S. Department of Commerce paper was not published the form cited here and
is superseded by the work of Cole et. al. (1986) and Cartwright (1986).

Computer Prices, Page 13

Jaszi, the absence of a computer price deflator was not just an unfortunate
omission necessitated by the failure of the BLS to produce a suitable commodity

price index. Instead, Jaszi defended his agency's practice of setting the price
deflator for computers equal to 1.00 by arguing that quality adjustments should
not be made when an increase in computer performance relative to price was
made possible by a technological innovation.

Recognition that we try to implement [the principle that quality

changes must be reflected in real cost increases] is relevant in
connection with R. J. Gordon's criticism of our assumptions about the

prices of electronic computers. He does not document his statement,

but he may be referring to an article by G. C. Chow [1967]. The

measurements presented in that article do not seem to be based on the
principle to which OBE and most experts subscribe, viz, that quality

improvements can be quantified only to the extent that they are
accompanied by real cost increses. After extensive consultations with
representatives of the computer industry, OBE came to the conclusion

that the convention it adopted was a closer approximation of the
underlying concept it sought to implement" (1971, p. 203).18

At the time he was writing, Jaszi was correct that the price of a given
computer model tended to remain the same throughout its lifetime.19 However,

18. This paragraph was a response to my criticism of the BEA (then the
Office of Business Economics, or OBE) for the absence of a computer deflator.
See Gordon (1971a).

19. Sharpe (pp. 262—3) notes that while "the rental charged for older
equipment should decrease over time in order to keep such equipment competitive
• the facts are greatly at odds with this simple view. By and large the
monthly rental charged for a given piece of equipment remains the same
throughout the period over which it is offered for lease." Supporting this view
•

Computer Prices, Page 14

the basic issue is whether the NIPA deflator should take account of the sharp
decline in price per unit of characteristics when a new model is introduced and

the old model is no longer in production. A resolution of this issue revolves
around the definition of the appropriate unit of measurement, and the crucial
distinction between movements along cost functions and shifts in those
functions.

Such cost functions are displayed in Figure 1, where the horizontal axis

takes the appropriate unit of measurement of output to be the quality
characteristic (e.g., memory and MIPS), not the computer "box", and the quantity
of characteristics is designated . The vertical axis represents the cost of

production (V), and the two upward sloping schedules represent two alternative
technologies for producing computer characteristics, with the schedule running

through point A having the higher cost per unit of characteristics. For a given
quantity of characteristics at any given level of technology, say )o in Figure 1,
an increase in the quantity of characteristics is "accompanied by real cost

increases," as the Jaszi criterion requires. Thus there is no controversy about
the desirability of making quality adjustments in price indexes when larger, more
expensive computers replace smaller, less expensive computers at a given level of
technology. But such cases are seldom observed, since more powerful computers

are typically introduced without a price increase to signal the need for a
traditional "resource—cost" adjustment. Instead, a computer manufaturer typically
is the Chow data set summarized in Table 3 below, which shows absolutely no
year—to—year change in rentals for identical machines which appear in his sample
for more than one year. However, Cole et. al. (1986) display a matched—model
index that exhibits a decline for most of the 1972-84 period. One reconciliation
of this conflicting evidence is simply that rentals on old models remained fixed
before 1970, but that the shift from leasing to direct sale allowed greater price
flexibility on old models to occur in the 1970s and 1980s.

introduces a new model containing, say, twice as much memory or speed with

little or no increase in the computer's price. The opposition to quality
adjustments to price indexes for computers by Jaszi and other adherents of the
"resource cost" criterion of quality change stemmed from a failure to recognize

that the price per characteristic declines whenever there is a downward shift in

the cost function, i.e., a shift from )o to )u in Figure 1.
A search of the literature reveals no convincing argument that a quality
adjustment should not be made in the case of a declining price per character—
istic, as in Figure 1.20 Most adherents of the resource—cost approach refer back
to Denison's famous (1957) article, but upon closer inspection Denison's basic

argument against the characteristics approach is not based on logical principle.
Indeed, he calls an approach which equates units of capital having the same

number of characteristics "coherent and of extreme interest.' Instead, he
objects on grounds of infeasibility, that the characteristics approach "simply
cannot be measured," but this pessimistic assessment was written before
Griliches' (1961) paper that demonstrated the feasibility of the hedonic regression

technique. In those cases where objective evidence is available on the
appropriate unit of measurement to define the characteristic, there seems to be

no case in the literature for ignoring downward shifts in the cost function
generated by reductions in the cost of producing quality characteristics.

In Jaszi's defense, many participants in this debate believed that the
hedonic regression technique represented a "user—value" criterion of quality
change that was incompatible with the preferred "resource—cost" criterion, until

20. The details are given in Chaper 2 of The Measurement of Durable

Goods Prices, pp. 2—21 through 2—32.

Computer Prices, Page 16

Rosen's important (1974) article showed that in principle the hedonic technique

traced out a price—quality locus that represented a series of successive tangency
points of indifference (user—value) and production possibility (resource—cost)

curves. A full reconciliation of the user—value and resource—cost criteria,

restated in terms of "characteristics space", was achieved by Triplett (1983),
whose work formed the basis for my own alternative exposition in Gordon
(1983).21

The preceding section attempts to clarify the context of the pre—1984

debate regarding the advisability of including hedonic price indexes for computers
in the NIPA. Most observers, both outside and inside BEA, now believe that
agency waited too long to introduce computer prices into the national accounts.

However, the position taken by the BEA on the correct quality criterion had no
influence on advance planning for the PPI and cannot explain the lack of
development of a computer price index in the BLS price index program. Over

the postwar period the BEA has acted as a user of price indexes developed by
the BLS (both CPI and PPI components), but BEA attitudes about the issues
discussed above have not fed backwards to determine how the BLS measured

prices or what prices were measured.

21. As a historical footnote, the first draft of the theoretical chapter in

my durable goods monograph, written in 1972, provided a graphical analysis like
that of Figure 1, illustrating the downward shift in the cost function for
computers, represented on a diagram plotting price per computer characteristic
("computation") against the quantity of characteristics. However, each of these
cost functions was horizontal. Triplett's (1983) insight was to recognize that
along any given production function, an increase in the quantity of computer
characteristics was "resource—using", i.e., required an increase in cost, as along
either "V't function in Figure 1. This showed that a given product could
simultaneously exhibit "resource—using" quality change when moving along a
single "V't function, but also a reduction in price per unit of quality when the
"V" function shifted downwards.

Computer Prices, Page 17

It should also be emphasized, as at the beginning of Part III, that
differences between the BEA and others on the desirability of including price
indexes for computers in the NIPA are no longer relevant to the discussion of
alternative price indexes for computers, or broader categories like OCA or PDE,

since both the BEA and outside investigations (like this study) use hedonic

regression equations to create price indexes for computers in roughly the same
way. The major differences between the BEA price indexes for broader
categories, like OCA and PDE, and our alternatives, involves the choice among

traditional index number formulae rather than the theory of the price indexes
themselves.22
III. THE HEDONIC REGRESSION MODEL

Basic Features

The hedonic regression approach can be viewed as one of several methods

to estimate the slope of the function relating the cost of a product to its

quantity of characteristics. It assumes that the price of a product observed at a
given time is a function of its quality characteristics, and it estimates the
imputed prices of such characteristics by regressing the prices of different
models of the product on their differing embodied quantities of characteristics.
Thus the hedonic price approach does not represent a new concept in the
measurement of quality change, but is an alternative to the manufacturers' cost
22. A discussion of the important distinctions between input and output
indexes, and between the quality—adjustment criterion and the estimator
actually used to adjust price indexes, appears in Triplett (1983) and Gordon's
alternative exposition (1983) of Triplett's model. The first distinction is
also treated in Triplett (1986).

Computer Price8, Page [8

estimates used for quality adjustment in most of the "matched—model" commodity
price indexes compiled by the BLS for the PPI and CPI, to be used when
practical factors make it more suitable.

A common approach to the estimation of quality—adjusted price change is
to include time dummy variables (Dt) in cross—section regressions explaining
price (pit) for two or more years:

=

l

log

+ E

t=l

(i

...,

n; t = 0,

..

+

., N)

Here again y is the quality characteristic, as in Figure 1. In equation (1)
we choose a log—linear (or "double log", referring to the presence of logs on
both sides of the equation) specification, following the majority of hedonic

regression studies of computers. An alternative would be a semi—log specification, with the log of price of the left and the unlogged values of the y

variables on the right. Other alternatives to (1) would be, first, to develop
separate price indexes for the prices of the characteristics (j) or, second,
to estimate the price of characteristics in a base year and then to use these
estimated prices to compute the real quantity of characteristics in other
years at base—year prices.23

Leaving aside these alternative methods, which are not used in this
paper, and returning to equation (1), we can obtain an aggregate index of

price change either from the series of A coefficients obtained in a single
regression for a number of years, or from a string of A coefficients obtained

23. The first alternative method is carried out for computers in Cole
et. al. (1986). The second alternative method is used by Chow (1967) for
computers and by Triplett—McDonald (1977) for refrigerators.

Computer Prices, Page 19

from a series of "adjacent year" regressions on data for successive pairs of

years. To the extent that the prices of quality characteristics are changing
through time, the latter adjacent—year technique allows the regression

coefficients on the Ylit to change frequently and is preferable. The
disadvantage of the adjacent—year technique is that sample sizes are sometimes
too small to make it feasible, and estimated coefficients on the quality
characteristics jump erratically from year to year and may even change

sign.24 To the extent that the estimated implicit prices of characteristics

() shift

from year to year, the results of the adjacent—year regressions

will differ from a pooled regression like (1) fit to the same time interval.
In the implementation of the hedonic technique in this paper, our results are
based on regression equations pooled over short sample periods determined by
the availability of various data sets (1954—65, 1965—72, 1972—77, and 1977—

84). However, we also experiment with estimates of both pooled and adjacent—
year equations for our Phister data set over the period 1951—72.

Interpreting Residuals in Hedonic Regression Equations

No hedonic regression equation will fit the data perfectly. The
estimated residuals (Ult) represent the effects of excluded attributes,
incorrect specification of functional form, marketing practices unrelated to
production costs, demand discontinuities, and time lags due to the fact that a
new model may have a lower price than an older model containing the same

24. Chow's (1967) study displays erratically shifting coefficients in
the adjacent-year regressions, indicating that his sample size was too small
to make the adjacent—year technique feasible. The final Chow hedonic price
index exhibited in that study and picked up by the subsequent literature is
based on a pooled regression. Horsley and Swann (1983) also criticize Chow
for erratic shifts in coefficients.

Computer Prices, Page 20

quantity of characteristics. Some variables are omitted because they are
highly correlated with other variables that are included. The coefficients on
an included variable thus represents not just its own effect on price, but
coefficients

also that of the omitted variable(s). Thus the estimated

cannot necessarily be interpreted as representing the value that users place
on a particular attribute.

Omitted attributes afflict all hedonic regression studies but may be
particularly important in research on computer prices, since no study, including
this one, has been able to quantify software maintenance, engineering support, or

manufacturer's reputation. If these omitted variables differ systematically across
manufacturers, then their effect on prices can be captured by manufacturer dummy

variables (Mk) or "make effects." Make effects have been studied not just for
computers but also for other products, including automobiles. In an adjacent—year
regression, with a single time dummy (Di) for the second year, make effects would
enter as follows:

(2)

a0 + 51D1 +

log itk

(i

k=lk

Many hedonic studies of electronic computers have been concerned not so much

with the

or 6 coefficients, but with the ,u make effect coefficients, particularly

in connection with the possibility that purchasers were willing to pay more for IBM
machines as a result of better software, reputation, or other attributes not
included in the

vector. We note that the specification (2) allows a make effect

only to shift the constant term rather than to shift both the constant and the

implicit prices ()

of

the characteristics. An alternative to (2) would be to

Computer Prices, Page 21

estimate separate regressions in format (1) for each separate make. Since our major
emphasis is on changes in computer price indexes over time, our investigation of make
effects is limited to the inclusion of IBM make—effect dummy variables for some of

our regression equations.
Related to make effects is the question of commodity boundaries. In a sense our
study does not extend back far enough in time, since the first
electronic computer may have represented a decline in the price—performance ratio of

the previous "computer," some mixture of a punched card sorting machine and a clerk
with a calculator.25 The same issue arises in a cross—section, since one can ask
whether mainframe, mini, and micro computers are all the same product. Below we
include "superminis" in our post—1977 sample and ask whether they lie along the same

hedonic function as mainframes; in principle it should be possible to treat personal
computers in the same way if suitable data were available.
Numerous pitfalls in applying the hedonic regression technique have surfaced in
the literature, but one seems to apply with particular force in the computer industry.
The Rosen (1974) equilibrium interpretation of a hedonic surface may not apply in the

computer case, because the computer market has "never been close to long—run

equilibrium in its entire existence."26 Old inferior models do not just disappear when

a new superior model is introduced, nor are they repriced at a lower price—perfor-

mance ratio equal to that of the new model. This suggests that new and old models
may lie on different hedonic surfaces.
25. Fisher, McKie, and Mancke (1983, p. 3) report that the first electronic
computer, the ENIAC, carried out calculations between 100 and 500 faster than
punched card machines with electro—magnetic relays.
26. Fisher, McGowan, Greenwood (1983, p. 149).

Computer Prices, Page 22
Functional Form

In the 1940s, Herbert R. Grosch asserted that for computer equipment average

co8t decreases substantially as size increases.27 If we write the relationship between

the price of a computer system (p) and its "effectiveness" (y = total characteristics
embodied in the system), as follows,
(3)

p

Ky1,or

logp

logK+blogy,

where K is a constant, then "Grosch's Law" asserts that b

1/2. A number of early
studies of the cost—effectiveness relationship found that the validity of the Grosch
"square—root" law depended on the measure of effectiveness. For instance, in one
study the b coefficient was 0.26 for matrix inversion, 0.47 for statistical computations,

and 0.70 for sorting. Greater economies of scale seemed to be available for scientific
than for commercial computing.28

Perhaps because of the influence of the early literature on Grosch's Law, most
of the hedonic studies of electronic computers have adopted the log-linear functional

form. Knight added a term in the square of the log, but it added little explanatory
power.29 Others have chosen the semi—log form, including Archibald-Reece (1979) and

Michaels (1979). The first draft of this paper provided estimates of both the log—
linear and semi—log specifications and found that the former fits much better in both
the Phister and Computerworid data sets. This finding confirms Dulberger's (1987)

similar finding on her own data set. However, Dulberger has found that the sum of

the coefficients on memory and speed (MIPS) in her data set sum to unity in the loglinear specification of (3), thus contradicting Grosch's Law predicting that b = 0.5.
V. THE DATA

The Four Data Sources

The results in this study are based on four overlapping data sources. For the
years 1954-79 we have the compilation by Phister (1979), which provides for roughly
100 mainframe models a long list of quality characteristics, as well as a variety of

sales prices and rental rates. For many but not all of the models, the Phister tables
list 95 separate quality characteristics, including a wide variety of different
performance measures (e.g., included memory, several dimensions of speed, and the
Knight commercial and scientific indexes) as well as a number of attributes of more

dubious importance (e.g., floor space, weight, and price per pound of both central
processor and memory), and 20 lines of information on prices and rental rates.
For the period 1977-84 our data source is Computerworid magazine, published by
the International Data Corporation (IDC), which also publishes the bimonthly EDP

Industry Report, the source of data in several earlier studies, including
U. S. Department of Commerce (1983). We were attracted to Computerworld because
of its annual hardware issue, which makes available all the required information in a
single place for each year of the sample period. Later we discovered that the annua1
hardware issue began only in 1981, making an issue—by—issue search necessary for

earlier years. It was possible to search only back to 1977 by the time the deadline
for this paper approached.
As for the other two data sources, Gregory Chow provided the data used in his
original 1967 article, and the BEA provided the data used by Ellen Dulberger (1987)

Computer Prices, Page 24

and Cole et. al. for computer processors. In the following sections we describe the

Phister and Computerworid data in some detail, since these are used here for the first
time, and devote less attention to the Chow and Dulberger data, since these are
described by those authors.
The Phister Data
Phister's data on speed and memory mainly come from Auerbach Computer

Technology Reports a comprehensive guide published since the early 1960s by
Auerbach Information, Inc. His sources for system prices include General Service
Administration catalogues, price lists published by various manufacturers, and

Auerbach. Phister dates his prices as pertaining to "roughly two years after a model
was introduced," where the introduction dates come from IDC.

The Phister data includes, for most computer models, two types of prices. First,
there is a system price accompanied by information on the amount of memory included

in that price. Second, there is information on the price of incremental memory.
Since we did not know the typical memory configuration of each model, we took the

apparently straightforward approach of transcribing just the system price. Later we
discovered that several machines were priced at a zero level of memory, i.e., just
including the processing unit. Fortunately information was given on the incremental
price of memory, and so for each such machine we created three observations,
corresponding to the price and characteristics of models configured with minimum,
maximum, and mean memory sizes (each of the three would have an identical

operating speed). This procedure is identical to that carried out by Dulberger in
creating her sample, except that she creates two observations corresponding to
minimum and maximum memory.

Seven indexes of speed are provided by Phister, including memory cycle time and

Computer Prices, Page 25

several different measures of addition and multiplication speed. Initially we included
memory cycle time and multiplication speed, as did Chow (1967), but soon found that

they are highly collinear in the Phister sample. Because the only overlapping speed
variable available in the Computerworid data is memory cycle time, we omitted

multiplication speed from the results presented in part VI of this paper, which include
only memory and memory cycle time for the regressions estimated for the Phister
data.
Also available from Phister are the Knight commercial and scientific performance
indexes, which use a formula to weight together memory, processor time, and input—

output time factors, and these are calculated from more basic specifications of each
computer. Because the Knight indexes are composite blends of memory and speed
based on ttthe opinions of 43 senior computer engineers and programmers"30 in the

early 1960s, the weighting factors may be obsolete, and so we prefer to let the
weights on memory and speed be freely estimated and do not include the Knight

indexes as explanatory variables. However it is interesting that, as an example of the
extent of reduction in the price—performance ratio in the industry, the Knight
commercial index increases from 119 for the 1954 IBM model 650 to 564,000 for the

1979 IBM model 4331, yet the nominal price of the 4331 was less than half that of
the 650.31

The Computerworld Data

The Computerworid data set for 1977-84 includes several quality attributes not
available from Phister, including minimum and maximum memory size, minimum and

30. Phister (1979), p. 358.
31. Phister (1979), pp. 339, 359, and 631.

Computer Prices, Page 26
maximum number of input—output channels, and cache buffer size. Additional input—

output channels allow a computer to use its central processor and memory more effi—

ciently by loading instructions and data from several devices at the same time, and a
cache buffer memory allows a powerful processor to use a low—cost, relatively slow

integrated circuit memory.32 Because these additional variables are available in the
Computerworid sample but not in the Phister sample, we estimated separate equations
for each sample and did not pool them.33
Other Data Sources

In addition to our new data from Phister and Computerworid, we have also
obtained two other data sets, the original Chow data covering 1954—65 used in his
article (1967), and the Dulberger (1987) data set covering IBM and compatible

machines for 1972-84 (provided on a PC diskette by the BEA). The Chow data set is

considerably larger than the Phister sample for the years of overlap, and we shall

find that it gives more satisfactory results. We use the Dulberger data set as our
primary source for 1972—77. After 1976 we have both the Dulberger and
Computerworid samples, and we merge these to maximize sample size and coverage.

In the merged sample the Dulberger source is used for all IBM machines, and

Computerworid is used for all other machines. A defect of the merged sample is that
we do not have Dulberger's technological class variables for computers other than IBM
and plug—compatibles, and we do not have some of the special Computerworid variables

(input—output channels, cache buffer size) for the IBM models. Thus our results for

32. Phister (1979), p. 524.
33. Also available from Computerworid starting in 1980 is a dummy

variable for the presence of "bus architecture." This was not included in our

regressions due to its omission from the 1977—79 portion of the Computerworid data.

Computer Prices, Page 27

the merged sample do not use all of the available information in the separate samples.
There are several differences among these data sets that we need to keep in
mind. Chow (with a few exceptions) and Phister include only computers in their first
year of production (new models), while Dulberger and Computerworld cover all models

in production. Dulberger's data cover a narrower range of manufacturers but is the
most carefully developed for the consistency of price and quality characteristics. The
Phister data set is relatively small and leads to hedonic price indexes that. display
implausible year—to-year jumps. We use the Phister data mainly for the 1965-72
period, when we have no overlap from other data sets, and as a check on the secular
rate of price decline for other periods.
Data Issues
New Models vs. All Models. The Phister source has the great advantage that

everything is in one place. The disadvantage is the limitation of the data to new
models rather than all models sold in a given year, although our previous discussion
pointed out that the computer market is characterized by perpetual disequilibrium,
with manufacturers maintaining intact the original prices of equipment which has been
made obsolescent by newer machines. For this reason, Fisher, McGowan, and
Greenwood (1983) argue forcefully that a hedonic regression study should include only

new models, a requirement satisfied by the Phister data at the cost of a relatively
small sample size.

Because the Dulberger and Co

rworll data include models introduced both in

the current year and in previous years, it is possible to address the issue of the
pricing behavior by manufacturers of older models. We have estimated regressions
covering only models in their year of introduction, and in addition we have construct
a BLS—type specification index of matched models, i.e., of price changes on models in

Computer Prices, Page 28

each year of their production starting in the year after their introduction. We find,
not surprisingly, that the price index for new models declines much faster than the
index for matched models. As found by Cole et. aL, the matched model index does

not remain stationary but rather declines over time, at a rate slower than the price
index for new models. Since our matched model index for the post—1972 period

duplicates that of Cole et. al., we do not report it in this paper to save space.
However, we do explore the implications of the inconsistency created by the

inclusion of both old and new models in the Dulberger and Computerworid data sets

for the period since 1972, as contrasted to the inclusion of only new models in the

Chow and Phister data sets that cover the earlier period (a few old models are
included by Chow during 1954-59). Based on the evidence that before 1970 the rental
rates of computers remained constant over their lifetime (see footnote 19 above), we

construct an "augmented sample" for the Phister data which includes each model for
four successive years at a constant price, in contrast to the "new—only" Phister sample

that includes each model for just the year of introduction. The hedonic price indexes
developed from the augmented Phister sample display rates of price change that are
slower and smoother than those developed from the new—only Phister sample.
•Weighting

market shares. Ideally it would be desirable to run adjacent-year

regressions for each pair of the 31 years in the full 1954-84 period and to weight
each observation by market share in each year. However, the requisite market share

data are not available from our data sources. Phister presents an inventory of the
installed number of computers for some but not all models, and Computerworid does

not provide numbers produced or installed. Our regression equations weight each
observation equally, which results in an underweighting of IBM machines, which had a

share ranging from 60 to 75 percent in the total revenue of the data processing

-

Computer

Prices, Page 29

industry, but represents only about half of the observations in the Phister sample and
only about 18 percent of the observations in the Computerworid sample. It is

doubtful that this is a serious limitation, however, since the rate of price decline for
1977—84 is roughly the same for IBM products as for the full sample.

Rental Rates vs. Purchase Prices. The dependent variable in all our regressions

is the log of purchase price. How different would be the results if the log of the
rental rate were instead taken as the dependent variable? Phister provides data for
all models on the rental rate, purchase price, and price—rental ratios. A scan of this
ratio of purchase price to monthly rental indicates that is falls within the range of 40
to 60 for almost all models in the Phister sample, with no evident time trend. The
variance of this ratio over time is trivial compared to the variance of the price—

performance ratio over time, suggesting that alternative regressions using the rental
rate would yield almost exactly the same results as those exhibited in Part V.
•Peripherals. While price—performance ratios for peripheral equipment (tape and

disc drives, printers, etc.) fell over time by substantial amounts, the available
evidence, especially that presented by Cole et. al. (1986), suggests that the rate of
price decline was less than that for mainframe processing systems. Sufficient data
exist in Phister's book to provide a price index for each major type of peripheral
going back well before the 1972 starting date of Cole et. al., but this exercise is
beyond the feasible research scope of the present paper.34

•Software. Our regressions cover only hardware prices, not the full operating

cost of performing "computations," which would also include costs of software,

maintenance, electricity, and rent on floorspace. However, our hardware prices

34. The study by Archibald-Reece (1979) is one of the few that includes
prices and attributes of peripherals in a hedonic regression equation for
mainframe computer systems.

Computer Prices, Page 30

include the basic system software that a manufacturer supplies with each machine.

This has increased manyfold in quality and quantity, along with the increase in system
performance. For instance, in 1954 IBM supplied only about 6,000 lines of code as
programming support for the model 650 computer. The company provided an assembler

and a few basic utility routines, but that was all. But as new models were
introduced, the software provided grew exponentially. By the late 1960s the operating
system for the IBM 360 series, designed to improve system performance and to provide

a wide variety of useful operating features, included over 5 million lines of code.
From 1965 to 1975, software was a constant share (roughly 35 percent) of the total
developmental cost of computer manufacturers.35

Then in 1969 IBM announced its "unbundling" decision, that separate charges

would be made for systems engineering services and education and for new program

products, "as distinct from system control programming." IBM also reduced its prices

by 3 percent, an amount which represented its estimate of the value of the excluded

services. No adjustment is made in this study for unbundling, partly on the ground
that 3 percent is a small number, and partly because software developments had led to
increasingly sophisticated operating systems that have relieved customer programmers
of various complex tasks and made them more self—sufficient of the manufacturers'
systems engineering personnel.36

are non—IBM. Included are all of the general purpose systems and many of the

"minis" which were important in the sense that their number in use, value in use, or
total operations per second ranked them first or second in any given generation of
computers. Also included are some IBM computers and all non—IBM computers whose

number or value exceeded one percent of total worldwide computer installations in

some year. The table displays yearly means for system price, memory included in that
price, and machine cycle time. Average system price in 1979 is almost the same as in
1954, but memory included is 85 times higher, while speed is 6800 times faster.

The Chow data are summarized in Table 3. Here we note the larger sample than
Phister for the 1954—65 period, and generally much smoother year-to—year changes.

The exception is a sharp decline in access time between 1962 and 1963, and a smaller

but still sharp decline in multiplication time in the same year. The price jumps in
1954—55 and 1956—57 seem closely related to movements in the same direction of

memäry. A comparison of the two tables suggests that the Chow data will yield a

computer price index with a smoother rate of price decline, and indeed this proves to
be the case.
The Dulberger data are summarized in Table 4. The sample is comparable

in size to that of Chow in the 1970s and considerably larger in the 1980s, but the
number of observations includes not just new machines (of which the Chow sample is
primarily comprised) but also machines in their second, third, and sometimes fourth

year of production. This repeated appearance by the same machine over several years
helps to account for the smoothness of the changes in price and quality averages from

one year to the next, particularly in comparison with the Phister data in Table 2. A
particular advantage of the Dulberger—BEA data set is the inclusion of variables

indicating the technology class of a processor; these variables are highly significant in

the regression equations shown in Tables 12 and 15, but unfortunately they are not
available for our other three data sets.
The Computerworid data are summarized in Table 5. There are two

classifications, the IBM models that we take over from the Dulberger data set, and
the Computerworld data for the non-IBM models. The IBM sample contains larger
machines than the non—IBM sample, reflecting the inclusion of "super—mini" computers

in the latter. There is a continued downward trend in price per unit of included
memory in the non—IBM sample, but much less of an improvement in the average

values of the quantity characteristics than in the IBM portion of the sample.
VI. REGRESSION RESULTS

The regression results are presented beginning in Table 6 for the 1951—65 period,

where we compare results using the Chow and Phister data sets. The specification is
log—linear, with t ratios shown in parenthesis next to the coefficients on the quality

attributes, and with asterisks used to designate the significance levels of the time
dummies, so as to avoid an excessive clutter of numbers in the tables. The time
dummy coefficients are defined on a base of 1954

0. For the Chow data, "new"

means the subset of observations for the first year when they appear, and "all" means

all observations in the data set without editing. For the Phister data, we determined
from his book that the typical model was in production for four years, and the
Phister "augmented" sample consists of each observation repeated four times. This
assumption that the price of old models remains constant over their lifetime (at least
before 1970) seems consistent with the evidence in the Chow data set that each model

included in the sample for more than one year maintains a fixed rental rate.
Table 6 includes several explanatory variables. Memory is common to both the

Chow and Phister data sets, but the measures of speed differ and are listed
separately. Also included are "model dummies't (e.g., "IBM 7094") for one or more

specific models in a particular year. These are entered only for particular variants of
the Phister results for new—only models in an attempt to smooth out erratic jumps in

the hedonic price index implied by the new-only Phister sample. The results begin
in column (1) of Table 6 with the full Chow sample and Chow's three original quality
characteristics, memory, access time, and multiplication time. Column (2) adds a make
dummy for IBM models, which is highly significant in the Chow sample but makes

little difference to the rate of price decline. Also, the rate of price decline and the
coefficients are the same in the new—only Chow subsample, which is not surprising

since the number of observations drops only from 137 to 119 as a result of editing
the sample to include only new models.

The results for the Phister data source during the 1951-65 interval are displayed
in the three right—hand columns of Table 6. The augmented sample, displayed in

column (4), includes each model for the year of its introduction and for the following

three years. While the coefficients on memory and speed are very close to those for
the Chow sample in the first three columns, the 1954—65 price decline is substantially

slower. This is to be expected, since the presence of old models in the sample damps
the rate of price decline. For the "unaugmented" or new—only Phister sample in
column (5), the 1954—65 rate of price decline is almost identical to the basic Chow
result in column (1), with 1965 time dummy coefficients of —2.34 and —2.30,

respectively. The decline from 1954 to 1960 is also very similar (—1.07 and —1.13,

respectively). The Phister estimates, however, exhibit two sharp jumps that are not
present in the Chow estimates. The first occurs in 1957, with a time dummy
coefficient of +0.55, preceded and followed by coefficients of —0.60 in 1955 and 1958.

Computer Prices, Page 34

The second occurs in 1962, when the time dummy drops from -1.09 to -1.78, and then
climbs back to -1.23.
One modification was made to the specification in column (5) to identify the

source of the jumps in the Phister sample of new models. Four models were
identified that seemed to have a price—performance ratio very different from other
models in 1957, 1958, and 1962. These are the IBM 305 (1957), UNIVAC 2 (1957),

Burroughs 220 (1958), and IBM 7094 (1962). Column (6) exhibits the modified pooled

regression for the new Phister sample. Because both 1957 models in the same are
dunimied out, there is no time dummy coefficient shown for 1957. The jump from
1962 to 1963 is reduced substantially, from 0.55 to 0.20. While only one of the model

dummy coefficients is significant in Table 6, all are included here to be consistent
with the adjacent—year regressions for the same sample in Table 7, where all the four
model dummy variables are significant. Unlike the pooled equations, which restrict
the coefficients on memory and speed to be the same for the entire 1951—65 period,

the adjacent-year equations in Table 7 allow these coefficients to shift. The
coefficient on memory is quite stable at about 0.4 until 1961-62, when it rises to an

average of 0.66 for the last four equations in the table. The coefficient on speed is
quite unstable, with much higher values between 1959 and 1963 than either before or

after. In the adjacent—year equations there is no time dummy for 1957, since both
1957 models are duinmied out, while the 1962—63 jump is almost completely eliminated.

Table 8 displays the price indexes implied by the time dummy coefficients in
Tables 6 and 7. The left—hand column presents Chow's (1967) basic index as

published, calculated as the ratio of nominal rentals to a hypothetical real rental in
1960 prices, based on estimates of coefficients on characteristics from a pooled
regression for 1960—65. Then columns (1) through (6) present price indexes calculated

from the time dummy coefficients in the corresponding columns of Table 6, while

column (7) displays the price index implied by the time coefficients from the

adjacent—year regressions of Table 7. Taking only the years 1954 and 1965, the rate

of price decline of the published Chow Index is quite close to that computed from the
time dummies of the various hedonic regressions performed on the Chow sample from

columns (1)—(3). For our "final" price index for computers used in calculations at the
end of the paper, we must choose one of these indexes. To maintain comparability
with the years after 1965 we prefer an index based on time dummies, as in columns

(1) through (3) rather than the index Chow computed in the left-hand column. Of the
three sets of time dulnmie8, we prefer column (2), since this version includes a dummy

for IBM models that is of a plausible magnitude and is highly significant.
The price index for the augmented Phister sample displays a much slower decline
in price at an average rate of —13.1 percent per annum, as constrasted with —18.4

percent for the index based on Chow data in column (2). This is not unexpected,
since each model appears in the augmented Phister sample 4.0 times but in the Chow

sample only 1.15 times. Thus the augmented Phister sample damps the rate of price
decline, since it includes more old models than the Chow sample. While one might

argue that the augmented Phister sample is more comparable to the Dulberger and
Computerworid samples used for the post—1972 period, since these include old models,

the augmented Phister sample may overly damp the rate of price decline of computers

for two reasons. First, by assuming that there are no price changes on old models,
the augmented Phister sample may ignore price reductions that occur in the latter

years of production of old models. Second, at the end of the period in 1965 the
augmented Phister sample contains roughly three—quarters old models, whereas in 1954

it contains only a single 1951 model. Thus the importance of old models is greater at

Computer Prices, Page 36

the end than the beginning, helping to damp the rate of price decline registered in
column (4) of Table 8.

The remaining columns show the behavior of price indexes developed from the
Phister sample of new models. The price decline exhibited for 1954—65 in column (5)

is similar to that for the Chow sample, but there are large and implausible jumps in
1957 and 1963. The two right hand columns -—

for the pooled regression and (7)
for adjacent years —— are based on equations containing four model dummies. Here
(6)

the jumps evident in column (5) are eliminated, and the rate of price decline increases.
substantially. This occurs because the process of dummying out the "problem models"

tends to increase the absolute value of the coefficient on speed, which in turn
increases the extent of the price decline that is estimated to occur when new, faster
models are introduced.

Table 9 shows the regression results for 1965—72 for both the augmented and

new—only versions of the Phister sample (recall that we have no other data source
covering this period). The augmented and new—only results are similar, except that

the rate of price decline is much smoother in the augmented sample. The coefficient
on machine cycle time is insignificant throughout, as are the IBM and size dummies,
except for the dummy for small memory size in the augmented sample (column 3).

The results in columns (4) and (5) for the Phister sample of new models display
upward jumps in time dummy coefficients in 1968 and 1971, while in the augmented

sample these years exhibit not an upward jump but a relatively slow rate of price
decline.

As in the previous 195 1—65 sample period, further tests of the Phister new—

model sample were carried out for the 1965—72 period in an attempt to create

smoother time dummy coefficients. First, in column (6) of Table 9 a pooled regression

is estimated in which a dummy variable is included for several 1970 models that seem
to be underpriced. This make dummy for 1970 ("MD 1970") is almost significant in

the pooled regression and eliminates most but not all of the implausible drop and
rebound of the time dummy coefficients for 1970 and 1971 evident in both columns (4)

and (5) of Table 9. Then in Table 10 adjacent—year regressions are estimated that are
identical in specification to Table 9, column (6). The MD 1970 variable is included

and the machine cycle time variable is excluded, since it is insignificant in Table 9
and since it jumps around implausibly when included in the adjacent—year equations.

The price indexes for the 1965—72 period are shown in Table 11. The first three
columns list the indexes implied by the time dummy coefficients in Table 9 for the

augmented Phister sample. The annual rate of price change in column (3), our
preferred variant, is —15.9 percent, somewhat less than the —18.4 percent rate of price

change for 1954—65 in the preferred equation for the Chow sample. The rate of price

decline is similar in columns (1) through (3), all referring to the augmented Phister

sample. For the new sample in columns (4) and (5) the rate of price decline is faster
but displays implausible jumps in 1968 and 1971. Columns (6) and (7) display, for the
pooled and adjacent-year regressions respectively, the results when the MD 1970

dummy is included and the speed variable is excluded. This specification yields a

slightly smoother index and a slower rate of price decline in the pooled results, and a
much smoother index with a much faster rate of price decline in the adjacent—year
results. Interestingly, the ten—fold decline in the adjacent—year index in column (7)

of Table 11 is quite similar to Miller's geometric index for the same period, which has
1965

10.75 on a base of 1972

1.00 (see Table 16 below) By taking column (3)

rather than column (7) of Table 11 as our "final" index for this period, we may be

understating the rate of price decline.

Next we turn to the 1972—77 period in Table 12. Note that there is a highly
significant IBM dummy in both the Dulberger and Phister samples. Also, without the
technology variables, the Dulberger sample registers a price increase in 1973—75 over

1972, and very little price decline from 1972 to 1977. The rate of price decline in the
Phister sample with no dummies is actually smoother than in the best Dulberger

equation (col. 3), but a jump in the coefficient on the 1973 time dummy occurs in the
augmented Phister sample with either the IBM dummy or size dummies included.

To maintain comparability to the Dulberger sample for this period, we present

only the results for the augmented Phister sample that contains old models. We do
not present a companion set of results for new Phister models only, since we learned
that the hedonic price indexes derived from the Phister sample of new models for this
period display implausible jumps, and we were not able to eliminate these jumps even
after experimentation with model dummies and adjacent-year equations. The price

indexes for 1972—77 are displayed in Table 13. The two preferred price indexes are in

columns (3) and (4). The price index for the Dulberger sample with technology
variables included (column 3) displays an annual rate of change of —15.6 percent, and
for the augmented Phister sample (column 4) —22.1 percent.

Finally, we have the 1977-84 period in Table 14. The Dulberger sample is run
separately, because we have the technology class variables available only for those
observations. Also, we did not have data on MIPS for the non—IBM sample for 1977-

80 but instead created it. First, a regression of MIPS on machine cycle time was run
for 1981—84 (since we have both MIPS and machine cycle time for that period) and

then the estimated coefficients are used to create values for MIPS for 1977—80, when

we know only machine cycle time. The sample is tripled in size when the Dulberger
observations for IBM machines are merged in column (4) with the rest of the

Computerworld observations. The main differences in results for the large sample are
that the IBM dummy is close to significance and that the coefficient on memory

jumps. Unlike the Dulberger sample, which displays the property that the coefficients
on memory and MIPS sum to unity, the sum for the Computerworid sample in column
(4) 1.15.

Several other regression equations with the Computerworid data are included in
columns (5) through (7) of Table 14. When the pooled equation in column (4) is
compared with separate equations for non—super—minis (column 5) and super—minis

(column 7) decisively rejects aggregation, with a F(6,544) ratio of 55.7. However, a
similar test for the aggregation of IBM and non—IBM mainframes (i.e., nonsuper—minis)

accepts aggregation. While there is no need to run a separate regression for the
non—IBM and non—super—mini subset of the Computerworld sample, it is interesting to

note in column (6) that the rate of price decline is somewhat slower for this subset.
In addition, for this subset (and for super—minis) we include three additional variables
beyond the usual measures of speed and memory: maximum and minimum channels and

"cache buffer size." The coefficients on these additional variables are highly

significant and of the correct sign.

The price indexes for this final period are presented in Table 15. The annual
rate of change for the Dulberger sample with technology variables (column 3) is —20.4
percent over 1977—84, for the merged sample in column (4) is —25.8 percent, for the
sample excluding super—minis in column (5) is -23.4 percent, for the non—IBM

mainframes in column (6) is —19.7 percent, and for the super—minis in column (7) for

1981—84 only is -17.7 percent. Note that the rate of price change for non-IBM models

from the Computerworid sample is very close to the result from the Dulberger sample

for IBM machines. These results suggest that the rate of price decline for computer

previous 20 years.
VII. WEIGHTING ISSUES

Numerous price indexes for computer processors have been developed in this
study for four separate time periods, 1951—65, 1965—72, 1972—77, and 1977—84. In this

section we choose one index from each of the periods and combine them into a single
index covering the 1951—84 period. The "final" price index developed here is then

aggregated together with BEA price indexes for other products to form a new deflator
for the OCA (Office, Computing, and Accounting Machinery) component of PDE, and

for PDE itseLf. As suggested in the introduction to this paper, differences among the

alternative price indexes for computer processors that might be used in such an
exercise are trivial compared to the major impact of alternative methods of weighting.
Comparison with Other Results

In his survey paper in this volume, Triplett (1987) displays a wide variety of
hedonic price indexes for computers. Tables 16 and 17 compare the main results of

this study with alternative price indexes for the same sample periods. Table 16
covers the period through 1972, and Table 17 covers the period since 1977. The first
three columns of Table 16 link together our Phister indexes from Tables 8 and 11.
These are compared in column (4) to an index developed by Flamm (by an alternative
methodology that does not include the estimation of explicit hedonic regression

equations) from the Phister data; in column (5) to Triplett's "best practice" index that
combines Chow's results with those of Knight, and the hedonic results of Miller (1980)

that extends Chow's data set through 1972.

Computer Prices, Page 41

For the period 1958 through 1972, the overall rate of price decline in our new—
only adjacent year index from Phister (column 3) is very close to Flamm's index.
While columns (3) and (4) differ in the timing of price declines from 1965 to 1972, the
behavior of our column (3) index in 1965—66 and 1971—72 receives some corroboration

from Miller's index. Triplett's index displays a similar rate of price decline to column
(3) in 1955—65, but differs sharply from 1954 to 1955, Also, Triplett's index shows a

much faster rate of price decline between 1965 and 1966 than any of our indexes or
Miller's. The Phister augmented index in column (1) shows a slower overal rate of

price decline than any of the other indexes, both before and after 1965.
The comparison for the period since 1972 in Table 17 compares our indexes with
Dulberger's index as estimated for the full 1972—84 period (in contrast to our re—
estimate with her data for the separate 1972—77 and 1977—84 periods in Tables 12 and

14), and with Cartwright'g index based on a larger sample than Dulberger's. Our
results with the augmented Phister sample, shown in columns (1) and (2), show a much
greater rate of price decline for the 1972—77 period than either Dulberger or
Cartwright. For the period since 1977, our Computerworid index that excludes super—

minis declines at exactly the same rate as Dulberger's index, and at a slightly faster

rate than Cartwright's index. In the next section we discuss the selection of
preferred indexes to be included in our "final" computer index.
The "Final" Price Index for Computer Processors
To compile a single price index for the 1954—65 period, we combine four indexes

with a piece of a fifth. A list of these indexes and their location in the preceding
set of empirical tables is contained in the notes to Table 18. The first index,
covering 1954—65, is our estimated equation from Chow's data that includes an IBM

dummy. We prefer Chow's data set to the Phister data set, simply because its sample

Computer Prices, Page 42

size is larger, and it yields smoother price indexes. For 1965—72 we use an equation

for the augmented Phister sample that contains dummy variables for large and small
memory sizes. While this index declines much slower than the adjacent—year index for

the new Phister sample, we feel that the reliance by other investigators (including
Triplett and Miller) on data sets that include only new models yields inconsistent

results with the preferred indexes for the period since 1972 that include both new ano
old models. Since our chosen index for 1965—72 declines more slowly than any of the

other indexes in Table 16, our "final" index probably understates the overall postwar
rate of price decline.
The 1972—77 equation is for the Dulberger data, using her technology variable.

This equation does not duplicate the final regression index in Dulberger's paper,
shown in Table 17, column (4), since she estimates a single equation over the full

1972-84 period rather than breaking that interval into two sub—periods as in this
paper). The equation used for 1977—84 is for the merged Dulberger and

Computerworld data set. This equation seems preferable to relying exclusively on

Dulberger's results, since our merged sample size is much larger than hers, and
includes not just mainframes but also super—minis (recall from Table 1 that in 1984
the value of mini—computer sales had reached 40 percent of mainframe sales). While
this equation includes super—minis, which should not be combined with mainframes

according to the F test described above, we adopt it as a short—cut to avoid the
necessity of weighting together separate mainframe and super—mini indexes. Finally,

the "final" index is extended back from 1954 to 1951 by using the time dummy
coefficient from the equation estimated on the augmented Phister data for 1951—65.

The resulting "final" index is displayed in Table 18, where it is compared with
the IBM regression index estimated by Cole et. al. (this is the same as Dulberger's

index for 1972-84 with technology variables included). Also included in the

comparison is the index for computers and peripherals used by the BEA to deflate the
OCA segment of PDE, which extends back to 1969 and is assumed to remain

unchanged before that year. It is interesting to note that the rate of change of our
index and the IBM index over the 1972-84 period is much faster than the BEA index,

which includes peripherals as well as processors. While we do not have the
underlying components of the BEA index, we can assess its plausibility by comparing

it with indexes for peripherals published by Cole et. al. (1986):

One reason for the relatively slow rate of decline of the BEA index is the use of
"composite"

indexes based on matched models when a model exists in both the current

year and base year and hypothetical prices from hedonic equations for models that did
not exist in the base period. The IBM composite indexes for both processors and
peripherals decline more slowly than the corresponding regression indexes based on

37. Weights used were 60 percent for disk drives, and 20 percent each
for printers and displays, based on current value figures listed in Current
Industrial Reports, Office, Computing, and Accounting Machines, 1973.

Computer Prices, Page 44

estimated time—dummy coefficients, with a difference of 1.4 percentage points at an

annual rate for processors, 4.3 points for disk drives, 1.8 points for printers, and 0.0
points for displays. Nevertheless, the rate of decline of the BEA index seems
implausibly slow.38

Since this paper does not create new price indexes for peripherals, and since
such indexes are not available before 1972, we will proceed on the assumption that

our index for processors can be used for the aggregate of processors and peripherals.
While the IBM indexes for peripherals decline more slowly than the IBM indexes for

processors, there are three offsetting factors that cause our price indexes to
understate the rate of decline of computer prices. First, we make no allowance at all

for the value of reduced repair, energy, and maintenance costs on computers. In a
study of postwar price changes of TV sets, I have found that allowance for the value
of such cost savings increases the rate of price decline over the 1947—84 period from
—4.2 to —6.6 percent per annum, and I would be surprised if savings of a similar

magnitude were not achieved on computer equipment. Second, to the extent that
price reductions were more rapid on mini and micro (i.e., PC—type) computers than on

mainframes, a "true" price index for computer processors would decline more rapidly

than the processor index developed here which has no coverage of micro computers at
all or of mini computers before 1977. We shall present information on price changes

for PCs in Table 23, discussed below. Third, Table 1 above documents that after 1966

the growth in the number of mainframe units purchased was very slow relative to the
growth in the number of mini and micro units purchased. Clearly, many computer

38. If a weight of 50 percent is given to processors and the remainder is
distributed among peripherals with the weights given in the previous footnote,
the weighted average of the IBM composite indexes registers an annual rate of
change of -14.8 percent, not the —13.7 percent registered by the BEA index.

Computer Prices, Page 45

users found that the increased power of minis and micros allowed them to perform

certain tasks at a lower cost. The price reduction implicit in this shift in mix is not
taken into account in any of the indexes for computer processors developed in this

paper or by others.
Aggregating the Computer Index into a Deflator for OCA

The three right—hand columns of Table 18 display three alternative deflators for
the OCA component of PDE. The first is the implicit BEA deflator, and the second is
a "hybrid't deflator that combines our computer processor index with the BEA index
for "other OCA" (i.e., non—computer products within OCA like cash registers and

typewriters), using BEA weights and the implicit deflator methodology for combining
the two components of the OCA deflator. The BEA and hybrid OCA deflators are

identical until 1960, despite the marked difference in the underlying computer indexes

displayed in columns (2) and (3) of Table 18. This occurs because the BEA uses the
following formula for computing the implicit OCA deflator:
BEA

where

W

WC(PC)

+ W0(P0),

VC,PC and WO

VO/PO,

and where each variable refers to the current time period, and the price indexes "P"
are expressed with 1982 as base year. Here "W" is the weight expressed in 1982

Computer Prices, Page 46

in 1982 prices mean that the current value weight of computers is divided by larger
and larger pC numbers as one proceeds back into the 1970s and 1960s. The BEA's
own current-value weight for computers within OCA is 45 percent for 1962, but the

computer weight W (expressed in 1982 prices) is just 4 percent for that year. Worse
yet, price changes from one year to the next are not calculated by averaging changes
of component indexes. Instead the level of the OCA deflator is calculated relative to
1982 separately for each year. This means that the change of the OCA deflator from

1957 to 1982 is identical to that for "othert' products, since the computer weight is
zero for 1957, and the price decline of computers between 1957 and 1982 has
absolutely no impact on the recorded change of the OCA deflator over that interval.

For a year like 1971 when computers have a substantial 33 percent weight, the

computer deflator of 474 is averaged together with the "other" deflator of 79, to yield
an OCA deflator of 188.

Because the implicit deflator methodology treats separately each year relative to
1982, year—to-year changes produce nonsensical results. As the weight on the
computer deflator increases through the 1960s, the BEA deflator for OCA increases

rapidly even though computer prices are fixed and "other" prices increase very slowly.
For instance, in 1962 the BEA deflator increases at an annual rate of 21.2 percent,
which bears no resemblance to an average of the zero rate of change assumed for
computers and the 8.4 percent decline for "other" products in OCA. It is important
to note that this implicit deflator weighting technique will create nonsensical results

for any computer index, not just the BEA index. Table 20 illustrates the same rapid
rise in the "hybrid" OCA deflator, which uses our new computer processor index,
occurs in 1959—72.

It should be emphasizes that the implicit deflator is only one of two indexes for

Computer Prices, Page 47

OCA published by the BEA. Table 7.13 of the NIPA publishes a fixed-weight deflator

for OCA which, as shown in the right-hand column of Table 19, does not display the

nonsensical properties of the implicit deflator. We emphasize the pitfalls of the

implicit deflator methodology in this section for two reasons. First, the implicit
deflator for OCA was the only deflator displayed by Cartwright (1986) and is referred

to by him as "the" BEA deflator. Second, and more important, the implicit deflator
by definition is used to convert nominal investment expenditures into real investment
expenditures. Thus any evaluation of the effects on real OCA investment or real PDE
investment of introducing computer prices into the NIPA will be flawed for the same

reasons that the implicit deflator is flawed.
The results of a much more sensible method of weighting are illustrated in Table

21. To avoid dependence of the results on a particular base year like 1982, the
percentage changes in our computer price index and in the BEA "other OCA" deflator

are weighted together using current value weights for the share of computers and
other within OCA.39 This technique can be called a "chain—linked Laspeyres" index,

since the value weight used is for year t when the percentage change of each
component is calculated from year t to year t+1. The resulting OCA index falls
relative to the BEA index, as shown in the comparison of the implicit BEA deflator in
Table 19 with the right-hand column of Table 21.

Three graphs are provided to

summarize these results. Figure 2 shows how the BEA weighting technique causes its
OCA deflator to rise relative to either of its components between 1958 and 1971.
39. We use the BEA weights from 1966 to 1984. For 1951—65, we have

created our own weights by taking the ratio of the value of U. S. computer
shipments from Phister (1979) to total current-dollar OCA, and linking that ratio
to the BEA weight in 1966. This procedure results in a higher current—value
weight on computers in the 1950s and early 1960s. For instance, our current—
dollar weight for computers in OCA in 1958 is 15 percent, as compared to the
BEA's implausibly small value of 0.5 percent.

the difference between our index for OCA and the corresponding BEA index is

negligible before 1957, and is much larger between 1957 and 1972 than after 1972.

This is not surprising, since the BEA lacks a computer price index before 1969, and
the implicit deflator weighting technique yields a spurious increase in the OCA

deflator during this interval.
As for the PDE deflator implied by these OCA deflators, it is necessary to make
the calculations using the chain—linked Laspeyres method, since a recalculation of the
PDE deflator using the BEA's method with a 1982 base—year yields the same type of

distortion as occurs in their calculation of the OCA deflator. As shown here; the
difference between our PDE deflator and the flEA deflator for PDE is roughly the
same in 1957—72 as in 1972—84. This occurs because the large difference between the

VIII. CONCLUSION

Personal Computers

There are few people in the academic profession who have not observed the

rapid descent in the prices of personal computers and peripherals in the 1980s.

It would be very difficult to compile the data required for a hedonic price index of
PC processors and peripherals, because the number of relevant quality characteristics

is very large, and so a large sample would be necessary to obtain sensible coefficient
estimates. However, a matched—model index can be created from a much smaller

sample of observations, and the results of a "pilot study" are shown in Table 23. For
1981-84 the only information shown in the table is the price decline for an IBM PC

equipped with a standard and fixed configuration. For price changes covering 1984-85
and 1985—86, we have access to issues of PC magazine for early November in each of

the three years.
As explained in the notes to Table 23, price changes for 1984—85 and 1985—86

were calculated from advertisements of mail—order firms for several of the most
popular models of IBM and IBM—compatible processors and peripherals. Each change
that is labelled "Matched Model" (MM) compares identical models and configurations.

The "Matched Characteristics" (MC) comparisons allow the purchaser to switch from

brand—name equipment to "clones" in the first year that such a choice is available.
Obviously the MC comparisons make no allowance for possible quality differences in

brand—names and clones in warranties, quality of instruction manuals, or other

dimensions, and presumably the "true" price decrease as perceived by a purchaser lies
somewhere in between the MM and MC indexes.

For processors the resulting price decreases appear to be slightly more rapid
than the IBM computer processor index in Table 18, and about the same as for our

final processor index. The results for peripherals are mixed, with much faster rates
of price decline in 1984—85 than for the peripherals studied by Cole et. al. (1986) for
1972—84, but quite similar rates of price decline in 1985—86 as in the Cole study. The

next research task should be an attempt to collect analogous MM and MC measures of
price change for years before 1984—85.

Implications and Agenda for Future Research

This study has developed new price indexes for mainframe computers covering
the period 1951—84, including supermini computers for the period 1979—84. The

resulting rates of price change are almost identical to the original Chow study in
1954—65, somewhat slower during 1965-77, and more rapid again during 1977—84. The

new price index for computer processors is aggregated into a deflator for the Office,
Computing, and Accounting Machinery (OCA) component of Producers' Durable

Equipment (PDE), using both the BEA implicit deflator weighting methodology and the

more sensible chain—linked Laspeyres alternative. Possibly the most dramatic result in

this study is not the rate of price decline in the price index for computer processors,
which is of the same order of magnitude as in some other studies covering parts of
the postwar period, but the finding that the implicit BEA deflator for OCA overstates

the rate of price increase at an annual rate of 16.4 percent during the period 1957—

72. Primarily weighting issues also account for a 4.4 percentage point excess in the
rate of price decline in our OCA deflator than in the BEA OCA deflator for the more
recent 1972—84 period.

Computer Prices, Page 51

When these alternative OCA deflat.ors are aggregated into deflators for all of
PDE, the differences are much more modest, amounting to about three—quarters of one

percent for the period since 1957. There is little difference in the contribution of
our new indexes to the PDE deflator for 1957—72 and 1972—84, since the growing

weight of OCA offsets the shrinking size of the difference between our OCA deflator

and that of the BEA. The fact that our PDE deflator registers about the same
difference from the BEA deflator for PDE in 1957—72 as in 1972—84 suggests that the

results of this paper have few if any implications for the post—1972 slowdown in U. S.
productivity growth.

However, this paper is only a small part of a much larger study of durable goods

prices covering the entire postwar period. Preliminary results from that study
indicate that our new deflator for PDE, based on more than 100 products covering 15
of the 22 components of PDE (including OCA), increases at an annual rate 3

percentage points less than that of the current BEA PDE deflator. Of this difference,
the results for computers account for about one—quarter (i.e., for 0.75 times 3.0), and

the remaining revisions are accounted for by the remaining products.
