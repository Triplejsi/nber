Interpreting the Evidence on Money-Income Causality

ABSTRACT

Previous authors have reached puzzlingly different conclusions about the
usefulness of money for forecasting real output based on closely related

regression-based tests. An examination of this and additional new evidence
reveals that innovations in Ml have statistically significant marginal
predictive value for industrial production, both in a bivariate model and in a

multivariate setting including a price index and an interest rate. This
conclusion follows from focusing on the trend properties of the data, both
stochastic and deterministic, and from drawing inferences using asymptotic
theory that explicitly addresses the implications of these trends for the
distributions of the various test statistics.

1. Introduction
Whether movements in money help to predict movements in output or income
has been an enduring topic in macroeconomics. This question has traditionally
been associated with the monetarist-Keynesian debate over the effectiveness of

monetary policy. Recently, however, some authors have suggested that
equilibrium models in which aggregate movements have real rather than monetary
origins imply that money should have limited value for forecasting output
(King and Plosser [1984], Bernanke [1986], and Eichenbaum and Singleton

[1986]). Since Sims' (1972, 1980a) seminal articles, empirical investigations
into this relation have focused on whether money "Granger causes" output in
either a bivariate or a niultivariate framework.

Unfortunately, researchers using only slightly different specifications
have reached disconcertingly different conclusions using postwar U.S. data.
Focusing on systems with money, output, prices and interest rates, these

different findings can be summarized as three puzzles. First, in a threevariable system with log output, log money, and inflation and in a fourvariables system in which an interest rate is added, Eichenbauni and Singleton

(1986) found sharp reductions in the importance of money when the tests were
performed using log differences of the variables rather than log levels with a
time trend.

Second, Sims (l980b) found that adding an interest rate to the three
variable system (output, money and price) reduced the fraction of the

variation in output explained by innovations in money. As Bernanke (1986)
emphasized, however, when a time trend is added to this regression, King
(1984, Appendix B) and Runkle (1986) (using a linear time trend) and Litterman

-1-

and Weiss (1985) (using a quadratic time trend as well) report a substantial
increase in this fraction, indicating an increased predictive role for money
in the four-variable system.

Third, the conclusions appear sensitive to the sample period. For example,
Eichenbaum and Singleton (1986) emphasize that the evidence supporting a
causal role for money in a detrended levels specification is much weaker in a
sample that excludes the 1980's than if the 1980's are included (for a further
discussion see King [1984, Appendix B], Christiano and Eichenbaum [1986] and
Stock [1986]).

At the heart of the first two puzzles is the use of different techniques to

"detrend" time series that arguably contain unit roots. Christiano and
Ljungqvist (1987) and Ohanian (1986) have recently provided Monte Carlo
evidence that nonstandard "unit root" distributions might play a role in

resolving these puzzles. Specifically, Christiano and Ljungqvist (1987)
compute the distribution of a levels causality test statistic in a bivariate
model of money and output under the assumption that money and output are not
cointegrated, but have unit roots and drifts; they find a substantial
rightward shift in the distribution of the F-statistic under the null of no

causality. Ohanian reports similar 'unexpected' distributional shifts in a
Monte Carlo experiment with a VAR including money, output, prices, an interest

rate, and an artificially generated independent random walk. While these
authors offer no theoretical explanation for their Monte Carlo results, their
findings suggest that nonstandard distribution theory may prove central to
reconciling the empirical puzzles.

Our objective is to develop an explicit empirical characterization of
money, output, prices, and interest rates that resolves these three puzzles

-2-

and permits us to draw conclusions concerning the money-output relation in

postwar U.S. To facilitate the application of existing asymptotic
distribution theory, we focus on Granger causality tests rather than variance
decompositions.

Our key finding is that although the growth of Ml itself does not Granger
cause real growth in the industrial production index, the deviation of money

growth from a linear time trend does. This result obtains in a bivariate
system with money and output, in a trivariate system in which we add prices,
and in a four variable system in which we add interest rates.

Moreover, the

key restriction that appears to be rejected is the neutrality of output to

changes in detrended money growth. This finding is robust to changes in the
sample period, to estimation using two, three, and four-variable
specifications, and to changes in the number of lags in the relevant
regressions.

The analysis focuses on the effects of different detrending techniques when

the regressors contain some unit roots. Our first step, reported in Section
2, is to ascertain the orders of integration and cointegration of the
variables, as well as whether the series appear to have polynomial time

trends. We use monthly data from January 1959 to December 1985, with

industrial production as the output measureJ Consistent with the findings of
other researchers, over the postwar period in the U.S. each of these variables
appears to contain one unit root, possibly with drift, so that (for example)

output growth is stationary. In addition, money growth (mt, where

denotes

the log of nominal Ml) seems to be well described as being stationary around a

small but statistically significant time trend. That is,

-3-

= l + y2t +
where

is a stationary, mean zero process. Thus

"detrended nominal money growth't; alternatively,

can be thought of as
is the stochastically

trending component of money. Using the results of this analysis, in Section 3
we provide direct evidence that Lip Granger causes

Moreover, the growth

in detrended money is found to be non-neutral, in the sense that (treating

p

as exogenous and the parameters of the VAR as constant) a permanent increase
in the level of

leads to a statistically significant predicted permanent

increase in industrial production.2
In Section 4, the characterization of Section 2 and the theoretical results
of Sims, Stock and Watson (1986) are used to address the first two puzzles.
According to Sims, Stock and Watson (1986), the asymptotic distribution theory

can be used to interpret F-tests in two cases: (i) the restrictions being
tested can be expressed as restrictions on mean zero, stationary variables, or
(ii) the restrictions involve some variables that are dominated by a
polynomial in time (and perhaps some additional variables that are mean zero
and stationary), but there are no other linear combinations of regressors that

are dominated by stochastic trends. Otherwise, the F-statistics will have
nonstandard distributions. In particular, these results imply that causality
tests computed from regressions involving levels of the data typically will
have nonstandard distributions.
These theoretical results are applied to the different specifications in

the literature. When they are warranted, we use the usual p-values,
predicated upon asymptotic normality; when they are not, the p-values are
computed by numerical integration of the nonstandard asymptotic distributions.

-4-

The proposed resolution of the first two puzzles involves both these
distributional issues and the finding of Sections 2 and 3 that detrended money

growth is non-neutral with respect to output growth. Thus the differences in
conclusions drawn from the various specifications arises partly because of
previously incorrect asymptotic inference in the levels regressions, and
partly because including time as a regressor allows the dominant component of
money growth (its time trend) to be stripped away, revealing the stochastic
component (Eipt)

that

has predictive value for industrial production.

The final puzzle is addressed in Section 5 by repeating the analysis of

Sections 2-4 for a shorter sample ending in September 1979. For this shorter
period, inflation is better characterized as being stationary around a time

trend. This accounts for many of the observed changes in the causality Fstatistics. While the neutrality proposition is rejected for this shorter
sample, upon controlling for the predictive value of the Treasury Bill rate
appears to have less predictive content for industrial production in the
shorter than in the longer sample.

Our conclusions are summarized in Section 6.

2. Trend Properties of the Data

Sims, Stock and Watson (1986) show that the asymptotic distributions of
neutrality and causality tests are sensitive to unit roots and time trends in

the series. This suggests that the finite sample distributions of these tests
will depend on trending or Ituflit roottt behavior as well. Since the asymptotic

theory will be used below to approximate these sampling distributions, we

-5-

begin by characterizing the time trend and unit root properties of the data.

The data consist of monthly observations on the log of nominal Ml (m), the log
of industrial production (y), the log of the wholesale price index (p) (not
seasonally adjusted), and the secondary market rate on 90-day U.S. Treasury

Bills (r), obtained from the Citibase data base. Stated sample lengths refer
to the estimation period, with earlier observations being used for initial
conditions as necessary.

It is now widely recognized that many macroeconomic series appear to

contain unit roots (e.g. Nelson and Plosser [1982], Perron [1986], Perron and

Phillips [1986], Stock and Watson [l986a,b]). Table 1 investigates the
possibility that these series might have up to two unit roots and time trends

up to second order. The first column presents a modification of the StockWatson qf test (described in Appendix A) for a single unit root when there
might be a quadratic time trend; in no case is there significant evidence

against the unit root hypothesis. The next two columns present the results of
Stock-Watson and Dickey-Fuller (1979) tests for a second unit root, i.e. for a
unit root in the first difference of the series, allowing for the alternative
that the series is stationary in first differences around a linear time trend.

According to these tests, no series contains two unit roots.3
To ascertain the order of the polynomial in time, the first difference of
each series was regressed against a constant, time, and six of its own lags
(the latter to obtain correct standard errors); the t-statistics on the time

trend are reported in the sixth column of Table 1. Money growth exhibits
clear evidence of a trend, so that m is well characterized by a single unit

root and a quadratic time trend. Performing the same test without a time
trend (column seven) indicates that while output growth and inflation have

significant drifts, the interest rate does not.

Since output growth, inflation and the interest rate appear not to exhibit
time trends, the fourth and fifth columns of Table 1 reports tests for a unit
root in levels, allowing only for the process to be stationary around a linear

time trend under the alternative. Again, all tests fail to reject. We
conclude that, over the 1960,2-1985,12 sample, y and p are well described as
processes having a single unit root with drift; r has a single unit root
without drift; and m has a single unit root and a quadratic time trend, i.e.
it has the univariate representation (1).

Multivariate representations of these data will thus be characterized by a

quadratic time trend and at most as many unit roots as variables. However, if
the series have stochastic trends in common, their multivariate
representations will be cointegrated as defined by Engle and Granger (1985)

and so will contain a reduced number of unit roots. However, tests for
cointegration among these data (reported in panel B of Table 1) fail to reject
the null that the series are not cointegrated, suggesting that the
multivariate specifications have as many unit roots as variables.4

summarizes the empirically observed unit root and time trend results of

Table 1. Before turning to the empirical results about the coefficients in
(3), it is worth noting two points. First, a simple calculation using the
definition of A*(L) shows that, if the unit root and non-cointegration
restrictions are true, then the restriction that

does not enter the output

equation in (2) implies and is implied by the restriction that

does not

enter the output growth equation in (3). This is not to say that the test
statistics in the two regressions will have the same numerical values, or even
the same asymptotic distributions -

- just

that the restrictions are the same

in population. Second, (2) and (3) are not quite VAR's in the original
variables: upon premultiplying (2) by A(L), or (3) by A*(L), polynomials in
time remain in the specification.

3. Evidence of Non-neutrality

This section provides empirical evidence for the proposition stated in the
introduction that industrial production growth is not neutral to changes in

the growth rate of detrended money. Consider the output growth equation in a
bivariate VAR(p) of money and output in first differences:

Yt =

(4)

yi

+

+ flyy(L)yl + ft

The usual test for Granger causality tests the p restrictions that

9(L)=O.

One of the restrictions being tested is that money is "neutral" in the sense

that (l)=O. To focus on this restriction, note that

L)(l)-FP(L)(l-L) (where ymj

i=j+lymi

thus (4) can be

rewritten as

(I)

Yt yi +

(l)mti + (L)2m1 + yy(L)Ly1 +

where 2E(l-L)2. Thus a t-test on the coefficient

in (I) provides a

simple test of the hypothesis that
Since money growth contains a deterministic time trend, a test of
in (I) does not provide a direct test of the neutrality of detrended money

growth. This alternative hypothesis can be examined in a regression in which

Lm is replaced by the residual from regressing Lm on a constant and time; in
large samples, this should reflect more closely the effect of

Denoting detrended money growth by

m(L)2mti + /3(L)Ay1 +

Finally, a third approach to testing whether Lijz Granger causes

would

be to detrend all the regressors in (I). This could be done either in a
series of preliminary regressions, or by estimating

(III) Yt yi + fly2t + mt-l + (L)2mt i + (L)y1 + ft
The results of estimating (I)-(III) are presented in Table 2. According to
the analysis of Section 2, none of the regressors contain unit roots, although
in (I) and (III) the regressors include variables that are dominated by linear

time trends. Thus the usual standard errors and procedures of asymptotic
inference are valid and are used in the Table.

Focusing first on the bivariate relation, the neutrality proposition is

rejected in all three specifications. However, in the regressions with
detrended money the point estimate of ym(l) more than doubles, and the t-

statistic rises sharply. When the Granger causality proposition is tested
using the specifications (I)-(III), the predictive role of money is

substantially enhanced using the detrended data. The increase in the Fstatistic from (I) to (II) in Panel B is consistent with the proposition that
much of the power of the causality test arises from the non-neutrality of
which is tested only in specifications (II) and (III) (at least
asymptotically).

The results for the three- and four- variable systems are similar:

Notes: t-statistics in panel A are significant at the **l% *5% +10% level.
All statistics are based on regressions with p lags of money growth rearranged
as in (4) in the text, and with 12 lags of Ly, p, and Lr as appropriate,
where p=6 in the first panel and p=l2 in the second panel. In panel A, tstatistics are in parantheses, and in panel B p-values are in parentheses.
Significance levels and p-values are based on the usual asymptotic normal and
F approximations.

detrended money growth exhibits stronger non-neutrality, and thus more
evidence of causality, than does money growth itself.

In all systems, upon increasing the number of lags of money growth from six

to twelve, the point estimates of (l) rise somewhat, indicating a small but
positive sum of the coefficients on

for lags 7-12. The corresponding t-

statistics are slightly reduced, but for the detrended specifications they

typically remain significant at the 1% level. In contrast, increasing the
money lag length sharply reduces the Granger causality F-tests (although all

detrended specifications still reject at the 5% level). This is consistent
with the proposition that increasing the number of lags of money vitiates the
influence of the non-neutrality on the test statistic.5

4. The Puzzling Causality Tests

We return to the first two puzzles stated in the introduction by examining
the effects of different treatments of time trends and unit roots on F-tests

of the predictive content of money. Table 3 contains F-tests for the two,
three, and four variable systems for specifications using growth rates and log
levels, using different numbers of lags, and using different orders of
deterministic time trends.

The Sims-Stock-Watson guidelines can be used to ascertain which statistics

in Table 3 have the usual asymptotic distribution. In panel A all the
regressors contain unit roots and none are cointegrated. Since the
restrictions being tested cannot be represented as restrictions on mean zero,
stationary variables, the F-statistics will have nonstandard distributions.

Notes: p-values appear in parantheses. When just one p-value appears, it is
based on the usual aysmptotic approximation using the F distribution. When
two p-values appear, the first is based on the usual F distribution, and the
second is based on the nonstandard asymptotic distribution, computed
numerically as described in Appendix B.

In panel B the regressors other than money growth contain unit roots. When
time is included as a regressor (panel B, rows 2 and 3), the restrictions
being tested are effectively on detrended money growth, which is mean zero and

stationary, so the usual distributions apply. However, when time is excluded
(row 1), money growth is dominated by a time trend and a linear combination of
money growth and output is dominated by a stochastic trend, with which money

- in

growth is in turn correlated. Thus one of the restrictions being tested particular, the neutrality proposition that the sum of the coefficients on
money growth is zero - -

involves

a coefficient on a variable that is dominated

by a time trend, resulting in a nonstandard distribution. Finally, since none
of the regressors in panels C or D are dominated by stochastic trends, the

usual p-values apply. In the nonstandard cases, both the usual (incorrect) pvalues and the "unit roots" distribution p-values (computed as described in
Appendix B) are reported.
The first puzzle is that using detrended levels data yields substantially

larger F-statistics than using first differences with a constant. The gap is
particularly wide between the F-statistic based on a VAR(12) in differences
(panel D, row 1) - (1986) - -

and

the

specification examined by Eichenbauni and Singleton

the F-statistic based on a linearly detrended levels regression

with 6 lags of m and 12 lags of the other variables (panel A, rows 2 and 3):
in the four-variable system, the 12 lag differences regression has a p-value
of .141, while the detrended levels regression has an (incorrect) p-value of

.002. However, the findings reported in Section 2, along with the nonstandard
asymptotic distribution theory, provide a consistent interpretation of these
results.

Considering first the bivariate results, comparing panels C and D suggests

-

12

-

that the nonzero coefficients are those on the first lags: testing the
coefficients on later lags serves only to reduce the F-statistic, holding

constant the number of other variables in the regressions. In addition,
including time in the regression increases the F-statistic. These
observations are consistent with the implications of Table 2 that non-

neutrality of

is a key source of the Granger causality. If the unit root

assumption is correct, then the regressions with time trends in panels B and C
test the same causality restrictions, although the test statistics will differ

because of sampling variability: in fact, the reported tests under these
alternative specifications suggest a predictive role for money. Thus much of
the puzzling gap between the differences and levels specifications is largely
accounted for by using a F-test that focuses more directly on the neutrality
proposition, and by recognizing that it is detrended money growth that appears
to Granger cause output.

The analysis in the three- and four-variable case is similar. Those
specifications with 6 lags of money and 12 lags of the other variables which

test the neutrality of zt (panel B, rows 2 and 3; panel C, rows 2 and 3)
yield qualitatively similar results: all reject non-causality at the 5% level,
although the specific p-values vary among specifications as expected from
sampling error.

Comparing the usual and the nonstandard p-values for the detrended levels

regression suggests two general conclusions. First, the usual (incorrect) pvalues typically are "too small", i.e. the significance is overstated when the

unit roots nature of the distributions is ignored.6 Second, the (correct) pvalues in the levels regressions tend to be larger than the (correct) p-values

in the mixed levels/differences specification in panel B. A possible

-

13

-

explanation of this is that an additional restriction is being tested in the
panel A regressions - -

that

causes output growth - -

and

the level of money (or detrended money) Cranger
that this restriction is not violated, reducing

the power of the tests in panel A. However, the (correct) p-values in panel
A, row 3 are consistent with the p-values in the differences regressions in
panel C in which the restrictions on detrended money are tested (panel C, rows
2 and 3)•7

Summarizing, in a given system the nonstandard asymptotics and the

proposition that

rather than

itself Granger causes output growth

provides a consistent explanation for the larger F-statistics in the detrended
levels model.

The second puzzle concerns the importance of

when r is added in systems

with and without linear and quadratic trends. This puzzle arises from
comparing variance decompositions, but is reflected in the F-statistics in

Table 3 as well. Consistent with the variance decomposition puzzle, the gap
between the three- and four- variable F-statistics is less when trends are
added to the levels specification (panel A, row 1 vs. row 2); indeed, the Fstatistic increases from 3.46 to 3.65 when interest rates are added in the
specification with a trend, although the corrected p-values change only

slightly.8 This drop is consistent with the previous argument that detrended
money growth rather than Emt Granger causes output, since in this case both of
the levels regressions without a trend are misspecified, having omitted time

as a regressor. The relative direction of the bias resulting from omitting
time in the three- and four-variable systems is uncertain on a-priori grounds,
although this bias would be expected to have differenct effects in the two

systems. Thus the "explanation" of the second puzzle is simply that the

-

14

-

regressions in panel A, row 1 have omitted a variable (time) that the analysis
of Sections 2 and 3 suggests is important for isolating the permanent role of

money innovations in forecasting output growth. According to this view, the
specifications including time (and the nonstandard p-values) constitute the
correct basis for inference, in which the marginal predictive content of money
changes little when the interest rate is added.

The preceding analysis assumes that inflation and detrended money growth

are stationary. While these specifications were suggested by the tests of
Section 2, an alternative characterization of these series would be that both

have unit roots, perhaps with drifts. Are the previous conclusions sensitive
to this modification? Supposing first that inflation is integrated, the
corrected p-values for the levels regressions reported above would have been
computed incorrectly (since the incorrect number of unit roots was included in

the multivariate specification). However, the F-tests in the detrended
regressions in panels B, C and D would still have the usual asymptotic
distributions, since the restrictions could be written in terms of mean zero,

stationary variables (detrended money growth). This suggests that our main
conclusion - -

that

detrended money growth helps to predict industrial

production -- would be unchanged were inflation an integrated process. In
contrast, if money growth has a unit root, then all the reported tests would
involve restrictions on integrated variables, and none of the reported p-

values would apply. However, the discussion of Section 2 suggests that the
argument for this particular alternative characterization is weak.

5. Subsample Stability

This section addresses the third puzzle, the apparent instability of the

causality tests when the 1980's are eliminated from the sample. The
calculations reported in Sections 2-4 were repeated using data from January

1959 to September 1979. The results are reported in Table 4-6.
The integration, cointegration, and time trend tests (Table 4) yield the
same inferences as when the full sample is used, with one important exception:
during the shorter sample, inflation seems to be well characterized as

containing a linear time trend. While modeling inflation as having a linear
time trend in the shorter sample but as having no time trend in the larger
sample is logically inconsistent, the purpose of this initial "identification"
phase of the analysis is to obtain an empirical representation of the
variables that will serve as a framework for approximating the sampling

distributions using the Sims-Stock-Watson asymptotic theory. Since a linear
time trend appears to be an important empirical feature of inflation in the
shorter sample, we therefore adopt a characterization of the four variables
during 1959-1979 in which all contain unit roots, there is no cointegration,
and inflation -- as well as money growth -

with those using the shorter sample (Table 5, panel A), in both cases the

point estimate of /3(l) in the bivariate case doubles when a time trend is
added to the regression. In contrast, in the shorter sample the point
estimate changes little when a time is added in the three- and four-variable

specifications. This apparent discrepancy has a simple explanation in terms
of the identified trend in inflation in the shorter sample: when inflation
has a trend component, including inflation as a regressor is essentially

including time, plus some stationary errors, as a regressor. Thus inflation
detrends money growth, permitting the estimation of the sum of the
coefficients on a linear combination of
to the sum of the coefficients on

and

which is evidently close

alone.

The causality tests in panel B of Table 5 exhibit two major differences

from the corresponding tests in the longer period. First, these results
generally indicate less influence of money on output during the shorter

period, particularly using twelve lags. Second, given this generally
decreased influence, the major discrepancy between the F-tests in Tables 2 and
5 is the significant causation evident in specification (I) in the shorter

sample for the systems including prices. A possible explanation for this is

that detrended inflation (1r) helps to predict output growth. When time is
omitted from the regression, money growth is "detrended" by inflation. Thus
one of the restrictions being tested is that a linear combination of
-

if

- rather

than

Granger causes

itself -

and

- Cranger causes industrial production growth;

omitting the time trend would spuriously indicate a

greater role for money.

The full set of causality results (Table 6) also indicate a diminished role

for money in predicting output in this shorter sample. The first puzzle of

-

17

-

the introduction - -

the

difference in p-values between the differences and

detrended levels specifications --

is

still present in the bivariate results

(panel C, row 1 vs. panel A, row 2). The explanation is the same as before:
focusing on fewer restrictions on lagged money, detrending money growth, and
using the nonstandard critical values accounts for the apparent discrepancy.

In the multivariate models, however, this puzzle is reversed. One explanation
for this reversal is that given in in the discussion of Table 5, panel B; the
similarity of the (correct) p-values in the detrended differences and
detrended levels regressions with six lags of m support this view.
The

second

puzzle (adding a trend to the levels specification alters the

effect of money when interest rates are included) is summarized in panel A,

rows 1 and 2. The preceding analysis suggests that the anomolous resulthere
is the three-variable levels specification without a trend. Thus the
"explanation" of this puzzle is the same as in the longer sample, appealing to
the bias induced by omitting time as a regressor and to the overstatement of
the p-values arising from using the usual asymptotic theory.

Summarizing, when the time trend in inflation is recognized and when the
correct critical values are used, money appears to help forecast industrial

production in a bivariate model in both samples. However, its marginal
predictive content drops in multivariate settings in the shorter sample.
Since the point estimates of Bym(l) are similar across samples and across the
two-, three- and four-variable systems, this decrease appears to be
attributable to a combination of (i) relatively more of the short-run
movements in industrial production being explained by innovations in money
during the 1980's than before; (ii) increased variability in the regressors in
the 1980's, and therefore greater power in the F-tests; and (iii) simply

-

18

-

having more observations in the longer sample. In particular, using corrected
p-values, in the shorter sample the role of money drops substantially when
price is added to the specification, while it does not in the longer sample.
In contrast to Sims' (l980b) findings, the predictive value of money does not
change appreciably when an interest rate is added to the detrended
specifications in either sample.

6. Conclusions

The asymptotic p-values reported in Tables 3 and 6 have been computed under
specific assumptions about the unit root and trend behavior of the various

series. If these assumptions are incorrect, some or all of these asymptotic
p-values would be incorrectly calculated, depending upon the specific

assumption in question. This can be interpreted as a drawback of our two-step
procedure, first testing for trends, then calculating p-values conditional on

the trend specification. An alternative approach - -

at

least in theory - -

would be to specify a prior distribution over different trend
specifications,
to assume Gaussian innovations in the VAR's, and to compute posterior odds

ratios, integrating over the various cases. However, the computational burden
in this alternative approach is substantially greater than that entailed here;
for an application and discussion in a comparatively simple three lag

univariate autoregressive model, see Geweke (1986). More importantly, we
suggest that the major economic import of these results - the "neutrality" and Granger causality propositions -

- is

the

rejection of

largely unaffected

by this criticism. One message of Sims, Stock and Watson (1986) is that

-

19

-

certain linear combinations can be tested using the usual asyniptotics even if

there are unit roots. Our key results -- those in Tables 2 and 4 and in
Tables 3 and 5, Panel C, row 2 --

will

have normal distributions even if many

of our stochastic trend identifications are incorrect.

Subject to this caveat, these results suggest three conclusions. First,
innovations in the growth of nominal Ml are useful in forecasting industrial

production in the bivariate money-output relation. Second, over the entire
sample period monetary innovations have predictive value for industrial
production beyond information contained in prices and interest rates, although
the marginal significance levels rise somewhat in the multivariate systems.
Third, the additional role of money over prices and interest rates is
substantially less if attention is restricted to a shorter sample ending in

1979. However, the difference between the two samples might simply arise from
the greater variation in output, money, prices and interest rates over the
1980 and 1982 recessions, so that the tests in the longer sample would have
substantially more power.

This analysis suggests two reasons that past researchers have found

conflicting results. First, many of the earlier specifications failed to
focus on innovations to money, i.e. on the nondeterniinistic component of money

growth that we find to have predictive content for long-run movements in

industrial production. Second, incorrect p-values were used to analyze the
levels regressions, typically resulting in overstatements about the predictive

content of money. These observations provide consistent explanations of the
puzzles stated in the introduction.

Footnotes

1. 1959 was chosen as the start of the sample because of the change in
definitions of the monetary aggregates that year. While most other
researchers have used data from the 1950's and late 1940's, these earlier
series involve retrospectively constructed data that presumably contains
additional measurement error.

2. Our use of the terms "causality" and "neutrality" is narrow. By noncausality we refer only to the relevant zero restrictions in a VAR; we have no
intention of contributing to the large literature (reviewed by Geweke [1984])
discussing deeper interpretations of causality, predictability and exogneity.
Similarly, by neutrality we mean only the proposition that the sum of the
coefficients on lagged money - - or (detrended) money growth, depending on the
specification -- equals zero in the relevant regressions.
3. The unit root tests were repeated using twelve rather than six lags.
Generally similar results obtained, although with twelve lags it was more
difficult to reject the null that inflation has a second unit root. One
potential problem with inferences concerning inflation is that wholesale
prices exhibit substantial heteroskedasticity during the 1973-1975 oil price
rise and the lifting of price controls. We thus computed modified, weighted
Dickey-Fuller and Stock-Watson test statistics in which this
heteroskedasticity was modeled using a dummy variable for 1973,1-1975,1. With
both six and twelve lags, the weighted tests more strongly rejected the unit
root hypothesis; the largest root in inflation, after adjusting for
heteroskedasticity and short run serial correlation, was estimated to be .83.
This suggests that inflation is not integrated over the sample, although it
exhibits substantially greater dependence than (say) output growth.

cointegration tests.

6. This is consistent with Christiano and Ljungqvist's (1987) Monte Carlo
evidence on the bivariate money-output F-test in the levels regression without
a time trend.
7. The F-statistics of 2.65 in Table 3, panel C, row 1 and 6.07 in panel B,
row 1 for the bivariate models may at first seem contradictory, since both
correspond to coefficients on money growth excluding time trends from the
regression. However, these statistics in fact test different restrictions.
In the pure differences specification, money growth is dominated by its time
trend, and the neutrality of detrended money growth is not tested. In the
mixed differences/levels specification, money growth is "detrended" by
industrial production, which is dominated by a time trend. Thus this
statistic can be rewritten to test (among other restrictions) whether a linear

-

21

-

combination of detrended money growth and the stochastic part of output
Granger causes output. While this linear combination does appear to Granger
cause output, this still is not the hypothesis of interest (concerning
alone), which is untested until a time trend is included in the regression.

8. In finite samples, these F-statistics are only loosely linked to the
variance decompositions. In addition, as Runkle (1986) emphasizes, the
variance decompositions can be very imprecisely estimated, leading to spurious
inferences based on modest shifts in the variance decomposition point
estimates. Thus associating the second puzzle with the shifts in panel A of
Table 3 is only approximate.

Appendix A
Testing for a Unit Root with a Quadratic Time Trend

The Stock-Watson (1986a) q(k,m) statistic tests the null hypothesis that
a n-vector of time series variables has k unit roots, perhaps with drift,

against the alternative that the variables have among them only m<k unit

roots, perhaps with drift. This drift in the stochastic trends results in a
linear time trend in the series themselves plus a driftiess stochastic trend.
If it is suspected instead that the series might have a quadratic as well as a

linear time trend, the q(k,m) statistic is not applicable. Since money
growth appears to contain a linear time trend in the current application, the

q(k,m) statistic is inappropriate either for testing for a single unit root
in money or for testing for reduced unit roots in the multivariate systems.

We therefore adopt a modification of the Stock-Watson q(k,m) statistic that
can be used to test for k vs. m unit roots when there might be a quadratic
term under either the null or the alternative.

This modified statistic, termed q(k,m) in Table 1, is computed exactly
as is the q(k,ni) statistic, except that the data are first detrended using

a quadratic as well as a linear time trend. Selected critical values for the
statistic with m=k-i, computed as described in Stock and Watson (l986a) using
4000 Monte Carlo replications, are given in Table A-i.

Appendix B
Computation of Nonstandard p-Values

The marginal significance levels for the test statistics with nonstandard
distributions were computed by integrating numerically the limiting

distributions of these statistics. In general, the causality tests of the
type considered here with p restrictions have limits of the form,

(B.l)

F => [F1 +

F2(W(t);O)]/p

where F1 has a x.1 distribution, W(t) is n-dimensional Brownian motion,
where n is the dimension of the system, and 9 is a vector of parameters.

Except in special cases, 9 contains parameters from the entire VAR, including

the error covariance matrix. In addition, W(t) enters F2 only through a

limited number of functionals such as JW(t)W(t)'dtr and fW(t)dW(t)'W.

2].)

This representation, combined with Theorem 2.2 of Chan and Wei (1986) which
implies that F1 and W(t) (and thus F1 and F2) are independent, provides a
convenient formulation for Monte Carlo integration of the asymptotic

distribution. The specific procedure we adopt is an extension of Stock's
(1985) suggestion for computing the asymptotic distribution of least squares

estimators of cointegrating vectors when there is zero drift. Specifically,
the nonstandard p-values were estimated using the following algorithm:

Generate the functionals such as r and '

using

example, a draw of r is rT_T tlYtYt, where

(i)

sample path realizations; for
is a driftless n-

dimensional random walk with Y0=0 and an identity innovation covariance

matrix. We chose T to be 1000 and used a normal random number generator to

construct 4000 pseudo-random realizations of these functionals. (ii) Compute
an estimate

of the parameters 9 for the VAR in question.

(iii) Drawing

sequentially from the previously generated random matrices T' etc.), use
to construct a random realization of F2; add this to an independently drawn

x1 variate and divide the sum by p to construct a draw of F in (.l).
Step (iii) was repeated 4000 times for each estimated model, and the
(nonstandard) p-value was computed using the resultant empirical distribution
of F.

The programs for performing these computations are available from the
authors upon request.
