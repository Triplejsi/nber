Unsticking the Flypaper Effect Using Distortionary Taxation

JEL No. H21,H22,H41,H42,H62,H77
ABSTRACT
The flypaper effect is a widely-documented puzzle whereby the propensity of sub-national
governmental units to spend out of unconditional transfers is higher than the propensity to spend
out of private income. Building on previous insights in the literature that rationalize this puzzle
using costly taxation, we develop a simple optimal fiscal policy model with distortionary taxation
that generates two novel and testable implications: (i) there should be a positive association
between the size of the flypaper effect and the level of the tax rate, and (ii) the flypaper effect
should be larger the lower the elasticity of substitution between private and public spending and,
in fact, should vanish for very high degrees of substitution. We show that these hypotheses hold
for Argentinean provinces and Brazilian states.

The ypaper e¤ect results when a dollar of exogenous grant-in-aid leads to significantly greater public spending than an equivalent dollar of citizen income: Money
sticks where it hits. Viewing governments as agents for a representative citizen
voter, this empirical result is an anomaly.
Robert Inman (2008)

Introduction

The ypaper e¤ect is a well-known empirical regularity that refers to the greater responsiveness of subnational (i.e., state, provincial, city, or municipal) government spending to
increases in unconditional intergovernmental grants than to increases in local income. According to Inman (2008), over 3,500 research papers document this stylized fact for many
countries and levels of government in the world. Speci cally, these papers nd that an extra
dollar in personal income increases public spending by $0.02 to $0.05, while an equivalent
increase in intergovernmental transfers triggers a rise in spending that lies between $0.25 and
$1.1.1 The term ypaper e¤ect was originally coined in early papers (Henderson, 1968;
Gramlich, 1969) that uncovered this empirical regularity. This catchy expression captures the
idea that money sticks where it hits: money in the private sector  from private income 
tends to remain in the private sector rather than being taxed away, while money in the public
sector  from intergovernmental transfers  tends to be spent by the public sector rather than
being rebated to citizens.
As Inmans quote illustrates, the ypaper e¤ect has been regarded as a puzzle or an
anomaly. This is indeed the case if one thinks in terms of a model in which a representative
citizens utility is maximized subject to his/her full income  composed by the sum of personal income and his/her share of unconditional scal transfers. Such a model would predict
an identical propensity to spend out of citizens income or unconditional intergovernmental
transfers. After all, money is fungible and the source of nancing should not a¤ect the optimal
allocation of resources.
Explanations for the ypaper e¤ect have abounded and can be divided into ve di¤erent
groups, two of them pointing to potential speci cation errors and the remaining three based
on theoretical arguments. A rst group of explanations argues that non-fungible conditional

detailed surveys of the empirical evidence on the ypaper e¤ect.

transfers, like the ones American states receive from matching grants, are misclassi ed as
unconditional ones. A second group holds that omitted variables could also falsely support
the ypaper e¤ect if unobserved communitys characteristics, which a¤ect the technology or
e¤ective cost of public spending, were systematically related with citizens income (Hamilton,
1983). The ypaper puzzle, however, remains after using truly unconditional grants (Inman,
1971; Gramlich and Galper, 1973; Bowman, 1974) or controlling for population characteristics.
A third group holds that the standard model of a citizens scal choice might be misspeci ed
because either the citizen confuses the income e¤ect generated by unconditional transfers with
a price e¤ect that reduces the average e¤ective cost of public spending (Courant et al, 1979;
Oates, 1979), he/she is not fully informed and fails to see the public budget (Filimon et al,
1982) or, even when fully informed, he/she might not behave completely rationally (Hines
and Thaler, 1995). A fourth group uses political science arguments that exploit the role that
ine¢cient political institutions have in revealing citizens preferences (Chernick, 1979; Knight,
2002; Roemer and Silvester, 2002). Our paper relates to a fth (much less discussed) group
which relies on distortionary taxation (Hamilton, 1986; Aragón, 2009; Dalhby, 2011).2
Hamilton (1986) was the rst to point out theoretically that the ypaper e¤ect can arise
because subnational governments typically use distortionary taxes to nance at least part of
their expenditures. An increase in private income will lead to a greater demand for both public
and private spending. Public spending, however, requires larger tax revenues which can only
be raised by increasing the tax rate (i.e., distorting private sectors choices). In contrast, an
increase in transfers provides the government with a source of income that is (from the point
of view of the subnational unit) distortion-free. Hence, an increase in transfers will naturally
lead to higher public spending than will the same increase in private income. Since Hamiltons
(1986) contribution, however, there has been little work on the possible role of distortionary
taxation in explaining the ypaper e¤ect. Dalhby (2011) suggests that this might be in part
due to the early scepticism expressed by Hines and Thaler (1995) and Mieszkowski (1994)
and, implicitly, by Oates (1999). For example, Hines and Thaler (1995, page 221) argued
that the marginal deadweight losses from taxes are typically far too small to reconcile the
large di¤erences between propensities to spend. In turn, Oates (1999), in his comprehensive
review of the literature on scal federalism, does not refer to Hamiltons paper in discussing

the ypaper e¤ect (Dalhby, 2011, page 4).
More recently, Becker and Mulligan (2003) and Volden (2007) have developed political
economy models that exhibit a ypaper e¤ect because recipient governments rely on distortionary taxes to nance part of their spending. However, neither of these papers shows that
distortionary taxes can explain the magnitude of the ypaper e¤ect. More closely related
to our work, Dalhby (2011) presents a model in which the emphasis is on the marginal cost
of public funds and nds that, given reasonable parameters values, the model can explain
considerable part of the ypaper e¤ect. Unfortunately  and in sharp contrast to other explanations developed in the ypaper literature  there is little empirical evidence on the validity
of the distortionary taxation channel.
The main focus of our paper is precisely to present empirical evidence on the relevance
of the distortionary taxation channel. We develop a simple optimal scal policy model that
generates two novel and testable implications. First, there is a positive correlation between
the ypaper e¤ect and the level of the tax rate. In other words, when tax rates are high the
ypaper e¤ect is large and viceversa. This occurs because tax rates are positively associated
with the degree of tax distortion. When tax rates are low, the willingness to spend out of
transfers and local income is relatively similar because the tax distortion is low. As tax rates
increase so does the tax distortion, which increases the incentives to spend out of transfers
relative to local income. In other words, the size of the ypaper e¤ect follows directly from
the level of the tax distortion, which is positively associated with the level of the tax rate.
Second, the lower (higher) the elasticity of substitution between private and government
spending, the higher (lower) the ypaper e¤ect. If the elasticity of substitution is low, policymakers are much more willing to bear the tax distortion by imposing high tax rates, precisely
because government spending is not easily substitutable for private spending. Therefore, an
extra dollar of transfers will trigger an increase in government spending larger than an equivalent increase in income because the desire to allocate part of such extra dollar to government
spending is strong and because the tax distortion already borne is high. As the substitutability between public and private spending increases, the willingness to bear tax distortions
decreases because most resources could be more easily allocated to private spending without
any tax distortion cost. As a result, tax rates will decrease. Hence, as the substitutability
between private and public spending increases, the size of the ypaper e¤ect will shrink be4

cause the willingness to allocate part of such an extra dollar in government spending weakens
and, more importantly, because the willingness to bear tax distortions also diminishes. In
the extreme case of perfect substitutability between private and public spending, the ypaper
e¤ect vanishes.
We test the two predictions of the model by using two di¤erent datasets for Argentinean
provinces and Brazilian states. Unlike the American system of intergovernmental transfers
that are typically conditional on states spending in particular areas (mainly health and social
programs), Argentinean provinces and Brazilian states rely mostly on a tax-sharing system
regulated by laws that rarely change and whereby transfers are directly linked to federal tax
revenues. As it will become clearer later, Argentinean provinces and Brazil states receive
scal transfers that are, in essence, unconditional and exogenous to government spending.
Using a novel dataset on gross receipts from taxes that we put together from primary
sources in Argentinean provinces, we nd that the ypaper e¤ect is high when tax rates are
relatively high and signi cantly weakens as tax rates fall. We show this by splitting the sample
into provinces with tax rates above and below the median. While present in both samples,
the ypaper e¤ect is about 40 percent larger in the sample with higher tax rates.
We then test whether the ypaper e¤ect decreases with the degree of substitutability
between private and government spending by using di¤erent government spending categories.
To this e¤ect, we

rst follow a standard methodology in public

nance that allows us to

estimate the degree of publicness of di¤erent spending categories. Speci cally, we classify
di¤erent public spending categories for Argentinean provinces and Brazilian states into (i)
pure public goods, (ii) impure public goods, (iii) private goods, and (iv) undetermined. For
Argentina, for instance, we nd that police and housing/urban renewal are pure public goods,
while education and public welfare are private goods. We then test the degree of the ypaper
e¤ect for these di¤erent categories and nd that, by and large, the ypaper e¤ect is much
larger for pure public goods than for private goods, as predicted by our model.
The paper proceeds as follows. To set the stage for the discussion, Section 2 develops a
simple Ramsey model to illustrate the ypaper e¤ect as an anomaly. In a world with lumpsum taxes, the propensity of the Ramsey planner to spend out of private income or outside
transfers is the same. We then introduce distortionary taxation to illustrate the argument
put forward by Hamilton (1986) and show how the mere presence of distortionary taxation
5

is enough to generate the ypaper e¤ect. Section 3 develops a more general version of the
distortionary taxation model in which we identify two key testable empirical implications:
(i) there should be a positive correlation between the ypaper e¤ect and the level of the tax
rate, and (ii) the ypaper e¤ect should be larger (smaller) the lower (higher) the elasticity of
substitution between public and private spending. Section 4 briey describes scal federalism
in Argentina and Brazil and emphasizes the unconditional and exogenous nature of their scal
transfers. We then turn to the regression analysis. Section 5 establishes the strong presence
of the ypaper e¤ect. We then test our two key empirical implications in Sections 6 and 7
and nd strong support for them. Final thoughts are presented in Section 8.

Benchmark model

This section develops a simple Ramsey model of optimal scal policy model that allows us
to rationalize the ypaper e¤ect and understand the role of distortionary taxation. To keep
the model as simple as possible, we will think of a static economy inhabited by a benevolent
scal authority (FA) and a representative citizen or private agent (PA) blessed with perfect
foresight.3 There are two possible tax systems: (i) a non-distortionary lump-sum tax, and (ii)
a distortionary consumption tax.4

There are three (perishable) goods: a publicly-provided

good (g), a consumption good subject to taxation (cT ), and a consumption good not subject
to taxation (cN T ).5 These three goods are perfect substitutes in production and therefore the
two relative prices are one. Production is exogenous (i.e., there is an endowment).
Under a non-distortionary taxation system, the private agents budget constraint is given
3

Since this is a static model, it can be thought of as a closed economy.
Of course, solving the Ramseys planner problem with lump sum taxation is equivalent to solving the
social planners problem. (We set it up as a Ramsey problem to keep the symmetry with the distortionary
taxation case.) The social planners problem is the typical approach used in this literature (Henderson, 1968;
Gramlich, 1969; Knight, 2002; Inman, 2008). Speci cally, these papers maximize the representative citizens
utility subject to that citizens full income constraint speci ed as the sum of personal income and the
citizens share of his/her governments unconstrained scal transfers. In other words, resources are assumed to
be fungible.
5
There are di¤erent ways of introducing a tax distortion into the model. The most obvious alternative would
be to add leisure to the model, in which case a consumption tax would distort the consumption/leisure choice.
We prefer this alternative speci cation (with one good being taxed and the other not) because it enables us to
isolate the distortionary e¤ects stemming from (exogenous) income shocks. While not modeled, the good that
is non-taxed could be thought of as the underground economy. In a monetary model, our distinction between
taxable and non-taxable goods would correspond to the standard cash versus credit goods speci cation, wherein
ination taxes only cash goods.

In this section, we solve the Ramsey planners problem under (i) non-distortionary and (ii)
distortionary taxation. This strategy allows us to understand the ypaper as an anomaly
(case 1) and the role of distortionary taxation (case 2).

Unlike the non-distortionary case (section 2.1.1) the source of nancing does matter. An
increase in scal transfers increases government spending (private consumption) by a larger
(lower) magnitude than in the non-distortionary case, while an increase in income increases
government spending (private consumption) by a smaller (larger) magnitude than in the nondistortionary case (see equations (10), (11), (13) and (14)). That is to say, money sticks where
it hits.
An increase in income (y) increases the demand for both public and private consumption.
In order to nance the increase in government spending, the FA must increase tax collection.
Under distortionary taxation, any attempt to increase revenues by increasing the tax rate
would induce the PA to partially shift away from cT towards cN T . In fact

As a result, most of the increase in income is allocated to private consumption (see equation
(14)).
An increase in scal transfers (f ) also increases the demand for both public and private
consumption. However, in order to nance the increase in government spending, the FA does
not need to increase tax collection. Quite to the contrary, the FA decreases the tax rate in
order to allow part of those new resources to be allocated to private consumption

In other words, distortionary taxation generates the ypaper e¤ect by making it more
costly (in distortionary terms) to use funds that have accrued to the private sector than
funds that have been given to the government via scal transfers. While the assumption of
fungibility rules out the ypaper e¤ect in a non-distortionary world, it is actually consistent
with the ypaper e¤ect in a distortionary world (and, is in fact, the second-best).
As in Hamilton (1986), while this model rationalizes the ypaper e¤ect, it does not provide
clear testable implications. The next section modi es the models preferences in order to
obtain some testable implications that we can take to the data.

General model

This section generalizes the Ramsey planners problem from Section 2.1.2 by assuming more
general preferences. The rest of the model remains the same. As will become clear below,
these more general preferences will allow us to isolate the critical role of the elasticity of
substitution between public and private spending. Formally, let preferences be given by

where z represents a composite consumption good. The parameter  captures the elasticity of
substitution between taxable (cT ) and non-taxable (cN T ) goods, with a low  indicating little
substitution. As  becomes larger, taxable and non-taxable goods become more substitutable.

10

In the same vein, the parameter  captures the elasticity of substitution between public (g)
and private spending (z). Low values of  are associated with a low degree of substitution
between government and private spending. Moreover,9

(19)

When  ! 0 (i.e., cN T and cT tend to be consumed in xed proportions) the ratio cN T =cT
is highly inelastic to tax rate changes; while if  ! 1 (i.e., cN T and cT tend to be perfect
substitutes) then the ratio cN T =cT is extremely elastic to tax rate changes. The log case
corresponds to the case where the change in cN T =cT is proportional to changes in the tax rate
( = 1). The parameter  will thus capture how distortionary is the consumption tax system.

3.1

Results

Since the model cannot be solved analytically, we solve it numerically. To this end, we
formulate the Ramsey planners problem in very general terms. Speci cally, the Ramsey
planner chooses g, cT and cN T to maximize the PAs utility, given by (18), subject to the
implementability conditions derived from the PAs maximization problem, the PAs constraint
(2) and the FAs constraint (5).10
While our numerical exercise is not a calibration exercise, we choose the following parameterization that is consistent with the Argentinean case.11 We normalize output to one
hundred; i.e., y = 100. Some studies (Amano and Wirjanto, 1997; Chiu, 2001; Okubo, 2003;
Auteri and Constantini, 2010) estimate that the elasticity of substitution between private (z)
and government spending (g) ranges between 0.6 and 1.4; for this reason, we select  = 1 in
our benchmark parameterization.12 Unfortunately, there are no estimates for the degree of
substitutability between taxable and non taxable goods (). Since cT is the observed taxable
private consumption, we could think of cN T as the informal (i.e., underground) economy.
9

Appendix 9.2.3 shows this derivation.
Appendix 9.2.4 shows the Ramsey planner problem.
11
Similar results are obtained when calibrating the model for the Brazilian economy. Results are not shown
for brevity.
12
Using U.S. data, Amano and Wirjanto (1997) estimate an elasticity of substitution of 0.9, while Chiu
(2002) and Okubo (2003) nd values of 1.1 and 1.4 using Taiwanese and Japanese data, respectively. Based
on 15 Eurpean countries, Auteri and Constantini (2010) nd that this elasticity ranges between 0.59 and 0.76.
10

11

The informal economy comprises about 40 percent of actual Argentinean output (Schneider
and Enste, 2000; Vuletin, 2009).13 We also know that provincial government spending and
scal transfers represent about 16 and 7 percent of o¢cial output, respectively. Therefore,
government spending represents about 10 percent of actual output (i.e.,  = 0:10) and taxable
consumption represents about 54 percent of total consumption (i.e., q = 0:54). We set the
value of  such that it matches 2 ratios: cN T =y = 0:4 (i.e., the informal economy represents

40 percent of income) and g= y cN T = 0:16 (i.e., provincial government spending represents about 16 percent of o¢cial output). The elasticity of substitution between cT and cN T

consistent with these two ratios is about 3; i.e.,  = 3. This value seems reasonable since the
elasticity between private and public spending is much lower than the one between private
taxable and non taxable consumption. We then use this parameterization and allow  to vary
between 0 and 4. We do so because even though the elasticity of substitution between private
consumption and overall government spending seems to be close to unity, the elasticity across
several categories of goods varies. We should expect  to be close to zero in the case of pure
public goods and relatively high in the case of private goods that could potentially be publicly
provided.
Figure 1 (panel A) shows that an extra dollar of

scal transfers increases government

spending by a larger magnitude than an equivalent increase in citizens income.14

This

version of the model also rationalizes the ypaper e¤ect (panel B). More importantly, we nd
that the ypaper e¤ect is more important for low levels of  (i.e., when private and government
spending is hardly substitutable) and becomes less relevant as  increases (i.e., private and
government spending become more substitutable). This occurs because the tax distortion
(T D) and tax rate () observed for low levels of  are quite high and tend to decrease as 
increases (panels C and D). In other words, for low levels of , the scal authority needs to
spend a relatively large amount because public spending is not easily substitutable for private
one. To nance this spending, the FA sets a high tax rate and hence imposes a large tax
distortion. As suggested by equation (15), tax rates are positively associated with the tax
distortion. Under such circumstances, an increase in citizens income by a dollar increases
government spending by a smaller magnitude than an equivalent increase in scal transfers.
13
Estimates for the informal economy range between 8 and 30 percent for OECD countries and 13 and 76
percent for developing countries.
14
We would replicate the results obtained in section 2.1.2 if we assumed  = 1,  = 1,  = 1=3 and q = 1=2.

12

While a scal transfer shock decreases the tax distortion, an income shock increases it (panel
E). These last results also coincide with equations (16) and (17). As  increases, private and
government spending become more substitutable. The scal authority thus becomes more
willing to allow most spending to be allocated to private consumption, which reduces the tax
distortion. As a result, the ypaper e¤ect is positively related to the tax rate (panel F).
In contrast to our benchmark model (section 2), this alternative model yields two key
implications that we can take to the data. First, if the source of variation is the degree of
substitutability between government and private spending, the size of the ypaper e¤ect and
the tax rates will be positively related. Second, the ypaper e¤ect is larger when the degree
of substitutability between private and government spending is lower.

Fiscal federalism in Argentina and Brazil

In order to test the two key implications of our theoretical model, we use data corresponding
to Argentinean provinces and Brazilian states for the period 1963-2006 and 1985-2005, respectively. There are several detailed studies of the scal federalism arrangements in Argentina
and Brazil.15 Hence, we just provide a brief account and instead focus on characterizing two
key features that are useful for our purposes; namely, the unconditional and exogenous (to
public spending) nature of federal transfers to provinces/states.
Argentina and Brazil are both federal republics. Argentina is a federation of 23 provinces
and an autonomous city, Buenos Aires. Brazil comprises 26 states and a federal district. The
size of the government, measured by the ratio of government expenditure to GDP, averages
35 percent for Argentina and 45 percent for Brazil. Both countries have highly decentralized
government spending. On average, Argentinean provinces and Brazilian states are responsible
for about 40 percent of overall scal spending. On the other hand, tax collection is highly
centralized at the federal level. This implies a particularly high vertical imbalance measured
as the ratio of intergovernmental scal transfers to subnational expenditure, which averages
40 percent (column 1, Tables 1 and 2).
The cornerstone of Argentinas and Brazils intergovernmental scal transfer system is a

tax-sharing arrangement whereby the federal government transfers to provinces/states some
share of federal tax revenues. Indeed, this source of transfers represents (as a percentage of
total federal transfers) about 70 percent for Argentinean provinces and more than 60 percent
for Brazilian states.
While Argentina and Brazil di¤er in the speci cs regarding the mechanisms of the intergovernmental scal transfers, both tax-sharing systems exhibit two key features that prove
to be particularly useful for our study. First, they are mandated either by the constitution
(Brazil) or by law (in Argentina), as opposed to being discretionary. In essence, these laws
regulate how shared tax collection (which includes most domestic taxes, such as VAT and
income taxes) is distributed between the central government and provinces/states (which is
referred to as primary distribution) and how provincial/state funds are distributed among
provinces/states (which is referred to as secondary distribution). These transfers are unconditional in the sense that, by constitution/law, provinces/states are entitled to them based
on their mere existence. This is in sharp contrast to the American federal scal system which
mainly relies on the federal government sharing with states the cost of some selected programs
such as Medicaid, Food Stamp Program, State Childrens Health Insurance Program expenditures, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Contingency Funds, the Federal share of
Child Support Enforcement collections, and Child Care Mandatory and Matching Funds of
the Child Care and Development Fund.16 By design, then, American federal transfers are
conditional and endogenous to current state spending on those particular programs.
Second, Argentinean and Brazilian tax-sharing systems are characterized by institutional
rigidity. The primary and secondary distributions rarely change. For example, the secondary
distribution shares for Argentinean provincial governments have changed only four times since
1963 and changes have been minor (Table 3).17 Indeed, the variability of within-province
secondary distribution shares represents less than one percent of overall variability. Given the
intrinsic unconditional and rigid nature of the Argentinean and Brazilian tax-sharing systems,
scal transfers are, in essence, unconditional and exogenous (to public spending); a critical
property assumed in our theoretical models of Sections 2 and 3.
16
Medicaid alone represented around 45 percent of total federal transfers to states and local governments in
2008.
17
Provinces/states historical secondary distribution shares reect both contributions to the federal co¤ers
as well as redistributive considerations.

14

In addition to collecting subnational output, total spending, and tax-sharing based scal
transfers data, we also gathered government spending by main categories including police, re,
water, sewer and sanitation systems, housing and urban renewal, parks and recreation, health
and hospitals, education, science and technology, public welfare and spending on economic services (Tables 1 and 2).18 Moreover, we also constructed a novel dataset from primary sources
which includes general gross receipt tax rates for the period 1963-2006 for 13 provinces.19
A gross receipts tax, sometimes referred to as a gross excise tax, is a tax on the total gross
revenues of a company, regardless of their source. It is similar to a sales tax, but it is levied
on the seller of goods or services rather than on the consumer. General gross receipt tax
revenues represents about half of provinces own tax collection and is followed in importance
by the legal documentation tax with less than 20 percent in terms of total tax collection.
Moreover, unlike other provincial/state taxes that have several tax rates and fees, the general
gross receipt tax rate has a single rate that makes it easier to assess the stance on taxation
policy. This tax rate dataset is quite balanced covering more than 90 percent of potential
observations.

reported in Column 2 relax the assumption of homoscedasticity and independence within
groups by calculating robust variances and allowing the presence of error autocorrelation
within subnational units. It should come as no surprise that these modi cations increase the
standard errors, reducing the t-statistics. The statistical signi cance of the ypaper e¤ect,
however, remains strong.
Like other papers in the literature, columns 3, 4 and 5 include, respectively, several geographic, demographic and political economy control variables including terrain roughness,
share of water bodies, population density, and pre-electoral periods.20

The results for Ar-

gentina consistently show that provinces with higher terrain roughness and share of water
bodies have higher government spending per capita. Arguably, these features increase the
cost of providing public goods. Pre-electoral periods are associated with higher government
spending in Argentina and Brazil. Since there might exist other unobservable factors that
a¤ect government spending, column 6 also controls for subnational units xed e¤ect. Even
after controlling for all these factors, the ypaper e¤ect remains as a strong empirical regularity in the two countries. With all these controls in place, the size of the ypaper e¤ect
is 1.276 and 1.017 for Argentinean provinces and Brazilian states, respectively.

That is to

say, for the case of Argentina, an extra $1 in personal income increases public spending by
$0.088, while an equivalent increase in intergovernmental transfers triggers a rise in spending
of $1.364. For the case of Brazil, an extra $1 in personal income increases public spending by
$0.002, while an equivalent increase in intergovernmental transfers triggers a rise in spending
of $1.018. Moreover, for both countries we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the ypaper
e¤ect is equal to 1.21

Flypaper e¤ect and tax rates

A key theoretical implication of the model developed in Section 3 is that the ypaper e¤ect
is positively related to tax rates. In Table 6, we estimate panel xed e¤ect regressions like
the ones estimated in column 6 of Tables 4 and 5 but breaking down the Argentinean sample
according to whether tax rates are above or below the median. The ypaper is present in

both samples. However, while the marginal propensity to spend out of transfers is about 17
times as large as the one out of income when tax rates are high (i.e., above the median), it is
only about 9 times as high when tax rates are low (i.e., below the median). Such di¤erence
is statistically signi cant at the 1 percent level.22

7

Flypaper e¤ect and degree of substitutability between private and government spending

Another key theoretical implication of the model developed in Section 3 is that the ypaper
e¤ect falls with the degree of substitutability between government and private spending.
We test this implication by analyzing whether the ypaper e¤ect is stronger (weaker) in
government spending categories which are hardly (easily) substitutable for private spending.
Government spending is hardly (easily) substitutable for private spending when such goods
are public (private) goods (Bergstrom and Goodman, 1973; Reiter and Weichenrieder, 1999).
A pure public good is conventionally characterized by being non-rivalrous (i.e., the marginal cost of an additional person consuming it is zero) and non-excludable (i.e., the cost of
excluding an individual from its bene ts is prohibitively costly). Archetypal examples include national defense and lighthouses. Because of these properties, consumers should not
be excluded from the goods consumption. Since private markets are expected to exclude
consumers by charging a positive price to cover intramarginal costs, some kind of government
intervention  often via public provision  is needed to avoid market failure and provide these
goods at the socially optimal level.
While conceptually attractive, pure public goods are rare since most goods realistically
present congestion e¤ects. Since seminal work by Borcherding and Deacon (1972) and Bergstrom
and Goodman (1973), many studies have estimated the degree of publicness of public goods
by measuring the strength of congestion or crowding out characteristics of these goods. These
studies assume that the usefulness of a public good to a given individual, Z  , is determined
by the function Z  = N  Z, where N is the population size, Z is the quantity of the public
good and

is the congestion parameter. If Z were a pure public good, then

= 0. Progres-

22
We can reject the null hypothesis that the size of the relative ypaper e¤ect from the high tax rate sample
(17 times) is the same as the one of the low tax rate sample (9 times) (p-value 0.0013).

congestion equivalent to a private good. Following Bergstrom and Goodman (1973) most
studies estimate the following equation:

h xit

+ "it ;

(20)

h

where Gj , Y , and N represent the level of government spending in category j, output, and
population, respectively. The variable tax share aims at capturing the perceived price of the
public spending. Strategies to measure this variable vary according to available information.
For example, Bergstrom and Goodman (1973) measure the share of tax on real property
which is paid by a citizen with the median income for his/her community, while McMillan
et al (1981) proxy the tax share of the average household by dividing residential and farm
taxes per household by total municipal tax revenue. The variables xh represent h additional
socio-economic control variables. Following Bergstrom and Goodman (1973), the congestion
or crowding out parameter

is then determined as23
=

!2
;
1 + !3

(21)

where ! 2 and ! 3 are the estimated elasticities of expenditures in category j with respect to
population and tax share, respectively. If the null hypothesis that

= 0 cannot be rejected,

the category of spending can be rationalized as a pure public good with no congestion or
crowding out e¤ects. In other words, if a government spending category Gj were a pure public
good, then larger populations would not increase such spending (i.e., ! 2 = 0). In contrast,
if the null hypothesis that

> 1 cannot be rejected, the good is private because the citizen

receives at most his/her aliquot share. If 1 >

> 0, we are in the presence of a public

23
This footnote follows Bergstrom and Goodman (1973) in order to derive the congestion or crowding out
parameter . De ning Xi as the quantity of private goods, an individual maximizes her utility function
ui (Xi ; Z  ) subject to the intertemporal constraint Xi + tax sharei Z = Yi which is equivalent to Xi + tax
sharei Z  N = Yi . Therefore, the determination of her demand function for Z  is formally equivalent to nding an ordinary demand function where the price is tax sharei N . Assuming that there are constant income
and price elasticities ! 3 and ! 1 for the good Z  , then the demand function for Z  is ! 0 [taxsharei N ]!3 Yi!1 .
The quantity of Z demanded is N times the quantity of Z  demanded. Hence, her demand for Z is
(1+! 3 ) ! 1
3
N ! 0 [taxsharei N ]!3 Yi!1 = ! 0 taxshare!
Yi . Thus the coe¢cient, ! 2 , for the elasticity of dei N
mand with respect to the population could be interpreted to be (1 + ! 3 ). That is to say, ! 2 = (1 + ! 3 ) and,
consequently, the congestion or crowding out parameter can be estimated as follows = ! 2 = (1 + ! 3 ).

good with important congestion or crowding out e¤ects. Following Reiter and Weichenrieder
(1999) such good can be de ned as impure public.
The empirical ndings regarding the degree of congestion captured in

vary depending on

several factors including, among others, the spending category, the level of government used
(city, municipality, county, state) and the year analyzed, as most studies use cross-sectional
data to calculate these estimates.24 Typically, these studies lay out two key ndings. First,
not all publicly provided goods are pure public goods, since the degree of congestion varies
widely. In some cases they nd moderate levels of congestion, which suggests impure public
goods. On other occasions, however, severe congestion e¤ects exist, which implies a strong
degree of privateness. This striking nding  that many of the goods and services publicly
provided do not have the usual publicness properties of collective goods  generated strong
reactions. For example, Bergstrom and Goodman (1973) in their original study ask: Why,
if there are not increasing returns in the municipal provision of the goods and services we
study, is their provision in the public domain? A second frequent nding is that, in many
categories, standard errors of

are large enough to imply that neither

= 0 nor

= 1 can

be rejected. Some papers rationalize this as evidence that those goods show important degree
of congestion since it cannot be rejected that

= 1. However, the fact that

= 0 cannot be

rejected either actually reveals that not much can be said about these goods. For this reason,
we will classify them as undetermined.
Our strategy consists of two steps. First, following the standard methodology captured in
equation (20) above, we empirically determine the degree of publicness of several important
spending categories including re, police, education, housing and urban renewal, health and
hospitals, parks and recreation, public welfare, economic services, science and technology and
water, sewer and sanitation systems.25 The categories used represent about 60 percent and 50
percent of total spending in Argentinean provinces and Brazilian states, respectively. After
classifying these spending categories into (i) pure public, (ii) impure public, (iii) private or
(iv) undetermined, we test whether there is a positive relationship between the degree of
publicness  which we take as a proxy for the degree of substitutability between private and
24
Most papers analyze American subnational units; only McMillan et al (1981) study Ontarios municipalities
for 1976. To the best of our knowledge, no equivalent studies exist for Argentinean provinces or Brazilian states.

We do not include spending categories when data are considerably incomplete or when services o¤ered are
not nal products (such as general and nancial administration).

public goods  and the size of the ypaper e¤ect. In other words, we test whether the size of
the ypaper is larger for pure public good categories than for impure public or private goods.

7.1

Publicness of public spending

In order to classify a spending category, we estimate regression (20) and use equation (21) to
test whether the good or service provided is pure public ( = 0 and
( > 0 and

< 1), private ( > 0 and

> 1) or undetermined ( = 0 and

< 1), impure public
= 1). We estimate

these regressions using panel xed e¤ects and allowing errors to have heterocedasticity as well
as autocorrelation. Allowing for a xed e¤ect per subnational unit is very important in this
particular context in order to control for the very well known zoo e¤ect introduced by
Oates (1988). Oates argues that high levels of congestion, like the ones frequently found in
the literature, may not reect congestion or crowding out e¤ects but rather the fact that some
type of goods and services are provided only when population reaches certain high levels (e.g.,
expenditure on a zoo). By including xed e¤ects per subnational unit, we reduce such bias
as the population elasticity coe¢cient is estimated exploiting only the population variation
within each subnational unit. Including xed e¤ects also partially controls for preferences for
public spending, as long as they remain constant over time. In this sense, xed e¤ects act as
an imperfect substitute for socio-economic control variables typically included in regression
(20). As discussed in great detail in Bergstrom and Goodman (1973) measuring the tax share
variable presents some conceptual and practical di¢culties. We measure tax share of the
average individual dividing the most important tax collection category revenue per individual
by total subnational unit tax revenue. The most important tax collection category is gross
receipt tax for Argentinean provinces and state value-added tax for Brazilian states.
Tables 7 and 8 show our ndings for Argentinean provinces and Brazilian states, respectively, including population density as control variable. Table 7 shows that total public spending in Argentinean provinces is an impure public good with a congestion parameter of 0.499.
Police as well as housing and urban renewal are pure public goods, while public welfare and
education are private goods. The degree of publicness of water and sewer systems, science
and technology, and economic services cannot be determined. Table 8 does not show precise
results regarding the degree of congestion of total expenditure for Brazilian states. Economic

20

services are found to be a pure public good, while police, public welfare, and education are
private goods. Housing and urban renewal as well as spending in health and hospitals show
big standard errors which does not allow us to classify them as either public or private goods.
It is not surprising that both public welfare as well as education are found to be private goods.
As discussed by Stiglitz (1974) in the context of education there seems to be little question
that the marginal cost of educating an additional individual is substantial (probably close to
the average cost, at least for large school systems).

7.2

Size of ypaper e¤ect as a function of the substitutability between
public and private spending

As discussed in section 7, high (low) levels of publicness are expected to be associated with
low (high) levels of substitutability between public and private spending. In other words, in
the case of pure public goods, private spending can be hardly rationalized as a substitute for
government spending. On the contrary, in the case of private goods, private spending could
act as a substitute for government spending. Considering the theoretical model described in
Section 3, we should expect to nd that the size of the ypaper e¤ect is bigger for spending
categories that involve pure public goods than for those associated with private goods.
Tables 9 and 10 show the results for panel xed e¤ect regressions like the ones estimated in
tables 4 and 5, column 6 for di¤erent categories of government spending. The results obtained
are fully consistent with the theoretical implications. In particular, pure and impure public
good categories imply the existence of a ypaper e¤ect at the 1 percent level. In contrast,
public spending categories associated with private goods do not show the ypaper e¤ect; in all
cases we cannot reject that the marginal propensity to spend out of own subnational income
equals the one from scal transfers. Since each spending category represents only a proportion
of total spending, we should expect that the absolute size of the ypaper e¤ect, de ned as the
di¤erence between

f

and

y,

is bigger for total expenditure than for individual categories. For

this reason, we de ne the concept of relative size of ypaper e¤ect as the percentage di¤erence
between

f

and

y.

This measure provides for more accurate comparisons between spending

categories that represent di¤erent proportions of total spending (tables 1 and 2). For example,
for Argentinean provinces, the marginal propensity to spend out of scal transfers is about 9

21

times as high as the one from own subnational income (Table 9). However, such relative size
of the ypaper e¤ect increases to about 23 and 147 times for police and housing and urban
renewal, both pure public goods that are hardly substitutable for private spending. On the
other hand, the ypaper e¤ect vanishes for private goods that are more easily substitutable
for private spending such as public welfare and education. Table 10 shows similar results for
Brazilian states. While the marginal propensity to spend out of scal transfers is about 43
times as large as the one from own subnational income for economic services (pure public
good), these di¤erences vanish for police, public welfare and education (private goods).
In conclusion, there is robust evidence across these two major federations that the magnitude of the ypaper e¤ect is consistently large for government spending categories that
are hardly substitutable for private spending and vanishes when those goods are more easily
substitutable for private spending.

Conclusions

This paper has shown that the ypaper e¤ect is essentially consistent with a simple model of
optimal taxation, in which raising own local revenues is socially costly because of the need
to resort to distortionary taxation (Hamilton, 1986; Aragón, 2009; Dalhby, 2011). In this
context, it is more e¢cient, from the point of view of the local scal authority, to spend more
out of intergovernmental transfers (which is distortion-free money) than from private income
(which can only be spent after securing it through distortionary taxation).
More fundamentally, our model generates two key empirical implications. First, there
should be a positive association between the size of the ypaper e¤ect and the level of the
tax rate. Second, the lower (higher) the elasticity of substitution between private and public
spending, the higher (lower) the ypaper e¤ect. We test these two implications using data
for Argentinean provinces and Brazilian states.
The two predictions of the model are borne out by the data. The size of the ypaper e¤ect
is high when tax rates are relatively high and signi cantly weakens as tax rates fall. We also
nd that the ypaper e¤ect decreases with the degree of substitutability between private and
public spending by using di¤erent government spending categories associated with di¤erent
degree of publicness. For Argentina, for instance, we nd that the marginal propensity to
22

spend out of scal transfers in spending categories such as police and housing/urban renewal
 which are identi ed as pure public goods  is much larger than the propensity to spend out
of private income. In contrast, such di¤erence in propensities to spend vanishes for spending
categories such as education and public welfare, which are identi ed as private goods.

Appendix of data
Geographic and demographic data

Terrain roughness equals (surface area/planar area)*100
100. The original dataset used
to compute both planar and surface areas was provided by the Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI). It consists of the Global Digital Elevation Model acquired from the
NASA/NGA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The resolution is 3 arc seconds (or
approximately 90 meters). The planar area (area as seen from above the earth surface) was
computed from the aforementioned SRTM dataset. A true surface area (i.e., one where the
surfaces along the slopes are accounted for) was calculated from the SRTM dataset by rst
computing the slope for each pixel, then multiplying the secant (reciprocal of the cosine) of
the slope and multiplying this value by the planar area.

25

Water bodies represent the percentage of surface area covered with water bodies. The
data are also from the Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI).
Population density is calculated as population/planar area.

Naturally, we do not need to impose the condition cT = cN T because the Ramsey solution

(54)
(55)
(56)

where P A is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the PAs budget constraint (2).
We formulate the Ramsey planners problem in very general terms. Speci cally, the Ramsey planner chooses g, cT and cN T to maximize the PAs utility, given by (18), subject to the
implementability conditions derived from the PAs maximization problem (equations (54)(56)) and the FAs constraint (5). Therefore, the Lagrangean for the Ramsey problem can be
formulated as
L = U +  1 r 1 +  2 r 2 +  3 r3 +  4 r 4 ;
where r4  f + cT

g. The rst order conditions are given by the following 9 equations:

@L
= 0;
x = cT , cN T , g, , P A , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 .
@x
We solved this system of nine non-linear equations using Mathematica.

Notes: ¨gf and ¨gy stand for change in government spending as a result of a dollar increase in fiscal transfers and citizen's income, respectively. ¨TDf and ¨TDy stand for
change in tax distortion (TD) as a result of a dollar increase in fiscal transfers and citizen's income, respectively. ı is the elasticity of substitution between government and
private spending. ș is the consumption tax rate. cnt is consumption not subject to taxation in a distortionary taxation model and cnt* represents consumption not subject to
taxation in a non-distortionary taxation model.
