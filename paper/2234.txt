The Social Security Cost of Smoking

ABSTRACT

Our paper is an examination of the Social Security cost of smoking from an

individual point of view. It is well known

that

smokers have a shorter life

expectancy than nonsmokers. This means that by smoking they are giving up
potential Social Security benefits. We estimate this cost and consider the
effects on the system as a whole.

We use mortality ratios, which relate the annual death probabilities of
smokers and nonsmokers, and the percentage of smokers in each age group to
break down the life tables for men and women born in 1920 into the approximate

life tables for smokers and nonsmokers. We then calculate expected Social
Security taxes and benefits for each group, using median earnings as a base.
We find that smoking costs men about $20,000 and women about $10,000 in
expected net benefits.

The implication of this for the system as a whole is that the prevalence
of smoking has a direct effect on the financial viability of the system; every
decrease in the number of smokers in society increases the system's liability.
Changes in smoking behavior should be recognized as affecting the system.

1. INTRODUCTION
Smoking in the United States is associated with enormous costs to society.

The Congressional Office of Technology Assessment has estimated the annual cost
of medical care for smoking related illness at $15 to $30 billion, and that
smoking related illness is responsible for an additional $49 to $70 billion in

lost productivity. There are also substantial costs to the individual who
smokes in terms of lost wages over a life time, primarily affecting those who

die of smoking related disease while still active wage earners in the work

force. Costs to the individual also include approximately $500 to $1,000 per
annum for pack and two pack-a-day smokers to purchase cigarettes. An
additional cost to the individual is the loss of Social Security benefits as a

result of smoking-induced loss of life expectancy. The data presented herein
estimate the magnitude of this loss for single and married men and women born
in 1920 and 1923, respectively.

While most of the previous literature on the costs of smoking and the
benefits of quitting has overlooked the implications of smoking behavior on
pension plans (see, for example, Oster, Colditz, and Kelly (1984)), this is by

no means universal. Con et al. (1983) estimated that the savings realized by
Ford Motor Company if the health of their employees improved (in terms of less

expensive medical insurance, disability insurance, and life insurance) would be
much smaller than the additional pension costs due to their increased

longevity. Atkinson and Townsend (1971) noted that the financial benefits the
British National Health Service would enjoy if there was a forty percent
reduction in smoking in Britain would be more than offset by the increased cost
of retirement pensions.

In this paper, we examine the Social Security consequences of smoking from

the individual or household perspective. From that vantage point, Social
Security can be thought of as a prepaid life annuity. Contributions or taxes

1

are collected during one's work life which entitle one to an indexed life
annuity beginning at age 65. The annuity can be conunenced at age 62 with a
roughly fair actuarial adjustment, and can be started at an age beyond 65 with
somewhat higher benefits reflecting the shorter expected remaining lifetime.

In general, the system is not actuarially fair (favoring some cohorts relative
to others, those with low incomes or short covered careers relative to others,
and marrieds, especially one earner couples, relative to singles).

Our point is that the system is unfair in a way very relevant to the

decision of whether or not to smoke. Social Security does not have separate
benefit structures for smokers and nonsmokers even though smokers have a much
lower chance of reaching retirement age and a shorter expected length of

retirement conditional on reaching that age. The Office of Technology
Assessment (1985) estimated that 273,000 people died in the United States in

1982 of smoking related disease. Of those, 44 percent, or 121,000 died before
they reached their 65th birthday. They may have never collected anything from
Social Security. If they were married, their spouse may collect widow's
benefits, but it is clear that their premature deaths greatly reduce their
return on their participation in Social Security.
Smoking also affects the Medicare portion of the Social Security system.

While we concentrate on OASI, it is probably worth noting that the health

insurance component is similarly affected. Many estimates of the effect of
smoking on the total demand for health care services in the country find that

it is small in the long run. Smokers certainly experience more health problems
per year of life, but this is offset by the fact that they live fewer years.

With a lower incidence of smoking, there would be more elderly who require

additional health care services. The reduced demand caused by the improved
health status of the former smokers is offset by extra care needed by the

2

8dditional elderly. There might be some initial reduction in the demand for

health care if smoking was reduced. The improvements in health status would
presumably occur before the age structure was significantly altered. However,
in the long run the two effects offset each other.

Despite the fact that total health care demand may be little affected by
smoking, Medicare's finances are almost certainly affected. The reason is that

it is a prepaid health insurance annuity for those over 65. Medicare does not
bear the higher health costs of nonelderly smokers, but benefits financially

from the fewer numbers of elderly due to smoking. The other side of the coin
is that smokers, as with their retirement benefits, pay while they work for old
age health insurance which they are less likely to collect, or to collect for a

shorter period than nonsmokers. Wright (1986) estimates that each person who
quits smoking increases the deficit faced by the HI component of Social
Security for just these reasons.

Our study is the OASI analog of Wright's HI research. We assemble
separate life tables for smokers and nonsmokers and then estimate the Social
Security taxes, benefits, and transfers for members of the 1920 birth cohort.

We do this for those who earn median wages for their age and cohort and for

those who earn 60 percent of the median, in each case beginning at age 20. The
results can be previewed by saying that we find the expected loss in net Social
Security benefits accompanying smoking to be very large relative to the other

costs of smoking. The loss exceeds the lifetime costs of cigarettes, is large
relative to the estimates of the medical costs and lost wages due to excess
morbidity and mortality, and is perhaps ten times greater than the
corresponding Medicare figures of Wright.

The next section of the paper briefly reviews what is known about the

effect of smoking on mortality. It discusses disease specific effects and also
our technique of using mortality ratios to yield approximate separate life

3

tables for smokers and nonsmokers. The third section of the paper describes
our simulation procedure for calculating the Social Security costs of smoking.
It presents separate results for single individuals, one-earner and two-earner

couples because of their separate treatment by Social Security. We conclude
the paper with an interpretation of what our findings imply about the private
and social incentives to quit smoking.

2. EFFECT OF SMOKING ON MORTALITY
There can be no statistical doubt that smoking is associated with

increased mortality hazard rates. The overall finding of the 1979 Surgeon
General's report on the subject was that the mortality of all male cigarette

smokers is about 170 percent of that of male nonsmokers. For two-pack-a-day
smokers, the average mortality ratio is 200 percent. For particular diseases

the relative hazard is even greater. For example, two separate studies find
smokers are between 9 and 15 times more likely than nonsmokers to die of lung

cancer (Lubin et al. (1984) and Cowell and Hirst (1980)). The risk of dying of
arterosclerotic and degenerative heart disease and myocardial insufficienc-ies

has been estimated at 2.7 times as great for smokers as nonsmokers (Cowell and

Hirst (1980)). There is further evidence that there is a significant
interaccion between smoking and other environmental factors such as exposure to

asbestos. The finding is that while smoking is a major cause of lung cancer,
smoking combined with other assaults (such as industrial exposure) greatly
increases the mortality hazards (Schneiderman and Levin (1974).

Our development of separate life tables for smokers and nonsmokers
utilizes the findings of E.C. Hammond (1966) regarding the effect of smoking on

mortality. Working for the American Cancer Society, he conducted a comprehensive
four-year study tracking a population of over one million subjects. He
determines the death rates and the prevalence of certain causes of death for

4

smokers and nonsmokers of many different characteristics. The technique was to
examine death certificates for the cause of death and to request information
from the attending doctor whenever cancer was mentioned on the death

certificate. Hammond's results are a very detailed set of mortality ratios1
for different types of smokers and for several different causes of death.

In 1959 and 1960, Hammond enrolled over one million volunteers from

twenty-five different states to provide data on mortality. Subjects were
classified by sex, age, type of tobacco smoked (cigarette, cigar, pipe, or
none), age at which subject began smoking, daily amount of smoking, and degree

of smoke inhalation. Each subject was contacted annually for four years to
track the number and timing of fatalities in each group. Death certificates
were received for over 97% of reported deaths to provide better information as
to causes of death.

Using the accumulated data, Hammond combined subjects with similar
characteristics into five-year and ten-year age cohorts, and divided the number
of deaths in each cohort during the study period by the number of "person-

years" experienced in each cohort. This provided cohort death rates over the
period for groups of similar age and sex, and varying smoking habits. This
allowed Hammond to calculate mortality ratios for different groups. A sample
of his findings is shown in Table 1.

The separate mortality tables that we have produced are contained in the

Appendix to this paper. The basic life tables used are the cohort life tables
for men and women born in 1920, as estimated by the Social Security

Administration. The mortality hazards are shown in column 8 of the appendix

table for men and women. If we let Q(a) represent the one-year death
probability for males as a function of age (similarly QX(a) for females),

Harris (1983). They also show the results for Q(a), Q(a), Q(a), and

life tables.

Our life tables for the 1920 birth cohort show that 85,758 males and 88,787

females out of 100,000 births live to age 20. It is well known that smoking
affects the mortality of women less than men. That is partially due to the
fact that women smokers smoke less, inhale less, and are more likely to smoke

filter cigarettes. Again, out of 100,000 births, 53,051 male smokers (who
began smoking at age 20) survive until age 65, whereas 67,464 male nonsmokers

survive until that traditional retirement age. Conditional on living to age
20, almost 79 percent of nonsmokers make it to 65, whereas slightly less than

62 percent of smokers do so. At age 20, male smokers have a life expectancy
6.4 years shorter than male nonsmokers, and a median age of death 7 years

younger. Conditional on surviving to 65, male smokers have a remaining life
expectancy which is 2.7 years less than their nonsmoking cohort members. The
figures for women show that the life expectancy difference at age 20 is 3.3
years, while the difference at age 65 is 2 years.

Our life tables cannot sort out causality and correlation. It is
certainly true that smokers would not become identical to nonsmokers if they

stopped smoking. Smokers drink more alcohol than nonsmokers, have a higher
incidence of suicide, and, in general, may face higher mortality risks than
nonsmokers for reasons correlated with smoking but not caused by smoking per

Se. We have not been able to separate these effects, although it is our belief
that most of the higher mortality risks faced by smokers are due directly to

the cigarette consumption. However, it should be kept in mind when
interpreting our results that we have attributed all of the mortality
difference to the cigarette consumption.

3. SIMULATION OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY COSTS OF SMOKING.
We examine the Social Security consequences of smoking for 100,000 men

born in 1920 and 100,000 women born in 1923. The three year difference
approximates the average age gap in marriage for this cohort. The 1920 cohort
life tables compiled by Social Security are taken to be applicable to the men

and women in our study. We calculate the Social Security outcomes separately
for single men, single women, and one and two earner couples. We assume that
each person's probability of death is given by the life tables, and therefore

is independent of the status of their spouse. The number of women who become
widowed in each year until the husbands retire is noted, and each "widow

cohort" is then tracked as a separate population. This is necessary, because

9

at retirement widows must choose between a benefit based on their own work

record and one based on that of their spouse. In the case of the one earner
couples, we assume that the husband is employed until retirement or death. If
the husband should die before retirement, the widow is assumed to work until
retirement or death.

We have not been very sophisticated in developing our earnings profiles.
The earnings series used are median earnings for men and women working fulltime year-round, taken from the Census Bureau Current Population Report P-60,

No. 142 (1982). Earnings before 1955 and 1982 are estimated using a related
series from the Department of Labor's Employment, Hours, and Earnings report.

The earnings series are then adjusted to reflect a life-cycle pattern of
lifetime earnings, using Census data on mean incomes for different age groups

from Report P-60, No. 137. Our analysis for low wage earners examines those
who earn 60 percent of the median earnings profiles.
There are several factors which could be added to our earnings series.

First, we do not take into account the effect of the increased morbidity of

smokers on their earnings pattern. This is probably a relatively minor
adjustment, but one which is conceptually desirable. Second, nonworking wives
entering the workforce when widowed are assumed to immediately earn the median

(or 60 percent of the median) amount for their age. This is certainly
optimistic regarding their prospects. Finally, we do not take into account
spells of unemployment, employment in the uncovered sector, or disability.

The surviving members of the cohort are assumed to retire at age 65 and

begin to receive benefits based on the 1985 Social Security law. We assume that
the initial benefit received is fully indexed for inflation for their remaining

life. The women in the simulations retire three years later, simply reflecting
that they are three years younger than the men. Because the median earnings of
men exceed those for women, the Social Security OASI benefit based on a man's

10

carnings history exceeds the benefit based on a woman's work record. As a
result, husbands and widowers will always elect to take their own benefit.
Wives choose between their own benefit and one-half of their husband's, while
widows may elect to receive their own benefit or the benefit which their
husband would receive were he alive and had not worked since the year he

actually died. In other words, a woman whose husband died in 1965 could take
the benefit he would be receiving had he stopped working in 1965 and lived to

receive his benefit, or she could take her own benefit. In the two-earner
cohort, her benefit is based on her earnings from 1940 to her retirement in
1988, while in the one-earner cohort her benefit is based on a shorter work
history, 1965 - 1988, since we assume she only begins work upon her husband's

death. This means that a widow's benefit may depend on when her husband died
(and in the one-earner case must depend on it), necessitating our keeping track
of the "widow cohorts" mentioned above.

Wives over the age of 65 whose husbands are still alive will always
receive one-half of their husband's benefit in the one-earner family, since

they have no earnings history of their own. In the two-earner case, wives will
take their own benefit since their benefit exceeds half their husband's, given

our earnings series. All benefits are calculated in real dollars, so

compar1on of 1985 and 1988 benefits is valid.
The results for singles are shown in Table 3. All figures are stated in
1985 dollars, and the real discount rate used for cash flows occurring at other

times is 3 percent. With those assumptions, the figures in the upper portion
of the table for single men with median wage profiles in this cohort show that
nonsmokers can expect to receive a net transfer from Social Security of $3,436,
while the expected benefits received by smokers fall $17,782 short of the

expected contributions. All of these figures are conditional on having survived
to age 20. The Social Security cost of smoking for single men with median

earnings patterns thus exceeds $21,000. The internal rate of return, which
equates the expected value of payouts and payins, is 1.87 percent real for

smokers and 3.17 percent for nonsmokers. If one only looked at those who
survived until 65, the rates of return would naturally be higher. In that
case, the real internal rate of return for median wage male smokers in this

cohort is 3.18 percent, whereas the rate for nonsmokers is 3.78 percent. The
dollar difference in the net transfer between male smokers and nonsmokers,
conditional on surviving to 65, is still about $14,500.

Table 3 indicates that the Social Security cost of smoking is smaller for

single women than for single men. In general single women get a higher rate of
return from Social Security for two reasons. First, they have longer life
expectancies, and, second, they have lower earnings and the system is

progressive. Conditional on age 20, the difference in the net transfer to
median wage women nonsmokers and smokers is slightly more than $9,000. The
real internal rate of return for smoking women is 3.45 percent, while the

figure is 3.87 percent for nonsmokers. Conditional on reaching age 65, the
dollar difference between smoking and not is about $6500 for median wage single
women.

The lower portion of Table 3 shows the results for single individuals with

earnings 60 percent of the median for their age and cohort. The loss due to
smoking in the expected transfer from Social Security is almost $17,000 for men

and $7,000 for women at this earnings level. We conclude that the Social
Security cost of smoking is not terribly sensitive to earnings levels.

The corresponding results for one and two earner married couples with

median earnings profiles are shown in Table 4. One earner couples receive
larger transfers and a higher rate of return from Social Security because of

the benefits received by the nonworking spouse. The Social Security expected

cost of smoking is similar for couples in either circumstance. The net

expected present value of participation in Social Security is $29,467 lower for
one earner couples who both smoke relative to one earner couples where neither

spouse smokes. If only the man smokes, the loss in the expected transfer from
the system is $19,199, whereas if only the wife smokes the loss is $9,732

relative to a one earner couple in which neither smokes. To put these figures
in perspective, one might note that the median earnings of 64 year old men in

this cohort were $20,315. Thus, the Social Security loss for both smoking
amounts to almost 1.5 years labor income. In fact, the loss in slightly
greater than that given that Social Security benefits are taxed more favorably
than labor income.

The numbers for two earner couples are that their expected net Social
Security transfer Is $30,567 less if both spouses smoke than if neither does.
The real internal rate of return for two earner couples in which both smoke is

2.95 percent, whereas it is 3.68 percent if neither smokes. The cost of the
husband only smoking is $19,950, and the cost of the wife only smoking is

$10,482. For reference, the median annual earnings of women is about $12,500,
so the loss if they both smoke is roughly equivalent to 2.4 years of the wife's
earnings.

Table 5 contains the results for low wage one and two-earner couples. For
(

one earner couples, we find that the cost of both smoking is roughly $22,500.
For two earner couples, the cost of both smoking is $23,500. Once again, the
cost is roughly twice as large for men as it is for women. The dollar costs to
smoking are greater relative to earnings for low wage households than for
median earners.

The gain in Social Security benefits that accrue to the nonsmoker, or to
the smoker who quits, represents an equal and opposite drain on Social Security

funds. This drain is only partially offset by the increase in preretirement

taxes paid by nonsmokers and ex-smokers in comparison with smokers, a

substantially greater number of whom die prematurely. The potential cost to
society, including the government, of a successful anti-smoking program has not

gone unnoticed. In 1971, the British government, in response to a
recommendation by the Royal College of Physicians to mount an anti-smoking
campaign, estimated that such a campaign would save money in the short run.

However, by the year 2000, they forecasted that a 40 percent reduction in
cigarette smoking would result in a net loss to the government of 29 million

pounds due to additional benefits received by surviving ex-smokers. The
Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, in its recent report "SmokingRelated Death and Financial Costs," indicated that, in the event of a reduction
of smoking, "there will be some increase in revenues to the government and the
Social Security and Medicare trust funds because people will be working more

years. The increase in these revenues, however, may not equal the additional
costs borne by these programs for the additional retirees." Limiting her
attention to Medicare's hospital insurance fund, Wright (1986) has estimated
that the individual forty-five year old male who quits smoking will cost the
fund between $204 and $2,745.

We have emphasized the extent to which smoking reduces the expected value

of Social Security payments below that of nonsmokers. We need to remember that
because of the nature of the system, a drop in the number of smokers will
provide a cost; every person who begins to smoke implicitly decreases the

future liability of the system. The prevalence of smoking is an important
factor in determining the financial viability of the system.

The percentage of U.S. adults who smoke has fallen drastically in the last

20 years. In 1965, 52% of men and 35% of women age 20 and older smoked; by
1983 the numbers fell to 35% and 30% respectively (Health United States, 1984).

17

This should result in an increase in the average lifespan; since the majority
of these people are below retirement age, we should expect retirees in the
future to live longer on average than current retirees, who are already living

longer than previous retirees due to the reduced use of cigarettes. A higher
percentage of all workers will live to retirement; those who do will collect

benefits for a longer period. This should be reflected in the demographic
projections upon which Social Security taxes and benefits are based.
The trend toward fewer smokers has been a long one, especially among men.

Unless that trend was adequately projected, we expect Social Security

demographic projections to be too low. While the 1958 and 1966 Actuarial
Studies by the Social Security Administration do a good job of predicting 1980
total population levels, they predict too high a number of young people and too

low a number of retired persons. This implies offsetting errors, perhaps
forecasting a longer "baby boom" than actually occurred and underestimating the
additions to life expectancy, some of which can be attributed to lower smoking

levels. This hurts the system twice; more retirees are currently drawing
benefits than projected, and fewer workers will be paying taxes in the future
than projected.

Our simulations suggest that each median wage male smoker in the 1920
birth cohort roughly "saves" the Social Security system $20,000 and each median

wage female smoker saves $10,000. To get an approximate idea of the aggregate
effect of smoking by members of this cohort on Social Security, we can multiply

these saving figures by the number of smokers born in 1920. The result
indicates that if no one had smoked in this cohort, the net transfer to this

population from Social Security would have been $14.5 billion greater. As this
reflects only the change for those born in one year, one can easily see that
the total impact of smoking on the financial circumstances of Social Security
amounts to hundreds of billions of dollars.

18

While we by no means claim that the reduction in smoking is responsible
for all the gains in life expectancy achieved in recent years, we have
demonstrated the enormous potential impact on the system of reductions in

smoking rates. Changes in the prevalence of smoking should be included in the
system's attempts to model future populations.

4.

CONCLUSION
The body of literature discussing the economic costs of smoking has

largely ignored private and social costs with regard to Social Security. Our
analysis is a first step in estimating these costs, both in terms of net

benefits to smokers and reduced payments by the system. We find that the
expected loss caused by smoking from participation in Social Security is a

large one from the individual's perspective. The loss for a median wage male
smoker is about $20,000, or about 11 months of earnings. The loss for median

wage women is approximately $10,000 or about 10 months of earnings. These
losses are quite significant even compared to the health cost consequences of

smoking. We also found that these losses are not very different for workers
with lower wages.

The aggregate implications of our results are that smokers "save" the

Social Security system hundreds of billions of dollars. Certainly this does

not mean that decreased smoking would not be socially beneficial. In fact, it
is probably one of the most cost effective ways of increasing average

longevity. It does indicate, however, that if people alter their behavior in a
manner which extends life expectancy, then this must be recognized by our

national retirement program. Looked at in this way, it is not surprising that
the large potential for increasing lifespans that reduced smoking offers, has
sizable consequences for Social Security.
