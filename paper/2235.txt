International Competition in Services
ABSTRACT
Production of services now dominates economic activity in
the United States and most other nations. It is thus natural to
find increasing attention on the part of U.S. policymakers to
international competition in service activities. Yielding to
strong pressure from the United States, members of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) agreed in September 1986 to
include services in the new "Uruguay Round" of multilateral trade

negotiations. But there remains widespread

skepticism regarding

the prospects for these negotiations.

This paper surveys the main issues and evidence relating to
U.S. international competition in services. It reviews the forces
that have catapulted services to the top of the agenda for the new

GATT round; the conceptual issues raised by international
competition in services; the growing importance of services in U.S.
production and in international transactions;
the relationship of
services growth to "deindustrialjzatjon" of the U.S. economy;
the nature and motivation of barriers to international competition
in services and their relationship to nontariff distortions of
merchandise trade; and the choices awaiting U.S. officials in
forthcoming bilateral and multilateral negotiations.

Introduction

Production of services now dominates economic activity in
the United States. Whether hailed as the dawn of a new
"information economy" or deplored as the key symptom o American

industrial decline, the trend in employment is itself beyond

dispute. By the 1980s, only one U.S. worker in four was employed
in the sectors of the economy producing tangible outputs --

manufacturing plus mining, construction, and agriculture. But
the increasing role of service-sector employment is by no means

unique to the United States. Similar trends have been

reshaping

the economies of the other industrialized nations and even many
less-developed countries.

Given this dramatic economic transformation at home and
abroad, it may seem natural to find increasing attention on the

part of U.S. policymakers to international competition in service

activities. However, unlike domestic production, trade among
nations is still dominated by exchange of tangible goods.
Moreover, while the role of international service transactions is
already significant and while some sectors show potential for

rapid growth, the service transactions prominent in international
commerce are quite different from the activities typical of the
domestic "service economy."

2

In recent decades, national markets for tangible goods have

become increasingly integrated, nd virtually all U.S. goodsproducing industries have experienced significant growth in both

exports and competing imports. However, the rapid domestic
expansion of service industries reflects the rising importance of
health, education, housing, public administration, and other
largely untraded service categories in final demand. The current

U.S. interest in international service competition is focused on
an entirely different group of industries, especially those
supplying information-based business services.

These industries

are small relative to total domestic service-sector employment.

And, although some part of their domestic output is "traded"

internationally, Le, produced by residents of one nation for
purchase by those of another, U.S. firms serve international
markets primarily via local sales of foreign affiliates rather
than exports..

1.

Services on the Policy Agenda
Long ignored by trade officials as a generic issue,

international competition in services has achieved high
visibility on the global policy agenda just a few years after the
subject was first raised by the United States.

At the November

1982 ministerial meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and

Trade (GATT), the United States Trade Representative called for
inclusion of service transactions in forthcoming multilateral

3

negotiations1 But the developing countries were strongly
opposed, and the Ministers merely

recommended that members with
an interest in service issues undertake their own national
studies, exchange information, and report their results at the
1984 GATT session.2
Under continuing pressure from the United States, GATT
members agreed in September 1986 to include services in the
new
"Uruguay Round" of multilateral trade

negotiatio Yet there

remains widespread skepticism regarding progress on service

issues. Abroad, the early and persistent enthusiasm of the
United States for negotiatjo5 on services has caused u.s.
trading partners to assume, perhaps

incorrectly, that the United

States will emerge as the major beneficiary of any liberalization
achieved in this area.
The developing nations, led by Brazil and India, actively
resisted inclusion of services on the GATT agenda. This
resistance was overcome through a compromise that will keep
services on a separate negotiating track from merchandise
trade,
1

With a few minor exceptions, the rules of the GATT
currently apply only to merchandise trade. Outside the GATT
framework, long-established regimes govern international
competition in some specific service
shipping and air transport. However, activities, such as ocean
cartelization rather than
liberalization has been the dominent theme.
In a few other
cases, such as telecommunications, there
are sector-specific
bodies dealing primarily with regulatory and technical issues and
only incidentally with barriers to trade. Also see Stalson
(1985, 30-36).

Representative (1983). This is

December 1983.

but the developing nations are nonetheless suspicious of the

outcome. While the other industrialized nations did eventually
support the U.S. initiative on services, few trade officials
abroad appear to view the prospects with any degree of-

enthusiasm. And even among the U.S. policymakers who pressed so
vigorously for GATT negotiations on services, opinion remains
divided on the best way to bring conflicting national policies
toward services under the discipline of GATT rules.

Analysts in some U.S. government agencies worry that the

GATT initiative on services may be premature. An extreme example
is a recently issued report of the Office of Technology
Assessment that openly suggests U.S. officials may have erred,

perhaps because their decisions were based on inadequate data.
The report's summary section gives this evaluation of the U.S.
decision to promote negotiations on services (Office of
Technology Assessment 1986, 7):

"Consider, specifically, the decision by the United States

prior to the 1982 GATT Ministerial to place a high priority on
services in the next round -- a decision taken in the midst of a

period of deterioration in the ability of the world trading
system to management the impacts on trade in goods of nontariff

barriers, bilateralism, and the national industrial policies that
have become standard in many parts of the world.

Would a better

grasp of the prospects for U.S. exports of services have led to a

different approach to the new round? Certainly the poor quality
and coverage of the data impair the ability of policymakers to

5

gauge the importance of services trade -- as a whole, on a
sector-by-sector

basis, or bilaterally."

2.

Analysis of Competition in Services
Although there is broad agreement on the poor quality of
services data, progress in clarifying the nation's policy goals
has been hampered also by lack of analytical guidance. Given the
huge theoretical and empirical literature on international
competition in goods, surprisingly little attention has been
devoted until recently to international competition in services.
In most empirical research on international trade, services are

simply ignored or are treated as nontradable goods. Theorists,
in contrast, often imply or state without elaboration that trade
in services is conceptually no different from trade in goods, so
that standard analyses in areas such as comparative advantage and
gains from trade apply equally to international commerce in
services.

Each approach has some economic justification.

For the

classic textbook example of haircuts and for many other types of
services important in domestic production, foreign competition is

indeed a negligible influence. Yet some important services,
including shipping, transportation, and a variety of financial
services, have been actively traded for centuries; for these, the

determinants of trade and the gains from trade are fundamentally
similar to those for merchandise trade.
But given the evident heterogeneity of the activities

6

included in the category, does "services" even constitute a

useful analytic classification, or is it merely a convenient

label for a statistical residual?3 The political and economic
issues raised by international competition among producers of
tangible goods have in practice proved far from simple to
resolve, despite ample theoretical and empirical guidance;

consideration of services introduces additional layers of

complexity. These reflect the intangible nature of the outputs
of many service activities, the locational and temporal
constraints linking service providers to consumers, and the
extensive role of domestic regulation in service activities.

Analysts have only begun to grapple with the implications of

these special features. In terms of both measurement and
interpretation, analysis of service issues is still in its
infancy.

All this raises obvious questions about the new GATT

negotiations. Do policymakers have a sufficient knowledge base
to shape international rules that will promote global efficiency?

And do U.S. trade officials have a sufficient knowledge base to
In U.S. statistics for the domestic economy, "services"
are usually defined to include all sectors except manufacturing,
construction, mining, and agriculture. Balance-of-payments
accounting conventionally divides current-account transactions
into merchandise trade and "invisibles". The "services" added to
merchandise trade to form the broader "goods and services"
balance in the U.S. international accounts are income from
foreign investments, military transactions, travel and
transportation, and "other services." (The remaining category of
"invisible" transaction is unilateral transfers.) The U.S.
Department of Commerce uses the term "business services" to refer
to travel, transportation, and "other services" as recorded in
the U.S. international accounts.

identify and pursue the nations own economic interests in the
area of service competition? If not, what can be gained by
putting U.S. influence and prestige on the line to bring services

into the GATT framework? Is the services item on the GATT agenda
truly a generic issue, or is it fundamentally an attempt to

improve the international position of a small set of U.S.-based

multinational firms in a few industries?
The purpose of this paper is to survey the main issues and
evidence relating to U.S. international competition in services.

The next section reviews the forces that have catapulted the
services issue to the top of the U.S. agenda for forthcoming GATT
negotiations.
Section III addresses the question of what is meant by
services and by trade in services, focusing on key ambiguities of
definition. The discussion emphasizes similarities and

differences within the service sector as conventionally defined
and between "services" and tangible "goods."
Sections IV and V interpret evidence on the growing

importance of services in U.S. production and in international

transactions This evidence indicates the extent to which
internationally traded services are unrepresentative of the

The sixth section evaluates the influence of various types
of national policies on international competition in services and
compares barriers to services competition with nontariff
distortions of merchandise trade.
Section VII analyzes some of the choices facing U.S.

officials and evaluates the advantages of alternative negotiating
approaches in dealing with services issues.

The final section sums up principal conclusions emerging
from the survey and emphasizes the links between international
competition in services and other international issues on the
policy agenda.

9

II. Services in the Policy Spotlight
For more than a generation, the majority of U.S. workers
have been employed in service—producing sectors; for well over a
century, employment in the service—producing sectors has been
growing steadily as a share of the U.S. labor force.5

Thus,

while the U.S. can accurately be described as a "service
economy," this is hardly a recent development.

Why then has the

issue of services, barely mentioned in earlier GATT negotiations,
emerged suddenly as a top U.S. priority for the Uruguay Round?
The burgeoning interest on the part of policymakers and the U.S.
business community reflects several independent developments,
each of which has generated some domestic support for marketopening measures in this area.

The first development is increasing concern in the United
States about the nation's performance in international markets.
Until the end, of the 1960s, the technology gap between the United

States and other industrialized nations appeared to provide a
permanent advantage over foreign competitors, especially in the

high-technology industries. Through massive research and
development (R&D) expenditures, U.S. firms created a steady

stream of new products and processes. These innovations allowed
American manufacturing to remain internationally competitive even

given labor costs far higher than those abroad. But the
technology gap narrowed with a speed that few anticipated.
Through their global investments, American companies played a

10

major role in the process.

In 1972, the United States recorded its first postwar

deficit on merchandise trade. While the 1972 trade deficit of $2
billion seems insignificant relative to those of recent years, it
stimulated questions about the course of the U.S. economy and its
future position in world markets. The accompanying employment

shift toward services, while not a new development, suggested the
possibility that U.S. international comparative advantage was

shifting from goods to services
This impression was strengthened by U.S. balance-of-payments
data that revealed a growing surplus in the "services" component

of the current account. As U.S. merchandise trade performance
deterioriated rapidly in the first half of the 1980s, services

continued to make a significant positive contribution. As
recently as 1982, the U.S. surplus on service transactions was
large enough to reverse a sizable deficit on merchandise trade,
so that the United States still showed a global surplus in the
broader category of "goods and services" trade (see Table 1).
From this, some analysts inferred that increased market access
abroad for U.S. service industries could further enhance their
contribution to overall U.S. current-account performance.6
Ironically, the healthy growth in the U.S. surplus on

Optimism about the outcome of trade negotiations almost
always reflects a belief that the nation's exports will increase
more than its imports. Progress toward liberalization thus
typically rests on the shaky foundation of mercantilistic goals
and inconsistent expectations, rather than an accurate perception
of mutual gains to be achieved through expansion of both exports
and imports along lines of comparative advantage.

11

services was due mainly to increases in net earnings on foreign
investments at a time of unusually high interest rates. Since

then, interest rates worldwide have fallen dramatically.
Moreover, the U.S. net investment position has
reversed, with the
United States emerging as the leading borrower in international

capital markets. Accordingly, the contribution of investment
income to U.S. current account performance is likely to become
negative in the near future.

In contrast, as detailed in Table 2, the types of service
exports most likely to rise as a consequence of improved market

access abroad constitute a very minor portion of the relevant

totals. Thus, even highly favorable conditions can be expected
to have only a modest effect on the aggregate international

position of the United States, although such conditions would
provide substantial benefits to a number of U.S. firms.

While some proponents of GATT negotiations on services have
stressed the expansion of service trade as a potential

replacement for lost market share in manufactured products,
others have emphasized complementarity with merchandise trade.
In a variety of service activities that include distribution,
training, repair, telecommunications, computer software,

construction, and leasing, market access in services enhances

market opportunities in related merchandise transactions. This
See, for example, United States International Trade
Commission (1982). The Office of Technology Assessment regards
prospective direct benefits from expanded service exports as
modest but acknowledges the possibility that exports
of goods may
follow from sales of services such as engineering and

12

linkage implies that barriers to international competition in
services may in effect constitute an important category of
nontariff barrier to international competition in goods,
especially manufactured goods.

An additional stimulus for attention to services arises from
the national debate on "deindustrialiZation" of the American

economy. At a time when u.s. manufacturing employment shows
little promise of growth, expansion of the service industries
represents an alternative means to improve the nation's economic

prospects. Yet the forecast that newly created service jobs will
replace jobs lost in manufacturing is itself controverial.

Optimists focus on a relatively narrow set of knowledgebased service activities, including ones closely linked to high-

technology manufacturing. While some of these sectors have
indeed enjoyed rapid growth in recent years, their size relative
to the broad aggregate of services is quite small, both in the

domestic market and in international transactions. Moreover,
further decline in the size of the U.S. manufacturing sector is
likely to slow or even reverse the growth of associated service

activities as well. And U.S. labor unions, which are
concentrated in manufacturing industries, point ominously to the
low average earnings in many types of service employment and to
the lower average rate of productivity increase in services

construction contracts (OTA 1986, 5).

13

relative to that in the goods-producing sectors.8
Support for including services in future GATT negotiations

has also come from the U.S. public officials charged with forming
and implementing the nation's policies toward trade. To many
policymakers, services represent a promising area for continuing
U.S. efforts to maintain open world markets. Negotiations on
services could extend the discipline of GATT rules to a new and
important category of transactions and might also help to
maintain the forward momentum of the liberalization process at a
time when the prospect of further progress on merchandise trade

issues appears dim. Anticipated trade and employment gains from
increased service exports could help to revitalize flagging

political support at home for maintaining open markets.9
Finally, a major part of the impetus for the recent U.S.
emphasis on service issues has come directly from the industries
and specific firms with an important economic stake in serving

international markets. Large international firms in insurance
and other financial-services activities and in business-support
services such as accounting, law, telecommunications, and data
8

Based on an analysis of recent job creation in the United

States, the Industrial Union Department of the AFL-CIO concluded
that service occupations "experiencing the largest net growth in
the number of jobs demand little skill, are only weakly organized
into unions, and usually offer little pay -- ranging from
building custodians to fast food workers. .. .prospects for upward
mobility out of these lower rung jobs. . . are slight" (AFL-CIO
1984, 11-12). However, other researchers view growing servicesector employment in a much more favorable light. For example,
see Lawrence (1984) and Urquhart (1984).
Feketekuty and Krause (1986, 89).

14

processing have actively promoted U.S. initiatives in the area of

services. In many cases, U.S firms expect their best customers
abroad to be the foreign affiliates of major domestic clients.
Thus, the global expansion of competition in services is in part
a reflection of the earlier globalization of U.S. manufacturing
industries.

In pressing their case for increased access to foreign
markets, the interested firms and industry associations usually
make no distinction between services exported from the United

States and those provided locally to customers abroad by foreign

affiliates of U.S. companies. Yet the two modes of serving
foreign markets need to be separated for purposes of policy

formation. Both types of transactions can provide substantial
benefits to the U.S. economy. They will, however, generate quite
different effects on domestic employment and income distribution.

Moreover, improved access for international sales via
foreign subsidiaries is fundamentally not a trade issue at all,

but, rather, a matter of national policy abroad toward direct

foreign investments by U.S. firms. While consideration of trade
in services already represents a significant extension of the

GATT mandate beyond its current domain, the inclusion of service
activities of foreign affiliates of U.S. firms would entail still

a further expansion of GATT jurisdiction.10 This initiative

10 However, trade-related investment policies have also
been ranked high on the agenda for the new GATT round by U.S.
trade negotiators, along with a third "new" issue, protection of
intellectual property.

15

comes at a time when the GATT has been less than notably

successful in its traditional work of maintaining open world
markets for merchandise trade.
In sum, while a number of firms

evidently anticipate

substantial benefits from U.S. action on services, the national
stake in the issue, whether in absolute terms or relative to

other issues confronting members of the GATT, is less clear.
Also, at least part of the broader enthusiasm for expanding u.s.
market access in services reflects
a superficial understanding of
the role and importance of services in U.S. domestic production
and in the nation's international transactions. Has liberalizing

international competition in services been ranked too high on the

nations policy agenda? We return to this question at the end of
the paper.

16

III. Analytical Issues

Despite continuing discussion of the nation's metamorphosis
into a "service economy" and, more recently, of the growing
importance of U.S. international competition in services, only

meager attention has been paid to precisely what activities are
entailed or exactly how these activities enter into international

commerce. This section focuses on the fundamental issue of what
is meant by services, emphasizing similarities and differences

within the industries conventionally grouped together as
"services" and between the categories of "services" and tangible
"goods."

1. How Services Differ
To begin with, which are the industries included within the

broad category of services? In terms of domestic employment,
government (federal, state, and local) is by far the largest
among U.S. service industries, obviously one for which

international competition is not a pressing concern. Other major
domestic service-producing sectors include transportation and
public utilities, wholesale and retail trade, health, and

financial and business services.11 It is in the last category
that the U.S. apparently hopes to make major gains via access to
foreign markets. But in terms of international trade, travel and

See Table 3. Construction, considered a service
activity in the international accounts of the United States, is
included in the goods—producing sectors in the tabulation of
domestic employment by industry.

17

transportation currently account for the lions share of total
U.S. receipts from all "service" transactions (excluding income
from direct foreign investment; see Tables 1 and 2).
Although a number of scholars have attempted to identify the
essential features that separate services from other economic
activities, the inherent heterogeneity of the category implies
that there will be important exceptions to any allegedly common

feature. Heterogeneity may be on the rise, with the increasing
importance of services that are "knowledge-based" or "information-

based." These closely related categories include services that
provide access to proprietary information (from mailing lists to
industrial patents and trade secrets) and the services of
individuals with specialized knowledge (from nursing to law). In
practice, the two categories overlap; for example, an increasing
range of services can be provided directly to the customer by
skilled individuals or offered indirectly in the form of
proprietary computer software packages.
Fundamentally, service activities may be distinguished either

by the nature of their products or by the way in which those

products are supplied.12 Most service industries produce outputs
that are intangible and nonstorable, although the rapidly growing
category of information-based services offers important exceptions.
For sectors such as telecommunications and computers, services and

12

For more extensive discussion of the distinguishing
properties of services as economic activities, see Bhagwati (1984),
Deardorff (1985), Gray (1983), Kravis (1983), Sampson and Snape
(1985), and Stern and Hoekman (1986).

18

tangible goods are often provided together as part of a single

transaction. Another characterizing feature of service products is
high value-added relative to gross output. Again, however, there
is a major exception, wholesale and retail trade, if the value of
goods sold is included as an input.

Looking at the production process, services often require

physical proximity of the producer and the consumer, a distinction
that is particularly relevant for international competition in
these sectors, although new communication technologies are changing

the importance of this production constraint. For some knowledgebased services, a salient characteristic is strong economies of

scale in production. Scale economies may reflect large fixed costs
of physical equipment, as in telecommunications; large fixed costs
of research and development, as for patented industrial knowledge;

or large fixed costs of acquiring managerial or technical expertise
which can then be extended inexpensively to additional customers,

as in management consulting. Especially in financial service
activities, scale offers the further cost advantage of internal
risk diversification.

2.

International Competition in Servic

In general, international trade may be regarded as the
indirect exchange of productive inputs embodied in the goods
traded, i.e. , as a substitute for the direct movement of inputs

19

across national boundaries.13 Opportunities for and gains from
international trade in services thus depend on the extent to which

this indirect exchange is feasible. Since services are
distinguished from tangible goods in part by greater constraints on
the physical location of producer and consumer, it is helpful to

classify services with respect to such constraints. There are four

possible cases:4
(1) No required15 movement of providers or demanders. These
have been called "separated" services (Sampson and Snape,
1985) and "disembodied" or "long-distance" services

(Bhagwati, 1985). Such services are fundamentally
similar to tangible goods with respect to opportunities
for trade and gains from trade.

(2) Required movement of providers (demander-located
services). Where physical proximity to the market is
essential, international competition necessarily entails
movement of capital or labor to the production site, as

in construction. However, the production process may
also involve some inputs in another location (e.g.,
13

A large part of the theoretical literature on

international trade deals with the extent to which indirect
exchange of factors via trade can achieve the same efficiency
benefits in production and consumption as free international
movements of the factors
themselves.
14

The following discussion is based on Stern and Hoekman
(1986).

What is technologically required needs to be distinguished
from what is cost-efficient or profitable. This distinction is
elaborated in the examples below.

20

research and development or management). Deardorff
(1985) calls these additional inputs "absent factors."

(3) Required movement of demanders (provider-located

services). The obvious example is tourism, but in
practice health and education are also important

categories. Free "trade" in such services requires
unrestricted international movement of potential
demanders.

(4) Required movement of either providers or demanders. In
this case, production requires proximity, but the
activity is "footloose" and can occur in the importing

nation, the exporting nation, or even in a third
location.

Another relevant classification of services is with respect to

their relationship to merchandise trade. Some internationally
provided services are complementary to trade in tangible goods
(e.g., transportation, insurance, computer software), some offer
alternatives to goods trade (e.g., licensing, computing services),

while a third group are unrelated to goods trade (e.g., health and
education).

Both classification schemes can be useful in sorting out
issues of international competition (and barriers to international

competition) in the broad range of activities usually lumped

together in the category of services. However, any such taxonomy
is necessarily arbitrary, and rapid changes in technology may in
any case shift a particular activity from one niche into another.

21

U.S. firms may offer their services (and also tangible
products) for sale abroad through direct exports or through local
domestic transactions of a foreign affiliate.16

In standard usage,

a U.S. service "export" entails production by U.S. residents of a
service purchased by a resident of another nation.

It is thus the

country of residence of the producer and buyer, rather than the
site of production, that distinguishes trade in services. While
the same definition applies for tangible goods, most trade in goods
is accomplished by the movement of the goods themselves across

national boundaries. But except for separated services (case 1
above), trade in services involves the movement of the producer
and/or the buyer of the service.

As an alternative to exporting, a U.S. firm may establish a
foreign subsidiary or enter into a joint venture with a foreign
firm.

In this case, the affiliate abroad can provide the service.

Most of the affiliates labor requirements will be met locally,
although. some skilled workers or managers may also move for a time

period from the United States to the site of the foreign affiliate.
In both trade and affiliate sales, there is a link to the U.S.
firm, but sales abroad of U.S. affiliates do not necessarily entail

a specific transaction between a U.S. resident and a resident of
another nation and thus may not enter directly into the U.S.
balance-of-payments accounts.

However, exporting and affiliate sales are not mutually

16 Most analyses of international competition in services
exclude factor services, i.e., the employment abroad of a country's
labor or capital by a foreign firm.

22

exclusive modes of participation in foreign markets. In fact, they
are often complementary activities of multinational corporations.17
Likewise, trade and factor movements, or exports of goods and
exports of services, have significant complementarity in actual

transactions. The potential links among alternative modes of
competition in foreign markets are highlighted in the following
comparison, adapted from Feketekuty and Krause (1986), of the
foreign sale of an automobile (tangible good) and of insurance

(service). In both instances, movement abroad of U.S. factors,
establishment of a foreign affiliate, and exporting are all
potentially present.

To sell automobiles abroad, the U.S. producer usually

establishes a dealer network in the foreign market. The U.S. firm
need not own the dealerships, but in practice often does so. The
firm also sends sales representatives to the foreign market to
negotiate the. terms under which the cars will be sold, government

relations representatives to persuade foreign governments that
safety and environmental standards have been met, and engineers to

train and advise local mechanics. The automobiles themselves may
be exported from the United States or produced by a local

subsidiary. Often, market penetration begins with exporting and
may be followed by establishment of a local subsidiary. Even then,
the local operation may simply assemble automobiles from parts
imported from the United States.

The U.S. insurance company wishing to sell policies abroad
17

See Bergsten, Horst, and Moran (1978, Chapter 3).

23

will likewise require a dealer network of local insurance brokers

or agents to sell and service the policies. Again, the U.S.
company need not own the brokerages but may do so. The U.S.
insurance company will likewise need to send government relations
managers to satisfy the foreign government that local regulatory
requirements have been met, sales representatives to deal with
local brokers, and perhaps management consultants to help train the
local brokers.
For both automobiles and insurance, what is "exported"

conceptually to the foreign market represents just a fraction of
the value of the purchase made by the final consumer. Value added

by local inputs, including sales and service personnel and

transportation, make up the difference. In the case of insurance,
what is exported by the U.S. company is mainly risk-bearing and
related industry know-how, as well as other "headquarter services"
of the parent corporation.
Attempting to classify any given transaction as either an
export or an affiliate sale may thus produce a distorted overall

picture of international competition. A more appropriate question
concerns the relative importance of the two modes of foreign

competition. The extent to which a given foreign transaction is
carried out through affiliate sales rather than exporting obviously
depends on technology but is also influenced by a variety of
government policies toward trans-border flows of products and data,
movements of people, and direct foreign investment.

Such policies

at home and abroad may have a minor influence on the global market

24
share of a given firm but a major influence on the firms primary
mode of participation in foreign markets.

3. Comparative Advantage in Services
Comparative advantage is the basic determinant of the
direction of trade and of the gains from trade among nations:

nations export the goods they can produce relatively cheaply and
import goods that are relatively more costly to produce at home.

Trade can thus be viewed as a superior indirect technology for

producing certain goods. A given supply of primary inputs yields a
greater total value of outputs when resources are concentrated in
activities that are relatively more efficient.

Conceptually, comparative advantage may rest on differences in
relative factor abundance, differences in technology, or the

existence of scale economies. Most of the literature on
merchandise trade has focused on the role of relative factor

abundance. When countries have similar tastes and technologies,
each will tend to export goods making relatively intensive use of
its abundant factors and import goods requiring large amounts of
its scarce factors.18

18 The theory of comparative advantage explains the source of
mutual gains to nations from international trade and, in
particular, shows that a nation can gain from trade even if it is
at an absolute disadvantage in all productive activities. The
theory of comparative advantage does not suggest that every
resident of a given nation will be made better off by trade.
Actual trade flows are determined by international competitiveness,
of which comparative advantage is just one element, along with
exchange rates and national policies. Comparative advantage is a
reliable predictor ofa nation's trade flows only when exchange
rates are consistent with globally balanced trade and the influence

25

Accordingly, U.S. comparative advantage should lie in the
high-technology areas, as these employ large amounts of skilled

labor, the nation's abundant resource. Extending the same approach
to services, there is a similar presumption that U.S. comparative
advantage will lie in the high-technology end of the spectrum, and
particularly in the production and export of knowledge itself.
However, recent theoretical research has emphasized the
potential role of economies of scale in determining trade flows and

the gains from trade. With restricted trade, large countries will
tend to have lower prices for goods and services subject to

important economies of scale.'9 But these lower prices do not
necessarily predict the direction of trade when barriers are
removed; with integrated markets, a firm located in a small nation
no longer operates at a cost disadvantage.
Moreover, while scale economies increase the potential
benefits from. liberalization, they also complicate the issue of how

these benefits are shared.

In particular, the possibility that a

given nation may lose by expanding trade even though global
efficiency is improved is more difficult to rule out when scale

economies are important. Mutual gains are assured only if each
country is able, on average, to expand production in industries

of trade-distorting policies is minor.

product. This tendency has been termed "false comparative
advantage" by Lancaster (1980). Also see Helpman and Krugman

with scale economies.20

Information-based and knowledge-based services are the areas

in which U.S. firms and U.S. policymakers seem most confident of

expanding global sales. These services are likely to exhibit
strong economies of scale. The theoretical analysis of comparative
advantage and gains from trade suggests both that the apparent U.S.

advantage in these industries (as measured by domestic prices) may
be overstated under current conditions and that the cautious
approach of other nations toward the liberalization of trade in
services may have a firm economic basis.

20 This problem was discussed by Frank Graham more than half
a century ago. For a modern treatment, see Helpman and Krugman (1985).

IV.

Services in the Domestic cpm
This section reviews evidence on the growing importance of

services in U.S. employment and production, and compares U.S trends

with experience of other nations. Tables 3-8 indicate the division
of U.S. economic activity into service and non-service components

according to two alternative criteria. As discussed below, the
most important categories of internationally traded services (see
Tables 1 and 2) are not the same ones that are most important in
terms of recent growth of domestic employment.

1.

Services in U.S. Employment
Sectoral employment is the yardstick that demonstrates most

clearly the extent to which the United States has become a "post-

industrial" or service economy. Tables 3 and 4 show recent
nonagricultural employment of U.S. workers by type of industry.
The service-producing sectors are distinguished here by the
intangible nature of their output and include both final-demand and
intermediate-input categories.

As Table 3 shows, U.S. employment is now heavily concentrated
in the industries broadly described as service-producing:
transportation, public utilities, wholesale and retail trade,
finance, insurance, real estate, miscellaneous business services,

health, and government. This broad range of activities comprises
all industries that are not included in the goods-producing sector,'

i.e., manufacturing, construction, mining, and agriculture. The
employment classification in Table 3 is on the basis of the

28

industrys main output, which may be sold to final consumers
(health, education), used as an intermediate input (business
services), or both (restaurants).

Tables 4 and 5 indicate the nation's labor-force allocation in

longer-term perspective. Table 5 shows the division of U.S.

employment among three major sectors: agriculture, goods, and
services. Here agriculture includes forestry and fisheries; goods-

producing employment includes mining and construction. Government
employment is allocated according to industry, with only public
administration listed as a separate service category.

Table 5 reveals that the growth of service-sector employment
as a share of the U.S. labor force is a trend going back to 1850,

the earliest year for which data are available. However, until
recent years that growth was accommodated mainly through the

secular contraction of agriculture's share. Agriculture accounted
for about two-thirds of U.S. employment in 1850 but less than four
percent by the 1980s.

In contrast, the share of goods-producing employment increased
steadily until the turn of the century and moved cyclically around

the one-third mark for many years thereafter. Only in the past
twenty years has growth of employment in service-producing
industries come mainly at the expense of manufacturing and the
other non-agricultural goods-producing sectors.

Even so, it is primarily the share of the goods-producing
sectors in total employment, rather than the level of such

employment, that has fallen in recent years. As Table 6 indicates,

29

the number of workers in goods-producing employment actually rose
between 1967 and 1979, even though the share of these sectors fell
from 34.7 percent to 30.2 percent of the U.S. labor force. But a
sharp recession in 1980-1982 produced a substantial fall in goods-

producing employment. Although employment growth resumed in 1983,
by 1986 the total number of workers in the goods-producing
industries was still well below previous peaks. Of course,
employment in manufacturing and other goods-producing sectors fell
even more relative to the levels that would have been attained had
the distribution of the larger labor force among the major sectors
remained unchanged from the 1967 pattern.

2. Services in Gross National Product
A similar pattern emerges from an examination of U.S. gross

national product (GNP) by industry, as shown in Table 7.

In

current dollars, the service-producing sectors now account for over
two-thirds of U.S. GNP, up from about 55 percent immediately after

World War II. The industrial classifications used in Tables 3-7
include both intermediate and final products, and both government
and private activities.

An alternative measure of the economic importance of services
is their share in final demand as measured by consumer spending.

As shown in Table 8, expenditure for services now accounts for
about one-half of total personal consumption expenditures, up from

about 40 percent in 1929 and as little as one-third in 1950. The
main categories of service expenditures in final demand are

30

housing, utilities and other services used in household operation,
transportation, and medical care. 2

However, these data tend to

understate the relative importance of services in final
consumption, since they do not include important governmentfinanced consumption services such as education and recreation.

3. Why and How Services Grew
The summary tables presented above document the evolution of

todays "service economy" but give little insight into the causes

of these dramatic changes. In brief, the employment and output
shifts reflect the combined impact of three basic forces: changes
in the sectoral allocation of final demand (in turn reflecting
rising per-capita income and systematic changes in relative prices
as well as demographic shifts), relative rates of productivity
improvement, and changes in the organization of economic activity.

Looking first at the long-term shift of employment out of
agriculture offers some perspective on the more recent movements

from goods-producing to service-producing employment. In the case
of agriculture, low income and price elasticities of demand,
changing dietary preferences, and sustained high rates of
productivity improvement have all contributed to agriculture's

declining share of total employment, even over the periods when the
United States was increasing its penetration of foreign markets.

Changes in the organization of economic activity reinforced

21 Housing services in Table 8 include the imputed rental
value of owner-occupied housing, but transportation services does
not include a similar imputed value for motor vehicles.

31

the effects of demand and productivity changes, with specialized

processing, transportation, distribution, and business-services
units gradually taking over many functions once handled by workers

classified as agricultural employees. But the nation is by no
means losing its "agricultural base" in terms of production. On
the contrary, agricultural outputs have continued to grow with
dismaying rapidity despite the steady decline in the number of
workers employed in the sector.

While the shift from goods-producing to service-producing
employment is more complex, some of the same forces were important.

Changes in the age composition of the population and in the laborforce participation of women have fueled increases in the demand
for some services that have experienced high rates of growth.
These include health and education among professional services, and
eating and drinking establishments, a major component of retail

trade. Moreover, the goods-producing sectors have maintained
relatively high rates of productivity increase, so that outputs of
most sectors have continued to rise even when employment has

stabilized or dipped. Finally, changes in the degree of vertical
integration of goods-producing firms has led to a reclassification
of many workers from other industrial categories as service
employees although the work performed by these employees is
basically unchanged.

In recent years "business services" has been the most rapidly

growing sector of the U.S. economy in terms of employment. The

32

business services sector comprises seven major industries:22
advertising; consumer credit reporting and collection; mailing,
reproduction, and stenographic services; services to buildings,
including cleaning, maintenance, and exterminating services;

personnel supply services, including both temporary-help suppliers
and employment agencies; computer and data processing services; and
miscellaneous business services, which include research and
development, management and consulting, and protective services.

Firms in this industry provide a variety of business services
on an ongoing contractual basis (e.g., janitorial services, data
processing, advertising) or to accommodate temporary or cyclical

requirements (e.g., office personnel, unskilled labor). While some
of the included activities are new (computer services), the growth
of others reflects, changes in the way U.S. firms are doing business

and particularly in employer-employee relationships in the goodsproducing sectors of the economy.23

4. Services, Labor Supply, and Productivity
Changes in the composition of the labor force may affect

22 This definition is the one used in the employment data
published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "Business services" is
sometimes defined more broadly to include all services purchased
mainly by businesses rather than households, adding in particular
business-oriented financial and communcation services. Also, the
U.S. Department of Commerce uses the term "business services" in
its balance-of-payments reporting to refer to all nonfactor
services traded internationally.
23
Like the broader services category, employment in business
services includes workers at every level of skill. See Howe (1986)
for a detailed assessment of employment growth in the business
services industry.

33

growth of service employment through changes in productivity as
well as through changes in the pattern of final demand.

The recent

bulge of new entrants into the labor force was absorbed in large
part through expansion of employment in the services sector, with
slow or negative increases in compensation. One recent study found
that women hired in the service sector were much more likely not to
have worked at all in the previous year than to have worked

previously in the goods sector.24 The rapidly growing retail-trade
sector (which includes the infamous fast-food outlets) experienced
the largest relative decline in average hourly earnings between
1977 and 1983 of any major employment sector.25

With fewer new entrants to the labor force, or with greater
downward rigidity of wages and employee benefits (as in the

European Community), a smaller number of new jobs would have been
created in services, while the higher cost of employing additional

workers would have induced employers to adopt more capitalintensive (i.e., more "productive") technologies.26

The relatively strong productivity performance and accordingly

24 Urquhart (1984). Men hired in the service sector were
more likely to have worked in the goods-producing sector rather
than not working at all during the previous year.
25 U.S. Department of Labor, Handbook of Labor Statistics,
June 1985, Table 78.

26 A related issue is the extent to which firms in service
industries earn rents, which are shared with workers through higher
wages. Using micro data, Krueger and Summers (1986) show that most
service industries are low-paying even when the usual adjustments
are made for worker characteristics. The exceptions include banking
and insurance, industries that are characterized by substantial
barriers to entry.

34

low employment growth of the goods-producing sectors may have a

similar explanation. With more extensive unionization and less
flexibility in compensation and work rules, faster adaptation of
new labor-saving technologies would typically mean slower
employment growth but higher measured increases in labor

productivity for any given growth rate of output. Thus, for both
tangible goods and for services, sectoral patterns of labor
productivity growth are appropriately viewed as endogenous,
reflecting the interaction of such forces as technological advance,
labor-market developments, and tax policy.

4.

International Comparisons

The relative importance of the U.S. service sector in total
employment has increased over time with the nation's rising per-

capita income. Cross-country evidence also points to a strong
positive correlation between service employment and per-capita GNP.
As Table. 9 shows, in 1981 service employment absorbed just 15

percent of the labor force of the world's poorest countries, while
agriculture occupied nearly three workers of every four -- a
pattern not too different from the United States in the mid1800s.27
27

Final demands are typically met by a combination of goods
and services selected on the basis of both income and relative
prices. Intermediate-input service needs are met by direct
employment or by purchases from specialized service-providers.
Again, the choice depends on relative prices. The observed longterm correlation between per-capita income growth and the
importance of service employment necessarily reflects changes in
relative prices as well as systematic effects of rising income
(Kravis 1983; Kravis, Heston, and Summers 1983). The same is of

35

Among the industrialized nations, the average share of service
employment was 58 percent, with the United States eight percentage

points higher. Moreover, between 1965 and 1980, every
industrialized country showed an increase in the share of services

in total employment. The same was true also for the nonmarket
economies of Eastern Europe and of almost all other nations,

whether rich or poor. In most cases, the increase in the share of
services has come at the expense of agricultural employment,

presumably reflecting the dissemination worldwide of modern
agricultural technologies as well as the industrialization goals of
many nations.28

A similar pattern emerges for the percentage share of services

in gross domestic product (GDP). As Table 10 indicates, the
percentage share of services in GDP averaged 62 percent in 1984 for
the industrialized nations but only 29 percent for the world's

poorest nations. The table also shows that the share of services
has been increasing over time for every industrialized nation,
while that of industry broadly and of manufacturing specifically
has been declining.
These shares are calculated on the basis of local domestic

prices. However, prices of services tend to be higher relative to
those of tangible goods in countries with higher per—capita GNP.
course true for cross-country comparisons in a given year.

28 Some developing nations are belatedly recognizing their
strong comparative advantage in agricultural production as well as
the concentration of poverty in rural areas. A few are attempting
to alter domestic policies that have favored industrial production
at the expense of agriculture.

36

When a common set of international prices is used to value outputs,
the percentage shares of services in GDP differ less markedly over
time for a given country or between rich and poor nations in a

given year. Using real-quantity indices in place of value shares,
Kravis, Heston, and Summers (1983) show that in real terms, lowincome countries may actually consume services in higher

proportions than wealthier nations. This finding presumably
reflects the very low relative prices of services in poor
countries.

37
V.

International Service Transactions

The high priority placed by the United States on
negotiations
on trade in services is frequently justified by assertions that
this trade is currently or potentially very important to the

nations overall international position. Yet the data on U.S.
trade in services provide only weak support for such a claim.
Globally and also for the United States, the aggregate size of
services trade as reflected in balance-of-payments data is roughly

one-fourth that of merchandise trade. Moreover, that proportion
has been relatively stable in recent years. Thus, neither the
absolute size nor the rate of growth of trade transactions in
services by themselves make a compelling case for its recent

promotion to a top position on the trade policy agenda of the
United States.

Although there is ample reason to believe that official trade
data seriously underestimate the true value of both U.S. service

exports and imports, even improved and expanded services data do
not provide credible support for a major push on services trade.
If there is a strong argument for broad-based negotiations on

services, it appears to lie less in trade than in the alternative
mode of international competition, sales abroad of U.S. affiliates.
Tables 1]. and 12 show the value and composition of

international service exports in 1980 for the 25 leading service-

exporting nations. The United States is indeed largest in terms of
services exports, as well as of merchandise exports and income from

foreign investment. However, the relative importance of services,

38

as measured by the ratio of service exports to GDP, is less for the

United States than for most of the other nations. This should
perhaps not be surprising, given the very large absolute size of

the U.S. market. But the ratio of service exports to merchandise
exports is also far below that of other major service exporters.
Still, these data provide only a partial indication of the
importance of international competition in services to the U.S.

economy. As described in Section III, a U.S. firm may compete in
markets abroad through direct exports or through a foreign

affiliate. A service export entails production by U.S. residents
of a service purchased by the resident of another nation. At least
in principle, the total value of service export sales appears in
the services section of the U.S. balance-of-payments accounts.29

As shown in Table 12, the most important service export categories
by value for the United States and most other nations are travel
and transportation.

Unlike export sales, sales abroad of U.S. affiliates do not
enter directly into the U.S. international accounts, as such sales
do not necessarily entail a specific transaction between a U.S.

resident and a resident of another nation. Affiliate sales

In practice, many service exports are misreported or
unreported. Some service exports are bundled together with
merchandise exports (e.g., computer equipment and software). For
these, the total value of the bundle is reported as a merchandise
export. In others including tourism, reported amounts are based on
voluntary surveys with low response rates. Some categories of
service exports are estimated from conceptually flawed or
incomplete data, while still others are simply omitted. For
further details on measurement issues, see Office of Technology
Assessment (1986) and references cited there.
29

39

probably have important indirect effects on two items in the
services section of balance—of-payments accounts, earnings of U.S.

investments abroad and intra—firm payments of royalties and

licensing fees. But neither item provides a reliable measure of
the U.S. stake in the foreign market, as payments between the

parent and foreign affiliates are shaped by tax considerations and
other dimensions of national regulation.

For the firms and industries that have shown the greatest
interest in a U.S. initiative on services trade, sales abroad by
foreign affiliates are substantially larger than exports from U.S.
operations, although the industries' own discussions typically do

not distinguish these two types of foreign operations or divide
revenues from foreign markets into exports and affiliate
transactions.

The importance of subsidiary sales in total foreign sales of

U.S. service firms is qualitatively similar to the situation of
international competition in tangible goods.

In the manufacturing

industries, U.S. firms have maintained a roughly constant share of

world exports in recent decades. But exports from the United
States have constituted a declining share of total U.S. sales in

international markets, with exports from U.S. affiliates abroad
increasing to maintain overall constancy of the total market
share. °

In

the case of services, available data are sketchy for both

exports and foreign sales. One estimate suggests that revenues

°

Kravis

and Lipsey (1985, 1986).

40

from sales abroad of U.S. affiliates exceed those from U.S. exports
on average by about fifty percent (Office of Technology Assessment,

1986). Since profit rates of foreign subsidiaries are usually
higher than those of domestic operations, this would mean that, in
terms of profits to U.S. firms competing internationally, affiliate
sales probably account for well over half of all profits generated

by operations abroad. However, affiliate sales translate into a
smaller demand for domestic labor input than the same dollar volume
of export sales.

The importance of affiliate sales relative to direct exporting
varies substantially across those industries with important

international transactions. For some major service industries,
including travel, educational and legal services, and technology
licensing, direct exports account for nearly all revenues from

international transactions. In a second group, including
insurance, advertising, and accounting, affiliate sales provide the

bulk of foreign revenues. For a third group, including
transportation, construction, consulting, and computer software,

both direct exports and affiliate sales are significant. Table 13
shows Office of Technology Assessment estimates of 1983 revenues in

both categories for U.S. service firms. Banking, an important
service industry both domestically and in international

transactions, was treated separately because of the special problem
of distinguishing investment income from the service component of
foreign revenues.

Given that affiliate sales greatly exceed exports for many

41

service providers, a broader measure of the importance of
international transactions to U.S. service industries is the size
of total foreign revenues from both sources relative to overall

sales. For the major U.S. service industries as ranked on the
basis of domestic employment, including health services and
education, foreign revenues from exporting plus affiliate sales are
small relative to the value of total output. Moreover, as with
merchandise trade, a few large firms account for the lions share
of all U.S. international service transactions in a given industry.
While there is no "typical" service sector, the insurance
industry can provide an illustration of the relative magnitudes.
According to Stalson (1985, 94), there are about 10,000 insurance
companies worldwide, with half of those in the United States alone.
But only a few hundred have significant foreign sales, Of this
group, about 50 are U.S. firms; among the U.S. firms, five are very
large and operate in many countries. Revenues from foreign sales
constitute about one-tenth of total revenues for the U.S. industry,
with most of that going to five firms.
Although the data for many service industries are seriously
deficient, a more significant problem is in interpretation. None
of the available measures can give an accurate indication of the

contribution of foreign sales to profits. For information-based
service industries, including telecommunications and most business
services, fixed costs may account for a very large portion of total

costs. Expansion into foreign markets (whether through exports or
sales of affiliates abroad) may thus make a contribution to profits

42

far in excess of the proportion of foreign sales to total

revenues.31 Of course, the actual or potential contribution to
profits of U.S. firms is still far from a measure of the national
stake in pursuing multilateral liberalization of barriers to

international competition in the service sector. This is
particularly relevant at a time when attaining U.S. goals will

surely require trade concessions affecting the prospects of other
domestic industries.

31

The existence of scale economies is, of course, not unique
to for—profit activities. Both health and education, largely
organized on a not—for-profit basis, offer similar examples of
potential benefits from "exporting" services in excess of the share
in total revenues.

43

Barriers to International_Competition

VI.

The U.S.
round

move to promote inclusion of services in

the new

GATT negotiations reflects the belief not only that
international service transactions are important to the American
of

economy but also that significant barriers hamper the access of

U.S. firms to foreign markets. This section considers the types of
barriers that might be included in efforts to maintain open markets
for services transactions, and prospects for success based on
experience in negotiating limits on barriers to merchandise trade.

1. Barriers to Merchandise Transactions
Even for the relatively straightforward case of tangible
goods, barriers to trade are anything but straightforward.

Tariffs, the classic trade barrier, have not entirely disappeared,
and high tariffs are still present for some products. However, in
recent decades focus has shifted to "non-tariff

barriers" (NTBs)

to trade., meaning all other national policies that potentially

affect the volume of and gains from international trade. The

Kennedy Round of GATT negotiations succeeded in slicing most tariff

rates to postwar lows. The subsequent Tokyo Round was the first to
tackle the much broader issue of nontariff barriers, but with only
modest results.
At least four major reasons account for the slow progress.
First, NTBs are not one problem but fifty or three hundred separate

problems, ranging from relatively straightforward quantitative
trade restrictions to such complex mechanisms as product standards,

44
government procurement procedures, and labor—market policies. In
most cases, the impact on foreign competition is not the primary
motivation of the policy, although in practice such policies are
nonetheless administered in a way that puts foreign firms at a
disadvantage in serving the local market.

A second reason for slow progress in limiting the
proliferation of nontariff barriers is that their use arises partly
from basic deficiencies of the GATT structure in handling problems
of adjustment to changing international •conditions. For example,

the widespread use of "voluntary" export restraints (VERs) reflects
general dissatisfaction with the provisions of Article XIX, which

in principle governs members response to unanticipated changes in
international competition.

Third, the GATT was designed under the assumption that
national policies can be viewed as having both "domestic" and

"international" components. The GATT rules focus primarily on the

latter -

i.e.,

policies applied at the national border. But the

increased integration of national markets has made this dichotomy
almost obsolete.

Finally and perhaps most important, both the GATT negotiation
process and the GATT rules are predicated on a mercantilistic view
of the gains from international trade, i.e., that the "gains" from
open markets are expanded exports and that any increased imports

represent the price paid for the opportunity to expand exports. By
failing to emphasize the real mutual gains from integrated global
markets, GATT member nations have shifted negotiating efforts in

45

inappropriate directions, even to the point of forcing GATT to
become a party to global cartelization of the markets for textiles
and apparel.32

Unfortunately, the factors that apply to merchandise trade are
at least equally relevant for international competition in
services, where movement of "traded" products across national
borders is the exception rather than the rule. This does not
necessarily imply that inclusion of services in forthcoming
negotiations is unprofitable. It does, however, mean that the

very

basic problems now confronting the GATT are likely to be
exacerbated rather than eased by broadening its mandate to include
services.

2.

Barriers

to Competition in Services

Diverse in many respects, the service industries do not share
common objectives with respect to expansion abroad. Indeed, some
industries with well-established foreign operations are hesitant to

participate in a generic sectoral push to expand market access
abroad lest their own firm-specific and industry-specific needs
receive less favorable attention from foreign governments. Even
information on the relative importance of particular types of

barriers is not easily collected. Some U.S. firms are reluctant to
divulge information that might indicate their competitive position
to foreign or domestic rivals, and the service firms as a group are'

32 The small CATT secretariat has remained an important voice
for liberal policies, but these efforts have had scant influence on
the actions of major nations.

46

less accustomed than those in the goods—producing sectors to
providing detailed information about their business operations to
government agencies on a regular basis (International Trade
Commission 1982, 1).

To provide better support for U.S. efforts, the International
Trade Commission conducted a voluntary survey of 479 international

service firms in fourteen service industries. Only about onefourth of the firms responded to the survey, and the response rate

was much lower in some industries. In communication services, only
one firm out of eight responded to the questionnaire.

Respondents identified the degree to which specific nontariff

barriers were encountered in foreign markets. Most important were
restrictions affecting the basic "right of establishment" in the
foreign market (63% of all respondents), specific barriers to
provision of a service by foreign firms (62%), and foreign-

exchange controls (54%). Other barriers in order of frequency
included government procurement (30%), technical issues (27%),
restrictions on related trade in goods (21%), subsidies and
countervailing duties (21%), licensing requirements (18%),
standards and certification (17%), inadequate protection of
intellectual property (12%), and professional qualification
restrictions (10%).

Despite the ubiquitous nature of these barriers, one-fourth of
the firms did not anticipate any increase in foreign revenues from
their removal. Presumably profits would rise, however.

Half of

the firms surveyed did expect revenues to increase, but the

47

anticipated increase was surprisingly small -- $1 billion in total,

plus another $2 billion in associated merchandise trade exports.33

3. Why Liberalization Is Opposed
Looking at specific barriers and speculating on the prospects
for limiting their future use ignores the more basic question of

why most countries have responded coolly to U.S. proposals for
liberalization of trade in services.

If the experience with

merchandise trade is indicative, agreeing to eliminate specific

barriers without regard to their domestic objectives usually means
that other policies, possibly less desirable from an efficiency
perspective, will be substituted in short order.

Obviously, all the same kinds of economic and political
considerations -- employment,
adjustment, regional effects, etc. --

that

arise with liberalization of merchandise trade are equally

relevant for trade in services. But some additional domestic
considerations appear to be more important for services as a group
than for goods.
First, many types of services, from banking and

telecommunications to haircuts and restaurants, are subject to
extensive local regulation, either because they are considered
essential to national welfare and security or because they have
important potential effects on consumer health and safety.
Whatever their motive, regulatory barriers typically ensure aboveInternational Trade Commission (1982, 47). This document
also provides information by industry for each of the fourteen

providers particularly reluctant to share the market and potential
foreign providers particularly keen to enter.

Moreover, local regulation is likely to act as a barrier to
international competition even when the regulation is applied
evenhandedly to both domestic and foreign firms; the same
requirement is often more difficult and costly for a foreign firm

to meet because of language barriers or general unfamiliarity with

local legal and administrative procedures. But regulation often
does discriminate explicitly between domestic firms and foreigncontrolled suppliers.

For some particular sectors deemed "essential," a foreign
presence is considered undesirable or even unacceptable. For
example, the United States prohibits foreign ownership of radio and

television stations, while Brazil and Japan exclude foreign firms

in some telecommunications sectors. Many countries provide
essential services via a public monopoly. Even the United States
maintains a government monopoly in postal service.
For such sectors there are really two different cases for

excluding foreign firms. In some instances a nation may desire to
maintain permanent local control over a particular sector, even if

this control comes at a cost in terms of efficiency. Presumably a
national-security motive is present in most such cases.

For a

second group, the need "temporary" protection is justified by a
variant of the usual infant-industry argument.

The perceived need to protect infant service industries is an

49

important factor underlying the strong resistance of some

developing nations to GATT negotiations on services. Financial
services as well as telecommunications and associated informationbased services are frequently protected, with the goal of nurturing
a domestic provider not yet able to confront international

competition. However, because these services are important
intermediate inputs, protection raises costs and lowers efficiency
for all the using industries, thus lowering the odds of survival
for other, perhaps more promising, infants.

But as noted in Section III, it is theoretically possible for
liberalization to reduce national welfare unless a country is able
on average to expand its outputs in activities with scale

economies. This condition is unlikely to be met for most
developing nations, so that the theoretical case for developingcountry liberalization of service sectors is not airtight.
Finally,, some countries generally concerned about foreign

influence within their borders see liberalization of "trade" in
services as the start of a general assault on national policies

restricting direct foreign investment. Their alarm has some
justification, since U.S. firms pressing for expanded markets
abroad rarely distinguish between opportunities for trade and
opportunities for affiliate sales.

Overall, as in the case of merchandise trade, a variety of
arguments may be used to justify barriers against foreign

competition in service sectors. But, as in the case of merchandise
trade, the "national interest" arguments for continued protection

50

are put forward mainly by those whose own commercial interests
would be threatened by liberalization.

VII. Where and How to Negotiate_on_Services
Although the United States has succeeded in putting the
services issue on the agenda for the new GATT round, many questions
concerning future U.S. negotiations in this area remain to be

answered. This section considers two. First, what are the merits
of pursuing the services issue in other bilateral or multilateral
forums, in addition to or instead of the GATT?

Second, what are

the alternative strategies that might be used to make progress on
this admittedly difficult issue?

1.

Whereto Negotiate on Services
As a practical matter, it is too late to wonder whether the

United States is prepared to lead international negotiations on

service issues in the GATT.34 For better or worse, the decision
has been made and cannot be reversed without substantial loss of

credibility for the United States. Gaps in knowledge, both
analytical and empirical, remain significant but are beginning to

be filled. However, the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations is
expected to extend over a number of years.

In the meantime, what

might be accomplished by pursuing some of the same issues with
selected trading partners in other forums?

Since progress on service issues will require countries to
grapple with a whole new set of nontariff distortions of
international commerce, bilateral negotiations offer an opportunity

Krommenacker (1984) provides an insider's evaluation of
the potential role of the GATT in liberalizing trade in services.

52

to explore these issues with just one partner. In the case of
Canada, where broader bilateral negotiations on a free-trade area
are already in progress, there is a natural opportunity to test out

possible negotiating strategies. One special complication in this
case is Canada's provincial regulatory structure. However, given
the generally cordial relationship between the United States and
Canada and the high degree of integration of the two economies, any
approach that fails in this test case can probably be scrapped
without trying it out in the GATT.

A second possibility is to work initially within a group of
countries with a particular interest in pursuing liberalization in

the services area. This has been termed a "mini-lateral" approach
or a "GATT of the like-minded." Since the developing nations have
expressed the greatest reservations about services, such a group
would presumably be drawn from the OECD, or the OECD might become

the formal sponsor of a parallel negotiation.35 Agreements reached
within the group would have a conditional most-favored-nation (F4FN)

status, applying only to the nations agreeing to abide by the

terms.36 However, others could join the group later by agreeing to
the same terms.

The OECD has already sponsored considerable consultative
work on services. See Schott (1983) for an evaluation of OECD
initiatives and the relative merits of proceeding within the OECD
rather than the GATT.
Such conditionality represents a departure from the
central GATT principle of MFN treatment (nondiscrimination), under
which tariff concessions made by any member apply to all other
members. However, a similar appraoch was used in the Tokyo Round
for the codes of conduct on specific types of nontariff barriers.

53

While the benefits of learning-by-doing in a smaller
negotiation are real, there are some risks as well.

Bilateral or

minilateral negotiations create preferential trading arrangements
that become vested interests. This may reduce the motivation of
some GATT members to press for broader and more inclusive

agreements later on (Aho and Aronson, 1985). Another danger is
that the terms of a bilateral agreement with, say, Canada, may be
difficult to extend to other trading partners with stronger
comparative advantage in certain sectors (e.g.

,

transport,

construction).

2.

How to Negotiate on Services37

Here the basic choice is whether to organize the discussions
along sectora]. lines (e.g., insurance, telecommunications) or to

attempt as in the Tokyo Round to develop codes that cover
particular types of policies (e.g., subsidies, government
procurement policies) for all or most types of traded services.

Given the vast universe of policies that impinge on international
services competition, it is not possible to handle all relevant
issues through the second approach, so the question is really about
the degree of emphasis accorded to each.

One strategy to prevent the task from becoming unmanageable
is to begin by extending as far as possible the current GATT
framework on merchandise trade to services transactions.

This

Strategies for negotiating on services are discussed in
greater detail by Aronson and Cowhey (1984), Brock (1982), Gray
(1983), Malmgren (1985), Stalson (1985), and Sapir (1985).

54
approach would identify any "easy" liberalization gains from moving

negotiating efforts into virgin territory. At the same time,
information would be gained about the important specific issues
that do not fall easily into a framework paralleling that for
goods.

Another important issue is the extent to which liberalization

in service trade is linked to issues on goods. The two-track
compromise agreed on at Punta del Este suggests that linkage will

be minimal, at least at the start. Unfortunately, complete
separation places limits on the efficiency gains attainable through
multilateral negotiations, and especially potential North-South
agreements to make liberalization in labor-intensive manufactured
goods in the North the quid pro quo for high-technology and
services liberalization in the South.

One final strategic issue concerns timing. The conventional
wisdom is that the pressure of deadlines and media attention can
help negotiators to reach mutually beneficial compromises that

might otherwise prove elusive. With perhaps a decade of slogging
through difficult issues ahead, there is need for some short-term
goals where progress can be made, and announced, sooner.

55

VIII. Summing Up
The United States has indeed become a "service economy" -and
so have most U.S. trading partners, both
industrialized and

developing. But although domestic employment at home and abroad is
now heavily concentrated in the service
still dominate international trade.

industries, tangible goods

Moreover, the services that

absorb most of the labor force at home are not the same services
that account for most international

service transactions nor even

the ones ripe for global expansion in the near future.

Thus, the need to press forward on liberalization of services
must be justified along other lines

---

e.g.,

to maintain the

forward momentum in multilateral negotiations, or to restore

domestic support in the United States for open international

markets. Yet these arguments seem shaky if services are allowed to
displace important unfinished business in the traditional areas of

GATT efforts, especially safeguards. Also, if U.S. service firms
are interested mainly in expanding sales abroad of their foreign
affiliates rather than exports, as the greater importance of the
former in total revenues suggests, then the resulting base for

domestic support may be rather narrow.
But there are important positive

aspects to bringing services

into the GATT. Despite its

sometimes disappointing record, the
GATT remains the only international organization where rules are

taken seriously.38 Because services would be a new issue in the

38 Not necessarily followed, but at least taken
seriously. A
good example is the prolonged effort by the United States
to find a
"GATT--able" variant on its Domestic International Sales Corporation

56

GATT, there could be some easy gains to be made initially; in
merchandise trade, only the hard things are left to tackle.

Consideration of services would necessitate greater attention to
the links between trade and direct investment and between trade and
international movements of labor --

further

complicating the task

of GATT, but in a way likely to serve its ultimate objective of

pushing the world economy toward greater efficiency. And, finally,
because goods and services are inextricably (and increasingly)

intertwined in real transactions, progress on merchandise trade
will surely be slowed unless trade negotiators begin to think
seriously about services too.

constitute a very minor portion of the relevant totals. Thus, even highly
favorable conditions can be expected to have only a modest effect on
the aggregate international position of the United States, although such
conditions would provide substantial benefits to a number of U.S. firms.

stressed the expansion of service trade as a potential replacement for
lost market share in manufactured products, others have emphasized

sectors are distinguished here by the intangible nature of their output
and include both final-demand and
intermediate-input categories.
As table 6.3 shows. U.S. employment is now heavily concentrated
in the industries broadly described as service producing: transportation, public utilities, wholesale and retail trade, finance, insurance, real
estate, miscellaneous business services, health, and government. This
broad range of activities comprises all industries that are nor included
in the goods-producing sector, that is. manufacturing, construction,
mining, and agriculture. The employment classification in table 6.3 is
made on the basis of the industry's main output, which may be sold
to final consumers (health, education), used as an intermediate input
(business services), or both (restaurants).

6.4.2 Services in Gross National Product
A similar pattern emerges from an examination of U.S. gross tiational
product (GNP) by industry, as shown in table 6.7. In current dollars.
the service-producing sectors now account for over two-thirds of U.S.
GNP, up from about 55 percent immediately after World War Il. The
industrial classifications used in tables 6.3—6.7 include both intermediate and final products, and both government and private activities.
An alternative measure of the economic importance of services is
their share in final demand as measured by consumer spending. As

fallen in recent years. As table 6.6 indicates, the number of workers
in goods-producing employment actually rose between 1967 and 979.
even though the share of these sectors fell from 34.7 percent to 30.2
percent of the U.S. labor force. But a sharp recession in 1980—82
produced a substantial fall in goods-producing employment. Although
employment growth resumed in 1983, by 1986 the total number of
workers in the goods-producing industries was still well below previolls
peaks. Of course, employment in manufacturing and other goodsproducing sectors fell even more relative to the levels that would have
been attained had the distribution of the larger labor force among Ihe
major sectors remained unchanged from the 1967 pattern.

Tables 6.4 and 6.5 indicate the nation's labor force allocation ii'i
longer-term perspective. Table 6.5 shows the division of U.S. employment among three major sectors: agriculture, goods, and services. Here
agriculture includes forestry and fisheries; goods-producing employment includes mining and construction. Government employment is
allocated according to industry, with only public administration listed
as a separate service category.
Table 6.5 reveals that the growth of service-sector employment as a
share of the U.S. labor force is a trend going hack to 1850, the earliest
that
year for which data are available. However, until recent years

of
growth was accommodated mainly through the secular

of

agriculture's share. Agriculture accounted for about
employment in 1850 but less than 4 percent by the l980s.
In contrast, the share of goods-producing employment increased
steadily until the turn of the century and moved cyclically around the
one-third mark for many years thereafter. Only in the past twenty years
has growth of employment in service-producing industries come mainl
at the expense of manufacturing and the other nonagricultural goods'
producing sectors.
Even so, it is primarily the ,cliare of the goods-producing sectors ii

International Competition in Services

These

shares are calculated on the basis of local domestic prices.
However, prices of services tend to be higher relative to those of
tangible goods in countries with higher per capita GNP. When a common set of international prices is used to value outputs, the percentage
shares of services in GDP differ less markedly over time for a given
country or between rich and poor nations in a given year. Using realquantity indexes in place of value shares, Kravis, Heston. and Summers
(1983) show that in real terms, low-income countries may actually
consume services in higher proportions than wealthier nations. This
finding presumably reflects the very low relative prices of services in
poor countries.

6.5 International Service Transactions

The high priority placed by the United States on negotiations on
trade in services is frequently justified by assertions that this trade is
currently or potentially very important to the nation's overall international position. Yet the data on U.S. trade in services provide only
weak support for such a claim. Globally and also for the United States.
the aggregate size of services trade as reflected in balance ofpayments
data is roughly one-fourth that of merchandise trade. Moreover, that
