Equity is Cheap for Large Financial Institutions: The International Evidence

NBER Working Paper No. 22355
June 2016, Revised August 2017
JEL No. G12,G18,G2,G21
ABSTRACT
In most countries, equity is a cheap source of funding for a country’s largest financial institutions.
On average, the stocks of the top 10% financial companies in a country account for over a quarter
of total market capitalization, but these stocks earn returns that are significantly lower than stocks
of non-financial firms of the same size and with the same risk exposures. In a bailout-augmented
asset pricing model with rare disasters, country characteristics that inform the likelihood of a
bailout should predict stock returns. We find greater financial pricing anomalies for the largest
banks in developed countries with a highly concentrated and large banking sector and fiscally
strong governments, but smaller anomalies in countries with strong corporate governance,
government integrity, and property rights as well as high bankruptcy costs. The pricing
discrepancy widens in anticipation of large stock market and GDP declines, as the bailoutaugmented asset pricing model would predict.

Introduction

There is a wealth of evidence from credit markets that implicit government guarantees reduce the borrowing costs of large financial institutions. Our research shows that the largest financial institutions (the top
10%) seem to benefit from a lower cost of equity capital, but the size of the effect depends on a country’s
institutional and macroeconomic characteristics.
Government guarantees extended to financial institutions absorb risk that is otherwise borne by their
creditors and shareholders. These guarantees not only reduce the risk that financial stocks are exposed to,
but also impact the equilibrium stock returns after netting out the adjustment for standard risk. In the
Kelly, Lustig, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2016) bailout-augmented dynamic asset pricing model, which builds
on the rare event models of Backus, Chernov, and Martin (2011); Gabaix (2012); Wachter (2013), financial
stocks that benefit from guarantees earn low risk-adjusted returns during normal times, in anticipation of
shareholder bailouts in event of disasters. Under assumption of bailout, all firm and country characteristics
that determine the likelihood and extent of bailouts also predict risk-adjusted returns on financial stocks.
We find empirical evidence in a large panel of countries that supports these predictions of the model.
The clear implication is that regulators should not use stock-based risk measures, because these inevitably reflect the value of the guarantee. For example, Atkeson, Eisfeldt, and Weill (2013) find no
difference in financial soundness between U.S. financial and non-financial institutions prior to the 20072008 crisis, while Sarin and Summers (2016) find that investors do not see large U.S. banks as less risky
after the new wave of regulations and financial reforms. The authors attribute this to a decline in the
franchise value of banks, but our results indicate that the repricing of government guarantees may also
be the reason (see Bond and Goldstein (2015) for a theoretical analysis of the pitfalls of government
intervention when the government relies on market prices).
This paper makes three contributions. Our first contribution is to establish that equity is a cheap
source of capital for the very largest banks. One can see in Figure 1 that financial institutions that exceed
the 90th size percentile in their home country earn negative risk-adjusted returns that are statistically and
economically significant. This is truly a size effect rather than a market capitalization effect (Berk (1997)
discusses the distinction). The largest financial firms, measured by market cap (book value), earn 3.41%
(5.97%) lower returns than the largest non-financial firms after netting out risk compensation. Consistent
with the Minton, Stulz, and Taboada (2017) findings for the U.S., we do not find similar effects for

1

medium-sized banks.1 We also uncover significant differences between developed and emerging markets.
In developed markets, only the largest banks in the top size decile deliver negative risk-adjusted returns
(-3.29% per year); other financials do not. This is an important anomaly. On average, the largest financial
stocks account for 27% of the total market capitalization in our sample of countries. Thus, we see that
over the entire sample, the implied subsidy to the cost of equity capital for large financial firms is 2.68% of
gross domestic product (GDP). Furthermore, unlike other anomalies (for e.g., the momentum anomaly),
this anomaly does not rely on sophisticated dynamic trading strategies, but instead is highly persistent
at the firm level, and presumably has large effects on equilibrium allocations as a result (Van Binsbergen
and Opp (2017)).2
Our second contribution is that banks’ cost of equity adjusts in anticipation of a financial crisis.
Bank stock investors partly anticipate financial crises, contrary to the credit spread evidence reported
by Krishnamurthy, Muir, and Yale (2015) and the stock market evidence in Muir (2016) and Baron and
Xiong (2017).3 In that stock markets price in guarantees that are activated in financial crises, we find
that an increase in the expected return gap between small and large banks, measured by the difference
in dividend yields, forecasts large drops in GDP and the stock market. This is a discount rate effect.
In a rare disaster model with time-varying probabilities (Gabaix (2012); Wachter (2013)), an increased
probability of disaster increases the disaster risk premium spread between small and large banks, provided
that large banks are perceived to benefit from a stronger government guarantee.
Finally, equity is a cheaper source of funding for large banks when bailouts seem more likely and
more valuable. We correlate the spread in the average risk-adjusted return on size-sorted portfolios
of financial firms for each country with the regulatory, policy, and institutional framework of the each
country. Assuming efficient markets and no implicit bailouts, these correlations should be insignificant.
Nor are these cross-sectional effects consistent with mispricing or behavioral biases. Rather they point to
a rational pricing of government guarantees by bank shareholders, consistent with the bailout-augmented
asset pricing model. In a placebo test, we did not find similar correlations for non-financials.
1

Minton, Stulz, and Taboada (2017) define large banks as banks with total assets in excess of $50 bn.
Exposure to this anomaly also requires very limited turnover, which implies that adjusting for transaction costs would
have a very limited effect on its size. Except during financial crises, there is no evidence to suggest that shorting large
financial firms is costlier than shorting large non-financial firms.
3
It is rational to expect large banks to fare better during crises. We also verify that large financial firms fare much better
during economic crises in developed countries, even though they are more levered than smaller banks. A portfolio that goes
long in large financial firm stocks and shorts small financial firm stocks on average gains 16% during an economic crisis.
Finally, we find find that on average nearly 1% of the firms in the bottom 10th decile are delisted during an given quarter
that a country spends in an economic or financial crisis, while the corresponding number for the top 10th decile is only 0.20%.

We identify three main determinants of our results the characteristics of (i) the banking industry
itself, (ii) the government, and (iii) the institutional environment. First, the risk-adjusted large-minussmall return spread is wider in countries with a large depositor base, a dense network of branches, and a
heavily concentrated banking sector; all of these raise the likelihood of a bailout. Second, the size of the
risk-adjusted large-minus-small return spread also increases with the fiscal health of the government and
the size of its central bank balance sheet. Implicit bailout guarantees are credible only if governments
have the resources to back up these promises.4 Third, institutions matter as well. The large-minus-small
spread is significantly wider than average in countries with a common law legal system, and lower than
average in countries with a Scandinavian legal system as well in countries with high perceived government
integrity and stronger property rights. La Porta, Lopez-de Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (2000), for
example, show that shareholders are perceived to be better protected from expropriation in common law
countries. Governments in common law countries may be legally unable or else reluctant to wipe out the
shareholders of large financial institutions in the process of a bailout.5
Spreads are also wider in countries with weaker corporate disclosure and governance, as well as weaker
business regulations. Better corporate governance may reduce risk-taking in large banks, possibly by
limiting executive compensation thus reducing the value of the guarantee (Acharya, Amihud, and Litov
(2011) and Bebchuk, Cohen, and Spamann (2010)). Spreads are negatively correlated with bankruptcy
costs, presumably because the banks are less likely to increase leverage when the cost of bankruptcy is
high. While there are other possible explanations for our findings, such as missing risk factors or behavioral
issues, these would have trouble accounting for these cross-sectional correlations.
Large financial institutions do have high betas and higher systematic volatility. Yet, our findings are
not another example of the low-risk anomaly that has been documented for non-financials (see, e.g., Ang,
Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2009); Baker, Bradley, and Wurgler (2011)). We find no evidence to support a
betting-against-beta explanation as in Frazzini and Pedersen (2014). Large financial firms earn low returns
even when compared with large non-financial firms with the same betas and idiosyncratic volatility. In
addition, the returns on the largest financial firms do not co-vary with the Frazzini and Pedersen (2014)
4

Acharya, Drechsler, and Schnabl (2014) find that European bank credit default swap (CDS) spreads were highly correlated
with sovereign risk of the country of origin during the 2008 crisis. Our results indicate that sovereign risk is always a large
determinant of bank stock valuations, even before crises.
5
There are some recent judgements that support this notion. Recently, the U.S. courts ruled that the Federal Reserve
had illegally taken a large equity stake in AIG in 2008, thus expropriating its shareholders (New York Times, June 15, 2015),
while Fannie and Freddie shareholders have also challenged the Treasury’s profit sweep in courts. We also find that this
common law effect is mitigated by stronger corporate governance or creditor rights.

3

betting-against-beta factors.
Baron and Xiong (2017) find that U.S. bank dividend yields do not forecast bank crashes, while credit
expansion does, which they interpret as evidence that bank shareholders neglect tail risk and are at times
overly optimistic, possibly because of extrapolation (Gennaioli, Shleifer, and Vishny (2012) Barberis,
Shleifer, and Vishny (1998); Barberis, Greenwood, Jin, and Shleifer (2015)). Our work suggests that bank
shareholders price tail risk differentially into large and small bank stock prices, because an increase in the
spread in bank dividend yields forecasts stock market and GDP crashes. We cannot rule out that bank
shareholders are overly optimistic at times, but their optimism seems limited to the largest banks, and
concentrated in countries with regimes that favor shareholders of those banks.
If markets are efficient, then bank equity is not an expensive source of funding, as explained by Admati,
DeMarzo, Hellwig, and Pfleiderer (2011), and imposing higher capital requirements does not destroy bank
value. Baker and Wurgler (2015) counter that there is a low-risk anomaly in U.S. financials, and that
increased capital requirements may reduce the overall value of banks, because the reduction in volatility
and leverage increases the equity cost of capital. Our international evidence does not support the idea
that leverage-constrained investors (or any other investors) are responsible for bidding up the prices of
large bank stocks. Instead, we find evidence that equity is always a cheap source of funding for the largest
banks in a country. There is no obvious behavioral explanation for our findings.
There is a large literature on size effects in stock returns (see Banz (1981), Basu (1983), Fama and
French (1993), Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1994), Berk (1997) among others). Most of these papers
exclude financial stocks, presumably because of their high leverage. More recently, Gandhi and Lustig
(2015) (GL hereafter) analyze the size effect in bank stock returns in the U.S. and show that the largest
commercial banks in the U.S. have significantly lower risk-adjusted returns than small banks.6
Our work is also related to other research that shows direct evidence from options markets that tail
risk in the financial sector is priced differently.7 Kelly, Lustig, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2016) find that
out-of-the-money index put options of bank stocks were relatively cheap during the recent financial crisis
6

They find a considerable anomaly for U.S. bank stock returns. The average risk-adjusted return on the last decile portfolio
of bank stocks with the highest market capitalization (or book value) exceeds the average risk-adjusted return on the first
decile portfolio of bank stocks with the lowest market capitalization (or book value) by nearly 0.60% per month. Thus, GL
argue that the size anomaly in bank stocks in the U.S. is really about size, rather than market capitalization. This result is
consistent with government guarantees that protect shareholders of large, but not small, financial firms in disaster states.
7
There is also evidence that government guarantees reduce borrowing costs of large financial institutions. See Acharya,
Anginer, and Warburton (2013) for evidence. Office (2014) also finds all 42 of the econometric models that it considered to
estimate funding costs implied that large U.S. bank holding companies had significantly lower funding costs than small banks
prior to the financial crisis.

4

because the government absorbed sector wide tail risk. In related work on bank stock returns, Fahlenbrach,
Prilmeier, and Stulz (2012) document that banks that incurred substantial losses during previous crises
were more likely to incur losses during the recent crisis. If some banks benefit from greater perceived tail
risk subsidy, they have an incentive to load up on this type of risk.8
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the dataset, and explains how we construct
portfolios of financial firms sorted by size as measured by market capitalization and book value. Section
3 establishes a size anomaly in financial stock returns around the world. Section 4 shows that wide largeto-small financial spreads forecast economic downturns. Section 5 relates the size anomaly to a country’s
legal, business, financial, sovereign, and regulatory environment. Section 6 describes a bailout-augmented
dynamic asset pricing model based on Kelly, Lustig, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2016), which delivers pricing
relations consistent with our findings.

Identifying Financial Institutions in the Data

Our dataset includes the monthly equity returns, market capitalization, total book value of assets, and the
market/book ratio for financial firms from 31 countries. The data source is Thomson Reuters Datastream
(henceforth TRD). We select countries included in either the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI)
Developed or the MSCI Emerging Markets index. We further restrict the sample to countries that report
stock returns for at least 40 financial firms. For a country to be part of our sample, we also require that
data for equity returns and market capitalization be available for at least three years. The starting year
for data for a particular country is determined by the first full year in which the number of financial firms
in that country exceeds 40. The ending time for all is December 31, 2013. In all countries, we exclude
very small firms as measured by market capitalization by eliminating the 10% of firms with the lowest
market capitalization.
In TRD, we identify financial firms using the sector variable. This variable is based on the Worldscope
Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB) codes.9 ICB allocates a company to the sector of ICB codes
whose definition most closely coincides with the source of its revenue or the source of the majority of its
revenue. In any country, firms with sector values equal to banks, financial services, insurance, or real
8

In fact, shareholder value maximization requires that they do so, as pointed out by Panageas (2010), who analyzes
optimal risk management in the presence of guarantees. Interestingly, Fahlenbrach, Prilmeier, and Stulz (2012) find some
evidence that banks whose managers’ interests were more aligned with shareholders actually performed more poorly during
the recent financial crisis.
9
ICB classification benchmark codes are also referred to as the FTSE’s Global Classification system, because the classification was developed by FTSE Group and Dow Jones Index.

estate investment services are classified as financial firms. In other words, our definition of financial firms
includes banks (ICB Sector DS Level 4 code equal to 8350); non-life insurance (ICB Sector DS Level 4
code equal to 8530); life insurance (ICB Sector DS Level 4 code equal to 8570); real estate investment
services (ICB Sector DS Level 4 code equal to 8630); and financial services (ICB Sector DS Level 4 code
equal to 8770).
We include all financial firms, not just banks, for two reasons. First, there are significant differences
across countries in the way banks and financial services firms are organized. In the U.S., firms that
own a commercial bank and entities that provide other financial services are almost always classified as
bank holding companies. Bank holding companies are, first and foremost, banks; that is their economic
function, so restricting the sample to firms with sector values equal to banks seems inappropriate for the
U.S. In many other countries, firms that own a commercial bank as well as other financial entities may
be classified as banks, financial services, insurance, or real estate investment services firms10 . Second, in
the U.S., the largest financial firms as measured by market capitalization are banks or financial services
firms, but in many other countries the largest financial firms may be insurance or real estate investment
services firms. For example, the largest financial firm as measured by market capitalization in Australia
is AMP, an insurance firm. Similarly, the largest financial firm as measured by market capitalization in
Belgium is Ageas, another insurance firm. As a result, we decided to include all financial firms in our
sample.
We eliminate all observations where either the name of the firm, price, or market-capitalization data
is missing. Observations for firms that are cross-listed in more than one country are kept only in the
country of incorporation. For example, stocks for the bank HSBC trade in New York, London, Paris, and
Hong Kong. Since HSBC is incorporated in London, in our database, observations for HSBC appear only
with United Kingdom as its country. Cross-listed firms and countries of incorporation are identified using
the TRD data-item primary quote.
Within a particular country, multiple observations for the same firm within a month (for e.g., for
different share classes) are aggregated at the firm level by value-weighting the returns and price-to-book
values and aggregating (summing) the market value. For each country for each month, we winsorize the
returns at the 5th and 95th percentile levels to remove outliers. Finally, for a given firm, we identify
10

This is especially true given TRD’s classification system. In TRD a firm that owns a commercial bank and an investment
bank will be classified as financial services (i.e., ICB Sector DS Level 4 code equal to 8770) if the investment bank accounts
for more than 50% of the total revenue of the firm.

6

pairs of consecutive observations that have total equity returns that exceed 90%, are of the exact same
magnitude, but of opposite signs. An example of this would be a firm that has a total equity return of
95% in January 2013 and -95% in February 2013. We conclude that such entries are likely corrupt, and
set the return for this firm in January and February 2013 to be missing. All these changes are necessary,
given the data quality in TRD.
We can identify delisted firms because even after a firm delists, TRD continues to report its monthly
total equity return, market capitalization, and price-to-book as stale values that do not vary. We specify
the first month of a stale value series as the month the firm delists. Data for delisted firms are excluded
only after the month in which they delist. Thus, for firms that delist in January of any year, we set
monthly total equity returns, market capitalization, and price-to-book values as missing starting only in
February of that year. This ensures that the returns properly account for delistings. We also exclude
data for all firms that are inactive throughout the sample period by assuming that the investor liquidated
holdings of that firm at the final listed price. Our results are robust when we assume that the investor
lost all its holdings at the time of delisting. In a final step, we remove all observations for which the firm
name includes the word fund, mutual fund, income, or income fund. This filter ensures that our results
are not driven by mutual funds or other such investment services.
The final dataset consists of 1,418,532 observations across 31 countries. For all observations total
equity returns, market capitalization, total book value of returns, and the ratio of price-to-book value of
assets are denominated in local currency. We cross-check the TRD files with other providers to ensure
that our filters works well to identify financial firms.11
Panel A of Table 1 presents the list of countries in our sample and the number of unique financial firms
available throughout the sample period in each country. For each country in the sample, the table lists the
country classification (developed vs. emerging market), the start year for the data, the number of unique
financial firms in our dataset, the percentage of publicly listed firms that are classified as financial firms,
and the percentage of financial firm market capitalization as a percentage of total market capitalization
in the country. Note the substantial cross-sectional variation in number and size of financial firms across
11

We compare our list of U.S. financial firms from TRD to the list of the top 100 bank holding companies by total book
value of assets compiled by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company. The TRD list includes firms that account for 80.71%
of the total book value of assets of the top 100 bank holding companies in the U.S. The FDIC considers Macy’s, Nordstrom,
Apple Financial Holdings, and United Services Automobile Association as bank holding companies. DataStream (correctly)
does not identify these firms as banks or any other kind of financial firm because that is not their primary business function.
Similarly, the FDIC identifies BBVA, Deutschebank, HSBC, and Barclays as large U.S. bank holding companies. Our list
includes these firms in their country of incorporation but not as bank holding companies incorporated in the U.S.

7

countries. For example, in Japan and Taiwan, 10% of publicly listed firms are classified as financial firms,
but they account for less than 25% of market capitalization, while in Hong Kong, 34% of publicly listed
firms are classified as financial firms and they account for approximately 50% of the market capitalization.
The actual number of unique financial firms also varies by country. The U.S. has the largest number
of unique financial firms at 3,201 (accounting for 13.16% of total market cap), followed by India at 778
accounting for (9.35% of total market cap) and the United Kingdom at 778 (accounting for 17.85% of
total market cap). The South American countries Chile and Peru have the fewest unique financial firms
at 67 (accounting for 32.10% of total market cap) and 55 (accounting for 40.16% of total market cap),
respectively. On average, financial firms account for nearly 21% of firms and nearly 28% of the market
capitalization in our sample of 31 countries.
Next, we build size-sorted portfolios of financial intermediary stocks. For this, we employ the standard
portfolio formation strategy of Fama and French (1993). In each month, for each country, we sort all
financial firms into deciles according to market capitalization. So, for example, in January 2013, we rank
all financial intermediary stocks in each country by market capitalization. In each country stocks of
financial firms are then allocated to deciles on the basis of market capitalization. We then calculate the
value-weighted returns for each decile for each country for February 2013. In February 2013, we repeat
the process to calculate the same returns for March 2013. At the end of this exercise, we have monthly
value-weighted returns for each size-sorted portfolio of financial firms, for each country, over the entire
sample.12
Panel B of Table 1 reports summary statistics for the size-sorted deciles of financial firms. The statistics
are averaged across all countries, and separately across developed and emerging markets. Large and small
denote the portfolios of financial firms with the highest and lowest market capitalization, respectively, and
LMS denotes the return of large minus small financial firms. Panel B also reports the average number of
unique financial firms (N ); the average market capitalization of financial firms as a percentage of market
capitalization of the entire financial intermediary sector (%F Cap); the turnover rate i.e. the probability
(in %) that a firm migrates to another portfolio in the subsequent month (%T urn); and the average
value-weighted monthly return (Ret) for large and small portfolios. Here, and henceforth, we annualize
average returns by multiplying by 12, and express them in percentage by multiplying by 100.
12

Later, for benchmarking our results to the standard size-anomaly, we also repeat the porfolio formation exercise separately
for all non-financial firms in each of the 31 countries to get the monthly value-weighted returns for each size-sorted portfolio
of non-financial firms, for each country, over our entire sample.

8

Firms in the first decile account on average for 0.20% to 0.42% of the market capitalization of the
entire financial sector. On the contrary, the largest financial firms account for anywhere between 67%
and 76% of the market capitalization of the entire financial sector for emerging and developed markets,
respectively. Thus, it appears that, on average, the financial intermediary sector for the 31 countries
is concentrated, with the bulk of market capitalization held by the largest financial companies. There
are average of 143 unique financial firms in the small portfolio in a given country compared to 46 for
the large portfolio. This pattern also holds for the turnover rate – the probability that a small financial
firm migrates to another portfolio is only 13%, and the probability that a large financial firm migrates
to another portfolio is even lower at just 3%. This evidence is important for our asset pricing tests as it
implies that the performance of a portfolio strategy that goes long the large while shorting the small is
not driven by portfolio turnover.
The last two columns of panel B show that, on average, large financial firms underperform small
financial firms by 7.84% across all countries. This result is statistically significant at the 1% level. The
return to the LMS portfolio, which is the difference in the returns to large and small portfolios, is -3.74%
for developed markets and even more negative for emerging markets at -14.77%. Note that the wider gap
between the performance of small and large financial firms for emerging markets is driven mainly by the
small portfolio.

The Cost of Equity Capital for Financial Institutions

To estimate financial firm’s cost of equity capital, we start by adjusting the portfolio returns for exposure
to the standard risk factors that explain cross-sectional variation in average returns on portfolios of nonfinancial stocks. We find that small financial firms, measured by market capitalization, outperform a
benchmark portfolio of stocks, while large financial firms underperform.

3.1

Cost of Equity Capital after Risk Compensation

To evaluate the performance of financial firms, we use the Fama and French (1993) three-factor model.
We use Market, SMB, and HML to represent the returns on the three Fama-French stock factors, namely,
the market, small minus big, and high minus low, respectively. For each country, we construct local
Fama-French factors using data for all publicly listed entities in each country (including financial firms).
To construct the Market factor in each country, we measure the excess return on the market using the
9

value-weighted return on all stocks in that country minus the return on the one-month U.S. Treasury bill
rate (from Ibbotson Associates). For each country, we construct the local size factor (SMB) and the local
value factor (HML) using the six value-weighted portfolios of all stocks in that country sorted by size and
book-to-market, respectively. Thus our vector of risk factors includes: f t = [Market SMB HML] .
We estimate the time-series regression of excess returns to large and small portfolios, and their difference, denoted LMS, on the three Fama-French factors, and report the average risk-adjusted returns along
with their statistical significance in Table 2. The columns titled Fin report the estimates for financial
firms. Because there is variation in the characteristics of firms across countries, we directly compare sizesorted portfolios of financial firms to size-sorted portfolios of non-financial firms within the same country.
To form the size-sorted portfolios of non-financial firms, we apply the standard Fama and French (1993)
portfolio formation strategy to all firms not classified as financial firms within a particular country. The
columns titled Non-fin report the results for non-financial firms. Finally, the last two columns of the
table report the average risk-adjusted performance of portfolios of financial firms relative to non-financial
firms.
Panel A reports pooled estimates for all countries.13 The risk-adjusted return on the portfolio of
largest financial firms is -2.41% (annualized) with a t-stat of -2.41 compared to 8.07% (annualized) for
the smallest financial firms with a t-stat of 3.75. Thus, the risk-adjusted return to the LMS portfolio
for financial firms in our sample is -10.47%, statistically significant at the 1% level. In other words, a
zero-cost portfolio that goes long $1 in the portfolio of largest financial firms by market capitalization and
short $1 in a portfolio of the smallest financial firms by market capitalization loses 10.47% per year over
the entire sample.
The risk-adjusted returns for both large and small non-financial firms are positive at 1.46% and 3.98%,
respectively. Thus, the alpha (risk-adjusted return) of the LMS for non-financial firms is much less negative
at -2.52% and is statistically significant at only the 10% level. We compare the country-level risk-adjusted
performance of size-sorted financial and non-financial firms in Figure 2. Taken together, the LMS portfolio
for financial firms delivers a risk-adjusted return that is approximately 8% lower than the LMS portfolio
of non-financial firms (the solid black line in Figure 2). Nearly half of this occurs because large financial
firms underperform large non-financial firms by 3.86%. Thus, across 31 countries, stocks of large financial
firms seem consistently overpriced compared to a benchmark of non-financial firms of the same size, even

after adjusting for exposure to standard risk factors.
Panels B and Panel C of Table 2 report estimates for data pooled separately for developed and emerging
markets. The risk-adjusted return to the LMS portfolio for financial firms in developed markets at -9.47%,
is comparable to that for emerging markets at -13.82%. The overpricing of stocks of large financial firms
relative to stocks of large non-financial firms is also comparable across developed and emerging markets
at nearly -4.31% and -3.70%, respectively.14
Table 3 evaluates the performance of the large portfolio of financial firms in terms of specific businesses.
That is, for each country we separately analyze the returns of size-sorted portfolios of banks and financial
services firms, insurance firms, and real estate investment services firms as identified by the TRD data-item
sector. Panel A reports the results for data pooled across all countries.
Over the full 1980 - 2013 sample, the risk-adjusted return for the largest banks and financial services
firms is -2.01%, compared to just -0.29% for the insurers and -2.28% for the largest real estate firms.
Over 2000-2013, the top decile of banks and financial services firms loses approximately -3.16% per year
in risk-adjusted terms compared to -1.44% for insurance firms (not statistically significant) and -2.07%
for real estate firms (only marginally statistically significant).
In developed markets, banks benefit from special provisions: deposit insurance, access to special
lending facilities at central banks, and implicit or explicit guarantees to creditors. Insurance and real
estate investment firms rarely enjoy the same level of protection. Given this background, it may seem
surprising that large real estate investment firms also deliver negative risk-adjusted returns. To understand
why large insurance and real estate investment services firms also perform poorly, we separately analyze
developed and emerging markets in Panels B and C. Much of the underperformance of developed markets
is concentrated in banks. Over 2000-2013, for the subset of developed countries the risk-adjusted return
on the largest banks is -6.40% (t-stat of -3.48), compared to -1.35% in insurance firms (not statistically
significant) and -1.30% for real estate firms (not statistically significant). Further, while the risk-adjusted
return on large banks declines monotonically over time, this is not the case for insurance and real estate
firms. For emerging countries, only real estate firms are found to deliver abnormally low average returns
of -3.72% over the full sample and in the recent sample (when it loses significance).
A statistically significant loss for a long-short portfolio for financial firms other than banks and financial
services can be explained by important differences in the way banks and financial services firms are
14

The difference between the LMS portfolio of financial and non-financial firms is -6.26% in developed markets, but -12.21%
in emerging markets, driven entirely by the risk-adjusted returns of the smallest financial firms in emerging markets.

11

organized across different countries. In the U.S., firms that own a commercial bank and entities that
provide other financial services are almost always classified as bank holding companies. In many other
countries, firms that own a commercial bank as well as other financial entities may be classified either as
banks, financial services, insurance, or real estate investment services firms. In fact, in TRD, an entity
that owns a commercial bank and other subsidiaries would always be classified as a “non-bank” financial
intermediary if the commercial bank accounts for less than 50% of its total revenues. Further, in the
U.S., the largest financial firms as measured by market capitalization are banks or financial services firms.
These are exactly the kind of firms that benefit from implicit government guarantees and are considered
too-big-to-fail. In many other countries, the largest financial firms as measured by market capitalization
may be insurance or real estate investment service firms.
Tables A2 and A3 in Appendix C provide further results for the largest financial firms or financial
firms sorted by the type of business they engage in. Table A2 shows the results for size-sorted portfolios
of firms that are classified as banks and financial services firms only and Table A3 presents the results
for the top three largest commercial bank in each country. When we restrict the sample to just banks
and financial services firms, the risk-adjusted return on the LMS portfolio is more negative at -11.37%,
again statistically significant at the 1% level or better. Table A3 shows that, when we restrict the sample
to just the largest banks in each country, the risk-adjusted returns are on average -5.16% for developed
markets and +3.81% for emerging markets.
Thus, it appears there are important differences in the size anomaly across emerging and developed
markets. There may also be important cross-country differences in regulatory, bank supervision, and
crisis-response policies that may drive differences in the magnitude of the size anomaly across different
countries.

3.2

Financials’ Cost of Equity Depends on Size

We directly compare the performance of large and small financial firms with similar loadings on standard
risk factors. For each country, for each financial intermediary in our sample, we estimate loadings on the
three Fama-French factors in a given month using data for the prior 12 months. We roll the regression
one month at a time to obtain a time series of factor loadings for each financial intermediary in each
country in our sample. Next, in each month, for each country, we sort all financial firms into 10 portfolios
by loadings on the SMB factor. We compute the firm Z-score as Z = std(βMarket ) + std(βHML ), where std
12

denotes cross-sectional standardization, for each financial intermediary. Finally, in each month, we match
a financial firm in the large portfolio to the financial firm in the small portfolio in the same SMB decile
and with the closest Z-score possible. We form value-weighted returns for all financial firms in the large
portfolio and in the small portfolio of matched firms.15
At the end of this exercise, we have monthly value-weighted returns for large and small portfolios
of financial firms that differ by market capitalization but have similar loadings on the Fama-French size
factor, SMB. We report the average risk-adjusted returns for the large, matched small, and large minus
matched small (LMS) portfolios in Panel A in Table A4 in Appendix C. The LMS portfolio loses about
7.59% in risk-adjusted terms per year over the entire sample. This number, although 2.88% lower than
the risk-adjusted number for the size-sorted deciles, is still statistically and economically significant.
In Panel B of Table A4 in Appendix C we present results for financial firms matched on the Market
factor. That is, we compare the risk-adjusted return for financial firms that differ in market capitalization
but have similar market betas. Now the large-minus-small LMS portfolio loses about 10.24% in riskadjusted terms per year over the entire sample. The loss increases to 12.45% by 2000-2013, which is even
higher than the -10.83% reported in Panel A for the same period. Overall, the size anomaly does not
appear to be impacted by the loadings on standard risk factors.
Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2009) show that firms with high idiosyncratic volatility earn lower
average returns than firms with low idiosyncratic volatility. Baker and Wurgler (2015) have revisited this
anomaly in the context of U.S. banks. To make sure that the size anomaly is not merely capturing this
spread, we match large financial firms to small financial firms with the closest idiosyncratic volatility,
computed as the standard deviation of the residuals in the rolling regression on the three Fama-French
factors. Panel C of Table A4 in Appendix C shows that small financial firms still outperform large financial
firms with comparable idiosyncratic volatility by 8% on a risk-adjusted basis.
We also carefully compare size-sorted portfolios of financial and non-financial firms (Table A5 in
Appendix C). We note that the risk-adjusted returns of the Financial-minus-Non-Financial LMS portfolio
have been rather stable over different sample periods at about -8%. Panel A of this table also shows that
it is the underperformance of large financial firms that increasingly accounts for a large proportion of the
difference between financial and non-financial firms. By 2000-2013, the total spread between financial and
non-financial firms is -7.82%, nearly 60% (-4.37%) of which can be traced to firms in the top decile.
15

When there are no small firms in a given SMB decile, we assign the risk-free rate.

13

The size distribution of financial and non-financial firms can be quite different. To make the results
more directly comparable, next we sort all financial and non-financial firms into size bins using the decile
breakpoints based on the market capitalization of all traded stocks in a country (i.e. both financial
and non-financial firms). We then apply these common decile breakpoints to separately form size-sorted
portfolios of both financial and non-financial firms. The results are in Panel B of Table A5. Here, by
design, the financial and non-financial firms in each portfolio are roughly of the same size. The valueweighted risk-adjusted return for financial firms in the last size bin are now 14.22% lower than those in the
first bin. For non-financial firms, the size anomaly is a mere -5.05%. By 2000-2013, this size anomaly for
financial firms increases to -14.71% while that for non-financial firms drops to -4.77%. Thus, the anomaly
for financial firms is at least three times greater than for non-financial firms.
The results of financial and non-financial firms sorted by book value of assets are in Panel C of Table
A5. Market capitalization measures size, but it also measures expected returns. Firms that generate
more cash flow will tend to have higher market capitalization, but firms with lower expected returns,
holding cash flows constant, may also have higher market capitalization. Of course, this argument does
not apply to other measures of size such as book value. For example, while market cap sorts are likely
to be picking up liquidity effects, book sorts are likely not to. A priori, there is no reason to expect
a relation between book values and expected returns. Berk (1997) thus argues that there should be a
relation between expected returns and market capitalization.
Panel C shows a similar pattern in risk-adjusted returns when sorting by book value of assets to the
pattern when sorting by market capitalization; it is in fact even stronger than the one documented in
Panel A. For non-financial firms, there is no evidence of a size anomaly when firms are sorted by book
value of assets. For non-financial firms, the value-weighted risk-adjusted return on the large portfolio is
5.51% higher than that on the small portfolio. As a result, the spread between the LMS portfolio of
financial and non-financial firms is now -14.44%. The sort by book value reveals that for financial firms
actual size as measured by book value seems to be a key determinant of returns. That is, larger financial
firms have negative abnormal returns.16
16
Table A6 in Appendix C confirms this evidence when we run the standard characteristics regressions separately for
financial firms, banks, and non-financial firms for all countries in the sample. For financial firms, when we run a crosssectional regression of average annual returns on firm characteristics (log of market capitalization and log of book value
of assets), we obtain a negative coefficient for log book value (-5.20%) as well as for market capitalization (-5.16%) both
statistically significant at the 1% level. When we include both log book value and market capitalization, however, the
coefficient on book value for financial firms is at least four times higher than the coefficient on market value. Further, the
coefficient on market capitalization is not statistically significant at conventional levels. These results suggest that a 100%
increase in the book value of financial firms above the sample average reduces annual returns by nearly 400 basis points for

14

As a final check, we also compare the risk-adjusted return on large financial firms and a set of large
non-financial firms that are similar along various dimensions of risk. Analogous to Table A4 we match
large financial firms to large non-financial firms according to loadings on the SMB factor or idiosyncratic
volatility. In untabulated results, we find that large non-financial firms still significantly underperform
large non-financial firms on a risk-adjusted basis by -6.50% (when matched by loadings on SMB) and by
-3.50% (when matched by idiosyncratic volatility).

3.3

Robustness

We carry out a battery of additional tests to check that the size anomaly for financial firms is robust
to a number of changes in experiment design and specification. We confirm that the baseline results are
robust to the use of delisting returns, alternative winsorization schemes, sorting techniques, equal-weighted
returns, and risk factors.

Delisting returns:

Accounting for delisting returns is important, as research shows that the extent

of empirical asset pricing anomalies can be sensitive to the treatment of delisting returns. Adjusting
for delisting returns is also important if delisting rates for financial firms are different from those of
non-financial firms, and if delisting rates are a function of firm size.17
To see whether our results are robust to delisting returns, we begin by identifying delisted firms in
TRD. We can take advantage of the fact that even after a firm delists, TRD continues to report its monthly
total equity return and market capitalization as a stale value that does not vary. We then impute a -100%
return to the stock return of all delisted firms so identified. The imputation of a -100% return in this case
is equivalent to assuming that all delistings are on account of financial distress or bankruptcy.18
We use this new data series (with the -100% imputed returns), to form size-sorted portfolios (sepaa typical financial firm, holding market capitalization fixed.
The columns titled banks in Table A6 show that a similar effect pertains for banks. For banks, size measured by both book
value and market capitalization is negatively correlated with returns. Once we control for book value, however, the relation
between size as measured by market capitalization and returns is not statistically significant. In most cases the coefficient
on book value is at least nine times higher than the coefficient on market capitalization.
The last column reports the results for non-financial firms. For non-financial firms, size as measured by market capitalization
drives out any relationship between book value and returns. Over the entire sample the coefficient on market capitalization
is nearly twice as high as the coefficient on book value, although neither coefficient is statistically significant. Overall, size
explains less than 2% of the variation in annual returns for non-financial firms but nearly 5% of the variation in returns of
financial firms and banks in our sample.
17
For example, Gandhi and Lustig (2015) show that in the U.S., small banks are delisted ten times more than large banks.
18
Clearly the assumption that all firms delist for financial distress is a strong one. Beaver, McNichols, and Price (2007)
analyze reasons for delisted firms in the stock return dataset provided by the Center for Research in Security Prices and find
that more than half the delistings are on account of mergers and acquisitions not related to financial distress.

15

rately) for financial and non-financial firms in each country. Table A7 in Appendix C shows that delisting
returns barely impact our result. The return on the large-minus-small LMS portfolio for financial firms
improves only slightly from -10.47% in Table 2 to -9.11% in Table A7 and remains statistically significant
at the 1% level or better.

Winsorization:

In our baseline results, given the data quality in TRD, we winsorize raw data for stock

returns from TRD at the 5th and 95th percentile. There is a chance that winsorization at these levels is a
severe response and may exclude valid return observations that could substantially impact the results.
Panel A of Table A8 presents the results with the data winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentile levels.
The risk-adjusted return on the portfolio of largest financial firms is -2.28% with a t-stat of -2.22 compared
to -2.41% with a t-stat of -2.41 in Table 2. The risk-adjusted return to the LMS portfolio for financial firms
is still large and negative at -18.96% (statistically significant at the 1% level). The risk-adjusted returns for
both large and small non-financial firms are positive at 1.13% and 10.76%, respectively. Finally, the alpha
of the LMS portfolio for financial firms is 9.33% lower than the α of the LMS portfolio of non-financial
firms.

Accounting for the January effect:

Reinganum (1983) shows that small firms experience high returns

in January and exceptionally high returns during the first few trading days in January. Keim (1983) also
shows that the relation between size and abnormal returns is more pronounced in January than in any
other month; nearly 50% of the size effect is driven by abnormal returns in January. To ensure that the
January effect does not drive the fact that large financial firms underperform small financial firms, Panel
B of Table A8 presents risk-adjusted returns for data pooled across all countries but after excluding all
returns for January in each year over the sample period. The alpha of the LMS portfolio for financial
firms is -6.91% lower than the α of the LMS portfolio of non-financial firms, which is only 100 basis points
lower.

Equal-weighted versus value-weighted returns:

Our results are also unchanged when we use either

value-weighted or equal-weighted portfolio returns. In Panel C of Table A8, the risk-adjusted return on
the equal-weighted portfolio of the largest financial firms is -1.81%. The risk-adjusted return to the LMS
equal-weighted portfolio for financial firms is still high and negative at -11.81% (statistically significant
at the 1% level). Finally, the alpha of the LMS equal-weighted portfolio for financial firms is 8.51% less
16

negative than the α of the LMS portfolio of non-financial firms.

Sub-sample analysis:

We examine the time variation in the size of the risk-adjusted performance to

the LMS portfolio and report average risk-adjusted returns computed using the three-factor Fama-French
1993 model over different subsamples in Panel A of Table A9 in Appendix C. The first two columns report
estimates for the longest available sample for each country, and coincide with those in Panel A of Table
2. The next two columns are for 1990-2013, and the last two columns are for 2000-2013.
The loss on LMS portfolio of financial firms increases to 10.84% over 1990-2013 and to 10.83% over
2000-2013. The progressively more negative performance of LMS is attributable to a worsening in underperformance of the largest financial firms over time from -2.41% for the full sample to -3.00% for
2000-2013. The small portfolio, by contrast, consistently outperforms the benchmark portfolio of stocks
by about 8% in all periods.

Returns denominated in U.S. dollars:

Panel B of Table A9 shows the results for returns denomi-

nated in U.S. dollars using the U.S., the regional, or the global Fama-French factors to risk-adjust returns.
The regional factors are available for 4 regions: Asia, Japan, Europe, and North America. We apply the
corresponding regional factors when we analyze returns denominated in U.S. dollars for countries located
in each region. Finally, we also use the global Fama-French factors (data available from Kenneth French’s
website). Panel B of Table A9 shows that whatever the factor model, the LMS portfolio of financial firms
loses at least 10% (approximately) over the entire sample.

Additional risk factors:

We test if our results are robust to the inclusion of additional risk factors

such as “betting against beta” (BAB) factor from Frazzini and Pedersen (2014), a co-skewness factor from
Harvey and Siddique (2000), and the idiosyncratic volatility factor of Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang
(2009). We control for the BAB factor because larger financial firms are more levered and hence higher
market betas are imputed to large financial intermediary stock portfolios. Frazzini and Pedersen (2014)
show that high beta assets are associated with low average risk-adjusted returns. They also document that
a long-short portfolio that goes long high-beta stocks and short low-beta stocks generates significantly
negative risk-adjusted returns. Baker and Wurgler (2015) also argue that a low-risk anomaly is present
in U.S. banks and could be linked to degree of leverage.
In addition, we control for the co-skewness factor because by granting shareholders of large financial
17

firms a menu of out-of-the money put options, the government reduces the negative co-skewness of large
financial intermediary stock returns, and Harvey and Siddique (2000) already show that co-skewness is
priced in the cross-section of U.S. stock returns. We follow the procedure in Harvey and Siddique to
construct the traded co-skewness factor for each country in our sample.
Finally, we construct a volatility factor as the return to a portfolio that goes long stocks of financial
firms in the bottom decile of idiosyncratic volatility and short the stocks of financial firms in the top decile
of idiosyncratic volatility.
Panel C of Table A9 shows estimates for average risk-adjusted returns for the augmented five-factor
model. As is clear from the table, our results are essentially unchanged. The annual return on a portfolio
that goes long $1 in a portfolio of large financial firms and short $1 in a portfolio of small financial firms
is still large, negative, and statistically significant. The loss on this portfolio is 10.94% (11.03% in the
most recent sample) when these additional risk factors are included, and is still statistically significant at
conventional levels.

Results for the largest financial firms:

Finally, we focus on the very largest firms in each country.

We present results for the value-weighted portfolio of the top n financial firms in each country in Panel D
of Table A9. Each row corresponds to a distinct value of n, 3, 5, or 10. Over the full sample, a significant
share of the negative alpha on the tenth decile is due to the very largest financial firms. The top three
financial firms by size account for nearly 67% of the risk-adjusted return for the largest financial firms.
The loss for the largest three financial firms increases to -2.72% over the 2000-2013 sample, compared to
-2.16% for the largest then financial firms. Thus, over 2000-2013, the risk-adjusted return for the top 3,
5, or 10 financial firms by size across all countries accounts for 90%, 80%, or 70% of the risk-adjusted
return of all financial firms in the tenth decile.

3.4

Cost of Implicit Guarantees

If the differences in the average risk-adjusted returns of large and small financial firms is the result of
financial crisis tail risk insurance offered to large (but not small) financial firms, our methodology allows
us to compute a direct estimate of this insurance on the cost of equity capital of financial firms. To this
end, we first regress the returns to LMS on the three Fama and French (1993) stock risk factors for each
country, and store the resulting abnormal return or alpha. Next, for each country, we multiply this alpha
18

by the average market capitalization of firms in the large portfolio. We then normalize this quantity by
the gross domestic product (GDP) of the country as of December 2013.
Table A10 in Appendix C reports the average of this normalized quantity across different groups and
time periods. All entries in the table are negative, meaning that the total effect is consistent with tail risk
subsidy. Panel A shows estimates averaged across all countries. We see that over the entire sample, the
subsidy to the cost of equity capital for large financial firms is 2.68% of GDP. By 2000-2013, this figure
increases to as much as 3.45% of GDP.
In Panel B, we report averages separately for developed and emerging markets. The subsidy in
developed markets is always greater than in emerging markets. In the most recent sample, the difference
is quite significant, with developed markets averaging 5.39% of GDP compared to 1.08% figure for emerging
countries. In USD terms, these differences are even more stark if we consider that the average GDP of
developed markets in our sample is $2,270 billion in December 2013 compared to only $206.63 billion for
emerging markets.
Finally, Panel C collects averages by geographical region. Note that the subsidy is the highest for
Asia Pacific countries, followed by Americas, the Middle East, and Africa. In USD terms, the subsidy is
highest for Asia ($1,356 billion), and for the Americas ($759 billion), and lagged by Europe ($129 billion)
and the Middle East ($17 billion).
It is worth noting that our estimates of the subsidy measure only impact of tail risk insurance on the
cost of equity capital. As financial institutions are highly levered, even if the direct effect on the overall
cost of capital may be minute, the indirect effect would note be because shareholders are last in line, the
implied subsidy to other bank creditors would be even greater.

Financials’ Cost of Equity Capital and the Probability of a Financial
Crisis

A financial crisis is typically defined as an event during which a country’s financial sector experiences runs
and sharp increases in financial sector default rates accompanied by large losses of capital that result in
public intervention, bankrutpcy, or the forced merger of financial institutions. In the event of a financial
crisis, governments and regulators often provide an implicit guarantee to shareholders of large financial
institutions, but not to those of small financial institutions. This is true not only for the U.S. but also for

19

most developed and emerging markets included in our samples.19
The presence of implicit government guarantees would induce a systematic link between a financial
firms’ exposure to tail risk (associated with the risk of a financial crisis) and firm size. The model
we define below suggests that these implicit guarantees will impact the expected returns of size-sorted
portfolios of financial firms. If a financial firm is considered too-big-to-fail, then its expected return is
lower in equilibrium than a smaller financial firm holding the exact same assets. Further, variation in
the probability of financial crisis will drive variation in the expected returns of size-sorted portfolios of
financial firms over time. In other words, not only are the expected returns of large financial firms lower
than those of small financial firms, but the expected return gap between large and small financial firms is
directly proportional to the probability of a financial disaster.
Historically, the probability of a financial disaster increases during economic and market downturns.
In the U.S. data, there is a strong connection between the business cycle and the incidence of financial
crisis.20 Therefore, we next study the link between the differences in the returns of large and small
financial firms and the potential risk of a future economic downturn. Our hypothesis is that if the size
anomaly is indeed driven by implicit guarantees, an increase in the expected return gap between small
and large financial firms is, on average, associated with an increase in the probability of an economic or
market downturn (hence a financial crisis) in the near future. As long as financial crises are not perfectly
correlated across countries, our international panel structure enhances identification and increases the
power of our test.
Table 4 presents the estimates from a panel conditional fixed-effect logit regression. The dependent
variable is a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 when the H-month ahead return on the aggregate
stock market index (for Panel A) or the H-month ahead growth rate of gross domestic product (for Panel
B) is below the 10th percentile level, with H = {3, 6, 9, 12}. The independent variable is the monthly
value-weighted dividend yield of large over small financial firms.
We expect that as the probability of a financial crisis increases, the risk premium on large-minussmall LMS increases; i.e., the expected return on the LMS portfolio becomes more negative. This in turn
implies that the difference between the dividend yield of large and small financial firms should become
19
For example, Laeven and Valencia (2008) document that in most countries, an emerging financial crisis results in direct
liquidity injection, large-scale government intervention, or even blanket guarantees extended to customers, creditors, and
shareholders of large financial institutions.
20
See, for example, Romer and Romer (2015) among others for the link between financial crisis and economic and market
downturns.

20

more negative. That is, the sign on the monthly value-weighted dividend yield of large over small financial
firms should be negative. This is exactly what we see in the data.
An increase in the expected return gap between small and large banks indicates an increase in the
probability of a drop in the stock market or a drop in GDP. A 1% increase in the dividend yield gap
increases the odds of a 10% drop in the stock market over the next three months by nearly 13% and that
of a 10% drop in GDP by approximately 10%. Thus, the size anomaly in financial firm returns appears
to be a reliable measure of future economic downturns, and is sensitive to changes in the probability of
a financial crisis in the near future. This evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that the existence of
implicit government guarantees to shareholders of large financial firms drives the observed size anomaly
in size-sorted portfolios of financial firms.
If large financial institutions benefit from government implicit guarantees, we should also expect that
the performance of the LMS portfolio, while negative on average, should improve (i.e. turn positive)
during crisis periods when large firms are in fact shielded. We investigate whether this is indeed the case
in Table 5, which collects the returns to the LMS portfolio during an economic or financial crisis.
As before, for each country in our sample, we identify an economic or a financial crisis as a quarter
during which the GDP or stock market return falls below the 10th percentile for that country. If there
are consecutive quarters that meet this criterion in any country, they are counted as one incident of an
economic or financial crisis. For each country, for each economic or financial crisis, we consider a $100
investment in the long-short LMS at the start of the crisis, and measure its cumulative performance at
the end of the crisis.
Each row in Panel A of the table displays the average performance of this investment over all economic
and financial crisis in each country in our sample. In Panel B, we report the average performance of this
long-short portfolio over all crises across all countries, developed markets only, and emerging markets only.
Table 5 shows that such a portfolio on average gains 6% during an economic crisis. Thus, the LMS
portfolio is sensitive to large slowdowns in the economy (i.e., performance improves during economic
or financial contractions). We attribute this result to differences in shareholder recovery rates on these
portfolios under economic or financial distress. During economic or financial crisis, large financial firms
fare much better even though they are typically more leveraged than small financial firms. In other words,
as the probability of a financial disaster increases (during economic or financial crisis), the expected return
gap between large and small financial firms grows, and large financial firms do much better than smaller

21

financial firms (in realized returns).
The performance of the LMS portfolio during an economic and financial crisis may be attributed partly
to differences in delisting rates. It is well established that governments and regulators, due to the implicit
bailout guarantee, are not willing to let large financial firms fail, even if they regularly allow individual
small financial firms to go under. Therefore, the last three columns in Table 5 report the delisting rates of
firms within the top and bottom 10th percentile in each country, as a percentage of total number of firms
in these portfolios at the start of the economic or financial crisis. The table shows that on average, 0.86%
of the firms in the bottom 10th decile fail during an economic crisis, while the corresponding number for
the top 10th decile is only 0.20%. These numbers imply that in each quarter in which a given country in
our sample is in an economic or a financial crisis, on average 2 small financial firms fail. The total number
of crisis quarters across all 31 countries in our sample is 331. This implies that on average 662 small
financial firms delisted over all financial crises across the 31 countries in our sample. The corresponding
number for large financial firms is 30.
Table 5 also highlight clear differences between developed and emerging markets in the crisis performance of the LMS portfolio. While for developed markets, the LMS portfolio on average gains 16%, for
emerging markets this portfolios loses approximately 2% of its value. These differences suggest that there
may be significant cross-sectional (cross-country) differences in the size anomaly in the financial sector,
which result from the implicit bailout guarantee provided by regulators. These differences may be closely
related to the legal, economic, policy, regulatory, and institutional frameworks in a particular country.

Determinants of Financials’ Cost of Equity Capital

So far, we have established that the size anomaly for financial firms is very different from that for nonfinancial firms and is also distinct from the market capitalization effect first documented by Banz (1981).
We have also shown that the differences in risk-adjusted returns for financial firms cannot be imputed to
differences in exposures to standard risk factors. We exploit the cross-sectional dimension of the dataset to
lend further support to the claim that this anomaly is related to the presence of implicit bailout guarantees
to large financial institutions.
We begin by relating the extent of financial sector tail risk insurance, as captured by the difference
in the average risk-adjusted return on the size-sorted portfolios of financial firms for each country to the
country’s legal, business, financial, and regulatory framework. If the size anomaly for financial firms is

22

merely an extension of the market capitalization effects documented in the literature for non-financial
firms, then the time-series/cross-sectional variation in the extent of the anomaly should not be related
to variables that measure the institutional environment. The converse is that, if the underperformance
of large financial firms indeed occurs because of explicit or implicit guarantees extended to large but
not small financial firms, we expect a more severe anomaly (a more negative result) when a country’s
regulatory, policy, and institutional framework makes bailouts more likely in the event of a financial crisis.
We also expect a greater anomaly in countries where financial firms respond rationally to a lower cost of
capital (due to implicit guarantees) by increasing risk.
We use a standard panel regression framework to study the relation between the size anomaly in
financial stock returns and a country’s legal, business, financial, and regulatory framework. The dependent
variable in each case is the large-minus-small LMS returns (i.e., the difference in the risk-adjusted return to
large minus small financial firms), computed using data for all financial firms over 2-year non-overlapping
windows. While all the results use data for all financial firms to compute LMS, most of our results are
robust either to using data for just banks or to using the difference in the risk-adjusted returns of financial
and non-financial firms.
Note that our panel regressions include country fixed effects and time-fixed effects where applicable.
In all the panel regressions we almost always include country fixed effects and also account for time fixed
effects whenever there is sufficient time-series and cross-sectional variation in the dependent variables.

Legal Environment

Table 6 examines the relation between the size anomaly in financial stock returns and the legal environment
in a country using a standard panel regression framework. The independent variables are a set of dummy
variables that take for the origin of the legal system in a country a value of either British (LU K ), French
(LF R ), German (LGR ), or Scandinavian (LSC ), and zero otherwise.
As explanatory variables we also include an index of property right index (P roperty), an index of
how left-leaning the federal (central) government is (Lef t), and an index of government integrity in each
country in our sample (Integrity). Higher values of P roperty, Lef t, and Integrity imply that the country
has stronger property rights, a more left-leaning federal government, and a lower levels of corruption (or
perception of corruption).21
21

The data for the legal origin come from La Porta, Lopez-de Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (2000); for P roperty and

23

Each column in Table 6 presents the results for a separate specification of the panel regression, where
the dependent variables are standardized to mean zero and standard deviation one. Each regression
includes time fixed effects and t-statistics are based on robust standard errors.
The results in Table 6 indicate more of an anomaly (i.e., the risk-adjusted return on LMS financial firms
is more negative) in countries with British legal origin (common law countries), and less in countries with
Scandinavian legal origin. In other words, investors in countries operating under common law perceive a
higher probability of bailout of large financial institutions than those in countries operating under other
legal systems.
At first glance, this result is surprising because La Porta, Lopez-De-Silanes, and Shleifer (2002), for
example, show that governments in countries with French, German, Scandinavian, or socialist legal systems
are more likely to intervene in economic activity than governments in countries with a common law legal
system. When it comes to financial firms, however, the opposite seems to be true – market participants
anticipate that governments in countries with a common law legal system will intervene on behalf of
shareholders of large financial firms more often or to a greater extent than governments in countries with
other kinds of legal systems. Yet, the more negative α for common law countries is consistent with the
notion that common law countries are perceived to offer better protection to shareholders. As a result, in
a bailout, shareholders are less likely to be wiped out.
There is yet another reason why the LMS α can be expected to be higher in common law countries.
Implicit or explicit guarantees of large financial firms, coupled with stock-based compensation plans for
CEOs, may motivate managers to try to increase shareholder wealth, in part by increasing risk. In most
common law countries, stock-based compensation plans are common, and common law systems usually
place little limits on higher pay for CEOs. For example, Gomez-Mejia and Werner (2008) find that there
are few limits on higher pay for CEOs in common law countries because these systems are less prescriptive.
In most other legal systems (especially civil law systems), there are legal limits on CEO compensation.
For example, in both Argentina and the Philippines CEO pay is limited by law. CEO compensation must
also meet an unstated “reasonability” criteria in many other countries including Germany.
Any institutional feature that credibly puts investors of large financial firms at risk of loss would
likely reduce the LMS α. Stern and Feldman (2004) argue that although expectations of bailouts cannot
be eliminated, they can be reduced or better managed through a credible commitment by regulators to
Integrity from the Heritage Foundation; and for Lef t the World Statesman (http:\www.worldstatesman.com).

24

impose losses on investors. They further argue that strong property rights along with other reforms can
help ensure that excessive risk taking does not occur in the financial sector, thereby reducing the need to
bail out financial institutions. These reforms can also help reduce the moral hazard incentives for excessive
risk taking created by the government safety net even if large financial firms are not treated differently
from small financial firms. Consistent with this view, we find that the overpricing of large financial firms
(relative to small financial firms) is less severe in countries with stronger property rights.
Finally, Table 6 also shows a smaller LMS α in countries where government integrity is high and
there is less corruption. This result can be understood if interpreted in light of the classic principal-agent
problem. Regulators are ultimately agents of taxpayers, as any losses on account of bailouts are borne
by taxpayers, but regulators may have incentives that differ from those of taxpayers. That is, regulators
and governments may pursue a too-big-to-fail (TBTF) policy for reason of personal gains (Mishkin (2006)
and Kane (1989, 1991)). In this case, guarantees may be provided to large financial firms not because of
any wider economic benefits, but because failure on a regulator’s watch is too personally important, or
because regulators may accede to implicit industry pressure in order to be in line for favorable privatesector jobs later. If higher government integrity (less corruption) makes such principal-agent violations
between regulators and taxpayers,this should reduce the likelihood of bailouts. This is exactly what the
result in Table 6 suggests.

5.2

Business Environment

Table 7 examines the relation between the size anomaly in financial stock returns and a country’s business
environment. The estimation framework is the same as in Table 6, except that some regressors exhibit
enough within-country variability that allows us to include country fixed effects. The independent variables
are an index that measures the strength of corporate disclosure (Disclose) and an index that measures
the strength of corporate governance (Govern). Higher values of these indices indicate stronger disclosure
and corporate governance requirements.
We include as explanatory variables the number of publicly listed firms in the country (N f irm); an
index that measures the ability of the government to formulate and implement sound business regulations
(Regln); the strength of bankruptcy resolution measured by looking at average recovery rates, time
taken to resolve bankruptcy cases, outcomes, and cost of bankruptcy in a country (Bankrupt); and an
index that measures the extent of economic and political globalization (Global). Higher values in this
25

case indicate a country’s tighter regulation of businesses, stronger bankruptcy mechanisms, and more
globally connected economy. We relate the α to an index that measures the risk of appropriation by the
government (ExpropRisk) in a country. We also include variables that measure the size and importance
of stock markets in a country such as the overall market capitalization of all publicly listed firms in the
country (M ktcap), the average annual volatility of the primary stock market index (StockV ol), and the
average annual return on an index of all publicly traded firms in the country (StockRet).
The results in Table 7 indicate less of a difference in the risk-adjusted return on LMS financial firms
in countries with stronger corporate disclosure and corporate governance requirements, in countries with
tighter business regulations, and in countries that are economically and globally more connected with
other countries. The LMS α is larger (more negative), however, in countries with tighter bankruptcy laws
and when there is a higher risk of government expropriation, and when the stock market is more volatile.
Finally, the size of the LMS α does not seem to be significantly related to either number of publicly listed
firms, overall stock market size, or the average aggregate stock return.
There is a large literature that analyzes the effect of corporate disclosure and governance policies on
the financial outcomes for firms. To the extent that the size anomaly reflects implicit bailout guarantees
in financial disasters, the government essentially subsidizes large financial firms to take on tail risk. Any
external mechanism that counters such risk-taking behavior of financial firms would attenuate the anomaly.
Acharya, Amihud, and Litov (2011) show that stronger disclosure and corporate governance rules are such
mechanisms. They show that firms in countries with strong corporate governance do not take as much
risk as compared to firms in other countries. A negative association between corporate governance and
risk taking is also suggested by Laeven (2002), who shows that financial firms with more concentrated
ownership take more risks than financial firms with diverse ownership.
Thus, the fact the extent of the size anomaly is inversely related to corporate governance is consistent
with the hypothesis that the anomaly is a manifestation of implicit government guarantees. The strength
of general disclosure laws can also affect the incentives of policymakers to engage in providing explicit or
implicit guarantees to TBTF financial firms. If regulators and policymakers know that their involvement
with a bailout of uninsured investors will receive considerable publicity and review, they might be less
willing to provide one.
Stronger supervision and regulation of business and financial firms in particular can reduce the expectations of TBTF coverage. Stronger regulation could also make bailouts less likely if it reduces risks

26

taken and the subsequent losses that the failure of a financial firm imposes on taxpayers. In addition, a
strong regulatory framework, could also reduce risk taking by increasing the market discipline of financial
firms. For these reasons, it is not surprising that the coefficient on Regln is positive and economically
and statistically significant – stronger regulations reduce the incidence of distress and the likelihood of
bailout by regulators.
Table 7 indicates (somewhat surprisingly) that the LMS α is more negative in countries with stronger
creditor rights, as captured by Bankrupt whose coefficient is negative and statistically significant. Ex-ante
one might expect stronger creditor rights to reduce the incentive of financial firms to take on unnecessary
risk (asset-substitution). Yet, Houston, Lin, Lin, and Ma (2010) in a study of 69 countries show that
stronger creditor rights are in fact correlated with higher risk. They find that stronger creditor rights
encourage financial firms to assume more risk, and that unnecessary risk taking significantly increases the
likelihood of financial crisis in the future. If large financial firms require bailout in the event of subsequent
financial crisis, stronger creditor rights should be related to a greater difference in the risk-adjusted returns
of large and small financial firms. This is exactly what we see in Table 7.
The positive coefficient on Global is quite striking. It indicates less of a difference between the riskadjusted performance of large and small financial firms in countries that are more politically and economically connected with other countries. Obstfeld (1998) examines how the extent of globalization impacts
the national policy choices of a government and regulators. He finds that globalization has the beneficial
side-effect of disciplining governments, directing them toward sustainable budgets and price sustainability.
This implies that globalization might exert a similar downward pressure on fiscal profligacy in financial
firms. Thus, globalization (and a measure of openness) of an economy may give regulators and policymakers an incentive to refrain from protection of insolvent financial firms, thus reducing the likelihood of
bailouts.
Table 7 also shows a higher LMS α in countries with a higher risk of expropriation, indicating that
market participants expect shareholders of large financial institutions are more likely to be bailed out in
the event of a financial crisis. This result is a bit puzzling, if the higher risk of expropriation implies that
governments and regulators are more likely to let shareholders of publicly listed firms (and of financial
firms in particular) be wiped out in the event of a financial crisis. That is, if expropriation is associated
with a higher probability that governments and regulators will take private property away from owners
(shareholders) of financial firms, the TBTF guarantees should not be priced in stock returns. On the

27

other hand, if market participants believe that governments and regulators are more likely to intervene
on behalf of shareholders of large financial firms in countries with a higher risk of expropriation, then our
results make sense.
Finally, the coefficient on stock market volatility StockV ol is -4.10 (statistically significant at the 5%
level), indicating that higher volatility (in bad times) is associated with a greater gap in the risk-adjusted
returns of large and small financial firms. Standard neo-classical models (such as Cochrane (2008)) suggest
that improved macroeconomic conditions should be negatively correlated with stock market volatility,
that is, stock market volatility increases in bad times. The model in section 6 above also suggests that
in bad times, as the probability of financial crisis increases, the expected returns gap between size-sorted
portfolios of financial firms widens.

5.3

Financial Environment

Table 8 examines the relation between the size anomaly in financial stock returns and a country’s financial
sector environment. The independent variables are size of the financial sector in a country as measured by
the log of the total number of branches of financial firms (Branches) and the ratio of total financial sector
demand deposits to GDP (Deposits). We also include variables that measure the financial performance
of the financial sector: the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans (N onperf orm); the ratio of
total financial sector liquid assets (e.g., cash, liquid securities) to total book value of assets (Liquidity);
the return on equity of financial firms (P rof it); the ratio of defaulted loans to total loans (Def aults);
and leverage as measured by the total capital-to-assets ratio (Leverage). Variables that measure the
characteristics of the financial sector and the type of consumers that use financial services include the
total depth of public debt markets in a country (BondDepth) and the percentage of financial claims held
by non-residents (F oreign). We include a dummy variable that equals 1 if a country has deposit insurance
and the degree of concentration/competitition in the financial sector as a percentage of total assets held
by the top 3 (T op3) and top 5 largest financial firms (T op5). We also include measures of credit provided
by financial firms to private entities (P vtCredit) and to government-owned entities (GovCredit).
Four key results emerge from the analysis in Table 8. First, there is a greater risk-adjusted difference
between the returns of large and small financial firms, the more dependent a country is on the financial sector, as measured by the number of financial firm branches in the country and the ratio of total
demand deposits-to-GDP. The coefficients on these variables are -11.20 and -6.35, resepectively and are
28

statistically significant at the 10% level or better. This result is consistent with the fact that regulators
and governments are more likely to provide implicit and explicit guarantees to financial firms in countries
where a higher percentage of the population accesses formal financial institutions.
Poor performance of the financial sector increases the likelihood of a financial crisis and makes it more
likely that regulators will likely need to step in to bailout financial institutions that are at the risk of
failure. Indeed, we see that the LMS α increases when the ratio of non-performing loans in a country
increases, when financial firms are liquidity-constrained, when financial firms suffer from low profitability,
or when there is an increase in the percentage of non-performing assets (defaulted loans) held by financial
firms.
Surprisingly, the overall leverage of the financial sector does not affect the likelihood of bailouts as
perceived by the shareholders of large financial firms. The coefficient on Leverage is not statistically
significant and has the wrong sign. An increase in the capital held by financial firms indicates that
bailouts are more likely (i.e., LMS α is more negative). This result is consistent with Jordà, Richter,
Schularick, and Taylor (2017), who show that the amount of capital held by financial firms is not a
significant predictor of financial crisis in the near future.
Third, the size anomaly is lower in countries where bond markets are more developed and where a
higher percentage of claims on financial firms are held by foreigners. In contrast, the LMS α is higher
where the financial sector is more concentrated (and less competitive), as measured by the percentage of
financial sector assets held by the three or five largest financial firms in the country. Surprisingly, the
degree of government ownership of financial firms and the presence (or absence) of deposit insurance does
not seem to be statistically significantly related to the likelihood of bailouts as perceived by shareholders.
The fact that bond market development and foreign ownership of financial firm claims reduce LMS α
is not surprising. If borrowers in a particular country have easy access to public debt markets, they are
less likely to be dependent on financial firms. This in turn makes financial firms less important for an
economy, and regulators more unwilling to expend valuable resources in an attempt to save large financial
firms.
The fact that financial firm concentration increases the size anomaly for financial firms is consistent
with Boyd and De Nicolo (2005), who show that concentrated (less competitive) markets induce financial
firms to assume greater risk. Boyd and De Nicolo (2005) find a positive relation between concentration
and financial firm fragility and thus the probability of systemic distress. Similarly, Caminal and Matutes

29

(2002) show that less competition can lead to less credit rationing, larger loans, and a higher probability of
failure. Concentrated financial systems generally have fewer financial firms and render policymakers more
concerned about financing firm failures than when there are only a few financial firms. Thus, financial
firms in concentrated systems will tend to receive larger subsidies through implicit “too-important-to-fail”
policies that intensify risk-taking incentives and hence increase financial system fragility – this is exactly
what we find in the data.
Finally, the relation between credit to private and government entities and shareholder perception
of implicit guarantees (as measured by the LMS α) is not statistically significant at conventional levels.
Interestingly, the coefficient on P vtCredit is positive and that on GovCredit is negative. Although, the
values are not statistically significant, the direction of the relation suggests that financial firms are more
likely to be bailed out when they have extended a large amount of credit to either the government or
government-owned entities, but not if they are providing credit primarily to private companies.

5.4

Sovereign Environment

In Table 9, we examine the link between the size anomaly in financial stock returns and a country’s
fiscal and sovereign environment. We capture that environment using the amount of fiscal surplus (as a
percentage of GDP) in the country (Surplus); the difference in the yield-to-maturity on the long-term
bond issued by a country and the yield-to-maturity on the long-term bond issued by the U.S. Treasury
(Spread); the ratio of central bank balance sheet assets to GDP (CentBank); the level of inflation
(Inf lation); and the per-capita GDP in the country. The results indicate a greater size (more negative)
in countries with a higher corporate tax rate, a higher ratio of central bank assets-to-GDP, and and a
higher per-capita GDP. These findings confirm that governments in better health are more likely to step
in and bailout large financial firms in the event of a financial crisis.
The positive and statistically significant coefficient on Inf lation in Table 9 also makes sense. Historically, the most severe financial crises are also associated with severe economic contractions. For example,
in the U.S., the financial crises of 1857, 1873, 1893, 1907, and 1930-1933 were all accompanied by severe
economic contractions. This was also true of the recent credit crisis of 2007-2009. Financial crises almost
always involve sharp declines in asset prices and risk of deflation or disinflation. This is precisely when
the risk of failure of large financial firms is high.
Finally, table 9 shows a more negative size anomaly, the higher the value of assets held by a country’s
30

central bank (as a percentage of GDP). Arguably, a well-equipped, well-financed central bank is needed
to provide support to large financial firms in the event of financial crisis, and large financial firms can be
supported only by the balance sheet of central banks.

5.5

Regulatory Environment

Finally, Table 10 relates the size anomaly to the response of regulators and policymakers to past financial
crises, as measured by the severity of a crisis (N P Level); the cost it imposes on regulators and governments (Cost, LiqSupport, N P Level); and various variables capturing their response (SovDebtInc,
M onetaryExp, EntryBarrier, Supervision, P rivatize, Ref orm, and Restrict).
We find a wider risk-adjusted spread between large and small firms when the costs imposed by a
recent financial crisis are high. When the loss of output during a financial crisis is high (Cost) or when
the government provides a large amount of liquidity to financial firms at the peak of the financial crisis
(LiqSupport), the spread between large and small financial firms widens. Similarly, the spread also
widens in an especially severe financial crisis. A substantial increase in the level of non-performing loans
(as a percentage of total financial sector loans) indicates the severity of the financial crisis, increases the
likelihood of bailouts of large financial firms, and thereby widens the risk-adjusted return spread between
large and small financial firms.
Finally, when a financial crisis threatens, regulators and policymakers have two broad approaches
available to them. The first, which we call an accommodative approach, recommends that regulators and
policymakers support financial firms via various regulatory policies such as open-ended liquidity support,
repeated recapitalization, and blanket guarantees to their depositors and creditors. The alternative approach is to restore depositor confidence but to require financial firms to meet standard regulatory rules
(such as capital requirements) or face official intervention that includes bankruptcy resolution mechanisms.
If a particular country has adopted an accommodative approach to financial crises in the past, investors
would anticipate similar intervention in the future as well, and this would be reflected in a greater size
anomaly for financial firms.
Table 10 reports that accommodative regulatory policies strengthen investors’ belief that large financial
firms will be supported in the event of a financial crisis. These beliefs manifest themselves in a wider
average risk-adjusted return spread to LMS. If the government had to issue substantial new sovereign
debt (SovDebtInc), or implement expansionary monetary policies (M onetaryExp), the LMS α widens
31

and becomes more negative.
Tighter restrictions on the financial sector in response to a crisis, however, would reduce the possibility
that the next financial crisis would require outright support to debtholders and equityholders of large
financial firms, and hence diminish the difference in the risk-adjusted returns of large and small financial
firms. This is exactly what we find in the data. If financial sector supervision is tightened, if reforms are
enacted, and if restrictions are placed on financial sector activities in response to a recent financial crisis,
this reduces the likelihood that the next financial crisis would require large transfers from governments
and regulators to prevent liquidation of financial firms, and reduces the LMS α.
As a last point, note that an increase in competition in the financial sector is associated with a
reduction (and not an increase) in the LMS α. When there are more private and public financial firms
in a country (non-government-owned), this is associated with a decline in LMS α by 7.04%, a result that
is statistically significant at the 1% level. This result is inconsistent with the conventional view that
“excessive competition” can lead to socially undesirable outcomes such as failures, financial crisis, runs,
and panics. Instead, this evidence is consistent with Boyd and De Nicolo (2005), who show that a more
competitive financial sector makes financial firms less (and not more) risky.

5.6

Placebo Test

We also carry out a placebo test by running all cross-sectional regressions for non-financials. In almost
all cases, the same variables are not significantly correlated with the non-financial LMS spread. In some
cases, these variables enter significantly with the wrong sign. For example, Disclose and Govern have
opposite signs when the non-financial spread LMS is on the left-hand side. There are some exceptions: the
common law dummy LU K and the Scandinavian law dummy LSC in Table 6; and the liquidity variable and
the concentration variable Conc5 in Table 8 – all enter with the same sign and are statistically significant
when the non-financial spread LMS is on the left-hand-side, but the coefficient on LSC and Conc5 is at
least twice as high for financials. Only the common law dummy LU K (Table 6) and liquidity (Table 8)
enter with the same sign and size.

5.7

Summary

We reiterate that if the size anomaly for financial firms is simply the equivalent of that already documented
for non-financial firms, ex ante, we should not see any connection between the extent of the anomaly and
32

the legal, business, and regulatory framework in a particular country. In untabulated results, we confirm
that these results also hold for just the largest financial firms in a country, and are robust to varying
specifications (such as including a dummy variable for just developed markets). Overall, a country’s
institutional framework captures a substantial fraction of the cross-sectional and time-series variation in
the size anomaly in the financial sector, which is tied to the time-varying probability of implicit or explicit
government guarantees to large (but not small) financial firms in a country.

The Cost of Equity Capital in a Bailout-Augmented Model with
Financial Disaster Risk

We provide a simple model of financial crises and bailouts based on Kelly, Lustig, and Van Nieuwerburgh
(2016). In the model, financial crises are periods of elevated risk of a financial disaster, modeled following
Barro (2006) and Rietz (1988). The critical difference between financial firms and non-financial ones
is their susceptibility to runs during financial crises. Historically, runs have been made by depositors,
but in the modern financial system they are made by other creditors such as investors in asset-backed
commercial paper, repos, and money market mutual funds (see Gorton and Metrick (2009)). This leads
us to take financial disasters as a source of aggregate risk. To model the asset pricing impact of financial
disasters, we use a version of the Rietz (1988); Longstaff and Piazzesi (2004); Barro (2006) asset pricing
model with a time-varying probability of disasters, as developed by Gourio (2008); Gabaix (2012); Wachter
(2013). The model features two sources of priced risk: Gaussian risk and financial disaster (tail) risk. We
model the collective government guarantee as a floor on the aggregate financial company losses that the
government will tolerate in a financial disaster. Through this truncation, the government eliminates part
of the sectorwide tail risk, but it does not eliminate idiosyncratic tail risk. Effectively, the government
provides a subsidy for insurance against the effects of systemic financial disasters. While non-financial
corporations are also subject to the aggregate risk generated by financial disasters, their exposure is more
limited and they do not enjoy the collective bailout guarantee that supports the financial sector.22
We take the bailout-augmented dynamic asset pricing model of Kelly, Lustig, and Van Nieuwerburgh
(2016).

22

Muir (2016) compares the implications of this class of models to data on financial crises, and finds that risk premiums
are not sufficiently responsive prior to these episodes.

We consider a representative agent with Epstein and Zin (1989) preferences over non-durable consumption

Uncertainty

There is a time-varying probability of disaster, pt . This probability follows an I-state Markov chain. Let
Π be the 1 × I steady-state distribution of the Markov chain and P the I × 1 grid with probability states.
The mean disaster probability is ΠP. The Markov chain is uncorrelated with the other consumption and
dividend growth shocks introduced below, although, the volatility of Gaussian consumption and dividend
growth risk potentially varies with the Markov state. This allows us to capture higher Gaussian risk in
bad states associated with high disaster probabilities.
In state i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , I}, the consumption process (∆ct+1 ) is given by a standard Gaussian component
and a disaster risk component:

∆ct+1 = µc + σci ηt+1 ,

if no disaster

∆ct+1 = µc + σci ηt+1 − Jt+1

(5)

where η is a standard normal random variable, and J c is a Poisson mixture of normals governing the size
of the consumption drop (jump) in the disaster state. We adopt the Backus, Chernov, and Martin (2011)
model of consumption disasters. The random variable J c is a Poisson mixture of normal random variable.
34

n

The number of jumps is n with probability e−ω ωn! . Conditional on n, J c is normal with mean (nθc ) and
variance nδc2 . Thus, the parameter ω (jump intensity) reflects the average number of jumps, θc the mean
jump size, and δc the dispersion in jump size. Finally, we allow for heteroscedasticity in the Gaussian
component of consumption growth: σci depends on the Markov state i.23

6.3

Dividends of Individual Firms in the Financial Sector

where ǫt+1 is standard normal and i.i.d. across time. It is the sum of an idiosyncratic and an aggregate

d − λ Ja
component, which we introduce below. The term exp −Jt+1
d t+1 can be thought of as the recovery

rate in case of a disaster event. The loss rate varies across financial firms. It has an idiosyncratic
component J d and a common component J a . The parameter λd governs the exposure of the financial firm
to aggregate tail risk. The cross-sectional mean of λd is 1. The idiosyncratic jump component is a Poisson
mixture of normals that are i.i.d. across time and financial firms, but with common parameters (ω, θd , δd ).
We set θd = 0, which implies that the idiosyncratic jump is truly idiosyncratic; during a disaster the
average jump in any stock’s log dividend growth is equal to the common component −λd E[J a ].

6.4

Collective Bailout Option

The key feature of the model is the presence of the collective government guarantee, which we model as
a ceiling J on the common component of the loss rate of the financial sector. The common component
of the loss rate becomes the minimum of the maximum tolerated sectorwide loss rate J and the actual
realized aggregate loss rate J r :

We model J r as a Poisson mixture of normals with parameters (ω, θr , δr ). For simplicity, we assume
that the jump intensity is perfectly correlated among the three jump processes (J c , J i , J r ), but the jump
23

Note that when J c is activated, we have already conditioned on occurrence of a disaster. Therefore, the parameter ω
is not the disaster frequency but rather the mean of the number of jumps, conditional on a disaster. There is a non-zero
probability e−ω of zero jumps in the disaster state. In what follows we normalize ω to 1.

35

size distributions are independent. We can think of the no-bailout case as J → +∞, so that J a = J r .

The dynamics of hdt are fully determined by the dynamics of pt , which follows a Markov chain. Denote
by hdi the resilience in Markov state i. By using the independence of the three jump processes conditional
on a given number of jumps, we can simplify the last term to:

h̄d = log

The derivation uses proposition 1 below. The last expression, while somewhat complicated, is straight2 2

forward to compute. In the no-bailout case (J → +∞), the last exponential term reduces to en(−λd θr +0.5λd δr ) .
Hence, in the no-bailout case, the resilience is given by:


h̄d = ω exp γθc − θd − λd θr + 0.5(γ 2 δc2 + δθ2 + λ2d δr2 ) − 1
An increase in bailout protection always makes the stock more resilient.
Proposition 1. Consider two stocks i and j with the same exposures to the Gaussian risk factors. The
expected return spread in a non-disaster sample is given by the differences in the resilience of these two
securities:
N D,i
i,N D
j,N D
i,N D
d,i
Et [rt+1
] + (1/2)vart [rt+1
] − Et [rt+1
] − (1/2)vart [rt+1
] = hd,j
t − ht .

37

The proof is in Appendix A. All else equal, an increase in the bailout (smaller J) tends to increase
the resilience of the stock and reduce the expected return in a non-disaster sample. In particular, a large
financial firm stock that benefits from a bailout has negative risk-adjusted returns when benchmarked
against small financial firm stocks that do not benefit directly from the bailout. To see why, fix the
Gaussian and tail risk exposures (ωd , θd , δd ; ωr , θr , δr , λ) for stocks i and j. If j benefits from a bailout but
d,i
i does not, then hd,j
t − ht > 0, and hence i will earn higher risk-adjusted returns in a normal sample.

Any variables that affect the likelihood of a bailout will in turn impact expected excess returns net of
standard risk through its effect on resilience.
An increase in the probability of a disaster reduces the dividend yield on the stock with the greatest
resilience by less. This prediction of the model is confirmed in the data.
Proposition 2. Consider two stocks i and j with the same exposures to the Gaussian risk factors. When
the Markov states are highly persistent, the spread in dividend yields is given approximately by:
pdit − pdjt ≈
where κd1 =

hd,i
t
1 − κ1d,i

−

hd,j
t
1 − κ1d,j

epd
.
1+epd

The proof is in Appendix A. Recall that the dynamics in hdt are completely driven by the probability
of a rare event. The model implies that the spread in dividend yields between large and small financial
firm stocks has predictive power for large drops in the stock market and GDP.24

Conclusion

There is an active debate about forcing banks to carry more equity capital as a buffer against large adverse
shocks to the financial system. If markets are efficient, then bank equity is not an expensive source of
funding, and imposing higher capital requirements does not reduce bank value. Our international evidence
does not support the notion that leverage-constrained investors inflate the share prices of large bank stocks.
Instead, we find evidence that equity has always been a cheap source of funding for the largest banks in
a country. In developed countries, only the largest banks’ stock earns negative risk-adjusted returns, but
24
In Section A.3 of the Appendix, we solve for the equilibrium price of individual and index stock returns. The appendix
derives the equity risk premium. Absent the bailout guarantee, the disaster risk premium would be γλd pi (2 − pi )θc θr , which
is always higher than the equity premium in the presence of a guarantee. Thus, the government guarantee reduces the cost
of capital to financial firms.

38

in emerging market countries, other large nonbank financial firms do. The large-minus-small, financialminus-non-financial, risk-adjusted spread varies across countries in ways that are consistent with the idea
that stock investors price in the implicit government guarantees that protect shareholders of the largest
banks in developed countries.

Figure 2. Risk-adjusted returns for size-sorted portfolios of financial firms vs non-financial firms
This figure presents the risk-adjusted returns of size-sorted portfolios of financial firms vs non-financial firms by country. In each month, for each country, we sort financial firms
and non-financial firms, separately, into 10 portfolios by market capitalization. All returns are denominated in local currency for each country. The black solid line presents the
cross-sectional average risk-adjusted return and the red dashed line presents the cross-sectional median risk-adjusted return for the LMS portfolio. For each country, the longest
available sample ending December 31, 2013 is selected.

Table 1. Summary statistics.
Notes: Panel A presents summary statistics for the financial firms in our sample, by country. We report the number of distinct financial
firms (N ); the percentage of all publicly listed firms classified as financial firms (%N ), and the average market capitalization of financial
firms as a percentage of total market capitalization of all publicly listed firms (%M Cap) in each country. Year indicates the starting
year for the country in our sample. Panel B shows the summary statistics for size-sorted portfolios of financial firms. In each month, for
each country, we sort financial firms into 10 portfolios by market capitalization. Large and small denote the portfolios of firms with the
highest and lowest market capitalization, respectively. LMS denotes the monthly return of large minus small. We report the number
of distinct financial firms (N ); the average market capitalization as a percentage of the market capitalization of the entire financial
intermediary sector (%F Cap); the turnover rate – computed as the probability (in %) that a firm migrates to another portfolio in the
subsequent month (%T urn); the average value-weighted monthly return (Ret); and its t-statistic based on standard errors clustered by
time and country. All returns are denominated in local currency. Statistical significance is indicated by ∗ , ∗∗ , and ∗∗∗ at the 10%, 5%,
and 1% levels, respectively. For each country, the longest available sample ending December 31, 2013 is selected.

Table 2. Risk-adjusted returns for size-sorted portfolios of financial firms and non-financial firms.
Notes: This table presents estimates from pooled OLS regression of monthly excess returns of size-sorted portfolios on equity risk
factors. All returns and risk factors are expressed in local currency. In each month, for each country, we sort financial firms and
non-financial firms separately into 10 size-sorted portfolios by market capitalization. Large and small denote the portfolios of firms with
the highest and lowest market capitalization, respectively. We regress excess returns to large, small, and their difference, denoted LMS,
using Fama and French (1993) risk factors. The table displays the estimates for risk-adjusted return (α) and its t-statistic based on
standard errors clustered by time and country. Columns titled Fin refer to financial firms, columns titled Non-fin refer to non-financial
firms, and columns titled Fin Minus Non-fin refer to their difference. Statistical significance is indicated by ∗ , ∗∗ , and ∗∗∗ at the 10%,
5%, and 1% levels, respectively. Coefficients are annualized, multiplied by 100, and expressed in percentages. For each country, the
longest available sample ending December 31, 2013 is selected.

Table 3. Risk-adjusted returns for size-sorted portfolio of largest financial firms by type.
Notes: This table presents the estimates from the pooled OLS regression of monthly excess returns of size-sorted portfolios of financial
firms on standard stock risk factors for data. All returns and risk factors expressed in local currency. In each month, for each country,
we sort financial firms into 10 size-sorted portfolios by market capitalization. Large denotes the portfolio of firms with the highest
market capitalization. We regress excess returns to large on the Fama and French (1993) risk factors. The table displays the estimates
for the risk-adjusted return (α) and its t-statistic based on standard errors clustered by time and country. The first two columns report
the results for the longest available sample for each country, the next two columns report the results over 1990-2013, and the last two
columns report the results over 2000-2013. The large portfolio is split into Banks & Financial Services, Insurance, and RE Investment
firms. Results are reported when pooling across countries (Panel A), across developed markets only (Panel B), and across emerging
markets only (Panel C). Statistical significance is indicated by ∗ , ∗∗ , and ∗∗∗ at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively. Coefficients
are annualized, multiplied by 100, and expressed in percentages. For each country, the longest available sample ending December 31,
2013 is selected.

Table 4. Forecasting regressions for the aggregate stock market and gross domestic product.
Notes: This table presents the estimates from a pooled conditional fixed-effect Logit regression. The dependent variable is a dummy
variable that takes a value of 1 when the country H-month ahead growth rate of gross domestic product (for Panel A) or the H-month
ahead return on the aggregate stock market index (for Panel B) is below its 10th -percentile, with H = {3, 6, 9, 12}. In each month, for
each country, we sort financial firms into 10 size-sorted portfolios by market capitalization. Large and small denote the portfolios of
firms with the highest and lowest market capitalization, respectively. The independent variable is the monthly value-weighted dividend
yield of large over small financial firms, denoted by DYLM S . In each panel, the first row reports the loading on the DYLM S portfolio,
and the second row reports its corresponding t-statistic. The last row indicates the change in the odds of a drop in the H-period ahead
return of the aggregate stock index or gross domestic product growth rates below its 10th -percentile for a 1-standard deviation increase
in the monthly return to LMS. Statistical significance is indicated by ∗ , ∗∗ , and ∗∗∗ at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively. For
each country, the longest available sample ending December 31, 2013 is selected.

Table 5. Performance of the LMS portfolio for financial firms during economic crisis.
Notes: This table shows the value of $100 invested in a portfolio that goes long in large financial firms and short in small financial firms
during economic crisis. In each country, an economic crisis is defined as quarters in which the GDP is below the 10th −percentile level
for that country. In each month, for each country, we sort financial firms and non-financial firms separately into 10 size-sorted portfolios
by market capitalization. Large and small refer to firms with the highest and lowest market capitalization, respectively. LMS is the
monthly excess return of large over small firms. In each country, $100 is invested in this portfolio at the start of the crisis. The column
labeled Value represents the risk-adjusted return on this portfolio at the end of the crisis. The columns labeled Delistings represents
the average number of financial firms classified as small at the start of the crisis that delist per month during the crisis in excess of the
number of firms that are in the large portfolio at the start of the crisis that delist per month during the crisis. The number of delisted
firms is expressed as a percentage of firms in the small and large portfolio at the start of the crisis, respectively.

Table 6. Legal environment and the size anomaly for financial firms.
Notes: This table reports the results for a panel regression of the risk-adjusted return to the LMS portfolio of financial firms on variables
capturing a country’s legal environment. In each month, for each country, we sort financial firms and non-financial firms separately
into 10 size-sorted portfolios by market capitalization. Large and small denote portfolios of firms with the highest and lowest market
capitalization, respectively. We regress the difference in the return to large minus small, denoted LMS, on the Fama and French (1993)
risk factors over 2-year non-overlapping windows. The dependent variable is the estimated risk-adjusted return on LMS for country j.
The regressors are: a dummy variable that equals 1 if country j follows UK law (LU K ); a dummy variable that equals 1 if country
j follows French law (LF R ); a dummy variable that equals 1 if country j follows German law (LGR ); a dummy variable that equals
1 if country j follows Scandinavian law (LSC ); an index measuring property rights in a country (P roperty); an index measuring how
left-leaning the Federal government is in a country (Lef t); and an index measuring the perception of integrity of the government in
a country (Integrity). Data for legal systems come from La Porta, Lopez-de Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (2000); for P roperty and
Integrity from the Heritage foundation; for Lef t from the World Statesman (http:\www.worldstatesman.com). Each column reports
the results for a separate panel regression specification. In parentheses, we report robust t-statistics. Statistical significance is indicated
by *, **, and *** at the 10%, 5% and 1% levels, respectively. For each country, the longest available sample ending December 31, 2013
is selected. The regressors are standardized to mean zero and variance one. TFE denotes time fixed effects.

Notes: This table reports the results for the panel regression of the risk-adjusted return to the LMS portfolio of financial firms on
variables capturing a country’s sovereign environment. In each month, for each country, we sort financial firms and non-financial firms
separately into 10 size-sorted portfolios by market capitalization. Large and small denote portfolios of firms with the highest and
lowest market capitalization, respectively. We regress the difference in the return to large minus small, denoted LMS, on the Fama
and French (1993) risk factors over 2-year non-overlapping windows. The dependent variable is the estimated risk-adjusted return
on LMS for country j. The regressors are: the fiscal surplus (as a percentage of GDP) in the country (Surplus); the difference in
the yield-to-maturity on the long-term bond issued by a country and the yield-to-maturity on the long-term bond issued by the U.S.
Treasury (Spread); the ratio of central bank assets to GDP (CentBank); the value of the index of inflation at year end (Inf lation);
and the per-capita GDP (GDP ) in the country. Data is from Global Economic data (http:\www.globaleconomy.com), International
Financial Statistics, International Monetary Fund, and World Development Indicators – World Bank. Each column reports the results

Table 10. Regulatory environment and the size anomaly for financial firms.
Notes: This table reports the results for the panel regression of the risk-adjusted return to the LMS portfolio of financial firms on
variables capturing a country’s sovereign environment. In each month, for each country, we sort financial firms and non-financial firms
separately into 10 size-sorted portfolios by market capitalization. Large and small denote portfolios of firms with the highest and lowest
market capitalization, respectively. We regress the difference in the return to large minus small, denoted LMS, on the Fama and French
(1993) risk factors over 2-year non-overlapping windows, t + 1 to t + 2. The dependent variable is the estimated risk-adjusted return on
LMS for country j. The regressors are: the cost of each financial crisis as a percentage of GDP (Cost); the amount of liquidity support
provided to financial firms as a percentage of GDP (LiqSupport); the level of non-performing loans (N P Levels); the increase in sovereign
debt to support financial firms (SovDebtInc); a dummy variable that equals 1 if monetary expansion was undertaken in response to crisis
(M onetaryExp); a dummy variable that equals 1 if entry restrictions were placed on the financial sector (EntryBarrier); a dummy that
equals 1 if financial supervision was tightened (Supervision); the number of private and public (i.e. non-government owned) financial
firms (P rivatize); a dummy variable that equals 1 if reforms were enacted (Ref orm) and if restrictions were placed on financial firms
(Restrict) after each financial crisis. Data is from Laeven and Valencia (2008). Each column reports the results for a separate panel
regression specification. In parentheses, we report robust t-statistics. Statistical significance is indicated by *, **, and *** at the 10%,

Valuing the Consumption Claim

We start by valuing the consumption claim. Consider the investor’s Euler equation for the consumption claim Et [Mt+1 Ra

can be decomposed as:

where N D (D) denotes the Gaussian (disaster) component of consumption growth, dividend growth or returns. We define “resilience”
for the consumption claim as:


Htc = 1 + pt Et exp (γ − 1)Jt+1

We log-linearize the total wealth return Ra

follows: ra,t+1 = κc0 + wct+1 − κc1 wct + ∆ct+1 with linearization constants:
ewc



− log ewc − 1 + κc1 wc.
ewc

(28)
(29)

The wealth-consumption ratio differs across Markov states. Let wci be the log wealth-consumption ratio in Markov state i. The mean
log wealth-consumption ratio can be computed using the stationary distribution:

wc =

Πi wci

(30)

where Πi is the ith element of vector Π. Note that the linearization constants κc0 and κc1 depend on wc. Using the log linearization for
the total wealth return, the Euler equation can be restated as follows:

where we use the cumulant-generating function to compute h̄c . It is now clear that resilience varies only with the probability of a
disaster pt . Therefore, it too is a Markov chain. Denote by hci the log resilience in Markov state i. Solving the Euler equation for the
consumption claim amounts to solving for the log wealth-consumption ratio in each state i. We obtain the system of I equations as
follows, which can be solved for wci , i = 1, . . . I:

where πij is the transition probability between states i and j. Taking logs on both sides we get a system of equations that can be solved
in conjunction with (28), (29), and (30):

We are interested in computing the variance of dividend growth rates, the variance of returns, and the covariance between a pair of
returns. This will allow us to compute the volatility of returns and the correlation of returns.
Applying Lemma 4 below to the J a process and conditioning on n jumps, we get that

Similarly, mean dividend growth is given by E[∆di ] = µd − pi (θd + λd θa ). If θd = 0, as we assume, mean dividend growth is simply
µd − pi λd θa .
The variance of returns can be derived similarly, with the only added complication that we need to take into account state transitions
from i to j that affect the mean return µrij .

Thomson Reuters Business Classification

Thomson Reuters (TR) has developed a market-based business classification system for firms. The system classifies more than 72,000
firms, spread across 130 countries, into one of 837 business activities or 136 different industries. The TR business classification system
is widely used. More than 8,000 different indices use the TR business classification system for benchmarking, index computation, and
ETF construction.
To classify firms, TR looks at the markets a firm serves. This system is used to classify firms as a whole. If a firm has different
business segments, then the business activity of the dominant segment determines the firm’s classification. Dominant business segments
are identified using revenue, assets, or operating profit thresholds. TR regularly reviews and revises its business classification system
to ensure that the business classification assignment for a particular firm remains valid. In this process, over 60,000 firms are reviewed
every year.
Further details regarding the business classification system can be obtained from http://financial.thomsonreuters.com/en/
products/data-analytics/market-data/indices/trbc-indices.html

Additional Results

In this section, we present additional results and robustness tests.

Results by country: Table A1 and the Figure report the risk-adjusted returns of the Large-minus-Small (LMS) portfolio of
financial firms by country. In the Figure, the black solid line presents the cross-sectional average risk-adjusted return and the red line
plots the cross-sectional median risk-adjusted return for the LMS portfolio. The risk-adjusted returns are annualized and expressed in
percentage.
Banks and financial services firms:

Table A2 reports the risk-adjusted returns for the size-sorted portfolios of banks
and financial services firms in each country. The table shows the risk-adjusted return for the top and bottom deciles of banks and
financial services firms as well as the results separately for emerging and developed markets. Table A3 shows the risk-adjusted returns
for the top three commercial banks in each country.

Size effect in financial stock returns:

Table A4 compares the performance of large and small financial firms with
similar loadings on standard risk factors. For each country, for each financial intermediary in our sample, we estimate loadings on the
three Fama-French factors in a given month. For any month, the loadings on the standard risk factors are estimated using data for the
prior 12 months. We roll the regression one month at a time to obtain a time series of factor loadings for each financial intermediary in
each country in our sample. Next, in each month, for each country, we sort all financial firms into 10 portfolios by loadings on the SMB
factor. At this time, we also compute the firm Z-score as Z = std(βMarket ) + std(βHML ), where std denotes cross-sectional standardization,
for each financial intermediary. Next, in each month, we match a financial firm in the large portfolio to the financial firm in the small
portfolio in the same SMB decile and with the closest Z-score possible. We form value-weighted returns for all financial firms in the large
portfolio and in the small portfolio of matched firms. When there are no small firms in a given SMB decile, we assign the risk-free rate.
At the end of this exercise, we have monthly value-weighted returns for large and small portfolios of financial firms that differ by market
capitalization but have similar loadings on the Fama-French size factor, SMB.

Comparison with non-financial firms:

Table A5 compares size-sorted portfolio of financial and non-financial firms.
Panel A of the table analyzes the relative performance of financial and non-financial firms over different subsamples. Panel B of Table
A5 reports the results when financial and non-financial firms are sorted into portfolios using the same decile breakpoints. Finally, Panel
C of Table A5 presents the results of financial and non-financial firms sorted by book value of assets. Finally, Table A6 runs a standard
characteristics regressions separately for financial firms, banks, and non-financial firms for all countries in our sample.

Results after adjusting for delisting: Table A7 shows the risk-adjusted returns for the size-sorted portfolios of financial
and non-financial firms after adjusting for delisting returns. To identify delisted firms in TRD, we use the fact that even after a firm
delists, TRD continues to report its monthly total equity return and market capitalization as a stale value that does not vary. We then
impute a -100% return to the stock return of all delisted firms so identified. The imputation of a -100% to all delisted firms is equivalent
to assuming that all delistings are on account of financial distress or bankruptcy. Finally, we use the data, adjusted for delisting returns,
to form the size-sorted portfolios (separately) for financial and non-financial firms in each country.
8

Alternative portfolio formation schemes:

Table A8 shows the risk-adjusted returns for the size-sorted portfolios
of financial and non-financial firms after using alternative portfolio formation schemes. In our baseline results we winsorize raw data
for stock returns from TRD at the 5th and 95th percentile to remove problematic outliers. There is a chance that winsorization at
these levels may exclude a lot of valid return observations which could substantially impact the results. Therefore, in Panel A of Table
A8 we rerun the baseline regression for data pooled across all countries after winsorization at the 0.1th and 99.99th percentile levels.
Reinganum (1983) shows that small firms experience large returns in Janary and exceptionally large returns during the first few trading
days in January. To ensure that the January effect does not drive the fact that large financial firms underperform small financial firms,
in Panel B we present the risk-adjusted returns for data pooled across all countries but after excluding all returns for January in each
year over our sample period. Finally, in Panel C we confirm that our analysis is unaffected by the use of either value-weighted or
equal-weighted portfolio returns.

Sub sample analysis, USD Returns, Additional risk factors, Largest financial firms: Panel A of
Table A9 reports the average risk adjusted returns computed using the three-factor Fama-French model over different subsamples. The
first two columns report the estimates for the longest available sample for each country. The next two columns restrict to the 1990-2013
sample, while the last two columns restrict to the 2000-2013 sample. Panel B of Table A9 shows the results for returns denominated in
U.S. Dollars. When we analyze returns denominated in U.S. Dollars, we use the U.S., the Regional, or the Global Fama-French factors.
The U.S. factors are from the model of Fama and French (1993). We also use data for regional Fama-French factors available from
Kenneth French’s website. The regional factors are available for 4 regions namely, Asia, Japan, Europe, and North America. We apply
the corresponding regional factors when we analyze returns denominated in U.S. Dollars for countries located in each of the 4 regions
above. Finally, we also use the Global Fama-French factors, data for which is also available from Kenneth French’s website. Panel C
of Table A9 includes additional risk factors. In addition to the three Fama-French factors, we also include the “Betting against Beta”
(BAB) factor from Frazzini and Pedersen (2014), a co-skewness factor from Harvey and Siddique (2000), and the idiosyncratic volatility
factor of Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2009). We follow the procedure in Harvey and Siddique to construct the traded co-skewness
factor for each country in our sample. Finally, we construct and control for a volatility factor defined as the return to a portfolio that
goes long in stocks of financial firms in the bottom decile of idiosyncratic volatility and short in the stocks of financial firms in the
top decile of idiosyncratic volatility. Panel D of Table A9 reports the results for the top n financial firms in each country. Each row
corresponds to a distinct value of n being 3, 5, or 10, respectively.
Total subsidy to the cost of capital of large financial firms: Table A10 reports the average of this normalized
quantity across different groups and time periods. Panel A contains estimates averaged across all countries. In Panel B, we report averages
separately for developed and emerging markets. Finally, Panel C collects averages when grouping countries by geographical region.

Figure A1. Risk-adjusted returns for size-sorted portfolios of financial firms by country.
This figure presents the risk-adjusted returns of size-sorted portfolios of financial firms by country. In each month, for each country, we sort financial firms into 10 portfolios by
market capitalization. Large and small denote the portfolios of firms with the highest and lowest market capitalization, respectively. The figure plots LMS, i.e., the annualized
risk-adjusted return of large over small financial firms. All returns are denominated in local currency for each country. The black solid line presents the cross-sectional average
risk-adjusted return and the red dashed line presents the cross-sectional median risk-adjusted return for the LMS portfolio. For each country, the longest available sample ending
December 31, 2013 is selected.

Table A1. Risk-adjusted returns for size-sorted portfolios of financial firms and non-financial firms by
country.
Notes: This table presents the estimates from the pooled OLS regression of monthly excess returns of size-sorted portfolios on equity
risk factors. All returns and risk factors are expressed in local currency. In each month, for each country, we sort financial firms and
non-financial firms separately into 10 size-sorted portfolios by market capitalization. Large and small denote the portfolios of firms with
the highest and lowest market capitalization, respectively. We regress excess returns to large, small, and their difference, denoted LMS,
on the Fama and French (1993) risk factors. The table displays the estimates for risk-adjusted return (α) and its t-statistic based on
standard errors clustered by time and country. Columns titled Fin refer to financial firms, columns titled Non-fin refer to non-financial
firms, and columns titled Fin Minus Non-fin refer to their difference. Statistical significance is indicated by ∗ , ∗∗ , and ∗∗∗ at the 10%,
5%, and 1% levels, respectively. Coefficients are annualized, multiplied by 100, and expressed in percentages. For each country, the
longest available sample ending December 31, 2013 is selected.

small minus big, and high minus low, respectively. Statistical significance is indicated by ∗ , ∗∗ , and ∗∗∗ at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels,
respectively. Coefficients are annualized and multiplied by 100 and expressed in percentages. For the pooled regressions, standard errors
are clustered by time and country. For each country, the longest available sample ending December 31, 2013 is selected.

Table A4. Risk-adjusted returns for size-sorted portfolios of financial firms matched by risk-factor
loadings.
Notes: This table presents the estimates from the pooled OLS regression of monthly excess returns of size-sorted portfolios of financial
firms on equity risk factors. All returns and risk factors expressed in local currency. In each month, for each country, we sort financial
firms into 10 size-sorted portfolios by market capitalization. Large and small denote the portfolios of firms with the highest and lowest
market capitalization, respectively. We regress excess returns to large, small, and their difference, denoted LMS, on the Fama and
French (1993) risk factors. The table displays the estimates for risk-adjusted returns (α) and its t-statistic based on standard errors
clustered by time and country. The first two columns report the results for the longest available sample for each country, the next two
columns report the results over 1990-2013, and the last two columns report the results over 2000-2013. In Panel A, large financial firms
are matched to small financial firms in the same SMB decile. In Panel B, large financial firms are matched to small financial firms in the
same Market decile. In Panel C, large financial firms are matched to small financial firms with closest Idiosyncratic Volatility. Statistical
significance is indicated by ∗ , ∗∗ , and ∗∗∗ at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively. Coefficients are annualized, multiplied by 100,
and expressed in percentages. For each country, the longest available sample ending December 31, 2013 is selected.

Table A5. Risk-adjusted returns for size-sorted portfolios of financial firms and non-financial firms,
alternative sorting.
Notes: This table presents the estimates from the pooled OLS regression of monthly excess returns of size-sorted portfolios on equity
risk factors. All returns and risk factors are expressed in local currency. In each month, for each country, we sort financial firms and
non-financial firms separately into 10 size-sorted portfolios by market capitalization. Large and small denote the portfolios of firms with
the highest and lowest market capitalization, respectively. We regress excess returns to large, small, and their difference, denoted LMS,
on the Fama and French (1993) risk factors. The table displays the estimates for risk-adjusted returns (α) and its t-statistic based on
standard errors clustered by time and country for the LMS and large portfolios for the group of Fin, Non-Fin, and their difference.
The first two columns report the results for the longest available sample for each country, the next two columns report the results over
1990-2013, and the last two columns report the results over 2000-2013. In Panel A, decile breakpoints are specific to each group of firms
(i.e. financial and non-financial firms). In Panel B, decile breakpoints are the same across the two groups. In Panel C, decile breakpoints
are based on book value. Statistical significance is indicated by ∗ , ∗∗ , and ∗∗∗ at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively. Coefficients
are annualized, multiplied by 100, and expressed in percentages. For each country, the longest available sample ending December 31,

Table A7. Adjusted for delisting returns.
Notes: This table presents the estimates from the OLS regression of monthly excess returns of size-sorted portfolios on equity risk
factors. All returns and risk factors are expressed in local currency. In each month, for each country, we sort financial firms and
non-financial firms separately into 10 size-sorted portfolios by market capitalization. Large and small denote the portfolios of firms with
the highest and lowest market capitalization, respectively. In all cases, we adjust for delisting returns by imputing a return of -100% for
all firms that delist during our sample for whatever reason. We regress excess returns to large, small, and their difference, denoted LMS,
on the Fama and French (1993) risk factors. Columns titled Fin refer to financial firms, columns titled Non-fin refer to non-financial
firms, and columns titled Fin Minus Non-fin refer to their difference. In Panel A, we report the estimates for risk-adjusted return (α)
for LMS and its t-statistic for each country. In Panel B, results are reported when pooling across all countries, across developed markets
only, and across emerging markets only. For pooled data, t-statistic based on standard errors clustered by time and country. Statistical
significance is indicated by ∗ , ∗∗ , and ∗∗∗ at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively. Coefficients are annualized, multiplied by 100,

Table A9. Robustness tests.
Notes: This table presents the estimates from the pooled OLS regression of monthly excess returns of size-sorted portfolios of financial
firms on equity risk factors. All returns and risk factors expressed in local currency. In each month, for each country, we sort financial
firms into 10 size-sorted portfolios by market capitalization. Large and small denote the portfolios of firms with the highest and lowest
market capitalization, respectively. We regress excess returns to large, small, and their difference, denoted LMS, on the Fama and French
(1993) risk factors. The table displays the estimates for risk-adjusted return (α) and its t-statistic based on standard errors clustered by
time and country. The first two columns report the results for the longest available sample for each country, the next two columns report
the results over 1990-2013, and the last two columns report the results over 2000-2013. Panel A reports the results for the baseline
model. In Panel B returns and risk factors expressed in USD and the risk factors are either the US, or Regional, or Global Fama-French
factors. In Panel C, returns and risk factors are expressed in local currency, and the risk factors are the standard Fama and French
(1993) factors augmented by either the “Betting against Beta” factor from Frazzini and Pedersen (2014), the co-skewness factor from
Harvey and Siddique (2000), and a Volatility factor that goes long financial firms in the bottom decile of idiosyncratic volatility and
short financial firms in the top decile of idiosyncratic volatility, or all three together. In Panel D, the large portfolio is constructed using

Table A10. Total subsidy to the cost of capital for large financial firms
Notes: This table presents the estimates for the total subsidy to the cost of capital for Large financial firms. In each month, for each
country, we sort financial firms into 10 size-sorted portfolios by market capitalization. Large and small denote the portfolios of firms
with the highest and lowest market capitalization, respectively. We regress the difference in the return to large minus small, denoted
LMS, on the Fama and French (1993) risk factors separately for each country. The risk-adjusted return (α) from this regression is
multiplied by the average market capitalization of firms in the large portfolio and is normalized by the gross domestic product of the
country as of December 2013. The first column reports the results for the longest available sample for each country. The next column
reports the results over 1990-2013, and the last column reports the results over 2000-2013. Panel A reports the average subsidy across
all countries. Panel B reports the average subsidy for developed and emerging markets. Panel C reports the average subsidy across
geographic regions. For each country, the longest available sample ending December 31, 2013 is selected.
