Estimating Cross-Industry Cross-Country Interaction Models Using Benchmark Industry Characteristics
Antonio Ciccone and Elias Papaioannou
NBER Working Paper No. 22368
June 2016
JEL No. F10,G30,O40
ABSTRACT
Empirical cross-industry cross-country models are applied widely in economics, for example to
investigate the determinants of economic growth or international trade. Estimation generally
relies on US proxies for unobservable technological industry characteristics, for example
industries' dependence on external finance or relationship-specific inputs. We examine the
properties of the estimator and find that estimates can be biased towards zero (attenuated) or
away from zero (amplified), depending on how technological similarity with the US covaries
with other country characteristics. We also develop an alternative estimator that yields a lower
bound on the true effect in cross-industry cross-country models of comparative advantage.

Introduction

Recent empirical work in macroeconomics and international trade has relied extensively on
cross-industry cross-country models that relate cross-country di¤erences in industry performance – industry growth or industry exports for example – to an interaction between (i)
country characteristics like …nancial development, institutional quality, or human capital endowments and (ii) industry characteristics like external-…nance dependence, the complexity
of production, or skill intensity. The approach has proven useful for examining a surprisingly wide variety of interesting economic questions, brie‡y reviewed below. Two strands of
research stand out. First, following Rajan and Zingales (1998), cross-industry cross-country
models have been used to examine how economic growth and development is a¤ected by
…nancial development, property rights protection, contract enforcement, and human capital
endowments. Second, building on Romalis (2004) and subsequent theoretical contributions
in international trade, cross-industry cross-country models have served as the basis for empirical studies of the e¤ect of factor endowments and institutions on comparative advantage
(for a review, see Nunn and Tre‡er, 2014). For example, Nunn (2007) uses the approach
to show that better contract enforcement is a source of comparative advantage in industries
that use relationship-speci…c inputs more intensively.
Because there is little industry data for most countries, the cross-industry cross-country
literature generally treats the relevant technological industry characteristics –for example,
external-…nance dependence in Rajan and Zingales (1998) or relationship-speci…c input intensity in Nunn (2007) – as unobservable and employs proxies from a benchmark country,
typically the United States (US). Another reason for using US industry data to obtain proxies for the relevant industry characteristics is that technological industry characteristics must
be inferred from industry behavior, which is likely to yield more reliable results in countries
where markets are not too distorted. Our goal here is to understand the widely used crossindustry cross-country estimator and formally analyze the implications of using data from a
benchmark country to proxy unobservable technological industry characteristics.
Our starting point is an empirical framework that encompasses the cross-industry crosscountry models in the literature. A basic feature of the framework is that the technological
characteristics of industries may be more similar for some pairs of countries than others
(e.g., Bernard and Jones, 1996; Acemoglu and Zilibotti, 2001; Schott, 2004; Caselli, 2005).
We then show that the benchmarking estimator used in the cross-industry cross-country
literature is subject to a bias shaped by two countervailing forces. Unsurprisingly, proxying
the technological industry characteristics of countries using data from a benchmark country

1

may result in a bias toward zero (an attenuation bias). The reasoning is similar to that of
the classical measurement error bias. But benchmarking may also result in a bias away from
zero, which we refer to as ampli…cation bias. The ampli…cation bias can be very strong if
technologically similar countries are similar in other dimensions.1
A main area of application of cross-industry cross-country models is international trade,
where these models have been used to examine the e¤ect of factor endowments and institutions on comparative advantage (e.g. Romalis, 2004; Levchenko, 2007; Nunn, 2007; Cuñat
and Melitz, 2012; Krishna and Levchenko, 2013; Manova, 2013). We show that in this
context there is a benchmarking estimator that is biased towards zero and therefore yields
a lower bound on the true e¤ect, as long as some countries di¤er in the direction of their
comparative advantage. We illustrate this estimator by applying it to Nunn’s (2007) study
of the e¤ect of contract enforcement on comparative advantage in industries that depend
more on relationship-speci…c intermediate inputs.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Next we brie‡y review some of the applications of the cross-industry cross-country approach. Section 2 examines the estimator used in
the cross-industry cross-country literature. Section 3 develops the alternative estimator that
yields a lower bound on the true e¤ect in models of comparative advantage and illustrates
the estimator in the context of Nunn (2007). Section 4 concludes.
Some Applications of the Cross-Industry Cross-Country Approach The crossindustry cross-country approach is widely used in economics and our brief review here is
only meant to illustrate the range of empirical applications. See Appendix Table 1 for a
summary of the variety of applications.
Many applications of the cross-industry cross-country approach investigate the e¤ects
of …nancial markets on economic growth, …rm entry and exit, investment, and innovation
(e.g., Rajan and Zingales, 1998; Fisman and Love, 2003, 2007; Braun and Larrain, 2005;
Aghion, Fally, and Scarpetta, 2007; Beck, Demirgüc-Kunt, Laeven, and Levine, 2008; Brown,
Martinson, and Petersen, 2013; Hsu, Tian, and Xu, 2014; Calomiris, Larrain, Liberti, and
Sturgess, 2016).
The cross-industry cross-country approach has been widely used to examine the determinants of international trade and industrial specialization. Nunn (2007), Levchenko (2007),
and subsequent works show that institutionally advanced countries tend to specialize in sec1

It is tempting to think of the ampli…cation bias as a simple omitted variable bias, but there are di¤erences
that make this analogy less useful. For example, the two forces determining the bias of the benchmarking
estimator result in either ampli…cation or attenuation. In contrast, the simple omitted variable bias is either
upwards or downwards. Nevertheless, the bias of the benchmarking estimator can – just like the classical
measurement error bias –be understood as a nonstandard omitted variable bias.

tors that rely on di¤erentiated intermediate inputs (see also Ranjan and Lee, 2007; Ferguson
and Formai, 2013; Nunn and Tre‡er, 2014). Manova (2008, 2013) links …nancial development to the patterns of international trade (see also Chan and Manova, 2015; Manova,
Wei, and Zhang, 2015). Building on Romalis (2004), Ciccone and Papaioannou (2009) show
that countries with an educated workforce tend to specialize in human capital intensive sectors. The cross-industry cross-country approach has also been used to investigate the e¤ect
of product and labor market institutions on comparative advantage, productivity, entrepreneurship, and innovation (e.g., Ciccone and Papaioannou, 2007; Cingano, Leonardi, Messina,
and Pica, 2010; Cuñat and Melitz, 2012; Tang, 2012; Gri¢ th and Macartney, 2014). And
recent works have employed the cross-industry cross-country approach to study the e¤ects of
environmental protection laws and water supply on comparative advantage (Broner, Bustos,
and Carvalho, 2015; Debaere, 2015).
Other applications of the cross-industry cross-country approach investigate a variety of
di¤erent economic issues. For example, the driving forces of outsourcing, foreign direct investment, and the fragmentation of production (e.g., Alfaro and Charlton, 2009; Carluccio
and Fally, 2012; Basco, 2013; Blyde and Danielken, 2015; Paunov, 2016). The cross-industry
cross-country approach has also been used to examine the economic consequences of crosscountry di¤erences in …rm size distributions, entry regulation, transaction costs, risk sharing possibilities, skill dispersion, and foreign aid in‡ows (e.g. Pagano and Schivardi, 2003;
Klapper, Laeven, and Rajan, 2006; Acemoglu, Johnson, and Mitton, 2009; Rajan and Subramanian, 2010; Aizenman and Sushko, 2011; Bombardini, Gallipoli, and Pupato, 2012;
Michelacci and Schivardi, 2013; Larrain, 2014; Aghion, Howitt, and Prantl, 2014). Recent
applications use the cross-industry cross-country setup to assess the e¤ects of …nancial crises
on macroeconomic performance and international trade (e.g. Dell’Ariccia, Detragiache, and
Rajan, 2008; Iacovone and Zavacka, 2009; Duchin, Ozbas, and Sensoy, 2010; Claessens, Tong,
and Wei, 2012; Laeven and Valencia, 2013) and to examine the e¤ects of …scal and monetary
policy over the business cycle (e.g. Aghion, Farhi, and Kharroubi, 2013; Aghion, Hemous,
and Kharroubi, 2014).
Variations of the cross-industry cross-country approach have been employed to examine the economic e¤ects of di¤erences in …nancial development, institutional quality and
trust across regions and over time (e.g. Cetorelli and Strahan, 2006; Bertrand, Schoar,
and Tesmar, 2007; Hsieh and Parker, 2007; Aghion, Askenazy, Berman, Cette, and Eymar,
2012; Fafchamps and Schündeln, 2013; Feenstra, Hong, Ma, and Spencer, 2013; DuyganBump, Levkov, and Montoriol-Garriga, 2015; Jacobson and von Schedvin, 2015; Cingano
and Pinotti, 2016).

The Benchmarking Bias

2.1

Empirical Framework

The basis of cross-industry cross-country models are theories linking outcomes for industries
in di¤erent countries to an interaction between country characteristics and technological
industry characteristics. For example, in Rajan and Zingales (1998), the outcome variable is
industry growth and the interaction is between country-level …nancial development and the
external-…nance dependence of industries. In Nunn (2007), the outcome variable is industry
exports and the interaction is between country-level contract enforcement and the intensity
with which industries use relationship-speci…c inputs. As the main theoretical prediction
concerns the e¤ect of the interaction between country and industry characteristics, crossindustry cross-country models allow controlling for country and industry …xed e¤ects. An
empirical framework that encompasses the models used in the cross-industry cross-country
literature is
(1)

yin =

n

+

i

+ xn zin + vin

where yin is the outcome in industry i = 1; ::; I and country n = 1; ::; N ; xn the relevant
country characteristic; and zin the relevant industry characteristic. The

n

and

i

denote

country and industry …xed e¤ects and vin unobservable determinants of the outcome. The
parameter of interest is the coe¢ cient on the industry-country interaction, . We take vin
to be distributed independently of zin and xn to abstract from omitted variable and reverse
causation issues. We also assume that vin has a …nite variance and E(vin jn) = E(vin ji) = 0,
XN
and take xn to be given with
(xn x)2 > 0 where x is the average of xn .
n=1

Estimation of

in (1) would be straightforward if there were data on the technological

industry characteristics zin for a broad set of countries. But detailed industry data are
unavailable for most countries. Moreover, the cross-industry cross-country literature often
focuses on technological industry characteristics that are not directly observable and must
therefore be inferred from industry behavior. Such inference is likely to be more reliable in
countries where markets are not too distorted. In practice, zin is generally proxied using
industry data from a benchmark country, almost always the US.
It is therefore important to understand whether

in (1) can be estimated using industry

characteristics from a benchmark country as a proxy for zin . For such a benchmarking
estimator to stand a chance, there must be some global element to an industry’s technological
characteristics. At the same time, it seems unreasonable to presume that industries use the
same technology in all countries, as the optimal technology choice depends on many factors
4

that vary across countries (e.g., Bernard and Jones, 1996; Acemoglu and Zilibotti, 2001;
Schott, 2004; Caselli, 2005). We therefore model the industry characteristics zin in (1) as
the sum of a global industry characteristic (zi ) and a country-speci…c industry characteristic
("in )
(2)

zin = zi + "in

where zi is i.i.d. with variance V ar(z ) and independent of other elements of the model.2
The country-speci…c industry characteristics "in allow us to capture that industry characteristics may be more similar for some country-pairs than others in a simple way. We assume
E("in jn) = E("in ji) = 0; E("2in jn) =

2

; E("in "jm jn; m) = 0 for all industries i 6= j; and the

following correlation of idiosyncratic industry characteristics for country pairs n 6= m
(3)

Corr("in "im jn; m) =

mn

.

Hence, the correlation of industry characteristics zin for country pairs n 6= m is
(4)

Corr(zin ; zim jn; m) =

V ar(z )
V ar(z ) +

2
2

+

V ar(z ) +

:
2 mn

Corr(zin ; zim jn; m) can be interpreted as an index of technological similarity and country
pairs with greater

2.2

mn

are therefore more similar technologically.

The Bias

As data on the technological industry characteristics zin are unavailable for a broad set of
countries, the cross-industry cross-country literature proceeds using a proxy from a benchmark country. We refer to this proxy as ziU S as the benchmark country is almost always the
US. Hence, the equation estimated in the cross-industry cross-country literature is
(5)

yin = an + ai + bxn ziU S + residualin

where an and ai stand for country and industry …xed e¤ects. The main coe¢ cient of interest
in the literature is b and the method of estimation is least squares.3
To understand the relationship between the least-squares estimator of b in (5) and

in

(1), which is the parameter of interest, it is useful to rewrite the least-squares estimator in
2
While it is reasonable to think of industry characteristics as also re‡ecting a country-speci…c component,
we can omit such components in (2) without any loss of generality as they can be absorbed into the country
…xed e¤ects in (1).
3
Applications where the exogeneity of xn is an issue also use instrumental-variables estimation. Our
…ndings carry over to these instances. The easiest way to see this is to think of (5) as the reduced-form
equation.

For example, this will be the case if the index of technological similarity with the US is the

equally well for technological industry characteristics in all other countries, Corr(zU S ; zn ) =
> 0. In this case, bba =
where plays the role of the reliability ratio in the classical

measurement error model (e.g. Wooldridge, 2002).

A somewhat more general su¢ cient condition for bb to be biased towards zero is that the

index of technological similarity with the US, Corr(zU S ; zn ), is decreasing in the country
characteristic xn , but that Corr(zU S ; zn )xn is increasing in xn (if the latter condition is not
satis…ed, the benchmarking estimator may have the wrong sign).

The left-hand side of the inequality in (10) turns out to be the standard formula for the
least-squares slope of a regression of Corr(zU S ; zn )xn on xn . Hence, the condition for an
ampli…cation bias in (10) is equivalent to a least-squares slope greater unity when regressing
Corr(zU S ; zn )xn on xn . For this to be the case, the index of technological similarity of country
n with the US, Corr(zU S ; zn ), must be strictly increasing in the country characteristic xn
over some range.
To develop some intuition for the ampli…cation bias, it is useful to rewrite the model in
(1) in terms of two equations
(11)

yin =

where
(12)
The country-speci…c slope parameters

capture cross-country di¤erences in how industry

outcomes covary with industry characteristics. For example, in Rajan and Zingales (1998)
these slope parameters would capture cross-country di¤erences in the covariation between
industry growth and the external-…nance dependence of industries. In Nunn (2007), the
slope parameters would capture cross-country di¤erences in the covariation between industry
exports and the relationship-speci…c input intensity of industries.
Now imagine estimating the country-speci…c slopes

n

in (11) with least squares using

US industry characteristics ziU S as a proxy of industry characteristics zin . The resulting
least-squares slopes bn re‡ect the covariation between industry outcomes in country n and

US industry characteristics ziU S . Substituting the least-squares slopes bn in (6) yields that
the benchmarking estimator can be expressed as the least-squares slope of a regression of
the country-speci…c slope estimates bn on the country characteristics xn

Equation (14) shows that the bias of the benchmarking estimator will re‡ect how the bias
of the country-speci…c least-squares slopes covaries with the country characteristic xn . As
a result, the ampli…cation bias can arise even if all country-speci…c slope estimates are
attenuated because of classical measurement error, as long as the attenuation bias is weaker
for countries with greater xn .
A setting where countries fall into two groups The ampli…cation bias emerges most
clearly in a setting where countries except the US fall into two groups, A and B, and countries
in the same group are identical. In this two-group setting, (13) simpli…es to
bb = bA
xA

(16)

bB

That is, the benchmarking estimator is simply the slope of the line connecting the two points
(xA ; bA ) and (xB ; bB ). Making use of (15), the probability limit of (16) is

Corr(ziU S ; zin jn) for all countries n in group A and Corr(zU S ; zB ) is

de…ned analogously. There is an ampli…cation bias if and only if the term in parenthesis is

greater than unity. The simplest way to see that the ampli…cation bias can be very large
is to consider the case where where (i) countries in group A have the same technological
characteristics as the US and US industry characteristics therefore proxy perfectly for industry characteristics of these countries, Corr(zU S ; zA ) = 1, but (ii) countries in group B have
technological characteristics that di¤er from the US to the point where US industry characteristics are uncorrelated with industry characteristics of these countries, Corr(zU S ; zB ) = 0.
In this case, (17) simpli…es to

Hence, there will be an ampli…cation bias if xA > xB > 0 and the bias will be very large if
the two groups of countries have very similar characteristics x. This is because in this case
there is a strong positive association between the country characteristic xn and technological
similarity with the US.

More generally, the ampli…cation bias

Estimating Comparative Advantage Models with a
Benchmarking Estimator

The (standard) benchmarking estimator of the empirical cross-industry cross-country literature has been used widely to investigate the determinants of comparative advantage in
international trade (e.g. Romalis, 2004; Levchenko, 2007; Nunn, 2007; Manova, 2008, 2013;
Cuñat and Melitz, 2012). In this context, there turns out to be a new benchmarking estimator that yields a lower bound on the strength of comparative advantage under the assumption
that at least one pair of countries di¤ers in the direction of comparative advantage. We …rst
illustrate the argument in a model of comparative advantage where all countries except the
US fall into two groups and countries in the same group are identical. A special feature of this
setting is that the new benchmarking estimator turns out to be identical to the (standard)
benchmarking estimator used in the literature. Then we discuss the new benchmarking
estimator in a more general setting (where the new benchmarking estimator is no longer
identical to the benchmarking estimator used in the cross-industry cross-country literature).

Model and Assumptions

It is useful to rewrite (without loss of generality) the country characteristic xn in (11) and
(12) as xn = qn

q . This yields

(19)

yin =

(20)

n

n

+

i

+

= (qn

n zin

+ vin

q ):

qn is the country characteristic that may determine a country’s comparative advantage and
q the value of qn where comparative advantage switches from high-z industries to low-z
industries as long as
advantage

6= 0. We can obtain a lower bound on the strength of comparative

under two assumptions. The …rst assumption, which is standard in the com-

parative advantage literature using the cross-industry cross-country approach, is that high-z
industries in the US also tend to be high-z industries elsewhere. The second assumption –
which will turn out to be testable –is that there is at least one country on either side of the
threshold q . Formally:
(A1) High-z industries in the US tend to be high-z industries elsewhere, Corr(zU S ; zn ) > 0.
(A2) There is at least one country on either side of the threshold q , that is (qn
q ) < 0 for at least one pair of countries n, m. Or equivalently, as long as

q )(qm

6= 0, at least

one country has a comparative advantage in high-z industries and at least one country has
a comparative advantage in low-z industries.
A setting where countries fall into two groups To illustrate why these two assumptions allow for a benchmarking estimator that yields a lower bound on the true strength of

comparative advantage, we return to the setting where countries except the US fall into two
groups and countries in the same group are identical. A special feature of this setting is that
the new benchmarking estimator turns out to be identical to the (standard) benchmarking
estimator used in the literature. We can therefore illustrate the argument using the standard
benchmarking estimator and postpone the introduction of the new benchmarking estimator.
As shown above, in the setting where countries except the US fall into two groups and
countries in the same group are identical, the key formulas for the (standard) benchmarking
estimator bb used in the cross-industry cross-country literature simplify to (16) and (17).
Substituting xn = qn

The benchmarking estimator bb will be attenuated and therefore yield a lower bound on the

Both conditions will be satis…ed if assumptions (A1) and (A2) hold. To see this, notice
that because countries in the same group are identical, assumption (A2) is equivalent to
(qA

q ) < 0: Combined with assumption (A1), this implies that the left-hand side

of (23) is strictly negative while the right-hand side is positive. Assumptions (A1) and (A2)
also imply that the left-hand side of (24) is negative while the right-hand side is positive.
Hence, assumptions (A1) and (A2) imply that the term in parenthesis on the right-handside of (22) is strictly greater than zero but smaller than unity and that the benchmarking
estimator bb will be biased towards zero: When US industry characteristics are an imperfect

proxy for industry characteristics of countries in group A or group B; the inequality in (24)
will be strict and the benchmarking estimator bb will be strictly biased towards zero:

analogous.

To better understand this result, it is useful to compare …gure 2B where the benchmarking

…gures, all country-speci…c slope estimates are biased towards zero. But in …gure 1B this

results in the benchmarking estimator bb being biased away from zero, while in …gure 2B bb
is biased towards zero. From the …gures it becomes clear that this is because in …gure 2B,

there are countries on both sides of q and these countries di¤er in the direction of their
comparative advantage. As a result, the line connecting the country-speci…c slope estimates
in …gure 2B is a clockwise rotation of the line connecting the true country-speci…c slopes.
Hence, bba is necessarily biased towards zero.

3.2

A New Benchmarking Estimator

There continues to be a benchmarking estimator yielding a lower bound on the true strength
of comparative advantage associated with country characteristic qn in (19) and (20) when
there are many di¤erent countries (but this estimator is no longer the benchmarking estimator used in the cross-industry cross-country literature). To show this, we start with the
case where it is known which countries are on the same side of q . Or equivalently as long as
6= 0, the case where it is known which countries have a comparative advantage going in the

same direction. Then we turn to the case where the grouping of countries by the direction
of their comparative advantage is unknown.
3.2.1

Known Country Grouping

If it were known which countries are on the same side of q , we could put countries on one
side of q into group A and countries on the other side of q into group B. Then we could
estimate the strength of comparative advantage associated with country characteristic qn
using the following new benchmarking estimator
(25)

bbG = bnA
qA

bnB
qB

where bA and bB denote the average country-speci…c slope estimate for countries in group
A and group B; q A and q B are the average country characteristic in groups A and B (it does

not matter which group countries with qn at the threshold q are assigned to; we denote

the new benchmarking estimator with a subscript G because the estimator can be seen as a
grouped-data estimator).7 It is immediate that the new benchmarking estimator in (25) is
identical to the standard benchmarking estimator in (21) when countries in the same group
are identical. Hence, the argument in section 3.1 that the standard benchmarking estimator
is biased towards zero under assumptions (A1) and (A2) when countries in the same group
are identical, implies that the new benchmarking estimator is also biased towards zero in this
7

See Angrist (1991) for an application and a brief historical review of grouped-data estimation.

special case. In the general case where the strength of comparative advantage di¤ers among
countries with the same direction of comparative advantage, (i) the new benchmarking
estimator and the standard benchmarking estimator are no longer identical, and (ii) the
standard benchmarking estimator may be biased upward or downward even if assumptions
(A1) and (A2) hold. However, assumptions (A1) and (A2) imply that the new benchmarking
estimator in (25) is biased towards zero this general case also, and the new benchmarking
estimator therefore continues to yield a lower bound on the strength of the true e¤ect. To
see this, we …rst obtain the probability limit of (25) using (15), which yields

and

Both conditions will be satis…ed if assumptions (A1) and (A2) hold. To see this, notice that
the left-hand side of (27) is strictly negative as Corr(zU S ; znA ) > 0, Corr(zU S ; zmB ) > 0;
and at least one pair of countries di¤ers in the direction of their comparative advantage,
(qnA

q )(qmB

q ) < 0; and the right-hand side of (27) is positive as countries in the

same group have the same direction of comparative advantage, (qnA
and (qmB

q ) (q B

q )

q ) (q A

q )

0

0: A similar argument yields that the left-hand side of (28) is

negative while the right-hand side is positive. Hence, the term in parenthesis in (26) is strictly
greater than zero but smaller than unity and the grouping estimator bbG is biased towards
zero. When US industry characteristics are an imperfect proxy for industry characteristics

in at least one country where qn 6= q , the inequality in (28) will be strict and the new
benchmarking estimator bbG will be strictly biased towards zero.
8

The argument is analogous to that in footnote 6.

A 2SLS Interpretation The new benchmarking estimator in (25) turns out to have an

To see this, de…ne an indicator function 1n that assigns a value of 1 to countries in group
A and a value of 0 to all other countries (or the other way round). Now we can estimate
(30) using 2SLS with the product of the indicator function and the US industry characteristics ziU S 1n as an instrument for the interaction term ziU S qn . This 2SLS estimator can be
expressed in terms of demeaned data as

n

is now straightforward to show that the right-hand side of (31) is the same as the right-hand
side of (25) and hence bbG;2SLS = bbG .
3.2.2

Estimated Country Grouping

The 2SLS estimator in (31) cannot be implemented directly because we generally do not
know whether countries have a comparative advantage in high-z or low-z industries. As a
result, we cannot generate the necessary indicator function 1n . But it turns out that we can
estimate 1n consistently under the (testable) assumption

6= 0. As shown in Wooldridge

(2002, Section 6.1.2), the 2SLS estimator using a consistently estimated instrument is not

only consistent but has the same asymptotic distribution as the 2SLS estimator using the
actual instrument under weak conditions. Hence, we can obtain an estimate with the same
asymptotic distribution as bbG;2SLS by estimating the cross-industry cross-country model in
1n is a consistent estimator of
(30) with 2SLS and instrumenting ziU S qn with ziU S b
1n where b

1n . We now discuss two approaches to obtain such a consistent estimator. A simple approach

that only relies on the sign of the country-speci…c slope estimates and a second, somewhat

more complex, approach that also considers the country characteristic shaping the direction
of comparative advantage.
Simple Approach The …rst estimator, which we refer to as b
11n ; is an indicator that takes
the value of 1 for countries n with bn
that bn converges to

ban

=

0 and the value of 0 for all other countries. Recall

n Corr(zU S ; zn )

= (qn

q )Corr(zU S ; zn ), where we made use of

6= 0; assumption (A1) implies that ban has the same sign
for countries on the same side of q and b
11n is a consistent estimator of 1n : The hypothesis
(15) and (20). Hence, as long as

= 0 can be tested, as it implies that

n

= 0 for all countries n: We can therefore proceed

in three steps. First, estimate the least-squares slopes bn and test the hypothesis

n

=0

for all n: Second, if this hypothesis can be rejected, obtain the estimate of the indicator
function for each country b
11n . Third, estimate the model in (30) with 2SLS using ziU S b
11n as
an instrument for ziU S qn .

Alternative Approach There is a second, somewhat more complex, approach to obtain
a consistent estimator of the indicator function 1n . This approach di¤ers from the …rst
approach in that it also uses information on the characteristics qn that may be driving
countries’comparative advantage. To see the basic idea, suppose that

18

> 0 and that (20)

holds. In this case, countries with qn

q have a comparative advantage in high-z industries

and countries with qn < q have a comparative advantage in low-z industries. The idea of
the approach is to estimate q and then group countries according to whether qn is above
or below q . Estimating q would be simple if we observed
that maximizes the share of countries with qn
with qn < qb and

n

qb and

n

n:

We could chose a value qb

0 plus the share of countries

< 0. This can be thought of estimating q so as to maximize the

share of countries whose direction of comparative advantage conforms to (20). Once we have
obtained the threshold qb we could generate the indicator function 1n by assigning a value

qb and a value of 0 to all other countries. This approach

of 1 to countries n with qn

would yield a unique indicator function, although the threshold qb would not be unique,

as the data for the country characteristic qn are discrete. If one wants to ensure a unique

threshold also, this can be easily done by choosing qb from the set of values taken by the
country characteristic qn . An analogous approach can be used to obtain qb when
we observed

n,

< 0. If

we could chose a threshold qb from the set of values taken by the country

characteristic qn that maximizes the share of countries with qn
share of countries with qn < qb and

n

qb and

n

0 plus the

> 0. This can again be thought of as estimating q to

maximize the share of countries whose direction of comparative advantage conforms to (20).
In practice, we generally neither observe the

< 0. But instead of the

n

n

nor do we know whether

> 0 or

we can use the least-squares estimates bn , as their sign is a

consistent estimate of the direction of countries’comparative advantage under assumption
(A1). That we do not observe whether

> 0 or

< 0 can be taken care of by choosing either

the threshold estimated under the assumption

> 0 or the threshold estimated under the

assumption

< 0, depending on which yields a greater share of countries whose direction of

comparative advantage conforms to (20). Summarizing, the alternative approach generates a
consistent estimate of the indicator function 1n by splitting countries into two groups based
on an estimate of the threshold q . This estimate is obtained by maximizing the share of
countries whose estimated direction of comparative advantage conforms to (20).
To explain the second approach more formally, we need to introduce a considerable
amount of notation. Let Q be the set that collects the values of qn for all countries n. De…ne
p( qj q 2 Q) as the share of countries with qn

q and a comparative advantage in high-z

industries plus the share of countries with qn < q and a strict comparative advantage in
low-z industries,
(32)

p( qj q 2 Q) = share of countries with

qn < q and
qn q and

qQ have a comparative advantage

going in the same direction and countries with qn < qQ also have a comparative advantage

> 0, qQ is straightforward to determine as it is the unique

value maximizing p( qj q 2 Q): Similarly, qQ is also straightforward to determined if
as it is the unique value maximizing s( qj q 2 Q). Collecting the cases

> 0 and

< 0,
< 0 it

follows that as long as 6= 0; we can determine qQ as
8
< argmax p(qj q 2 Q) if max p( qj q 2 Q) max s( qj q 2 Q)
:
(34)
qQ =
: argmax s( qj q 2 Q) if max s( qj q 2 Q) > max p( qj q 2 Q)
To see this, notice that if

> 0, max p( qj q 2 Q) = 1 while max s( qj q 2 Q) = 0 except if

there are countries that happen to have a value of qn exactly equal to q ; in this case, max

s( qj q 2 Q) = M=N with N the number of countries and M the number of countries with
qn = q . On the other hand, if

< 0, max s( qj q 2 Q) = 1 while max p( qj q 2 Q) = 0 except

if there are countries that happen to have a value of qn exactly equal to q ; in this case, max
p( qj q 2 Q) = M=N .

Using (34), we can obtain a consistent estimator of qQ once we have consistent estimators

of p(q) and s(q). Moreover, consistent estimators of p(q) and s(q) are straightforward to …nd
under assumption (A1). In this case, ban

0 if and only if

n

0, see (15). Hence, we can

obtain consistent estimators pb(q) and sb(q) of p(q) and s(q) by replacing

n

by bn in (32)

and (33): Then we can replace p(q) and s(q) by pb(q) and sb(q) in (34) to obtain a consistent

estimator qbQ of qQ . Finally, we can obtain our alternative consistent estimator of 1n as the
indicator function b
12n that assigns a value of 1 to all countries n with qn qbQ and the value
of 0 to all other countries (or the other way around).
3.2.3

Applying the 2SLS Grouping Estimator

We now illustrate the alternative benchmarking estimator in the context of Nunn’s (2007)
empirical analysis of the e¤ect of contract enforcement on comparative advantage in industries that depend more on relationship-speci…c intermediate inputs (see also Levchenko,
2007, and Costinot, 2009, for related empirical and theoretical …ndings). Nunn’s analysis is
based on the cross-industry cross-country model
(35)

ln ein = an + ai + bziU S qn + residualin
20

where ln ein is the log value of exports of country n in industry i; qn the quality of contract
enforcement in country n; and ziU S a measure of industry i’s dependence on relationshipspeci…c intermediate inputs obtained using US data. Nunn’s key …nding is that b is positive
and statistically signi…cant, indicating that countries with better contract enforcement export
relatively more in industries that depend more on relationship-speci…c intermediate inputs.
To apply our 2SLS benchmarking estimator, we …rst need to estimate the country-speci…c
slopes
(36)

n

= bqn in
ln ein =

n

+

i

+

n ziU S

+ residualin :

The least-squares slope estimates bn tell us how much more country n exports in industries

that depend more on relationship-speci…c intermediate inputs. We plot these estimates
against the quality of contract enforcement qn in …gure 4. The second step is to use the
least-squares slope estimates bn to test the hypothesis that

= 0 (by testing whether

= 0 for all n). This hypothesis is rejected at any conventional con…dence level. The
12n
third step is to use the least-squares slope estimates to obtain the two indicators b
11n and b
n

that group countries by the direction of their comparative advantage.9 We can then obtain
an estimate of the e¤ect of better contract enforcement on exports in relationship-speci…c
input industries by applying 2SLS to (35) and instrumenting the interaction ziU S qn with
12n , or both. We proceed using both instruments simultaneously as this is the
ziU S b
11n , ziU S b
most e¢ cient approach. Using Nunn’s baseline speci…cation (in his Table IV), this yields a
standardized beta coe¢ cient of 0:361 with a standard error of 0:015. Nunn’s estimate using

the standard cross-industry cross-country benchmarking estimator is 0:289 with a standard
error of 0:013. Hence, our new benchmarking estimator –which provides a lower bound on
the strength of the true e¤ect under assumptions (A1) and (A2) –yields that better contract
enforcement is even more important for exports in relationship-speci…c input industries than
the estimator of the cross-industry cross-country literature.
The estimator b
11n assigns countries with a positive least-squares slopes bn a value of 1 and all other
countries a 0. The estimator b
12n assigns countries with a value for the quality of contract enforcement qn
above 0.588 a value of 1 and all other countries a 0 (that is qbQ is estimated to be 0.588).

Conclusion

Cross-industry cross-country models are used extensively in economics. The approach has
attractive features, like its focus on theoretical mechanisms and the possibility to control for
country-level determinants of economic activity. But there are also drawbacks. Implementation requires specifying technological industry characteristics that are generally unobservable
and must therefore be proxied with industry characteristics in a benchmark country. That
this can lead to an attenuation bias is unsurprising. What appears to not be understood is
that using data from a benchmark country to approximate industry characteristics elsewhere
can also lead to a (large) ampli…cation bias when technologically similar countries are similar
in other dimensions.
A main area of application of cross-industry cross-country models is international trade,
where these models have been used to examine the e¤ects of factor endowments and institutions on comparative advantage. We show that in this context there is an estimator that
yields a lower bound on the true e¤ect, as long as some countries di¤er in the direction of
their comparative advantage.
