Changing Patterns of International Investment In and By the United States

ABSTRACT

The international investment account of the United States has gone
through several cycles. Before World War I, the U.S. was a borrower most
of the time and an international debtor. Between the two World Wars, it
was first a lender and then a refuge for foreign capital. After World War
II, the U.S. became the world's major lender and creditor and in the last
few years it has become the world's largest borrower, and, according to the
official accounts, even a net debtor.
U.S. direct investment abroad began while the U.S. was still an
overall borrower and debtor. The technological leaders among U.S. manufacturing firms pioneered in this technique for exploiting their particular
knowledge and skills by producing in other countries. The peak in the
importance of foreign assets relative to the domestic assets of U.S. companies was probably reached during the early 1970s.
While the flow of direct investment from the U.S. has slowed, there
has recently been a large inflow of foreign direct investment into the
U.S.. That inflow has roughly tripled the share of foreign-owned companies
in the U.S. since 1950.

While foreign-owned firms accounted for only about 33 per cent of
total U.S. employment after all the recent growth in foreign direct investment in the U.S., the shares in manufacturing and wholesale trade were considerably higher. Foreign firms accounted for almost 40 per cent of
chemical industry employment, but for less than 10 per cent in all the
other industries. The foreign shares in service industries, aside from
wholesale trade, increased, but remained below 3 per cent.

CHANGING PATTERNS OF INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT IN AND BY THE UNITED STATES

Robert E. Lipsey

1. Introduction

After World War II, the United States became the major supplier of capital
in world markets, and that role appeared for many years to be a permanent one.

The recent swing to being the world's largest borrower is a reminder that the
U.S. history in this respect has been a cyclical one since the late nineteenth century, alternating between periods of capital exporting and capital
importing. These swings were mainly based on economic circumstances, but at
times wars and threats of wars, revolutions, and other types of government

instability made investment flow uphill, against the pull of purely economic
forces.

A more constant feature than the direction of the capital flow has been
the association of U.S. capital exports with the export of technology and

management. Americans were the innovators in exporting the package of management, technology, and capital, sometimes even without the capital, that is
known as foreign direct investment: the ownership of production facilities
in one country by firms based in another country.

This paper was prepared for an NBER conference on The Changing Role of
the United States in the World Economy, held in Palm Beach, Florida, March
5—8, 1987. The paper is part of the NBER's program in International
Studies and draws on research carried on under grants from the National
Science Foundation and the Ford Foundation and a PSC—CUNY research award. I
am indebted to J. David Richardson and Richard Levich for very helpful comments on an earlier draft and to James Hayes, Linda Molinari, and Rosa
Schupbach for help in checking my work and in preparing the manuscript. The
views expressed are my own and do not necessarily represent those of the
National Bureau or of any of the sponsors of the research cited.

The development of this type of multinational enterprise and the changes
that have taken place within it reflect the evolution of the competitiveness
and comparative advantage of American firms and their responses to changes in

political and economic circumstances. The innovation represented by these
U.S. enterprises has been increasingly copied by firms based in other
countries, with the result that many foreign firms have entered the U.S.

market, and multinational activity has become a feature even of firms from
developing countries.

Against the relatively steady growth of direct investment, first out of
the U.S. and then into it, there have been large swings in other forms of
investment. Most of foreign investment in the U.S. has been portfolio rather
than direct investment; that is, it has not included foreign control of U.S.
enterprises. The U.S. too has engaged in brief, but very large, spurts in
portfolio investing in foreign countries. These are important, despite their
infrequency, because they have been so large, at times outrunning the steadier
trends in direct investment.

2. Historical Background
Foreign Investment in the U.S. Before World War I.

The recent metamorphosis of the U.S. into a large international borrower
has been unsettling. It is an unfamiliar role and has been for many decades,

but it is not a totally new one. It is a return to the pattern of the first

century of the existence of the U.S. Most of the time from George
Washington's inauguration until an abrupt turn to capital exporting at the end
of the 19th century, the U.S. had been a net borrower in foreign financial
markets.

The cumulation of borrowing year after year until the end of the 19th
century meant that the U.S. was a net debtor throughout these years, and it
was still a net debtor at the beginning of World War I, despite 15 or 20 years
in which the U.S. was a net foreign lender most of the time.

An indication of the size of the debt relative to the U.S. economy is
that the net indebtedness was about 3 per cent of U.S. national wealth or
tangible assets (land, structures, equipment, and inventories) in 1900, and
the indebtedness of 1914 was a little over 2 per cent of national wealth in
1912. U.S. gross indebtedness in 1914, including foreign holdings of direct
investment, was about 2J per cent of total tangible and financial assets in
the U.S. in 1912 (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1975, Series F 377 and F 378).

There are several ways to view the role of these flows of financial capi-

—5—
tal in American development. One is as a source of financing for aggregate
capital formation, permitting faster accumulation of capital than would have
taken place if only domestic financing had been available. On this basis, it
is hard to suppose that imports of capital had a great influence on the rate

of development, at least during most of the 19th century. The capital inflows
never reached more than 1i per cent of total output in any decade from the
1830's through the first 10 years of the twentieth century and were probably
never more than 6 or possibly 7 per cent of gross capital formation.

In general, U.S. borrowing from foreign countries rose when U.S. capital

formation surged, and tapered off as U.S. saving, rising more gradually and
steadily, caught up with capital formation. Thus, investment from abroad
accommodated the large spurts in the demand for capital that characterized the

-6rapidly growing economy.

There may have been other roles for borrowing from abroad. One might have
been to supply funds for particularly risky forms of capital formation at a
lower interest rate than would have been required by domestic lenders. Another
may have been to supply funds when, in the face of heavy demands by rapidly
growing sectors, U.S. domestic lenders' needs for diversification of risks made

them reluctant to offer sufficient financing to these sectors. A somewhat different interpretation is that U.S. railway and government securities, relatively safe and requiring less local knowledge than investment in smaller scale
enterprises in agriculture, mining and manufacturing, tended to be sold overseas, while domestic suppliers of capital invested in the riskier, but more profitable sectors (Edelstein 1982, 237—238).

The bulk of foreign investment in the U.S. was portfolio investment
rather than direct investment. That is, it consisted of purchases of bonds or,

to a small extent, equities that did not involve control over the enterprise
receiving the capital. Just before World War I, about 80 per cent of the stock
of long-term foreign investment in the U.S. was portfolio investment, and the
same had been true for the flow over a long period (Edeistein 1982, 36
and 37).

Governments and railways were the chief borrowers and most of the financing
was in the form of bonds rather than equities. Most of the foreign investment,
whether for governments or private companies, went to large, lumpy, social
overhead capital projects, such as canals, railways, electrical utilities, and
telephone and telegraph systems (Edeistein 1982, pp. 39-41). Manufacturing

enterprises were probably almost all too small to seek foreign financing or
even, in most cases, public financing from domestic sources.

There were instances of manufacturing enterprises set up by foreign
craftsmen or entrepreneurs with special knowledge or skill.

However, in an

era in which transportation and communication were slow by modern standards,
these often involved the migration of the owners and eventual conversion of
their enterprises into domestic entities. Thus, these enterprises involved
mainly a flow of human capital to the U.S.

We do not deal with the flow of human capital here, but it may have been
more important to U.S. development than the flows of financial capital. In

terms of numbers, immigration into the U.S. in each decade from the 1830s

—8through the beginning of World War I ranged from about 5 to 10 per cent of
the number already in the country (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1975, Series A 6
and C 89). Furthermore, most of the immigrants (a 50 per cent larger proportion than in the population as a whole) were between 15 and 44 years of age
(U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1975, Series C 119, C 122-27, C 138, and C 141).

They came to the U.S., therefore, with most of their rearing costs already
incurred and with a large part of their working lives still ahead of them.
The Beginnings of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad

The U.S. has been unique among the major investing countries in that the
principal form of its investment has been, from the earliest times recorded,

direct rather than portfolio investment. That is, it has typically involved
control of foreign operations rather than simply the lending of capital to
foreign-controlled firms or to governments. The earliest estimates, for 1897,
show over 90 per cent of U.S. investment to have been of this type.
The earliest examples of U.S. direct investment took place while the U.S.

was still, on net balance, an importer of capital. They illustrate the key
role of the export of technology, or other firm-specific assets, as contrasted
to the pure export of capital, as is the case with portfolio investment.

37), with

salaried sales representatives abroad in the early 1860s and its first foreign
factory by the late 1860s (p. 42). Other early American production abroad
during the period when the U.S. was still a capital importer was by Hoe
(printing presses), Babcock and Wilcox (boilers), International Bell Telephone

and Western Electric, Edison Electric, Thomson—Houston Electric, a component
of General Electric when it was formed later, Westinghouse Air Brake, Kodak,
McCormick, Worthington Pump, Chicago Pneumatic Tool, Otis Elevator, National
Cash Register, and Libbey-Owens (Southard 1931; Wilkins 1970, Chapter III).
These companies were typically early technological leaders in their fields.
Another indication of the importance of technology rather than capital is the
number of instances in which the parent's investment consisted entirely or
largely of patent-rights, as in the case of Ford in Canada, Libbey-Owens Glass
in various European countries, and Westinghouse Electric in the U.K. (Lewis
1938, 300-301).

The Transformation of the U.S. International Balance Sheet, 1914-1919
The beginning of World War I found the U.S. still a substantial international net debtor, but the events of the next few years transformed the

country's international balance sheet. As a result of wartime lending by the
U.S. and especially the liquidation of foreign claims against the U.S. in the
form of holdings of U.S. securities, this country ended the period as a net
creditor in international markets.

The U.S. became a net creditor even on private account, aside from the
inter-government debt of almost $10 billion that was to bedevil international
negotiations on reparations and other topics through the interwar years.
The U.S. as an International Investor, 1919-1929

The period of the 1920s, and particularly the late 1920s, was exceptional
in the history of U.S. investing abroad in two respects. One was that the
growth of portfolio investment was far greater than that of direct investment,
to the extent that the stock of portfolio investment exceeded that of direct
investment for the first and only time at the end of that period.

Almost the whole history of U.S. direct investment in foreign public utilities is concentrated in the few years between 1924 and 1929. The increase in

the stock of public utility investment in these years was almost 80 per cent
of the 1929 total as compared with less than 30 per cent for all industries
combined.

More than a third of the growth in direct investment between 1924 and 1929
was in South America, the location of less than fifth of such investment in
1924, and over a quarter of the growth in portfolio investment was directed
there in these years, although the initial share was only 10 per cent. Another
way of describing the temporal concentration of investment in South America is
that almost half of the stock of direct investment and almost two thirds of
the stock of portfolio investment in South America in 1929 were accounted for
by the growth between 1924 and 1929.

The changes in value, especially for portfolio investment, reflect some
price changes as well as new investment. However, these data do not reflect
the price changes on individual issues but only changes in exchange rates. In
any case, very little of the investment was in common stock (about 5 per
cent), and almost all the loans were dollar loans (about 95 per cent), so that
neither possible source of price change, stock prices or exchange rates, could
have been of much importance. Thus, the changes in portfolio investment must
represent a tremendous flurry of new financing during this period.

The reasons for this concentrated burst of portfolio investment were probably different from those behind the direct investment in utilities. The two
U.S. companies that were the ultimate parents of most of the utility affi-

— 16 -

hates

were major manufacturers of the capital goods purchased by the

utilities. Neither one was a domestic company in the industries in which these
affiliates operated. The ownership of foreign utilities was, in effect, a way
of exploiting the parents! advantages in technology and marketing in the
telephone and electric power equipment manufacturing industries. The concentration of these investments in Latin America and their decline were at
least partly the result of government monopolization and regulation, earlier
in Europe and later in Latin America and Asia as well.

The burst of portfolio investment in the late 1920s was fueled by some of
the same speculative spirit that propelled the U.S. stock market in those
years. The concentration in South American investment represented, according
to one very thorough study (Mintz 1951) and many contemporary accounts, a
large decline in the quality of credit extended, as the boom of the late 1920s
progressed. The fall in quality -is summarized by the fact that of the loans

extended in the first half of the 1920s, only 18 per cent went into default
later, while the share of defaults was 50 per cent for loans extended in
1925-29 (Mintz 1951, 6).

Defaults and Liquidations, 1929—1935

After the large build-up of portfolio assets and liabilities in the
last few years of the 1920's, the depression of the 1930s led to a wave of
liquidations of security holdings and of defaults on foreign bonds among U.S.
investments abroad as well. In addition, asset and liability values decreased

as a result of declines in prices, but much of this decline is concealed by

the use of book values for bonds. We do have a rough estimate of U.S. international assets with defaulted bonds valued at market, but we do not have a
similar estimate for market values of other securities or direct investment.

Even without any allowance for default or price depreciation on bonds,

we can observe a decline of more than a quarter in securities assets, a
reduction of short-term assets by almost half, and a decline of about 20

per cent in securities liabilities. The market value of U.S. security
holdings, taking account of depreciation on defaulted bonds but not on other
securities, declined almost 50 per cent.

By 1935, the primacy of direct investment among U.S. assets had reap-

- 18

-

peared. Some of the direct investment values may be inflated by the use of
book values. Still, mismeasurement of capital stock is not responsible for
the main story, as can be seen from the capital flow data. The U.S. continued
to invest in controlled companies abroad, at least for the first couple of

years, and the decline in value of these investments must therefore have
stemmed largely from exchange rate changes, and from declines before sale in
the value of assets sold during the period.

The data for long-term portfolio and short-term investment reveal a

repatriation to the U.S. of about $2 billion. The rest of the $3 billion
decline in U.S. portfolio assets may reflect some losses from declines in the

- 19

—

value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. On the other
side,
the decline in foreign portfolio and short-term assets in the U.S. of almost
$3 billion was less than half accounted for by capital flows during the
period.

The U.S. ran a surplus on goods and services during this period of more

than $3 billion. The deficits of the U.S. partner countries were financed not
by private capital flows but by an absorption of gold by the U.S. of about $3
billion in the last two years of the period.
The U.S. as a Destination of Flight Capital, 1935-1940
Despite the low level of economic activity in the U.S. in the second
half of the 1930s, foreign private investment in the U.S. more than

doubled. The fastest growth was in short-terni investment, which more than
quadrupled, but every category of foreign investment grew.

In contrast, both U.S. direct and U.S. portfolio investment abroad

declined, especially the latter. The $7 billion increase in foreign investment in the U.S. in combination with a cumulative U.S. surplus on goods and
services of almost $5 billion, were financed largely by a $12 billion flow of
reserve assets into the U.S. government's account.

An indication of the size of this capital flow is that over the five

years it was almost 20 per cent of gross capital formation and greater than

— 21 —

net capital formation. In effect, the capital inflow was financing all net
capital formation in the U.S. during this period.

With this large inflow of capital, the U.S., after 20 or so years as a
net creditor on private account, slipped back into the position of a net
debtor, aside from U.S. government holdings of official reserve assets.
Effects of World War II and the Reconstruction Period on the
U.S. International Capital Position
In contrast to World War I, when foreigners liquidated well over half
their long-term investments in the U.S., foreign holdings of private U.S.
assets were unchanged between the beginning and end of World War II.

Foreign holdings of U.S. government securities grew substantially, while the
U.S. private sector raised its foreign assets by about 20 per cent. The U.S.
remained a net debtor outside of its official reserve assets.
After 1945, the U.S. resumed its acquisition of private foreign assets,
mainly direct investments, and by 1950 the U.S. was once again a net creditor
even outside its official reserve assets. A $35 billion cumulative surplus in
net exports of goods and services in the late 1940's was financed partly by

— 23 —

the growth of U.S. assets and by transfers, but a large fraction--more than
a
third—-was financed by an accumulation of official reserve in the hands of the
U.S.

3. The Internationalization of U.S. Companies
The Growth of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad After World War II
After 1950, the growth of U.S. direct investment abroad, slowed by the
Great Depression and World War II, resumed its rise. One measure of the spread
of U.S. firms, the number of new affiliates established, rose rapidly to a
peak until the late 1960s, and then slowed down.

These data are confined to a fixed group of corporations that had become
multinational by the time the sample was selected, and the decline in the rate

of

establishment may have represented only the exhaustion of profitable loca-

tions for new affiliates by this particular group of parents. Furthermore, the

data take no account of the size of the newly established affiliates or of
their growth after establishment.

Another measure of foreign direct investment is the value of such investment, measured as the book value of parent investment in affiliates as
reported on the books of affiliates. Since these values are, of course,

affected by inflation and by the growth of the economy in general, we compare
the value of direct investment in foreign countries with the total assets of
U.S. corporations.

from Federal Reserve Board 1979 and 1986 and Musgrave 1986a and
1986b.

These ratios suggest that the peak importance of foreign investment rela-

tive to all U.S. corporate assets was in

the

early or mid-1970s, although the

year—to—year fluctuations make it difficult to identify a precise peak.
Foreign investment was always less important in finance than in other
industries, and the ratio for all industries is greatly affected by the inclu—
sion of financial corporations. Overseas investment was a much higher proportion of the assets of nonfinancial corporations than of those of financial

corporations or all corporations, but the time pattern appears to have been

- 26

similar:

—

a peak at some point between 1966 and 1977 (comparable data for

intervening

years are not available) and then a decline to the levels of the

1950s.

The amount of investment relative to assets is only one of several

possible measures of the international activities of U.S. firms. It is the one
that can be carried back the furthest, but it has several drawbacks. At best
it measures the financial stake in overseas affilitates, but it does not
reflect the level of activity carried on there. U.S. firms could be increasing
the share of production they carry on abroad or the share of their employment
abroad while reducing their investment in foreign affiliates and still
retaining control of them. More serious problems of measurement arise from the
fact that the investment in foreign affiliates is measured in book values
rather than current values and that these are subject to the vagaries of
currency translation. The tangible assets of all U.S. firms, in the denomina—
tor of the ratio, are estimated current values. The high inflation rates of

the late 1970s and early 1980s must have raised the totals for U.S. firms
assets relative to the values on the books of affiliates, and the rise in the

value of the dollar from 1982 to 1985 must have had a similar effect. We must
therefore be somewhat skeptical about this evidence for a decline in the
importance of overseas activities.

A measure free of problems of valuation is provided by data on employment,
although this measure is also subject to question.

Commerce 1985g. Employment in affiliates from Brereton 1986 and
U.S. Department of Commerce 1975, 1981, and 1985a.
Relative to private non-agricultural employment in the U.S. (U.S. Department

of Commerce 1985g), employment in majority-owned affiliates (the only figures
available for 1966) rose between 1966 and 1977 (U.S. Department of Commerce
1975 and 1981). Between that date and 1982, all measures of employment

declined relative to U.S. employment, and nonbank affiliate employment continued to decline relatively through 1984 (U.S. Department of Commerce 1985a,
and Brereton 1986).

The main question about this measure is whether employment is a good
measure for comparing domestic and overseas labor input. For one thing, there
was a shift toward female and part-time employment in the U.S. that may not
have been matched overseas. Aside from the measurement problem, it is hard to
know whether the relative drop in affiliate employment from 1977 to 1982
reflects mainly the effect of the 1982 recession or is part of a declining

28 -

trend.
One indication in the opposite direction, discussed later, is that exports
from overseas affiliates have, within manufacturing, increased relative to
exports from the United States by the affiliates' parents and by the U.S. as a

whole. This measure also has defects. It has the advantage that all measures
are in current values, but it also reflects the changing degree of export orientation of affiliates, parents, and U.S. firms in general.

The main changes in the composition of U.S. investment abroad are
described in Table 1. The major shifts over the thirty years have been the
declines in importance of investment in the production of goods, especially
primary products, and in public utilities and transportation, and the rise in
importance of investment in trade and services. The fall in investment in pri-

mary production all took place before 1977, prior to the oil crises.
Investment in public utilities and transportation, accounting for 13 per cent
of investment in 1957, had been reduced to under 2 per cent by 1982. Within
the trade and services group, it was finance that was responsible for the
great increase in importance of the sector. There was some growth in the
importance of trade, but other services, especially outside of oil-field services, remained of small importance throughout, although they probably did
grow.

The Competitiveness and Comparative Advantage of U.S. Multinational Firms
It is customary to discuss the competitiveness of countries and of
industries in them in terms of their shares in world markets or of particular
markets. A country's competitiveness depends in the short-run on the effects
of its monetary and fiscal policies on prices and exchange rates and over
longer periods on the rate and direction of its advances in productivity.

— 29 —

To some extent, companies that become multinational in their operations
loosen their dependence on these home-country determinants of competitiveness.
If home-country production becomes more expensive relative to foreign produc—
tion because of rapid inflation at home or because the exchange value of the

home country's currency has risen, or because labor has risen in price or
decreased in efficiency, the multinational firm has some opportunity to shift
its production to locations in other countries.

The competitiveness of the multinational firm depends on the firm's
characteristics rather than on those of its home country. It may rest on the
possession of patents or other technological assets based on the firm's R & 0.
It may rest on the ability to manage or control certain types of production or

distribution operations. It may originate in access to raw materials on
favorable terms or in access to home-country markets. All these factors have
in common that they can be exploited wherever the firm operates. That is, they

are mobile geographically within the firm but relatively immobile Jetween
firms (Lipsey and Kravis 1985).

One could imagine a number of possible indicators of the competitiveness
of a firm or a group of firms. One would be its shares in world production or
world consumption of some set of products. Another would be the share in world
trade or in world exports of products or groups of products. Still others
would be shares in value added, employment, or capital. All the indicators
have drawbacks. The use of employment or capital shares relies on a single
factor of production when others may be equally important or may behave
differently. Value added may be affected by the shifting of profits to minimize taxes or for other reasons. Production or consumption are difficult to
use because world and area aggregates are difficult to assemble. They may also

- 30

-

be subject to manipulation by host-country governments controlling access to
their home markets.

Shares in export trade, used here as a competitiveness measure, have
drawbacks also-—for one, they slight firms and industries making products
that, because of weight or bulk, or for other reasons, tend to be supplied
from within the countries where they are consumed. Despite the drawbacks,

export shares have a number of advantages as measures of competitiveness. One
is that there are reasonably comprehensive world and regional aggregates

against which to measure a firm's share. The main advantage of using exports
rather than production for this purpose is that exports are more footloose. A
country has more power to determine which producers supply its home market
than which supply export markets. Shares in export markets may, therefore,

represent the underlying economic advantages of firms and countries to a
greater degree than do shares in production.

That is not to say that export markets are unaffected by government interventions or other non—economic factors. The imposition of export requirements
on U.S. affiliates by some governments as the price for acquisition of a local

firm in the host country or even for continued operation in the country has
been a source of much friction between the United States and these countries.

However, these export-promoting policies are circumscribed by the ability of
companies to leave markets where the costs imposed on them are too high. They
are also limited by the watchfulness of other countries over their own home
and export markets.

The competitiveness of U.S. multinationals, measured by their export
shares, can be described and compared to that of the U.S. as a country by the
following figures:

The shares of the U.S. and its multinationals were about equal in 1966, but
the multinationals kept their share remarkably constant while that of the U.S.
declined, particularly in the earlier years.
The parent firms of the U.S. multinationals did not escape the forces that
led to the fall in the U.S. export share, but the fall in the parents! share
was a little smaller than that of the U.S.:

The multinationals were more successful than non-multinational U.S. firms in

What kept the multinationals' share in world exports up was the success of
their exports from their foreign affiliates, a record that can be traced back

In the first 20 years, the shares of U.S. multinationals' affiliates in both
developed countries and LOC's grew rapidly, but after that, only the shares of
the LOC affiliates grew, while affiliates in the developed countries more or
less held their shares steady.

This

-

growth in exports from foreign affiliates implies that larger and

larger portions of world market shares outside the U.S. held by U.S. multinationals and by all U.S. firms were being supplied from production outside the
U.S., as can be seen from the following:

By 1983, almost half of all manufactured exports by U.S. multinationals and
over 40 per cent of manufactured exports by all U.S. firms were supplied by
foreign affiliates of the multinationals.

We can identify the comparative advantage of U.S. multinationals by the
industry distribution of their exports relative to that of the U.S. as a

country or of the world. Another way of putting this measure is saying that we
take the multinationals' share of exports in each industry relative to their

share in all industries combined. This measure is sometimes referred to as
"revealed comparative advantage" and has the drawbacks of such measures. For

example, it is not based on the presumed determinants of comparative advantage
and incorporates the effects of trade barriers, subsidies, and many other factors that can affect trade flows.

If we take these distributions for 1966, the first year for which we have
the data, we find that the U.S. as a country enjoyed comparative advantages
relative to the world as a whole in chemicals, machinery, and transport equipment, and comparative disadvantages in food products, metals, and miscella-

- 34

-

neous manufacturing industries.
The comparative advantages of U.S. multinationals were in the same
industries, but to a larger degree, and the same was true for the comparative
disadvantages of the multinationals. Thus, if we compare U.S. multinationals
with the U.S. as a country, the multinationals had comparative advantages over
other U.S. firms in chemicals, machinery, and especially transport equipment,
and disadvantages relative to the U.S. in foods, metals, and miscellaneous
manufacturing industries.

In other words, where the U.S. was strong, U.S. multinationals, taken as a
group, were stronger. And where the U.S. was weak, U.S. multinationals as a

group were weaker. That is not to say that there were no individual U.S.
multinationals with comparative advantages in foods or metals that permitted
them to operate in many countries. The data show that such firms were less
common in these industries than in chemicals or machinery.

years later, the main outlines of the story were similar. There

was a slight weakening of the U.S. position in chemicals and transport equipment, as well as in the already weak metals area, and a stronger comparative
advantage in machinery.

Within machinery, the U.S. comparative advantage in nonelectrical machinery
increased and that in electrical machinery declined.

U.S. multinationals increased their comparative advantage in chemicals
relative to the world and to the U.S. as a country, but their previously very
large comparative advantage relative to the world in transport equipment was

substantially reduced. Their comparative disadvantages in foods and metals
were also reduced, but remained large. In 1982, U.S. multinationals still
showed a large comparative advantage relative to the world in chemicals, non—

- 36

electrical

-

and electrical machinery, and transport equipment, but there was

one exception to the rule that their comparative advantages were an accentuated version of U.S. comparative advantage. That exception was in nonelectrical machinery, in which the comparative advantage of the U.S. as a
country exceeded that of the U.S. multinationals.
For 1977 and 1982 it is possible to examine the comparative advantage of
U.S. multinationals for a much finer breakdown of industry groups into 30 or
more industries. The industries in which U.S. multinationals exhibited the
largest comparative advantage relative to the world were, in order:
1. Tobacco products

2. Office and computing machinery
3. Electronic components
4. Soaps, cleansers, etc.
5. Drugs

6. Construction machinery

Source: Appendix Table 3

Of the six, four were also among the industries of greatest comparative advantage for the U.S. as a country, exceptions being the two chemicals groups.

These industries are characterized by high expenditures on R & D (office and
computing machinery, drugs, and electronic components) and on advertising
(tobacco products, drugs, soaps, cleansers, etc.)

The 1977-82 period was one in which the shift by multinationals from the
U.S. to their overseas affiliates as their export base, which was strong in
the previous decade, was interrupted and even reversed to a small extent. As
might be expected, there was wide variation among industries in this respect.

— 37 —

Most of the industries in which U.S. multinationals' exports rose rapidly saw
a continuation of the shift to overseas production for export. That category
included drugs, industrial chemicals, other chemicals, other transport equipment, plastic products, and instruments. Two major exceptions were office and

computing machinery and electronic components. There was not a major shift
back to the U.S. (in percentage terms) in these two industries, but there was
clearly no move away from U.S. operations.

By comparing the distributions of exports of U.S. multinationals for 1977
and 1982 with those of the U.S. for the same year, we can get some notion of

the distinctive comparative advantages of these firms, as compared with the

U.S. as a geographical entity (Appendix Table 5). Among the major groups, the
multinationals showed comparative advantages in chemicals, electrical machinery, and transport equipment, but not in foods, metals, non-electrical machinery, and "other manufacturing."

The ratios for more detailed industries are suggestive. Within foods, the
multinationals held a large advantage over other U.S. firms in beverages, pro-

bably an advertising-intensive industry. In chemicals, the largest advantage
was in soaps, cleaners, etc., also an advertising-intensive field, followed by
drugs and, by a small margin, industrial chemicals, the former extremely
R & D-intensjve, the latter a little above average. In non-electrical machi-

nery, the largest advantage of multinationals over other U.S. firms was in
office and computing machinery, by far the most R & D-intensive group. In the
electrical machinery group, the multinationals' advantages were large relative
to the U.S. in electronic components and, in 1982, also in communications
equipment, both R & D—intensive industries, but not in "other electrical
machinery," the most P & 0-intensive. However, in electrical machinery, the

- 38

lines

—

are quite blurry among the detailed industries. Many parents seem to

cross these detailed industry lines.

There are a number of indications here that both R & D intensity and
advertising intensity are major factors in the comparative advantage of U.S.

multinationals, and both have been associated with U.S. firms' shares in
foreign markets (for example, in Caves 1974). R & 0 intensity is a variable
that has been associated in many studies with the comparative advantage of the
U.S. as a country (for example, Baldwin 1979, and Stern and Maskus 1981). Our
data confirm that association. If we relate the share of an industry in U.S.

exports relative to its share in world exports (U.S./W) to the R & D intensity
of industries, as measured by the ratio of R & 0 expenditures to sales (RD/S),

we find we can explain a substantial part (4O) of the inter—industry differences in U.S. export shares in 1977 with that factor alone:

Exporting is most important for affiliates in primary production-—
agriculture, mining, and the extraction of petroleum-—in all of which a
majority of sales were outside the host country. The reason for the exportorientation of affiliates in these industries is that they were drawn to their
locations not by the prospect of breaking into or enlarging their shares of
the host country's market but by the presence of relatively cheap resources.

- 40

-

At the other end of the scale, affiliates in sbme non-commodity
industries—-public utilities, retail trade, and business and personal
services--concentrated heavily in their host-country markets.

Over the last quarter-century, the trend has been for affiliates to become
more export oriented. The share of exports in total sales more than doubled
for manufacturing affiliates. That is a substantial shift in orientation, but
it was not as large as the rise in the share of exports in GNP or in output of
goods in the U.S. and in other countries.

The export-orientation of affiliates varies by location as well as by
industry

Afffliates

in all industries combined were more export-oriented in developing

than in developed countries, partly because those in natural-resource

industries were large exporters, and partly because of the high ratios for the
Asia and Pacific countries. In manufacturing, the affiliates in Asia and Pacific countries exported over 40 per cent of their sales. Affiliates in Japan
and in Oceania were very inward-looking, perhaps because these countries had
comparatively protected markets.
For the most part, overseas affiliates have relied little on the U.S. as
a market, a little over 10 per cent of their sales in the two most recent
years for which we have data and a similar proportion twenty-five years
earlier. The unusually low share in 1966 and the exceptionally high U.S. share
in 1977 both reflected mainly the fluctuations of the petroleum industry.

aExdluding trade and finance
Source: Appendix Table 7
Affiliates in primary production——agriculture, mining, and petroleum
extraction--have, in general, been the most dependent on the U.S. market,

— 42 —

although the finance (except banking), insurance, and real estate group
entered that category in 1982. In the other broad industry groups, manufacturing, construction, public utilities and transportation, wholesale and
retail trade, and services, sales to the U.S. have ranged from less than one
per cent of affiliate sales to a little over 10 per cent.

If there has been any trend in some of the groups, it seems to be toward
an increasing dependence on the U.S. market. The largest jump was in the
finance group, as mentioned above, but there have been persistent increases in
manufacturing (more than a doubling of the share of sales to the U.S.) and,

over the last few years, a substantial one in wholesale trade. The rise of
almost 50 per cent in the dependence of manufacturing affiliates on the U.S.
market suggests the influence of the increasing exchange value of the dollar

in those years. It remains to be seen whether the reversal in exchange rates
will undo this shift in orientation.

A widely discussed trend in the character of direct investment by the
U.S. and by other countries has been the move toward shared ownership, and
particularly toward minority ownership, with majority shares in the hands of

citizens of the host country. The less developed countries, particularly in
Latin America, have promoted this trend. Restrictions on majority ownership
were written into the Andean Pact and into Mexican law.

Despite the pressure from host country governments, U.S. parent companies
have been more reluctant to share ownership in affiliates than companies from

other countries. Of the multinationals' affiliates surveyed in the Harvard
program that were established before 1951, 58 per cent of the U.S.—owned affiliates, 39 per cent of European affiliates, and 27 per cent of affiliates of

firms in other countries were wholly-owned. All these proportions had

— 43 —

decreased by the late 1960's to 46, 19, and 6 per cent, but the preference of
U.S. firms for 100 per cent ownership remains clear (OECD 1981, p. 50).
There has been some move by U.S. multinationals toward

sharing ownership.

The proportion of total affiliate sales made by majority-owned affiliates fell
from 88 per cent in 1966 to 77 per cent in 1982. The decline took place in the
first ten years of that period, however, and there was actually a small rise
between 1977 and 1982.

There are large differences among industries in the shares of majority-

owned affiliates, and the reduced share in the aggregate could represent
shifts among, as well as within, industries. It is clear, however (see

Appendix Table 8) that in all the major industry groups, the proportion of
sales by affiliates less than majority owned grew between 1966 and 1982 in
both developed countries and LDCs. The rise of these affiliates was important
in mining, retail trade, and public utilities and transportation, and in LDCs
they accounted for half or more of affiliate sales in these industries

by

1982. Thus, if the growth of these firms has been a response to hostcountries' efforts to gain substantial shares in the equity of foreign owned
affiliates, the efforts have met with some success.
One might expect that, given that technological or proprietary information is the basis for the competitive advantage of multinational firms, the
more important these factors were in an industry, the greater would be the
reluctance of parent companies to share these advantages and the stronger the
insistence on control or, preferably, total ownership of affiliates. it is
indeed the case that among manufacturing industries, those that rank high with
respect to spending on R & D are also among the ones with the highest shares
of majority ownership.

The only exception was electronic components and accessories in developed
countries, largely in Japan (a country in which less than 20 per cent of manufacturing affiliate sales are from majority—owned affiliates). In fact, in

these industries, the share of majority-owned affiliates actually increased
between 1977 and 1982, despite the decline in the majority-owned share in
manufacturing as a whole.

it is clear, then, that the policy of forcing shared ownership has not
been very successful for the LDCs in R & 0 intensive industries. The cost of
enforcing the policy may have been too great: a reduction in foreign investment in these industries and in the consequent transfer of technology.

4. The U.S. as a Recipient of ForeiQn Direct Investment
The Recent Growth of Foreign Direct Investment in the U.S.
During the 1960's, as U.S. direct investment in foreign countries was
reaching its peak rate of growth, hardly any of the world's flow of new
direct investment was coming to the United States.

From 1961 through 1967, less than 3 per cent of the flow to developed
countries came to the U.S., and in 1967 the U.S. was the location of less than
10 per cent of the

world stock of direct investment (Hood and Young 1979, 18,

and U.S. Bureau of the Census 1975, Series U-35). The U.S. share of inflows of
direct investment to developed countries rose to over 10 per cent in 1968-73,
and since then has been over 20 per cent in every year through 1983. It has
stayed over a third since 1978 and reached as high as two-thirds in 1981. The

U.S. share of inflows to all countries has been over a quarter since the late
1970s and reached a peak close to 50 per cent -in 1981. The U.S. has absorbed

more than all developing countries together since 1978 and usually more than
all the European countries combined.

With this large inflow of direct investment, the stock of foreign
direct investment in the U.S. has been growing very rapidly. One indication
of the growth is the comparison with assets of all U.S. corporations.

After staying around i per cent from 1950 through 1966, the ratio tripled
in the next 20 years, and more than doubled in the eight years from 1977 to
1985.

Another way of describing the growth of foreign direct investment in
the U.S. is by comparing it with U.S. investment abroad.

The greatest leap in foreign investment in the U.S. relative to U.S. investment abroad took place in the five years from 1977 to 1982 when foreign direct
investment grew from less than a quarter of U.S. direct investment abroad to
60 per cent of it, and the ratio has continued to increase rapidly since 1982.

Since these are book values, they are subject to the familiar doubts
about their meaning and comparability. The U.S. direct investments abroad are
much older, on average, than the foreign direct investments in the U.S. and
were made -in periods of much lower asset prices. It is therefore likely that

the use of book values understates the value of U.S. investments relative to
market values much more than it does the foreign investments. Thus, the extent
and growth of foreign investment in the U.S. relative to U.S. investment
abroad is probably considerably exaggerated in these figures.
Another fact that points to such a bias is the difference in income.
Despite the relatively small ostensible difference in the value of the stocks,
income on U.S. direct investment abroad was more than four times as large as

- 48

-

income on foreign direct investment in the U.S. in 1985 (U.S. Department of
Commerce 1986a and 1986b).

For the most recent decade or so, data on employment provide a measure
of foreign firms' participation in the U.S. economy that is free of the
effects of exchange rate changes and conversion methods. This measure too
demonstrates the rapid growth of foreign-owned operations, but also indicates
that their role in the U.S. economy as a whole remains small.

A point to keep in mind in comparing inward and outward direct investment
is that U.S. firms became multinational earlier than did most foreign firms
and probably reached something like an equilibrium stock of foreign assets by

the end of the 1960's. After that, there was not a large net movement of U.S.
firms into multinational status. Foreign firms, in contrast, have, for the
most part, become multinational fairly recently and are adding to their overseas operations rapidly because they have not reached the goals they have set.

One indication of the relative maturity in this sense of U.S. direct investment is that all (and more) of its growth came from reinvested earnings in

— 49 —

1984 and 1985, while most of the growth of other countriest direct investment
in the U.S. is from flows of new equity and debt.

U.S. parents were bringing some of their foreign assets back to the U.S.

by reducing equity and intercompany debt, while foreign companies were
increasing their holdings of U.S. assets far beyond their accumulation of
reinvested earnings.

Characteristics of Foreign—Owned Affiliates in the U.S.

The fact that the share of foreign-owned firms in U.S. employment was
still only about 3 1/2 per cent in 1985 might appear to deflate the anxieties

that have beer aroused by the inflow of direct investment. However, the
explanation for that concern lies in the concentration of the investment;

half of the employment in foreign-owned firms is in manufacturing, which
accounted for only about 15 per cent of total nonagricultural employment in
the U.S. in 1984 (Appendix Table 10).

Aside from mining, the ratios for which are affected seriously by

— 50 -

incomparabilities

between numerator and denominator, the greatest foreign

share in U.S. employment--7 per cent--is in manufacturing. That share almost
tripled in ten years.

Employment in foreign-owned manufacturing operations more than doubled
while total U.S. employment in manufacturing stayed about constant or even
declined a little.

Employment in foreign service affiliates rose at an even faster rate

than in goods production. However, in these industries U.S. total
employment was also rising, by about 50 per cent over 10 years. As a
result, although the foreign share increased, it did not grow as rapidly as
in manufacturing.

— 51 —

At the end of the period, among trade, finance, and services, it was
only in wholesale trade, probably closely tied to the distribution of
imported goods, that the share of employment in foreign—owned firms reached

5 per cent. In other groups the foreign share was under 3 per cent.
However, the ratios for finance, insurance, and real estate are

understated, because the data for foreign-owned firms omit banks. It does
seem clear, however, that foreign penetration of the service sectors was
relatively small.

Within manufacturing also, there were wide differences among industries

in the degree of foreign penetration. In 1984, almost 40 per cent of inanufacturing employment in the chemical industry was in foreign—owned firms,
while the proportions in other industries were all under 10 per cent.

The foreign share increased substantially in every group, at least

doubling within each industry. However, the ranking of the industries

changed at all. The greatest degree of foreign penetration was in

chemicals at the beginning and at the end of the period, followed by food
manufacturing industries, and there was a relatively small foreign

employment share in nonelectrical machinery in both periods. Thus the comparative advantages of foreign firms relative to U.S. firms seemed to
remain in the same industries.

The industry distribution of employment in foreign firms in 1984 was
much more concentrated in manufacturing and petroleum, and in goods producing industries as a group, than was U.S. employment in general, as can
be seen below.

The shares in trade and finance did not diverge as much from those of the U.S.
as a whole, especially if one takes account of the omission of banks from the

total of foreign holdings. However, the share of employment in foreign-owned
companies that was in service industries was less than a third of that for
U.S. firms.

The differences in the distributions reflect two influences. Foreign
firms may have had a comparative advantage in goods production and U.S.

- 54

firms

-

in service production. However, the results may also reflect dif-

ferences in the difficulty of carrying across national boundaries the com-

parative advantages of firms. Whatever gives firms a comparative advantage
or competitiveness in manufacturing industries, whether it is ownership of
patents on knowledge of production techniques or management abilities, may
be easier to move across national boundaries than the characteristics that

distinguish firms in trade and service industries. That might be because
of inherent characteristics of the two groups of industries or because
there are many more regulatory and similar obstacles placed in the path of
service industry producers than in the path of goods-producing companies.

Since entry into the U.S. market is relatively unrestricted and the share of
foreign firms in services is small, the suspicion that there are inherent
obstacles to service industry direct investment is reinforced.

The main trends in the industry distribution of foreign firms'

employment appear to move it toward the U.S. pattern. That is, the share
of mining and petroleum was declining, as was that; of manufacturing after

1977. The main increase in importance within foreign-owned companies was
in the service industries.

Sources of Foreign Direct Investment in the U.S.

As foreign direct investment has flowed into the U.S. in the last few
years there have been periodic alarms about increasing control of U.S.

industry by companies from the Middle East or Japan. Despite the publicized incidents of investments from these countries, the great bulk - 2/3
of the total -

of

foreign direct investment in the U.S. continues to be

controlled by European firms. Over 40 per cent of the foreign investment
is concentrated in two countries, the Netherlands and the U.K.

It should be mentioned that the identification of firms by nationality is
often uncertain. These ratios may well understate the ultimate Japanese and
Middle Eastern stake that is partly held through firms incorporated in Europe.
Data on U.S. direct investment abroad include investments by U.S. firms
controlled by foreigners and data on foreign direct investment in the U.S.
include investment by foreign firms controlled by U.S. parents. In the latter

case, however, the surveys include a classification by ultimate beneficial
ownership.

The shares of the different countries and areas vary from industry to

industry. Investment in the petroleum industry, for example is overwhelmingly

— 56 —

from Europe, over 80 per cent of the total from the Netherlands and the U.K.
(Appendix Table 11). Investment in manufacturing, the area that receives most

public attention, is also largely from Europe — about 3/4 -

but

several

countries participate, 9 per cent from France, 10 per cent from Germany, and
12 per cent form Switzerland, aside from the usual high proportion, over 40

per cent, from the Netherlands and the U.K. Japan accounts for less than 5
per cent of this investment.

Japan's investment is concentrated in wholesale trade. That investment is
more than half of Japan's total investment position in the U.S. and is more

than 40 per cent of total foreign direct investment in the industry. Japan
also plays a larger role in investment in U.S. banking--almost a fifth-—than
in the other industries.

Investment from Latin America, largely the Netherlands Antilles, is
more concentrated in the U.S. real estate industry that that from any other

source. More than a quarter of Latin America direct investment and that
from the Netherlands Antilles is in that industry and over a quarter of
total foreign direct investment in real estate is from Latin America, most
from the Netherlands Antilles.

The sources of the most recent growth in the foreign investment position in the U.S. do not suggest revolutionary changes in the pattern.

Europe accounted for 2/3 of the additions over the last five years, as it

did for the stock. The major change was that Japan was the source of 14
per cent of the additions, as compared to only 6 per cent of the 1980 stock

and the Netherlands and the U.K. less than 50 per cent of additions as corn—
pared with a share in the 1980 stock of almost 60 per cent. Within manufacturing, increases in investment from France were small relative to the
initial stock and those from Switzerland and

Japan were relatively large,

the latter from a very small base of only 3 per cent of total foreign
investment in manufacturing.

5. Portfolio Investment and Aggregate Investment Flows and Stocks
The capital account of the United States has gone through wide swings,

representing what appears to be an underlying evolution of the U.S. from

— 58 —

steady capital exporter in the 1960s to the world's major capital importer in
the mid—1980s. The major element of the U.S. capital outflow in the first
decade was the steadily growing direct investment flow to foreign countries,

averaging about $4 billion per year.

Source: Appendix Table 12
That trend of direct investment was not interrupted in the next few years, but
it was outweighed in 1971 and 1972 by the monetary troubles of the United
States, reflected in the additions to foreign official holdings in the U.S. of
over $183 billion a year and, until the devaluation of the dollar, by the

running down of foreign deposits in U.S. banks.
The next ten years were turbulent, including the two oil price shocks
and two U.S. recessions that were severe by post—World War II standards.
U.S. direct investment abroad continued to grow and accounted for capital

export averaging about $12i billion a year, but it was reduced severely by
the 1982 recession and did not recover to earlier levels until 1985.

However, a new element entered the picture in this decade: foreign lending
by U.S. banks at the rate of over $37 billion a year, dwarfing the direct

- 59

—

investment that had been dominant in the 1960s. As U.S. banks lent

abroad,

they also absorbed deposits from abroad that were far larger than in earlier

years, averaging over $20 billion a year. While the two series were not perfectly synchronized, the bank lending and bank borrowing did move more or less

in step, as U.S. banks acted as intermediaries between the countries accumulating assets and those absorbing them. The inflow of capital to the U.S.
also included large additions to foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury securities
and, beginning in the late 1970s, large direct investment flows to the U.S.
The next few years were to see a spectacular reversal of the U.S.

position. U.S. bank lending, which had averaged over $37 billion a year in
the 1973-82 decade and over $80 billion a year in 1980-82 dropped to under

a billion dollars in 1985. At the same time, U.S. bank borrowing from
abroad, which had averaged a little over $20 billion a year during 1973-82
and almost $40 billion in 1980—82, continued to average over $40 billion in

1983-85. Thus, the U.S. was absorbing foreign capital through U.S. banks,
through foreign purchases of Treasury securities, and through foreign purcha—
ses of other U.S. securities.

In this case too, the industrial countries have been the main sources of

The rest of the U.S. borrowing, about a fifth, came mainly from the developing countries of Latin America and Asia.

Changes in foreign official assets in the U.S. were relatively small on

Since the collapse of oil prices OPEC countries have been drawing down
reserves in the U.S. while the industrial countries and the developing
countries have been increasing them. In contrast, -in the four years before,
OPEC countries had been increasing their official reserve holdings in the
U.S. by almost $10 billion a year and the industrial countries had been

reducing theirs just about as fast. In the years after the first oil shock
all three groups of countries were adding to the official reserves held in
the U.S.

The collapse of U.S. bank lending during the last three years includes
very different behavior toward industrial and developing countries.

Lending to developed countries changed little, but with respect to the
developing countries of Latin America and Asia the U.S. turned from net
lending to net repayment of debt.

Over longer periods, the concentration of the growth of debt in a very

few years becomes evident. Almost two thirds of the total since the first
oil shock was extended during 1981 and 1982, and that pattern was repeated in
almost all the borrowing countries.

6. Summary

The United States has gone through several cycles in the state of its

foreign investment account. It was a borrower and international debtor
before World War I, first a lender and then a refuge for foreign capital
between the wars, the world's major lender and creditor after World War II,
and, in the last few years, a borrower again, and, according to the offi-

cial accounts, even a net debtor. Most foreign investment in the U.S. has

— 65 -

always been portfolio investment, although direct investment has been
growing rapidly -in recent years, while most U.S. investment abroad has

typically been direct investment. The major episodes of foreign portfolio
investment by the U.S. have not been happy ones. One was the -intergovernment lending during World War I, eventually written off. A second was the
burst of lending to Latin America -in the late 1920s, a good part of which

ended in default. And the third was the large international lending of the
period after the first oil crisis, much of which is of questionable
standing now.

The long period of U.S. borrowing before 1900 does not seem to have

brought enough foreign capital into the U.S. for the transfer of resources
involved to have made a great difference in the long run growth of the

country. The role of the foreign capital appears to have been that of
accommodating capital needs for sharp bursts -in U.S. growth or in the

growth of particular sectors, especially capital-intensive ones, until

domestic saving caught up with capital formation. If the irregularity of
capital requirements was an intrinsic feature of rapid growth, the inflow
of foreign capital was more important than its size would indicate.
U.S. direct investment abroad began while the U.S. was still an

overall borrower and debtor, as the technological leaders among U.S. manufacturing firms pioneered in the technique of exploiting their firm advantages by producing in other countries. The major expansion -in U.S. direct
investment took place in the 1950s and 1960s, as U.S. firms took advantage
of the great advances in communication and transportation to spread their

production activities around the world. The peak in the stock of foreign
assets relative to domestic assets was probably reached during the early

- 66

-

1970s, although the share of their exports that multinational U.S. manufacturing firms produced abroad continued to increase after that.

The bulk of U.S. direct investment abroad has always been in goods

production. However, there was a brief period in the 1920s in which almost
all of U.S. investment in public utilities was concentrated, presumably a
reflection of the U.S. lead in telephone systems and electric power production

and distribution. Within the production of goods there has been a shift away
from primary production, between a third and a half of the total in the 1950s,

to manufacturing, which reached its peak share in the late 1960s or early

1970s. Since then there has been growth in the trade and services sector, the
share of which roughly doubled between the mid-1950s and the mid-1980s and

reached almost a third of total direct investment. Most of this is in wholesale trade and finance, with other services, even including oil-field services, still less than 5 per cent of U.S. direct investment abroad in 1985.
Using foreign production to retain their competitiveness in world
markets, U.S. multinational manufacturing firms have been able to retain a
constant share of world exports of manufactures over the last 15 or 20

years, while the share of the U.S. as a country has fallen sharply. What
sustained the share of U.S. multinationals was the growth in their exports
from locations outside the U.S., to the point that almost half of their
exports now originate from their foreign production.

The comparative advantage of both the U.S. and its multinational firms
is concentrated in chemicals, machinery, and transport equipment, to judge

by export performance. The multinationals' share is large relative to
that of the U.S. in chemicals, electrical machinery, and transport equipment, but the share of the U.S as a country is greater -in non—electrical

— 67 —

machinery.

Among more narrowly defined industries, the multinationals'

comparative advantage is strongest in industries with heavy investments in

advertising and in R&D. R&D intensity, a major explanation of the comparative advantage of the U.S. as a country, explains the comparative
advantage of U.S. multinationals to an even greater degree.

Over the last quarter-century u.s. affiliates in foreign countries
have changed their operations in several respects. One is that they have

become more oriented to exporting and another is that they have become more

dependent on the U.S. market. However, they still sell mainly in their
host-country markets, and what they do export goes mainly to countries

other than the U.S. Exports to the U.S. market are only 14 per cent of
their total sales.

There has been an increase in the proportion of affiliates in which
parents own less than a majority share, although that trend has at least

slowed. Affiliates in the most technologically advanced industries continue to be majority-owned in most cases, presumably because sharing of

ownership would erode the very advantages that make direct investment profitable.

While the flow of direct investment from the U.S. has slowed, there
has recently been a large inflow of foreign direct investment into the
U.S., roughly tripling the share of foreign-owned companies in the U.S.
since 1950, doubling it in the last decade, and reaching to about three
quarters of the value of U.S. investment abroad if those book value figures

are taken literally. They probably exaggerate the size of inward direct
investment relative to outward investment because so much of the inward
investment has occurred in recent years.

- 68

—

While foreign-owned firms accounted for only about 3 per cent of
total U.S. employment after all the recent growth in foreign investment,

the shares in manufacturing and wholesale trade were considerably higher.
Within manufacturing there was also considerable variation, with foreign
firms accounting for almost 40 per cent of chemical industry employment,

but in all the other industries for less than 10 per cent. The foreign
shares in service industries, aside from wholesale trade, increased, but

remained below 3 per cent. To some extent, these figures reflect U.S. comparative advantage in service industry production, but the fact that U.S.
companies' direct investment in foreign service industries is not itself very
large suggests that it may be difficult to carry firm advantages in these
industries across national borders.

The sources of these foreign investment flows into the U.S. continue
to be mainly European countries, particularly the UK and the Netherlands.
However, there has been some increase in the flow from Japan, mainly into

wholesale trade. Most of that is probably connected with exporting from
and importing to Japan rather than with wholesale trading among U.S. companies.

Aside from the increased flow of direct investment into the U.S. in
recent years, there have been major shifts in the U.S. international capital

position stemming largely from changes in portfolio investment. The United
States became a very large capital importer in 1983-85 as U.S. banks
reduced their net lending to insignificant amounts overall and foreign
countries added greatly to their holdings not only of direct investment but
also of U.S. Treasury securities, other U.S. securities, and deposits in

U.S. banks. Most of the flows have been from Europe, as in the case of

— 69 —

direct

investment, but Japan has also become an important investor, par-

ticularly in U.S. Treasury securities.

The growth of U.S. bank claims on foreigners was concentrated in a
very short period after the second rise in oil prices, with most

being

accumulated in 1981 and 1982. That concentration is unpleasantly reminiscent of the concentration of portfolio investment in the late 1920s, but
there has already been a substantial reduction in those claims in 1985
alone.
