ABSTRACT
We conduct a randomized evaluation of two job-search support programs for urban youth in
Ethiopia. One group of treated respondents receives a subsidy to cover the transport costs of job
search. Another group participates in a job application workshop where their skills are certified
and they are given orientation on how to make effective job applications. The two interventions
are designed to lower spatial and informational barriers to employment. We find that both
treatments significantly improve the quality of jobs that young jobseekers obtain. Impacts are
concentrated among women and the least educated. Using rich high-frequency data from a phone
survey, we are able to explore the mechanisms underlying the results; we show that while the
transport subsidy increases both the intensity and the efficacy of job search, the job application
workshop mainly operates through an increase in search efficacy. Both interventions mitigate the
adverse effects of spatial constraints on employment outcomes, and the job application workshop
alleviates informational asymmetries by helping workers to signal their ability.

Introduction

Over half of the world’s population lives in a city and global urbanisation is proceeding at
a rapid pace, especially in developing countries. By 2050, the urban population of Africa
is expected to triple, while that of Asia is expected to grow by 61 percent (United Nations,
2014). A key challenge for policy makers is to find ways to support a growing urban labour
force, and in particular those workers who find it hardest to access the opportunities that
cities have to offer. These individuals tend to be young and are predominantly female.
They have left school after completing compulsory education, they have little work experience, and they live in poorly connected parts of the city. A growing literature argues that
their labor market opportunities are reduced by the cost of job search and their inability to
signal skills during the recruitment process (Card et al., 2007; Chetty, 2008; Crépon et al.,
2013; Pallais, 2014). Limited labour market opportunities can reduce well-being, depreciate human capital, and change preferences (Clark and Oswald, 1994; Fisman et al., 2015).
Search frictions also affect competition between firms and distort the allocation of labour
(Kaas and Kircher, 2015; Bryan and Morten, 2015). Yet, despite the importance of these
effects, we have surprisingly little evidence documenting how job search constraints can be
addressed in the growing cities of developing economies.
In this paper, we experimentally evaluate two interventions that are designed to help
young urban dwellers search for employment. The first intervention is a transport subsidy.
Job search in our study area requires regular trips to the centre of town and we calibrate
the subsidy amount to cover the cost of this journey. Individuals who are offered this
program can collect the subsidy from an office located in the centre of the city, up to
three times a week, for an average period of 16 weeks. The second intervention is a job
application workshop. Participants are offered orientation on how to make effective job
applications using CVs and cover letters and on how to approach job interviews. Further,
during the event, participants take a mix of standardised personnel selection tests. We use
information from the tests to certify participants’ general skills. These two interventions are
designed to ease spatial and informational constraints to job search. We hypothesised that
treated jobseekers would search more intensely and more effectively, leading to improved
3

employment outcomes.
We evaluate these interventions using a random sample of about 4,000 young individuals in a rapidly expanding metropolis located in a fast growing country – namely, Addis
Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia. This location is ideal for our purpose: a large city with
a total population close to 4 million people, unemployment rates above 20 percent, many
insecure and poorly paid jobs, and rapid in-migration from outlying rural areas. Because
of our interest in search costs related to transport, we focus on subjects who reside at least
2.5 km away from the centre of town.1
We find that both interventions help jobseekers get better jobs. Eight months after
the end of the program, individuals invited to the job application workshop are nearly 40
percent more likely to have permanent employment and nearly 25 percent more likely to be
in formal employment compared to individuals in the control group. Individuals who are
offered the transport subsidy are 25 percent more likely to be in formal employment. These
effects are statistically significant; they are robust to a correction for multiple comparisons;
and their magnitude is economically meaningful. The effects are stronger for women and
for less educated workers (those who have at most secondary education). These are the
groups that typically find it hardest to obtain high quality employment, in Ethiopia and in
other developing countries (OECD, 2015).
To understand the mechanisms that drive these results, we conduct fortnightly phone
interviews with all sampled jobseekers throughout the course of the study. This provides a
rich, high-frequency dataset that allows us to observe how search behaviour evolves in response to our interventions.2 We find that the transport subsidy allows jobseekers to search
more intensely. Furthermore, we find that both interventions improve jobseekers’ search
efficacy, particularly for the least educated. On average, control individuals with a high
school degree receive an offer for a permanent job every 10.5 applications. The workshop
and the transport programs bring this down to about one offer every 5.2 applications.

Individuals included in the study are between 18 and 29 years of age, have completed high school, are
available to take up employment, and are not currently working in a permanent job.
Recall bias would make it difficult to perform a similar analysis using retrospective questions asked in the
endline survey.

We also present evidence consistent with the hypothesis that the interventions work by
easing spatial and informational constraints. In particular, both interventions weaken the
correlation between distance from the city centre and the type of occupation that participants undertake. Furthermore, using data from the personnel selection tests, we find that
the job application workshop strengthens the correlation between skills and good employment outcomes for workers with less formal qualifications. We present evidence from a
regression discontinuity analysis suggesting that this effect is mostly driven by the orientation component of the job application workshop.
Finally, we measure the indirect impacts of the interventions on the young individuals
who reside close to program participants. Using a randomised saturation design, we find
some positive indirect effects of the transport subsidy on the quality of employment when
the proportion of treated jobseekers is low, and some negative effects when the proportion
of treated jobseekers is high (90 %). We do not find indirect effects of the job application
workshop, despite a fairly high proportion of treated respondents in all clusters (80 %).
Taken together, our evidence shows that the urban unemployed can benefit from simple
interventions that facilitate job search, at least in the context of least developed countries
where the problem is particularly acute. Recent studies have documented that search subsidies and information can connect rural workers to urban jobs (Jensen, 2012; Bryan et al.,
2014). We show that job search assistance can also be effective for workers in urban labour
markets.
There is little experimental evidence documenting the impacts of transportation subsidies and jobseekers’ orientation interventions. Using a randomized field experiment in
Washington DC, Phillips (2014) finds that a public transit subsidy has a large, short-run
effect in reducing unemployment durations, with treatment causing the probability of finding employment within 40 days to increase by 9 percentage points, from 0.26 to 0.35. After
90 days, this difference narrows to a large but statistically insignificant 5 percentage points.
For less developed countries, Franklin (2015) reports the results of an early trial of a transport subsidy intervention administered to a selected sample of motivated jobseekers in
Addis Ababa. He also finds positive impacts on the probability of permanent work. Groh

5

et al. (2015, 2016) find that a soft skills training program and a matching intervention do
not improve the employment outcomes of young Jordanian women. These two interventions have a number of features in common with the job application workshop – chiefly, the
focus on information about skills. However, they are offered to a sample of jobseekers with
tertiary education, in a labour market with much higher unemployment rates. In line with
their results, we are unable to find significant treatment effects for individuals with tertiary
education, but we find that this type of intervention can benefit less educated workers.
More generally, our results contribute to our understanding of how space affects the
functioning of labour markets (Gollin and Rogerson, 2010; Bryan and Morten, 2015; Asher
and Novosad, 2015). We sample young individuals who reside in many different parts of
Addis Ababa and we record detailed geo-coded information about their place of residence.
This allows us to document the spatial pattern of occupational structure in the city and
to calculate heterogeneous treatment effects by distance from the city centre. We find that
both our interventions help jobseekers overcome the spatial constraints on occupational
choices.
We also contribute to a growing literature that studies the economic importance of
cognitive and non-cognitive skills (Bowles et al., 2001; Heckman et al., 2006; Blattman et al.,
2015). We draw from this literature to develop the personnel selections tests used in the
study. Our evidence suggests that in some segments of the labour market employers may
be unable to identify highly skilled workers. The job application workshop overcomes this.
Our results relate directly to the findings in Pallais (2014), who documents the positive
employment effects of an interventions that helps workers signal their skills in an online
labour market.
Finally, we provide the first evidence on the local indirect effects of labour market
interventions in a developing country. Using a randomised saturation design as in Crépon
et al. (2013), we show that indirect effects on non-participants depend on the proportion of
jobseekers that are offered the program in a given area.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides some information

6

about the labour market in Addis Ababa. Section 3 describes the two interventions. In
section 4, we introduce the experimental design, the data we use, and the main empirical
specification. Section 4 presents the main results. In section 5, we discuss the nature of the
constraints addressed by our interventions. We conclude with some thoughts about future
interventions.

Context

Addis Ababa is the largest city in Ethiopia (African Economist, 2012). Official estimates
suggest that the population of the city totalled 3.2 millions in 2014 and planners expect
that Addis Ababa’s population will more than double in the next 25 years (CSA, 2014;
Davison, 2014).3 Many of the city residents are unemployed. The overall unemployment
rate is 23.5 percent.4 Young people between the age of 20 and 29 face an unemployment
rate of 27.9 percent, and young women a rate of 33.6 percent (CSA, 2014). Furthermore,
available jobs are often insecure and poorly paid. At the time of the endline survey of our
study, only 30 percent of the employed individuals in the control group have a permanent
job. The others work in temporary, casual or self-employment. The stream of income from
these occupations is unstable. For example, 25 percent of temporary workers report that
they had to miss at least one week of work, since they started their current job, because
"work was not available".5 Working poverty is widespread: two workers out of five earn
less than 2 USD per day.6
Job search is costly for unemployed youth. One of the most popular search methods
3
4

6

Other estimates suggest that the total population of the city is close to 4.5 million.
To calculate this rate, the Central Statistical Authority of Ethiopia counts as unemployed all individuals who
do not have a job, but are available for work.
The median duration of these spells was 4 weeks for temporary workers and 8 weeks for the self-employed.
Median earnings in the control group at endline are about 70 USD per month. If we adjust this figure using
the World Bank purchasing power parity conversion rates, this corresponds to about 205 USD. However,
Addis Ababa is the most expensive city in Ethiopia. Thus when we use the nation-wide PPP adjustment
factor we overestimate the real purchasing power of salaries in the capital city. Data from the Ethiopian
Statistical Authority documents that in 2014 2 employed individuals out of 5 in Addis Ababa were available
to work additional hours, further suggesting underemployment and low pay.

7

used by the participants in our study is to visit the job vacancy boards.7 The boards are
located in the centre of the city, forcing participants who live in the periphery to travel
frequently to the centre of the city, which can be costly. Job seekers also face the costs of
gathering information through newspapers, printing CVs and cover letters, travelling to
interviews, etc. Among the active searchers in our sample, the median expenditure on job
search at baseline amounts to about 16 percent of overall expenditure. This goes up to
25 percent for jobseekers who report searching 6 days a week. These are large amounts
especially if we consider that the typical jobseeker spends a long time in unemployment
before finding a job. In our baseline sample, for example, the median jobseekers has spent
about 10 months looking for employment.
Young jobseekers in Addis Ababa find it hard to signal their skills and worth to employers. To select a shortlist of candidates among a large number of applicants, firms in the
city often use simple criteria such as whether the candidate has previous work experience.8
Job referrals are also frequent (Serneels, 2007; Caria, 2015). This puts young people at a
disadvantage, as they have little work experience and less extensive networks. 55 percent
of the participants in our study report having less than one year of work experience and
only 16 percent have ever worked in a permanent job. Furthermore, many jobseekers do
not seem to be familiar with the process and the standards of job applications. For example, while firms report valuing a well-written CV, 41 percent of the study participants who
have applied for at least one job in the last six months have not prepared a CV to support
their applications.
In light of these challenges, we devised three interventions to support young unemployed workers in their job-search. This paper focuses on the first two treatments. The
third one, which is briefly described in Section 2.4, will be the focus of a separate paper.

8

At baseline, 36 percent of participants rank the job vacancy boards as their preferred method of search and
53 percent of active searchers have visited the boards at least once in the previous seven days.
56 percent of firms report that for blue collar positions they only consider candidates with sufficient work
experience, and 63 percent of firms use this selection method for white collar positions.

The interventions

3.1

Treatment 1: The transport subsidy

Individuals in this treatment group are offered cash conditional on attending an office in
the centre of Addis Ababa.9 Recipients are required to attend in person, and to show
photographic ID on each visit. Each recipient can collect cash once a day, up to three times
a week. The amount that can be collected on any given day is calibrated to cover the cost of
a return bus fare from the area of residence of the participant at baseline to the intervention
office.

10

The median subsidy available on a given day is equal to 20 Ethiopian Birr (1 USD at the
exchange rate at the beginning of the intervention). This is about two thirds of the median
weekly expenditure on job search at baseline, and 10 percent of overall weekly expenditure.
The minimum amount is 15 ETB (0.75 USD) and the maximum 30 ETB (1.5 USD).
We stagger the start time and the end time of the subsidy, randomly. This generates
variation across individuals in the number of weeks during which the treatment was available, and in the time of treatment. The number of weeks of treatment varied from 13 to 20,
with a median of 16 weeks. We implement the intervention between September 2014 and
January 2015.

3.2

Treatment 2: The job application workshop

The job application workshop is designed to help jobseekers signal their skills to employers.
It has two components: an orientation session and a testing session. The orientation session
helps jobseekers make more effective use of their existing signals (job experience, educa9
10

This office is located close to the major job vacancy boards. The office was also near a central bus station,
from which buses leave to destinations all around Addis Ababa.
We calibrate the subsidy to allow participants to travel on minibuses. Study participants can in principle
walk to the office or use less expensive large public buses – an inferior means of transport that is crowded
and infrequent – and save a part of the transfer. Qualitative evidence suggests that this is not common.
Furthermore, we do not find that individuals in this treatment group increase their savings during the
weeks of the intervention.

tion, etc.). In the testing session, we certify skills that are "hard to observe" for employers,
such as cognitive ability, and we provide participants with an instrument (the certificates)
to signal those skills.
The intervention takes place over two days. On the first day, participants take the tests.
On the second day, they attend the orientation session. The intervention is administered
by the School of Commerce of Addis Ababa University, between September and October
2014. The School of Commerce has a reputation for reliable personnel selection services
and many firms screen their applicants using tests developed, and sometimes administered
by, the School of Commerce. In a survey of 500 medium to large firms in Addis Ababa,
we find that about 40 percent of firms know about the personnel selection services offered
by the School of Commerce (Abebe et al., 2015). 80 percent of these firms report that they
trust the services offered by the School of Commerce.
The orientation session covers three main topics: CV writing, application letters and
job interviews. All the training materials were developed by the School of Commerce
and later reviewed by our team. We administer four tests: (i) a Raven matrices test, (ii)
a test of linguistic ability in Amharic, (iii) a test of mathematical ability and (iv) a ‘worksample’ test. The results of the tests are presented in a certificate, which jobseekers can
use in support of their job applications. The certificates explain the nature of the tests
and report the relative grade of the individual for each test, and an aggregate measure of
performance.11 The certificates are officially issued by the School of Commerce and the
Ethiopian Development Research Institute.12
We chose the tests on the basis of the results of several qualitative interviews with firm
managers in the city.13 The Raven test is a widely used measure of cognitive ability (Raven,
2000). It is believed to be one of the best predictors of worker productivity (Schmidt and
Hunter, 1998; Chamorro-Premuzic and Furnham, 2010) and it has been used by economists
11

12
13

We report relative performance using bands: a band for the bottom 50 percent of the distribution and then
separate bands for individuals in the upper deciles of the distribution: 50-60%, 60-70%, 70-80%, 80-90%,
90-100%.
Participants collect the final certificates from the School of Commerce, after all testing sessions are completed.
These interviews highlights managers’ information needs and the degree of familiarity that managers have
with various tests.

10

to measure worker quality in several contexts (Dal Bó et al., 2013; Beaman et al., 2013). The
tests of mathematical and linguistic ability are designed to capture general mathematical
and linguistic skills, as in the OECD’s PIAAC survey or the World Bank’s STEP survey
(OECD, 2013; Pierre et al., 2014). The ‘work-sample’ test captures participants’ ability to
carry out simple work tasks: taking minutes during a business meeting, carrying out a
data entry task under time pressure, and meeting a deadline to complete a data entry task
at home. The literature in organisational psychology suggests that ‘work-sample’ tests can
be used alongside measures of cognitive ability to predict worker performance (Schmidt
and Hunter, 1998).

3.3

Job fair

Alongside the two treatments that we study in the paper, we also implemented a third
intervention. Individuals assigned to this treatment, were invited to attend, free of charge
a job fair. This is a distinct treatment, which we plan to evaluate in a separate paper.

Experimental design and data

4.1

The sample

We randomise treatment assignment at two levels: geographic clusters and individuals.
We defined geographic clusters using the Ethiopian Central Statistical Agency (CSA) enumeration areas.14 Our sampling frame excluded clusters within 2.5 km of the centre of
Addis Ababa, and clusters outside the city boundaries. Clusters were selected at random
from our sampling frame, with the condition that directly adjacent clusters could not be
selected, to minimise potential spill-over effects across clusters.
In each selected cluster, we used door-to-door sampling to construct a list of all individuals in the cluster who: (i) were 18 or older, but younger than 30; (ii) had completed
14

CSA defines enumeration areas as small, non-overlapping geographical areas. In urban areas, these typically
consist of 150 to 200 housing units.

11

high school; (iii) were available to start working in the next three months; and (iv) were
not currently working in a permanent job or enrolled in full time education. We randomly
sampled individuals from this list to be included in the study. Our lists included individuals with different levels of education. We sampled with higher frequency from the groups
with higher education. This ensured that individuals with vocational training and university degrees are well represented in the study. All selected individuals were contacted for
an interview.
We completed baseline interviews with 4388 eligible respondents. We attempted to contact individuals by phone for at least a month (three months, on average); we dropped individuals who could not be reached after at least three attempted calls.15 We also dropped
any individual who had found a permanent job and who retained the job for at least six
weeks. Finally, we dropped individuals who had migrated away from Addis Ababa during the phone survey. Table 8 in the online appendix shows of how many individuals were
dropped from the sample at each point and the reasons for them being dropped. In all we
were left with 4059 individuals who were are included in our experimental study.

4.2

Face-to-face interviews and the phone survey

We collect data on study participants through both face-to-face and phone interviews. We
complete baseline face-to-face interviews between May and July 2014 and endline interviews between June and August 2015. We collect information about the sociodemographic
characteristics of study participants, their education, work history, finances and their expectations and attitudes. We also include a module to study social networks.
We also construct a rich, high-frequency panel dataset through fortnightly phone interviews. We call all study participants through the duration of the study. In these interviews
we administer a short questionnaire focused on job search and employment. Franklin
(2015) shows that high-frequency phone surveys of this type do not generate Hawthorne
15

We give details of the phone interviews in section 4.2 below

effects, for example, they do not affect jobseekers’ responses during the endline interview.

4.3

Randomisation

We randomly assigned geographic clusters to one of five treatment groups: (i) control, (ii)
transport, (iii) job application workshop, (iv) job fair, (v) job fair and workshop. To ensure
balance, we created blocks of clusters with similar baseline observables and randomly
assigned clusters within each block to the five groups (Bruhn and McKenzie, 2009).16
Not all individuals in the clusters assigned to the transport intervention and job application workshop were designated to receive treatment. Among those in the transport
clusters, we implemented a randomised saturation design. We varied the proportion of
sampled individuals who were offered treatment from 20% to 40%, 75% and 90%. Table 2 shows the number of clusters assigned to each saturation level and the number of
individuals who were offered treatment in those clusters.
In clusters assigned to the job application workshop we kept the level of saturation
fixed. 80% of all individuals in these clusters were invited to attend the workshop. Having set cluster saturation levels, we assigned individuals within clusters to treatment and
controls. This was done by blocking individuals within clusters by their education level,
and implementing a simple re-randomisation rule. The final assignment to treatment is
outlined in Table 1. Finally, individuals designated to receive the transport intervention
were randomly assigned to a start and an end week. This is illustrated in table 9 in the
online appendix.

< Table 1 here. >

< Table 2 here. >
16

We used the following variables to create the blocks: distance of cluster centroid from city centre; total
sample size surveyed in the cluster; total number of individuals with degrees; total number of individuals
with vocational qualifications; total number of individuals who have worked in the last 7 days; total number
of individuals who have searched for work in the last 7 days; total number of individuals of Oromo ethnicity;
average age of individuals in the cluster.

13

4.4

Balance and Attrition

We find that our sample is balanced across all treatment and control groups, and across a
wide range of outcomes. This includes outcomes that were not used in the randomisation
procedure. We present extensive balance tests in Table 10 in the online appendix. For each
baseline outcome of interest, we report the p-values for a test of the null hypothesis that all
experimental groups are balanced. We cannot reject this null for any of variables that we
study.
Attrition in our sample is low, especially compared to other studies of young adults
in Sub-Saharan Africa (Baird et al., 2011; Blattman et al., 2013). In the endline survey, we
find 93.5% of all participants. The probability of tracking original study participants is
very similar across experiment groups. We cannot reject the null hypothesis that there are
no differences in attrition rates between treatment and control individuals when we study
each treatment individually, or when we run a joint test for all treatments. A number
of covariates predict attrition. Since neither these variables, nor attrition, are correlated
with treatment, we are not worried that this is affecting our results. Table 11 in the online
appendix presents the analysis of attrition.
Attrition in the phone survey is also low, below 5% in the early months of the calls.
We find that while attrition increases in the later week of the study, we are still able to
contact more than 90% of respondents in the final month of the phone survey. Figure 19 in
the online appendix shows the trajectory of monthly attrition rates over the course of the
phone survey.17

4.5

Take-up

50% of individuals in the transport group collect the cash at least once. Of these, 19% do
not return to collect the subsidies again. Those who collected the subsidies for at least
17

We do not report attrition rates at the very beginning of the phone survey since many respondents were
only contacted for the first time in months 2 and 3 of the phone survey, either because they were surveyed
towards the end of the baseline survey, and because of lags in setting up the phone survey.

14

two weeks tended to be dedicated users. Conditional on coming to take up the money at
least, 74% of respondents took up the money at least once a week over the course of the
entire study. The average number of total collections among those who took it up was 16,
corresponding to an average cash transfer of 320 ETB (15 USD) per active user, or 160 ETB
(7.5 USD) per intended user.
63% of individuals in the job application workshop group attended the workshop. 80%
of those attending later collected the certificates from the School of Commerce. Not all
of these jobseekers chose to use the certificates to support their job applications. Among
the study participants who collected the certificates and applied to at least one position,
42 percent report ever including the certificates in an application.18 When they did so,
participants report that the firms took the information into consideration.

Empirical strategy

We follow a detailed pre-analysis plan registered at: www.socialscienceregistry.org/
trials/911. The plan describes the empirical strategy, the outcome variables of interest, the
definition of these variables, the subgroup analysis, and our approach to multi-hypothesis
testing and attrition.
Our primary objective is to estimate the effects of the programs on the labour market
outcomes of study participants. For each outcome at endline, we will estimate the following
equation:
yic = β 0 + β 1 · transporti + β 2 · workshopi + β 3 · jobfairi

+ γ1 · spillover1i + γ2 · spillover2i + α · yic,pre + δ · xi0 + µic

(1)

where yic is the endline outcome for individual i in cluster c and xi0 is the vector of
baseline covariate values that were used for re-randomisation and blocking. transporti ,
18

This is unlikely to be caused by poor understanding, as participants report to have understood the information presented in the certificates well and certificates use is correlated with the score reported.

15

workshopi , jobfairi are dummies that capture whether an individual has been offered a
particular program.19 Thus, our estimates measure the intent-to-treat impacts of the interventions. In this paper we focus on the effects of the transport and job application
workshop. As discussed, the effects of the job fair intervention will be reported in a separate paper. spillover1i identifies control individuals residing in clusters assigned to the
transport treatment, while spillover2i identifies control individuals in clusters assigned
to the job application workshop. We correct standard errors to allow for correlation within
geographical clusters. As we explained above, we sampled individuals who have attained
high education levels with higher frequency. To obtain average treatment effects for the
population of eligible individuals, we weight observations according to the inverse of the
probability of being sampled.20
In the pre-analysis plan, we specify a family of seven primary employment outcomes.
For each one of them we we test the null hypothesis that each treatment had no impact.
We report both a conventional p-value and a ‘sharpened’ q-value (Benjamini et al., 2006).
The q-values control the false discovery rate within the family of the seven hypotheses
that we test for each program. We also specify two families of intermediate outcomes
that help us elucidate what mechanisms drive the primary effects, and seven families of
secondary outcomes. To deal with secondary outcomes, we will use a standard ‘omnibus’
approach: we construct an index for each family and test whether the index is affected by
our treatments. For inference, we proceed as before: we report both p values and false
discovery rate q-values by treating each index as a separate member of a ‘super-family’ of
indices.

We administered two different versions of the job fairs treatment. We follow the pre-analysis plan and
include a separate dummy for each version of the job fair treatment. For simplicity of exposition, in equation
1 we collapse the two dummies into one. Since the effects of the job fairs will be the focus of a separate
paper, they will not be reported below.
We use the sampling weights reported in the pre-analysis plan.

Results

We first present the impacts of each program on the primary employment outcomes. Table 3 summarises the results. Each row in the table corresponds to an outcome variable.
We study impacts on overall employment rates, on the number of hours worked and on
the probability of having a permanent job and a job with a written agreement. In Ethiopia,
workers are often employed without a written agreement, which makes it difficult for them
to uphold their formal rights and for the fiscal authority to collect labour taxes.21 Thus,
having a written agreement represents a salient measure of employment formality. We also
test for effects on the probability of being self employed, on earnings and work satisfaction. The first two columns of table 3 report impacts on treated individuals. Columns 3
and 4 show impacts on control individuals in treated clusters (the indirect effects of the
programs). Below each coefficient we report a p-value in parentheses and a q-value in
brackets. The mean outcome for the control group at endline is shown in column 5. In
column 6 we report the results of an F-test for the equality of the effects of the two interventions.

< Table 3 here. >

We find that both interventions significantly improve the quality of the jobs workers
get. The application workshop increases the probability of working in a permanent job
by nearly 40 percent (raising the share of workers in permanent employment by 6.7 percentage points from a level of 17.1 percent in the control group). The effect is statistically
significant at the 1 percent level and remains highly significant after correcting for multiple
comparisons. The transport treatment boosts permanent employment by nearly 20 percent
(a 3.4 percentage points increase from the control level). This effect is significant at the 10
percent level, but has a q-value of 0.23 once we account for multiple comparisons. Both
21

In the endline survey of our study, only 44 percent of workers have signed a written agreement with their
employer. Those who do are 60 percent less likely to report delays in wage payments and 22 percent more
likely to have received information about health and safety regulations. Furthermore, workers with a written
agreement are less likely to be working in small shops, construction sites and open markets (locations that
are prone to informality), and more likely to be working in an office or a factory.

effects are also robust to the use of Lee bounds to correct for attrition.22 We report these
bounds in table 25 of the online appendix.
We also find that both interventions increases workers’ chances to have a formal job
(proxied by a written contract) by nearly 25 percent. Only 22 percent of the control group
has a formal job at endline and both programmes increase that figure by 5 percentage
points. The effects are robust to the multiple comparison correction and to the use of Lee
bounds to correct for attrition.
The interventions have modest and insignificant effects on the overall employment rate
of treated individuals. About 56 percent of controls are engaged in some form of work
at endline. This goes up by an insignificant 4 percentage points for individuals in the
transport treatment, and by an insignificant 2 percentage points for individuals who were
invited to the job-application workshop. The types of occupations that workers are engaged
in are also similar across treatment and control individuals. In figures 1 and 2 we give a
breakdown of the ten most common occupations in the three experimental groups.
Earnings and work satisfaction are similar across experimental groups. This is in line
with the findings of a number of recent experimental studies of labour market interventions in developing countries (Groh et al., 2012; Jensen, 2012; Franklin, 2015). Further, the
coefficients we estimate are consistent with the magnitude of the effects on the quality of
jobs outlined above. We cannot reject the hypothesis that the treatment impacts on these
two variables do not differ from the naive prediction obtained from multiplying the treatment impacts on permanent and formal work by their marginal effects on earnings and
work-satisfaction. For example, among the controls, permanent work is associated with a
25 percentage points increase in work satisfaction, and formal work with a 22 percentage
point increase. Individuals invited to the workshop are 6.7 percentage points more likely
to have permanent work, and 5.2 percentage points more likely to have formal work. Multiplying the two effects and adding up, we predict that work satisfaction should increase
by 2.7 percentage points in the job search support group. The estimated treatment effect on
work satisfaction for this experimental group is 2.1 percentage points, quantitatively close
22

This is not surprising, as attrition in this study is modest and is not significantly correlated with treatment.

18

and statistically indistinguishable from the naive prediction.
In addition to testing the effects of the interventions on the primary employment outcomes, we evaluate their impacts on a range of secondary outcomes, including (i) other
outcomes about job quality, (ii) financial outcomes, (iii) expectations, reservation wages
and aspirations, (iv) spatial mobility, (v) education and training, (vi) psychological outcomes and (vii) social and job networks (the details are available in tables 17 to 24 in
the online appendix). Overall we find little evidence that our interventions have changed
outcomes in any of these areas. We have some limited evidence that the jobseekers who
were invited to the job application workshop are more optimistic about their labour market
prospects. They expect to receive 20 percent more job offers in the next four months than
individuals in the control group. They also expect five weeks less of unemployment before
finding the next job. Only the first effect is significant, and does not survive the multiple
comparison correction.

6.1

Which groups benefit from the interventions?

We investigate treatment effects for a number of groups defined in the pre-analysis plan.
We are interested in heterogeneity along two key dimensions. First, do the interventions
help groups that typically have worse labour market outcomes — for example, women
or the less educated? Second, do the interventions help those who face the strongest job
search constraints? To identify constrained jobseekers, we first look at individuals who
spent less than the median number of weeks searching for a job in the three months prior
to the randomisation. We then investigate proxies for financial, spatial and informational
constraints. In particular, we use baseline measures of savings, distance from the city
centre, previous work experience, and the use of skills certificates or a CV. When such
characteristics are continuous, we create groups by separating individuals below and above

19

the median level of the characteristic. For each outcome, we run the following specification:

where xi,pre is a categorical variable with values {0, . . . , m}, and I xi,pre = v is a indicator
variable that takes the value of 1 when xi,pre is equal to v. The coefficients γv f estimate the
effect of treatment f for group v.

< Figure 3 here. >

< Figure 4 here. >

< Figure 5 here. >

< Figure 6 here. >

We find that the effects on job quality (permanent and formal work) are concentrated
among the least educated jobseekers and, to some extent, among women. To study heterogeneity by education, we separate individuals who have a high school degree and no
further education, individuals who have a high school degree and further vocational training, and individuals who have a university degree or above. Figures 3 and 4 show that the
effects of both interventions are mostly driven by the group that has only a high school
degree. For this group, the job application workshop raises the probability of permanent
employment by 10 percentage points, and the transport intervention raises it by 5 percentage points. On the other hand, treatment effects for individuals with higher educational
attainment are close to zero. In the control group, about 5 percent of individuals with
at most secondary education have a permanent job. The workshop, therefore, triples the
probability of permanent employment for this group, and the transport subsidy doubles
20

it. We find qualitatively similar results for the formality of employment. Impacts are concentrated among individuals with a high school degree, who experience an increase in the
probability of formal employment of about one third.
Both the transport intervention and the workshop significantly improve the the quality
of jobs for women. We report these results in figure 5, and table 5 in the appendix. The
transport intervention significantly increases both women’s probability of permanent work
and probability of formal work by 35 percent, while women invited to the workshop are
about 45 percent more likely to work in a permanent job, and 35 percent more likely to
be in formal employment. Effects for men are less robust. The transport intervention does
not increase the probability of permanent employment for men. We can reject the null
hypothesis that the effect of the transport intervention on permanent work is equal for
men and women at the 5 percent level. Further, the job application workshop has a small
and insignificant impact on men’s probability of being in formal employment, and effect
that is statistically different from the effect we measure for women.
Second, the improvement in job quality is concentrated among individuals who do not
search actively at baseline, individuals with no previous work experience, and individuals
with low savings (tables 13, 14 and 15 in the online appendix). For example, individuals
who do not search actively at baseline experience a significant increase in the likelihood of
permanent employment of about 9 percentage points when invited to the job application
workshop. For active jobseekers on the other hand, we estimate an insignificant increase of
4 percentage points.
When we investigate how treatment effects vary with distance from the centre, we obtain a nuanced picture. The permanent employment effects are driven by individuals who
live within 6km of the city centre. Treatment effects are smaller in magnitude and insignificant for individuals who live in the periphery. However, individuals living in the periphery
experience a significant and marked decline in the probability of self employment thanks
to the transport intervention. This effect is not observed for individuals living closer to the
centre and for individuals invited to the job application workshop. In the final section of
the paper we discuss this finding in greater deal.

21

6.2

Mechanisms

How do treated individuals obtain jobs of higher quality? We study three possible mechanisms. First, individuals who are offered the interventions can search more intensely,
for example they can dedicate more time to job search and they can make more applications. Second, treated individuals can change their search strategy. This can either involve
searching for different jobs or using different search methods. Finally, treated jobseekers can
become more effective at job search. We measure search effectiveness by computing the
ratio of job interviews to applications and the ratio of job offers to applications in the 12
months prior to the endline interview.
In this section, we make extensive use of the high frequency data from the phone
interviews. Pooling data from the phone calls across all weeks enables us to estimate
the weekly impact of the interventions and the overall trajectory of treatment effects. We
estimate two regression models. First, to obtain weekly impact estimates, we run:

Eg

2

+∑

Es

∑

γsw · spilloversi · dwit + αt · yitc,pre + δ · xi0 + µitc .

(3)

s =1 w = Ss

where ηt is a time-specific intercept term. We allow the effect of the baseline control
term yic,pre to vary over time by estimating αt for each time period, while we estimate
time-invariant effects of individual covariates xi0 . w is a variable indicating the number of
weeks since each treated individual began receiving his/her treatment. w = 0 in the week
when the treatment started, and is negative for weeks before that. dwit is a dummy variable
equal to 1 in period t if an individual started receiving their treatment w periods ago. For
example, for an individual assigned to receive the transport treatment from week 15 of

22

the study onwards, the dummy d0it is equal to 1 in week 15 and to 0 in all other weeks.23
Individuals in the control group have all such dummy variables set to 0. Thus, β gw is our
estimate of the impact of intervention g, w weeks after the intervention started.
Second, we estimate the trajectory of treatment effects by pooling all post treatment
(w > 0) time observations together and estimating quadratic trends over time of the treatment effect for each intervention.24 To do this, we estimate equation 3, subject to quadratic
constraints on β gw and γsw , and to the assumption that no treatment has an effect before it
commences.

That is, instead of estimating parameters β gw and γsw , we will estimate φg0 , φg1 , φg2 , θs0 ,
θs1 and θs2 .
23

24

Similarly, for an individual who starts treatment in week 15, we set d−1i14 = 1, and d5i20 = 1, and so on.
Note that because interventions ran for different lengths of time, the number of weeks for which we will be
able to estimate the treatment effect relative to the start week of the treatment will differ by treatment. In
the notation above Sg denotes the earliest week for which we will be able to estimate a treatment effect for
treatment or spillover group g. Eg denotes the final week. If, for example, a treatment began in week 15 of
the study, then Sg = −15 and Eg = 39. For this treatment, we will use data from week 10 of the study to
estimate the coefficient β g−5 .
In the pre-analysis plan, we had originally intended to include w = 0 in the quadratic fit. On reflection, it is
preferable to allow the treatment effect to begin the week after treatment begins.

23

6.2.1

Effects on job search intensity

We find that the transport intervention increases the intensity of search. In the weeks when
treatment is available, treated individuals are about 25 percentage points more likely to
search for a vacancy at the job board – a form of job search that requires transport. This
represents a fivefold increase over individuals in the control group.25 In the same period,
treated individuals are about 12.5 percent more likely to be doing any job search activity
than control individuals (a 5 percentage point effect over a control mean of 0.4). This effect
decreases linearly after the transport intervention ends. In the model where we impose
quadratic constraints, we are able to estimate a significant effect on job search at least 2
months after the end of the intervention. The job application workshop, on the other hand,
does not affect the likelihood of searching for a job. Figures figures 7, 8 and 9 illustrate
these findings.
We find that study participants temporarily decrease the amount of work they take
during weeks when the transport subsidy is available (figure 10). The effect is driven by a
reduction of work in self-employment (figure 11). Franklin (2015) finds a similar effect of
transport subdisies for a sample of active jobseekers.
More frequent search activity does not translate in a higher number of job applications for individuals in the transport group. On average, individuals in the control group
place 1.3 applications for temporary jobs and 2.3 applications for permanent jobs in the 12
months before the endline interview. As shown in table 4, these numbers are not significantly different for either the transport or the workshop interventions.

< Figure 7 here. >

< Figure 8 here. >

< Figure 9 here. >
25

Throughout the course of phone survey, an average of 5 percent of control individuals search at the job
boards in any given week.

24

< Figure 10 here. >

6.2.2

Effects on search efficacy

Our treatments significantly increase the efficacy of job search for the high impact groups
described above. In the full sample, control respondents receive a job offer of permanent
employment every 6.1 applications. Respondents in the two treatment groups receive an
offer nearly every 4 applications. These effects, described in table 4 are however not statistically significant. Focusing on high-school graduates, one of the high-impact groups of
the intervention, reveals stronger and statistically significant effects. Control individuals
with a high school degree receive an offer for a permanent job every 10.6 applications. Both
interventions reduce that figure to 5.2 applications, a very large impact. In the discussion
section we present more analysis that allows us to understand what drives the increased
search efficacy among workers with only secondary education. The next section rules out
the possibility that this is due to a change in the types of jobs they search for after the
intervention.

6.2.3

Effects on the types of jobs sought by study participants

We do not find evidence suggesting that treated individuals search for different jobs compared to individuals in the control group. We test this hypothesis in three different ways.
First, we use self-reported data on reservation wages and find that treated individuals
report being willing to work for the same wages as control individuals.26 This holds on average, as well as within educational categories ( see table 20 and figure 20 in the appendix).
Second, in the endline survey we ask individuals whether they stopped searching for some
occupation in the previous 12 months. This question was aimed at capturing jobseekers’
discouragement. We find that individuals in the three experimental groups are equally
likely to give up searching for at least one occupation and to stop searching for white col26

This is consistent with the fact that average earnings are similar across experimental groups, as discussed
above. Quantile regression analysis further confirms that the interventions did not affect earnings at the
bottom of the distribution.

25

lar jobs. Finally, in figures 1 and 2 we compare the probability of working in a number
of different occupations across the three groups. Occupation profiles look similar for the
three groups, with a slight shift towards white collar jobs for individuals in the transport
and workshop groups. Overall, this evidence suggests that treated individuals look for
similar occupations and are willing to work for similar wages. The effects on job search
efficacy are thus unlikely to be driven by jobseekers’ decision to search for ‘easier-to-get’
permanent and formal jobs.

6.3

Indirect effects on untreated jobseekers

In this section, we study the outcomes of untreated jobseekers who live close to program
participants. The benefits of the interventions can extend to this group if the young jobseekers who are offered the programs share information, job referrals or resources with
friends and acquaintances in the same neighbourhood. Information and risk sharing of
this kind have been documented in several recent studies on developing countries’ labour
markets (Angelucci and De Giorgi, 2009; Magruder, 2010).27 On the other hand, untreated
youth living close to program recipients can experience negative effects if these groups
compete for scarce jobs in the same neighbourhood.
As explained in the design section, some eligible respondents living in clusters assigned
to treatment are not offered the program. This is a ‘partial population experiment’ (Moffitt
et al., 2001), which allows us to compare untreated individuals living close to program
participants to untreated individuals living in clusters where no jobseeker has been offered
the program. We report the results of this analysis in columns 4 and 5 of table 3.
We do not find statistically significant differences between untreated individuals living
in geographical clusters assigned to one of the two interventions and untreated individuals
in pure control clusters. However, we are less powered to detect indirect effects compared
to the direct effects we studied above. For example, we estimate that untreated individuals
in clusters assigned to the job application workshop experience an increase in the proba27

The descriptive evidence from our surveys further confirms that social networks are an important source of
information about work opportunities and are used extensively for job referrals.

26

bility of formal work of 5.6 percentage points. This effect is of the same magnitude as the
treatment effect we estimate on individuals who are offered the job application workshop,
but it is not statistically significant.
We also randomly vary the proportion of individuals treated in the clusters that received the transport intervention. This allows us to run a regression of the form:

yic =κ + β 20 · S20c · Ci + β 40 · S40c · Ci + β 75 · S75c · Ci + β 90 · S90c · Ci

+ γ20 · S20c · Ti + γ40 · S40c · Ti + γ75 · S75c · Ti + γ90 · S90c · Ti
+ α · yic,pre + δ · xi0 + µic .

(6)

where the sample is restricted to individuals in clusters assigned to pure control and
clusters assigned to the transport intervention. Ti identifies individuals who have been
assigned to the transport treatment, while Ci identifies individuals who have not been assigned to the transport treatment. S20c is a dummy variable for individuals living in a
cluster where 20% of individuals were offered the transport treatment. Thus, β 20 captures
the difference in outcomes between untreated individuals in these clusters and untreated
individuals in clusters where nobody was treated. Further, γ20 measures the difference
in outcomes between treated individuals in S20c clusters and untreated individuals in untreated clusters. S40c , S75c , S90c , and the remaining β and γ coefficients have a similar
interpretation.

The indirect effects of the transport treatment depend on the level of saturation. As the
transport intervention has direct impacts on permanent and formal work, we first study
indirect impacts on these two dimensions. In figures 12 and 13 we present estimates from
model 6. We document a positive indirect effect for control individuals in clusters with 25
(40) percent saturation for written agreement (permanent work). We also document that
untreated individuals in clusters with 90 percent saturation are 5.6 percentage points less

27

likely to be in permanent employment than individuals in pure control clusters.28

7

Discussion: What constraints did the interventions relax?

In this section, we present some additional analysis to explore the nature of the constraints
faced by the jobseekers in our study and the extent to which the interventions relaxed these
constraints.29

7.1

Spatial constraints

We have argued that high transport costs make job search difficult for the young unemployed. These costs are particularly high for individuals that live far away from the centre
of the city. If transport costs are indeed a barrier to job search, these individuals may be
more likely to work in sectors of ‘last resort’ compared to those residing closer to the centre
of the city. Some forms of self-employment are thought to be sectors of ‘last resort’ (Falco
and Haywood, 2016). Further, if our interventions relax this spatial constraint to job search,
we expect to observe a weaker spatial pattern in employment outcomes among treated
individuals. We investigate these hypotheses by computing the smoothed local polynomial estimate of the relationship between distance from the city centre and various for of
employment.
We find that in the control group the probability of being self-employed increases almost linearly with distance from the city centre. The probability of having any employment, on the other hand, does not change with distance. This suggests that spatial barriers
influence the occupational structure of the urban labour market and is consistent with
a model where high transport costs distort job search. This finding complements recent
work on the effect of transportat costs on the occupational structure in villages (Asher and
Novosad, 2015).
28
29

For the regression on permanent work we can reject the null hypothesis that all β coefficients are equal to
0.
The analysis in this section was not registered in the pre-analysis plan.

28

Most importantly, we find that the transport intervention eliminates the spatial patterns
of self-employment observed in the control group. Figure 17 shows that in the transport
group, individuals who reside far from the city centre have the same probability of being in
self-employment as individuals who live close to the centre of the city. Regression results
with differential effects of distance by group (either linear or quadratic) confirm that the
transport treatment significantly alters the effect of distance. These regressions confirm that
lowering the monetary cost of transport to the city centre removes the spatial influence on
the probability of self-employment: the effect of distance is statistically indistinguishable
from zero for the treatment group.

< Figure 17 here. >

Figure 18 in the appendix shows that the job application workshop similarly mitigates
the effects of space on the probability of self employment. Individuals in this experimental
group do not search more intensely, but become more effective in job search. This suggests
that effects of space can also be mitigated by improving search efficacy.

7.2

Information constraints

Did our interventions enable the labour market to separate more effectively high skilled
workers from low skilled workers? To address this question we exploit the detailed data
from the personnel selection tests. For each test, we regress individual test scores on
a rich set of covariates, including demographic characteristics, educational achievement,
and the work history of study participants. We choose this set of variables because they
can be readily signalled to an employer using a CV, a cover letter, or during the course
of an interview. Using the estimated coefficients, we obtain predicted test scores for all
individuals in our sample. Our objective is to study how predicted skills correlate with
labour market outcomes in different experimental groups.
Suppose that the job application workshop has no effect on participants’ ability to signal their skills to employers. In that case, we would expect the same correlation between
29

predicted test scores and employment outcomes in the treatment and control groups. In
contrast, suppose that the job application workshop allows individuals to signal their skills
more effectively. In this scenario, we expect to find a larger positive correlation between
predicted test scores and employment outcomes among individuals invited to the workshop, compared to the control group. That is, we expect the workshop to be particularly
useful for individuals with strong observable characteristics, who can benefit from being
more able to convey their attractive employment characteristics.
Our results suggest the the ability to signal skills has improved for low-education jobseekers — the group which experienced the strongest effects from the job application workshop. In this group, the correlation between predicted skills and having a permanent job
is significantly stronger among individuals invited to the workshop compared to the control condition. We also estimate that the correlation between predicted skills and earnings
increases, although insignificantly so. We report this analysis in table 27 and figure 15. We
are unable to find similar effects when comparing low education jobseekers in the transport
group to low education jobseekers in the control condition.30 So this effect is unique to the
job application workshop.
We also find that, among low-education individuals in the control group, high predicted
skills are not associated with better labour market outcomes (see table 27). The labour
market for workers with low levels of education does not seem to separate jobseekers on
basis of the skills which we measure through our tests. This separation occurs, however,
after we introduce the job application workshop program.
To measure predicted skills, we used characteristics that could be easily included in a
CV, cover letter, or discussed in an interview. The orientation component of the job application workshop is aimed at making workers more effective in this part of the application
process. Thus the results reported in this section suggest a positive effect of the orientation
component. Skills certification, on the other hand, should enable workers to signal skills
that are ‘hard to observe’, and not necessarily correlated with jobseekers’ observable characteristics. Does the additional information revealed in the certificates allow individuals to
30

This result is not reported, but is available upon request.

30

improve their employment outcomes? We turn to this question in the next section.

7.2.1

The role of certification

We look for evidence that the certification component of the workshop leads to better
employment outcomes for individuals who scored well on the tests. To this end, we employ
a regression discontinuity design. The certificates issued to respondents report test scores
in discrete bands. The original test score is not reported on the certificates and it not
disclosed to study participants. This allows us to study the impact of being placed in a
higher band, controlling for the original test score. The intuition behind this test is simple:
if the information that we disclose is driving at least part of the treatment effect, we would
expect a discrete improvement in outcomes when individuals are placed in a higher band.
We perform this analysis for the aggregate score and the Raven test score since we find
that these measures have the strongest predictive power for endline employment outcomes.
Scores below the median were lumped together into a bottom band, while individuals
scoring above the median were divided into five bands for each of the higher deciles of the
test score distribution. We implement local linear regression to control for raw test scores
on either side of the cut-offs, iteratively moving across all 5 relevant cut-offs. We use the
optimal bandwidth selection rule suggested by Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012), but all
results are consistent with different bandwidth selections.31
We find no evidence that scoring in a higher band, across any of the test scores, leads
to a significant improvement in employment outcomes, relatively to individuals scoring
in a lower band, once we control for the test score itself. Notably this is true for the two
main outcomes of job quality used in the paper so far: permanent work, and work with a
written agreement. Figure 16 illustrates this result, by showing the effect of being above
the median aggregate test score on having a permanent job. The full set of results, using
31

The optimal bandwidth selection is performed using the Stata command given by Nichols (2007). The
selected bandwidth differs across test outcomes and band cut-offs. For example the optimal bandwidth for
the aggregate test score at the 50th percentile is 0.62, where the median of the aggregate score is 4.843 with
standard deviation of 0.88. In cases where the selected bandwidth is larger than the reported test score band
itself, we check that the results are robust to restricting the bandwidth to the range within the marks band.

< Figure 16 here. >

We interpret these results as suggestive evidence that the information about ‘hardto-observe’ skills carried by the certificates is not crucial in driving the effect of the job
application workshop. Rather, the intervention helps workers improve the way they signal observable skills. Two further pieces of evidence corroborate these conclusions. First,
self-reported data on the use of the certificates indicates that about 58 percent of the respondents who received the certificate and made at least one job application did not show
the certificate to their prospective employer. Second, the residuals from a regression of
test scores on observable characteristics (a rough proxy for unobservable workers’ abilities)
do not correlate positively with employment outcomes. In sum, while the job application
workshop increased workers’ capacity to signal their easier-to-observe skills, helping employers separate workers on the basis of idiosyncratic and hard-to-observe skills is more
challenging.

Conclusions

Cities in the developing world are growing at an unprecedented pace. A key challenge
for policy makers is to identify effective interventions to support the large number of individuals who find it hard to access urban labour markets: the young, women and those
without tertiary education. In this paper, we conduct a randomised evaluation of two interventions to improve the labour market prospects of young Ethiopian jobseekers. The
first intervention is a transport subsidy that covers the cost of travelling to the centre of the
city to look for employment. The second intervention is a job application workshop with
two components: certification of skills and orientation on how to make effective job applications through CVs, cover letters, and interviews. We hypothesised that the programs
would enable jobseekers to search more intensely and more effectively, resulting in improved employment outcomes. A fortnightly panel of short phone interviews allows us to
32

study these mechanisms in detail. We also randomised the proportion of treated jobseekers
within geographical clusters to study the effects of non-participants residing in program
localities.
We find that both interventions help jobseekers to secure better jobs. Individuals who
are offered the job application workshop are 30 percent more likely to have a permanent job,
and nearly 25 percent more likely to have a formal job than individuals in the control group.
The transport subsidy leads to a 25 percent increase in formal employment. These effects
are statistically significant and robust to a correction for multiple comparisons. Impacts
are concentrated among the socio-demographic groups that have the worst employment
outcomes at baseline: women and those with at most secondary education.
On average, we do not find indirect effects on untreated individuals living in the proximity of treated ones. Exploring variation in the intensity of the transport treatment across
areas, we find some positive impacts on the job quality of untreated neighbours when the
proportion of treated jobseekers is low and some negative effects when that proportion is
very high (90%).
Detailed analysis based on a high-frequency phone survey reveals that the interventions operate through the hypothesised mechanisms. The transport intervention allows
jobseekers to search more intensely, while search efficacy improves for jobseekers in both
the transport and the workshop groups. We also find that both interventions relax spatial
constraints on occupational choices. The job application workshop also overcomes a crucial informational barrier by allowing low educated workers to better signal their skills to
employers and earn higher returns on them. These results suggest that interventions of
this kind can ease spatial constraints on job search and correct information asymmetries
that may damage workers’ prospects when ability cannot be easily signalled.
In conclusion, this paper shows that active labour market programs can improve the
employment outcomes of urban jobseekers in developing countries, and especially the
most disadvantaged: the young, women, and those without tertiary education. Exploring whether job-search support can be successfully bundled with interventions that in-

33

crease workers’ cognitive and non-cognitive skills (Card et al., 2011; Attanasio et al., 2011;
Blattman et al., 2015; Ghosal et al., 2015; Heller et al., 2015; Hirshleifer et al., 2015) and how
to best coordinate programs that assist job search and programs that foster entrepreneurship (Blattman et al., 2013; Fafchamps et al., 2014; Fafchamps and Quinn, 2015) are interesting avenues for future research.

Note. In this table we report the intent-to-treat estimates of the direct and indirect effects of the transport intervention and
the job application workshop on primary employment outcomes. These are obtained by least squares estimation of equation
(1), weighting each observation by the inverse of the probability of being sampled. Below each coefficient estimate, we report
a p-value in parenthesis and a q-value in brackets. We correct standard errors to allow for arbitrary correlation at the level
of geographical clusters. q-values are obtained using the sharpened procedure of Benjamini et al. (2006). In the last three
columns we report the mean outcome for the control group, the p-value from a F-test of the null hypothesis that transport
subsidies and the job application workshop have the same effect, and the number of observations. *** p< 0.01, ** p <0.05, *

Note. In this table we report, separately for each education category, the intent-to-treat estimates of the direct of the transport
intervention and the job application workshop on primary employment outcomes. These are obtained by least squares
estimation of equation (2). Below each coefficient estimate, we report a p-value in parenthesis and a q-value in brackets. We
correct standard errors to allow for arbitrary correlation at the level of geographical clusters. q-values are obtained using the
sharpened procedure of Benjamini et al. (2006). In columns 3 and 6 we report the p-value from F-tests of the null hypotheses
that transport subsidies and the job application workshop, respectively, have the same effect for individuals with different
levels of education. In the last three columns we report the mean outcome in the control group for the different education
categories.*** p< 0.01, ** p <0.05, * p<0.1.

Note. In this table we report heterogeneous treatment effects for individuals that were searching above and below the
median number of weeks in the three months after being surveyed and before the start of the interventions. For each group,
we report the intent-to-treat estimates of the direct effects of the transport intervention and the job application workshop on
job search outcomes. These are obtained by least squares estimation of equation (2). Below each coefficient estimate, we

Note. In this table we report heterogenous treatment effects for individuals with and without experience in permanent
employment. For each group, we report the intent-to-treat estimates of the direct effects of the transport intervention and the
job application workshop on job search outcomes. These are obtained by least squares estimation of equation (2). Below each
coefficient estimate, we report a p-value in parenthesis and a q-value in brackets. We correct standard errors to allow for
arbitrary correlation at the level of geographical clusters. q-values are obtained using the sharpened procedure of Benjamini
et al. (2006). In columns 3 and 6 we report the p-value from F-tests of the null hypotheses that transport subsidies and the

Note. In this table we report the intent-to-treat estimates of the direct and indirect effects of the transport intervention and
the job application workshop on education and training. These are obtained by least squares estimation of equation (1),
weighting each observation by the inverse of the probability of being sampled. Below each coefficient estimate, we report
a p-value in parenthesis and a q-value in brackets. We correct standard errors to allow for arbitrary correlation at the level
of geographical clusters. q-values are obtained using the sharpened procedure of Benjamini et al. (2006). In the last three
columns we report the mean outcome for the control group, the p-value from a F-test of the null hypothesis that transport
subsidies and the job application workshop have the same effect, and the number of observations. *** p< 0.01, ** p <0.05, *
p<0.1.
