Implicit Taxation in Lottery Finance

ABSTRACT

State lotteries as they are operated in the United State today involve
four distinct aspects: legalization of lottery games, monopolistic provision
by the state, marketing of lottery products, and extraction of a portion of

the surplus they derive fran sales for state revenue. In this paper we use
conventional tools of applied public finance to examine the implicit tax
levied by lottery agencies through this fourth function. We examine the
incidence of the implicit lottery tax, focusing on the daninant lottery games
used in the 1980s. We find that the implicit tax is regressive in virtually

all cases. We then consider whether the implicit tax rate on lotteries is too
high, ccmparing that rate to excise tax rates on alcohol and tobacco.

State lotteries have been the fastest—growing source of revenue to state
governments in the U.S. since 1970. They are also the most

type of
state-owned enterprise in the 22 states that currently operate lotteries. Net

to $30 per capita in 1985. Since this
rixxiey was transferred to state treasuries to support other activities of these
governments, it is appropriate to call this transfer an "inlicit tax" on the
operation of the lotteries. Previous studies have examined the incidence of
revenues fran these

lotteries amounted

this implicit tax and dnonstrated that it was regressive during the 1970s.1
Because the product line has changed dramatically during the last decade as
the agencies have sought to broaden the appeal of their games, it is useful to

take arxther look at the distributional patterns of lottery sales. In
addition,

the conceptual basis for conclusions reached in the earlier

literature needs clarification. In particular, how can the lotteries be
labelled "regressive" if

Ptcpanying the rapid growth in aggregate and per capita lottery sales
has been a transformation in the product mix offered by lotteries. In the
early years of modern lotteries, the mainstay of the product line was a draw

operated like a raffle with periodic, usually weekly, drawings. Next
came "instant" games, requiring players only to scratch off a plastic covering
to reveal — instantly —— whether the ticket is a winning one. In the mid—
game

1970s lotteries entered the computer age with a numbers game, based on the

In order to clarify these and other issues related to the normative

second aspect of lotteries is provision. In all lotteries

in the u.s. and in most lotteries elsewhere, the government has made itself

the exclusive legal provider. If there were no economies of scale in the

provision of lottery products, this monopolization itself would have no

Taxation. Once a decision has been made to legalize the lottery and
operate

it as a state—owned monopoly enterprise, there remains a number of

operational decisions concerning product line and pricing. The appropriate

definition of

"price" in this context is a bit ambiguous; one reasonable

definition is "the cost of buying a probability distribution of prizes that
has expected value of

one dollar."

A closely related measure that is sintpler

for our purposes, is the takeout rate, the fraction of the total bet
retained by the state. (The takeout rate is identically equal to (p.-l )/p,

amount can also be thought of roughly as the "monopoly profits" accruing to
the state by virtue of its self-granted monopoly over the provision of legal
lottery products.8

In the context Of this conventional framework, two implications are
evident. First, the legalization and provision of lottery products create
consumer surplus, even when the takeout rate exeeds the average cost of
administration. Fbr the individual shown in Figure 2, this is area abc. By

this reasoning lotteries are welfare—erthancing.9 The second implication of
the analysis, however, is that this welfare gain due to the lottery's
introduction would be greater if the takeout rate were lower. If the lottery
were to produce at the minimum breakeven takeout rate (T2), the consumer
surplus would be as large as the triangle aef, although that would leave the

state with no revenue and is therefore a highly unlikely alternative.
The intensity of the controversy that surrounds lotteries suggests,
however, that any evaluation based on danand curves and conventional applied
welfare concepts may be seriously incanpiete. Lottery critics question two

focusing on lottery products other than weekly gaines is

Clotfelter (1979), a study of Maryland games concluding that the implicit

expenditures rise proportiately faster than incane, suggesting a progressive

Table 8 gives information on participation and expenditures by game in
Maryland.

For each of these games, average expenditures are highest in the

lost inccxne class. Absolute spending falls nnotonical1y in the 4—digit

daily nurrters game, while it shows a norironotoni-c pattern in the other games.
In contrast to previous tables, the distributions for the to nuiibers games in
Maryland appear to indicate inferior goods, clearly implying regressivity for
the

implicit tax. In this regard, the findings are consistent with those

based on sales data in Clotfelter (1979).

Overall, the

regressive.

B. ODncentration
Incidence measures based on mean expenditures such as those discussed

above obscure an important element in lottery incidence: participation is
heavily concentrated

within

a small

sgroup of

the population. In order to

examine concentration of play among individuals, we used a survey of
California residents taken several months after the introduction of that

state's lottery. At the time of the survey the only games offered were

t

instant games. The survey asked for the number of tickets purchased in the

tickets being priced at $1 each. Thble 9

of concentration in lottery purchases implied by the California survey.

During the period only about half of the sample bought any lottery tickets at

population that

played the most during the sample period

accounted

80 percent

of purchases. Another survey of California lottery expenditures based on
purchases within the last week yields similar results, with

percent

of players accounting for 64

the most

active 10

percent of all play.14

The

implication of this extreme concentration of lottery play is that

measures

of incidence based upon mean values alone are likely to miss

important distributional aspects of lottery finance. As a way of bringing
evidence on dispersion into the more traditional portrayal of incidence, we

follow an approach similar to that of King (1983). We used data from the
Maryland survey to calculate mean purchases for quintiles within

each

incane

class. Figures refer to average weekly expenditures for those who played
within the last month. Since fewer than 60 percent of every income class
played the lottery in the sample mcnth,

are zero

in every case. Figure 3 shows the class

and fifth quintiles by
the

the

quintile means

means for the third, fourth

inccrne class. The decline in mean expenditures between

lowest and the middle incane class is mirrored by wide variations within

each class. While all of

the class means are below $8 per week, the fifth

quintile means exceed $11 in every class. Especially striking is the very
heavy

play

among the most

active players in

the lowest incane classes. Pr

the most active 20 percent in the under—$10,000 class, average weekly
spending on the lottery was an astounding $30. The dispersion in lottery
expenditures within incane

classes

sIxwn here makes it clear that

a

relatively

small proportion of households in each income class is contributing a
disportionate share of the revenue fran

14

the lottery.

One might well

expect such dispersion in tax burdens for other excise

taxes, particularly alcohol and tobacco. For the sake of comparison to

widely—used excise tax bases, Figure 4 shows the percentage of total

quintile for several goods arid services.
cperxlitures for gasoline and telephone services are least concentrated, with
expenditures

accounted for by

the top

the top quintile spending less than half of the total in nost income classes.
Expenditures for tobacco and liquor exhibit irore concentration, particularly
at lower incomes. Yet lottery expenditures using the Maryland survey results
generally show still more concentration.15
C. Incidence by Other Characteristics
Although

income is the natural focal point for the analysis of tax

incidence, it is useful to determine in the present case whether lottery
participation varies by other social or demographic characteristics. Most
rotably,

it is important to examine variations in race due to the frequently-

voiced charge that state lotteries cater to players from minority groups. It

is also

interesting to know how participation varies with education, since

Figure

This measure of heavy play also illuminates the degree of

of play. Plainly, heavy lottery play is much irore prevalent
airong blacks than whites in Maryland, and this difference is rrost striking in
concentration

the lowest incane class. In that class, the proportion of blacks who repDrt
betting over $10 per week approaches 45 percent, compared to less than 10
percent for whites. These racial differences are so large and pervasive in
this data set that we estimated separate equations for blacks and whites in
addition

to the basic equation in b1e 10.

Lottery expenditures for whites and blacks alike tend to fall with
education. This effect is significant only for whites, with the difference
between college graduates and those who did not complete high school being
alnost

$5 per week.

A similar pattern with

snaller

differences is observed

blacks, but due to the ta1 1 sample the coefficients are estimated very
imprecisely. Regarding age, the estimates imply that expenditures on lottery
products are lowest for the elderly and highest in the prime earning years of
for

25—54. Males spend mDre than fanales: the x)int estimates imply a difference

of about $1 for whites and $4 for blacks. Surprisingly, expenditures do not
vary significantly between urban and rural counties once incane, race arid the

other characteristics are held constant.

question. Public finance theory offers several well—known rules for
determining optimal public sector prices and excise taxes. In order to
suggest

the broad implications of this literature, we apply one of those

rules, fully aware that this application necessarily will be incomplete.

Feldstein (1972) incorporates distributional considerations in the
determination of optimal

public sector prices.

Cne

special case

he obtains is

a modification of the familiar Ramsey pricing rule for the special case in

ich cross-elasticities of dauand are zero. Any externalities in production
or consumption
marginal

are ignored. Where the p's are gross prices and the m's are

costs, E11 and E22 are the

own—price

elasticities

of denand

for goods

1 and 2, and D corresponds to the "distributional characteristic" of the t
goods, the ratio of optimal markups on the goods is given by:
—

=
(P2

—

')/P2

D12
(1)

E11

The distributional factor D12 given here is a function of the pattern of
consumption

of both goods over the incane distribution and the marginal social

utilities assigned to incane at different inccxnes. As the percentage of good 1

17

bought by the poor rises, D12 falls. If both goods are purchased at the same
relative magnitudes over the incane distribution, D12 = 1 and the rule reduces

to the simple inverse elasticity condition. As the relative concentration of
good l's purchases arrong lower incane purchasers rises, however, the optimal

markup for that good fal is, reflecting distributional considerations.

In order to assess current policy in light of this rule, we caripare the

implicit

tax rate for lottery products with the tax rates on alcohol and

tobacco products. Based

on an average distribution of 50 percent for prizes

15 percent for operating costs, lottery products face a typical markup of
percent apart frau federal taxes. We estimate that federal incane taxes on

and
35

prizes average roughly 5 percent

of sales, for a total tax rate of some 40

percent, shown in Table 11. This canpares with tax markups of about 30
percent on liquor, 13 percent on wine, 12 percent on beer, and 33 percent on

tobacco products, aggregating federal and state taxes on those products.

Regarding the "distributional characteristic," we have seen that lottery
purchases

exhibit either no relationship to incaute or are inferior

goods.

In

contrast, consi.iner expenditure surveys show that liquor is normal throughout

the

income distribution and that the other commodities are normal overall

(U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 1978, Table 1; congressional Budget of fice
1987, Table 1).

Fbr

current relative tax rates to satisfy the pricing rule, therefore,

either lottery products would have to be appreciably less price-elastic than

the

other products or lotteries would have to present more substantial

negative externalities. Neither possibility seens very strong.
with

the

strong suspicion, therefore, that the tax

lotteries are

too high

relative to those

18

levied on

rates

Crie

is

left

implicitly levied on

alcohol and tobacco.

V. Conclusion

once a state has decided to legalize and provide lottery gaines to its

an im!x)rtant public finance question remains: what is the
appropriate takeout rate? Without exception, the states and provinces in the
United States that have instituted lotteries have a hign takeout rate for
citizens,

the purpose of securing large net revenues. Although lottery revenues do
r,t approach the magnitnde of the major broad-based taxes on inccnie,

property and sales, they are large relative to excise taxes and are
certainly growing. In the United States the average rate of the inplicit
tax on gross lottery purchases, counting federal and state taxes, is about
40 percent, fnich exceeds the caTibined rate of tax on distilled spirits. It
seems difficult to justify such a high rate of tax on sumptuary grounds,
especially in light of the extensive marketing of lottery products conducted

by states.
presented here demonstrates that the incidence of the
implicit tax on lottery products in the l980s is highly regressive, as it was
The evidence

in the 1970s. Equally important are the particular patterns of variation
in tax rates within incane classes. Because lottery expenditures are
highly concentrated, the tax burden is also concentrated. The survey
present suggest that, within inccxne classes, blacks are more
results

likely to bet, and bet heavily, than ites. Looking at the provision aspect
of lotteries implies, of course, that these heavy players also benefit 'tore

aRough estimate of average marginal federal income tax rate. Approximate
percentage of winnings subject to tax (followed by assumed marginal tax rates
for winnings subject to tax in brackets) are: numbers (MD): 9% [.20]; lotto
(MD): 22% (middle prizes) [.20], 50% (jackpot) [.30]; lotto (MA, 12/21/85 —
1/22/86): 68% (jackpot) [.30]; instant (MD, 1986): 4% (middle prizes) [.20],
3.5% (high) [.30]; instant (VT, 1986): 9% [.25]. Resulting weighted average
marginal tax rates and proportion of sales for each type of game (taken from
Table 2) are: numbers: .02 and .41; lotto: .20 and .41; and instant: .02 and .17.
On average, 50 percent of sales are returned as prizes. Excluding passive
games from the calculation, the weighted average marginal income tax on sales
is: .5[.02(41)+.20( .4l)+.02( .l7)]/.99=.047.

2The ratio of jx)pulation in non—lottery states within 20 miles of a
state' s borders to the state' s own population was approximated using all or
half of county populations in bordering states.

3Data on sales to noriresidents is not normally available, but inferences
can be drawn fran the zip ccxles of winners. Fbr Massachusetts, such information

is available only for lotto. n analysis of 500 winners showed that 15 percent
lived outside of the state. New Hampshire, which had much siialler lotto

jackpots than Massachusetts, accounted for 7 percent, Ithode Island 4 percent,
New York, none, arid other states the remaining 4 percent. Maryland, with four
lottery states and one non—lottery state on its border, had a similar 16 percent
of lotto winners fran out of state. However, the percentage of other games on
by nonresidents was ualler: 13 percent in instant games and 9 percent in 4
digit nuiers games. These figures suggest that the BORDER variable is at best
an imperfect measure of the capacity for out—of—state sales.

4See DeBoer (1985) for a statistical test of econanies of scale in
lottery administration.
5Actual revenues fran lotteries airrost surely overstate their incremental
contribution to state budgets due to declines in other revenue sources. Pbr
example, to the extent that purchases of lottery tickets take the place of
taxable constxner expenditures, retail sales tax collection will decline.

%'triere various bases other than lottery expenditures are denoted B, average
tax rates on each of them t1, arid total state revenue. R =
+ tLL,

the incremental effect of an increase in lottery expenditures () is dR,/dL =
t1(dB1/dL). Fbr illustration, suppose a dollar's rth of lottery
tL +
tickets £reduces taxable retail sales by 80 cents arid there are no other
effects on any other tax base. In this case a state whose average lottery
contribution to net revenue is 35 cents per dollar of sales uld enjoy a
marginal contribution of only 29 cents per dollar if the state sales tax rate
re t percent and lottery winnings were not taxable. Fbr the case of
California, a state that does not tax lottery winnings, Vasche (1986, p. 48)
speculates that the lottery depresses revenues fran sales, incane arid pari-

mutuel taxes.

81f the opportunity costs of capital were added to administrative costs,
the conceptual correspondence to monoply profits is exact. This distinction
is ignored in the present discussion.

9The introduction of a new good (such as a legal lottery) will be
expected to cause a shift in the demand curves for substitute goods (in this
case,

illegal lotteries). This shift does not imply an offsetting reduction

in welfare, however, since the demand curve for legal lotteries already
accounts for the presence of the substitute good. This is so for the same
reason that the shift in the demand for a good creates no additional
offsetting welfare gain when a tax is placed on a substitute good. See
Harberger (1974, pp. 32 ff.), for example. For a similar application, see
Sugden and Williams (1978, pp. 134—137).

10 for example, Stokey & Zeckhauser (1978, pp. 263—264).

See, for example, Los Angeles Times Poll, March, 1986, referred to above.
12Clotfelter (1979) employs data on sales and average incomes by zip code.
'lb the extent that individuals purchase tickets outside their zip code

residence

of

and these zip codes have lower average income levels, the income
elasticities using such data will be biased downward. For that reason the
study makes conclusions based only on comparative incidence.

-3using midpoints of bounded income classes, implied lottery purchases
as a percent of income in California for the classes shown in Table 8 are

1.36, 0.79, 0.48, 0.34, 0.19, and 0.13. If the mean of the over $60,000
class is $80,000, the ratio for that class is 0.15.

141n order to calculate concentration or sample means in this March
survey, it was necessary to estimate the mean number for the highest category
on the questionnaire, which was 9 or more tickets. One method was to fit a
log—normal distribution, and the other was to use data on amount of winnings.
The estimate using the first method, 16 tickets, was lower and was the one we

use in this paper.
We

assumed that the natural log of weekly expenditures was normally

distributed over the population of those who purchased at least one ticket. A
normal distribution with mean of 1.0 and standard deviation of 1.25 provided a
good fit for the empirical distribution. The other method of calculating
average play in the top group relies on answers to a question concerning the
to a question concerning the amount n in the previous week. The average
reported winnings generally rises with number of tickets purchased, but the
average ratio of winnings to number of tickets ($1.04) is too high by a factor
of 2, given a 50 percent payout rate. Whether this results from a tendency to
overstate winnings or understate number of tickets purchased is unclear. But
assuming the ratio of reported winnings to play is constant for all players,
the average reported winnings for the top class, $20.75, implies an average
purchase of 20 tickets in the top category.

-5The figure is based on expenditures in Maryland, but similar results
re obtained for california using the Los Angeles Times Poll.

16The derivative of expected expenditures with respect to race is F(z)
multiplied by the coefficient 10.20.
