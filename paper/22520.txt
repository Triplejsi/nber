Cash Flow Duration and the Term Structure of Equity Returns
Michael Weber
NBER Working Paper No. 22520
August 2016
JEL No. E43,G12,G14
ABSTRACT
The term structure of equity returns is downward-sloping: stocks with high cash flow duration
earn 1.10% per month lower returns than short-duration stocks in the cross section. I create a
measure of cash flow duration at the firm level using balance sheet data to show this novel fact.
Factor models can explain only 50% of the return differential, and the difference in returns is
three times larger after periods of high investor sentiment. I use institutional ownership as a proxy
for short-sale constraints, and find the negative cross-sectional relationship between cash flow
duration and returns is only contained within short-sale constrained stocks.

Introduction

The term structure of equity returns is downward-sloping. van Binsbergen, Brandt, and
Koijen (2012) show that a synthetically created short-term asset that only pays dividends
in the near-term future has higher returns than the market index, which is a claim to the
stream of all future dividends. Their finding is puzzling because all leading asset-pricing
models, such as the external habit-formation model of Campbell and Cochrane (1999),
the long-run risk model of Bansal and Yaron (2004), or the rare disaster model of Barro
(2006) and Gabaix (2012), instead imply an upward-sloping or flat-term structure of equity
returns (see Lettau and Wachter (2007)). An active literature develops new equilibrium
asset-pricing models to rationalize the downward-sloping term structure (see, e.g., Belo,
Collin-Dufresne, and Goldstein (2015) and Ai, Croce, Diercks, and Li (2012)).1
van Binsbergen et al. (2012) use a sample from 1996 to 2009 that contains two major
recessions and stock market downturns. The term structure of interest rates often inverts
during adverse macroeconomics periods. Ait-Sahalia, Karaman, and Mancini (2015) show
the term structure of risk premia is downward-sloping during recessions but flat or upwardsloping during normal times. Alternative explanations for the downward-sloping term
structure of risk premia are differential taxation between dividends and capital gains (see
Schulz (2015)) and market microstructure noise (see Boguth, Carlson, Fisher, and Simutin
(2012)).
One avenue for disentangling these potentially conflicting explanations is to wait for
twenty years and perform an out-of-sample test. Instead, I tackle this problem by resorting
to the cross section of stock returns. Recent equilibrium models typically refer to the value
premium to motivate their analysis, and argue growth stocks have high cash flow duration
but low returns. Rather than relying on indirect inference via the value premium, I create a
direct measure of cash flow duration at the firm level using balance sheet data. I sort stocks
into ten portfolios with increasing cash flow duration. Low-duration stocks outperform
high-duration stocks by 1.10% per month, but have lower CAPM betas consistent with

See also Croce, Lettau, and Ludvigson (2015); Corhay, Kung, and Schmid (2015); Favilukis and
Lin (2016); Lopez, Lopez-Salido, and Vazquez-Grande (2015), and Marfè (2016), among others. van
Binsbergen and Koijen (2015) provide an excellent overview of this fast-growing literature.

results in van Binsbergen et al. (2012). Exposure to classical risk factors cannot explain
the novel cross section either.2 The difference in returns between low- and high-duration
stocks is three times larger after periods of high investor sentiment, and excess returns of
high-duration stocks load positively on changes in sentiment.
Market participants might be overly optimistic about the prospects of high-duration
stocks. Analysts expect stocks with high cash flow duration to grow twice as fast over the
following five years compared to low-duration stocks. This difference in growth forecasts
shrinks by more than 50% over the next five years. Analysts seem to extrapolate from past
earnings growth into the future. High-duration stocks indeed grew substantially faster in
the past than low-duration stocks, but they have the same growth in earnings over the
following five years. Standardized earnings surprises corroborate overly excessive growth
expectations for high-duration stocks.
Impediments to short selling might explain why rational arbitrageurs do not take
sufficiently large short positions in possibly overpriced high-duration stocks. I follow
Nagel (2005) and use institutional ownership, the fraction of shares institutions hold, as
a proxy for short-sale constraints to test this hypothesis empirically.3 I find evidence
consistent with mispricing. The spread in excess returns is strongest among stocks that
are potentially most short-sale constrained: low-duration stocks outperform high-duration
stocks on average by 1.32% per month in the lowest institutional ownership class. The
difference in returns monotonically decreases in institutional ownership to a statistically
insignificant 0.15% per month for potentially unconstrained stocks. Short-sale constraints
only matter for high-duration stocks, which are potentially overpriced; they do not matter
for short-duration stocks. The results hold for both small and large stocks, but also among
value and growth stocks.
My findings complement and extend evidence in van Binsbergen et al. (2012) and
van Binsbergen, Hueskes, Koijen, and Vrugt (2013), who use dividend futures and strips
2

A conditional consumption CAPM as in Lettau and Ludvigson (2001), a consumption CAPM with
ultimate consumption risk as in Parker and Julliard (2005) and Malloy, Moskowitz, and Vissing-Jørgensen
(2009), or downside risk as in Lettau, Maggiori, and Weber (2014) also cannot explain the duration-sorted
cross section.

Choi, Jin, and Yan (2013) provide empirical evidence consistent with the premise that institutional
ownership measures short-sales constraints.

with maturities of up to 10 and a sample period of 12 years. Similar to their work, I find
high average returns and volatilities at the short end of the term structure, lower CAPM
betas for short duration assets, and the value factor explains only part of the return
difference between low and high duration stocks. I complement their work because my
cross-sectional data allow me to study longer duration assets and a longer sample period.
The average duration at the stock level is 19 years in my sample from 1963 to 2014 and
ranges between 6 and 24 years at the portfolio level.
Exposure to untested risk factors might explain the cross section of stocks sorted on
cash flow duration. Ultimately, variation in the quantity or price of risk is observationally
equivalent to variation in sentiment and institutional ownership is an equilibrium outcome.
My findings, however, raise the bar for novel models to be consistent with the facts I
present in this paper and the puzzling findings in van Binsbergen et al. (2012) and van
Binsbergen et al. (2013): why is the risk premium so high for assets with low duration,
even at the very short end of the term structure?

Data

Stock return data come from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) monthly
stock file. I follow standard conventions and restrict my analysis to common stocks of
firms incorporated in the United States trading on NYSE, Amex, or Nasdaq. I exclude
financials (6000 ≤ SIC < 7000) and utilities (4900 ≤ SIC < 5000). To account for the
delisting bias in the CRSP database, I investigate the reason for the stocks’ disappearance.
If a company is delisted for cause (delisting codes 400-591) and has a missing delisting
return, I follow the findings in Shumway (1997) and assume a return of -30%. In some
cases, CRSP reports delisting returns several months after the security stopped trading.
In these instances, I pro-rate the delisting return over the intervening period as in Cohen,
Polk, and Vuolteenaho (2009). Market equity (ME) is the total market capitalization at
the firm level.
Balance sheet data are from the Standard and Poor’s Compustat database. I define
book equity (BE) as total stockholders’ equity plus deferred taxes and investment tax

4

credit (if available) minus the book value of preferred stock. Based on availability, I use
the redemption value, liquidation value, or par value (in that order) for the book value of
preferred stock. I prefer the shareholders’ equity number as reported by Compustat. If
these data are not available, I calculate shareholders’ equity as the sum of common and
preferred equity. If neither of the two are available, I define shareholders’ equity as the
difference between total assets and total liabilities. I supplement the book-equity data
with hand-collected book-equity data from Moody’s manual used in Davis, Fama, and
French (2000). The book-to-market (BM) ratio of year t is then the book equity for the
fiscal year ending in calendar year t-1 over the market equity as of December t-1.
I define the payout ratio (PR) as net payout over net income. Net payout is the sum
of ordinary dividends and net purchases of common and preferred stock. Return on equity
(ROE) is the ratio of income before extraordinary items over lagged book equity. Sales
growth (Sales g) is the percentage growth rate in net sales. As for the book-to-market
ratio, I calculate these numbers for the fiscal year ending in calendar t-1. Age is the
number of years a firm has been in Compustat. To alleviate a potential survivorship bias
due to backfilling, I require that a firm has at least two years of Compustat data.
I obtain data on institutional ownership from the Thomson Reuters 13F (TR-13F)
database. These data include quarterly observations on long positions of mutual funds,
hedge funds, insurance companies, banks, trusts, pension funds, and other entities with
holdings of more than $100 million of 13F assets. I calculate the institutional ownership
ratio (IOR) by first summing the holdings of all reporting institutions at the security
level and then dividing by the total shares outstanding from CRSP. If a common stock
is on CRSP but not in the TR-13F database, I assign an institutional ownership ratio of
0. I use the CRSP cumulative adjustment factor to account for stock splits and other
distributions between the effective ownership date and the reporting date. The TR-13F
database carries forward institutional reports up to eight quarters. In calculating the
institutional ownership ratio, I only keep the holding data as they first appear in the
database.
Data on analyst forecasts for earnings per share, long-term growth in earnings,
and realized five-year growth in earnings come from the Institutional Brokers Estimates

5

System (I/B/E/S).
The five Fama & French factors, the momentum factor, and the one-month Treasurybill rate come from the Fama & French data library on Ken French’s webpage.

A.

Cash-Flow Duration

Dur is the implied cash-flow-duration measure of Dechow, Sloan, and Soliman (2004).
Dechow et al. (2004) develop this measure and show that stocks with high cash flow
duration have low returns. They do not study exposure to risk factors, time variation in
the slope, or the effect of short-sale constraints, but instead posit that investors in the
stock market have a long holding period horizon.
Dur resembles the traditional Macaulay duration for bonds and hence reflects the
weighted average time to maturity of cash flows. The ratio of discounted cash flows to
price determines the weights:
PT
Duri,t =

s=1

s × CFi,t+s /(1 + r)s
,
Pi,t

(1)

where Duri,t is the duration of firm i at the end of fiscal year t, CFi,t+s denotes the cash
flow at time t + s, Pi,t is the current price, and r is the expected return on equity. The
expected return on equity is constant across both stocks and time. Allowing for firmspecific discount rates ceteris paribus amplifies cross-sectional differences in the duration
measure because high-duration firms tend to have lower returns on equity (see Panel
B of Table 1 and Table 2). Firm-specific discount rates, however, would not change
the ordering, and hence had no effect on my later results. The relative ranking is also
insensitive to changes in the level of r.4
Contrary to bonds, stocks do not have a well-defined finite maturity, t + T , and cash
flows are not known in advance.
Therefore, I split the duration formula into a finite detailed forecasting period and
an infinite terminal value and assume the latter is paid out as level perpetuity to deal
4

Variation over time in return on equity r does not affect the cross-sectional ordering which is the
main focus of the paper. We can interpret a constant r for a given sorting year t as the average return
on equity over the forecasting horizon. I discuss robustness checks in Section III.

To tackle the second complication, I assume clean surplus accounting, start from an
accounting identity, and forecast cash flows via forecasting return on equity (ROE),
Ei,t+s /BVi,t+s−1 , and growth in book equity, (BVi,t+s − BVi,t+s−1 )/BVi,t+s−1 :
CFi,t+s = Ei,t+s − (BVi,t+s − BVi,t+s−1 )

I model returns on equity and growth in equity as autoregressive processes based on
recent findings in the financial-statement analysis literature (see Dechow et al. (2004)).
I estimate autoregressive parameters using the pooled CRPS–Compustat universe and
assume ROE mean reverts to the average cost of equity (Nissim and Penman (2001)).
Nissim and Penman (2001) also show that past sales growth is a better predictor of future
growth in book equity than past growth in book equity. I assume that growth in book
equity mean reverts to the average growth rate of the economy with a coefficient of mean
reversion equal to average historical mean reversion in sales growth.
The book-to-market ratio and cash flow duration are often used interchangeably. A
linear relationship between the book-to-market and duration exists under the assumptions
that ROE immediately mean reverts and that no growth occurs in the book value of
equity. I will later show my measure of cash flow duration contains information over and
above the book-to-market ratio.
ROE has an AR(1) coefficient of 0.41 and BV of 0.24. I assume a discount rate r
of 0.12, a steady-state average cost of equity of 0.12, an average long-run nominal growth
5

As long as the finite forecasting horizon is sufficiently long to account for extraordinary growth
opportunities at the firm and industry levels, the assumption that cash flows are paid out as level annuity
has no impact on my results. A potentially terminal growth rate would be constant and therefore had
no impact on my cross-sectional ordering.

rate of 0.06, and a detailed forecasting period of 15 years.6 All my findings are robust to
reasonable permutations of these values (see discussion in Section III).
My sample period is July 1963 until June 2014. The sample is restricted from July
1981 until June 2014 when I make use of the institutional ownership and June 1982 to
June 2009 when I employ I/B/E/S data. To minimize the impact of outliers, I winsorize
all variables at the 1% and 99% level.

B.

Descriptive Statistics

Table 1 reports summary statistics in Panel A and cross-sectional correlations for various
firm characteristics and return predictors in Panel B. I calculate all statistics annually
and then average over time.
The average payoff horizon implied by stock prices is about nineteen years. An
average standard deviation of five years hints at substantial cross-sectional heterogeneity
in this variable. Institutions hold about 40% of all shares during my sample period, and
the average firm size is $2.1 billion.
Panel B shows that duration is strongly negatively correlated with book-to-market.7
In addition, high cash flow duration is associated with low payout rates, return-on-equity,
and firm age, but high growth in sales. No linear association exists between duration and
institutional ownership or size. The institutional-ownership ratio is strongly positively
correlated with size.
Low-duration stocks tend to be industrial and manufacturing companies, whereas
high-duration stocks were mainly in the software and internet sector in the 1990s and the
bio-sciences sector in the 2000s. Table A.1 in the online appendix reports five low- and
high-duration firms in 1996 and 2004.
6

Variation in expected inflation could affect the expectations about the long run nominal growth rate
of the economy, but should also affect the nominal discount rate. As stocks are claims on real assets,
changes in inflation expectations should not affect the value of the firm. Table 5 reports results for five
subsamples of ten years each. Return differences between high- and low-duration stocks are similar across
different subsamples.
7
Table 15 shows that my findings continue to hold within both value and growth stocks, indicating
that duration has information over and above book-to-market.

Duration and the Term Structure of Equity
Returns

A.

Portfolios Sorted on Duration

At the end of June each year t from 1963 to 2013, I sort stocks into 10 deciles based
on duration for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t-1. I rebalance portfolios on an
annual basis and weight returns within portfolio equally. Figure 1 plots the time-series
average annual portfolio return as a function of the average median portfolio duration.
This figure exhibits a negative relationship between duration and holding-period return:
low-duration stocks in portfolio 1 have, on average, a one-year holding-period return of
25%. The high-duration stocks in the last basket, on the contrary, earn less than 10% per
annum.
I regress excess returns at the portfolio level on various risk factors to test whether
traditional risk factors can explain the downward-sloping term structure of equity returns,
Ri,t = αi +

X

βi,s Xi,s,t + i,t ,

(5)

s

where Ri,t is excess return of portfolio i at time t, αi is a model-specific pricing error, and
βi,s is the time-series loading of returns on risk factor s, Xi,s , such as size.
Panel A of Table 2 presents monthly mean excess returns, OLS regression coefficients,
and pricing errors for the CAPM with standard errors in parentheses for equally-weighted
portfolio returns. We see in the first line of the table excess returns monotonically decrease
in cash-flow duration. In contrast to the negative relationship for returns, duration is
strongly positively related to CAPM betas. High-duration stocks have a CAPM beta of
1.41 compared to low-duration stocks, which have an exposure to the market of only 1.05.
Decreasing returns and increasing exposure to the market result in a monotonic negative
relationship between duration and pricing errors. A strategy going long low-duration
stocks and shorting high-duration stocks (D1–D10 in the following) leads to a statistically
significant excess return of 1.29% per month.
Panel B contains results for value-weighted returns. Size and magnitude of return
9

premia are economically and statistically similar to the equally-weighted returns. The
similarity between equally- and value-weighted returns is expected as size and duration
are almost uncorrelated (see Table 1).
Panel C shows that delisting returns are not driving my results. If I do not account
for delisting returns, the long-short portfolio returns is 1.03% per month compared to the
baseline of 1.10% per month.
The CAPM has little explanatory power in the modern sample period (see, e.g.,
Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004)).8 Table 3 reports alphas for the Fama & French
three-factor model, the three-factor model augmented with a momentum factor, and the
Fama & French five-factor model (Fama and French (2015)). The Fama & French threefactor alpha of the D1–D10 strategy is 1.15% per month, the four-factor alpha is 0.66%
per month, and the five-factor alpha is still a highly statistically significant 0.48% per
month. I report factor loadings in the online appendix to conserve space (see Table A.2
to Table A.4). Stocks with high cash flow duration tend to have similar loadings on the
market, size (SM B), and momentum as low-duration stocks, but they have lower loadings
on value (HM L), profitability (RM W ), and investment (CM A).

B.

Sensitivity and Subsample Analysis

The duration measure I present in Section II depends on assumptions regarding the
persistence in ROE and sales growth, the long-run growth rate in sales and ROE, the
discount rate, and the detailed forecasting horizon. Figure 2 reports excess returns of a
long-short portfolio for 11 different values of each parameter. Specifically, the discount
rate ranges between 0.07 and 0.17 (baseline 0.12), the detailed forecast horizon between
10 and 20 years (baseline 15), the sales growth persistence between 0.09 and 0.36 (baseline
0.2411), the ROE persistence between 0.15 and 0.65 (baseline 0.4067), the steady-state
growth rate in sales between 0.01 and 0.11 (baseline 0.06), and the steady-state growth
rate in ROE between 0.07 and 0.17 (baseline 0.12).
The red line in each panel shows the excess return for the baseline parameter values.
8

One exception is the cross section of stocks sorted on price stickiness (see Weber (2015) and
Gorodnichenko and Weber (2016)). Price stickiness and cash flow duration are uncorrelated in my
sample.

10

We see in the top panels of Figure 2 assumptions regarding the discount rate or the
detailed forecasting horizon barely affect the slope of the term structure of equity returns.
In the middle panels, we see moving from a sales growth persistence of 0.09 to a
persistence of 0.36 increases the cross-sectional returns premium from 1.01% to 1.24% per
month, whereas increasing the persistence in ROE lowers the return premium from 1.30%
to 0.62%.
In the bottom panels, we see the cross-sectional return premium is most sensitive
to extreme assumptions regarding the long-run sales growth and ROE. Increasing the
long-run nominal growth rate of the economy from a baseline of 6% to 11% cuts the
duration premium in half. Decreasing the long-run ROE from 12% to 7% instead lowers
the excess return by a similar amount.
Table 4 reports excess returns at the portfolio level for economically reasonable
variations of parameter values. Overall, over a wide range of parameter values, we find an
economically large and statistically significant downward-sloping term structure of equity
returns. The duration premium seems a pervasive feature of the data which alleviates
concerns of estimation uncertainty driving the results.

C.

Time Variation

The predictive power of many return characteristics varies over time. Recent examples are
the disappearance of the size premium or the momentum crash (see Daniel and Moskowitz
(2016)).
Table 5 reports average monthly excess returns at the portfolio level decade by decade.
Across decades, we see an average monthly duration premium of more than 1% per month.
The only exception is the very first decade from 1963 to 1973, during which the difference
in returns between low- and high-duration stocks is merely 0.69% per month, which is
still economically large and statistically significant.
The term structure of interest rates often inverts during adverse macroeconomics
periods. Ait-Sahalia, Karaman, and Mancini (2015) show that the term structure of risk
premia is downward-sloping during recessions, but flat or upward-sloping during normal
times. Figure 3 is a time series plot of annual excess returns for the low minus high
11

duration portfolio (blue line) and the market excess return (red dash-dotted line). Both
excess returns show substantial variation over time. During stock market downturns in
the earlier part of the sample up to 2001, we also see in the cross section of equity returns
a more pronounced downward-sloping pattern resulting in a large duration premium.
During the recent financial crisis, instead, low-duration stock fell more than high-duration
stocks, and we observe an upward-sloping term structure of equity returns and a negative
duration premium. The two time series have a negative correlation of -29.17%, which
increases in absolute value to -36.33% when the sample ends in June 2007.
There is substantial variation over time in the duration premium. Over longer
periods, such as decades, there is a robustly positive downward-sloping term structure
of equity returns. The downward slope was steepest during times of low market returns
in the earlier part of the sample, but we observe an upward-sloping term structure during
the onset of the recent financial crisis. The market return fell sharply, as did the duration
premium.

D.

Variation with Investor Sentiment

The results so far show that exposure to traditional risk factors does not suffice to
explain the lower returns of high-duration stocks compared to low-duration stocks. I
now investigate a potential mispricing explanation for this finding. I present Fama &
French three-factor adjusted monthly excess returns following periods of high and low
investor sentiment. Stambaugh et al. (2012) argue that anomalies should be stronger
following periods of high investor sentiment if mispricing is at the root of the anomaly.9
In periods of high investor sentiment, the views of investors about the prospects of many
stocks could be overly optimistic, leading to temporal overpricing. This effect should be
strongest for stocks that are hard to value. A positive return to the D1–D10 strategy
should be larger after periods of overpricing and be mainly attributable to the short leg.10
The mean level of the sentiment index of Baker and Wurgler (2006) determines
9

Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2015) show that investor sentiment and arbitrage asymmetry can also
explain the idiosyncratic volatility puzzle (see Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2006)).
10
High-duration firms tend to be younger firms with negative payout ratios and returns on equity, but
historically strong growth in sales, and are therefore potentially difficult to value (see Table 1).

12

periods of high and low investor sentiment. Following Stambaugh et al. (2012), I define a
high-sentiment month as one in which the sentiment index was above the mean value in
the previous month.
Table 6 presents Fama & French-adjusted excess returns following periods of high and
low investor sentiment in Panel A. The benchmark-adjusted excess returns conditional on
high and low sentiment are the estimates of αH and αL in the following equation:
Ri,t = αi,H dH,t + αi,L dL,t + βM arket M arkett + βSM B SM Bt + βHM L HM Lt + i,t ,

(6)

where dH,t and dL,t are dummies indicating high- and low-investor-sentiment months.
A strong negative relationship exists between duration and Fama & French-adjusted
excess returns in high-sentiment months: the D1–D10 strategy earns a highly statistically
significant abnormal return of 1.32% per month. Looking at the numbers for the individual
portfolios, we see almost 90% of this abnormal return is due to the large negative riskadjusted return for the high-duration portfolio. The profitability of the D1–D10 strategy
is reduced by a factor of 3 to 0.46% in low-sentiment months.
Comparing the results within portfolios across high- and low-sentiment months
indicates high-duration stocks could be prone to overpricing in periods of high investor
sentiment. High-duration stocks earn negative risk-adjusted returns after periods of
high sentiment. No abnormal returns occurs in either direction following periods of low
sentiment for high-duration stocks.
Panel B of Table 6 measures the relationship of changes in the sentiment index
and abnormal portfolio returns. I run separate time-series regressions for each of the 10
portfolios of Fama & French-adjusted returns on changes in the sentiment index. I find
that low- and intermediate-duration portfolios show no significant relationship, whereas
high-duration portfolios load strongly on changes in the sentiment index. This evidence
lends further support to temporary overpricing of high-duration stocks.

Analyst Expectations

Table 7 reports historical cash-flow fundamentals and analyst forecasts.11 Panel A presents
the evolution of the average portfolio long-term earnings growth (LTG) forecast from June
of year t until June of year t+4. LTG is a forecast of the growth rate in earnings per
share before extraordinary items over the next three to five years. LTG for year t increases
monotonically in duration from 13% for low-duration stocks to about 26% for portfolio
D10. This forecast remains fairly stable for low-duration stocks as we look at years t+1
until t+4. On the contrary, for high duration-stocks, LTG falls by 7% over the next four
years.12
The drop in expected long-term growth of high-duration stocks could be due to
overly optimistic initial forecasts or mean reversion in earnings. To discriminate between
these two explanations, I report realized five-year growth in earnings between years t-6
to t-1 and t to t+5 in Panel B. For the pre-portfolio-formation period, we see again a
strong positive association between realized five-year growth in earnings and duration.
Low-duration stocks grow on average by 7%, whereas high-duration stocks grow by 31%.
This difference in growth rates disappears over the following five years; both high- and
low-duration stocks grow at an annual rate of roughly 10% per annum. This finding
hints at an extrapolation bias in analyst forecasts for the long-term growth prospects of
high-duration firms and further indicates that market participants are overly optimistic
in their perceptions of the prospects of high-duration stocks.
Panel C corroborates this finding looking at three different measures of standardized
earnings surprises following Livnat and Mendenhall (2006).13 SU E1 uses a rolling seasonal
random walk model for expected earnings, SU E2 excludes special items, and SU E3 uses
IBES-reported analyst forecasts and actuals. Stocks with low cash flow duration have
a positive median earnings surprise across all three measures. High-duration stocks, on
the other hand, have negative or 0 median earnings surprises. Research in accounting

Analysts mainly cover large companies, and therefore the following results might not be representative
for the universe of CRPS/Compustat stocks considered so far. In untabulated results, I also find a
downward-sloping term structure of equity returns for the subset of IBES firms.
12
I report results for all firms with non-missing LTG forecasts for all periods. Results are unchanged
if I look at all firms with non-missing forecasts at any point in time.

Short-Sale Constraints and the Term Structure
of Equity Returns

The previous section illustrates that overpricing could be at the core of a downward-sloping
term structure of equity returns. For overpricing to persist temporarily, however, rational
arbitrageurs have to be restrained from taking sufficiently large short positions to correct
the mispricing (see Miller (1977)).
In this section, I investigate whether the low returns of high-duration stocks
are concentrated among short-sale-constrained stocks as proxied by low institutional
ownership. I first verbally describe the testable implications. I then motivate institutional
ownership as a proxy for short-sale constraints, and analyze the interplay of duration and
short-sale constraints. I close this section by briefly discussing the robustness of my
results.

A.

Hypotheses

Hypothesis 1 The positive abnormal return of going long low-duration stocks and short
high-duration stocks (D1–D5 in the following) should be contained in
portfolios with low institutional ownership.
Hypothesis 1 is a direct implication of the Miller (1977) theory. Divergence of opinion
about the future prospects of difficult-to-value, high-duration stocks paired with shortsale constraints leads first to overpricing and then to low returns once the mispricing is
corrected. If the downward-sloping term structure of equity returns is due to mispricing,
the negative relationship between duration and returns should become weaker with less
binding short-sale constraints.
Hypothesis 2 High-duration portfolios should drive the differences in returns of the D1–
D5 strategy across categories of institutional ownership.
15

Hypothesis 2 follows from the fact that short-sale constraints allow for overpricing, but
not for underpricing. If a specific stock is underpriced, sophisticated investors can take
sufficiently large long positions independent of short-sale constraints. Furthermore, shortduration stocks pay off most of their cash flows in the near-term future, have high returns
on equity and low growth in sales, and are therefore unlikely candidates for overpricing.

B.

Institutional Ownership and Short-Sale Constraints

Institutional and cultural considerations potentially restrict short-sale activities of
institutional investors. Almazan, Brown, Carlson, and Chapman (2004) report that
charters restrict about 70% of mutual funds to pursue any short-selling activities, and
only 2% actually do sell short. Restricted institutions also do not synthetically engineer
short positions. Koski and Pontiff (1999) report that only 21% of equity mutual funds
make use of any derivative instruments. Therefore, the only possibility for institutions to
express negative opinions about the outlook of specific stocks is to reduce existing long
positions. Once institutions have sold their positions completely, they have to sit on the
sidelines and their negative opinions are no longer reflected in market prices. A direct
implication of these arguments is arbitrage capital increases in institutional ownership.
Contrary to the centralized market for shorting NYSE stocks in the early 20th century,
nowadays short sellers have to search for a stock lender in opaque shorting markets. A
lower level of stock loan supply therefore implies tighter short-sale constraints due to
higher search cost (see Duffie, Gârleanu, and Pedersen (2002)). D’Avolio (2002) shows
institutional ownership is the most important cross-sectional determinant of stock loan
supply. He also reports that custody banks that engage in stock lending on behalf of their
institutional clients are the most reliable stock lenders, whereas discount brokers are the
least dependable.
Short sellers could also have a preference for borrowing stocks from institutional
owners. Dechow, Hutton, Meulbroek, and Sloan (2001) highlight that short squeezes, the
recall of stock loans by lenders, are less likely for stocks with high institutional ownership.
In addition, transaction and borrowing costs also decrease in institutional ownership.
These arguments indicate that short-sale constraints are tighter and the cost of
16

shorting is higher for stocks with low institutional ownership.
Institutional ownership is of course an endogenous variable. Institutional ownership
has increased substantially over my sample period which, ceteris paribus, should have
increased the stock loan supply and lowered short-selling costs. ETFs and index funds
drove a large part of the increase in institutional ownership in recent years. My crosssectional prediction should continue to hold, however, as cash-flow duration and index
inclusion are almost orthogonal. These passive institutions also just replicate an index
and are therefore not actively trading against potential mispricings of stocks.
Stock-lending fees are an alternative measure for short-sale constraints (see Drechsler
and Drechsler (2014)). Equity lending data are, however, not available before 2004, as
opposed to data on institutional ownership, which start in 1980.

C.

Descriptive Statistics

Table 1 illustrates that institutional ownership and size are strongly positively correlated.
Many return anomalies are stronger within smaller stocks, potentially because of lower
liquidity and higher transaction costs (Griffin and Lemmon (2002) and Israel and
Moskowitz (2013)). I follow Nagel (2005) to purify my proxy for short-sale constraints
from confounding size effects, and sort on residual institutional ownership.14 In each
sorting year, I run a cross-sectional regression of logit-transformed institutional ownership
on a constant, the natural logarithm of size, log(M E), as well as log size squared and use
the residual, RIORit , of this regression as my sorting variable:
log

IORit
= α + β1 log(M E) + β2 (log(M E))2 + RIORit .
1 − IORit

(7)

I replace institutional ownership ratios below 0.0001 and above 0.9999 with these threshold
values. In addition, I also delete the 20% smallest stocks from my sample.15
14

Wang (2014) and Stambaugh et al. (2015), among many other papers, also use residual institutional
ownership as a proxy for short-sale constraints.
15
Jones and Lamont (2002) point out that controlling for confounding size effect can be crucial to
disentangle the cost of short selling from size effects. Excluding the quintile of the smallest stocks also
ensures my findings are not driven by stock-picking skills of institutions. Lewellen (2011) shows that
institutions in the aggregate have little stock-picking skills, and institutional ownership has no predictive
power for returns. For micro caps, however, he finds a quarterly abnormal return of 0.57%.

17

Table 8 provides time-series averages of annual cross-sectional means of firm
characteristics for the 25 portfolios sorted on duration and residual institutional
ownership. At the end of June each year t from 1981 to 2013, I sort all common stocks
listed on NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ above the 20% size percentile into quintiles based
on duration for all firms with fiscal years ending in calendar year t-1. I intersect these
quintiles with an independent sort on residual institutional ownership as of December
t-1. Using a six-month time lag for institutional ownership ensures that short-term
outperformance of institutional trades do not drive my results (see Chen et al. (2000)).
Panel A shows low-duration stocks in portfolio D1 have on average a duration of
about 11 years, whereas high-duration firms have an average duration of roughly 25
years. Duration within duration sorts, on the other hand, is constant across residual
institutional ownership classes.

Panel B captures the negative correlation between

duration and book-to-market, and suggests that institutions tend to hold stocks with
higher book-to-market ratios.

Panel C verifies that institutional ownership is quite

homogeneous within the residual institutional ownership category, but varies substantially
with residual institutional ownership. According to Panels D and E, high-duration stocks
have lower or even negative payout ratios and returns-on-equity, whereas no strong
relationship with residual institutional ownership exists. Across portfolios of residual
institutional ownership, high-duration stocks have higher sales growth and tend to be
younger than low-duration stocks (Panels F and G). Sales growth and the number of years
a firm has been on Compustat is fairly stable within portfolios of the same duration. As
for size in Panel G, I find an inverse U-shaped relationship with residual institutional
ownership similar to Nagel (2005). However, compared to the variation of size in the
CRSP universe, the variation of size across sorts on residual ownership is negligible.
The sorting on residual ownership is therefore successful in engineering variation in my
short-sale-constraints proxy, independent of size.
Overall, the double sorting generates portfolios that are fairly similar across residual
institutional ownership portfolios, whereas they exhibit large variation across duration
categories. High-duration stocks tend to have characteristics that Baker and Wurgler
(2006) and Griffin and Lemmon (2002) associate with speculative, hard-to-value stocks

18

that are prone to divergence of opinion. Daniel et al. (1998) draw on the insights from the
psychology literature (see, e.g., Einhorn (1980)) and argue mispricing should be stronger
for stocks requiring more judgement in valuing them and for which feedback on this
evaluation is ambiguous in the short run. They mention as an example stocks for which
the bulk of cash flows is expected to be paid out far ahead in the future. In the next
subsection, I test whether short-sale constraints keep smart money out of the market so
that market prices temporarily reflect only the opinions of the most optimistic investors,
leading first to overpricing and then to negative abnormal returns once this overpricing
is corrected.

D.

Effect of Short-Sale Constraints on the Term Structure of
Equity Returns

Table 9 reports monthly mean excess returns for the 25 portfolios.

We see a

pronounced downward-sloping term structure of equity returns for stocks with low
residual institutional ownership, which are potentially the most short sale constrained.
Low-duration stocks earn an excess return of 1.02% per month. The return decreases
monotonically in duration. High-duration stocks earn an excess return of -0.30% per
month. The spread in excess returns for the two extreme-duration portfolios is 1.32% per
month and highly statistically significant.16
Focusing on the long-short portfolio in the last column, we see excess returns decrease
monotonically in residual institutional ownership. For stocks that are potentially the
least short-sale constrained, the long-short portfolio has a statistically insignificant excess
return of 0.15% per month, confirming Hypothesis 1. The difference in returns across
residual institutional ownership portfolios of more than 1% per month comes entirely
from variation in returns for high-duration stocks. Excess returns increase from -0.30%
to 0.94% from low to high residual institutional ownership, as predicted by Hypothesis 2.
Low-duration stocks, on the other hand, exhibit no variation with the proxy of short-sale
constraints. Institutional ownership only matters for stocks that are potentially prone
16

The results in Table 9 do not directly map into the results of Table 2 as stocks have to be above the
20% size percentile and the sample starts in 1981 rather than 1963.

19

to differences in opinion. A strategy going long the low-residual institutional ownership
portfolio and short the high-residual institutional ownership portfolio (I1 - I5) earns an
insignificant excess return of -0.08% for stocks with low cash flow duration. This spread
decreases monotonically to a highly significant -1.24% per month for high-duration stocks.
This finding is in line with the prediction of the Miller (1977) theory. Differences in
opinion paired with short-sale constraints lead to temporal overpricing. High-duration,
short-sale constrained stocks earn low returns once the overpricing is corrected. The data
do not back the alternative hypothesis that institutional ownership reflects smart money.
Returns increase in residual institutional ownership only for stocks within the highest
duration categories.17
Stocks with similar duration but different degrees of residual institutional ownership
have similar fundamentals (see Table 8). Therefore, it is unlikely that specific investment
styles or superior analysis and information of institutions drive the heterogeneous effect
of institutional ownership across duration categories. Nevertheless, I correct for the
portfolios’ exposure to risk in the following to rule out covariances with risk factors explain
the pattern in excess returns presented in Table 9.18
Correcting for market exposure does not materially change any of the previous
findings for excess returns. Table 10 shows that the D1–D5 strategy earns a risk-adjusted
excess return of 1.61% per month for stocks with low institutional ownership. This
differential decreases to a statistically insignificant 0.40% for stocks that are potentially
the least short sale constrained.
The CAPM has little explanatory power after 1963. Adjusting for exposure to
the three Fama & French risk factors has no significant impact on pricing errors. We
see in Table 11 that the abnormal excess returns of the long-short portfolio decrease
monotonically in institutional ownership, resulting in a spread across institutional
ownership categories of 1.22% per month. This spread is even slightly larger than the
17

Another alternative is that short-sale constraints are also more binding for high-duration stocks.
Diether, Lee, and Werner (2009), however, show that short-selling activity is higher for growth stocks.
18
Lewellen (2011) shows that even though institutions as a whole have no stock-picking skills for
large stocks, different types of institutions have modest ability compared to the CAPM. Controlling for
book-to-market and momentum, however, subsumes this effect.

20

spread in raw or CAPM-adjusted excess returns.19 Adjusting as well for momentum
reduces pricing errors for high-duration stocks, while having minor impacts for other
categories. The D1–D5 abnormal return is reduced to a highly significant 0.94% per
month within the class of low residual institutional ownership stocks. For the least
short-sale-constrained stocks, this differential abnormal return is -0.10% per month
and statistically indistinguishable from zero. Table 13 reports five-factor alphas. The
difference in alphas of the long-short portfolios between high- and low-duration stocks is
again more than 1% per month and highly statistically significant.
Tables A.6 to A.10 report the factor loadings for the 25 portfolios. CAPM betas
increase from about 1 for low-duration stocks to about 1.45 for high-duration stocks. This
pattern is independent of institutional ownership. For the Fama & French three-factor
model, high-duration stocks have higher exposure to market risk and load stronger on size
(SM B), but show less common variation with vale (HM L). Again, factor loadings are
remarkably similar across categories of residual institutional ownership. High-duration
stocks also tend to load more negatively on momentum. The difference in exposure
to market risk and size (SM B) for high- versus low-duration stocks vanishes for the
five-factor model. High-duration stocks tend to load more negatively on value (HM L),
profitability (RM W ), and investment (CW A).
My results are consistent with a mispricing explanation for the negative crosssectional relationship between cash flow duration and stock returns in the cross section:
the interplay between short-sale constraints and differences in opinion is what seems
responsible for a large part of the empirical regularity that high-duration stocks earn
lower returns compared to low-duration stocks. Exposure to untested risk factors might,
however, explain the cross section of stocks sorted on cash flow duration. Independent of
my findings, the puzzle of van Binsbergen et al. (2012) and van Binsbergen et al. (2013)
remains: why do very short-term assets have such a high risk premium?
19

Nevertheless, differences in mean excess returns compared to differences in factor loadings largely
drive the effect.

21

E.

Robustness

I perform several robustness checks to corroborate my previous results and distinguish
them from findings in the literature. Table 14 contains Fama-French-adjusted pricing
errors conditional on size.

I first sort all stocks into two bins based on market

capitalization. Within each size bin, I then sort firms into tertiles based on duration,
which I then intersect with an independent sort on residual institutional ownership. Panel
I reports Fama-French alphas for small stocks, whereas Panel II contains alphas for large
stocks. For both small and large stocks, we see a pronounced downward-sloping term
structure of equity returns for the lowest residual institutional ownership portfolios. The
differential in abnormal returns between high- and low-duration stocks is 1.45% per month
for small stocks and 0.72% for large stocks. This differential abnormal return again
decreases in residual institutional ownership, leaving a highly significant spread of 1.52%
between high- and low-residual institutional ownership categories for small stocks and
0.52% for large stocks.
Table 15 reports results for a similar exercise with book-to-market as a conditioning
variable. The previous findings hold both for growth stocks in Panel I and value stocks
in Panel II. A negative relation between duration and returns only exists for the most
constrained portfolios.

V

Conclusion

I construct a measure of cash flow duration at the firm level using financial statement data.
Portfolios of stocks sorted into deciles based on the measure of cash flow duration exhibit
a spread in returns between low- and high-duration stocks of more than 1% per month.
Low-duration stocks have a monthly mean excess return of 1.45%, whereas high-duration
stocks earn 0.32% per month. Exposure to classical risk factors cannot explain this pattern
in returns. A portfolio long low-duration stocks and short high-duration stocks earns a
statistically significant five-factor alpha of 0.48% per month. The return of this arbitrage
portfolio varies substantially with investor sentiment. It is three times higher after periods
of high investor sentiment.
22

The variation in the return differential with investor sentiment indicates that
mispricing could explain the downward-sloping term structure of equity returns. I study
the earnings expectations of market participants and find that (a) analysts have overly
optimistic growth forecasts in fundamentals for high-duration stocks, which they adjust
downwards over time; (b) analysts extrapolate from past earnings growth into the future;
and (c) high-duration stocks have negative earnings surprises and seem to engage in
earnings management.
Mispricing can only persist in the presence of limits to arbitrage. I provide evidence
that the interplay between differences of opinion and short-sale constraints drives my
results.

Within short-sale-constrained stocks, I find a statistically and economically

large spread in excess returns between high- and low-duration stocks of more 1.32% per
month. On the contrary, no difference in returns occurs across duration categories for
unconstrained stocks, consistent with models of rare disaster (Barro (2006) and Gabaix
(2012)).
In line with my proposed explanation for the empirical facts, returns do not vary
with short-sale constraints for short-duration stocks. Any variation in returns is driven
by high-duration portfolios, which exhibit a spread in excess returns across categories of
short-sale constraints of more than 1% per month without differing in firm characteristics
or exposure to risk factors.
Although correcting for standard risk factors has no impact on any of these
conclusions, exposure to other risk factors might still explain the negative relation between
cash flow duration and returns. Variation in the quantity or price of risk is observationally
equivalent to variation in investor sentiment.
My findings complement and extend evidence in van Binsbergen et al. (2012) and
van Binsbergen, Hueskes, Koijen, and Vrugt (2013). These papers use clean measures of
duration, but the dividend strips and futures data they use limit their analysis to a short
sample and assets with duration of only up to 10 years. Using information in the cross
section of stock returns, I am able to study a large time series and assets with duration
of more than 25 years.

This figure plots the time series average annual portfolio return as a function of the average median
portfolio cash flow duration. I sort all common stocks listed on NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ at the
end of June each year t from 1963 to 2013 into deciles based on duration for all firms with fiscal
years ending in year t-1. I weight returns equally and include delisting returns. If a firm is delisted
for cause (delisting code between 400 and 591) and has missing delisting return, I assume a delisting
return of -30% following Shumway (1997). Financial statement data come from Compustat. For
missing Compustat book equity values, I use the Moody’s book equity information collected by Davis
et al. (2000).

This figure plots annual long-short excess returns based on 10 cash flow duration sorted portfolios (blue
line) and the market excess return (red dash-dotted line). I sort all common stocks listed on NYSE,
AMEX, and NASDAQ at the end of June each year t from 1963 to 2013 into deciles based on duration
for all firms with fiscal years ending in year t-1. I weight returns equally and include delisting returns.
If a firm is delisted for cause (delisting code between 400 and 591) and has missing delisting return,
I assume a delisting return of -30% following Shumway (1997). Financial statement data come from

Table 1: Summary Statistics and Correlations for Firm Characteristics and
Return Predictors
This table reports time series averages of annual cross-sectional means and
standard deviations for firm characteristics and return predictors in Panel
A and contemporaneous correlations of these variables in Panel B. Dur is
cash-flow duration; BM is the book-to-market ratio; IOR is the fraction of
shares institutions hold; PR is net payout over net income; ROE is return
on equity; Sales g is sales growth; ME is the market capitalization in millions;
and Age is the number of years a firm has been on Compustat. Institutional
ownership information is obtained from the Thomson Reuters 13F database.
Financial statement data come from Compustat. For missing Compustat book
equity values, I use the Moody’s book equity information collected by Davis et al.
(2000). The sample period is June 1981 to June 2014. I only use stocks above
the 20th size percentile.

Panel A reports monthly mean excess returns, time series factor loadings (β), and pricing errors (α) for the CAPM for ten
portfolios sorted on duration (Dur) with OLS standard errors in parentheses. I sort all common stocks listed on NYSE, AMEX,
and NASDAQ at the end of June each year t from 1963 to 2013 into deciles based on duration for all firms with fiscal years
ending in year t-1. I weight returns equally and include delisting returns. If a firm is delisted for cause (delisting code between
400 and 591) and has a missing delisting return, I assume a delisting return of -30% following Shumway (1997). Market is the
value weighted return on all NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ common stocks minus the one-month Treasury bill rate. Financial
statement data come from Compustat. For missing Compustat book equity values, I use the Moody’s book equity information
collected by Davis et al. (2000). Panel B reports results for value-weighted portfolio returns and Panel C for equally-weighted
portfolio returns without including delisting returns.

This table reports pricing errors (α) for the Fama & French three-factor model (αF &F 3 ), the three-factor model augmented
with momentum (αF &F 4 ), and the Fama & French five-factor model (αF &F 5 ) for ten portfolios sorted on duration (Dur)
with OLS standard errors in parentheses. I sort all common stocks listed on NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ at the end of
June each year t from 1963 to 2013 into deciles based on duration for all firms with fiscal years ending in year t-1. I weight
returns equally and include delisting returns. If a firm is delisted for cause (delisting code between 400 and 591) and has a
missing delisting return, I assume a delisting return of -30% following Shumway (1997). Market is the value-weighted return
on all NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ common stocks minus the one-month Treasury bill rate, SM B is the average return on
three small portfolios minus the average return on three big portfolios, HM L is the average return on two value portfolios
minus the average return on two growth portfolios, M om is the average return on two high prior return portfolios minus the
average return on two low prior return portfolios, RM W is the average return on two robust operating profitability portfolios
minus the average return on two weak operating profitability portfolios, and CM A is the average return on two conservative
investment portfolios minus the average return on two aggressive investment portfolios. Financial statement data come from
Compustat. For missing Compustat book equity values, I use the Moody’s book equity information collected by Davis et al.
(2000).

well as sentiment betas in Panel B for ten portfolios sorted on duration (Dur) with OLS standard errors in parentheses. I sort all
common stocks listed on NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ at the end of June each year t from 1963 to 2013 into deciles based on
duration for all firms with fiscal years ending in year t-1. I weight returns equally and include delisting returns. If a firm is delisted
for cause (delisting code between 400 and 591) and has a missing delisting return, I assume a delisting return of -30% following
Shumway (1997). I define high and low sentiment periods by the mean level of the sentiment index of Baker and Wurgler (2006).
Sentiment betas are the time series factor loadings of the benchmark-adjusted mean excess returns on a constant and changes in the
sentiment index. Financial statement data come from Compustat. For missing Compustat book equity values, I use the Moody’s
book equity information collected by Davis et al. (2000). I use the Fama & French three-factor model is as benchmark. The sample
period is July 1965 to December 2010 due to the availability of the sentiment index.

This table reports time series averages of annual cross sectional means for firm characteristics and return
predictors used in the subsequent analysis for twenty-five portfolios sorted on duration (Dur) and residual
institutional ownership (RIOR). I sort all common stocks listed on NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ at
the end of June each year t from 1981 to 2013 into quintiles based on duration for all firms with fiscal
years ending in year t-1. I intersected these quintiles with an independent sort on residual institutional
ownership as of December t-1. Dur is cash flow duration; BM is the book-to-market ratio; IOR is the
fraction of shares institutions hold; RIOR is the residual in a cross sectional regression of IOR on size;
PR is net payout over net income; ROE is return on equity; Sales g is sales growth; ME is the market
capitalization in millions; and Age is number of years a firm has been on Compustat. I obtain institutional
ownership information from the Thomson Reuters 13F database. Financial statement data come from
Compustat. For missing Compustat book equity values, I use the Moody’s book equity information collected
by Davis et al. (2000). I only use stocks above the 20th size percentile.

This table reports pricing errors (α) for the Fama & French three-factor model for nine portfolios sorted on duration (Dur)
and residual institutional ownership (RIOR) with OLS standard errors in parentheses, separately for small stocks in Panel I
and large stocks in Panel II. I sort all common stocks listed on NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ at the end of June each year t
from 1981 to 2013 into two baskets based on size, and within each bin I sort stocks into tertiles based on duration for all firms
with fiscal years ending in year t-1. I intersect these tertiles with an independent sort on residual institutional ownership as of
December t-1. I weight returns equally and include delisting returns. If a firm is delisted for cause (delisting code between 400
and 591) and has a missing delisting return, I assume a delisting return of -30% following Shumway (1997). Market is the
value-weighted return on all NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ common stocks minus the one-month Treasury bill rate, SM B is
the average return on three small portfolios minus the average return on three big portfolios, and HM L is the average return
on two value portfolios minus the average return on two growth portfolios. Dur is cash flow duration. RIOR is the residual
in a cross sectional regression of the fraction of shares held by institutions on size. Institutional ownership information is
obtained from the Thomson Reuters 13F database. Financial statement data come from Compustat. For missing Compustat
book equity values, I use the Moody’s book equity information collected by Davis et al. (2000). I only use stocks above the
20th size percentile.

Table A.8: Four Factor loadings of 25 Portfolios sorted on Duration and
Residual Institutional Ownership

βSM B

βM arket

This table reports time series factor loadings (β) for the Fama & French three-factor model
augmented with momentum for twenty-five portfolios sorted on duration (Dur) and residual
institutional ownership (RIOR) with OLS standard errors in parentheses. I sort all common
stocks listed on NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ at the end of June each year t from 1981 to 2013
into quintiles based on duration for all firms with fiscal years ending in year t-1. I intersect
these quintiles with an independent sort on residual institutional ownership as of December t-1.
I weight returns equally and include delisting returns. If a firm is delisted for cause (delisting
code between 400 and 591) and has a missing delisting return, I assume a delisting return of
-30% following Shumway (1997). Market is the value-weighted return on all NYSE, AMEX, and
NASDAQ common stocks minus the one-month Treasury bill rate, SM B is the average return
on three small portfolios minus the average return on three big portfolios, HM L is the average
return on two value portfolios minus the average return on two growth portfolios, and M om is
the average return on two high prior return portfolios minus the average return on two low prior
return portfolios. Dur is cash flow duration. Financial statement data come from Compustat.
For missing Compustat book equity values, I use the Moody’s book equity information collected
by Davis et al. (2000). I only use stocks above the 20th size percentile.
