Trophy Hunting vs. Manufacturing Energy: The Price-Responsiveness of Shale Gas

JEL No. D24,L71,Q41
ABSTRACT
We analyze the relative price elasticity of unconventional versus conventional natural gas
extraction. We separately analyze three key stages of gas production: drilling wells, completing
wells, and producing natural gas from the completed wells. We find that the important margin is
drilling investment, and neither production from existing wells nor completion times respond
strongly to prices. We estimate a long-run drilling elasticity of 0.7 for both conventional and
unconventional sources. Nonetheless, because unconventional wells produce on average 2.7 times
more gas per well than conventional ones, the long-run price responsiveness of supply is almost 3
times larger for unconventional compared to conventional gas.

Over the past decade, technological developments have driven increased natural
gas and oil extraction by opening access to resources stored in shale and other
“tight” formations. These unconventional technologies and resources have allowed
drillers to extract from significantly larger subsurface acreage using fewer wellbores
and with much higher production per well. The combination of hydraulic fracturing
and horizontal drilling techniques has underpinned this unconventional supply and
the resulting shale gas boom.1 Supported initially by high natural gas prices during
much of the 2000s, the United States has experienced significant increases in natural
gas and oil production.
The shale revolution has fundamentally changed how gas and oil are produced
in the United States. In the words of one industry expert,2 conventional oil and
gas investments resemble high-risk/high-reward, “big game trophy hunting,” which
involves drilling many dry holes in search of a few highly productive ones. This
stands in stark contrast to modern unconventional extraction from shale, which is
commonly said to resemble a “manufacturing process” in that operators have much
more flexible and certain control over their production levels.
Multiple features of unconventional gas lead to this flexibility. First, industry
operators have better information about the location and scale of shale resources
than they do for conventional formations; the obstacle is extracting them. As one
industry analyst stated, “[w]e knew the shale formations were there but we didn’t

Conventional wells tap porous and permeable resources that flow to the wellhead naturally once
the well is drilled. Unconventional wells require hydraulic fracturing, where tight shale resources
are artificially stimulated with high-pressure water causing fissures that are propped open to allow
the gas and oil to flow to the wellhead. The process requires more time and at a higher cost to
complete the well.

have the technology to extract from them.”3 Second, shale resources produce a
much larger amount of resources quickly, suggesting a tighter relationship between
drilling effort and realized production. Altogether, experts have suggested that these
factors make unconventional gas and oil more responsive to prices.4
To the extent that unconventional gas is more price responsive, the shale boom
has likely “flattened out” the U.S. natural gas supply curve, thereby reducing price
volatility. Indeed, following the boom in shale gas, prices have been significantly
less volatile compared to the early 2000s. To the extent that unconventional gas
is responsible for this diminished volatility, continuation would help reduce uncertainty for policymakers and businesses considering investments that are highly
sensitive to gas prices. For example, compliance with regulations reducing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants may involve higher reliance on natural
gas-fired generation, both as a substitute for coal and as backup for intermittent renewable power. The economic benefits of investments in LNG export infrastructure
also depend on stable natural gas prices, as do the benefits of domestic investments
in energy-intensive manufacturing and chemical production.
Given the differences in geology and changes to drilling technology, this research seeks to disentangle the differences in operators’ price-responsive behavior
between conventional and unconventional gas. We consider different aspects of the
production process to assess the differences between unconventional and conventional wells at each stage of the supply function, beginning with the decision to
drill the well, complete the well, and produce gas over time. We estimate these

relationships using econometric models that appropriately describe each stage of
well development and execute the analysis using detailed data from approximately
62,000 gas wells drilled in Texas between January 2000 and September 2015.
We find that the important margin for production responses to price changes
is drilling investment, whereas neither production from existing wells nor the time
from drilling to first production respond strongly to price changes. We estimate
a long-run drilling elasticity to prices of approximately 0.7 and find no clear evidence that this elasticity is different for unconventional compared to conventional
gas drilling. While unconventional wells take somewhat longer to reach production, they produce much more gas per well than conventional wells and have less
risk associated with variation in well productivity. This faster flow rate per well
turns out to be the primary margin by which aggregate supply from unconventional
gas production is more price responsive than conventional production.
We use these econometric results to conduct a simulation of the effect of an
exogenous 10 percent price shock on wells drilled and gas supplied over time, providing a time-varying price response. We find that unconventional gas production
responds more strongly to price changes (nearly 3-fold in the long-run) than conventional production does. These are the first econometric estimates to isolate the
differences in supply response between shale gas and conventional gas.

Literature

The paper spans several literatures related to the economics of the oil and natural gas
industry and more generally to non-renewable resource extraction. We contribute to
a nascent but growing area of research on the effects of greater accessibility to shale

3

gas (Joskow 2013). The study also contributes to understanding of price formation
in fossil fuel markets (e.g., Hamilton 2009; Kilian 2009). Specifically, we analyze
the separate phases of energy development and isolate the industry decisions that are
responsive to changes in natural gas and oil prices, effectively estimating a supply
elasticity in a much more disaggregated manner than is typical in past work.
The resource extraction literature seeks to characterize firms’ optimal extraction decisions and depletion rates (Nystad 1987; Adelman 1990; Davis and Cairns
1998; Cairns and Davis 2001; Thompson 2001; Smith 2012; Cairns 2014; Kellogg
2014). Our paper empirically tests the degree to which natural gas production decisions are sensitive to shocks in prices and whether there are differential effects for
conventional versus unconventional resources and technologies. Using more disaggregated, well-level data applied to gas (rather than oil), we find similar evidence
to Anderson, Kellogg and Salant (2014) that the quantity produced from alreadyproducing wells is not elastic or price sensitive.
The demand and supply elasticity literature often compares short and long-run
results, typically finding that gas and oil supply elasticities are inconsequential once
wells have been drilled and that supply is less responsive in the short run than in the
long-run. Papers analyzing oil extraction elasticities include Griffin (1985); Hogan
(1989); Jones (1990); Dahl and Yücel (1991); Ramcharran (2002); and Güntner
(2014). There is very little published econometric evidence on natural gas supply
elasticities (Erickson and Spann 1971; Dahl 1992; Krichene 2002), much of which
is dated and none of which focuses on the impact of the recent shale gas revolution.
Our paper is specifically focused on estimating the heterogeneous responses for
unconventional compared to conventional drilling decisions, centered on the recent

4

shale gas boom occurring in states such as Texas, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, and
Arkansas. Hausman and Kellogg (2015) estimates aggregated supply and demand
elasticities to capture welfare impacts of the shale boom across industrial sectors
and producers, and heterogeneous effects across space.
Our study also contributes to understanding decline curves for unconventional
wells, which has important implications for the inertia and cyclicality inherent in
gas and oil markets. Decline curves from conventional wells are commonly modeled using the “Arps equation,” which nests exponential, hyperbolic, and harmonic
decline curves. By contrast, Patzek, Male and Marder (2013) argue that unconventional gas wells in the Barnett shale formation follow a fundamentally different
functional form: proportional to 1 over the square root of time for the first few
years, and then exponential after that. This same functional form is also used in
Browning et al. (2014), among other studies. While we explore functional form in
this paper, we ultimately focus on a non-parametric approach to decline paths.

Industry Background and Data
Industry Structure

Unconventional drilling describes the technological combination of more advanced
hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling techniques that are used to extract natural gas and oil from tight-shale formations. Unconventional gas and oil reserves
are stored in these tight-shale formations where the resources are difficult to extract
unless the shale is artificially stimulated using a technique like hydraulic fracturing.

5

Further, large quantities of shale resources are located beneath more densely
populated regions of the country, and these resources can now be accessed through
horizontal drilling techniques, with laterals extending from the vertical well for
thousands of feet in any horizontal direction. Combined with advancements in seismic and surveying technologies, these extraction methods increase the accessibility
to otherwise inaccessible natural gas and oil.
As a result, unconventional gas and oil production differs from conventional
methods in several ways across the stages of development, which are described
in the following subsections. In particular, the process can be broken down into
the following stages: leasing and permitting; spudding a well (i.e., commencing
drilling); well completion and stimulation; and production over time.

II.A.1

Leasing and Permitting

Before obtaining a permit to drill a well, a firm signs leases with the mineral rights
holders of acreage from which the firm wants to extract natural gas and/or oil,
and these mineral rights holders may be private landowners or government entities. Once the mineral rights are leased, firms apply for a permit to drill a well
from the relevant state regulatory agency. During the term of the lease, the lessor
(landowner) retains the ownership and use of the surface estate while the lessee
(firm) has the right to extract and sell the resources stored in the sub-surface mineral estate. In return for the right to extract, the lessor is paid a lump-sum bonus,
land rental payment, and royalty on the value of the extracted resources.
Currently, shale-based hydrocarbons are extracted from onshore reserves where,
in the United States, the mineral rights are typically privately held. In these cases, a

6

firm privately contacts and negotiates leases with landowners, which is in contrast
to first-price sealed bid auctions that allocate government-owned offshore rights.5
In the state of Texas, where we focus this empirical analysis, the Texas Railroad
Commission is the state regulator tasked with issuing and maintaining oil and natural gas permits along with monitoring well activity once drilling begins.
While we investigated estimating the permitting stage explicitly, this stage did
not add significantly to the analysis so we did not include it in our model. Permitting
tends to be quick and low-cost, in contrast to drilling and completion which require
significantly larger investments. For further research on the leasing decision see
Porter (1995); Libecap and Smith (2002); Fitzgerald (2010); and Vissing (2015).

II.A.2

Drilling

Once mineral acreage is leased and a well is permitted, drilling can commence, and
while drilling unconventional wells results in greater oil and natural gas production
per well, it is also more technically challenging and expensive than conventional
onshore extraction. An unconventional well is drilled both vertically and then horizontally as compared to a conventional well that is drilled in only the vertical direction. The vertical segments typically reach 4,000 to 13,000 feet in depth and the
horizontal segments typically extend 2,000 to 7,000 feet. The horizontal segment of
an unconventional well allows firms to extract more natural gas from a larger subsurface mineral acreage using a single wellbore. Drilling begins at the date a well
is “spudded.” The firm that owns the well typically does not drill it itself. Rather,
drilling is typically contracted out to specialized oilfield service companies (e.g.,

Offshore leases are typically awarded through competitive bidding in first-price sealed bid auctions (where the bid is the up-front “bonus payment”, and royalty rates are fixed).

Schlumberger and Halliburton) that charge daily rates to rent their drilling rigs and
services. These rig rates are on the order of $15,000 per day.6

II.A.3

Well Completion and Stimulation

Following the drilling phase, a well must be completed. Completion primarily involves casing, perforating, and possibly stimulating the well. A casing is a large
diameter pipe cemented into the wellbore, and it prevents the well from caving in
and protects groundwater from contamination. The horizontal part of the casing
in the shale formation is perforated using perforating guns containing explosive
charges so that gas and/or oil can flow into the casing and up to the surface.
Permeable conventional reservoirs have natural pressure that causes the resource
to flow easily to the surface without any additional work. However, the impermeability of tight-shale formations requires that the well be artificially stimulated,
generating fissures in the rock that allow the gas and oil to flow freely up to the wellhead. Shale wells are artificially stimulated through large-scale hydraulic fracturing
techniques. This process injects millions of gallons of water mixed with sand and
chemicals into the well at a high pressure. The pressure causes the rock to fracture,
generating fissures in the rock that are propped open by the sand in the fracturing
fluid. Once the fracturing fluid returns to the surface, the newly propped fissures
allow the gas and oil to flow more easily up to the wellhead.
6

However, this is a small piece of the total cost of developing a well. For example, according
to one industry expert, the overall cost of developing a well has been on the order of $4-12 million,
whereas payments to drillers may make up only $0.5 million of this (30 days at $15,000 per day).

8

II.A.4

Production over Time

Once a well is completed, it often produces oil and natural gas for many years,
even several decades in some cases. The largest quantity of production is realized
in early periods because of the higher reservoir pressure. Production from existing
wells involves little marginal cost, so firms’ incentives are to produce the resources
to recover their drilling and completion costs quickly. The flow rate of oil and
natural gas to the surface is therefore a direct function of the quantity of resources
remaining in the ground. As more hydrocarbons are extracted, there is less natural
pressure pushing what remains to the surface, reducing the flow rate.
As a result, the production rate of a typical well decreases quickly. In our data,
gas production typically decreases more than 60 percent from its peak after only
one year. In addition, in the first year of production, conventional and unconventional gas wells realize 35 percent and 34 percent, respectively, of their total gas
production. In the first five years, they realize 78 percent and 77 percent of total
production, respectively. Further, because the marginal cost of production from an
existing well is fairly low, many wells continue to be kept in production even after
their flow rates asymptote to zero. Firms also have alternative extraction methods
to increase the flow rate in later periods, including reservoir stimulation methods
and pumps (for oil only). However, we do not directly observe whether firms have
employed these secondary and tertiary extraction techniques to increase flow rates.

Data Sources

We use well-level data aggregated by Drillinginfo, a company that provides information services on upstream oil and natural gas activity. We focus on wells drilled

9

in the state of Texas because of the superior quality of the data from that state.7
Texas onshore wells account for approximately 30 percent of total U.S. natural gas
production, and it has accounted for more than 40 percent of the growth in production since 2000.8 In Texas, Drillinginfo collects onshore well data from the
Texas Railroad Commission. The data include natural gas wells going back many
decades, but we focus on wells drilled between January 2000 and September 2015.
We downloaded the Drillinginfo dataset on June 9, 2016.
The dataset describes characteristics of each well that do not vary over time including the wells’ important dates (spud and first production dates), the geographical location of the well, the direction the well is drilled (horizontal versus vertical),
and the reservoir into which the well was drilled. The dataset also includes the
time series of each well’s natural gas and oil production for each month over the
well’s productive lifetime. In Texas, natural gas production is measured at the well
level, while oil production is measured at the lease level. Drillinginfo allocated oil
production to individual wells using well test data.
We drop apparently duplicated observations and observations with missing or
invalid dates (e.g., the first production date is reported to occur before the well is
reported to be completed).9 We focus on natural gas wells, ignoring oil wells. We
7

The data for other regions tend to be inferior because certain variables are unavailable, defined
differently, or reported less frequently. For example, in New Mexico, drilling direction is not reliably
tracked; in Pennsylvania, production is reported at the annual level, compared to monthly in Texas.

9
These occasional inconsistencies are primarily due to the way Drillinginfo updates data on reentered wells. For example, a well that initially began production in 1995, but was later re-worked
and re-completed in 2010, would have a first production date of 1995, but a 2010 completion date.
In these cases, the original completion date would be overwritten in Drillinginfo’s data by the more
recent 2010 completion. We also drop some wells because they report beginning production more
than 24 months after their spud date. These are likely data errors because permits generally expire
after two years, and leases typically expire if production does not begin within three to five years.

also compute the length of horizontal well “laterals” using the geodesic distance
between the well’s surface hole and bottom hole.
We categorize a well as unconventional if it is drilled in a low-permeability
or shale reservoir using horizontal or directional drilling techniques. Reservoirs
were classified using a dataset provided by the Energy Information Administration
(EIA) that maps labels field and reservoir names as either “conventional,” “low
permeability,” or “shale.”10 Correspondingly, a conventional well is defined as a
well that is drilled vertically into a conventional reservoir.11
Unless otherwise noted, we use the simple average of the next 12 months of
futures prices for natural gas price (Henry Hub) and oil (WTI). Each price is the
average of daily prices collected from Bloomberg and adjusted to 2014 dollars using
the CPI All Urban Consumer (All Items) index.

Data Description

The cleaned dataset includes approximately 62,000 gas wells drilled between 2000
and 2015. For unconventional wells, we only include wells drilled in 2005 or later,
as this is the period when the shale gas revolution began in earnest. Figure 1 shows
a map illustrating the location of the wells in our data along with depictions of
10

Approximately half of the wells matched perfectly to EIA’s dataset. The remaining wells were
matched using the most similar reservoir name according to the Levenshtein distance between the
two text strings, which equals the number of character changes required to obtain a perfect match.
78 percent of the wells matched perfectly after changing no more than 1 character in the reservoir
name; 93 percent matched perfectly after changing no more than 4 characters. Many such matches
are either misspellings, abbreviations, or spelling variants (e.g., “Barnett shell,” or “Eagle Ford” versus “Eagleford”) or alternatively include extra unneeded information (e.g., “Helms Barnett shale”).
Inspection of the results suggests the match performs well. For example, very few wells classified
as “shale” appear before 2000.
11
“Mixed” wells (i.e., a vertical well in a shale reservoir, or a horizontal/directional well in a
conventional reservoir) are dropped from the analysis, although there are relatively few of these.

Unconventional wells are much more productive than their conventional counterparts. On average, an unconventional gas well in our data produced nearly 70,000
thousand cubic feet (mcf) of natural gas in its first full month,13 compared to ap12

Decline rates represent decline from peak production, which is not necessarily the first full
month. Means, medians, and standard deviations are taken over relevant subsets of the data. For
example, wells that produced no oil are excluded from the calculation regarding oil decline rates.
13
Initial production is measured as production during its first full month of production, meaning
the second calendar month during which production is reported. It is standard to focus on the second
month because a well is typically only producing for a fraction of its first calendar month.

12

proximately 30,000 mcf from a conventional gas well, meaning on average over this
sample period (2000-2015 for conventional and 2005-2015 for unconventional),
unconventional wells are 2.3 times as productive. However, this average masks
trends in productivity (shown below in Figure 4); per-well productivity has been
rising substantially for unconventional wells and falling slightly for conventional
wells. Over the 2010-2014 period,14 the average initial production for unconventional wells was 80,000 mcf per month (not shown in table), 2.7 times as productive
as the average conventional well (30,000 mcf over 2000-2015, as shown in Table
1).
Comparing the averages and medians illustrates the greater predictability of
unconventional wells by capturing the relative skewness of conventional drilling.
Many conventional wells end up producing relatively little, but the occasional “gusher”
compensates for the unproductive ones. The average and median production values
are more similar for unconventional wells (mean of about 68,000 mcf versus a median of about 50,000 mcf), the mean being about 37 percent higher than the median,
compared to conventional wells, for which the mean is more than twice as large as
the median (about 30,000 mcf versus 14,000 mcf).
14
We exclude 2015 from this computation because that rise is potentially due to temporary refocusing of efforts on “sweet spots” during low oil and gas prices, rather than persistent innovation.

This greater predictability of unconventional wells is also demonstrated by the
standard deviation of their initial gas production relative to conventional wells. The
coefficient of variation (the standard deviation divided by the mean) is much smaller
for unconventional gas wells (1.0), compared to conventional wells (1.8).
On average, we do not observe a substantial difference in decline rates between
unconventional and conventional gas wells—somewhat contrary to conventional
wisdom. Decline rates measure the rate of change in production levels for a given
well beginning with the peak period, typically but not always the first full calendar
month of production. Unconventional gas wells extract more natural gas in earlier
periods because they are much larger on average. Unconventional gas wells also
have more consistent decline rates than conventional wells, as demonstrated by the
lower standard deviations for the decline rates for unconventional wells in Table 1.
According to industry participants, unconventional wells are more expensive to
drill and complete than conventional wells, so the gain in physical well productivity

14

also comes with higher costs. The primary costs associated with developing an
oil or gas well are associated with renting rigs during the drilling and completion
stages. These expenses depend on the amount of time the rigs are working on site,
which depends in turn on the depth of the well and the length of its laterals, also
summarized in Table 1. Average lateral lengths have been rising at a remarkably
linear pace over that period (not shown), from about 2,000 feet in 2005 to about
6,000 feet in 2015, with an average of about 4,000 feet over the full sample period.
Further, in section III.C we consider the length of time between spudding and first
production, which is greater for unconventional wells due to the extra steps required
to hydraulically fracture the well: unconventional gas wells begin producing within
4.7 months, on average, compared to 2.5 months for conventional gas wells.
Figure 2 shows the production profiles for two typical gas wells in our data, both
of which began producing in 2007. The unconventional well is located in Johnson
County, TX, overlaying the Barnett shale play. The conventional well is located in
Shelby County, TX, in the East Texas Basin. This graph and Table 1 illustrate that
while the level-decline in gas production is larger for the unconventional well, the
conventional and unconventional wells have quite similar percentage decline rates.
As shown in Table 1, after 12 months of production, the mean unconventional well’s
gas flow has fallen by about 40,000 mcf from its peak of 68,000 mcf, a drop of 59
percent. In the same amount of time, the mean conventional well’s production fell
by about 17,000 mcf from its peak of about 30,000 mcf, which is a comparable 56
percent reduction.

counts are plotted along with natural gas and oil prices.15 The figure reveals that
the wells we have classified as unconventional are indeed a recent phenomenon,
supporting our classification method. Following the massive increase in unconventional drilling and collapse in gas prices, conventional gas wells have all but
disappeared.
As shown in the figure, gas drilling fell dramatically after the collapse of gas
prices in 2008. Natural gas prices continued to decline in the subsequent years,
during which the number of conventional gas wells drilled fell by 70 percent, while

this asymmetric relationship in detail in section III.
Figure 4 shows trends in the productivity of unconventional and conventional
gas wells from 2000 to 2015 (2005-2015 for unconventional, as explained at the
beginning of this subsection), measured by the average first full month of production of all wells drilled in the prior two quarters.17 The figure shows the increase
in average unconventional well productivity, which has nearly doubled since 2005.

These numbers are the changes in total wells drilled for each well type in 2012, relative to 2010.
We use a two-quarter average to avoid the noise that would be created by focusing only on wells
drilled in individual months, some of which involve small numbers of observations, particularly
given the small number of of conventional wells drilled in recent years as illustrated in Figure 3.

This productivity improvement demonstrates how, for a given price of gas, each unconventional well has generated increasing revenue, and thus how focusing solely
on gas prices can misstate changes in the revenues gained from drilling.
To conclude, while the data focus on only Texas gas wells, these figures and
summary statistics illustrate that our dataset is consistent with commonly-discussed

Models and Results

III.A

Overview

We divide our analysis of the natural gas production process into three stages: the
decision to commence drilling (or “spud”) a well, how quickly to complete and
start production at a well (conditional on spudding), and how quickly to extract gas
from the well (conditional on first producing a well). We describe our analysis of
the spud decision in section III.B, the completion and production start decision in
section III.C, and the profile of the quantity produced in section III.D. Finally, we
integrate the analysis of each of these different stages in section III.E.

III.B
III.B.1

Stage 1: Commence Drilling (Spud) a Well
Drilling Estimation Method

Our empirical specification represents drilling activity as a log-linear approximation
of the expected profits from drilling, which is a function of the expected present
value of the future stream of revenues and costs associated with different types of
gas wells. Recall that gas wells may produce oil in addition to gas (see Table 1),
meaning that oil prices may affect the incentive to drill gas wells.
We estimate the relationship in first differences because both drilling activity
and our oil & gas revenue variables are non-stationary time series, while they are
stationary after taking first differences. This leads to the following specification for
the number of gas wells drilled:

∆ ln(wt ) = β0 +

L
X

[β1,l ∆ ln(p̃gas,t−l q̃gas,t−l ) + β2,l ∆ ln(p̃oil,t−l q̃oil,t−l )] + γ 0 (∆Xt ) + εt (1)

l=0

19

where wt represents the number of wells that are spudded during period t, which is
measured in quarters. Expected revenue in each period is equal to a well’s expected
cumulative output of gas and oil (denoted q̃gas,t and q̃oil,t respectively) multiplied
by the price (p̃gas,t and p̃oil,t ) expected to be received for each type of output (in
present value equivalents). Xt is an optional vector of cost controls for wells drilled
in period t (all measured in logs). The primary parameters of interest are β1,l , which
represent the l-lagged elasticity of gas well drilling. We include L = 2 quarterly
lags of the revenue variables to account for the fact that drilling a well takes time
due to the need to obtain mineral rights, drilling permits, contracts with drilling
service companies, and transport drilling rigs to well sites. In this specification, the
P
long-run drilling elasticity with respect to gas prices18 is given by Ll=0 β1,l .
The advantage of using expected revenue as an explanatory variable, rather than
simply gas and oil prices as in many other studies, is twofold. First, it more closely
reflects the reality that the incentive to drill a well depends on the well’s total revenue, which depends in turn on the well’s overall productivity rather than the price
of one unit of its output. Second, the changes to well productivity contribute an
additional source of revenue variation in the data. Intuitively, a 10 percent increase
in production has the same revenue impact as a 10 percent increase in output prices.
For the expected future prices of gas and oil p̃t , we use the simple average of the
next 12 months of futures prices for Henry Hub natural gas and WTI oil, adjusted
for inflation (see section II.B). This captures the fact that drilling decisions yield a
stream of production (and profits) over the course of the coming months into the
18
We do not distinguish between “revenue” or “price” elasticities since they are equivalent, due to
the equality β1,l ln(p̃gas,t−l q̃gas,t−l ) = β1,l ln(p̃gas,t−l ) + β1,l ln(q̃gas,t−l ). Intuitively, a 1 percent
increase in prices is equivalent to a 1 percent increase in revenues, holding productivity constant.

20

future. Due to discounting and the relatively rapid decline in production from oil
and gas wells (see Table 1), much of the present value revenue from oil and gas
wells depends on prices in the first year or so of production.19
Because we do not observe each firm’s expectations about well productivity
(q̃gas,t and q̃oil,t ), we proxy for it using the measure of recent gas well productivity
described in section II.C and plotted in Figure 4.20 Our preferred specifications do
not include controls, but including average well depth and lateral lengths as cost
controls has little effect on the results.21
Studies of U.S. oil supply elasticities have typically not instrumented for oil
prices based on the historically plausible argument that incremental production
from the United States (and Texas in particular) is small relative to the global oil
market. This argument is less sound for natural gas, which is primarily a North
American market and has been strongly affected by the shale gas boom. In addition, the shale revolution has arguably played some role in the drop in oil prices
in 2014 and 2015, raising new concerns about the endogeneity of oil prices. For
these reasons, we instrument for both of our contemporaneous oil and gas revenue
variables.22
19

Conversations with industry participants also confirm that using futures prices is a reasonable
approach for two other reasons: producers often look to futures markets for price expectations and/or
hedge their output prices (at least for their wells’ initial and most productive months).
20
Specifically, we use the average initial production values (first full month) for wells drilled in
the prior two quarters. Because production profiles decline quickly (Table 1), production in the
first full month is a fairly reliable indicator of a well’s long-term productivity. The correlation
between first-month production and first-year production is 0.89, and for mature wells in the data
that have produced the vast majority of their output, the correlation between first-month production
and cumulative production is 0.72.
21
The cost measures chosen are intuitive and comport with suggestions from industry operators.
22
We do not instrument for lagged revenues. For 1- and 2-quarter lagged oil and gas prices to be
potentially endogenous, one must argue that traders can anticipate changes in drilling activity and
hence production as far as 9 months in advance and for prices to immediately adjust based on those

21

We use four instruments: U.S. population-weighted heating degree days (HDD),
cooling degree days (CDD), lagged U.S. working gas inventories, and copper prices.23
We include both contemporaneous values and up to three quarterly lags of these instruments, with the exception of gas inventories for which we only use the lagged
values because the contemporaneous value is likely endogenous to gas prices.
The first three instruments are standard gas demand shifters. The final instrument, copper prices, is included as a proxy for global commodity demand to instrument for oil prices, inspired by Hamilton (2014). Indeed, the copper and oil prices
are highly correlated (0.92 in levels and 0.71 in log-differences during 2000 Q1 2015 Q3), suggesting that the price of copper is a reasonable proxy for commodity
demand shocks that also affect oil demand. Unless otherwise noted, all results are
estimated using two stage least squares (2SLS).
To show the importance of the instruments and of the non-stationarity of the
time series, we also present un-instrumented and un-differenced results. We also
present estimation results separately for unconventional and conventional gas wells
to test whether the drilling response is different for unconventional wells. The sample period begins in 2000 Q1 and ends 2015 Q3, and the unit of observation is one
quarter. All standard errors are HAC robust.
anticipations. Given that we are using quarterly data and that drilling activity is generally considered
very difficult to forecast, we find this argument implausible and treat lagged revenues as exogenous.

III.B.2

Drilling Estimation Results

Table 2 shows the results of estimating equation (1). The first three rows report the
estimated price elasticity of drilling for 0, 1, and 2 quarterly lags of gas revenues.
The sum of these effects is the long-run price elasticity (and revenue elasticity more
generally), also reported in the middle of the table along with standard errors. Our
preferred specification is the simplest one, found in column (1), finding a longrun drilling elasticity of 0.66, significant at the 1 percent level.24 Column (2) adds
cost controls, average vertical depth and lateral lengths, to the specification; these
controls have little effect on the magnitude or significance of the long-run elasticity.
Columns (3) and (4) show results from re-estimating equation (1) separately for
unconventional and conventional gas wells, including computing well productivity
and revenues separately for each of these well types.25 Despite using very different
drilling activity and productivity variables (e.g., see Figures 3 and 4), the estimated
elasticities (0.64 and 0.65) are very similar to each other and to the result found for
both well types combined (0.66) shown in column (1). From this we conclude that
there is no meaningful difference between the drilling elasticity for unconventional
and conventional gas wells, supporting our preferred specification in column (1).
Column (5) shows the results of estimating the relationship without instruments.
The long-run elasticities are somewhat smaller, as would be expected with endogenous gas and/or oil prices. Indeed, the Wu-Hausman tests reject the null of no
endogeneity in every specification. Moreover, Sargan tests cannot reject the null
24
This result is robust to using simple prices instead of our revenue variables. We still prefer to
use our revenue variables because we believe they are more accurate depictions of firm incentives.
25
For column (3)–the unconventional-only estimation–we focus on the 2005-2015 sample period
for the reasons described above. Further, the small number of unconventional wells in the early
2000s leads to noisy and unreliable productivity estimates for revenues before 2005.

23

that our overidentifying restrictions are valid,26 . This supports the need for and
validity of the IV approach and our preference for the specification in column (1).
Columns (6) and (7) show the results of estimating the model in levels, with and
without instruments. Given the non-stationarity of the time series, this approach
would tend to be biased towards finding a large and spurious relationship, and indeed we find a long-run gas drilling elasticity naively estimated to be approximately
1.6. Ignoring the non-stationarity of the time series thus threatens to significantly
overstate the gas elasticity.
In addition, the estimated relationship of gas drilling to oil prices changes sign
when estimating in levels. Oil prices were high during the 2009-2014 period, during the time when aggregate gas drilling declined (mostly conventional, arguably
due to falling gas prices, see Figure 3), creating a negative correlation between gas
drilling and oil prices in levels. Taking differences avoids naively interpreting these
diverging, non-stationary trends as causal and identifies a positive relationship between oil prices and gas drilling. Further, the elasticity with respect to oil prices is
similar in size to the elasticity with respect to gas prices, consistent with operators
being indifferent between the gas-versus-oil composition of their revenue streams.
Our estimate, 0.66, is similar to those derived from other recent sources. Hausman and Kellogg (2015) estimate a long-run drilling elasticity of 0.81 using a different methodology and smaller sample.27 In addition, the long-run gas supply
elasticity implied by the EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2015 is approximately 0.5.
26
Based on 2 endogenous variables (gas and oil revenues) and 15 instruments: 0-3 lagged differences of HDD, CDD, and copper prices, along with 1-3 lagged differences of gas inventories.
27
That paper estimated the relationship in levels, rather than differences, which may in part explain their somewhat higher elasticity. Among other differences between our analyses, they used a
different data source that could not distinguish between unconventional and conventional drilling.

24

In the next two sections we build on the analysis of the drilling decision assessed
in this section and consider the subsequent stages of the production process. In section III.C we analyze the amount of time it takes for a well to begin producing once
it is drilled. In section III.D we analyze the time profile of wells’ gas production.

III.C
III.C.1

Stage 2: Spud-to-Production Time
Duration Model

Once a well is spudded, production does not typically begin until at least a month
later (see Table 1), and we find that there is considerable variation in how long
each well takes to reach initial production. After spudding the well, the time to
finish drilling the well depends on factors like well depth and the length of well
laterals. The completion stage follows the drilling stage and may require artificially
fracturing the well, which also increases the time to production. After completion,
the well can begin producing natural gas and oil. Other factors that might influence
completion times are fuel prices—whereby operators work faster when prices are
higher to achieve revenues earlier—and logistics like renting a completion rig.
Figure 5 shows non-parametric kernel density estimates of the distributions for
the spud-to-production time, separately for conventional and unconventional gas
wells. Consistent with Table 1, unconventional wells tend to take longer to reach
production, due to the additional labor required to horizontally drill and fracture.
To estimate the distribution of spud-to-completion times as a function of prices,
we use duration models (i.e., survival time or hazard models) with time-varying
coefficients. Denote the hazard function of well i of type j (conventional or unconventional) and beginning production t months after it was spudded by:

where f (t, Xi,j,t , θj ) is the density function of the spud-to-production time, and
F (t, Xi,j,t , θj ) is the corresponding cumulative distribution function. Xi,j,t is a
vector of explanatory variables, some of which may change over time (for example,
gas and oil prices can and do change over time). Hence, the hazard function describes the probability that a well with characteristics Xi,j,t will begin production t
months after it was spudded, given that it has not yet begun producing.
We estimate this model using maximum likelihood by assuming an underlying
density f (·) to specify the form of the baseline hazard function. We focus on using the generalized gamma distribution, which is a very flexible distribution that is

27

parameterized by two ancillary parameters determining the shape of the distribution.28 We found that the gamma distribution results in an estimated distribution
that closely resembles the non-parametric distributions shown in Figure 5 and also
yields a significantly higher log-likelihood than other alternatives.29
A hazard model estimated with the gamma distribution is parameterized in an
“accelerated failure time” (AFT) setup. In this setup, the explanatory variables can
be interpreted as additively affecting the observation’s logged expected “failure”
time, which here is the time it takes for a spudded well to reach production. This
implies that if an increase in gas prices encourages operators to work faster to speed
up the time of production, this would be represented as a negative coefficient in the
AFT model (i.e., reducing the time to production).
We estimate the hazard models for each unconventional and conventional wells
independently, with no cross-equation restrictions. This allows each well type to
have its own distribution, in addition to its own estimated parameters. As in the
drilling regressions in section III.B, the explanatory variables include (in logs): expected revenue from gas and oil production,30 and cost controls of well depths and

We test the Weibull, exponential, Gompertz, Log-normal, and Log-logistic distributions. Several of these distributions are special cases of the gamma distribution (namely, the Weibull, exponential, and log-normal distributions). For those nested distributions we can test for whether the
gamma distribution’s better fit is statistically significant: we find it is in all cases. We also compared
the results to a Cox proportional hazards model, which leaves the baseline hazard unspecified: the
key estimates were generally in the same directions and of similar relative sizes.
30
As before, the results are robust to simply using gas and oil prices, but we use the revenue
variables as we believe they are more accurate depictions of firms’ incentives. We do not use instrumental variables as the theoretical and empirical literature for implementing them in duration

28

lateral lengths. We also explore the possibility that spud-to-completion times are
affected by drilling experience by including a cumulative count of unconventional
gas wells drilled as another control.
The unit of observation is a well-month, which means we can use well-specific
characteristics (lateral length and well depth) rather than the means across wells
used in the drilling equations of the prior section. Nonetheless, even though we observe wells’ realized production, we do not use it because firms do not know with
certainty how productive a well will be until it actually starts producing. Hence, using the well’s actual, ex post production as an explanatory variable would imply that
the firm responds to unobservable information. Instead, we use the same method of
calculating productivity and revenues used in the drilling equations.31 In the terminology of hazard analysis, we consider a well to be “at risk” of being produced for
24 months following its spud month, at which point it exits our sample.32

III.C.2

Spud-to-Production Duration Estimation Results

Table 3 shows the estimates of the duration models. Our preferred estimates are
again the simplest ones, shown in columns (1) and (4) for unconventional and conventional wells respectively. The first coefficient reported in column (1) is -0.172,
indicating that a 10 percent increase in the gas price (or revenues more generally)
is expected to reduce the time to production for an unconventional well by less than
2 percent. Across columns (1) through (3), unconventional wells have generally
models is very limited. We are aware of only one published paper, MacKenzie et al. (2014), that
considers the implementation of instrumental variables in duration models; that study only applies
to a Cox proportional hazard setup, as opposed to the accelerated failure time model that we use.
31
Since we conduct the hazard analysis at the monthly level, average revenues are calculated on a
monthly basis, rather than quarterly.

We chose 24 months for the reasons described in section II.B

consistent price response coefficients between -0.06 and -0.17. The corresponding
responses for conventional wells, found in columns (4) through (6), are somewhat
more modest, with coefficients in the range of -0.08 to -0.10.33

Increases in oil revenues seem to slightly discourage conventional natural gas
efforts, potentially representing a substitution effect, while having more muted and
ambiguous effects on unconventional effort. The coefficient on lateral lengths sensibly indicates that unconventional wells with longer laterals take longer to reach production, consistent with longer drilling and completion periods. Well depth plays an
analogous role for conventional wells: deeper wells take longer to reach production.
The “learning” proxy variable (unconventional spud counts) has a counter-intuitive
sign in the unconventional equation in column (3). However, this variable grows

These results are robust to including lagged oil and gas revenues. The coefficients on the lagged
values were small and generally insignificant. The sum of the contemporaneous and lagged coefficients were very similar to the coefficients reported in Table 3.

roughly linearly in time, and it therefore acts similarly to a time trend, and is therefore ambiguous to interpret. It is indicative that spud-to-production times have not
obviously fallen with experience. Indeed, the average spud-to-production time for
unconventional wells during 2005-2009 was 4.1 months, compared to 5.2 months
for 2010-2015. This positive coefficient on the cumulative spud counts cannot entirely be explained by longer lateral lengths, because this variable is included in
equation (3). Regardless, these controls do not substantially affect the qualitative
conclusions regarding the price responsiveness of spud-to-production times.
The shape of the gamma distribution of spud-to-production time is also estimated in the model, separately for each well type. The resulting shapes are plotted
in Figure 6 at covariate means, along with the same non-parametric, kernel density estimate of the underlying distribution shown in Figure 5. The fitted gamma
distributions strongly resemble the non-parametrically estimated densities, suggesting that the gamma distribution fits the true baseline hazard distribution well and
is not driving the coefficient estimates. The estimated shape also demonstrates that
monotonic functional forms (exponential, Gompertz, Weibull) would be inappropriate. While the gas price response coefficients are precisely estimated and their
signs are consistent with economic expectations, they are small. For example, in
order to achieve a 10 percent reduction in spud-to-production time for conventional
wells, gas prices would have to nearly triple. For the more-responsive unconventional wells, gas prices would have to nearly double.34
This lack of strong price response is illustrated in Figure 7. That figure plots
the parameterized gamma distributions for each well type under alternative natural
34
These required price changes represent the change in gas prices needed to shift the fitted distribution, computed at covariate means, such that the mean of the distribution decreases by 10 percent.

gas price assumptions of $3.00 and $6.00 per million Btu.35 The effects are not
large. Despite an assumed doubling of natural gas prices, the effect on the spud-toproduction time distribution is modest.
These results suggest that once drilling has commenced, gas prices do not strongly
influence the decision about whether and how fast to begin producing a well. This
is sensible, since once drilling has begun, much of the well development costs have
been sunk. There also may be limited opportunities for speeding up the completion

Stage 3: Production Profile over Time
Production Profile Estimation Method

The final stage of the gas production process is the flow of gas from wells once they
begin producing, and how that flow evolves over time. In this section, we estimate
the time profile of well-level gas production and its relationship with prices.
36

Although there is always the option to slow down or stop the completion process in the face of
low prices, this may not save costs if service contracts are already in place.

33

Once a well begins producing, it often produces gas and oil for many years, with
the production profile being determined principally by reservoir pressure. Because
the variable cost of production from an existing well is very low, an operator would
typically want to produce oil and gas at a well’s capacity. For this reason, we would
not expect gas and oil prices to have a significant effect on production from existing
wells by a competitive firm. Instead, a well’s flow rate is largely determined by the
amount of pressure left in the reservoir to force the resource to the surface. The
flow rate is therefore generally out of the operator’s control.37 These arguments are
analyzed at an aggregate level for oil in Anderson, Kellogg and Salant (2014), and
we find similar results for gas at the well level.
Even if production from existing wells is not price responsive itself, understanding the time profile of production is nonetheless still important to understanding
aggregate supply responsiveness. This is because these profiles determine the relationship between drilling effort and realized production over time, and production
profiles are quite different for unconventional versus conventional wells.
As described further in the next section, our estimates show a lack of price
response of output from existing gas wells using a detailed panel dataset describing
monthly gas production for each well’s productive life. Specifically, we run fixedeffects regressions of the form:
ln(qi,gas,j,t ) = χi + ηgas,j ln(pgas,t ) + ηoil,j ln(poil,t ) + gj (Agei,t ) + εi,j,t ,
37

(3)

There are some exceptions. Firms can extract more hydrocarbons through investments in enhanced recovery methods like pumps (for oil) and various injection methods. For unconventional
reserves, firms have the added option to re-fracture the well, which can create new fissures that
release more hydrocarbons to the surface.

34

where i indexes the well and t indexes the calendar time in months. qi,gas,j,t is the
gas production from well i of type j in month t. χi is a well-level fixed effect,
which can roughly be interpreted as initial (log) production for well i. pgas,t and
poil,t are prompt-month gas and oil prices. The parameters of interest are ηgas,j describing the contemporaneous price elasticity of gas production from a well (of type
j) that has already been drilled. We use spot (i.e., prompt-month) oil and natural gas
prices because of the immediate nature of the potential price response from existing
wells.38 Given the well-level fixed effects, our identification of the price response
comes from changes in prices during the life of a well. The discussion above and
prior evidence suggests that this parameter would be estimated as being close to
zero. Regardless, the different production profiles of wells can still be consequential for the overall supply responsiveness to prices because this stage is conditioned
on the earlier drilling decision, which we found above is responsive to price.
Agei,t is the age of well i at time t (i.e., the number of months since it began
production). gj (Agei,t ) is a function of the age of a well of type j, and we allow
for flexible production profiles by approximating this function using polynomials
of varying degrees as well as a cubic spline.39 We conduct specification tests to
select among these alternative flexible functional forms. We drop the first month of
production, as wells are often only operating for a fraction of this month, instead beginning with the first full month of production. The age function is indexed by j to
allow the average production profile to vary based on well type (i.e., unconventional
versus conventional). Standard errors are clustered at the well level.
38
39

Using lagged prices does not substantially affect the results.
The cubic spline uses knots at every 12-month interval after initial production.

35

III.D.2

Production Profile Estimation Results

Table 4 contains the results for the fixed effects regressions for unconventional and
conventional gas wells. Consistent with the above discussion, we find very small
coefficients on natural gas prices, suggesting that gas production from existing wells
is not price responsive. The elasticity point estimates are small, typically ranging
between +0.09 and -0.04 (with one exception in column (5), discussed below), all
very close to zero and often of a theoretically implausible sign. The same is true
for oil price coefficients, which are generally very close to zero and occasionally
insignificant despite small standard errors.40
The substantial size of our dataset (over 5 million well-month observations for
conventional and unconventional wells combined) generates very small standard
errors. As a result, even many of these very small estimates (e.g., smaller than 0.02
in magnitude) are nevertheless significant at the 1 percent level. These negligible
elasticity estimates are generally robust to variations in the functional form describing the decline path. Polynomials of orders one through four and cubic splines
produce similar results. The linear-in-age specification in column (1) is probably
insufficiently flexible because production is commonly observed to decline slowerthan-exponentially (as captured by a positive “b” parameter in the Arps equation),
and a linear specification effectively assumes an exponential decline. We find support for slower-than-exponential declines in the significant positive coefficient on
the well-age-squared terms in columns (2) through (4). We also include a specification using log(Agei,t ), following Patzek, Male and Marder (2013) who argue for
40

Excluding oil prices from the specification completely (not shown) also has little effect on the
results, except in column (1), where it shrinks the gas price coefficients even closer towards zero.

such a specification for unconventional gas wells in the Barnett shale formation, a
subset of our data.41
In general, we do not find a positive price response of gas production from existing wells. To our knowledge, this is the only published study that finds empirical
evidence for this proposition using well-level data. Because the negligible observed
price response from existing wells comports with both structural economic factors
and empirical evidence, we proceed to model production from existing wells as
completely unresponsive to price. This assumption also allows us to model well
production profiles non-parametrically in our combined model in Section III.E.
To represent the production profile from unconventional and conventional wells,
we use the mean monthly production in our dataset by well age. For example, to
estimate the production from an average unconventional well in its 7th month of
production, we calculate the average production from every unconventional well
in our dataset during its 7th month.42 The results of this procedure are illustrated
in Figure 8. The solid lines in that figure represent the mean production profile of
unconventional (orange) and conventional (gray) wells. The dashed lines represent
the median production profiles.
41

Patzek, Male and Marder (2013) specifically argue that the coefficient on log(Agei,t ) should
be approximately -0.50 for unconventional gas wells, but we find a somewhat larger coefficient of
-0.68. If we include each wells’ first, partial month of production, we find an estimated coefficient
of -0.52, very close to -0.50. However, including the first, partial month is inappropriate when fitting parametric decline curves, as an inspection of Figure 8 suggests. Regardless, our finding of no
meaningful price response is generally robust to including wells’ first, partial months. The only specification with an economically meaningful gas price response estimate is the one using log(Agei,t )
for conventional reservoirs, which is likely inappropriate because Patzek, Male and Marder (2013)
only advise using that functional form for unconventional Barnett wells, not conventional ones.
42
For each well that has ceased production before the end of our sample period, we impute zero
production in each month after its last month of production when calculating this average.

These production profiles reflect the well characteristics presented in Table 1.
The mean and median unconventional production profiles strongly resemble each
other, suggesting that unconventional gas production profiles are generally not very
skewed in productivity. In contrast, the median conventional well produces much
less than the mean, indicating a right-skewed distribution with some highly-productive
“jackpot” reservoirs and many relatively “dry holes.” These facts align with discussions of decline paths in industry and popular press.
However, as mentioned previously, in percentage terms, the decline curves are
not very different between unconventional and conventional wells in our data. Figure 9 shows these decline curves scaled as a percent of initial production, and all

Integrating Natural Gas Supply Stages to Measure Overall Price Responsiveness

III.E.1

Integrated Model of Well Drilling, Production, and Decline over Time

In this section, we combine the analysis of the three gas supply stages from the
preceding sections into a single integrated simulation model. The purpose of this

40

integrated model is to understand the overall price-responsiveness of natural gas
supply, how it evolves over time, and how it differs between unconventional and
conventional resources. The three separate stages of the natural gas production
process are the spud decision, the time from spudding to the first production of
a well, and the production profile of a gas well over time. We link these stages
together by simulating the effects of an unexpected, permanent 10 percent shock
to natural gas prices (from $3.00 to $3.30 per million Btu). We then illustrate the
effect of this shock on drilling activity and natural gas production over time in a
manner readily understandable in percentage and elasticity terms.
This shock increases the number of spuds of each well type in every period,
based on the elasticities presented in Table 2. The additional spudded wells take
time to reach production, according to the estimated distributions associated with
the hazard estimation results in Table 3 (illustrated in Figures 6 and 7). We then use
the mean production profile shapes presented in Figure 8 to simulate the amount
of production from wells of each type. We scale up the unconventional profile
by a factor of approximately 1.2 to reflect the higher initial productivity levels of
about 80,000 mcf per month in recent years (2010 to 2014), relative to average
levels of about 67,000 over the entire 2005 to 2015 period.43 The result is a time
series of changes in production by well type. Given this, it is straightforward to
calculate a time-varying supply elasticity by dividing the change in production (as
a percentage) by the assumed price shock (10 percent in this simulation).
43
We exclude 2015 when computing recent productivity (of 80,000 mcf) out of concern that the
large jump in productivity during that year reflects not permanent innovation but instead a temporary
re-focusing of efforts on “sweet spots” during a time of low oil & gas prices, which can be seen in
Figure 4.

41

We begin by noting that, given the number of wells drilled, the number of
wells beginning production at month t is the accumulation of wells that were spudded in recent months. We can write this relationship precisely using the spud-toproduction distributions in Table 3 (seen in equation (2) and illustrated in Figures 6
and 7). Denoting the discrete analogues of these distributions as fj,l for a well type
j beginning production l months after spudding, we can write the number of wells
beginning production at month t, denoted xj,t , as a function of fj,l and the number
of wells spudded in each of preceding 24 months, denoted wj,t , as follows:
xj,t =

24
X

wj,t−l fj,l .

(4)

l=0

Equation (4) thus combines supply stages 1 and 2: well drilling and commencement of production. Next, by combining this with stage 3—well-level production
profiles—we can calculate the total gas production over time. As in the production
profile analysis (see equation (3)), we use qgas,j,τ to denote gas production of a well
of type j in its τ th month of operation. Denoting the productive life of a well of
type j as Tj , we can write total gas production at time t from all wells of type j as:
Tj −1

Qgas,j,t =

X

xj,(t−τ ) qgas,j,τ .

(5)

τ =0

Using equations (4) and (5) and the results from the drilling, completion, and production models (sections III.B, III.C, and III.D), we can simulate the effect of a
change in prices on spuds (wj,t ), wells entering production over time (xj,t ), and
aggregate gas supply over time (Qgas,j,t ).

42

Note that it takes a significant period of time to reach a steady state in gas
production after a price shock because today’s production depends on events that
happened as long at Tj periods ago. For example, if a typical well produces for 10
years, then today’s production level depends to some degree on drilling 10 years
ago. This inertia is endemic to oil and gas supply dynamics, and it underpins much
of the cyclicality in these markets. However, since old wells produce little, the effect
of a price change is front-loaded. A key issue of interest for this paper is whether
unconventional resources and technologies may reduce the volatility inherent in this
industry characterized by large fixed investments and low variable production costs.
In our simulation’s baseline, we assume constant prices, implying that the quantity of drilling wj,t does not vary over time, denoted wjbase . Given this and equation
(4), the number of wells entering production each month in the baseline equilibrium
(i.e., without a price shock) is also constant:

24

fj,l = wjbase ,

where the latter equality follows because the density of spud-to-production time

must sum to one: 24
This and equation (5), in turn, imply that baseline

44

In reality, not all spuded wells go on to produce. However, for simplicity we are ignoring this
complication. An exploration of Drillinginfo’s permit dataset found only a small fraction of the
wells in our dataset for which we could identify as unconventional or conventional that were drilled
but never reached production. For this reason, we ignore such wells. However, including them
would simply multiplicatively scale down the price responsiveness for both well types slightly.

43

Using equations (4) through (7), we compute the number of wells beginning production and quantities of gas produced over time, by well type, under a baseline
price scenario of $3.00 per million Btu and a scenario with a permanent 10 percent
increase to $3.30 per million Btu.

III.E.2

Overall Unconventional vs. Conventional Gas Supply Responsiveness

For this analysis of the supply impact of a 10 percent gas price increase, we use our
preferred estimates for spud elasticities from columns (1) of Tables 2 and 3. The
production profiles are represented by the mean production over time for each well
type, shown by the solid lines in Figure 8, with the unconventional profile scaled up
to reflect productivity increases, as described above.
We must also specify how many wells of each type are drilled in the baseline.
To capture the relative supply elasticities, we run the simulation separately for unconventional and conventional wells, each time assuming the same spud baseline
base
base
= 72.45 From these baselines,
= 72 or wunconv
of 72 wells for each type: wconv

we simulate the time series of the number of new wells entering production and
aggregate gas production for each type of well.
We then convert the change in wells beginning production and gas produced to
percentage changes. To compare the results for unconventional and conventional
wells on an equal footing, when computing the percentage changes in gas production, we divide by the same denominator in each case: the amount of gas consistent
45

72 is the average number of monthly unconventional gas spuds in our data during our final
sample year, January 2015 - September 2015. The breakdown was 61 unconventional spuds and 11
conventional spuds. We use the same baseline for unconventional and conventional spuds in order to
conduct the thought experiments, “what would the price responsiveness look like if all gas drilling
were conventional (unconventional)?” Using a different baseline for the two well types would bias
the comparison towards the one with the larger baseline.

44

with the types of wells actually drilled in our data, on average, in 2015.46 This equal
denominator allows one to observe that, even if more conventional wells existed in
2015 than actually did (72 instead of 11), their much lower productivity means that
they would still contribute relatively little to the overall gas supply response.
The simulation results are shown in Figure 10. The left panel shows the change
in number of wells beginning production each month for unconventional and conventional wells as a percentage of the baseline number of wells. The price shock at
period zero leads to new drilling effort which gradually bears fruit over the course
of the subsequent 24 months and beyond. After 24 months, the wells reach a new

The baseline gas production corresponds to the production from 61 unconventional gas wells
and 11 conventional gas wells, computed in steady state using the average production profiles used
in this simulation and depicted in Figure 8. The amount is simply the cumulative total production
across the average well’s lifetime, by well type, multiplied by the baseline number of spuds (61 and

which shows a similar gradual adjustment. Each incremental well in the left panel
produces for many years; as a result, the rising drilling effort builds on itself, until
we reach a new steady state after more than a decade. Before reaching the steady
state, some portion of the production is from “legacy” wells drilled before the price
shock. In other words, an immediate 7 percent increase in drilling effort increases
total gas production by less than 7 percent because of the lack of response from
legacy wells, at least until those wells eventually cease production and a new steady
state is reached. Only once the increased drilling effort has propagated throughout
the system does it fully affect the level of gas produced.
The primary finding is that unconventional gas supply is in fact much more
responsive to price changes than is conventional gas supply once one takes an integrated view of the entire production process. The time and shape of the path to reach
the steady state depends on both the shape of the spud-to-production distributions
and the production profiles. The more front-loaded the distribution and production
profile are, the faster the drilling effort translates into increased production.
Note that these effects are partly, but not completely, offsetting for unconventional wells. On one hand, unconventional wells are more productive than conventional wells (see Figure 8). This supports the notion that unconventional gas
production should respond more to a price change than conventional wells would.
On the other hand, unconventional wells generally take longer to reach production (see Figure 6), which somewhat moderates the short-term effects of increased
drilling effort on gas production. Note that the superior productivity of unconventional wells more than offsets their longer drilling and completion times after
just a few months. On net, for the first three months of the simulation, unconven-

tional gas actually responds less than conventional gas as wells take longer to bring
online. But unconventional production quickly surpasses conventional production
after three months, once the much-more productive wells come online. By the 11th
month of the simulation, the unconventional gas supply response is more than twice
as large as the conventional response.
The right-hand panel of Figure 10 illustrates that, in the long run, the gas supply
response from unconventional wells is about 2.7 times (≈

7.1 percent
)
2.6 percent

larger than that

of conventional wells. This is entirely due to the fact that unconventional wells
are about 2.7 times as productive as conventional wells, with initial production of
approximately 80,000 mcf per month compared to 30,000 mcf per month.

Conclusion

We empirically analyze drilling and production from approximately 62,000 gas
wells in Texas from 2000 to 2015 to examine whether unconventional gas supply is in fact more responsive to price changes than conventional sources, as has
been widely conjectured. We consider separate stages of the natural gas extraction
process: drilling investment, time to completion and initial production, and the profile of output over time. We find that neither production from existing wells nor
completion times respond strongly to price changes. Rather, the important margin
for supply response is drilling investment. We estimate a drilling elasticity with
respect to gas prices of approximately 0.7, finding no evidence that this elasticity is
different for unconventional versus conventional gas wells.
We also find other relevant differences between conventional and unconventional wells. While unconventional wells tend to take longer to reach production,

47

they produce much more gas per well than conventional wells and have much lower
percent variation in production, consistent with the notion of a manufacturing process. The faster flow rate per well turns out to be the primary margin by which aggregate supply from unconventional gas production is more price-responsive than
conventional reservoirs. In particular, we find an approximately 2.7-fold greater
responsiveness of unconventional gas supply to price changes compared to conventional gas, due entirely to greater well productivity. This distinction is critical in an
industry where drilling rigs are a major cost factor and the total number of operating
rigs is slow to change. Among other important results, this research demonstrates
why simply counting wells drilled or rigs operating is no longer sufficient to gauge
changes in gas supply, without also measuring heterogeneity in well productivity.
