How Do Venture Capitalists Make Decisions?

JEL No. G24,G3,L26
ABSTRACT
We survey 885 institutional venture capitalists (VCs) at 681 firms to learn how they make
decisions across eight areas: deal sourcing; investment selection; valuation; deal structure; postinvestment value-added; exits; internal firm organization; and relationships with limited partners.
In selecting investments, VCs see the management team as more important than business related
characteristics such as product or technology. They also attribute more of the likelihood of
ultimate investment success or failure to the team than to the business. While deal sourcing, deal
selection, and post-investment value-added all contribute to value creation, the VCs rate deal
selection as the most important of the three. We also explore (and find) differences in practices
across industry, stage, geography and past success. We compare our results to those for CFOs
(Graham and Harvey 2001) and private equity investors (Gompers, Kaplan and Mukharlyamov
forthcoming).

Introduction

Over the past 30 years, venture capital (VC) has been an important source of financing for innovative
companies. Firms supported by VC, including Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Gilead Sciences, Google,
Intel, Microsoft, Starbucks, and Whole Foods have had a large impact on the U.S. and global economy.
Kaplan and Lerner (2010) estimate that roughly one-half of all true IPOs are VC-backed even though
fewer than one quarter of 1% of companies receive venture financing. Gornall and Strebulaev (2015)
estimate that public companies that previously received VC backing account for one-fifth of the
market capitalization and 44% of the research and development spending of U.S. public companies.
Consistent with this company-level performance, Harris, Jenkinson and Kaplan (2014, 2016) find
that, on average, VC funds have outperformed the public markets net of fees.
In this paper, we seek to better understand what venture capitalists (VCs) do and, potentially, why
they have been successful. We do so by surveying almost nine hundred VCs and asking how they
make decisions about their investments and portfolios. We provide detailed information on VCs’
practices in sourcing deals, evaluating and selecting investments, structuring investments, managing
deals post-investment, organizing their VC firms, and managing their relationships with limited
partners. We also explore cross-sectional variation in VC practices across industry, stage, geography
and past success.
The success of VC-backed companies is consistent with VCs taking actions that are effective at
generating value. In fact, Kaplan and Strömberg (2001) and Gompers and Lerner (2001) argue that
VCs are particularly successful at solving an important problem in market economies—connecting
entrepreneurs with good ideas (but no money) with investors who have money (but no ideas). The
solution, as suggested by theory and explored empirically in previous research on VCs, involves
specific actions taken by VCs to solve this funding gap. In other words, VCs are real world entities
that arguably approximate investors in economic theory, providing an additional reason to study
them.
Our survey results can be grouped into eight areas: deal sourcing; investment selection; valuation;
deal structure; post-investment value-add; exits; internal organization of firms; and relationships with
limited partners.

2

First, we consider how VCs source potential investments, a process also known as generating deal flow.
Sahlman (1990) discusses the process by which VCs attract would-be entrepreneurs. The VC’s network
is critical in this process. VC firms speak of the “deal funnel” by which opportunities are winnowed
down to a small number of investable deals. We explore where VCs’ investment opportunities come
from and how they sort through those opportunities.
Second, we examine VC investment selection decisions. There is a great deal of debate among
academics and practitioners as to which screening and selection factors are most important. Kaplan
and Strömberg (2004) describe and analyze how VCs select investments. They confirm previous survey
work that VCs consider factors that include the attractiveness of the market, strategy, technology,
product or service, customer adoption, competition, deal terms and the quality and experience of
the management team. The nature of the entrepreneurial team is an important component of the
sourcing and screening process. Baron and Hannan (2002) and Hellmann and Puri (2000) both focus
on how founding teams are formed and their attractiveness as investment opportunities. Gompers,
Kovner, Lerner and Scharfstein (2010) show that past success as an entrepreneur is an important
factor that VC firms focus on when attracting potential investments. Kaplan, Sensoy and Strömberg
(2009) develop a “jockey vs. horse” framework to examine what factors are more constant over the
life of a successful VC investment. The entrepreneurial team is the “jockey” while the strategy and
business model are the “horse”. We ask the VCs whether they focus more on the jockey or the horse
in their investment decisions.
Third, we explore the tools and assumptions that VCs utilize in valuing companies. Prior survey
evidence on financial decisions makers is mixed. Graham and Harvey (2001) find that the CFOs of large
companies generally use discounted cash flow (DCF) analyses to evaluate investment opportunities.
Gompers et al. (forthcoming), in contrast, find that PE investors rarely use DCF, preferring internal
rate of return (IRR) or multiple of invested capital. The paucity of historical operating information
and the uncertainty of future cash flows makes VCs’ investment decisions difficult and less like those
in the typical setting taught in MBA finance curricula. Given this difference, we explore the extent
to which VCs employ the commonly-taught DCF method or, instead, rely on different ones.
Fourth, we ask how VCs write contracts and structure investments. VC contracts ensure both that
(1) the entrepreneur does very well if he or she performs well and (2) that investors can take control if

3

the entrepreneur does not perform. Kaplan and Strömberg (2003) study VC contracts and show that
VCs achieve these objectives by carefully allocating cash flow rights (the equity upside that provides
incentives to perform), control rights (the rights VCs have to intervene if the entrepreneur does not
perform), liquidation rights (the senior payoff to VCs if the entrepreneur does not perform), and
employment terms, particularly vesting (which gives the entrepreneur incentives both to perform and
stay with the firm). Kaplan and Strömberg (2004) show that VC contracts are related to internal
risk; external risk; and the risk of execution. Less is known, however, about which of these terms are
more important to VCs and how they make trade-offs among them. In our survey, we ask the VCs
which investment terms they use and which terms they are willing to negotiate.
Syndication of investment with other VCs is another important element of deal structuring. Hochberg,
Ljungqvist and Lu (2007) emphasize the important role that networks play in bringing new skills
and talent to the investment team. Lerner (1994) identifies factors related to the ability of VCs to
monitor companies as being important in how VCs choose their syndicate partners. Accordingly, our
survey also explores syndication.
Fifth, we examine how VCs monitor and add value to their portfolio companies after they invest.
Part of the added value comes from improving governance and active monitoring. This often means
replacing entrepreneurs if they are not up to the task of growing their companies. For example, Baker
and Gompers (2003) find that only about one-third of VC-backed companies still have a founder
as CEO at the time of IPO. Amornsiripanitch, Gompers and Xuan (2016) show that VCs provide
critical aid in hiring outside mangers and directors. Hellmann and Puri (2002) show that VCs are
essential to the professionalization of startups. Lerner (1995) examines how VCs are influential in
the structuring of the boards of directors. In their study of investment memoranda, Kaplan and
Strömberg (2004) find direct evidence that VCs expect to add value in their investments at the time
they make them. In this survey, we further explore these issues by asking the VCs to describe in
detail the ways in which they add value.
Sixth, we ask about VCs’ exits. Barry, Muscarella, Peavy and Vetsuypens (1990) and Brav and
Gompers (1997) explore the role and importance of VCs in the performance of IPOs. Cumming (2008)
and Cumming and MacIntosh (2003) look at broad patterns in VC exits. Sørensen (2007) seeks to
establish how much of VC returns are driven by deal sourcing and investment selection versus VC

4

value-added. He concludes that both matter, with roughly a 60/40 split in importance. Accordingly,
we further explore this issue by asking the VCs directly to assess the relative importance of deal
sourcing, deal selection, and post-investment actions in value creation in their investments. We also
ask the VCs what selection factors were most important in the ultimate success and failure of their
investments.
Seventh, we explore issues related to internal VC firm structure. With respect to internal firm
issues, Gompers et al. (2010) examine how VC firm specialization affects investment performance.
Understanding internal organization potentially can shed light on whether investment focus affects
decision-making and performance.
Eighth, and finally, we consider the relationship between VCs and their investors. Chung, Sensoy,
Stern and Weisbach (2012) look at VCs’ implicit and explicit incentives to perform well. Kaplan and
Schoar (2005) and Harris et al. (2014) document patterns of fund performance and persistence. Our
survey allows us to examine the alignment of incentives as well as marketed fund return expectations.
This paper complements several existing survey papers in the financial economics literature. Graham
and Harvey (2001) survey chief financial officers to understand how they make capital budgeting,
capital structure, and other financing decisions.1 They compare their survey findings of practice
to the recommendations or insights from different academic theories. Gompers et al. (forthcoming)
survey private equity investors to understand how they make decisions, and compare their results to
those in Graham and Harvey (2001) and those taught by finance academics. In this paper, we add to
these papers by discussing how our results compare to both finance theory and the results of the
surveys of CFOs and private equity investors.
Our 885 survey respondents represent 681 different VC firms. We report results by firm, averaging the
responses for firms with multiple respondents. The average firm in our sample screens 200 companies
and makes only four investments in a given year. Most of the deal flow comes from the VCs’ networks
in some form or another. Over 30% of deals are generated through professional networks. Another
20% are referred by other investors while 8% are referred by existing portfolio companies. Almost
30% are proactively self-generated. Only 10% come inbound from company management. These
results emphasize the importance of active deal generation.

In selecting investments, VCs place the greatest importance on the management/founding team. The
management team was mentioned most frequently both as an important factor (by 95% of VC firms)
and as the most important factor (by 47% of VC firms). Business (or horse) related factors were also
frequently mentioned as important with business model at 83%, product at 74% market at 68%, and
industry at 31%. The business related factors, however, were rated as most important by only 37% of
firms. The company valuation was ranked as fifth most important overall, but third in importance
for later stage deals. Fit with fund and ability to add value were ranked as less important.
Few VCs use discounted cash flow or net present value techniques to evaluate their investments.
Instead, by far the most commonly used metric is cash-on-cash return or, equivalently, multiple of
invested capital. The next most commonly used metric is IRR. Almost none of the VCs adjusted
their target returns for systematic risk. Strikingly, 9% of the overall respondents and 17% of the
early-stage investors do not use any quantitative deal evaluation metric. Consistent with this, 20% of
all VCs and 31% of early-stage VCs reported that they do not forecast cash flows when they make an
investment. These results contrast with those in Graham and Harvey (2001) who find that CFOs use
net present values as often as internal rates of return. The results are similar to, but more extreme
than those in Gompers et al. (forthcoming) who find that private equity (PE) investor rely extensively
on IRRs and multiples of invested capital.
In structuring their investments, VCs indicated that they were relatively inflexible on pro-rata
investment rights, liquidation preferences, anti-dilution protection, vesting, valuation and board
control. They were more flexible on the option pool, participation rights, investment amount,
redemption rights, and particularly dividends. The inflexibility, particularly on control rights and
liquidation rights is arguably consistent with the results in Kaplan and Strömberg (2003, 2004).
VCs generally responded that they provide a large number of services to their portfolio companies
post-investment—strategic guidance (87%), connecting investors (72%), connecting customers (69%),
operational guidance (65%), hiring board members (58%), and hiring employees (46%). This is
consistent with VCs adding value to their portfolio companies and similar to the results for PE
investors in Gompers et al. (forthcoming).

6

Largely consistent with actual outcomes, VCs claimed they exited roughly three-fourths of their
successful deals via acquisition rather than through an IPO. VCs also report a wide variation in the
outcomes of their investments, with roughly one-quarter losing money and almost 10% earning ten
times their investment.
When asked which of their activities—deal flow, deal selection or post-investment value-added—helped
generate their returns, a majority of VCs reported that each of the three contributed with deal
selection being the most important of the three. Deal selection was ranked as important by 86% of
VCs and as most important by 49% of VCs. Post-investment value-added was seen as important by
84% of VCs and as most important by 27% of VCs. Deal flow was ranked as important by 65% and as
most important by 23%. These results are consistent with the estimates in Sørensen (2007) that deal
flow and deal selection are more important than value-add, but all three are important. These results,
however, extend and inform Sørensen (2007) by distinguishing between deal flow and deal selection.
We also asked VCs what factors contributed most to their successes and failures. Again, the team
was by far the most important factor identified, both for successes (96% of respondents) and failures
(92%). For successes, each of timing, luck, technology, business model, and industry were of roughly
equal importance (56% to 67%). For failures, each of industry, business model, technology and timing
were of roughly equal importance (45% to 58%). Perhaps surprisingly, VCs did not cite their own
contributions as a source of success or failure.
We questioned VCs on their firms’ internal structures. The average VC firm in our sample is small,
with 14 employees and 5 senior investment professionals. Consistent with the importance of both deal
sourcing and post-investment value-added, the VCs report that they spend an average of 22 hours
per week networking and sourcing deals and an average of 18 hours per week working with portfolio
companies out of a total reported work week of 55 hours.
Finally, we asked VCs about their interactions with their investors. VCs report that they believe
that their LPs care about cash-on-cash returns and net IRRs. This is similar to the results found by
Gompers et al. (forthcoming) for PE investors. Surprisingly, and like the PE investors, the majority
of VCs mention that they believe their investors care more about absolute rather than relative
performance. Finally, VCs show confidence in their ability to generate above market returns. The

7

vast majority (93%) of those surveyed answered that they expected to beat the market on a relative
basis.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes our research design and reports summary statistics.
Section 3 describes the VCs’ responses to our survey, with subsections corresponding to deal sourcing
(Section 3.1); investment selection (3.2); valuation (3.3); deal structure (3.4); post-investment valueadd (3.5); exits (3.6); internal organization of firms (3.7); and relationships with limited partners
(3.8). We highlight important cross sectional differences when relevant. Section 4 concludes.

2.1

Methodology
Design

In this section, we describe the research design of our survey. Surveys have become more common
recently in the financial economics literature. Accordingly, we reviewed many of the existing surveys
including those targeting CFOs of non-financial firms, limited partners of PE firms, and PE fund
managers, respectively, Graham and Harvey (2001); DaRin and Phalippou (2014); Gompers et al.
(forthcoming); Gorman and Sahlman (1989).
This paper is closest in spirit to the survey of private equity (PE) fund managers by Gompers et al.
(forthcoming), as the PE industry is similar to the VC industry in many respects. In particular, many
questions about investment decisions, valuation, deal structure, fund operations and the relationship
between general partners and limited partners are broadly similar in the two industries. Where
possible, we use similar questions so that we can compare the responses of VCs to those of PE
managers. The PE industry, however, focuses largely on mature or growth-stage companies, for
which financial data and forecasts are generally available. The VC industry targets companies at an
earlier stage of development, many of which have large technological and operational risks. These
differences mean that some questions, particularly those about portfolio company capital structure,
are important for PE investors but not applicable to VCs.

After developing a draft survey, we circulated it among academics and VCs for comments. We asked
four VCs to complete the draft survey and provide feedback. We also sought the advice of sociology
and marketing research experts on the survey design and execution. As a result of these efforts, we
made numerous changes to the format, style, and language of the survey questions. We then asked a
further eight VCs to take our updated survey and provide further comments. This yielded a smaller
round of modifications, primarily language changes to avoid ambiguity, which gave us the final version
of the survey. We have made the final version of the survey available as an Internet Appendix.
We designed the survey in Qualtrics and solicited all survey respondents via e-mail. We composed
our mailing list from several sources. First, we used alumni databases from the Chicago Booth School
of Business, Harvard Business School, and the Stanford Graduate School of Business. The MBA
graduates of these schools constitute a disproportionate number of active VCs. A study by Pitchbook
identified those schools as three of the top four MBA programs supplying VCs, with more than 40%
of all VCs holding an MBA from one of the three schools.2 We identified alumni related to VC and
manually matched them to VentureSource, a database of VC transactions maintained by Dow Jones.
We ended up with the 63, 871, and 540 individuals from Chicago, Harvard, and Stanford business
schools, respectively. Second, we used data from the Kauffman Fellowship programs for their VC
alumni. After excluding the alumni of the three business schools, we were left with a sample of 176
people. Third, the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) generously gave us a list of their
individual members, yielding an additional 2,679 individuals. Finally, we manually gathered contact
information of VCs in the VentureSource database. After again excluding the people we previously
contacted, we arrived at a sample of 13,448 individuals. We believe our survey encompassed the
overwhelming majority of individuals that are active VCs in the U.S. as well as a large number of
non-U.S. VCs.
Our sample construction raises a number of issues that we attempted to address in the survey design.
One potential issue is that some of the people we emailed may not be VCs. Our first criteria for
deciding whether an individual is a venture capitalist was his or her identification as such either by
the organizations that provided us their information or by VentureSource. We emailed only people

details.

9

that we positively identified as VCs. For example, we only e-mailed Stanford Graduate School of
Business alumni who were listed as VCs by Stanford or were listed in VentureSource.
As a further filter, at the start of the survey, we asked respondents whether they worked at an
institutional VC fund, a corporate VC vehicle, or neither. Supporting the notion that our initial
screen worked well, 94% of our respondents identified as working at either a corporate VC vehicle or
an institutional VC fund. The remainder were angel investors or worked at PE funds or family offices.
For our analyses, we exclude any respondent who did not identify as working at an institutional
VC fund. While the identification is self-reported, in conjunction with other questions in the survey
that are specific to the VC industry, we are confident that our final survey respondents are active
in the VC industry. We also acknowledge that there may be a grey area that separates late-stage
growth-equity VC funds and some PE funds. We do not believe that this distinction in any way
affects our analysis.
A second potential issue is that our population of VCs is not representative of the broader industry.
In our case, there are several factors that may bias our sample toward more successful VCs. First, a
disproportionate part of our sample comes from Kauffman Fellows and the graduates of top MBA
programs. Due to our connections, we explicitly targeted Chicago, Harvard, and Stanford MBAs
and Kauffman Fellows. We received very high response rates from those groups. Given that these
are top MBA programs and the Kauffman Fellows program is extremely selective, these alumni are
likely more successful than average VCs.3 Second, we are vulnerable to self-selection bias because we
include only the VCs who respond to the survey. This is, of course, an issue with any survey of this
kind. Both of these factors likely bias our final sample toward more successful VCs. To the extent
that we want to learn about best practices in the VC industry, this bias supports our investigation.
Taking into account our relatively high response rate and our large final sample, our results reflect
the views of a sample of VCs that may be somewhat more successful than representative.
We administered the survey between November 2015 and March 2016 in several waves using the
Qualtrics website. To encourage responses, we sent the survey requests to the alumni from those
of us on the faculty of their respective schools. To encourage completion, we offered those who

Gompers, Mukharlyamov and Xuan (2016) show that VCs who are graduates from top colleges and top MBA
schools perform better.

10

completed the survey an early look at the results. The survey is fully confidential and all the reported
results are based on the aggregation of many responses to exclude the possibility of inferring any
specific respondent’s answers. However, the survey was not anonymous and we matched the survey
respondents with VentureSource and other data sources. Our final response rates are 37%, 19%,
24%, 35%, 7%, and 4%, respectively, from the Chicago, Harvard, Stanford, Kauffman, NVCA, and
VentureSource samples.
As expected, we had a large response rate from the schools and organization (Kauffman) with which
we are connected. Our response rate from the schools is substantially larger than the rate reported
in a number of other surveys of similar nature. While the response rate from VentureSource is low,
we do not know to what extent the contact info given in VentureSource is current and how many
of these investors are VCs.4 Many individuals in this sample are also outside the U.S., where our
English-language reach and familiarity recognition would be lower.
Our survey has up to 71 questions (depending on the survey path chosen) and testing showed it
took 25–35 minutes to complete. Actual time spent by respondents matched our tests: the median
time for completion was 24 minutes, with the 25th and 75th percentiles being 13 and 58 minutes.
This suggests that most survey respondents took the survey seriously and devoted reasonable effort
towards it. Although we had relatively low explicit incentives for completing the entire survey, we
enjoyed high completion rates (57–78%) from our alumni groups. Completion rates among the NVCA
and the VentureSource samples were lower (42–56%); however, those that did complete the survey
spent as much time on the survey as our other samples.

2.2

Summary statistics

In this section, we provide the summary statistics of the sample and introduce the subsamples that we
use in our analyses. We received 1,110 individual responses overall. Table 2 describes how we filter the
responses. We exclude the 225 (20%) of respondents who did not self-report they were institutional
VCs.5 These investors are corporate VCs, PE investors, or angel investors; we exclude them in order
4
Indeed, 25% of our VentureSource contact emails bounced, and among the emails that did not we received a number
of replies that they are not active VCs but either PE investors, past VCs, or other investment professionals.

Institutional VC firms are independent partnerships that manage VC funds on behalf of investors. VCs who manage
funds are traditionally called general partners (GPs) and their investors—limited partners (LPs).

11

to focus on institutional VC investors. The second part of Table 2 reports the composition of the
final sample of institutional VC respondents. We use all answers from our 885 institutional VC
respondents, with 565 (64%) of those respondents finishing the survey. Only 11 (1%) respondents in
this sample indicated they completed the survey on behalf of someone else.
In a number of cases, we received multiple responses from different individuals at the same VC firm
and so we have only 681 VC firms for our 885 respondents. For VC firms where we had more than one
respondent, we averaged the responses of the individual VCs to get a firm-level response. We were
able to match 89% of the firms to VentureSource. Overall, 76% of the top 50 VC firms completed
our survey, including all but one of the top 10 firms, when ranked by number of investments in
VentureSource. (Using other measures such as the VC firms with the most IPOs produces similar
results.) It is worth noting that this means that a large fraction of the most successful VC firms are
in our sample. This is consistent with the possibility, noted earlier, that our sample is biased towards
more successful firms. It also is worth adding that our sample includes respondents from venture
capital firms accounting for 63% of US assets under management, according to VentureSource data.
Our first questions were general questions about the VC firm’s investment focus. We asked respondents
whether their firms specialized in a specific stage of company, industry, or geography. If respondents
answered yes to any of these possibilities, they were asked follow-up questions on specific specialization
strategies. For example, participants who indicated that their funds targeted companies at specific
stages were asked a follow-up question on which stages they specialized on (seed, early, mid, late).
Firms can specialize along multiple dimensions at the same time. Among our sample of institutional
VC firms, 62% specialize in a particular stage, 61% in a particular industry, and 50% in a particular
geography. Of those specializing in a particular investment stage, 245 (36%) firms indicated that they
invest only in seed- or early-stage companies (“Early” subsample), while 96 (14%) indicated that they
invest only in mid- or late-stage companies (“Late” subsample). Given that stage of development
should play a large role in the decision-making process of VC firms, our subsequent analysis breaks
out these two subsamples and compares their survey responses.
While VC firms invest in a variety of industries, two industries stood out in the survey. 135 (20%)
VC firms specialize in what can be broadly defined as the IT industry, including Software, IT,
and Consumer Internet (“IT” subsample). 88 (13%) of VC firms specialize in healthcare (“Health”

12

subsample). To capture any important distinctions that exist between these two industries, these
subsamples include VC firms that specialize only in these industries. If we include firms that list IT
as one of their industries of investment, the fraction increases from 20% to 41%. For healthcare, the
fraction goes up from 13% to 31%. Most VC firms invested in 3 or more industries, and a full 39%
were generalists without an industry focus.
Respondents were less likely to identify a specific geographic focus. For example, only 12% of VC
firms indicated that they focus on California. The geographical expansion and globalization of the
VC industry is a relatively recent phenomenon and our results suggest that most VC firms reach a
number of geographical markets at the same time. Chen, Gompers, Kovner and Lerner (2010) show
that VCs tended to open up new offices in the late 1990s and 2000s. Bengsston and Ravid (2015)
find that California-based VCs write more entrepreneur-friendly contracts.
To explore whether geography matters, we took where the venture capitalist lived from their LinkedIn
profile. If that was not available, we used the location of VC’s firm headquarters. Out of our sample,
28% of VCs are based in California (“CA” subsample); 40% in other U.S. locations, mostly in the
Eastern U.S. (“OthUS” subsample); and 37% outside of the U.S. (“Foreign” subsample).6 These
splits allow us to compare whether the perceived differences between the U.S. East Coast and West
Coast have any foundation, as well as whether U.S. and global VC firms operate in a similar manner.
Table 3 provides descriptive statistics on the sample of institutional VC firms represented by our
survey respondents. The variable Fund Size measures the capital under management of the current
fund of each VC firm. The average fund size is $286 million while the median is $120 million (as
reported by the respondents). These are quite similar to the average of $370 million and median of
$100 million for the matched VentureSource sample. Self-reported fund sizes, therefore, are very close
to those in VentureSource. Median size is substantially smaller than average size, because several VC
firms run very large funds. It is possible that fund size influences venture capitalist investing and
decision-making. Accordingly, we divide the sample into two subsamples—VC firms with fund sizes
below (“Small” subsample) and above median (“Large” subsample).

These percentages do not add to 100% as a small number of VCs work internationally for U.S. VC firms. The
internationally-based VCs will have their responses aggregated under a separate, foreign VC firm.

13

The median VC firm in our sample was founded in 1998, invested in 73 deals over its history, and
raised its most recent fund in 2012 as a follow on to a 2008 vintage fund. The average number of
deals is considerably larger at 169, indicating that some VC firms make a disproportionate number of
investments. The median average round size is $11 million. Consistent with VC firms being relatively
small organizations, the average VC firm has 4 investing GPs; the 25th and 75th percentiles having 3
and 5 GPs respectively. The majority of the responding firms are U.S.-based and make investments
primarily in the U.S.
Our sample contains both very successful and less successful VC firms. Our median VC reports being
in the top quartile. As reported performance appears unreliable, we use VentureSource data on IPOs
to provide an objective split on performance. We take firms with at least 10 exits in the past 10 years
in VentureSource and split those firms based on whether they have more than the median IPO rate
(“High IPO” subsample) or less (“Low IPO” subsample). Table 1 provides an overview of how these
subsamples are constructed.
Table 4 reports the positions our respondents hold in their VC firms. The bulk of our respondents are
active decision makers within their firms. Most of our sample, 82%, are partners, including Managing
Partners, General Partners, and Partners. Partners are generally senior positions with influence on
all aspects of investing including investment decisions. Managing Partners are typically a firm’s most
senior partners who coordinate operations and manage the firm’s non-investment business. Managing
Directors can be either General Partners or junior Partners, while Principals and Associates typically
have more junior status. Finally, Venture Partners are typically not employees of VC firms, but either
play the role of advisers or participate in the VC firm activities on a deal by deal basis.

Results
Deal sourcing

The ability to generate a pipeline of high-quality investment opportunities or proprietary deal flow is
considered an important determinant of success in the VC industry. Prior research has emphasized the
importance of deal sourcing (and selection) in generating returns. Sørensen (2007) uses a two-sided
matching algorithm to argue that deal sourcing and selection are more important drivers of returns
(60%) than VC value-added (40%). He is not able to distinguish between sourcing and selection.
Similarly, Gompers et al. (2010) show that high performing VC firms are more likely to invest
in successful serial entrepreneurs who have higher investment success rates. Sahlman (1990) also
emphasizes the importance of having a wide funnel to find promising investments. We, therefore,
asked VCs to identify how they source their investments.
Table 5 reports that most VC deal flow comes from the VCs’ networks in some form or another. Over
30% are generated through professional networks. Another 20% are referred by other investors and
8% from a portfolio company. Almost 30% are proactively self-generated. Only 10% come inbound
from company management. These results emphasize the importance of active deal generation. Few
VC investments come from entrepreneurs who beat a path to the VC’s door without any connection.
Finally, a recent trend in the VC industry is so-called quantitative sourcing, where VCs quantitatively
analyze data from multiple sources to identify opportunities likely to have high returns, and seek out
investment positions in those firms. Few VC firms in our sample use this method.
There is some variation across stage. Later-stage investors are more likely to generate investment
opportunities themselves compared to early-stage investors. Early-stage investors are more likely to
be referred deals by portfolio companies and to invest in deals that are inbound from management. At
the same time, there is little difference between the pipeline sources of high and low IPO subsamples,
suggesting that the type of the sources is less important than sometimes claimed. It may also be

15

the case that the critical differentiating factor for the high IPO firms is the quality of their referral
network.
VCs use a multi-stage selection process to sort through investment opportunities. Most potential
deals pass through each stage of this so-called deal funnel before being funded by the firm. When a
member of the VC firm generates a potential deal, the opportunity is first considered by the individual
originator (who could be a senior partner, a junior partner, an associate, or an affiliated member
such as a venture partner). If the investment shows potential from this initial evaluation, a VC firm
member will meet the management of the potential portfolio company at least once. If the VC firm
member continues to be impressed with the potential investment, he or she will bring the company to
other members of the VC firm for the review. Potential investments will then be scrutinized and
evaluated by the other partners at the VC firm, a process that can itself take many forms. After this
approval, the other partners at the VC firm will start a more formal process of due diligence (e.g.,
calling more references, conducting industry analysis and peer comparison). If the company passes
the due diligence process, the VC firm will present a term sheet that summarizes the VC’s conditions
for a financing. Finally, if the company agrees to the term sheet, legal documents are drafted, a letter
of commitment is signed, and the deal closes.8
While the sequence and the structure of the process outlined above is fairly well known, little is
known about the relative proportion of opportunities that make it to any one particular stage of
the deal funnel. Table 6 provides a breakdown of the deal funnel process. The median firm closes
about 4 deals per year. The table shows that for each deal in which a VC firm eventually invests or
closes, the firm considers roughly 100 potential opportunities. At each subsequent stage a substantial
number of opportunities are eliminated. One in four opportunities lead to meeting the management;
one-third of those are reviewed at a partners meeting. Roughly half of those opportunities reviewed
at a partners meeting proceed onward to the due diligence stage. Conditional on reaching the due
diligence stage, startups are offered a term sheet in about a third of cases. Offering a term sheet does
not always result in a closed deal, as other VC firms can offer competing term sheets at the same
time. Similarly, legal documentation and representations/warranties may cause deals to fall apart
between agreeing to a term sheet and the deal closing. The fact that VC firms on average offer 1.7
8

Depending upon the VC market cycle, some stages of the deal funnel may not be utilized. For example, VC firms
occasionally provide “preemptive” term sheets even before formal due diligence, in an attempt to lock-up a deal.

16

term sheets for each deal that they close, a close rate of roughly 60%, suggests that a meaningful
number of opportunities that ultimately receive funding are not proprietary.
Late-stage VC firms offer 50% more term sheets per closed deal than early-stage firms, suggesting
more proprietary deal flow for early-stage deals and greater competition for late-stage deals. This
is consistent with early-stage opportunities requiring greater understanding of the technology and
development timelines as well as with late-stage opportunities having longer track records and being
easier to evaluate.
Large VC firms and more successful VC firms have more meetings with management and initiate due
diligence on more firms per closed deal than their smaller or less successful peers. This is consistent
with larger VC firms employing more junior partners in sourcing and evaluating deals.
The IT and Health subsamples also show substantial differences in deal funnel. While an IT VC
firm considers 151 deals for each investment made, a healthcare VC firm considers only 78. These
difference persist through the first part of the funnel, with IT firms meeting the management of twice
as many companies, although after that stage, the funnel narrows with both types VC firms. This is
consistent with larger fixed costs of evaluating investments in the healthcare industry. It may also
reflect the smaller universe of potential healthcare entrepreneurs given the specific domain expertise
and regulatory knowledge in the sector.

3.2

Investment selection

Our results show that VCs start with a pipeline of hundreds of potential opportunities and narrow
those down to make a very small number of investments. In this section, we examine the factors in
their deal selection process. Kaplan and Strömberg (2004) examine venture capitalist investment
memoranda that describe the investment theses and risks of their investments. They find that VCs
focus on the quality of the management team, the market or industry, the competition, the product
or technology and the business model in their investment decisions. However, investment memoranda
do not rank the importance of the different criteria.

17

Previous empirical and anecdotal evidence suggests that VCs have different views on how to select
investments. Some focus more heavily on the management team (the jockey) while other focus more
heavily on the business: the product, technology, and business model (the horse). Kaplan et al.
(2009) examine the IPO prospectuses of successful VC-backed companies and find that the horse
(product, technology, or business model) is more stable in these companies than the jockey (i.e., the
management team).
We asked the respondents to identify the factors that drive their selection decisions and then rank
them according to their importance. The top panel of Table 7 reports the percentage of respondents
who mentioned each factor as important. The bottom panel reports the percentage of respondents
who ranked each factor as the most important.
Table 7 shows that the VCs ranked the management team (or jockey) as the most important factor.
The management team was mentioned most frequently both as an important factor (by 95% of the
VC firms) and as the most important factor (by 47% of the VCs). Business (or horse) related factors
were also frequently mentioned as important with business model at 83%, product at 74%, market
at 68%, and industry at 31%. The business related factors, however, were rated as most important
by only 37% of the firms. Fit with the fund was of some importance. Roughly one-half of the VCs
mentioned it as important and 14% mentioned it as the most important. Valuation and VCs’ ability
to add value were each mentioned by roughly one-half of the VCs, but were viewed as most important
by fewer than 3% overall.
There is some interesting cross-sectional variation. The team is more likely to be the most important
factor for early-stage investors and IT investors than for late-stage and healthcare investors. Business
related factors are more likely to be most important for late-stage and healthcare investors. Indeed,
the Health subsample is the only one that did not overwhelmingly chose team as the most important
factor. Valuation is also more important, both as a factor and as the most important factor for
late-stage investors.
Comparing our results to Gompers et al. (forthcoming), late-stage funds are more similar to private
equity funds in that they see valuation and business model as highly important. Larger funds and
more successful firms care more about valuation and product and less about fit or ability to add

18

value. This valuation result is arguably consistent with Hsu (2004), who shows that high quality VC
firms are able to win deals despite submitting term sheets at a lower valuation.
Table 7 indicates that the management team is consistently the most important factor VCs consider
when they choose portfolio companies. Table 8 reports the qualities that are important in a
management team. Ability is the most mentioned factor, with more than two thirds of VCs claiming it
is important. Industry experience is the second most mentioned factor, with passion, entrepreneurial
experience, and teamwork filling out the ranking.
California VC firms are more likely to say passion is important and less likely to say experience is
important. Healthcare VCs, again, differ from other VCs in placing industry experience as by far the
most important quality and ranking passion as substantially less important.
We ask several additional questions about deal selection. Table 9 tabulates these results. VCs devote
substantial resources to conducting due diligence on (i.e., investigating) their investments. The
average deal takes 83 days to close; the average firm spends 118 hours on due diligence over that
period and the average firm calls 10 references. The deal period and time on due diligence are shorter
for early-stage, IT, and California firms; and longer for late-stage, healthcare, and non-California
firms. Late-stage firms also call more references (13 on average) than early-stage firms (8).

3.3

Valuation

Kaplan and Strömberg (2003) describe the typical terms used in VC financing and the theoretical
rationales for many of them. U.S. VC firms typically invest using convertible preferred equity, which
entitles them to cash flow rights and an ownership stake in the company. An important result of the
negotiation is the size of the ownership stake or, equivalently, the implied valuation the financing
terms create.
In the survey, we asked several questions about how VC firms approach valuation and how term
sheets are structured. We began by asking the VCs which factors are important in deciding on the
valuation they offer a company. Table 10 indicates that exit considerations are the most important
factor, with 86% of respondents identifying it as important and 46% as the most important factor.

19

Comparable company valuations rank second (with 80% rating it important and 29% most important)
and desired ownership third (with 63% rating it important and 18% most important).
The fourth factor, competitive pressure exerted by other investors was markedly less important (with
43% rating it important and only 3% most important), although the IT VC firms thought it was more
important than their peers in the healthcare VC firms. This suggests that the IT VC industry is
more competitive than the healthcare VC industry and may give the founders of IT companies better
bargaining power. This interpretation also is consistent with the steeper term sheet competition in
Table 6. Whether it is seen in the resulting payoff structure of both industries should be an important
subject for future research.
Late-stage VC firms found exit considerations to be more important, likely because it is easier to
predict by this stage of company development what shape the exit would take. Early-stage firms
cared more about desired ownership.
We also asked VCs whether they set valuations using investment amount and target ownership. The
third panel of Table 10 shows that roughly half of investors use this simple decision rule. There
is a large discrepancy, however, between early-stage and late-stage investors. Early-stage VCs are
more likely to set the valuation using investment amount and target ownership. This result is
consistent with early-stage companies having little information and high uncertainty that leads VCs
to simplify their valuation analysis. Late-stage VCs have more information and can potentially use
more sophisticated methods to arrive at the implied valuation.

3.3.1

Valuation methods

Finance theory teaches that investment decisions should be made using a discounted cash flow
(DCF) or net present value (NPV) analysis with a cost of capital based on the systematic risk of
the opportunity. Graham and Harvey (2001) find that 75% of CFOs always or almost always use
such analyses, using them as often as internal rates of return. Gompers et al. (forthcoming) find
that private equity investors rely primarily on internal rates of return and multiples to evaluate
investments. They infrequently use NPV methods. We repeated the analyses in those two papers by
asking our respondents a number of questions on the financial and valuation metrics they use.

20

First, we asked how important financial metrics such as internal rate of return (IRR), cash-on-cash
return, or NPV are in making investment decisions. The results in Table 11 are similar to those for
private equity investors. The most popular methods are cash-on-cash multiples (63% of the sample)
and IRR (42% of the sample). Only 22% of the VC investors use NPV methods. While this level
of reliance on NPV would be considered low for mature firms, the response rate does go against
anecdotal evidence that VCs rarely use NPV to evaluate investments. One possibility is that our
sample has a substantial proportion of MBA graduates who were exposed to modern finance valuation
methods in school.
At the same time, consistent with the anecdotal evidence, 9% of the VCs claim that they do not
use any financial metrics. This is particularly true for early-stage investors, 17% of whom do not
use any financial metrics. Furthermore, almost half of the VCs, particularly the early-stage, IT, and
smaller VCs, admit to often making gut investment decisions. We also asked respondents whether
they quantitatively analyze their past investment decisions and performance. This is very uncommon,
with only one out of ten VCs doing so.
Table 12 reports the required IRRs and cash-on-cash multiples for those respondents who indicated
they used them. The average required IRR is 31%, which is higher than the 20 to 25% IRR reported
by private equity investors in Gompers et al. (forthcoming). Late-stage and larger VCs require lower
IRRs of 28% to 29% while smaller and early-stage VCs have higher IRR requirements. The same
pattern holds in cash-on-cash multiples, with an average multiple of 5.5 and a median of 5 required
on average, with higher multiples for early-stage and small funds. The source of these differences is
not entirely clear. Early-stage funds may demand higher IRRs due to higher risk of failure, i.e., they
may calculate IRRs from “if successful” scenarios. Small funds potentially demand higher IRRs due
to capital constraints or the fact that they invest in, on average, earlier stage deals.
We also asked about adjustments to required IRR or cash-on-cash multiples. Table 13 shows that
64% of VC firms adjust their target IRRs or cash-on-cash multiples for risk. This is a smaller fraction
than the 85% reported by Gompers et al. (forthcoming) for private equity firms, but still the majority
of VC firms make an adjustment for risk. The Late, Large, and Health subsamples are likely to adjust
for risk, consistent with the notion that these samples use more technical methods in analysing their
investments. Roughly half of the VCs adjust for time to liquidity in making a decision. This may

21

simply reflect that longer-term investments require a larger multiple because of the greater elapsed
time at a given return. Alternatively, it may reflect that fact that VC funds have a limited lifetime
(typically ten years with three years of automatic extensions). At the same time, 23% of VCs use the
same metric for all investments, indicating that they do not make any adjustments for risk, time to
liquidity or industry conditions.
Adjusting IRRs or cash-on-cash multiples for risk is potentially consistent with the result in finance
theory that an investment’s discount rate should increase with the investment’s systematic or market
risk. However, the discount rate should not include idiosyncratic or non-market risk. Table 14 explores
this further. Only 5% of VCs discount systematic risk more. The majority (78%) either do not adjust
for risk or treat all risk the same, with an additional 14% discounting idiosyncratic risk more.
Overall, VC firms as a class appear to make decisions in a way that is inconsistent with predictions
and recommendations of finance theory. Not only do they adjust for idiosyncratic risk and neglect
market risk, 23% of them use the same metric for all investments, even though it seems likely that
different investments face different risks.

3.3.2

Forecasting

To use financial metrics such as IRR or cash-on-cash multiples, investors need to forecast the
underlying cash flows. Accordingly, we asked VCs whether they forecast company cash flows and if
so for how long. Table 15 reports that 20% of VC firms do not forecast company cash flows. This
seems surprisingly high, but matches the responses on other questions that suggest that many VCs
rely on more qualitative factors.
The prevalence of non-forecasting varies by the stage of company the firm targets. While only 7% of
late-stage funds do not forecast, fully 31% of the early-stage VCs report that they do not forecast
cash flows. Again, this is clearly not consistent with finance theory. On the other hand, this is
understandable given that early-stage funds often invest in companies that are far from generating
profit and, sometimes are not even generating revenue. For such early-stage companies, forecasting
and discounting cash flows arguably would generate very imprecise estimates of value.

22

For funds that do forecast, the median forecast period is 3 to 4 years. This is a shorter period than the
5-year forecast period used by virtually all private equity firms in Gompers et al. (forthcoming). The
median and average are greater for late-stage suggesting that as uncertainty declines, VC investors
behave more like PE investors.
We also ask about the extent to which portfolio companies meet their projections. VCs report that
fewer than 30% of the companies meet projections. Consistent with greater uncertainty, early-stage
VCs report their companies are less likely to meet projections (26%) than do late-stage VCs (33%).
This also potentially provides an explanation for the higher IRR requirements for early-stage VCs—the
higher IRR offsets greater (total) risk.

3.3.3

Unicorns

We included a set of questions regarding the valuations of so-called unicorns, companies with implied
valuations above $1 billion. Table 16 shows both whether a VC has invested in a unicorn and the
respondent’s investment opinion on whether unicorns are overvalued. Just under 40% of our sample
VCs claim to have invested in a unicorn. This suggests that a meaningful fraction of our sample has
been able to invest in high profile, successful companies. The VCs in IT and with higher IPO rates
are more likely to have done so.
Interestingly, 91% of our sample believe that unicorns are overvalued—either slightly or significantly.
There are no significant differences across our different subsamples. Perhaps more importantly, there
is no difference between VCs who invested in unicorns and VCs who did not. This lack of a difference
is particularly encouraging to us because it suggests that the VCs answered this question honestly.
One might have expected investors in unicorns to have been more favourable about unicorn valuations
than non-investors.

3.4.1

Deal structure
Contractual features

Valuation is one part of the negotiation process that takes place between new VC investors, existing
investors, and founders. Another part is the sophisticated contract terms—cash flow, control,
liquidation rights—that VCs negotiate in their investments. Kaplan and Strömberg (2003, 2004)
describe these terms and examine the role that internal risk, external risk, and execution risk play in
determining the contractual provisions seen in VC contracts.
Accordingly, we survey our VCs about the terms they use and the negotiability of those terms. Table
17 reports the average frequency with which VCs use each of several terms. The presence of each
of these terms favors the investor over the entrepreneur so a higher number suggests the investor
favorable or investor friendly provision is more common. Pro-rata rights, which give investors the
right to participate in the next round of funding, are used in 81% of investments. Participation
rights that allow VC investors to combine upside and downside protection (so that VC investors first
receive their downside protection and then share in the upside) are used on average 53% of the time.
Redemption rights give the investor the right to redeem their securities, or demand from the company
the repayment of the original amount. These rights are granted 45% of the time.
Other investor-friendly terms are less common. Cumulative dividends accumulate over time and
effectively increase the investor’s return (and sometimes ownership stake) upon eventual liquidation.
Our VC firms use this provision 27% of the time. Full-ratchet anti-dilution protection gives the
VC more shares (compared to the more standard choice of weighted-average dilution protection)
if the company raises a future round at a lower price; this investor protection is used 27% of the
time. Finally, liquidation preference gives investors a seniority position in liquidation. Typically,
investors receive a one-times (1X) liquidation preference in which an investor’s seniority extends
to their original investment. Any preference above that can be thought of as being more investor
friendly. We asked how frequently a 2-times (2X) or greater liquidation preference is used, in which
the investor receives back twice their original investment amount before common shareholders receive
anything. Such a provision is used 19% of the time.

24

There is substantial cross-sectional variation in the use of terms. The terms in the IT sector are more
founder friendly than in the healthcare sector. The IT VC firms are less likely to use participation
rights and less likely to use 2X or higher liquidation preferences. Given that the results of Table 10
suggest that the IT sector is more competitive, the founder friendliness of the terms is understandable.
Consistent with Bengtsson and Ravid (2015), California VC firms also use more founder friendly
terms. They are less likely to use participation rights, redemption rights, or cumulative dividends
than the VC firms elsewhere in the U.S. Again, this may reflect a more competitive VC industry in
CA, although it may also reflect a difference in approaches.
To understand which of the terms might vary with deal characteristics, we asked the survey respondents
to indicate the terms that they are more or less flexible with when negotiating new investments. In
addition to the terms in Table 17, we asked about option pools, vesting, control rights, and ownership.
An option pool is a set of shares set aside to compensate and incentivize employees, vesting refers to
a partial forfeiture of shares by the founders or employees who leave the company, and control rights
include features such as board seats, veto rights on important decisions, and protective provisions.
For each term, respondents rated their flexibility on that term on a scale of not at all flexible, not very
flexible, somewhat flexible, very flexible, and extremely flexible. We assigned a score to each choice,
with −100 being investor friendly (Not at all flexible) and +100 being founder friendly (Extremely
flexible). A value of 0 means that on average survey respondents were somewhat flexible about the
term.
Table 18 reports the results. Overall, the VCs are not overly flexible on their terms with most terms
scoring between not very flexible and somewhat flexible. Only one term, dividends, scores appreciably
above somewhat flexible (at +28). Consistent with previous work, this suggests that the terms are
very important to the VCs.
The least negotiable provisions for VC firms in descending order are pro-rata rights, liquidation
preference, anti-dilution protection, valuation, board control, and vesting. The provisions on which
VCs are most flexible (again, in descending order, the first being most flexible) are dividends,
redemption rights, option pool, investment amount, and participation. In Kaplan and Strömberg
(2004), liquidation preferences and board control are related to internal and external risk; anti-dilution
protection is related to only internal risk; and redemption rights are related to external risk. We

25

cautiously interpret these results as showing that that VCs are somewhat less flexible on terms that
manage internal risk.
Healthcare VC firms are substantially less flexible on many features than the IT VC firms. In addition
to participation that we already discussed, the Health subsample is less flexible on control, valuation,
ownership stake, and dividends. The board control provisions are particularly striking, because
Healthcare VC firms rank them as their least flexible term, while the IT VC firms rank control in the
middle of their concerns. This is consistent with Healthcare companies being more susceptible to
internal risks (e.g., project selection).

3.4.2

Syndication

VC firms routinely invest with other firms as part of a syndicate. Hochberg et al. (2007) suggest
a number of reasons for the prevalence of syndication, such as reputation, capital constraints of
investors, and risk sharing. Lerner (1994) argues that the ability to monitor (from industry expertise
or proximity to the company) is related to syndication.
Accordingly, we asked the VCs several questions to learn more about the syndication process. In
our sample, Table 19 indicates that syndication is common with the average VC firm syndicating an
average 65% of its investments. Early-stage and healthcare VC firms are more likely to syndicate
their deals.
Consistent with Hochberg et al. (2007) and Lerner (1994), complementary expertise, capital constraints,
and risk sharing are all important factors in syndication decisions with more than 70% of the VCs
mentioning each of them. Among these, capital constraints are the most important for 39%, followed
by complementary expertise by 33% and risk sharing by 24%. Syndication in order to participate in
future deals and, arguably, build reputation, is perceived as substantially less important, with only
29% of VC firms identifying it as important and only 3% as most important.
There is some cross-sectional variation within our sample as well. Early-stage VC firms care more
about risk sharing, possibly because of the greater uncertainty at the early-stage, and also care more
about the ability to participate in future deals. Healthcare VC firms also identify risk sharing as

26

more important factor than their counterparts in the IT sample. Not surprisingly, small VC firms
believe that capital constraints play a more prominent role than do large VC firms. They also believe
that participation in future deals is more important.
We next asked about the factors that were important in choosing a syndicate partner. Table 20
shows that expertise and past shared successes were identified as important (73% and 65%) and
most important (25% and 28%) by the most VCs. Reputation, track record and capital also were
consistently important for roughly 60% of the VCs, but they were less likely to be most important
at 16%, 16% and 9%, respectively. Expertise is relatively more important in healthcare (versus IT)
while geography and social connections are identified as less important. This suggests that in the IT
sector, clustering and network effects play a larger role, while in the healthcare sector, product or
technology rather than location is more influential.

3.5

Post-investment value-added

Previous empirical work finds evidence that VCs add value to their portfolio companies after they invest.
Hellmann and Puri (2002) show that VCs are essential to the professionalization of startups. Lerner
(1995) examines how VCs are influential in the structuring of the boards of directors. Amornsiripanitch
et al. (2016) show that VCs are critical aids in hiring outside mangers and directors. In their study of
investment memoranda, Kaplan and Strömberg (2004) find that VCs expect to add value when they
make their investment decision. In this section, we attempt to add to the previous work by asking
the VCs to describe their post-investment deal management, particularly activities in adding value to
portfolio companies.
We asked several questions about how VCs interact with their portfolio companies after investment.
Previous research as well as anecdotal evidence suggests that VCs are actively involved in managing
their portfolio companies, frequently meeting with their portfolio companies’ management and playing
an important role in critical hiring and strategic decisions.
Table 21 reports that VCs (say they) interact frequently with their portfolio companies. Over 25%
interact multiple times per week and an additional one-third interact once a week, indicting that
60% of VCs report interacting at least once per week with their portfolio companies. Fewer than

27

one-eighth report interacting once per month or less. The high level of involvement is consistent with
previous work and anecdotal evidence.
There is little variation across subsamples. Whatever their specialization, VCs are actively involved
in their portfolio companies. This lack of observed difference is arguably a surprising result. It is
not consistent with early-stage and late-stage VCs being fundamentally different in the frequency of
interactions. It seems plausible that companies at all stages of development go through a number of
critical phases (raising funding, exiting, hiring senior executives, deciding on a strategic plan) that
require the regular involvement of investors. It is also likely that VCs monitor their investment closely,
because even late-stage VC companies have a relatively high rate of failure.
Table 22 looks more deeply into VC interaction with their portfolio companies by asking what type
of value-add VCs provide. 87% of VCs are involved in strategic guidance of their portfolio companies.
This is not surprising because many VCs serve either as board members or board observers. 72% of VC
firms help their companies connect with investors in future rounds. Again, this is not surprising given
that they are investors and are presumably knowledge about the VC industry and other investors.
Perhaps more surprisingly, 69% of the VCs say they help their companies connect to customers and
65% of VC firms say they provide operational guidance. Both of these responses suggest a substantial
and more day-to-day practical involvement. Finally, the VCs say they also help in hiring—both board
members (58%) and employees (46%).
Across subsamples, connecting to investors is more important for early-stage investors. This is
consistent with more competition for late-stage deals (as suggested in Table 6). Early-stage VCs and
California VC are more likely to help with hiring employees. California VCs also are more involved in
helping companies find customers, potentially because they work in a cluster-like environment that
makes them better connected along the whole of the supply chain of their ecosystem.
We also gave respondents an opportunity to describe their activities, if they felt the offered list was
not sufficient. One out of five respondents used this opportunity. The more frequently mentioned
activities were related to liquidity events (introducing a company to acquirers or connecting with
investment banks, helping with M&A), mentoring, fund raising, product development (including help

28

with global expansion, technical advice, operating procedures) and various board service activities
(such as board governance).
Overall, the results in Table 22 suggest that VCs are not passive investors and actively add value to
their portfolio companies. The results add to and confirm the previous work by suggesting that VCs
take an active role in customer introductions and operational guidance in addition to providing help
with hiring and strategy.

3.6

Exits

Because VCs invest in private companies through funds that are usually structured as ten-year
vehicles and because VCs receive their profit share or carry only when they return capital to their
investors, the timing and type of exit is critical to VC investment success. Gompers (1996) shows that
achieving a successful IPO exits is useful for VC firms to establish a reputation and raise new capital.
Accordingly, we surveyed our VCs on their exits. Table 23 reports the statistics on exit outcomes
experienced by their portfolio companies. Overall, the average VC firm reports that 15% of its exits
are through IPOs, 53% are through M&A, and 32% are failures. These rates of successful outcomes
may seem high to some readers. It is possible, however, that some M&A events are disguised failures
in the VC industry and so statistics on M&A may not be a valid measure of success. A major concern
with any survey is that survey respondents would bias their responses by overweighting positive
outcomes and underweighting less favorable outcomes. Indeed, many of our respondents said that
their previous fund was well above the median in terms of performance. On the other hand, our
respondents gave what appear to be honest answers to the question of unicorn valuation.
To ascertain whether there is an appreciable bias, we compare the survey responses with data matched
from VentureSource. We report two different measures of exits from VentureSource, the first using
data over the past 10 years, spanning approximately respondents’ previous fund and the second
including the full sample data for the VC firm. The responses of our respondents and the data from
VentureSource exhibit a high degree of correspondence although our respondents report a slightly
higher percentage of IPOs and a lower percentage of failures, suggesting that our survey respondents
are more successful than a random sampling of VCs. Survey respondents report that on average, 15%

29

of the deals end in IPO, while the IPO rate in VentureSource data is 13%. Moreover, the subsample
results are also consistent. For example, the Health and IT subsamples report 23% and 13% of IPOs,
respectively. The matched VentureSource samples report similar values of 22% and 12%. Several VCs
explicitly said that many of their M&A are disguised failures, supporting the difficulty of interpreting
the M&A results from available datasets on VC outcomes. Overall, these results again suggest that
the VC are, on average, reporting their experience truthfully.9
Empirically, it is difficult to measure the exact returns earned by VC firms using commercially
available datasets, because doing so requires data on deal structure and eventual exits that are usually
not available. To estimate the return distribution, we asked our survey respondents to describe the
distribution of exit multiples that they experienced on their past investments. Table 24 indicates that,
on average, 9% of exits have a multiple greater than 10 and a further 12% have a multiple between
5 and 10. There are more high multiple exits than IPOs (and not all IPOs result in such high exit
multiples). On the other end of the spectrum, 24% of outcomes are reported to have lost money
in a cash-on-cash calculation. 19% had an exit multiple of between 1 and 2, likely losing money
on a present value basis. These results confirm the wide dispersion of financial outcomes for VC
investments and further supports the notion that there is a wide distribution among of outcome for
M&A transactions. Early-stage and high IPO firms report higher multiples. The IT, Large, and CA
subsamples have higher dispersion of outcomes, with more of the least and most successful outcomes.

3.6.1

Relative importance of deal sourcing, investment selection, and value-add

The previous sections have shown that VCs exert effort and expend resources on deal sourcing,
deal selection and post-investment value-add. As mentioned earlier, Sørensen (2007) estimates the
contribution of VC value-add to be 40% and that of deal sourcing and selection combined to be 60%.
In Table 25, we ask the VCs both to assess and rank the importance of deal sourcing, deal selection,
and VC value-add in contributing to value creation.
The top part of Table 25 indicates that a majority of VCs believe that all three are important for
value creation with selection and value-add being important for roughly 85% and deal flow for 65%.
9

If we use only the matched VentureSource sample, the self-reported exit outcomes are virtually the same.

30

The bottom part of Table 25 shows that deal selection emerges as the most important of the three
with 49% of VCs ranking it most important. Value-add follows with 27% and deal flow lags with 23%.
Selection is assessed as the most important factor for all of the sub-categories, and is relatively more
important for the high IPO firms. Deal flow is relatively more important for IT investors, large
investors, and less successful investors, while value-add is relatively more important for small investors,
health investors, and foreign investors.
Overall, consistent with Sørensen (2007), deal sourcing and selection combined are more important
than value-add, but all three factors are important. Different from and extending Sørensen (2007),
we distinguish between sourcing and selection, and find a great role for selection.

3.6.2

Sources of success and failure

At this point, we have reported survey results on how VCs source, select, add value to and exit
deals. For our final questions regarding investments, we asked the VCs to identify the most important
drivers of both their successful and failed investments. Tables 26 and 27 show the results for success
and failure, respectively. For both success and failure, the team is by far the most important factor.
Recalling our discussion of horse vs. jockey, the jockey is very important in the minds of VCs. 96%
(92%) of VC firms identified team as an important factor and 56% (55%) identified team as the
most important factor for success (failure). Team was the most important for all subsamples, but
particularly important for early-stage and IT VCs.
Not one of the business-related factors—business model, technology, market and industry—was rated
most important by more than 10% of the VCs for success or failure. Cumulatively, the four were
rated most important by 25% for success and 31% for failure. The business-related factors were more
important for later-stage and, particularly, for healthcare VCs.
Timing and luck also mattered with the two being rated as the most important factor by 18% of the
VCs for success and 12% for failure. The California VCs viewed themselves as being more dependent
on luck than the VCs elsewhere. Interestingly, very few of the VCs ranked the board of directors
or their own contribution as the most important factor for either success or failure. We view this,

31

again, as encouraging that the VCs answered truthfully. One might have expected self-serving or
even simply overconfident VCs to rank their own contributions more highly.
The emphasis on team as critical for success is consistent with the VCs emphasis on team in selection.
The lack of emphasis on own contribution appears less consistent with the finding in Table 25 that
27% of the VCs view value-add as the most important source of value creation. One way to reconcile
these is that some value-add takes the form of choosing or putting in the right management team as
well as improving the business model or picking the right time to invest.
In comparing success and failure, there are no significant differences in the most important factors. The
VCs do mention several factors more often as having importance in success rather than failure—luck
(26%), timing (18%), own contribution (17%) and technology (14%).

3.7

Internal organization of VC firms

Relatively little is known about the internal organization of VC firms. Because VCs are often secretive
about the internal workings of their firms, we took this opportunity to ask how their firms are
organized and structured.
Table 28 confirms the perception that institutional VC firms are small organizations. The average
VC firm in our survey employs 14 people, 5 of whom are senior partners in decision-making positions.
VC firms have relatively few junior deal-making personnel (about one for each two partners) and an
average of 1.3 venture partners. Others working at VC firms would include entrepreneurs in residence,
analysts (likely at larger firms), back-end office personnel, and logistics personnel. Note that, as Table
4 shows, 82% of our survey respondents are senior partners, so our survey oversamples VCs in senior
decision-making positions.
Early-stage VC firms are smaller and, in particular, have fewer junior deal-making personnel than
late-stage VC firms. Late-stage firms deal with companies that require more due diligence and have
more information available for analysis; the presence of associates and similar personnel makes sense.
Healthcare VC firms are more likely to have venture partners, potentially because healthcare and
biotech industry investments require specialized skills that non-full time venture partners (such as

32

medical school faculty) can provide. Other than for these two subsamples, the composition of VC
firms is relatively uniform—although larger and more successful funds are, of course, larger.
Table 29 considers the extent to which VCs specialize. In 60% of the funds, partners specialize in
different tasks; this degree of specialization is relatively uniform across subsamples. If respondents
answered that partners in their VC firm specialized in different tasks, we asked what the respondents
specialized in. Respondents could choose more than one option. Table 29 shows that for those firms
with specialized partners, 44% of respondents are generalists, 52% of respondents are responsible
for fund raising, and 55% and 53% of them are also responsible for deal making and deal sourcing,
respectively. Interestingly, almost a third of respondents also reported that they specialized in helping
start-ups with networking activities. IT VC firms are much more likely to have partners that specialize
in fund raising. Partners of large VC firms are less likely to specialize in sourcing deals, making deals,
or networking.
We also asked the survey respondents to describe the structure of their normal work-week.10 In Table
30, respondents report working an average of 55 hours per week. VCs spend the single largest amount
of time working with their portfolio companies, 18 hours a week. This may not be surprising given
that the typical respondent holds 5 board seats. Healthcare VCs spend somewhat more time helping
their companies than do IT VCs even though they serve on slightly fewer boards. Overall, the amount
of time and involvement in portfolio companies is consistent with their reporting that they add value
and help their companies.
Consistent with the importance of sourcing and selecting potential deals, sourcing is the second most
important activity, at 15 hours per week. Networking is the fourth most important at 7 hours per
week. It seems likely that networking is useful both for deal sourcing and for adding value to portfolio
companies (through hiring and referring customers). VCs, then spend the bulk of their time on
sourcing and value-adding activities. In addition, VCs spend about 8 hours per week on managing
their firms and about 3 hours each week managing LP relationships and fundraising.
The next set of questions address the compensation and investment practices in the VC industry.
In the VC industry, attribution of success is easier to accomplish, because in most cases a specific
partner is responsible for each portfolio company. Alternatively, firms may choose to compensate
10

Hoyt., Gouw and Strebulaev (2012) and Rust (2003) present some earlier evidence on VCs’ time use.

33

partners on firm success to encourage cooperation among partners and to remove incentive to do
suboptimal deals in order to get credit for them. We therefore were interested in whether partners
of VC firms are compensated depending on individual investments. Table 31 reports that 74% of
VC firms compensate their partners based on individual success. Interestingly, more successful and
larger VC firms are less likely to allocate compensation based on success. Table 31 also reports that
in 44% of VC firms partners receive an equal share of the carry, particularly partners in early-stage
funds. Similarly, in 49% of the firms, partners invest an equal share of fund capital. These results
are arguably consistent with firms balancing the need for cooperation against the need to reward
individual success.
Overall, VC firms appear to approach compensating their partners in different ways. This has not
been explored in detail in academic research. Agency theories suggest that compensation structures
should have a substantial impact on effort provision and eventual outcomes. Chung et al. (2012) show
that explicit pay for performance incentives exist in VC and PE, but there are also powerful implicit
incentives that come with the need to raise additional capital in the future. Our results suggest that
studying the relationship between compensation of VCs, their contracts with their investors (LPs),
and outcomes would be an interesting avenue for further research.
We conclude this section by asking reporting how funds make initial investment decisions.11 Table 32
reports that roughly half the funds—particularly smaller funds, healthcare funds and non-California
funds—require a unanimous vote of the partners. An additional 7% of funds require a unanimous
vote less one. Roughly 20% of the funds require consensus with some partners having veto power.
Finally, 15% of the funds require a majority vote. Understanding whether these decision rules affect
investment and partnership success is also an interesting avenue for future research.

3.8

Relationships with limited partners

We conclude our survey by asking a set of questions concerning the interactions VCs have with their
limited partner investors similar to the questions in Gompers et al. (forthcoming). Table 33 indicates
that the VCs believe that cash-on-cash multiples and net IRR are important benchmark metrics
11

Not reported, most firms use the same decision process for subsequent financing rounds.

34

for most LPs, at 84% and 81%, respectively. These benchmarks are considered the most important
benchmarks by, respectively, 52% and 32% of the VCs. While performance relative to VC funds (for
60%) and relative to the S&P 500 (for 23%) are presumed to be important, they are considered most
important by fewer than 10% of the sample VCs. These results are present for all of the subsamples.
Accordingly, we conclude that the VCs strongly believe that LPs are primarily motivated by absolute
rather than relative performance. This finding is similar to the result in Gompers et al. (forthcoming)
for private equity investors, but inconsistent with finance theory where LPs should allocate their
money to funds according to their relative performance expectations. It is also inconsistent with the
common practices in the mutual fund industry, in which relative performance is paramount.
Table 34 shows the net IRR and cash-on-cash multiple marketed by VC firms to their LPs. The mean
net IRR is consistently about 24%, with a median of 20% for all subsamples. This IRR is similar to
the IRR private equity investors market to their LPs in Gompers et al. (forthcoming). Interestingly,
this is not consistent with VC investments being riskier than private equity investments. At the same
time, VC firms also market on average a 3.5 cash-on-cash multiple to their LPs, with early-stage VCs
marketing more at 3.8 and late-stage VCs marketing less at 2.8. While these multiples are slightly
higher than those for the private equity investors, the difference from private equity investments is
likely explained by the longer duration of VC investments.
Finally, Table 34 asks VCs about their expectations for future performance. The vast majority (93%)
of VCs expect to beat the public markets; 71% of VCs are similarly optimistic about the VC industry
as a whole. While this may seem to be unreasonably optimistic, Harris et al. (2016) find that the
average VC fund has performed at least as well as the S&P 500 for most vintages since 2004.

4

Conclusion

In this paper, we seek to better understand what VCs do and, potentially, why they have been
successful. We survey 885 institutional VCs at 681 firms to learn how they make decisions across eight
areas: deal sourcing; investment selection; valuation; deal structure; post-investment value-added;
exits; internal VC firm issues; and external VC firm issues.

35

The paper makes a contribution in two broad areas. First, our results add to the literature on
the nature of and relative important of deal sourcing, deal selection, and value-added. VCs devote
substantial resources to all three. While deal sourcing, deal selection, and post-investment value-added
all contribute to value creation, deal selection emerges as the most important of the three for the
sample VCs with roughly one-half of the VCs ranking it as such.
Furthermore, a recurring theme in the survey—particularly in deal selection and in understanding
ultimate deal outcomes—is the pre-eminence of team in the mind of the VCs. In selecting investments,
the VCs consider the management team as more important than business related characteristics
such as product and technology. They also view the team as more important than the business to
the ultimate success or failure of their investments. The survey, therefore, finds that VCs, on the
whole, favor the jockey view of VC investing over the horse view. This result is consistent with the
results in Bernstein, Korteweg and Laws (2015). A potential future use of this data set is to see if
cross-sectional variation in that view predicts future VC performance.
Second, we find little evidence that VCs use the net present value or discounted cash flow techniques
taught at business schools and recommended by academic finance. This contrasts with the results in
Graham and Harvey (2001) for CFOs, but is more similar to the results for private equity investors in
Gompers et al. (forthcoming). Like the private equity investors, the VCs rely on multiples of invested
capital and internal rates of return. Unlike the CFOs and private equity investors, a meaningful
minority of VCs do not forecast cash flows at all.

This table lists the correlation between indicator variables for subsample membership. In VS refers to
VC firms in Dow Jones VentureSource. Correlations are taken only over the portion of the variables
that are defined for both (IE: correlations involving VentureSource are taken only over the portion of
the sample that is in VS, correlations over deciles are taken only for VCs that answer that question.)
