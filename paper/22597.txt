Executive Lawyers: Gatekeepers or Strategic Officers?
Adair Morse, Wei Wang, and Serena Wu
NBER Working Paper No. 22597
September 2016
JEL No. G32,G34,J33,K22,M52
ABSTRACT
Lawyers now serve as executives in 44% of corporations. Although endowed with gatekeeping
responsibilities, executive lawyers face increasing pressure to use time on strategic efforts. In a
lawyer fixed effects model, we quantify that lawyers are half as important as CEOs in explaining
variances in compliance, monitoring, and business development. In a difference-in-differences
model, we find that hiring lawyers into executive positions associates with 50% reduction in
compliance breaches and 32% reduction in monitoring breaches. We then ask whether firms’
optimal contracting of lawyers into strategic activities implies less lawyer gatekeeping effort.
Using a design comparing executive lawyers hired from law firms to lawyers poached from
corporations, we find that lawyers hired with high compensation delta (indicative of the
importance of strategic goals in compensation contracts) do less monitoring, preventing 25%
fewer breaches than are typically mitigated by having an executive gatekeeper. Reassuringly,
lawyers do not compromise compliance.

I. Introduction
The general counsel (or chief legal officer) is arguably the most important internal
governance actor in the firm. This top internal lawyer now sits among the top five (in pay rank)
executives in over 44% of U.S. public corporations. Conditional on being in the inner suite,
executive lawyers earn 35% as much compensation as CEOs. What makes these executive
lawyers unique in firm leadership is their dual role as strategic officers and gatekeeping agents.
Our goals are to quantify the importance of executive lawyers on these dimensions and then to
explore whether the call to add strategic input into business development affects executive
lawyers’ gatekeeping effectiveness.
The legal literature describes the strategic and gatekeeping roles of executive lawyers
(Demott, 2005; Duggin, 2007; Heineman, 2012; Sorkin, 2012). This literature makes a
distinction between two aspects of gatekeeping: SEC financial compliance (specifically,
gatekeeping tasks that require a lawyer to sign off) and monitoring. For our purposes, this is a
helpful distinction for a number of reasons. First, our agenda builds on an important accounting
literature documenting the SEC financial compliance (hereafter, compliance) role of lawyers.

(2012), Choudhary, Schloetzer, and Sturgess (2013), Hopkins, Maydew, and Venkatachalam
(2015), and Goh, Lee and Ng (2015) collectively study the effect of the lawyer on the likelihood
of compliance breaches to accounting and insider trading regulations. Second, the signing-off
function sets apart compliance because the lawyers faces personal exposure to liability, which
surely affects behavior. In the surveys of Deloitte (2011) and KPMG (2012), roughly two-thirds
of general counsels cite maintaining compliance as their greatest concern. Monitoring covers a
large breadth of activities that lawyers guard for potential breach of law or contract, including
antitrust, disclosure, affiliated transactions, and contract infringements. 3 Although these potential
legal exposures are important, the general counsel has much more flexibility in choosing how to
use her time to monitor and mitigate risks across this broader set of legal exposures. By contrast,
compliance is a mandatory function. Third, monitoring warrants a stand-alone examination,
given the increasing importance of internal governance for the firm, following hostile takeovers
of the 1980s, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) in the early 2000s, the Dodd-Frank legislation
subsequent to the financial crisis starting in 2008, and most recently, shareholder activism.
In their third role, that of strategic officers, executive lawyers offer their legal expertise as
an input into business development and strategic risk management (Sorkin, 2012). As
motivation, imagine being a CEO or director of a company such as Tesla, Google or Ford. Surely
one would want legal expertise in the strategic team to consider consumer liability as these firms
consider capital expenditure and R&D investments in the self-driving car market. Russell
Reynolds Associates (2013) analyzed their database of 3,000 assessments of corporate
executives and found that “contrary to conventional wisdom, the legal executives go well beyond
spotting legal issues to helping the business actually take risks and find creative solutions.”
3

We build off the important work of Kwak et al. (2012), who provide evidence for monitoring by executive lawyers
by including the appointment of a new general counsel as a factor in predicting litigation risk.

2

With these roles in mind, we conduct two sets of empirical analyses. First, we gauge the
importance of executive lawyers in these multiple tasks, providing empirical support for the legal
literature on the role of corporate lawyers (e.g., Nelson and Nielsen, 2000; Coffee, 2003;
DeMott, 2005; Heineman, 2012; Sorkin, 2012). We begin with the individual fixed effects
model of Bertrand and Schoar (2003), which uses movement of executives across firms to
estimate how much variation in outcomes of firms is due to individual managers. The premise of
this methodology, originally applied to CEOs, is that if individual lawyers explain some of the
variations of an outcome over and above firm fixed effects, then one can infer that individual
differences across lawyers are relevant to the firm’s success, and thus the position of general
counsel is important to the firm.
To implement the individual fixed effects method, we measure compliance failures with
Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases (AAERs) and SEC allegations of insider
trading. We measure monitoring failures with securities fraud, securities lawsuits purged of
AAERs, and general lawsuits, and we measure business development with capital expenditure
intensity, R&D, business segments, and filing of patents. Across U.S. public corporations, we
find that lawyer fixed effects increase adjusted r-squared by 0.045 for compliance, 0.072 for
monitoring, and 0.018 for business development, over and above firm and year fixed effects and
after controlling for the firm-specific time trend. This average r-squared increment explained by
lawyers is about half as large as the r-squared increment explained by CEO fixed effects, and
thus very material.
The individual fixed effects methodology has a limitation in generalizability in that
identification comes from the selection of individuals that move. Thus, we implement a second
methodology, running propensity-score-matched, difference-in-differences tests around the

3

hiring of an executive lawyer into the firm. We find that firms hiring executive lawyers exhibit a
50% reduction of compliance failures and a 32% reduction of monitoring failures relative to their
propensity score matched firms that do not hire executive lawyers. We argue that the bias on
these results is likely to be conservative since, all else equal on observables, firms expecting
future governance strains are likely to select into hiring gatekeepers.
The two designs complement each other in mitigating other bias concerns. On one hand,
the lawyer fixed effects analysis may err on estimating only within the set of executive lawyers
who move from one corporation to another, but it is free from the biases related to the decision to
hire. On the other hand, the propensity score matched difference-in-differences analysis may err
on not being able to control for all unobservables in the decision to hire, but this analysis is free
from the selection bias by including all potential outside hires (not just movers among public
corporations). We argue that taken together, consistency in the estimates across methods
suggests robust evidence of the importance of lawyers in gatekeeping and business development.
Our second agenda is to ask whether executive lawyers trade off some of this gatekeeping
when they have incentive contracts designed to reward business development effort. We are not
saying that effort toward business development is suboptimal from a firm’s perspective, but
rather that the title of general counsel may become window dressing for society looking for full
gatekeeping assurances. The theoretic intuition behind our multi-task story is the following
setup. Imagine an executive lawyer is paid with salary and equity incentives, has limited time,
and faces the possibility of a career-ending governance breach. A governance breach also has
dire consequences to firm value, but otherwise, gatekeeping creates no firm value. Motivated by
the accounting compliance literature, we assume that the probability of a governance breach
grows convexly large as gatekeeping time decreases, but is relatively insensitive to gatekeeping

4

time once the lawyer is already a somewhat diligent gatekeeper. By contrast, when executive
lawyers spend time in business development, the effort always generates firm value. Thus, equity
incentives will tilt executive lawyers toward business development in most settings. Firms
heterogeneously choose optimal amounts of equity incentives to achieve their optimal mixture of
gatekeeping time and business development time. This intuition aligns with our understanding of
firm processes. However, we need not assume this optimal contracting intuition. An alternative
interpretation is that a lawyer may be distorted away from optimal gatekeeping with equity
incentives that the firm is forced to offer in the labor market for lawyer officers. Either story fits
with our empirical design, but we use the optimal contracting terminology.
Our identification exploits a comparison of two sets of corporations hiring executive
lawyers. The first set poaches existing corporate lawyers from other companies (treated), and the
second set hires executive lawyers from law firms (control). Our key assumption is that equity
incentives are initially less likely to divert newly-hired law firm lawyers away from gatekeeping,
compared to their corporate hired peers. The intuition is that law firm lawyers (i) exhibit loyalty
to their professional association (Goode, 1957; Hall, 1968; Wallace, 1995), (ii) must go through
a learning curve to understand the business development strategy of the firm, (iii) must change
their habit as a lawyer and learn to be more comfortable with risk, a contrast to their training to
practice risk-aversion (Dubey and Kripalani, 2013), and (iv) must be willing to step away from
their stock of reputational capital.
We use this assumption in collapsed, double and triple differenced designs that allow us
to assert a plausible casual identification of the effects of equity incentives on gatekeeping. Both
the treated and the control are firms hiring executive lawyers; we therefore avoid the endogeneity
of whether or not an executive lawyer is hired. The source of hiring, however, is endogenous.

5

We use propensity score matching within year-industry buckets to level treated and control firms
on observable predictors of past and future needs for compliance, monitoring and business
development
A residual identification concern is that the level of equity incentives is correlated with
our outcomes in a way systematic to hiring source. Contract theory predicts that firms may vary
in the level and sensitivity of optimal incentives for a host of reasons. The choice of corporate
versus law firm hires may be spuriously correlated with the optimal contracting of incentives due
to the nature of the firm. Thus, we further implement a triple differencing, differencing around
CEO equity incentives. Any residual effect identified should result through the mechanism of the
lawyer. The interpretation could either be that firms use equity incentives to allocate executive
lawyers’ time among tasks (an optimal contracting equilibrium) or that equity incentives distort
lawyers’ allocation of time among tasks. We do not distinguish between these interpretations.
We find that higher equity incentives imply materially lower monitoring performance.
Corporations providing executive lawyers with one standard deviation higher equity incentives
have 1.3 percentage points higher likelihood of securities fraud. We interpret the magnitude
relative to the benefit of having an executive lawyer gatekeeper: when firms strongly contract
executive lawyers to be strategic officers, lawyers do less monitoring, preventing 25% fewer
breaches than are typically mitigated by having an executive gatekeeper.
On the flip side of the tradeoff of executive lawyers’ time, we find some, but weak,
evidence that equity incentives induce executive lawyers to exert more effort on business
development such as capital expenditure, R&D spending, and the filing of a patent. We interpret
this evidence with caution. We find no support for equity incentives affecting compliance,

6

consistent with the literature we cite herein on the dire consequences of compliance infractions
for corporate lawyers.
Our study contributes to the new internal governance literature of Acharya, Myers, and
Rajan, (2011), Kim and Lu (2012), and Khanna, Kim and Lu (2015). Arguably, the largest
internal governance actor or gatekeeper is the general counsel; this important facet of internal
governance warrants a big-picture study that looks at its overall effectiveness as well as its
interaction with equity incentives. A recent legal literature (Duggin, 2006; Rostain, 2008;
Demott, 2012) outlines the compliance and monitoring roles of general counsel. We build on the
legal description of lawyer’s jobs in corporations and test whether the actions of general counsels
are effective. We contribute to a small but growing body of empirical studies on in-house
lawyers (Jagolinzer, et al, 2011; Kwak, et al., 2012; Hopkins, et al, 2015; Goh, et al., 2015),
which focus on the compliance role of the lawyers, by adding evidence on the monitoring role
and strategic development role with a focus on the trade-off between the two. 4
Our study also adds executive lawyers to the literature on the importance of
characteristics of individuals inside the executive suite (e.g., Bertrand and Schoar, 2003;
Malmendier and Tate, 2009; Custodio and Metzer, 2014). We show that individual lawyers
matter. Concurrently, Krishnan and Masulis (2013) and Karsten, Malmendier and Sautner (2014)
take up this question for external lawyers, asking whether lawyer quality affects acquisition
outcomes.

Our study is also related to Litov, Sepe, and Whitehead (2014), who study the governance effect of lawyers in the
board of directors.

7

Maintaining compliance in financial filings on a daily basis is the compulsory role of
executive lawyers (Lipson, Engel, and Crespo, 2012). Compliance breaches are the greatest legal
risk in the view of most executive lawyers; the top cited concerns include SEC fraud
investigations, insider trading, and financial misrepresentation (Deloitte, 2011; KPMG, 2012).
This is not surprising given the steep reputation costs to infractions of compliance. Desai, Hogan,
and Wilkins (2006) find that 60 percent of earnings restating firms experience a turnover of at
least one top manager within 24 months of the restatement compared to 35 percent among
matched firms. Karpoff, Lee, and Martin (2008) track individuals that the SEC and DOJ identify
as responsible parties for enforcement actions concerning financial misrepresentation. They find
that 93% of these individuals lose their jobs by the end of the regulatory enforcement period.
Most are explicitly fired. Moreover, if managers are alleged to be responsible directly for the
misconduct, they not only lose their jobs and bear substantial financial losses but also can face
criminal charges and even jail sentences. On the flip side, recent papers in the accounting
literature (Jagolinzer, et al., 2011; Kwak, et al., 2012) find that lawyer prestige associates with
more favorable compliance outcomes in insider trading and corporate earnings disclosure,
suggesting, importantly, that compliance reputation is an upward career ladder for corporate
lawyers.

II.b. Internal governance monitor
Beyond compliance, Demott (2005) describes general counsels’ day-to-day duties as
involving and bearing responsibility for all legal exposure affecting the corporation including
such matters as customs and trade issues, and intellectual property infractions (Dubey and
Kripalani, 2013). General counsels are often responsible for determining the appropriate level of

8

legal risks to be undertaken by their companies (Rostain, 2008), and have an ongoing role to
assess and control legal risks and assist corporations in a proactive manner to detect actions that
could lead to corporate liability (Lipson et al. 2012). An executive lawyer views herself as “a
guardian of the corporation’s integrity and reputation” (Heineman 2007), perhaps because
historically the SEC has laid governance breach liability on the position of the general counsel.
The SOX Section 307 formalized these monitoring responsibilities by adopting rules whereby
corporate lawyers are not just liable for compliance breaches, but are exposed as the office
responsible for reporting evidence of material violation of securities laws or breaches of
fiduciary duty “up-the-ladder” inside the firm. 5 In addition, SOX endowed the SEC with the
necessary power to discipline corporate lawyers who are deemed to lack integrity or who have
engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct.

II.c. Strategic officer
“A General Counsel needs to be a business person first and a lawyer
second—not a lawyer that understands the business, but a business person
that happens to be a lawyer”
- Marla Persky, General Counsel, Boehringher Ingelheim Corporation 6
A lessor understood role of an executive lawyer is as a strategic officer, adding planning
and risk management input into expansion, innovation, and business development. The role of
the executive lawyer has changed dramatically in a world with increasing importance of
intangible assets and the information economy. Bagley (2008) points out that firms characterize
their executive lawyers more as entrepreneurs than policing lawyers. Executive lawyers are
engaged in business development through the work done by the legal department’s intellectual

property teams (Dubey and Kripalani, 2013), from the earliest phases of business development
(Demott, 2005) and throughout the planning and implementation process of investment (Horner,
2007). This view is echoed in practitioner surveys; executive lawyers that receive the best
performance ratings are 11% more willing to take risks than the average executive lawyers, and
they are as likely to take risks as any other executive (Russell Reynolds Associates, 2013).

III.

Data 7

III.a. Executive lawyers and compensation
To identify the general counsel as a corporate officer, sometimes called chief legal
officer, we look for individuals holding the requisite titles by manually reading executive titles
from 10-K filings (items 4b and 10) or proxy statements for all firm years in ExecuComp, which
covers firms in the S&P large, mid and small cap indices. Over our sample period 1995-2012,
this includes 32,372 firm-year observations for more than 3,000 unique firms. We look for three
key words: “Counsel,” “Legal,” and “Law” or abbreviations or variants. Then we read each
signatory on the filings, as each company should have a lawyer that carries the responsibility of
the legal signatory to the SEC. If such person is not listed as one of the executive officers, and
the name signing the legal certification does not have a general counsel or chief legal officer
designation, it is likely that the lawyer is not an important corporate officer in the firm. We
further look to ExecuComp titles for the same legal recognition, just in case the legal counsel
also holds another title which she uses to sign the SEC documents. 8 In our sample, 70 percent of
firms on average have a general counsel as a corporate officer, relatively stable over time. 9

7

Appendix Table 1 summarizes all of the variables listed in this section.
ExecuComp often records multiple titles. One issue with Execucomp is in its use of abbreviations of an executive
title. For example, the title of a general counsel could be spelled as “gen cou,” “gncns,” “gen cns,” etc. We add all

8

10

In the main tests, we impose an additional attribute to designate general counsel in the
inner executive office as executive lawyer (ExecLawyer). We apply a monetary proxy for the
importance of the general counsel in the firm; individuals must be among the top paid officers in
a company in ExecuComp. We force stringency that this proxy is not transitory in requiring that
the officer remain in the top paid executives for three years.
Our empirical design for examining optimal contracting of equity incentives relies on the
employment history of these ExecLawyers. We look up the full career path of work experience
from law school graduation to prior to becoming ExecLawyer of a firm by hand collecting
ExecLawyer’s bios from corporate filings and online sources such as LinkedIn and law firm
websites. We are able to identify the last work experience before becoming ExecLawyer for
2,446 of the total 2,630 ExecLawyers in our sample.
We use compensation data from ExecuComp for the ExecLawyer and CEO. We use
TDC1 – total compensation – from ExecuComp to measure executives’ total pay. 10 We follow
Core and Guay (1999) to estimate the sensitivity of the value of the ExecLawyer’s accumulated
equity-based compensation (including both stocks and options) to a one-percent change in the
stock price, which is referred to as “delta”. 11

versions of these words we can find. Further, the initial search of the three key words resulted in many executives
who are not general counsels (e.g. “Special Counsel”, “Former Counsel”). We verify whether the executive officer
identified is in fact a general counsel of the firm through further reading their full executive titles.
9
Our fixed effects analysis is based on this complete set of generate counsels as corporate officers, and thereby
identifying lawyer fixed effects using all movers within our sample.
10
TDC1 is comprised of salary, bonus, other annual cash compensation, restricted stock award, LTIP, value of
option grants, and all other compensation for pre-2006 reporting format and it is comprised of salary, bonus, nonequity incentive plan compensation, grant-date fair value of option wards, grant-date fair value of stock awards,
deferred compensation earnings, and other compensation for post-2006 reporting format.
11
In order to calculate delta, we require information on the number of shares and both the number and value of
unexercised options held by the ExecLawyer. We find that ExecuComp often does not report the actual share
ownership for non-CEO executives. In such cases, we assume the delta of stock holdings to be zero. Nevertheless,
for robustness purpose, we perform additional multivariate tests by using the sub-sample after dropping delta that
carries missing/zero values.

11

III.b. Compliance failures
We measure the failures of compliance in two dimensions, both requiring the signature of
the general counsel on forms – Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases (AAERs) and
insider trading. AAERs are issued at the conclusion of an SEC investigation against a company,
an auditor, or an officer for alleged accounting and/or auditing misconduct. We obtain AAERs
data from the Center for Financial Reporting and Management Center at Berkeley Haas. We
code the variable AAER to capture when the alleged accounting misconduct was taking place
(known ex post) rather than when the enforcement action is launched. We exclude AAERs that
are not related to misstatement (e.g., for reasons such as bribery and disclosure). Because it takes
approximately a year and a half for frauds to emerge (Dyck, Morse, and Zingales, 2010) and
another span of a year or two for the SEC to complete an investigation, we truncate analysis to
2009 when studying AAERs given that our sample ends in 2012.
Similarly, we measure insider trading using alleged cases. We manually collect alleged
insider trading cases from SEC litigation releases and match them with our sample firms. 12 Thus
the two compliance failure measures are both violation based, capturing the actual failure rather
than the likelihood of compliance breaches as seen in prior studies on corporate lawyers (e.g.
earnings management measures, insider trading profit measures, etc.).

12

The
SEC
litigation
releases
are
publicly
available
on
the
SEC
website:
https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases.shtml. These releases are summaries issued by the SEC that describe civil
lawsuits brought by the Commission in federal court. We read litigation releases to uncover investigations involving
insider trading as the reason for the suits. If a corporate executive is alleged to have traded his/her own company’s
stock based on insider information or have tipped such information for others to trade, then we code that firm year to
be an insider trading year. A drawback is that the releases often do not record the exact dates when insider trading
took place. We remove these cases.

12

III.c. Monitoring failures
We measure monitoring failures with general litigation and lawsuits. First, we use the
class period (the period in which an alleged fraud was taking place) of securities class action
lawsuits. Securities fraud involves more general misconduct than financial misrepresentation,
with over 40% of securities fraud not related to misrepresentations in reporting but instead
related to other infractions such as omissions in communication, self-dealing or other illegal
activities which hurt shareholders (Dyck, Morse and Zingales, 2010; 2014). 13 Data for these
lawsuits come from the Stanford Law School Securities Class Action Clearinghouse. We cleanse
the securities class actions database of dismissed and unresolved cases. 14 Second, for robustness
we purge the securities fraud measure of those firm-years when an AAER infringement is
occurring. The third lawsuit measure covers breaches of any law, including but not restricted to
securities law. We collect general lawsuits data from Audit Analytics and purge suits that lead to
AAERs and those with zero settlement. 15 Examples of general lawsuits include suits arising from
trademark or patent disputes, product liability, personal injury, labor disputes, commercial
contracts, etc.

13

See Karpoff, Koester, Lee, and Martin (2013) for a comparison of fraud data.
To construct a securities fraud variable, we collect the class action lawsuits filed during 1995-2012 from the
Stanford Law School Securities Class Action Clearing House and merge them to Compustat. The Stanford Law
School Securities Class Action Clearing house database has been employed by a number of prior studies (e.g.,
Lowry and Shu, 2002; Field, Lowry, and Shu, 2005; Dyck, Morse, and Zingales, 2010; and Hanley and Hoberg,
2012). These securities frauds are alleged rather than proven, in that few cases ever get resolved in trail, but rather
settle out of court, because D&O insurance does not cover the executives with court convictions. There are
altogether 1,187 lawsuits filed against public firms during this period, with 582 cases that were dismissed by the
court and 78 that we remove for being unresolved.
15
There are altogether 6,929 lawsuits with 5,056 suits with zero settlement during our sample period.
14

13

III.d. Business development measures and other company outcomes
In choosing measures of business development, we focus on organic growth because
corporations almost always hire external transaction lawyers for one-time events such as M&A
or spinoffs (Krishnan and Masulis, 2013). The idea of our business development variables is not
that lawyer is sitting with the scientists and engineers doing the innovation, but that the lawyer is
asked to do an assessment of liability exposure (e.g., for consumer liability exposure in selfdriving cars or patent liability in technology market strategies) prior to an R&D or capital
expenditure campaign. Our measures of business development thus will be somewhat noisy, but
should capture on average these mechanisms, especially if contracts are optimally designed to
induce lawyer effort into these realms.
The first measure is the ratio of capital expenditure to fixed assets at the beginning of the
fiscal year, capturing investment intensity in tangible assets (Eisdorfer, 2008). The second
measure is R&D expenses scaled by assets as a measure of investment intensity in intangible
assets. The third measure is the number of business segments, capturing expansion in the line of
business. All of these measures are from Compustat data. A final measure is whether the firm is
filing patents or not, in the pre-2006 NBER patent database. 16
Our analysis also considers three typical measures of corporate governance, not related to
lawyer activity, to consider the mechanism of our results. We use institutional ownership from
Thomson Reuters Ownership Database (13Fs) to measure the strength of external shareholder
monitoring. To strengthen the board, the shareholders may bring in more independent board
16

We were kindly provided the merged NBER patent data with Compustat by Jin Wang. Admittedly, patents are a
bit problematic as a measure of business development. First is the problem of the [heterogeneous] time lag between
innovation and the filing of a patent. Second is the huge skew in patent data, which is observed even beyond taking
logarithms; we focus on the dichotomous variable “whether the firm is filing a patent” to avoid this concern. Third
and probably most substantially, is the finding by Moser (2013) and others that firms prefer secrecy over patenting
for innovation. Patenting in her historical accounts is more about diffusion.

14

members. We gather these data from Riskmetrics. We also obtain the G-index of Gompers, Ishii
and Metrick (2003) from Riskmetrics to measure shareholder rights. A higher value of G-index
indicates weaker shareholder monitoring.

IV.

The Importance of Lawyers

IV.a. Importance of lawyers: Statistics
Table 1 profiles General Counsel and ExecLawyers based on the ExecuComp sample of
32,372 firm-year observations and tabulated by fiscal years. The second and third columns
respectively report the percentage of firms having a General Counsel as a corporate officer and
having an ExecLawyer, identified in the annual SEC filings and in ExecuComp. In both series,
we document a secular trend upwards. In the year 1995, 66% of the S&P 1,500 index firms had
General Counsel as a corporate officer while 33% of the firm had an ExecLawyer; the
percentage increases to 81% and 44%, respectively by the year 2012.

Our numbers on

ExecLawyer are a few percent lower than those reported in Kwak, et al. (2012), who document
this pattern with the addition of legal affairs officers and some other variations such as legal or
political officers. Conditional on having an ExecLawyer, the remaining statistics in Table 1
report that ExecLawyer compensation has increased from $631 thousand to $1.85 million while
the CEO compensation has increased from $2.41 million to $6.4 million in constant 2012 dollars
from 1995 to 2012. Executive lawyers’ pay as a fraction of CEO pay remains about 37% in our
sample period. For every 1% increase in shareholder value, ExecLawyers make another $55,000
in equity income on average, a much smaller fraction (6%) of wealth performance sensitivity

15

compared to the CEOs’ delta. 17 About one third of the ExecLawyer deltas are zero, a point we
re-visit empirically.

IV.a. Importance of lawyers: Methodology
To measure to what extent differences among individual general counsels matter, we use
a lawyer fixed effect model, following Bertrand and Schoar (2003), Malmendier and Tate (2009)
and Custodio and Metgzer (2014). Bertrand and Schoar use the movement of executives across
firms to gauge how much variation in the performance metrics of relevant firms is due to
individual managers. A recent accounting literature applies this methodology to document
significant top mangers’ individual effects on firms’ voluntary disclosures, tax avoidance, and a
wide range of financial reporting choices (Bamber, Jiang and Wang, 2010; Jiang, Petroni, and
Wang, 2010; Dyreng, Hanlon and Maydew, 2010; Ge, Matsumoto and Zhang, 2011).
We use this methodology to accomplish two goals. First, individual lawyer fixed effects
analysis allows us to test for importance of lawyers across the multi-task dimensions of
compliance, monitoring and business development. Second, the analysis allows for a relative
quantification metric – comparing the importance of individual lawyers across firms relative to
the importance of CEOs.
In our implementation, we use all general counsels, not simply those we classify as being
in the top executive offices by salary, because, not being constrained to have compensation data,
we can more cleanly identify true moves of lawyers across firms. We limit the sample to lawyers
who move among firms. Our estimating equations are a sequence as follows, with yijt being some

17

Our estimates of CEO delta are very close to those in Core and Guay (1999) and Chava and Purnanandam (2010).
In fact, Chava and Purnanandam (2010) show CFO’s delta has a mean of $71 thousand in their sample, which is
slightly higher than our delta estimates for executive lawyers.

16

compliance, monitoring or business development outcome for individual manager i in firm j at
time t:
(i)

y ijt = Firm fixed effects + Firm fixed effects × Year

(ii ) y ijt = Firm fixed effects + Firm fixed effects × Year + Lawyer fixed effects
(iii ) y ijt = Firm fixed effects + Firm fixed effects × Year + Lawyer fixed effects + CEO fixed effects

The main inference from this method comes from calculating the increase in adjusted r-squared
moving from equation (i) to (ii). Because a lawyer fixed effect may be spuriously correlated with
CEO effects, which the literature finds to be robustly important, we follow Ge et al. (2011) in
including equation (iii) to test whether the economic and statistical significance of lawyer effects
holds in the presence of CEO effects. Also, particular for our analysis of lawyers, firm-level
trends in outcomes may be spuriously correlated with the role of lawyers, the importance of
which has been growing over time in firms. Thus, we include firm-level linear trends which are
captured by the interactions of firm fixed effects and year in the estimation. One should take
caution in interpreting the magnitude of CEO fixed effects in equation (iii) because we restrict
the sample to general counsel movers but not CEO movers. We provide a better magnitude
comparison in Appendix Table 2, which reports the CEO fixed effects estimation using a CEO
mover sample.

IV.b. Importance of lawyers: Results
Table 2 reports the lawyer fixed effects results, mimicking the layout of Bertrand and
Schoar (2003). The table reads down by rows, with the first row under each variable reporting
the adjusted r-squared for a model with just firm fixed effects and a linear trend. For the
compliance measures, these adjusted r-squareds for AAERs and insider trading are 0.785 and
0.342 respectively. The addition of a lawyer fixed effect (the second row) increases the r-squared
17

to 0.82 and 0.397, representing an average improvement of 0.045 (4.5 percentage of variation
explained in increment). The F-tests for the joint significance of the lawyer fixed effects have pvalues of <0.01. These results are robust to the addition of CEO fixed effect (the third row).
In terms of monitoring, the lawyer fixed effects improve r-squared by rather consistent
increments of 0.079, 0.072 and 0.066 (7.9, 7.2 and 6.6 percentage of the variation) in the three
litigation variables.
The lawyer fixed effects explain smallest increments in the business development
variables. The r-squareds increase by 0.008 (capital expenditures), 0 (R&D), 0.046 (business
segments), and 0.019 (filing a patent). Together, including the zero effect for R&D, these
increments on average represent a smaller 1.8 percentage change over the r-squared without the
lawyer fixed effects. 18 As noted in the data section, these business development variables are
noisy measures of the effort of lawyers in strategic planning and strategic risk management, and
thus we find the lower importance of lawyers here to be intuitive.
To put these magnitudes into perspective, we compare the increments in r-squared
explained by lawyers to that explained by CEOs in a CEO mover analysis presented in Appendix
Table 2. We are cautious in interpreting specific line items because, for example, individual CEO
fixed effects also have moderate contribution to r-squared for business development, making the
lawyer fixed effects look very strong in business development as a comparison. Instead, taking a
simple average of r-squared increments across all variables reported, we find that lawyer fixed
effects explain 51% as much variation as CEO fixed effects. We interpret it as suggesting that
lawyers are 51% as relevant in these domains as CEOs.

18

Neither lawyer nor CEO heterogeneity has power in explaining corporate innovation as measured by R&D, which
is consistent with the findings of Cho, Halford, Hsu and Ng (2016).

18

IV.c.

Importance of lawyers: Hiring methodology
Interpreting the lawyer fixed effects results with generalizable causality language could

be problematic if lawyers that move among firms are mobile because of the individual’s
capability in compliance, monitoring, or business development. Thus, we implement a second
approach that identifies off the decision of hiring executive lawyers. We ask whether firms that
hire an ExecLawyer experience changes in compliance, monitoring, and business development
that are different compared to those not hiring, using a propensity score matched difference-indifferences approach. This approach has endogeneity issues of its own: even after propensity
matching firms on observables, unobservables such as the future need for an executive lawyer
may determine the hiring decision. The sign of the bias should be conservative for compliance
and monitoring: if a firm has a future need for governance, it is likely that the firm is entering a
phase of increased pressure on their governance, thereby biasing downward any positive effect of
hiring an ExecLawyer on such outcomes. 19 Thus, even though this approach cannot be
ascertained to be free of selection, it imposes an opposite selection compared to the previous
methodology – looking at all hires compared to none (here) versus looking among
heterogeneities within the hires and fires (the lawyer fixed effects method). Thus, if the two
methods produce similar results, the inference is quite suggestive of lawyers being important on
these dimensions.
For our tests, we define the treated firms to be those that hired executive lawyers who
stayed for at least three years and had no executive lawyers in the prior two years, and control
firms to be those that had no executive lawyers from two years prior to two years after. For each

19 We cannot make this conservative claim for business development, and in fact our instincts are that the bias
would likely be anticonservative. However, we include the results only for parallel reporting of results and
transparency.

19

treated firm, we first find the set of matched firm using the year of hiring and one-digit SIC
industry and then draw three nearest neighboring firms using the hiring propensity. The hiring
propensity is estimated by running a logit model with dependent variable taking the value of one
for executive lawyer hiring firms and zero for non-hiring firms. The independent variables
(lagged one year prior to the hiring year) include measures of gatekeeping failures—AAER
fraud, SEC insider trading, securities fraud—as well as the natural logarithm of market
capitalization, market-adjusted returns, leverage, ROA, firm age, capex, R&D, business
segments, time trend, time trend squared, and one-digit SIC industry fixed effects.
Appendix Table 3 reports the comparison between executive lawyer hiring and nonhiring firms in compliance and monitoring failures, business development, and other independent
variables used in the propensity estimation model. Prior to the matching procedure, the firms
differ in potentially important dimensions. Firms that hire ExecLawyer tend to have greater
incidence of compliance failures, are smaller in market capitalization, have higher leverage and
more business segments but lower market-to-book, ROA, and R&D expenses. These differences
confirm the need to use a matched sample. Appendix Table 4 model (1) reports the fitting of the
propensity estimation model. The “post-match” columns in Appendix Table 3 show that after
propensity matching, the treated firms and control firms are no longer statistically different in
any of these measures in the year prior to hiring.

IV.d. Importance of lawyers: Hiring results
Table 3 (Panel A) reports the results of the collapsed difference-in-differences tests with
hiring year and one-digit SIC industry fixed effects. This is the most stringent specification for
this methodology following Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004). The dependent variable is

20

the change in outcome (compliance, monitoring or business development) from the pre-hiring to
post-hiring period. Each firm has one observation, and estimation weights balance the matching.
For example, in this collapsed specification the AAERs dependent variable would be the
occurrence of any AAER (the max over a 0-1 variable) in the two years following the hire,
excluding the hiring year, minus the occurrence of any AAER in the two years prior to the hire.
Our sample comprises 536 firms hiring ExecLawyers and 792 matched non-hiring firms. Odd
numbered columns are the raw difference-in-differences, and even columns include the hire year
and industry fixed effects.
We find that the two compliance failure measures are strongly significant (both
economically and statistically) in the direction of the executive lawyer being a mechanism in
improving compliance. 20 The incidence of AAERs in hiring firms is 0.029 to 0.033 lower (in
columns 2 and 3 respectively) compared to control firms over the two-year period after the hiring
of ExecLawyer. Using the pre-hiring mean (from Appendix Table 3) as benchmark, these
numbers imply a 44.4 to 50.5 percentage lower annual prevalence of these compliance breaches.
Likewise, firms hiring an ExecLawyer experience a 46.9 to 60.3 percentage reduction in insider
trading breaches. Averaging the improvements over all the compliance columns in panel A of
Table 3, we conclude that hiring an ExecLawyer reduces compliance breaches by 50%.
Likewise, in Panel B, hiring firms exhibit fewer securities fraud incidents and general
lawsuits. Just focusing on the percentage change rows relative to the pre-hire mean, we find that
hiring an ExecLawyer reduces securities fraud and general lawsuits by 32% on average. The
results for the securities fraud purged of AAERs are in the same direction, yet with less power.

20

Our findings are consistent with Kwak, et al. (2012)’s and Jagolinzer, et al. (2011)’s studies which find
compliance improvements with the presence of super lawyers in the firm.

21

We do not find any effect of hiring an executive lawyer on business development except
for some weak evidence on business segments and on patent filings, working in opposite
directions. We interpret any results with caution here because we cannot sign the selection bias
of these tests. In the case of the gatekeeping results, we believe the bias is conservative in that
firms in need of gatekeeping in the future (and thus hiring) would be ones expecting an increase
in governance breaches.
To speak to the selection concern that the lawyer may not be the mechanism of
governance improvement, we explore whether the hiring of ExecLawyers reflects an overall
strategy implemented by boards or CEOs to improve governance on many dimensions. We look
to other governance actions taken by the board or shareholders at the same time as hiring an
executive lawyer. Panel D reports the results; we find no effects timed to the executive lawyer
hiring.
For consistency to our Table 3 results, we also implement collapsed difference-indifferences estimation for the external hiring of General Counsel (rather than top five paid
ExecLawyers). The dependent variable is the change in outcome variables from pre-hiring to
post-hiring of General Counsel. The results (in both statistical significance and economic
magnitudes) are consistent with those presented in Table 3. We omit reporting these results for
brevity.
As a final robustness check to our results, we explore, following Desai and Dharmapala
(2006), whether the difference-in-differences results vary in subsamples with different
governance strength. Subsamples are formed using three independent corporate governance
measures. Appendix Table 5 reports collapsed difference-in-differences results in the same
specification as Table 3, but splitting the sample by institutional ownership (in columns (1) and

22

(2)), board independence (in columns (3) and (4)), and the G-index (in columns (5) and (6)). The
split by institutional ownership and board independence is based on the sample median while the
split by G-index is based on whether the value is above nine in the year of ExecLawyer hiring.
The prediction following Desai and Dharmapala (2006) is that governance improvements should
happen where they are needed the most. Firms that have higher institutional ownership, higher
board independence, and lower G-index are supposedly better governed firms.
Our results in Appendix Table 5 show that poorly governed hiring firms experience
larger improvement in AAER and general lawsuit mitigation than well governed firms,
compared to the matched sample. The same pattern, although without precision in the stringent
collapsed specification, is apparent in general lawsuits. The results on SEC alleged insider
trading, however seem mixed, perhaps due to incentives to do insider trading as related to these
endogenous splits. Although we cannot claim a strong causal interpretation to the story of poorly
governed firms improving the most because of endogeneity of the split, together the total set of
difference-in-differences hiring results do paint a picture of the importance of lawyers for
gatekeeping.

V.

Gatekeepers versus Window Dressing

V.a. Gatekeepers versus window dressing: Methodology
Our main agenda is to explore whether executive lawyers are induced to trade off
gatekeeping when they have incentive contracts designed to reward business development
efforts. Our identification novelty is a comparison across two sets of firms, both hiring executive
lawyers. One set hires from law firms; the other, from other corporations. Our main identifying
assumption is that executive lawyers hired from law firms are initially less likely to reduce their

23

gatekeeping effort as a reaction to equity incentives than are executive lawyers poached from
other corporations. We first motivate this assumption based on the source of hiring and then lay
out how we can use the source of hiring for a plausibly causal identification.
Executives that are hired from law firms have built both their human capital and their
reputational capital in lawyering not corporate strategic decision-making. These lawyers have
rarely worked outside law firms. By training and by practice, gatekeeping comes more naturally
than risk-taking, reinforced by the conservative biases of law practice and by the reality that the
newly-hired law firm lawyer has all of her reputation at stake in the event of a gatekeeping
failure. Once inside the firm, the sociology literature on professionalism guides our thinking
about the transformation of lawyers with professional identities. Goode (1957) defines a
professional community (e.g., doctors, lawyers, professors, etc.) as occupations where all
members are bounded by a sense of identity and common values. Hall (1968) documents that
professionals working inside an organization may identify less with the organization compared to
other employees, because of conflicts between administrative imperatives and professional
norms. Consistent with our assumption most directly, Wallace (1995) finds that lawyers working
in corporations are significantly less committed to the legal profession than those working in law
firms.
Putting these ideas together, law firm lawyers (i) exhibit loyalty to their professional
association, (ii) must go through a learning curve to understand the business development
strategy of the firm, (iii) must change their trained risk-aversion habit as a lawyer and learn to be
more comfortable with risk, and (iv) must be willing to step away from their stock of
reputational capital. All of these factors imply that law firm-hired lawyers should be less likely

24

on average than corporate-hired lawyers to respond to equity incentives in such a way as trading
off gatekeeping for strategic input.
Our comparison of the effect of equity incentives on law firm hired-lawyers versus
corporate hired-lawyers does not presume that corporations exogenously choose the source of
hiring. Our design in this section begins by levelling firms on the ex ante propensity to select one
hiring source over the other and then absorbs any ex post outcome differences induced by the
hiring source by interacting the post indictor with the hiring source. Below we lay out these
details, and the exogeneity assumption that we need.
Our estimating equation for our main test on equity incentives is as follows:
yit = a1 Postit + a 2CorporateHirei + a 3 Postit CorporateHirei + µ year + µ industry + µ hireyear
+ a 4 ExecLawyerDeltai ,hireyear + a 5CorporateHirei ExecLawyerDeltai ,hireyear
+ a 6 Postit ExecLawyerDeltai ,hireyear + a 7 Postit CorporateHirei ExecLawyerDeltai ,hireyear + e it

(1)

yit is the outcome measure of compliance, monitoring, or business development. Postit is an
indicator being equal to zero for the two years before a hire and one for the two years following
the hire, excluding the hire year. (Our results hold extending the ex post duration to three years.)
The sample is firms that hire an ExecLawyer externally from either another company (treatment
group:

CorporateHire
= 1)

or

a

law

firm

(control

group:

CorporateHire=0).

ExecLawyerDeltai ,hireyear is the compensation delta of the ExecLawyer i, defined only at the

hiring year to avoid confounding effect of performance. The delta primarily captures sign-on
incentive contracting. Although ExecLawyerDeltai ,hireyear is in a future time point for the Post =
0 observations, its interaction with CorporateHire allows us to difference out a selection effect.
(Our results hold if we remove this level effect.) Our variable of interest is α 7 , the coefficient on

25

the

difference-in-differences

term

interacted

with

the

compensation

delta

Postit CorporateHirei ExecLawyerDeltai ,hireyear .

Before we estimate equation (1), we need to propensity-score match firms to deal with ex
ante selection of hiring from a corporation versus a law firm. The idea is that for every law firm
hire, we find matches in the larger pool of firms that hire from a corporation to form a sample
comparable on observables. Appendix Table 4 model (2) reports the results of the logit
propensity estimation with the dependent variable taking on the value of one if a firm hires an
executive lawyer from a law firm and zero if a firm hires from a corporation. The independent
variables are identical to those used to estimate the propensity of executive lawyer hiring
decision as in model (1). For each firm that hires an executive lawyer from a law firm, we first
find the set of matched firm using the year of hiring and one-digit SIC industry and then find
three nearest neighbors in propensity score. Appendix Table 6 compares firm characteristics after
matching for the corporate hire firms and the law firm hire firms in the year prior to hiring,
finding no statistically significant differences by hiring source.
It could be that the source of hiring is still endogenous to ex post outcomes. However, our
inference comes not from a difference-in-differences estimator but from the difference-indifference estimator interacted with delta. That is, we only interpret

Postit CorporateHirei

as

absorbing any ex post selection in hiring from the corporation. De facto, however, after
propensity-score matching and differencing, we find little-to-no evidence for any ex ante or ex
post selection by hiring source.
Our identification does rely, however, on one exogeneity condition for interpreting our
main variable of interest, α 7 : Had the firm hired an ExecLawyer from a corporation, the firm’s
outcome sensitivity to equity incentives would have evolved similarly as had they hired from a
26

law firm, once we propensity match, control for both the ex-ante and ex post selection of hiring
from a corporation (CorporateHire, Post, and Post*CorporateHire), and control for selection on
any incentive pay needs of the firm (ExecLawyerDelta, CorporateHire*ExecLawyerDelta). With
so many differencing and interactions, it is perhaps easier to state the opposite – what it would
take for our identification to fail. It could be that the firm’s selection of hiring sources may
reflect some omitted variable correlated with the effectiveness of equity incentives. That is, it is
possible that some unobservable factor could drive both the selection of hiring sources and the
sensitivity of corporate outcomes to equity incentives. To address this concern, we implement a
triple difference form as follows:
yit = a 1 Post it + a 2 CorporateHirei + a 3 Post it CorporateHirei + µ year + µ industry + µ hireyear
+ a 4 ExecLawyerDeltai ,hireyear + a 5CorporateHirei ExecLawyerDeltai ,hireyear
+ a 6 Post it ExecLawyerDeltai ,hireyear + a 7 Post it CorporateHirei ExecLawyerDeltai ,hireyear
+ a 8 Post it CEODeltai ,hireyear + a 9 Post it CorporateHirei CEODeltai ,hireyear + e it

We introduce

CEODeltai ,hireyear

(2)

into the equation, which is the level of equity incentives of the CEO

in the hiring year of the ExecLawyer. In essence, we are forcing the comparison to difference
around the endogenous use of equity incentives for firms. Contract theory predicts that firms
with different contracting environment vary in levels and sensitivities of optimal incentives.
Studies on executive compensation (e.g. Core, Holthausen and Larcker (1999), Armstrong,
Jagolinzer, and Larcker (2010)) suggest that both innate firm economic characteristics such as
size, complexity, growth, and firm corporate governance characteristics affect managerial
compensation.

CEODeltai ,hireyear

and its sensitivity to outcomes should capture the unobservable

differences in compensation contracting environment between the treatment group and matched
firms, if there are any.

27

To deal with the concerns of serial correlation and over-rejection of the null, we adopt as
robustness the collapsed estimation procedure recommended by Bertrand, Duflo, and
Mullainathan (2004). We collapse our time series observation around ExecLawyer hiring into
pre and post periods and calculate the change in outcome measures of the treatment group and
the control group respectively. The form of this estimation equation is given below, where Δ
implies the average in the post period minus the average in the pre period:
Dyt = l1CorporateHirei + l2 ExecLawyerDeltai ,hireyear + l3CorporateHirei ExecLawyerDeltai ,hireyear
+ l4CEODeltai ,hireyear + l5CorporateHirei CEODeltai ,hireyear + µ industry + µ hireyear + e i

(3)

V.b. Gatekeepers versus window dressing: Compliance results
Table 4 reports the double and triple differencing results as to whether equity incentives
impact executive lawyers’ effort exerted in compliance. Columns (1) to (3) consider AAER fraud
outcomes, and columns (4) to (6), SEC alleged insider trading. In columns (1) and (4), we find
no difference in ex post compliance by hiring source. The main variable of interest in Table 4 is
Post*CorporateHire*Log(ExecLawyerDelta), where we have added $10,000 to the delta before
taking the natural logarithm transformation so that we do not simply identify off the skewness.
Columns (3) and (6) add in the further differencing around the equity incentive level of the CEO.
We include a series of fixed effects for industry, year and hiring year, and cluster errors at the
firm-hire level. Overall, we have 414 firm-hires which result in about four times that number of
observations.
We find little evidence that equity incentives divert or enhance compliance efforts, as
manifested in either AAER fraud or insider trading. The coefficient of interest is insignificant
across all columns. The lack of an effect of incentive pay on compliance outcomes is perhaps to
be expected because of steep reputation costs to infractions (Desai, Hogan, and Wilkins, 2006;
28

Karpoff, Lee, and Martin, 2008). 21 Likewise, CEO deltas play no role in compliance outcomes in
this setup.

V.c. Gatekeepers versus window dressing: Monitoring results
Table 5 repeats the exercise of Table 4, but this time for the monitoring aspect of
gatekeeping. We measure monitoring effectiveness in three dimensions – securities frauds,
securities lawsuits excluding AAER, and general lawsuits. Again, we first start by looking at
selection gauged ex post and find no evidence that the hiring source predicts firm monitoring
outcomes. The coefficients on Post*CorporateHire in columns (1) (securities fraud), (4) (AAER
purged securities fraud) and (7) (general lawsuits) are insignificant.
Turning

to

the

main

results,

the

coefficients

on

Post*CorporateHire*Log(ExecLawyerDelta) in columns (2), (3), (5), (6), (8) and (9) are all
positive and significant. We defer interpreting any economic magnitude until we show the more
stringent collapsed version of these tests.
We implement two more stringent specifications: (i) a specification where we focus on
only those lawyers who are hired with positive delta, and (ii) a collapsed specification per
Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullanathan (2004). Table 6 limits our sample to firms that hire
ExecLawyers with positive compensation delta, eliminating lawyers with no sign-on equity
incentives. Even though the number of observations drops by 40%, the coefficient estimates on
the variable of interest Post*CorporateHire*Log(ExecLawyerDelta) hardly change in our new
specification.

21

In the monitoring results to be presented in the next section, we include robustness tables, limiting to only positive
executive lawyer delta firms and implementing a collapsed version as well. For compliance, we find no results in
these alternative specifications as well, and thus omit them for space considerations.

29

Finally, Table 7 presents our most stringent specification, a collapsed version of the
difference in differences as in equation (3). The dependent variable is the change of governance
measures from the pre-hiring to post-hiring period, thus each firm has one observation. Our
variable of interest is CorporateHire*Log(ExecLawyerDelta). As in the prior tables, the
coefficient on this variable is positive and significant for securities fraud and AAER purged
securities lawsuits. The result is not statistically significant for general lawsuits, although as in
the prior two tables, the coefficients across all of these columns are relatively consistent in
magnitude. In sum, under our plausibly causal design, across Tables 5 – 7, our evidence suggests
that the optimal contracting of lawyers into strategic initiatives diverts lawyers away from
monitoring, resulting in an increase in the likelihood of a firm committing monitoring breaches.
What is the economic significance of the results? We focus on a one standard deviation
higher value of the Log(ExecLawyerDelta) in the cross section at the hiring year, or an
equivalent $22,000 larger ExecLawyerDelta above the mean value. These same lawyers hired
with a $22,000 larger delta at sign-on have an approximately $60,000 larger delta two years after
hiring, which is perhaps the more appropriate way to state the comparison. After considering the
bulk of zeros from the interaction terms Post and CorporateHire 22, we calculate, shown at the
bottom of Table 7, that a one standard deviation larger Log(ExecLawyerDelta) increases the
probability of securities lawsuit by 0.013. We refer to this 0.013 as the magnitude of governance
reduction due to equity incentives. For comparison purposes, we calculate the magnitude of
securities lawsuit prevention associated with the hiring of ExecLawyer, based on Table 3 results,
to be 0.017. We refer to this 0.017 as the magnitude of governance improvement brought by a
typical ExecLawyer. Both numbers (0.013 and 0.017) are then compared to the pre-hiring mean
22

Alternatively, a one standard deviation increase in Post*CorporateHire*Log(ExecLawyerDelta) is more than twotimes larger.

30

of the governance failure measure (Appendix Table 3) to calculate the percentage of governance
improvement associated with the hiring of ExecLawyer and the percentage of governance
improvement unwinded by equity incentives.
Our results imply that whereas on average the hiring of a lawyer implies a 31.4%
reduction in securities fraud (in column 2 of Table 7), when the lawyer is hired with high equity
incentives, she only reduces fraud by 6.6%. Thus, under our interpretation, the lawyer exchanges
24.8% of the fraud prevention for effort in other endeavors when granted high equity incentives.

V.d. Gatekeepers versus window dressing: Business Development results
Table 8 reports the triple-difference specifications testing whether a firm’s contracting
with equity incentives impacts executive lawyers’ effort exerted in business development. As
before, we first present a non-interacted specification in columns (1), (4), (7) and (10) to test
whether ex post business development outcomes differ by hiring source. We find no evidence for
this selection. In columns (2), (5), (8), and (11), we present the triple interaction results for
capital expenditure, R&D, business segment and patent filing dependent variables respectively.
We omit the double differencing for brevity because the results look very similar to the triple
differencing. In columns (3), (6), (9), and (12), we report results for the sample dropping
ExecLawyers with zero sign-on equity incentives.
We find evidence consistent with our intuition that equity incentives should be associated
with a firm contracting the ExecLawyer for business development. Firms that hire ExecLawyers
from other corporations and provide them with a one standard deviation higher sign-on equity
incentive packages exhibit 0.017 more capital expenditures-to-fixed assets (a 5 percentage
change) in the coming two years, relative to those firms hiring from law firms. The coefficient in

31

column (3) is similar to that for column (2), but the estimate is noisier with the smaller sample.
In columns (5) and (6), we find that likewise, equity incentives for ExecLawyers have
implications for R&D going forward, although this is only true for those with non-zero sign-on
incentive contracts. Firms that hire ExecLawyers poached from other corporations and give them
higher sign-on equity incentive packages exhibit 0.005 more R&D expenditures-to-assets (an
almost 8 percentage change per year) in the coming two years, relative to those firms hiring from
law firms with positive incentive deltas. Finally, firms providing equity incentives to lawyers
have a 0.022-0.058 higher likelihood of filing a patent (a 6-15 percentage change) relative to the
control. 23

VI.

Conclusion
Internal governance is an idea that has grown in popularity among executives, as they

have increasingly become exposed to regulation and punishment for misconduct. In this paper,
we have documented the importance of executive lawyers, arguably the most significant emblem
of internal governance, to the firm in their multiple tasks: compliance, monitoring, and business
development. Prior literature guides our intuition that individual executives matter (Bertrand and
Schoar, 2003; Malmendier and Tate, 2009). Recently, Custodio and Metzger (2014) document
that financial expertise matters inside the firm. We introduce legal expertise into the box,
documenting that general counsels command meaningfully large governance and business
development fixed effects. The work on the importance of external lawyers on M&A

23

We want to exert caution in interpreting these business development results. The results become less precisely
estimated in a collapsed specification, which we omit from the tables for brevity. Compared to the gatekeeping
measures, measurement of the mechanism of business development effort by lawyers is much less precise. We do
not want to over-claim on our business development tests, but hopefully to encourage more research on this effort.

32

negotiations and outcomes by Krishnan and Masulis (2013) and Karsten, Malmendier and
Sautner (2014) is a nice complement and also serves this motivating purpose.
For our purposes, however, gatekeeping and strategic advisory roles of lawyers in
executive offices together imply a tension of time allocation. We offer evidence that executive
lawyers are incentivized to compromise internal governance monitoring time when faced with
the call to add strategic input; they do not, however, compromise compliance, implying that
these executive lawyers on average remain gatekeepers, at least in some dimensions, even
though corporations use their intellectual property expertise and other legal expertise in business
development planning.
Coffee (2002) might fairly interpret our results that compensation distorts gatekeeping.
Surely it is difficult to reconcile the duties of an executive agent (Berle and Means, 1932) with
those of a reputation intermediary positioned by owners to prevent managerial wrongdoing
(Coffee, 2006). We have taken a view more in line with optimal contracting, because legal
expertise seems increasingly valuable in strategic decisions in our information economy. We
conclude with the thought that as long as intellectual property continues to be a major part of
production, legal expertise will continue to be needed in decision making, and the lines between
legal value-creators and legal guardians will remain blurry. Intellectual property is not going
away.

Table 1: General Counsel and Executive Lawyer Characteristics over Time
This table presents General Counsel (GC) and Executive Lawyer (ExecLawyer) characteristics (mean) by fiscal year. Our
sample comprises firm years in ExecuComp from 1995 to 2012. Statistics reported in (1)-(3) are for the whole sample while
statistics reported in (4)-(9) are for firm years with the presence of ExecLawyer. ExecLawyer is an indicator variable equal to
one if a general counsel appears in ExecuComp as one of the top paid executives. ExecLawyer pay is the executive lawyer's
total compensation (TDC1 in ExecuComp) in constant 2012 dollars. CEO pay is the CEO's total compensation.
ExecLawyer/CEO delta is the sensitivity of the value of the ExecLawyer/CEO’s accumulated equity-based compensation
(including both stocks and options) to a one-percent change in the stock price, in constant 2012 (million) dollars.

Table 2: General Counsel Fixed Effects Estimates of Compliance, Monitoring and Business Development Using General
Counsel Movers
This table presents the general counsel fixed effects. Each row represents a regression for the dependent variable to the left. The sample is limited
to firm-year observations covering general counsel movers. The fixed effects included are: firm fixed effects in row 1; firm and general counsel
fixed effects in row 2; firm, CEO, and general counsel fixed effects in row 3. A firm specific linear time trend is included in all regressions.
Reported in the second and third columns are F-tests for the joint significance of the CEO fixed effects and general counsel fixed effects. For
each F-test, we report the value of the F-statistic, the p-value, and the number of constraints.The final two columns report the adjusted R-squared
and the incremental adjusted R-squared explained by general counsel. Our sample comprises firm years in ExecuComp from 1995 to 2012.
Detailed variable definitions are provided in Appendix Table 1.

Table 3: Collapsed Difference-in-Differences Test for the Importance of ExecLawyers
This table presents the collapsed difference-in-differences tests around the external hiring of ExecLawyer. The dependent variable is the change of compliance,
monitoring, business development or other governance measures from pre-hiring to post-hiring period, thus each firm has one observation. The treatment group is
firms hiring ExecLawyers, and the control group is non-hirng firms that are matched within the year-industry-size and by the propensity score of hiring an
ExecLawyer. Post is set to zero for the two years prior to the hiring of ExecLawyer, and one for the two years subsequent to the hiring. The year of hiring is tossed
out. Our sample comprises firm years in ExecuComp from 1995 to 2012. Detailed variable definitions are provided in Appendix Table 1. Standard errors are
clustered at the firm level. Superscripts ***, **, * indicate statistical significance level at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Table 4: The Effect of ExecLawyer Equity Incentives on Compliance
This table presents double and triple differencing estimations of the effect of ExecLawyer incentive pay on compliance
failures. The treatment group is firms hiring ExecLawyers from other corporations, and the control group is firms that hire
ExecLawyers from law firms, matched within the year-industry-size and by the propensity score of hiring from law firms vs.
corporations. Post is set to zero for the two years prior to the hiring of ExecLawyer, and one for the two years subsequent to
the hiring. The year of hiring is tossed out. Our sample comprises firm years in ExecuComp from 1995 to 2012. Detailed

Table 5: The Effect of ExecLawyer Equity Incentives on Monitoring
This table presents double and triple differencing estimations of the effect of ExecLawyer incentive pay on monitoring failures. The treatment group is firms hiring ExecLawyers from
other corporations, and the control group is firms that hire ExecLawyers from law firms, matched within the year-industry-size and by the propensity score of hiring from law firms vs.
corporations. Post is set to zero for the two years prior to the hiring of ExecLawyer, and one for the two years subsequent to the hiring. The year of hiring is tossed out. Governance
reduction given a standard deviation change in ExecLawyer delta in the hiring year is presented at the bottom of the table. It is then compared to the pre-hiring mean of the governance
failure measure (Appendix Table 3) to calculate the percentage of reduction. Our sample comprises firm years in ExecuComp from 1995 to 2012. Detailed variable definitions are
provided in Appendix Table 1. Standard errors are clustered at the firm level. Superscripts ***, **, * indicate statistical significance level at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Table 7: The Effect of ExecLawyer Equity Incentives on Monitoring - Collapsed Estimation
This table presents collapsed double and triple differencing estimations of the effect of ExecLawyer incentive pay on monitoring failures. The treatment group is firms hiring
ExecLawyers from other corporations, and the control group is firms that hire ExecLawyers from law firms, matched within the year-industry-size and by the propensity score of hiring
from law firms vs. corporations. The dependent variable is the change of monitoring failure measure from pre- to post-hiring period. Governance reduction given a standard deviation
change in ExecLawyer delta in the hiring year is presented at the bottom of the table. For comparison purpose, we also calculate the magnitude of governance improvement associated
with the hiring of ExecLawyer, based on Table 3 results. Both numbers are then compared to the pre-hiring mean of the governance failure measure (Appendix Table 3) to calculate the
percentage of governance improvement associated with the hiring of ExecLawyer and the percentage of governance improvement unwinded by the equity incentive. Our sample
comprises firm years in ExecuComp from 1995 to 2012. Detailed variable definitions are provided in Appendix Table 1.Standard errors are clustered at the firm level. Superscripts ***,
**, * indicate statistical significance level at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Appendix Table 2: CEO Fixed Effects on Compliance, Monitoring and Business Development Using CEO
Movers
This table presents CEO fixed effects with CEO movers. Each row represents a regression for the dependent variable to the
left. The sample is limited to firm-year observations for CEOs that move. The fixed effects included are: firm fixed effects in
row 1; firm and CEO fixed effects in row 2. A firm specific linear time trend is included in all regressions. Reported in the
second column are F-tests for the joint significance of the CEO fixed effects. For each F-test, we report the value of the Fstatistic, the p-value, and the number of constraints. The final two columns report the adjusted R-squared and the incremental
adjusted R-squared explained by CEOs. Our sample comprises firm years in ExecuComp from 1995 to 2012. Detailed
variable definitions are provided in Appendix Table 1.

Appendix Table 4: Logit Regression on ExecLawyer Hiring
This table presents the logit regression that predicts the hiring of ExecLawyer. The dependent variable in column (1)
takes on the value of one if a firm hires an ExecLawyer but has no ExecLawyer in any of the two prior years, and zero if a
firm has no ExecLawyer in the current year as well as any of the prior two years. The dependent variable in column (2)
takes on the value of one if a firm hires an ExecLawyer from a law firm, and zero if a firm poaches an ExecLawyer from
another corporation. Our sample comprises firm years in ExecuComp from 1995 to 2012. Detailed variable definitions
are provided in Appendix Table 1. Standard errors are clustered at the firm level. Superscripts ***, **, * indicate
statistical significance level at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Appendix Table 5: The Importance of ExecLawyer - Governance Splits
This table presents the collapsed difference-in-differences tests around the external hiring of Execlawyer using subsamples split by govenance
strength. The dependent variable is the change of compliance and monitoring from the pre-hiring to post-hiring period, thus each firm has one
observation. The treatment group is firms hiring ExecLawyers, and the control group is non-hirng firms that are matched within the yearindustry-size and by the propensity score of hiring an ExecLawyer. Post is set to zero for the two years prior to the hiring of ExecLawyer, and
one for the two years subsequent to the hiring. The year of hiring is tossed out. Our sample comprises firm years in ExecuComp from 1995 to
2012. Detailed variable definitions are provided in Appendix Table 1. Standard errors are clustered at the firm level. Superscripts ***, **, *
indicate statistical significance level at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Appendix Table 6: Summary Statistics for Firms with ExecLawyers Hired from Corporations vs. Those with
ExecLawyers Hired from Law Firms
This table presents statistics for two matched groups of firms that hire ExecLawyers from different career sources. The
treatment group is firms hiring ExecLawyers from law firms, and the control group is firms that hire ExecLawyers from
other corporations. The two groups are matched within the year-industry-size and by the closest propensity score of hiring
from a law firm. This table presents firm and manager statistics after matching, taken in the year bofore the the ExecLawyer
is hired. Our sample comprises firm years in ExecuComp from 1995 to 2012. Detailed variable definitions are provided in
