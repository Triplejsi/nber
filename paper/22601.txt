Migration as a Test of the Happiness Set Point Hypothesis: Evidence from Immigration to
Canada

ABSTRACT
Strong versions of the set point hypothesis argue that subjective well-being measures reflect each
individual’s own personality and that deviations from that set point will tend to be short-lived,
rendering them poor measures of the quality of life. International migration provides an excellent
test of this hypothesis, since life circumstances and average subjective well-being differ greatly
among countries. Life satisfaction scores for immigrants to Canada from up to 100 source
countries are compared to those in the countries where they were born. With or without various
adjustments for selection effects, the average levels and distributions of life satisfaction scores
among immigrants mimic those of other Canadians rather than those in their source countries and
regions. This supports other evidence that subjective life evaluations, especially when averaged
across individuals, are primarily driven by life circumstances, and respond correspondingly when
those circumstances change.

Introduction
It has increasingly been suggested that measures of subjective well-being could provide umbrella
measures of human progress, able to capture the combined effects of income, health and the
social context as supports for better lives. But over several decades others have argued instead
that life evaluations change only temporarily with changes in life circumstances, reverting
thereafter to a set point that varies among individuals based on personality differences that in
turn may be driven by genetic differences. There is a growing literature attempting to show
which life events, if any, are followed by sustained changes in life evaluations. If the range of
such changes is sufficiently broad and representative of those variables generally agreed to
contribute to a good life, then the set point hypothesis need not stand in the way of using life
evaluations more generally as measures of human progress.

Various life events, including serious health problems, marriage, divorce, and unemployment
have been shown to have continuing consequences for life evaluations. There has been much less
study of the extent to which people are affected over the longer term by the social and
institutional contexts in which they live. Migration, especially international migration, takes
people from one social context into another, and hence offers a potentially powerful test. The set
point hypothesis supposes that the life evaluations of migrants might well rise or fall during the
migration process, reflecting some mix of the psychological costs of uprooting and the expected
benefits from moving to someplace better, but would eventually return to their pre-established
set points. On the other hand, if life evaluations are affected in the long term by the institutional
and social contexts in which people live, it might be expected that the average life evaluations of
migrants would come to match those of others in their new communities.

International migration provides a much more promising test-bed for research than does internal
migration, since there is much less difference in life evaluations among cities or regions within a
country than between countries. For example, the range of average life evaluations among cities
in Canada, or among states in the United States, is only one tenth as large as among the nations
surveyed by the Gallup World Poll. There are similarly larger international differences in the
institutions and social contexts that have been found to support high life evaluations. Thus
international migration takes people from countries with widely varying average life evaluations.

1

In the case we are studying in this paper, the immigrants are coming to Canada from up to 100
different countries, with life evaluations ranging from less than half those in Canada up to
Canadian levels and beyond. If the migrant groups are sufficiently large, and sufficiently
representative of the populations in the source countries, then their subsequent life evaluations in
Canada will provide a powerful test of the set point hypothesis. If the social and institutional
contexts provide strong long-term support for subjective well-being, then it should be expected
that migrants would in the longer term report life evaluations more like those in Canada than in
their countries of birth.

Literature Review
The idea that life events affect the happiness of individuals only in a transitory way first gained
prominence in adaptation-level theory (Brickman and Campbell, 1971). This view was supported
by the widely cited subsequent finding that lottery winners reported levels of happiness that were
not higher than controls, while recently paraplegic accident victims reported levels of happiness
that were higher than expected (Brickman, Coates, and Janoff-Bulman, 1978). In reality,
however, the findings of Brickman et al. (1978) were only partially in accordance with
adaptation theory. Most notably, although the accident victims did report levels of affect above
neutrality, which was unexpected, they were still substantially lower on average than controls.
Lucas (2007) has since confirmed that life satisfaction not only drops with the onset of disability,
but also does so more dramatically for more severe disabilities. What’s more, these decreases
remained remarkably stable for several years thereafter, and showed no sign of attenuation.
Other longitudinal studies have shown only partial adaptation to such other events as divorce,
widowhood, and unemployment (Lucas et al., 2004; Lucas, 2005; Luhmann et al., 2012). Even in
cases, such as marriage, where adaptation has appeared to be complete in some samples, this can
conceal divergence at the individual level or in different sub-populations (Headey, Muffels, and
Wagner, 2013; Lucas et al., 2004; Luhmann et al., 2012). Even in those longitudinal studies
where the married have been seen to revert to pre-marital happiness levels, the effect is restored
when the married are compared with unmarried others of the same age, who have on average
been sliding down a U-shape linking life evaluations with age in many countries (Yap et al.,
2012; Grover and Helliwell, 2014).

Set point theory in its strong form, in which all individuals have their own fixed long-term levels
of happiness or satisfaction, from which they deviate only temporarily, was developed in large
part from the results of Lykken and Tellegen (1996). Using data from the Minnesota Twin
Registry, they claimed that around half of the variation in happiness at any given time could also
be attributed to genetics, and that up to 80% of the variation in the ‘stable component’ was
heritable. There are several reasons, however, to take this result with caution. The first claim was
based on the correlations between levels of self-reported contentment among monozygotic twins
raised apart. This, however, does not necessarily imply that potential happiness is itself a stable
personality trait. Other genetically determined traits which are conducive to happiness in a
particular context could generate such a correlation, while still allowing for happiness to be
intrinsically variable. Furthermore, the salience of this genetic factor depends crucially on the
degree of environmental variability faced by Minnesotan twins. If their environments were fairly
comparable, then it is natural to expect that the role of genetics would appear comparatively
large. Lastly, with only one follow-up measurement, it was not possible to distinguish between
genuine stability and co-movement between the monozygotic twins over time.

Longitudinal and panel datasets have tended not to agree with the claim that an individual’s life
satisfaction cannot change over the long term. Retest correlation levels for life satisfaction
decline unambiguously over time. A meta-analysis by Veenhoven (1994) found that test-retest
correlations declined from around .6 for shorter time spans (months) to levels as low as .15 after
ten to fifteen years. Similarly, using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP)
from 1984 to 2000, Fujita and Diener (2005) found that the correlation between observations of
the same individual’s life satisfaction over time declined from .79 to .34 after 16 years even after
allowance for measurement error. Furthermore, approximately one quarter of individuals in the
GSOEP recorded changes in their five-year average for life satisfaction between the beginning
and the end of the observation period which were significant at p < .05, five times as many as
would have been predicted under the set point hypothesis. In many cases, changes were also
qualitatively large, with close to 10% of respondents recording changes of 3 points or more on a
10-point scale. Subsequent analysis of the GSOEP covering 1985 to 2005 yielded similar results
(Headey, 2008). Changes in life satisfaction over time in the GSOEP, as well as in similar panels
from Australia and the United Kingdom, can also be predicted by differences in altruistic vs.

3

materialistic goals, social participation, partner’s personality, working hours (above or below
desired levels), and exercise (Headey et al., 2013).

In spite of robust evidence that life satisfaction is only moderately stable in the long run,
individual-level regressions based on observed differences in material conditions tend to have
relatively limited explanatory power (Diener et al., 1999; Fujita and Diener, 2005; Headey et al.,
2013). Whether this is because material conditions and environment are unimportant, or because
important features of the environment, and especially the quality of the social context, have not
been adequately captured remains an open question. More nuanced measurements of financial
deprivation can perform substantially better than income alone (Christoph, 2010), while levels of
health and social capital have been shown to add substantially to explaining differences in
subjective well-being among individuals as well as among communities and countries (Helliwell
and Putnam, 2004).

International migration offers a valuable opportunity to observe the effects of large changes in
the material and social environment. The relationship between migration and subjective wellbeing has only recently become the focus of empirical study (Bartram, 2011, 2015; De Jong,
Chamratrithirong, and Tran, 2002; Dinesen, 2012; Frank, Hou, and Schellenberg, 2015; Ivlevs,
2015; Melzer, 2011; Melzer and Muffels, 2012; Nowok et al., 2013; Olgiati, Calvo, and
Berkman, 2013; Senik, 2014; Switek, 2016). In the most commonly studied case of migration—
immigration into countries with relatively high subjective well-being levels —it has routinely

been observed that international migrants report lower life satisfaction on average than natives of
their host country (de Vroome and Hooghe, 2014; Frank et al., 2016; Safi, 2010). In several
instances, this gap was explained by accounting for the effects of perceived discrimination (Safi,
2010) or differences in occupational status and social support (de Vroome and Hooghe, 2014).

Previous research on the life satisfaction of international migrants has not focused on the
implications for set point theory, although some recent research considers the extent to which
social norms and subjective well-being are sustained during the migration process, and hence
could reflect deeply ingrained aspects of culture. In recent research using data from the European
Social Survey, Senik (2014) argues for a cultural component in subjective well-being. She finds

4

that emigrants from France, where average life satisfaction is significantly below predicted levels
in some international happiness regressions 1, remain below the new average in their host
countries. This relationship also held, in terms of its sign, for emigrants from six of the seven
western-European countries studied. Interaction terms for immigrants who had resided in their
host country for 10 or 20 years, however, did indicate a degree of convergence toward the
national-level fixed effects for natives. In the case of migrants from France, where social trust
levels are low, this pattern is consistent with what would be predicted by other studies showing
that migrants have social trust assessments partway between those in their countries of birth and
of residence (Dinesen, 2012; Soroka et al., 2007; Rice and Feldman, 1997). Similar results for
life satisfaction, which depends heavily on social trust, have also been achieved using data from
the European Values Survey, showing life satisfaction for European migrants tended to be an
‘alloy’ incorporating the levels in both the host and origin countries (Voicu and Vasile, 2014).

Helliwell, Wang and Xu (2016) test the relative importance of culture versus experience by
examining the immigration footprints for social trust, generosity, and confidence in specific
national institutions, making use of a fully global sample involving immigrants to and from more
than 130 countries. These results support the notion that social norms are deeply rooted in longstanding cultures, yet are nonetheless subject to adaptation when there are major changes in the
surrounding circumstances and environment. In particular, the effect of source-country social
trust is strongly significant, with a size about one-third as large as that from trust levels in the
destination countries where the migrant now lives. The footprint for another social norm,
generosity, is also significant, although not as large. In contrast, trust in the national institutions
of the new country, where footprint effects would not be expected, indeed shows no such effects.

Since there are few longitudinal data sets suitable for studying the effects of migration, the
majority of studies listed above are based on analysis of cross-sectional differences between
migrants and natives, or between more and less recent migrants. In a recent study of the
emigration intentions of individuals from Europe and central Asia, Ivlevs (2015) found a
U-shaped relationship between life satisfaction and emigration intentions, with those reporting

However, France’s observed subjective well-being is slightly above the predicted value in the World
Happiness Report 2015 (Helliwell, Layard, and Sachs, eds., 2015, page 10 of Statistical Appendix).

high or low levels of life satisfaction being more likely to declare a desire to emigrate than those
reporting levels closer to the average. 2 Interestingly, the U-shaped relationship has also been
found among source countries, such that individuals from the least and most satisfied countries
are more likely to emigrate than those from countries with average levels of life satisfaction in
the middle of the distribution (Polgreen and Simpson, 2011).

Bartram (2011) suggested that economic migrants may self-select based on a higher ability to
derive subjective well-being benefits from income, finding that the effect of income on life
satisfaction for immigrants in the United States was significantly larger than for natives. The
overall strength of the effect of absolute income, however, remained small even for the
immigrants in Bartram’s (2011) analysis. And a subsequent comprehensive international analysis
of this phenomenon by Olgiati, Calvo, and Berkman (2013) failed to replicate this result in a
19-country sample from the Gallup World Poll, finding no significant difference in the effects of
income for immigrants or the foreign born, including in the United States.

Several studies in recent years have made use of panel data sets to study the well-being effects of
internal migration. Nowok, van Ham, Findlay, and Gayle (2013), using data on domestic
migration from the British Household Panel, found that life satisfaction did not increase in the
long run following a move, although moves were generally preceded by a substantial decrease in
life satisfaction during the years immediately prior. This result, however, was based on a sample
which included a large number of movers who had traveled very short distances, often less than
five kilometers. Moves were often also coincident with changes in life circumstances, both
positive and negative, such as marriage or separation. They did find, however, that the life
satisfaction of those who moved only once increased following the move. Subsequently, Switek
(2014) used data on inter-municipal migrants from the Swedish Young Adult Panel and found
that, after controlling for changes in life circumstances, individuals who moved due to work
experienced substantial and statistically significant increases in life satisfaction which persisted
over the six to ten subsequent years of observation. Life circumstances, and the resulting average
Although Ivlevs (2015) later attempts to show a monotonic increasing selection effect of life satisfaction on
the desire to emigrate, this second result hinges critically on the validity of an unusual instrument, having a
parent or grandparent who was injured or killed in the second world war, which would likely follow an
unusual age distribution and indeed interfered markedly with the coefficients on the age dummies in their
second-stage results.

life evaluation scores, differ ten times more among countries than within countries, even among
the states of the United States or the provinces of Canada. Hence the move from one country to
another is much more likely to involve changes in life circumstances large enough to trigger
significant changes in life evaluations. Large changes in life satisfaction, of several points on a
10- or 11-point scale, sustained over time would provide a more convincing argument against the
set point hypothesis.

Although panel data sets covering international migration are rarer still, results using these data
sets have largely agreed with cross-sectional results. In a panel of Ingrian-Finnish migrants from
Russia to Finland who were interviewed during Finnish language courses prior to their departure
and were followed for up to three years, stable and significant increases in life satisfaction were
recorded after migration (Lönnqvist et al., 2015). In a rare instance of a randomized trial,
Stillman et al. (2015) were able to observe potential migrants from Tonga to New Zealand who
were entered into an immigration lottery. Unfortunately, measures of global life satisfaction were
not captured, although several domain satisfactions were recorded, along with reports of general
happiness and mental health. Relative to the control group, those who migrated reported
decreased happiness, but improved mental health. Lastly, in the largest panel study of
international migration (to the extent that East and West Germany are considered separate
countries) and life satisfaction to date, Melzer (2011) found that migrants from East to West
Germany in the years after reunification experienced a permanent increase in life satisfaction
following their move. Although it was observed that, consistent with the Easterlin paradox
(Easterlin, 1974, 1995), the average life satisfaction of this group did not continue to rise with
their ever-increasing average income, Melzer (2011) interpreted this to be a result of their
relative incomes remaining low compared to those of West German natives.

Due in large part to data limitations, the studies listed above have tended to examine only a small
number of source-destination pairs. The exceptionally large sample sizes available through
Statistics Canada’s Canadian Community Health Surveys and General Social Surveys allowed
Frank et al. (2016) to analyze the average difference in life satisfaction among Canadian
immigrants from 43 different source countries. Remarkably, the differences between immigrants
and the native born tended to be small and not statistically significant. When immigrants’ life

7

satisfaction was compared to the satisfaction of those who remained in their source countries, the
gap was almost as large in each case as the gap between life satisfaction in Canada and in each of
the source countries, even where the source-country averages were far less than those in Canada.
Thus the difference in life circumstances appeared to explain almost the entire difference in the
international averages, even after controlling for socioeconomic and demographic factors that
might drive selection into immigration. It was seeing an early version of that research paper that
led us to expand the sample and use migration data more directly as a test bed for the set point
hypothesis.

Data and Methods
We first assemble comparable measures of subjective well-being for immigrants in Canada 3, and
for populations currently living in the source countries. Life evaluations in Canada and the
source countries provide the basis for our test of the set point hypothesis. This choice is driven
by several reasons.

First, we have comparable Canadian and source-country data for life evaluations, but not for
measures of positive or negative affect.

Second, international differences in life evaluations have been shown to be much larger than for
emotional reports, and hence more likely to be affected by migration. Of the global variations in
individual life evaluations in the years 2010-2012, more than 25% were across rather than within
nations, compared to less than 10% for positive affect and 7% for negative affect (Helliwell and
Wang, 2013, Figure 2.1).

Third, differences in life evaluations are more fully explained by differences in life
circumstances than are differences in positive and negative emotions. For example, the World
Happiness Report 2015 shows (in Table 2.1) that six variables reflecting key differences in life

3 Due to the nature of questions regarding citizenship and immigrant status on the surveys used for this
study, this sample includes, aside from immigrants (permanent residents of Canada), foreign-born temporary
residents in Canada, and some foreign-born Canadian citizens by birth. For ease of exposition, we use the
term “immigrant” throughout the paper to refer to this whole sample.

8

circumstances explain 74% of the differences in national average life evaluations, compared to
49% for the corresponding differences in positive affect and 22% for negative affect.

Thus we are expecting that life evaluations will provide the most appropriate means for showing
that subjective well-being can be permanently shifted by changes in life circumstances. But at
the same time we recognize and expect that the set point hypothesis might well be a larger part of
the story for some other measures of subjective well-being, including positive and negative
affect. Our available data, which only include life evaluations, do not permit us to test this
possibility.

We use two different sources for source-country life evaluations: life satisfaction answers (on a
scale from 1 to 10) from the World Values Survey (WVS), and responses to the Cantril ladder
question (on a scale from 0 to 10) from the Gallup World Poll (GWP).

The data for Canada are from two nationally representative household surveys: six waves of the
General Social Survey (GSS) (2008 to 2011, 2013 and 2014) and six waves of the Canadian
Community Health Survey (CCHS) (2009 to 2014). For the first stage of our study the data for
the populations in immigrants’ source countries are from Waves 3 to 5 of the WVS, conducted
between 1994 and 2008.

The countries chosen for the first part of our analysis are those with more than 50 immigrants to
Canada over the previous twenty years, and which have also been covered by the WVS.
Compared to the earlier analysis by Frank et al. (2016), we have been able, thanks to the
availability of several new survey rounds, to increase the robustness of the analysis by increasing
from 20 to 50 the number of Canadian immigrants required for a source country to be included.
The Frank et al. analysis covered 43 countries with more than 20 immigrants in the previous
10 years, and 58 with more than 20 immigrants in the previous 20 years. Our first-stage analysis
covers 56 countries with more than 50 immigrants in the preceding 20 years. In our later analysis
using the GWP to provide greater coverage of source-country data, we will be able to analyze
81 countries with more than 50 immigrants to Canada in the past 20 years, and 100 countries
with more than 50 immigrants in the past 40 years.

9

Table 1 provides an alphabetical list of all of the source countries appearing in either stage of
analysis, along with the numbers of immigrants to Canada (where that number equals or exceeds
50), for both the 20 and 40-year immigration spans, and also the sizes of the WVS samples in
each of the 56 first-stage source countries.

Our research methods are similar to those used by Frank et al. (2016). We compare average life
satisfaction levels of immigrants to Canada to those in the countries from which they have
emigrated. If the life satisfaction of all immigrants tends to approach that of other Canadians
despite the large differences in subjective well-being among the various source countries, this
would provide strong evidence that reported life satisfaction depends on the circumstances in the
countries in which they live, rather than on the genetic mix and cultures of the countries in which
they were born.

In the first stage of our analysis we shall test whether selection effects are likely to make the
Canadian immigrant sample unrepresentative of the source populations. We certainly expect
differences, especially in the case of immigrants coming under the Canadian immigration points
system, as the system attaches a high value to higher education, and to language skills in English
and French, with the result that the immigrant populations have university graduate proportions
even higher than those found among the Canadian-born. To see whether these selection effects
are likely to distort the average life satisfaction scores of the immigrant groups, we first pool the
source-country and immigrant data and estimate, following Frank et al. (2016), an equation
explaining individual satisfaction with life using a number of mainly demographic variables that
are likely to be correlated with life satisfaction and which may also take different values for
migrants and non-migrants in the source populations. The estimated equation is shown in
Table 2.

age_reg = age – 45), a gender dummy, a set of indicators of marital status (common-law,
widowed, divorced/separated, single, with married as the reference group), a set of indicators of
highest educational attainment (some post-secondary, high school, less than high school, with
university degree as the reference group), a set of indicators of labour force status (unemployed,
not in the labour force, with employed as the reference group), and self-assessed health status
(the middle of five categories was chosen as the reference group). 4 Finally, survey indicators 𝑆 𝐼𝑀
were included for the Canadian data sources since earlier research found systematic differences
in life satisfaction levels between the GSS and CCHS surveys, and across the GSS cycles
(Bonikowska et al., 2014). The estimated coefficients 𝛿𝑘 and 𝜆𝑘 represent the average

satisfaction with life among immigrants in Canada from a given source country and people living
in the source countries for a reference person. This is a 45-year-old married employed male
university graduate in the middle health category. The estimated coefficients can then be used to
predict the satisfaction with life (SWL) of anyone with differing characteristics.

The GWP also includes a series of questions on international migration intentions, which allow
us to check for signs of selection on unobservable characteristics. Each respondent in the GWP is
asked whether, given the opportunity, they would like to move permanently to another country.
Those who answer in the affirmative are also asked to name the country that they would most
like to move to in that event. Starting in 2010, respondents were also asked whether they
intended to move to that country within the next 12 months. While the large majority of
individuals reported that they would prefer not to emigrate, approximately one in five indicated
that they would do so given the chance. Of these, one in twenty (or approximately 1% of the
overall sample) reported that they would most like to move to Canada. Another one in ten of
these (approximately 0.1% of the overall sample) indicated an intention to move permanently to
Canada in the next 12 months.

Five categories of answers were available in both the Canadian surveys and the WVS. In Canada, the five
categories are labelled: excellent, very good, good, fair and poor. In the WVS the labels are: very good, good,
fair, poor and very poor. In several countries, no responses were recorded under “very poor”.

Figure 1 presents the average levels of subjective well-being, measured by the Cantril ladder, for
each of these groups by region. 5,6 Not surprisingly, those who would like to emigrate score
significantly lower than those who would prefer to stay. Even the highly selected sub-sample
who want to move to Canada in particular score either significantly lower than the rest of the
population, or no better. Meanwhile, as we move from left to right within each region of origin in
Figure 1 the samples are becoming more similar to the actual immigrants sampled in the CCHS
and GSS. In all regions the proportion of individuals aged 22 or over who have completed a fouryear university degree rises substantially, from approximately 10% globally, to 14.5% among
those willing to move in general, up to 22.5% for those who want to move to Canada. Although
recent immigrants in Canada are more likely still to have completed a university degree, even
restricting the analysis to those who have completed at least four years of post-secondary
education does not qualitatively change the results in Figure 1. Although potential emigrants to
Canada are better educated on average, they do not appear to be systematically happier than their
counterparts who would rather stay in the home country.

Return migration could also be a source of selection bias. Not everyone who immigrates to
Canada decides to stay, and the chronically dissatisfied may decide to return to their home
countries or emigrate elsewhere. Since we only observe those who haven’t left, this could skew
the distribution of life satisfaction within our sample of immigrants in Canada. Although exact
figures are not available, analysis based on census and tax records suggests that the return
migration rate for immigrants in Canada is on the order of 1% per year during the first ten years
after arrival (Aydemir and Robinson, 2006; Finnie, 2006). These data sets also imply a large
turnover in the first year, possibly as high as one in five. However, these high turnover rates are
based on comparisons between administrative data and landing records, and the extent to which
this result may be due to imperfect linkages between the two data sources has not been

For each region in Figure 1, the first three columns on the left use data from the GWP 2006 to 2015, while
the remaining two columns use data starting from 2010, when the 12-month emigration intentions questions
were added to the GWP, to 2015. Restricting the former to match the 2010-2015 collection period did not
qualitatively change the levels. As a result, the broader range was maintained for these columns in order to
increase precision.

established. 7 Similarly to these other data sets, our sample from the GSS and CCHS does not
directly show a sharp drop in the first year. Consequently, it is not clear to what extent these
ultra-short-term immigrants are captured in our sample. The return migration that takes place
during the subsequent two decades, however, is of a similar aggregate proportion, and any
effects of selection out on the basis of set points should be clearly visible in our Figure 2.

Figure 2 depicts the time path of mean life satisfaction reported by immigrants in our sample by
years since arrival. Under the low set point selection hypothesis, we should observe a steady
increase in average life satisfaction as those at the bottom of the distribution of set points select
out over time. Contrary to this, however, the time path of average life satisfaction is uniformly
trendless over the first 20 years. This picture is not inconsistent with results in Figure 1 in which
potential emigrants in North America and Europe tended to score significantly lower on the
Cantril ladder than those who would prefer to stay, so long as these differences are driven by
changing life circumstances, rather than low set points.

Figures 3 and 4 plot the average life satisfaction of immigrants from each of the 56 first-stage
countries against the WVS averages for the source countries. Each figure also shows a 45-degree
line on which the points would be expected to fall if the satisfaction with life (SWL) of the
migrants was unaffected by moving to Canada and if the migrants were randomly drawn from
the sampled source populations. 8 Figure 3 makes no adjustment for selection effects, effectively
assuming that the immigrants are a random sample of the source-country population. Figure 4
plots the adjusted (for differences in socio-demographic characteristics) values using the
equation of Table 2 (model 4) to estimate what the life satisfaction levels would be for someone
with the assumed baseline characteristics in both the source-country and immigrant samples.

Aydemir and Robinson (2006) note that 10-15% of immigrants never appear in their tax filing data.
Consequently, the first year hazard rate observed within the tax data itself is less than half as high as that
implied by the comparison to landing records.
8 Another requirement for the points to fall on the 45-degree line is that the survey content does not differ
substantially between the WVS and the Canadian surveys used in this study. The WVS was conducted in
Canada in 2000 and again in 2006. In both years, the average measured SWL for Canada was approximately
7.8, about 0.2 points lower than the estimate obtained from the pooled GSS and CCHS samples (and
controlling for survey and survey cycle), a difference far smaller than most gaps in average SWL between
immigrants and their source-country populations.

What is remarkable about the comparison between the two figures is how similar they are.
Although it is indeed true that immigrants to Canada from some countries differ considerably,
especially in age and education, from typical residents of their source-country population,
adjusting for the effects these differences make to predicted SWL makes little difference either to
the country rankings or to the slope of the plot of immigrant SWL relative to source-country
SWL. The near-flatness of the distribution provides strong counter-evidence to the set point
hypothesis, since that hypothesis requires that the immigrant SWL observations would instead lie
along the 45-degree line. This should especially be the case for Figure 4, which adjusts for likely
selection effects, at least to the extent that they are captured by the main demographic variables.
Instead, in both figures the average immigrant life satisfaction is very close to that of other
Canadians, whether the comparison is based on simple averages, as in Figure 3, or using scores
adjusted for differences in characteristics of the immigrants and the source-country populations.

Figure 5 shows the extent of well-being convergence in a different way, for the same 56-country
sample shown in Figures 3 and 4. The first three bars show the cross-country averages for the
measured, predicted (using Equation 2) and adjusted SWL, respectively. The vertical lines for
the confidence regions show that the three averages are within the same confidence region. The
fourth and fifth bars show the averages for the immigrants to Canada from those same 56
countries. The fourth bar shows the average of immigrants who have been in Canada for 0 to 20
years, while the fifth bar shows the average for those in Canada from 0 to 40 years. The two
averages are essentially identical, and the tight confidence intervals of the estimates show how
great the convergence has been. In both cases average immigrant SWL is more than a full point,
on the 10-point scale, above that in the source countries, with the average gains being much
greater for those coming from countries with lower average SWL, showing once again the
permanent effects of differences in life circumstances. Where the improvement in life
circumstances has been greatest, as measured, for example, by the six key variables used in
Helliwell, Huang and Wang (2015, Table 2.1) to account for differences among countries in life
evaluations, then so has been the increase in the average life evaluations of the immigrants.

Because the adjustment for selection effects makes so little difference to the results, we were
able to turn with more confidence to consider a larger set of countries for which the GWP

14

provided data, with the average sample sizes also being larger. Figure 6 shows the data for the 81
countries that have more than 50 immigrants, in the survey samples, who have arrived in Canada
in the last 20 years, while Figure 7 shows the relation for immigrants from the 100 countries with
more than 50 sampled immigrants who have arrived in the previous 40 years. The numbers of
sampled immigrants shown in Table 1 provide a good idea of the relative importance of different
source countries, and how this importance has changed over the past 40 years.

The use of the GWP data to measure the SWL of the source countries poses an additional
complication. The GWP asked the satisfaction with life question, on the same 0 to 10 scale used
in the recent Canadian surveys, during only one year. In all years the main life evaluation
question used is the one known as the Cantril ladder, which asks respondents to think of their
lives as a ladder, with the best possible life for them as a 10, and the worst as a zero, and then to
use this scale to rate their own current lives. It was very valuable to have at least one year in
which both questions were asked, as this enabled some key results to be discovered. One is that
while the distributions of the answers to the two questions differed, when asked of the same
respondents, the answers were explained by the same underlying factors, with very similar
coefficients, so much so that the overall equation obtained a better fit if the two answers were
averaged (Helliwell et al., 2010). Second, we are able to model the differences between the
means of the two distributions so as to be able to convert the average ladder scores to a predicted
average life satisfaction score for each country. Looking across countries, the life satisfaction
scores are on average higher than those for the Cantril ladder, especially for those countries with
higher average ladder scores, as shown by the following equation:
� = −0.37 + 1.16 ∗ 𝐶𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑙 𝑙𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑒𝑟
𝑆𝑊𝐿

(2)

Figures 3, 4, 6 and 7 all show a clear convergence pattern that seems to apply to all source
countries. Immigrants from Latin America show as having higher life satisfaction than those
from other regions, while those from East Asia are less so. This parallels a similar finding from
the global modeling of life evaluations, in which a common model shows positive residuals in
Latin America and negative ones in East Asia (Helliwell, Huang, and Wang, 2015, p. 29).

15

Figure 8 shows the extent of well-being convergence in a different way for the largest
100-country sample shown in Figure 7. There are three bars in Figure 8, each with a vertical line
showing the 95% confidence range for the estimates. The first bar shows the average Cantrilladder life evaluation in the 100 source countries, while the second shows the average estimated
SWL measures in the same 100 countries, where each country’s average is computed using
Equation 2, reflecting the fact that, although SWL and the Gallup ladder are determined by the
same factors, SWL increases more than does the Gallup ladder as subjective well-being
increases. It is the data shown in the second bar that are plotted in Figure 7 against the average
SWL of immigrants to Canada from those same countries. The right-hand bar of Figure 8 shows
the average SWL of immigrants from the 100 countries, while the short vertical error bar
provides an estimate of the 95% confidence region for the average. Two things are immediately
apparent when bars 2 and 3 of Figure 8 are compared. First is that the average SWL of the
immigrants is far higher than that of the residents of the source countries. Second, and perhaps
even more telling as evidence against the set point, is how great the extent of convergence is.
The tight confidence region in the right-hand bar is another way of documenting the flatness
already apparent in Figure 7.
Finally, the panels of Figure 9 compare, for each of nine source regions for immigrants to
Canada, the distribution of SWL answers of immigrants compared to the distribution of sourcecountry SWL in the WVS in those same regions. Once again, the effects of convergence are
apparent. Although there are marked differences in the shapes, and not just the averages, of the
distributions of SWL in the source regions, the distribution shapes for the migrants are
remarkably similar across Canadian immigrant groups. All immigrants are not equally satisfied
with their lives, but the shape of the distribution tends to mimic that of other Canadians over the
same period of time, as shown in Figure 10, rather than that in the global regions in which they
were born. We reject the null hypothesis of equality of distributions of satisfaction with life
among immigrants in Canada and distributions in their source regions at conventional
significance levels using the Epps-Singleton test. 9 Because of the large sample sizes, we also
reject the null hypothesis of equality of distributions in most pair-wise tests comparing
We use the Epps-Singleton test (Epps and Singleton, 1986) rather than the more common KolmogorovSmirnov test because the latter requires that the distributions tested be continuous, whereas the former
allows both continuous and discrete distributions, with the life satisfaction evaluations being of the latter
type (Goerg and Kaiser, 2009).

immigrants from different regions to one another, and to the Canadian-born. However, the life
satisfaction evaluations among immigrants, unlike in most source regions examined, but
similarly to the Canadian-born, are concentrated at values 7 and higher, with fewer than 10%
reporting values of 5 or 6, and almost no reported evaluations lower than 5. For immigrants from
all regions, the average gap between their life satisfaction and the average in their source
populations is several times greater than between them and those born in Canada. The same is
true for the inequality of life satisfaction, as measured by the standard deviation of life
evaluations within each group.
Discussion
The flatness of the distributions in Figures 3, 4, 6 and 7 shows not just that immigrants to Canada
are happier on average than those in their countries of birth, but that the improvement is much
larger for those who immigrated from countries with lower average life satisfaction. Since
international differences in average life evaluations are well-explained by differences in life
circumstances, this implies that immigrants from the lower SWL countries have had bigger
changes in their life circumstances, thus giving rise to greater migration-induced improvements
in their life satisfaction.

The fact that immigrants have quite different gains or losses in average SWL, coupled with the
evidence that the international differences in source-country SWL are largely explained by the
same life circumstances and living conditions and social contexts that explain within-country
differences in SWL, provides strong evidence that large changes in life circumstances are
causing large permanent changes in life evaluations.

Although the distributions are flat, there is still a small but significant footprint effect, with those
coming from lower SWL countries having a residual effect reflecting the circumstances into
which they were born. This is consistent with the previously established footprint effects for
some social norms, including trust and generosity, which help to support SWL at the individual
and national levels.

Note 1: Regressions were run with no constant. If instead they had been run with one country-intercept
omitted, the R-squared would have been as reported in the table.
Note2: Weighting in regressions used to adjust for selection effects:
In years where both GSS and CCHS data are available, sample weights are divided by 2, so that those two
surveys combined represent the Canadian population in that year. Furthermore, sample weights for
immigrants from a given source country were adjusted so that they sum to the sample size of immigrants
from that country. WVS sample weights were adjusted so that the sum of weights for a given source country
equals to the size of the corresponding immigrant sample.
