Tariffs, Employment and the Current Account:
Real Wage Resistance and the Macroeconomics of Protectionism

ABSTRACT

Using a standard complete specialization model of a small open

economy within a rigorous intertemporal optimization framework with contract—
based wage rigidity, we show that permanent tariffs may lead to a current
account deterioration and a fall in employment, contradicting most of the

literature of macro—economic effects of import tariffs. I show that this will
always be the case if the economy is small enough. The crucial factor in this
complete reversal of standard results is the impact of tariffs on domestic

real product wages via wage indexation. Temporary tariffs will have less of a
negative impact on the CA or potentially even a positive impact, because they
increase the consumption rate of interest (the ternis at which future

consumption can be traded for current consumption) and so increase private
savings.

Extensions towards incorporating a more general production structure,
investment and the use of tariff revenues to provide wage subsidies are
presented.

1. Introduction
The continued persistence of the post 1973 slowdown in world—wide
economic growth has led to increasing pressure in many countries to maintain
growth while preserving external balance by using commercial policy to protect

domestic production. Much of the existing literature on macro—economic
effects of tariffs seems to lend support to that approach (at least under a

fixed exchange rate regime). For a recent exposition, see Dornbusch (1980) or
Chalciolades (1978) who provide further references going all the way back to

Metzler (1949). See furthermore, Johnson (1958), Mussa (1974a) or Boyer

(1977). The argument is straightforward: higher tariffs (with revenues
rebated to consumers) have a pure substitution effect leading to a higher
demand for domestic goods which in turn leads to higher output, income and

therefore savings. Higher savings imply a current account improvement. Under
flexible exchange rates an appreciating currency may offset these effects (see

Mundell (1961) and Boyer (1977)).
I will argue that implausible assumptions on wage behavior are

crucial to those results. Output will only go up if the increase in tariffs
succeeds in lowering the real product wage. Since the macro—economic
literature on tariffs usually assumed fixed nominal wages when discussing

employment effects, the results follow automatically if the tariff increase
succeeds in shifting domestic demand towards our goods.
One problem with all this has to do with foreign retaliation.

Another problem arises because of the issue of real wage resistance. Often
real wage indexation is at the root of internal/external balance conflicts.
It is not clear why commercial policy would succeed in lowering the real wage

where other attempts have failed. It then becomes of interest to explore the

SV—039/SVD/04—17—87

2

consequences of commercial policy when wage indexation is effective. I will
focus on tariffs in this paper.

A further problem with the macroeconomic literature on tariff policy
is that its conclusions on CA effects are based on models incorporating
arbitrary static savings functions, not a very meaningful procedure in an
analysis of a clearly intertemporal issue such as current account behavior.
An elegant exception is the note by Razin and Svensson (1983) who however
assume market clearing real wages and, in another departure from the standard
Mundell framework, exogenous terms of trade.
In what follows we will stick to the Mundell framework but introduce
contract based real wage rigidity and savings behavior derived from explicit

forward looking maximizing behavior. Section 2 derives the main results of
this paper in a two—period framework (the minimum needed to get a time

structure in). We assume contract—based real (consumption) wage rigidity in
response to unanticipated shocks. No second period shocks unanticipated at
the beginning of period two will be considered, so that period will be

characterized by full employment. In Section 3, I briefly discuss to what
extent the results depend on the special assumptions made. In particular,
introduction of aggregate investment and extension to incomplete

specialization are discussed. Section 4 discusses the possibility of using
some or all of the tariff revenues for wage subsidies to get around the wage

rigidity problem. Section 5 concludes.

Tariffs, Employment and the Current Account

2.1 The Model
Consider a two country Mundell—Fleming framework where each country

produces only one good. We make two alternative assumptions about output: in

SV—039/SVD/ 04—17—87

3

the No Wage Indexation (NWI) case, output is always at its full employment
level; in the Wage Indexation (WI) case, unemployment may result if wage
indexation prevents real product wages to fall to their market clearing level.
We assume utility 11 to be weakly homothetically separable in

consumption today and consumption tomorrow while the period by period
subutility indices are homothetic and identical in terms of functional form
and parameter values (the arguments may of course differ across periods).
This allows us to define unit utility expenditure functions
and 112 which can be interpreted as aggregate price indices, and an
expenditure function:

(1)

where

E =

so that C. =

aE/p.

Wage indexation is introduced in a simple manner: wage contracts are
negotiated at the beginning of each period, incorporating all information

available at that time. They are set at a level that will lead to full
employment if no unanticipated shocks occur during the contract period, and
are indexed on the CPI (iIi).

Since we will not consider any shocks or policy

changes in the second period that are unanticipated at the beginning of that

4

SV—039/SVD/04—17—87

second period, full employment will obtain in that period. Accordingly the
goods market clearing equation for period 2 is:

with X2 being the full employment output level. Of course first period

We will for simplicity set the initial tariff at zero. This is, however, of

(3) indicates that, in this Mundell—Fleming context, tariffs will push up the

real (domestic) product wage if the Metzler paradox does not obtain, i.e. if
the tariff inclusive price of the foreign good indeed goes up in terms of the

domestic good. We will assume that foreign demand elasticities are high
enough to rule out the Metzler paradox.
Now that first period wages do not necessarily clear the labor
market, period 1. output will not necessarily be at its full employment

level. Capital in period 1 is inherited from the past, there are no

Under wage indexation, output and employment follow from the wage

as listed in (4a, b).
In the full employment version of the model, wages clear the labour

country.

We will make one important simplifying assumption: we will assume
that the relative price of foreign goods tomorrow in terms of foreign goods

is

today (6) ,

fixed, allowing Hicks—aggregation of current and future foreign

goods. The market clearing equation for that Hicks—aggregate good is

redundant because of Walras' law. A true two—country model would of course
endogenize 6 (or, equivalently, the world rate of interest), leading to two
separate market clearing equations for foreign goods, one for period one and

the other for period two, only one of which would be redundant. The benefits

of extra generality that endogenizing 6 would yield do not seem to justify
the additional complexity it would also lead to, at least for the particular
issue we are looking at now (Appendix B does, however, provide an outline of
such a generalization).

2.2 Results
One result is immediate: if the Metzler paradox does not obtain,
higher tariffs will lead to real wage pressure in the domestic goods sector.

Equation (3) says that nominal wage changes equal a weighted average of tariff
changes and domestic price changes; ruling out the Metzler paradox implies
that

and firstperiod output go down after an increase in the tariff rate
(equations (3 & 4)). Tariff increases would lower the real wage "ex ante";
real wage indexation will, to prevent that, lead to an increase in the real
domestic product wage and therefore to unemployment (qualifications to that
result due to relaxing the Mundell—Fleming complete specialization assumption
are discussed in the next section).

This is intuitive: with wage

indexation, aggregate supply of first period home goods falls, hence a larger
relative price increase is necessary to restore goods market equilibrium.
Since we have ignored investment so far, current account effects of

tariffs can be derived by looking at private savings. To avoid uninteresting
ambiguities, we will make a symmetry assumption on flow variables across

periods: corresponding flow variables across periods (say, exports today and
exports tomorrow) are assumed equal per unit of time in both periods before

the changes in tariffs. This of course implies that their actual values may
differ since the periods may correspond to time spans of very different
length.

favorable income effects of tariff induced terms of trade changes (the gains
of which will be spread out over both periods) and because they lead to an
increase in the consumption rate of interest favorably affecting private

savings. It should be stressed that the CA improvement stems from the fact
that the tariff is temporary.

The fourth term, (D), may reverse this result, since X1 < 0.

The

intuition is clear: higher tariffs cause first period unemployment and hence
low first period income in the presence of real consumption wage indexation.

Standard income smoothing arguments explain that this has a negative impact on
the first period current account.

An expression similar to (14) can be derived for future temporary

tariff increases (df2 >

0).

It is straightforward to show that with the

assumptions made so far, future tariff increases will lead to a period 1

current account deficit. The story is similar: income effects via favorable
terms of trade changes come in the future but are partially spent today, and
the real consumption rate of interest falls.

Taking the two results together to analyze a permanent increase in

tariffs df1 =

we get that in the absence of real wage indexation a

while income effects are the same in both periods. Accordingly a permanent

of elasticity conditions that are usually claimed to be sufficient to
guarantee such an improvement (c.f. Dornbusch (1980)):

(15a)

The reason for this is quite straightforward: a tariff changes

relative prices within the period in which it is levied, but a permanent
tariff does that both today and tomorrow, leaving the relative price of
consumption today in terms of consumption tomorrow (one plus the consumption

rate of interest) unaffected. Accordingly, savings will not change, which
explains the absence of a current account impact. The extension to endogenous
investment is discussed in Section 4.

All these results are considerably modified however if real wage
resistance to the tariff induced increase in the cost of living is

introduced. Ignoring second round effects of real wage changes on the terms
of trade and via that on the consumption rate of interest and thus on saving
gives:

effects will improve the CA, so, although the possibility of a negative CA
response is now there, it does not follow unambiguously.

A substantially stronger result can be obtained if we look at the
limiting case of a small country (fixed terms of trade exclusive of tariffs in

both periods). Then the only CA impact of a permanent increase in tariffs
will come via the fall in income induced by real wage pressure:

or a permanent increase in tariffs in a completely specialized price taker

For a temporary tariff there is the offsetting effect of the direct
impact of the first period tariff on the real discount factor; but we can
still show that even if a CA surplus results it will be smaller than without

3. Some Qualifications
We will briefly discuss the consequences of relaxing the complete
specialization assumption and of introducing investment.

Incomplete specialization plays no role in the full employment —— NWI
case: all the conclusions will carry through although one expects smaller

relative price movements since these now also trigger resource shifts. The
case with wage indexation, WI, needs more qualifications. If both capital and
labour are mobile between sectors, Stolper—Samuelson tells us that market
clearing wages will fall or rise in terms of both goods (and therefore in
terms of the consumption price index

depending on whether the tariff is

levied on the capital or labour intensive good. Real wage indexation will
lead to results similar to those obtained in Section 3 if the tariff is levied
on the capital intensive good since the indexation scheme will prevent the
downward adjustment in real wages necessary to maintain full employment.

The conditions under which unemployment will arise in response to
tariffs in a Ricardo—Viner sector—specific capital, mobile labor model with
real wage indexation are more complicated and will also involve consumption

16

SV—039/SVD/04--17—87

shares. Consider the small country case (p1= 0). We can use the results in
Mussa (1974b) to derive the condition under which a full employment
equilibrium would be characterized by a lower real consumpion wage after the
imposition of an import tariff:

This is more likely if the import competing sector

employed only a small fraction of the labor force (Af small) or if that
sector has a comparatively low labor demand elasticity because of either
relatively low factor substitutability (cf/aD small) or because of a

relatively high capital share ((1_Of)/(l_OD) large).
Consider now investment, while reverting to our Mundell—Fleming

context of complete specialization. The natural approach complementing our
optimizing savings behavior is to derive investment from a similar optimizing
procedure:

bigger ones tomorrow and an increase in the real discount factor (decrease in
consumption rate of interest), all of which lead to a deterioration of the CA:

4. Wage Subsidies Financed by Tariff Revenues
At the root of the problems discussed in Section 3 is the fact that
real wage indexatjon leads to an increase in the real domestic—product wage

after an increase in tariffs. A natural response is to use the tariff
revenues to drive a wedge between real product wages and real consumption

wages via wage subsidies: this would allow the real consumption wage to
remain constant without an increase in the real product wage.

In what follows we take a slightly different approach: part of the
tariff revenues is used to keep the utility of wage earners constant. 1/ A

related analysis can be found in Dixit and Norman (1980); there however one of
the two factors of production receives all tariff revenues, while we give wage
earners only as much as is needed to keep their utility constant.

Consider a simplified one period version of the model of Section 2.
We now have to distinguish the incomes accruing to the two factors of

production in the home economy. Denote the expenditure function of domestic

wage earners as e and of capitalists as

.

Similarly u and i

represent utility of wage earners and capitalists respectively. Accordingly,
tariff revenues equal T =

t(ef

+

ef).

A fraction X of T is handed out to

wage earners. A is determined endogenously in such a way that u will not
be affected by the change in tariffs.
The budget constraint of workers is:

(24a)

e(p,f,u) = w +

Xt(ef+

ef).

1/ This approach was suggested by Avinash Dixit.

Similarly, capitalists face the constraint

(24b)

(p,f,) =

pX

— w + (1—X)
t(ef+ ef).

The foreign budget constraint is

E (p,l,U ) = X

A will be set in such a way that u =

u,

allowing the real product wage

u = w/p to remain at its full employment level. 1/ Clearly, domestic output
will not be affected under this set up. Simple differentiation of 24a,b,c
around the zero tariff equilibrium yields:

So an increase in tariffs is good because you get reimbursed for outlays you

did not make (Af for wage earners and (l—A)ef for capitalists) and bad
because you are only incompletely reimbursed for costs you do incur

(—(l—A)ef for wage earners and —A for capitalists). If

Accordingly in

the case of normal tariff incidence a positive share smaller than one will
suffice to maintain workers utility at the pre—tariff level.

What will happen to capitalists welfare? We can define A

So using part of the tariff revenues to finance wage subsidies does

provide a way around the problems of Section 3. Extension to two periods is
straightforward and will show a positive CA response. Before jumping to
conclusions however, a cautionary note is in order. Affecting the current
account calls for intervention to change the terms of trade between goods

today and goods tomorrow (the real interest rate). Achieving this end by also
introducing within period relative price distortions such as a temporary
tariff is clearly suboptimal under the assumption made.

5. Conclusions
The main purpose of this paper is to show that the traditional
analysis of current account and employment effects of tariffs in the "open
economy model" literature is very sensitive to arbitrary assumptions

habitually made about wage and savings behavior. Section 2 analysed the
current account response to temporary and permanent tariffs under savings
behavior derived from intertemporal. optimization rather than arbitrary

consumption functions; wages follow a contract theory type real wage

indexation rule. We kept the structure of the Mundell—Fleming model
traditionally used in macro—oriented discussions of tariffs to facilitate
comparison with that literature.
In the case of labour market clearing real wages a permanent increase

in tariffs is shown to leave the current account unaffected under reasonable
symmetry assumptions, since the income effects caused by tariffs induced terms

SV—039/SVD/04--17—87

23

of trade changes are the same (per unit of time) in both periods and the

consumption rate of interest does not change. A temporary tariff increase
"today" however leads to a stronger term of trade induced income effect today
than tomorrow; moreover, the current period apreciation caused by a temporary
tariff is larger than the second period terms of trade improvement, leading to

an increase in the consumption rate of interest. Both factors lead to a CA
improvement as a consequence of temporary first period tariffs.

Real wage indexation is shown to potentially modify these results.
In the Mundell—Fleining context of complete specialization, tariffs are shown

to increase the domestic real product wage if wages are indexed on the CPI.
This in turn implies that an increase in tariffs, if unanticipated at the time
first period wage contracts were concluded, will inevitably lead to
unemployment via the resulting upward pressure on the real domestic product

wage. This holds for both temporary and permanent increases in tariffs. As a
consequence first period output and therefore income declines, contributing a

negative element to the current account response. In the limiting case of an
infinite foreign demand elasticity (small country assumption) this negative

element is shown to dominate: in that case a permanent increase in tariffs
will lead to more unemployment, a fall in first period real output and a
current account deficit.

Temporary first period increases in tariffs will under real wage
indexation also lead to more unemployment and less first period real output,

but the increase in the real consumption rate of interest they also cause may
(or may not) offset the negative effect on the current account of the fall in

first period income associated with the increase in unemployment. Even if the
CA response is positive it will always be less than the corresponding CA
response to temporary tariffs without real wage indexation.

Endogenizing the World Interest Rate

Endogenizing the world interest rate r (or, equivalently, the world

discount factor 6) is straightforward. We will provide only a sketch of the
results one should expect; a full discussion of the interaction between
commercial policy and world interest rates can be found in van Wijnbergen
(1986).

If current and future goods are imperfect substitutes, we need to
incorporate one of the two commodity market clearing conditions for foreign

goods. We choose the one for current (as opposed to future) foreign goods:

Manipulation of B.1, budget constraints and the first period home goods
equilibrium equation yields an equivalent condition that the first period
world current account has to equal zero: 1/

A straightforward result follows from (15a). If a permanent tariff
changes p1 as much as it changes p2, it will leave both CA1 and CA1

unaffected for given world interest rates. But then, if B.2 held before the
change in commercial policy, it will also hold after the change in commercial

policy. Hence, in that case, the world interest rate will be unaffected.
A second simple result emerges in the case where current domestic and
foreign goods are close substitutes, so that the tariff change does not affect

the terms of trade very much. Equation (18) shows an ex ante CA decline for

Private budget constraints at home an abroad guarantee that, if B.2
holds, the world CA will also equal zero in period two.

given world interest rates in that case; to restore equilibrium in world
capital markets (so that B.2 holds again), the world interest rate needs to

rise. Unbalanced initial CA (and offsetting CA*) positions will add income
effects in a predictable manner.
