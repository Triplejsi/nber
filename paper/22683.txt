Occupational Choice in Early Industrializing Societies: Experimental Evidence on the Income
and Health Effects of Industrial and Entrepreneurial Work

NBER Working Paper No. 22683

ABSTRACT
As low-income countries industrialize, workers choose between informal self-employment and
low-skill manufacturing. What do workers trade off, and what are the long run impacts of this
occupational choice? Self-employment is thought to be volatile and risky, but to provide
autonomy and flexibility. Industrial firms are criticized for poor wages and working conditions,
but they could offer steady hours among other advantages. We worked with five Ethiopian
industrial firms to randomize entry-level applicants to one of three treatment arms: an industrial
job offer; a control group; or an “entrepreneurship” program of $300 plus business training. We
followed the sample over a year. Industrial jobs offered more hours than the control group’s
informal opportunities, but had little impact on incomes due to lower wages. Most applicants quit
the sector quickly, finding industrial jobs unpleasant and risky. Indeed, serious health problems
rose one percentage point for every month of industrial work. Applicants seem to understand the
risks, but took the industrial work temporarily while searching for better work. Meanwhile, the
entrepreneurship program stimulated self-employment, raised earnings by 33%, provided steady
work hours, and halved the likelihood of taking an industrial job in future. Overall, when the
barriers to self-employment were relieved, applicants appear to have preferred entrepreneurial to
industrial labor.

Introduction

Most of the world’s poor work informally for themselves or others. A wave of “entrepreneurship”, “social protection”, and other anti-poverty programs have tried to increase poor people’s incomes by giving them cash, livestock, skills, and other inputs into self employment.
Broadly speaking, evaluations of these programs suggest that these inputs relieve binding
constraints and help a wide array of people, from the very poorest to small business owners,
expand informal self-employment and raise their earnings.1
The larger process of development and structural change happening in many countries,
however, means that a great deal of future employment growth will be in the formal sector
with large firms. In recent years, for example, the world’s least developed countries have
experienced high growth in low-skill, labor-intensive industries such as agroindustry, textiles and apparel. Governments and development organizations generally see large-scale job
creation as one of the chief advantages of such low-skill industrialization (UNIDO, 2013).
In the long run, rising industrial demand for labor should increase wages and improve
working conditions across the economy, but at the early stages of industrialization (before
firms face tighter labor supply and must compete for qualified workers) it is unclear what
opportunities and risks industrial jobs offer to workers relative to their informal opportunities. This raises the broad question: How pro-poor are industrial jobs, and how do they
compare to so-called “entrepreneurial” self-employment?
This paper uses a case study and small-scale experiment in Ethiopia to investigate a set
of questions: What are the relative qualities of informal and industrial work at this early
stage of industrialization? Are there benefits or risks to the choice of one occupation over
the other? And how does the quality of self-employment options affect this occupational
choice? Workers may not understand many of these occupational tradeoffs, especially in a
relatively new sector. The limited literature offers ambiguous predictions.
On the one hand, industrial work could offer steady employment, valuable training and
experience, and in some cases wage premiums.2 Even some opponents concede the point:
a Scholars Against Sweatshop Labor statement (2001) admits that “after allowing for the

Blattman and Ralston, 2015; Banerjee et al., 2015.
2
There are several reasons why industrial work would pay a wage premium compared to informal work.
Firms may pay efficiency wages (Katz et al., 1989; Akerlof and Yellen, 1986) or there may also be institutional
and legislative sources, such minimum wages, labor codes or union bargaining (Card, 1996). If so, the result
is a dual or segmented labor market, in which those gaining industrial jobs earn rents while informal workers
queue for those jobs (e.g. Lewis, 1954; Harris and Todaro, 1970; Fields, 1975). Empirically, a large body
of observational evidence suggests that formal firms pay premium wages, especially large, foreign-owned, or
exporting firms. For Mexico see Bernard et al. (2010); Verhoogen (2008) and for Africa see Söderbom and
Teal (2004); El Badaoui et al. (2008).

frequent low wages and poor working conditions in these jobs, they are still generally superior to ’informal’ employment in, for example, much of agriculture or urban street vending.”
This reflects a common view that informal entrepreneurship is inefficient, risky, and relatively unprofitable, especially the petty trading that is so commonplace. Some evidence
also suggests that industrial jobs could have important social impacts, such as empowering
young women or enhancing the health of their children.3 As the economist Joan Robinson
remarked, “The misery of being exploited by capitalists is nothing compared to the misery
of not being exploited at all” (1962, p.45).
On the other hand, industrial jobs could entail difficult-to-foresee costs and risks. One
concern is that workers could make poorly informed or present-biased decisions that sacrifice
health or schooling, reducing long-run earnings potential. Looking at the rise of Mexican
maquiladoras, for instance, Atkin (2012) observed that as firms and wage opportunities grew,
young adults dropped out of high school to take the job, sacrificing a large amount of longrun earnings—a sacrifice inconsistent with even fairly high discount rates. Industrial firms
may also pose health risks that neither the firm nor worker fully understands, especially
when the sector or technology is relatively new.
To investigate the relative risks and benefits of industrial and informal work, we follow a
panel of nearly 1000 applicants to entry-level jobs in five industrial firms in different parts
of Ethiopia. They were self-selected to have at least some interest in an industrial job, and
screened by firms to have some secondary schooling. We randomly assigned roughly a third
of the applicants to a job offer, a third to a control group, and a third to an entrepreneurship
program intended to relieve key constraints on their informal employment opportunities: five
days of business training and planning followed by $300 grant (about $1030 in purchasing
power parity, or PPP).4 This paper reports results over the first year of the study.
Ethiopia is a growing export hub in horticulture, textiles, and leather products, and
although the economy is moving in fits and starts through the early stages of of industrialization, Ethiopia has been touted as one of “China’s successors” in garment manufacturing
(e.g. NPR, 2014). We approached hundreds of firms about the experiment. A majority
were willing to participate in the study, but only a handful were eligible in the sense of
hiring dozens of low-skilled workers at one time, due to, for example,the opening of a new
manufacturing line. In the end we worked with cohorts of applicants in five firms: a water bottling plant, a vegetable farm, a flower farm, a shoe manufacturer, and a textile and
garment factory.
3

Kabeer (2002) and Hewett and Amin (2000) provide evidence that working in textiles factories is associated with higher female status and quality of life. Atkin (2009) finds that Mexican women in export
manufacturing increase their incomes, have more household bargaining power, and have taller children.
4
This conversion is based on 2011 International Comparison Program data from the World Bank.

2

The people applying to these low-skill, entry-level jobs were generally unemployed but
educated young adults, mainly women, who lived nearby the firms. Most had had no work
in at least a month, and outside the factories most local work opportunities were informal:
casual labor, home enterprises, or agricultural work.
The comparison between the job offer and control arms indicates how the industrial job
compares to the workers’ typical alternatives. The entrepreneurship arm, meanwhile, was
designed to allow us to compare industrial work to the income trajectory, health, and other
dimensions of greater informal employment rather than unemployment.5 Our reasoning was
based on growing evidence that poor, young, credit-constrained adults may be able start or
expand a profitable microenterprise with capital and some basic advice.6 The point is not
to juxtapose a grant against a job (since a grant is unlikely to be a worker’s counterfactual)
but rather simulate self-employment opportunities under fewer constraints.
There are obvious limits to what we can learn from five firms in one country. The same
is true of any impact evaluation, where one program is usually evaluated in one setting.
Studies comparing formal to informal workers typically use country-wide surveys of firms
and workers. These country-wide studies have the advantage of comparing informal workers
to formal workers across a great many more firms, but these comparisons typically rest on
the assumption that informal and formal workers are similar after accounting for a handful
of demographic characteristics. These studies also typically have data on only a narrow set
of outcomes, such as earnings. Hence the health and other non-pecuniary consequences of
different occupations is not known.
What this case study and experiment offers, besides a randomized design, is the opportunity to measure a range of outcomes over time, including physical and mental health. Of
course we need to be cautious about generalizing from five firms. At best our results speak
to low-skill light manufacturing and agribusiness, in contexts where workers are essentially
disposable from the perspective of firms. This is a common feature of light manufacturing
and agribusiness in Ethiopia, and indeed we discuss how our results are consistent with patterns in more representative panels of young, unskilled Ethiopian workers and job searchers,
plus (to some extent) early and middle industrialization in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.
Beforehand, we expected the offer of an industrial job not only to end a potentially lengthy
unemployment spell, but also increase the probability these young people took permanent
5

Industry could have broader impacts that this design will not capture, such incentives for prospective
employees to gain education. Heath and Mobarak (2014) show that growth in the Bangladeshi textile
industry increases girls’ age at marriage and educational attainment.
6
Growing evidence suggests that the average poor person has high returns to capital but is creditconstrained, and injections of cash or capital increases hours worked and earnings in self-employment (Udry
and Anagol, 2006; de Mel et al., 2008; Haushofer and Shapiro, 2013; Blattman et al., 2014, 2015). Cash
transfers can also relieve the risk that someone takes an unwanted or unsafe job to cope with shocks.

3

employment in the industrial sector. We also expected that unsuccessful applicants could
still get work in industry, of course, but to the extent these jobs were scarce, or to the
extent other informal opportunities could arise before the next industrial job opportunity,
we expected the randomized job offer to shift people’s employment trajectories.7 Since the
sample self-selected into applying for industrial work, moreover, it was not clear that they
were natural entrepreneurs and would start businesses, even with a grant.
Instead, over the following year, the results painted a different picture: one where these
young people used low-skill industrial jobs more as a safety net than a long-term job, and
where self-employment and informal work were typically preferred to, and more profitable
than, industrial jobs, at least when people had access to capital. More worryingly, this
industrial safety net seems to have come with serious health risks. Even short spells in
industry resulted in significant increases in serious health problems a year later.
Some of these insights come from post-treatment qualitative observation and analysis of
the cross-sectional and panel data. First, we see no evidence of an industrial wage premium
in these five firms. A simple (non-experimental) wage comparison adjusting for baseline
characteristics suggests that industrial jobs seemed to pay almost a quarter lower wages
than informal opportunities.
Second, industrial work was associated with more stable employment hours, though only
modestly. Whereas the sample had an average of 7.5 hours of work a week in the month
before baseline, most were able to find full-time informal work by the time of the endline.
Informal work also tended to pay higher wages than the industrial forms, but it typically
came with the risk of short unemployment spells. Thus, while earnings from industrial work
were less volatile over short periods, such as a week, earnings in the industrial sector were
not necessarily more stable over the horizon of a month or a year.
Third, turnover in the industrial jobs was extremely high, in part because higher-wage
informal opportunities arose over time. Almost a third of people offered a job quit the study
firm in the first month, and 77% had quit within the year. People generally quit the industrial
sector altogether, rather than simply switch firms. They frequently quit before they had
found alternative work. The firms reported that they found the high levels of turnover
inconvenient, but were generally able to fill the positions with other low-skill workers since,
given the style of production, these workers required virtually no training. The firms were
reluctant to raise wages in order to reduce turnover.
Another reason people said they quit was that they found industrial work unpleasant
7

This push to formal employment, for instance, could not only reduce the uncertainty and volatility in
their incomes and employment, but potentially improve their long-term employment and earnings potential
through the experience and other human capital acquired in formal firms, or the potential to earn efficiency
wages and other wage premiums.

4

and hazardous to their health. Those who quit described the jobs as difficult, poorly paid,
and rigid. They also described a number of hazards, including chemical exposure.
Turning to the one-year experimental impacts, our results suggest the income gains from
industrial work were meager and the health risks substantial compared to controls, while the
entrepreneurship program raised incomes by a third without significant health costs.
First, because of the high quit rates, the job offer only had a modest effect on longterm employment. After a year, only 32% of the job arm was employed in any factory or
commercial farm, compared to 20% of the control group. Partly because of the high quit
rates, but also because industrial jobs offered more hours at lower wages, we see no evidence
that the job offer increased incomes on net.
Receiving the entrepreneurship program, however, significantly deterred people from joining an industrial firm and raised their earnings. Those who received the capital and training
invested a large proportion of the grant and shifted occupations from casual labor and industrial work to their own farms and petty business. Only 9% were in an industrial job at
the end of the year, compared to 20% in the control group, suggesting that relieving constraints on self-employment reduced industrial labor supply. After a year, earnings in the
entrepreneurship arm had risen by a third compared to the control group, without working
significantly more hours. This was only a gain of $1 a week, but an important gain given
they only earned $3 otherwise.
Turning to health impacts, industrial work appears to have doubled self-reported health
problems. The number of people reporting “great difficulty” performing simple daily activities (such as lifting heavy items or walking a short distance) increased from 4% among
controls to 7.3% in the industrial job offer arm. Qualitatively, workers reported repetitive
stress, kidney, and respiratory issues. These health impacts are large and striking, especially
considering that most respondents had quit the industrial job or the sector altogether by the
end of the year. These impacts come from spending just three additional months that year
in industry. For every additional month of industrial work induced by the job offer, people
were 1.1 percentage points more likely to report a disability of some form.
Why did workers apply and take poorly paid, hazardous jobs? Our data and research
design cannot say for sure, but in qualitative interviews many of the applicants said they used
industrial jobs as temporary employment to cope with adverse shocks and unemployment
spells. Also, to some extent, as youth with little formal sector experience, they were uncertain
about the nature of these jobs or their aptitude. They learned mainly through experience.
Finally, we also see weak evidence that workers who have baseline characteristics associated
with poor earning and employment aspects do see relative income gains from the job offer.
Thus workers with poor aptitude for informal work and self-employment might choose riskier
5

work for higher compensation. This is clearly not the case for higher aptitude workers,
however.
Naturally, workers were probably not perfectly informed about job risks and quality of
these jobs, and there is some qualitative evidence that they underestimated the unpleasantness and risk. Nonetheless, our data suggest that workers understood the health risks,
at least in part, did not update their assessment of the risks as a result of spending more
time in industry, and that they were willing to bear these risks to cope with temporary
unemployment spells. It is possible that the short term earnings, and ending of a temporary unemployment spell, were the compensating differential for risk. This is somewhat
speculative, but the degree to which workers understand health risks and how they seek
compensation is an important one for future research.
Otherwise, the search process for industrial work in Ethiopia seems to be relatively fast,
with little hint of constraints on mobility or barriers to learning once in the positions. There’s
no indication that the opportunity cost of time in trying out one of these jobs is high for
the firm or worker, at least for these largely disposable jobs. If not for the worrisome health
effects of these jobs, this would look like a relatively competitive, frictionless, integrated
labor market.
In Section 2, we describe the context in more detail, including the institutional features of
the labor market. Section 3 presents the experimental design and procedures used. Section
4 and 5 offer descriptive and experimental results. Section 6 offers a discussion of the results.

Setting

Firms exporting from Asia are looking to Ethiopia as a potential new industrial hub (The
Economist, 2014). The country has many advantages from a manufacturer’s point of view:
low wages, a politically stable and foreign investment-friendly regime, a domestic market of
94 million people, and proximity to Europe. Yet the country also remains quite poor, as
78% live under $2 a day in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, and agriculture employs
about 85% of the workforce.
Ethiopia has a long history of manufacturing, especially shoemaking, with some firms
in existence since the 1930s. Until the 1990s, however, Ethiopia was a command economy
with few private firms. In the last 15 years, the state has encouraged entry by private firms,
with relatively limited controls. In the years prior to our study, 2000–08, national income
and industrial output both grew about 10% per year, with the number of medium and large
manufacturers doubling in number.8 In 2009 there were 186,799 temporary and permanent
8

Industry has grown in absolute rather than relative terms, however, and the 13% share of industry in

6

employees in manufacturing firms with more than 10 employees (CSA, 2011). The country
has also attracted increasing levels of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), mainly from Turkey,
China, and India. It is concentrated in labor-intensive manufacturing, with three quarters
accounted for by garments and textiles and leather and footwear, followed by commercial
agriculture (Chen et al., 2015; World Bank, 2015).
This expansion is still small compared to levels of manufacturing FDI and industrial jobs
in countries such as Bangladesh, but is nonetheless large by African standards, and reflects
one of the continent’s few committed attempts to attract labor-intensive industries.
The beginning of the study, when firms were being recruited, was first a boom time followed by a mild slow down. The manufacturing census data for 2010/11 confirm that after
manufacturing employment growth between 2007/08 and 2009/10 of almost 50%, employment contracted between 2009/10 and 2010/11 by 6% (CSA, 2011). There was significant
sector variation, with industries such as textiles contracting considerably (more than 30% in
terms of employment), while footwear and food and beverages expanded.9 Even so, during
this period new foreign firms were entering the market and starting small plants, and some
domestic firms were continuing to invest and expand.
Over the last two decades, there has also been a transformation in Ethiopia’s urban labor
markets. They have become more flexible, with rising importance of private sector work,
with no obvious skill premiums between the private and public sector, and with lower (but
still considerable) urban unemployment.10 In all the firms in our study, and in general across
the private sector, employers can set wages without any legal restriction or reference to union
deals.11 The governing labor law makes it also relatively straightforward to fire an employee.
national income (and less than 5% for manufacturing) remained more or less constant throughout this period,
given high growth rates across all sectors of the economy(Söderbom, 2012). Nonetheless, manufactured
exports per capita rose by 10% per year over this period. This pace of growth in manufacturing, industrial
output and the general economy has continued since then (World Bank, 2015). In 2009 there were 739
manufacturing firms with more than 50 employees, including 138 state-owned firms (CSA, 2011).
9
Although no new census data have been released yet, Chen et al. (2015) have access to later data as
part of a World Bank study and report expansion in all these sectors in subsequent years.
10
See Bigsten et al. (2013) and Appendix A for a brief history of the Ethiopian labor market.
11
The private formal labor market is relatively flexible and unregulated. Ethiopia has no legal minimum
wage, but there are rights to unionization or collective bargaining. Unionization and collective bargaining
are most common in the public sector and state-owned enterprises. Unions are present in some private
enterprises (including in four of the five firms in our study). Still, trade union density remains limited.
Shortly before our study began, a national survey showed only 12.9 percent of wage and salary earners were
unionized (ILO, 2011). Still, they are largely focused on workers rights, benefits, and labor conditions, and
in none of the firms studied were they involved in wage setting.

Experimental design and procedures
Study firms and jobs

We worked in five firms, described in Table 1, with details in Appendix B. The firms were
from five sectors and four regions. Two firms hired more than one cohort over the study
period, 2010–13, for a total of eight cohorts. While this is a small number, the differences in
timing, region, and sectors reduced the influence of idiosyncratic shocks. Three firms engaged
in light manufacturing (textiles and garments, shoes, and beverages) and two in commercial
agriculture (flowers and vegetables). With the exception of the import-competing beverage
producer, all were export-oriented. Only one of the five was foreign-owned.
The positions required no experience, although the three manufacturers (not the two
farms) required applicants to have completed grade 8 or 10. The jobs involved working on
production lines—bottling water, picking and packing produce and flowers, cutting fabric,
or sewing shoes. They could involve heavy machinery or simple tools.
The positions required people to work 45 to 50 hours per week over 5 or 6 days. At the
time of the baseline surveys, the jobs typically paid a wage of $1 to $1.50 per day at 2010
market exchange rates (where $1 = 13.5 birr in 2010). Some firms offered non-wage benefits
such as on-site healthcare and bus transport.
The workplaces were professional and well-maintained, and firms never coerced employees. Nonetheless, health risks were common, especially: air quality (due to dust particles
or chemical fumes); discomfort and fainting from standing or lack of breaks or water; and
occasional safety hazards such as wet floors, sharp instruments, and so forth. In interviews, workers who worked with chemicals—typically cleaning solvents, pesticides, dyes or
glues—sometimes reported fainting from inhalation.
Most firms were unionized, but these were generally worker associations that mediated
disputes but did not engage in collective bargaining. Occasionally, however, we did observe
short strikes or walkouts in response to salary delays.

3.2

Site selection

We approached more than 300 private firms over two years, roughly half of all private industrial firms with 50 or more employees.12 We identified these firms through applications
for investment certificates, public business listings, industry associations, and personal con12

2009 census data suggest just over 500 private firms with more than 50 employees in the manufacturing
sector and less than 100 export-oriented commercial farms (CSA, 2011).

tacts.13 To be eligible for the study, a firm had to be in a manufacturing or commercial farm
sector, expect to hire a batch of at least 15 low-skill, full-time workers, and be willing to
randomly assign job offers within a pool of applicants the firm pre-screened.
To our surprise, more than three-quarters of the firms we approached were open to the
study.14 Relatively few existing firms, however, had plans to open a new production line (or
other major expansion) and thus hire a large batch of workers at once. There are several
apparent reasons for this. One is that sector growth was slowing in this period (though not
contracting, with the exception of the textile industry). Also, some of the sector growth was
coming from new firms, often but not always foreign-owned, who were reluctant to participate
because their start-up activities were already complicated and uncertain enough. Thus these
new entrants did not join our study; rather, we dealt with firms that tend to have several
years of operation already. Finally, not all existing firms planned to hire their employees in
bulk at one time, but rather planned to hire people more piecemeal, to accommodate more
gradual growth as well as cope with regular attrition. In the end, five existing firms (one
foreign-owned) had large expansion plans and followed through. At least two other firms
intended to participate, but suffered prolonged delays and did not open their new line during
the study period.15
Randomizing jobs proved uncontroversial in the labor-intensive industries that make up
most Ethiopian industry. While one might expect that firms want to select the best workers,
low-skill entry-level positions were often filled without a substantive interview process. In
most of the firms we approached, human resource managers described entry-level hiring as
ad hoc. For instance, we commonly witnessed firms filling low-skill positions on a first-come,
first-hire manner, with little or no interview process.
What are the five study firms a case of? Our firms were not a representative sample of
industrial firms in their sector, but broadly-speaking, our data suggest the jobs are similar to
other labor-intensive, low-skill, entry-level positions in the large textile, garment, footwear,
beverage, and commercial farming sectors, and thus different from positions in higher-skill

These firms are not a representative sample of all firms, but rather were our attempt to contact all firms
in textiles, leather, horticulture, and other manufacturing, especially firms that were expanding operations
(and hence requiring an investment certificate). We contacted most firms via phone or walk-in, though some
came from personal contacts.
14
They typically expressed interest in participation in the study for several reasons: curiosity in the
answer; the opportunity to bring some structure to relatively unstructured hiring processes; and an interest
in learning more about their applicant pool and the other opportunities available to their employees.
15
2010 to 2012 in Ethiopia was a period of moderate government financial repression and pre-election
uncertainty. Despite a growing economy and a boom in some sectors, such as construction, many of the
existing firms we approached were temporarily holding off on growth plans. Other common sources of delay
included difficulty in obtaining licenses, foreign exchange, importing equipment, and obtaining parts.

10

and heavier or more capital-intensive manufacturing.
It is reasonable to worry that firms willing to randomize employment were poorly managed or had unusual turnover. While possible, qualitatively we saw little difference between
our firms and the others we approached. On the contrary, all were expanding employment,
suggesting they had more credit and higher returns to investment than others.
Compared to a representative sample of industrial firms in 2014 in the capital Addis
Ababa, our five firms had higher revenues, lower profits, two to three times as many production employees, and lower-skilled employees.16 Given the low-skill nature of the work and
the entry-level positions, starting salaries were lower than the manufacturing average—at
roughly the 25th percentile of manufacturers in the capital. Since most of our firms are
outside the capital, the purchasing power of their wages is greater, probably putting them
between the 25th and 50th percentile in terms of wages. Moreover, comparing wages to the
distribution quoted in the 2009/10 census of manufacturing firms suggest that they were not
at all uncommon for the specific sectors involved.17

3.3

Stimulating self-employment through grants and training

Starting with the second cohort, the entrepreneurship treatment arm offered people five days
of business training and planning, followed by an unconditional cash grant of nearly 5000
Birr, or roughly $300 at the time it was given (see Table 1).18 We chose the amount based
on our qualitative assessment of the costs required to set up a part-time enterprise, plus the
limits of what we could afford.
Professional skills trainers led classes of about 20, and each person also received individual
mentoring during those five days.19 While we framed the cash grant as a business start-up
fund, throughout the intervention we made clear that it was nonetheless an unconditional
grant and grantees were free to use it as they saw fit—savings, consumption, or investment.
Subjects had to complete at least three days of the training, however, to receive the grant.
16

See Appendix C for data and analysis.
The modal workers in the census earned between 400-600 birr in 2010 prices, with the second most
common interval 200-400 birr, jointly making up 40% of the workforce in manufacturing in general and more
than 60% in textiles or footwear (CSA, 2011). The wages of the workers in our sample fall in these ranges.
18
Total implementation cost was roughly $450 per person including the grant, training, and local program
administration. The grant amount varied slightly from cohort to cohort because of inflation, currency
devaluation, and tax issues. For cohorts 2 to 4, a for-profit firm ran the intervention and was required to
withhold tax on the grants. To minimize the tax burden the cash was disbursed in two tranches several weeks
apart. We used a for-profit firm because we could not find a non-profit organization willing to disburse
cash without conditions at low cost. For cohorts 5 to 8, we ran the intervention through a parastatal
research organization to avoid the tax burden. The amount of the grant was increased to maintain the rough
purchasing power and disbursed in a single tranche to reduce implementation costs.
19
Cohorts 2 and 3 also received a follow-up visit by the trainer after three months for additional advice.
Grantees did not see this service as helpful, and given the cost it was discontinued after cohort 3.

3.4

Experimental procedures

We followed each firm’s standard procedures for hiring batches of new employees to staff
new production lines: The firms advertised jobs through a posting on the front gate, word
of mouth, and local job boards.20
In order to ensure sufficient applicants, we only made one change to standard procedures:
we assisted the firm in posting more notices within a wider radius than usual (usually no more
than a few kilometers). Since the firm typically drew employees from this radius, we expected
this to generate an applicant pool very similar to the usual one. It is possible, however, that
the experimental pool of applicants is further outside the family/friend network, and lives
slightly further from the factory, than would otherwise have been the case. That said, most
applicants live within a few miles of the firm, and so are extremely local by any measure.
(The firms, who were reluctant to hire people who lived far away, reported that they did not
think the distance would make a material distance, since all live nearby.)
Applicants were instructed to gather on a specific day. Firm managers would then screen
written or verbal applications, typically based on firm- or job-specific minimum education
and health requirements. Some firms also preferred specific age ranges or genders for different
positions. Across the study cohorts, between 75 and 95% of applicants passed these criteria
and thus entered the study sample. We do not have data on ineligible applicants.
The research team then debriefed eligible applicants on the random assignment to the
job, and informed them for the first time about the grant. Nearly all agreed to enter the
study and were invited to complete a baseline survey. Afterwards we randomized people
to each treatment group via computer, stratified by gender. The firm posted the names of
people receiving the job offer at the factory site and the research team contacted all those
assigned to the job or grant. Job offers began within a few days. We gave each firm a
list of unsuccessful applicants and asked the firm not to hire them for at least 1–2 months.
In practice, however, the firms kept poor records and within a few days or weeks of the
randomization could have hired control group members.

3.5

Study participants and balance

Table 2 reports characteristics of the eligible applicants at baseline, from self-reported surveys, and tests of balance.21 80% were women. The average applicant was 22 and had

To fill vacancies on existing production lines, the hiring process was typically much different. Only
one or two people might be needed at a time. Applicants would be interviewed on a first-come, first-serve
basis. Sometimes word would go out through existing employees (referrals). But this was not the procedure
followed for large hiring batches like the ones we studied.
21
Applicants completed a 90-minute baseline survey plus 45 minutes of interactive games, with real money,
to measure time and risk preferences, and cognitive abilities such as executive function. An Ethiopian

12

completed grade 9. Most were unmarried. They had 7.5 hours of work per week, typically
a portfolio of activities such as farming, casual labor, or petty business. They had earned
little cash in the previous month. They were inexperienced. Only 27% had worked in a
large, formal firm before, and only 19% in a factory. Based on qualitative interviews, most
applicants had only a hazy idea of the type and difficulty of the work in advance, and often
only learned the salary being offered at the time of hiring. Work conditions and paths for
progression were poorly understood.
The experimental sample was imbalanced across the treatment arms at baseline. Of the
34 covariates across two treatments, 8 of the 68 mean differences (12%) have p < .1. Those
assigned to jobs are less likely to be married and have slightly lower executive functions and
education compared to the control group. Those assigned to the entrepreneurship program
have lower assets and more firm experience. A test of joint significance of all covariates has
a p-value of 0.04 for the job offer and 0.02 for the entrepreneurship program. To minimize
bias, we control for baseline covariates when estimating treatment effects.

3.6

Outcomes and attrition after one year

We ran endline surveys 11- and 13-months after job offers, for two rounds of data on lowautocorrelation outcomes (such as weekly employment hours and earnings), thus increasing
statistical precision in a fixed sample (McKenzie, 2012).22 At 11 months we also attempted
to interview the household head for household labor allocations, wealth, and attitudes.
Our sample frequently moved between survey rounds. We tracked 88% of individuals
after 11 months, 85% after 13 months, and also interviewed 90% of their households. These
rates of attrition are comparable to or lower than other panels of young adults in Africa (e.g.
Baird et al., 2015; Blattman et al., 2014). Note, however, that 5.3% were not interviewed
because they left the country. Young Ethiopians commonly migrate to the Middle East for
temporary domestic work and construction. Based on qualitative interviews with emigrants,
these jobs can pay significantly higher wages than domestic factories, but may have fixed
costs of entry and potentially severe disamenities, such as extremely long hours, no days
off, infrequent family contact, restricted freedoms, and sometimes abuse. We know whether
someone emigrated, but we do not have survey outcomes. Based on household interviews, we
estimate 4% of the control group emigrated, and emigration is 2.1 percentage points higher
among those assigned to a job and 2.8 points higher among those assigned to a grant (both
enumerator delivered surveys and the games verbally in the local language. The games remunerated the
respondent with roughly a half days wages.
22
See Appendix D.6 for a comparison of results from just one round of data collection versus two, to
demonstrate the value added of adding the second round. The point estimates are slightly higher with just
one round of data, but the precision is much lower.

Notes: Medians are imputed for baseline variables with missing observations. Treatment and control

effects have a standard error of .017 and so are not statistically significant). Since there is
a small treatment differential, this could mean that the estimated income treatment effects
are too low, and estimated impacts on quality of life measures (such as mental health) are
too low. We bound treatment effects for different attrition scenarios in Section 5.7 below,
and see no reason migration should affect our core conclusions.
Overall, across the two surveys, response rates were 87.4% in the job arm, 87.4% in the
entrepreneurship arm, and 84.2% in the control arm. Controlling for baseline covariates,
attrition (including emigration) is 2.3 percentage points higher in the control group than the
treatments, but this is not statistically significant.23 Attrition is, however, associated with
covariates: it is higher among women and those who were poorer, had less formal sector
experience, and were less conscientious at baseline (a personality trait that indicates lower
perseverance and discipline).24 This is a further reason to control for baseline covariates when
calculating treatment effects. We bound these effects for attrition scenarios as well.

3.7

Qualitative data

During site visits to several dozen factories and commercial farms we conducted informal
interviews with workers and managers. At each study firm we systematically interviewed
managers at every level from senior management to line managers. Research assistants also
interviewed 138 workers and microenterprise owners, both in and out of the sample. They
also conducted 60 exit interviews by phone with sample members who quit the study firms.

Descriptive analysis

Some of the first insights into industrial work come from collecting and analyzing panel data
on largely unemployed industrial job seekers. In addition to reporting take-up of the experimental treatments, this section discusses what summary statistics, time trends, and simple
observational analysis tell us about the treatments as well as employment opportunities in
the absence of treatment.

4.1

Job take-up, retention, and turnover

First, we see that large numbers of people applying for industrial jobs turned down a job
offer or quit quickly. Within a few months of the offer, most quit both the job and the
23

15

industrial sector as a whole. Table 3 reports take-up and turnover rates, and differences by,
treatment arm.
If offered the job, 10% did not show up the first day. A further 20% quit within a
month. After a year, 77% had quit the study firm (there were very few firings or involuntary
separations). Meanwhile, 13% of the control group was hired by a study firm during the year.
Most of these people quit as well. Controlling for covariates, assignment to a job increased
the chances an applicant held that job for at least a month by 57 percentage points relative
to the control group, but assignment to a job offer increased the probability they held that
job at endline by just 17 percentage points.
People did not simply quit the factory job: they tended to leave the sector altogether (or
fail to find another job in the sector). Between baseline and endline, 69% of the control group
held a formal sector job of any form for a least a month, and 43% worked in some kind of
industrial firm. Being assigned a job offer to one of our study firms increases the probability
of working a month or more in an industrial firm by 41 percentage points. Being assigned
to the entrepreneurship program, meanwhile, decreases this probability by 15 percentage
points.25
By the end of the year, only 32% of those assigned to an industrial job still worked in the
sector in the month before the survey, compared to 20% in the control group. Thus very few
of those who quit the study firm went to another industrial firm. In fact, in exit interviews,
many firm employees reported that they quit despite having no outside opportunity at that
time.
Who stayed versus quit? Table 4 reports the correlates of industrial job retention among
those assigned to the industrial job offer or the control group (results are similar regardless
of the sample we use). Those who stayed were older and had less formal work experience,
lower executive function26 , lower conscientiousness, greater physical health (measured by a
self-reported disability, discussed below), and weakly greater future orientation (based on
self-reported time preferences plus play in incentivized games).27 One interpretation is that
people with observable human capital (education, experience) had good outside options,
while those with less observable skills and productivity (future orientation, or productivity
reflected in their initial outside earnings) were less likely to leave.
25

Of those assigned to the entrepreneurship program, 3% could not be reached and 2% declined the training
and cash or dropped out midway, typically (they said) due to illness or a preference for full time work.
26
Also know as working memory, it is used to perform activities such as planning, organizing, strategizing,
paying attention to details, and managing time and space. We measure it through a combination of forward
and backward digit recall tests, as well as a modified Stroop test that tests inhibitory control.
27
We have survey questions related to patience and self-control in everyday situations. We also play
games involving trade-offs of real money over time, which we use to calculate a discount rate. We average
all measures and standardize the index.

Notes: A study firm is one of our five firms. The formal sector includes any formal firm with 10 or more employees in any sector. By
“industrial firm” we mean any manufacturer or commercial farm. Indicators for working at least a month in a firm since baseline are equal
to 1 if it was reported in the 11- or 13-month endline. The # of months worked in a firm since baseline is calculated up to the 13-month
endline, where those data are available. The indicator for working in any firm at endline equals one if they reported such work at either
endline. The estimates in Columns (5) to (8) come from an OLS regressions of the dependent variable on assignment to job and assignment

Grant use

We do not have precise investment figures, but we returned to all grant recipients 6–8 weeks
after the grant and asked them to describe how they had used the cash by allocating 30
tokens across 12 pictures representing different expenditures. They indicated that 55% of
the grant went to business materials or investments, 35% to savings or cash on hand, and
10% to consumption or transfers. Money is fungible (among other weaknesses of these data)
but nonetheless the exercise implies the that young people sought to smooth the income
shock and put at least $165 of the $300 into enterprises.

4.3

Employment and earnings in and out of industrial work

At baseline, most applicants had little work or earnings. So why quit a permanent job?
First, the panel data suggest that applicants were in a temporary employment slump, perhaps
because they had recently lost a job, were new entrants, or were re-entering the labor market
after a period of no employment. Hence baseline earnings and employment levels did not
reflect most people’s options over a longer horizon.
In the control group, for example, the share of participants with no employment hours
whatsoever fell from 68% at baseline to 36% at endline, and average hours of work per week
rose from 7.5 to 26.28 As a result, average weekly earnings in the control group more than
tripled from baseline to endline, from 9 to 33 Birr (all values in the text are in 2010 prices).
Most of their work was in the informal sector: farm or casual labor, petty business or salaried
work in an informal firm.
This is unlikely to come from a common labor demand shock. Depending on the cohort,
the endline was conducted at either a boom or mild slowdown.The eight cohorts of hires
began at different points in time and space over two years, with highly varied macroeconomic
conditions, and this employment rise is consistent across the cohorts.
Second, while receiving an industrial job increased the hours and earnings available (and
while keeping a job reduced the risk of an unemployment spell), industrial work paid wages
that were similar or lower than most people’s non-industrial options. Table 5 reports the
employment levels, earnings, and average earnings per hour (“wages”) for those with and
without any industrial work at endline. Our estimate of the wage premium from industrial
work comes from an OLS regression of each outcome on an indicator for any employment in
a factory or farm at endline plus select baseline covariates and cohort fixed effects.29 We look
28
The largest increases in hours came from factory and farm wage labor, casual non-farm labor (e.g.
construction), and salaried labor in non-industrial organizations (such as shops, offices, etc.).
29
To the extent that these covariates capture the endogenous determinants of occupational choice and
matching with an industrial firm, the coefficient on the factory/farm work indicator can be interpreted as

19

at this premium with and without the “unemployed”, which for the purposes of this table
we redefine as those with fewer than five hours of work per week on average. We can also
look with and without baseline controls to observe the effect of selection on the “premium”.
At endline, 39% of the sample worked fewer than 5 hours per week. Including these
“unemployed” members of the sample (in the top panel), people outside factory work had
only about 20.7 hours of work a week and 28.0 Birr in weekly earnings. Conditional on being
employed 5 or more hours a week (bottom panel), however, the non-industrial opportunities
were better: 41.5 hours a week, and 54.7 Birr in earnings.
Overall, the data suggest that an industrial job increased hours and the potential for total
earnings because (if people stayed in the job) it limited unemployment spells that came with
the unpredictable and often temporary nature of mostly informal work. Compared to people
employed in other sectors, there was an increase in hours and total earnings from working
in an industrial firm, but only the rise in hours is statistically significant.30
More striking, the coefficient on earnings per hour in an industrial job is actually negative
and statistically significant at the 5% level. It appears that, if anything, industrial work is
more poorly remunerated than non-industrial work (when such work is available).

Experimental analysis
Empirical strategy

To estimate program impacts on outcome Y , we calculate the intent-to-treat (ITT) estimate
of an offer of a job or entrepreneurship program via OLS:
Yirj = αj + γr=13 + θJ Jobij + θE Entrepreneurij + βXij + ij
where Job and Entrepreneur are indicators for random assignment to the treatment arms.
We control for the baseline covariates, X, listed in Table 2, as well as gender-cohort fixed
the causal effect of industrial jobs. This assumption of conditional unconfoundedness is probably too strong,
and the coefficient is undoubtedly biased, but it nonetheless gives, to a first approximation, a sense of the
returns to industrial work. We cannot use assignment to an industrial job as an instrument since it would
violate the exclusion restriction; assignment to a factory job could affect current earnings even if a year later
the individual is no longer in the job.
30
Likewise, Table 9 below looks at the complier average causal effect. The coefficient on earnings is positive
and reasonably large, indicating that compliers earn more because of the larger aggregate number of hours.
But this estimate is not statistically significant.

effects, αj . We pool both 11- and 13-month survey rounds, r, and we include a fixed effect
for the 13-month round and cluster (robust) standard errors by individual.31 In principle,
the request not to hire the control group members for a short while is a violation of the stable
unit treatment values assumption (SUTVA) but given that this request was short term and
(as we will see) mainly ignored, it is unlikely to affect our estimates of impact.
Our tables also report θJ − θE for completeness. Except for the artificial environment
of this research project, however, the grant is not a meaningful counterfactual for the job
offer, and so the specific difference should be taken with caution. It is principally useful for
comparing whether the risks or benefits of industrial work are echoed in the intensification
of entrepreneurial work.
Note that all outcomes are self-reported, and each treatment arm was aware of their
assignment and the existence of other arms. Thus there is the potential for self-reported
outcomes to vary with treatment status. As with most low-income countries, there are no
administrative data on earnings. And as with most countries there are no systematic and
available administrative data on health or informal earnings.
Complier average causal effects
Given the high quit rates, we also calculate a complier average treatment effect (CATE),
where we use Job as an instrument for the number of months since baseline the person
worked in a formal firm with 10 or more employees. The CATE gives us an approximate
sense of the effect of staying longer in industrial work. From Table 3 below, those in the
control group worked an average of 3.2 months in a formal job, and this roughly doubles with
a job offer. Thus the ITT represents the impact of temporarily ending a person’s search and
increasing the probability they start and stay with an industrial job. The CATE estimates
the effect of an additional month of industrial work.
There are reasons to treat this CATE with caution. In principle a job offer could affect
outcomes through some mechanism other than weeks worked (e.g. people who learn and
quit after a day).32 As an approximation, however, these CATE results give us a sense of
the consequences of longer time in industrial work.33
31

Given that randomization is at the individual level, there is little reason to cluster standard errors at a
unit of analysis higher than the randomization, such as the cohort (Angrist and Pischke, 2008; Abadie et al.,
2016). Given the small number of cohorts, moreover, the asymptotic requirements of clustering would not
be met.
32
Also, using the number of months in industrial work as the endogenous variable assumes a linear effect
size, but if the effect is not linear then the random job offer will not necessarily be a valid instrument (since
it will also affect e.g. number of weeks squared and other nonlinear terms).
33
Alternatively, we could use “had any industrial work” as the endogenous variable. Since almost 90%
work at least a day when offered a job, however, the results would not be materially different than a simple

22

Transitory versus permanent impacts
To the extent that study subjects are in a temporary unemployment spell at baseline, the
job offer will lead to an immediate increase in employment and income relative to control
group subjects, who remain in an unemployment spell. We did not measure these short
term, largely mechanical increases in income and employment. Rather, we measure income
and employment 11 and 13 months later. We anticipated that any transitory shocks leading
subjects to apply to the factory at baseline would be resolved by this time. As a result, our
research design was intended to capture the more permanent effects on income, employment,
and other aspects of well being.
That said, if unemployment spells tend to be long in the absence of the job offer, there is a
risk that any treatment effect on income or employment reflect the persistence of transitory
shocks. This is especially true for permanent income measures, such as consumption or
durable assets, due to income smoothing. Partly for this reason, we also plan for longer term
follow up surveys in future.
Mitigating the risk of cherry-picking hypotheses
This experiment predated the development of the social science registry and the trend toward
registering hypotheses and producing detailed pre-analysis plans. Thus our theoretical priors,
estimation strategy, and outcomes were not formally pre-specified and archived.
In light of this, we try to limit concerns of cherry-picking in several ways. First, our
theoretical priors, including expectations of an employment and wage premium, were documented in various funding proposals as well as a short policy note discussing “pilot results”
from the very first hiring cohort.34
Second, to reduce the number of hypothesis tests and risk of “false positives”, we follow
Kling et al. (2007) and collect major outcomes into family indexes, which are additive,
standardized indexes of related outcomes. We focus on eight families of outcomes. Four
are directly affected by industrial work: employment, income, physical health, and mental
health. Four are indirect, in that changes are likely to be a result of “first-stage” changes in
one of the direct outcome: attitudes to industrial work/firms, social integration, autonomy,
and non-cognitive skills.35
ITT, and any other indicator (such as “worked at least a month in an industrial job”) would not pass the
exclusion restriction.
34
http://www.theigc.org/publication/more-sweatshops-for-africa-pilot-results-from-an-experimentalstudy-of-industrial-labor-in-ethiopia-policy-brief/
35
The direct outcomes, plus social integration, were the focus of the published policy note, prior to endline
data collection on 7 of the 8 cohorts, illustrating that this division and emphasis is not simply post hoc.

23

Third, the paper reports treatment effects on all outcomes measured in the endline survey.
We collected a small number of measures on time use, school enrollment, emigration, or
workplace conditions for largely descriptive or exploratory purposes, and these do not easily
fit into the eight major families above. We discuss impacts on these other outcomes in the
text, but report formal treatment effects in the appendix.
Multiple comparison adjustments
In addition to variable reduction, we can go further and also consider more conservative
p-values to account for the fact that we are testing multiple hypotheses. Below we present
unadjusted standard errors as well as p-values adjusted for multiple comparisons, so that
readers can use the threshold appropriate to their question and preferences. We use the
Westfall and Young (1993) free step-down resampling method for the family-wise error rate
(FWER), the probability that at least one of the true null hypotheses will be falsely rejected,
using randomization inference.36 All results are generally robust to fairly conservative adjustments, such as for all eight family indexes (direct and indirect). Figure 1 summarizes the
one-year ITT estimates of the effect of each treatment on standardized indexes for the eight
direct and indirect outcome families, including both unadjusted and adjusted p-values. As
illustrated in Appendix D.3, we draw the same qualitative conclusions if we adjust for both
treatment arms (hence 16 comparisons).

5.2

Impacts on employment/occupational choice

To measure occupational and earnings impacts, at each endline we asked respondents whether
they had engaged in 22 occupations, from farming to petty business, trades, and formal jobs.
For each one, we collected self-reported hours and net earnings in both the last week and
the week prior. With two endline surveys this gives us four weeks of employment data per
person. People reported 0 to 3 occupations, with an average of 0.75 (1.13 among those
reporting any). We calculate total hours and earnings across all occupations each week, and
estimate treatment effects on the average of the two weeks of data.
Table 6 reports ITT estimates on the overall family index, the components of the index,
as well as a set of other economic outcomes measures in the survey that are of interest but
do not fit conceptually in employment/occupational choice and income. We adjust p-values
for family indexes but do not adjust p-values for the components of indexes, or for other
outcomes, and so those results must be taken with some caution, and be viewed as more
36

Other papers taking this approach include Kling et al. (2007); Casey et al. (2012); Anderson (2008).
Using the Westfall-Young bootstrap and the Holm-adjusted Bonferroni methods yields similar results.

suggestive and descriptive in nature. We report on them mainly to help understand the
substantive nature of the indexes and interpret what changes may mean.
There was no change in total hours worked per week among those offered an industrial job,
but occupations shift. Factory and commercial farm labor increased while petty business,
casual labor, and other activities decreased. Those assigned to the entrepreneurship program,
meanwhile, increased total hours worked by 3.5 per week (significant at the 10% level only)
and shifted their time towards smallholder farming and petty business, as well as medium
skilled salaried labor (e.g. white collar jobs).37
The difference between the employment and occupational choice index in the entrepreneurship arm and in the job offer arm is less than 0.04 standard deviations and statistically not
37
A family index of hours worked, unemployment, and the standard deviation of hours does not rise
significantly because the increase in the standard deviation of hours enters negatively into the index. If we
exclude or reverse the direction of this volatility measure, the rise in employment is highly significant. In
Appendix D.2, we display histograms of average weekly hours and estimated earnings in the past month for
the job offer and control groups. They are broadly similar.

significant.
The employment family index does not include information on general time use or school
enrollment. We measured these in the survey for exploratory purposes, however, and report impacts in Appendix D.4. Not surprisingly, assignment to industrial work or the entrepreneurship program had little impact on time use, whether commute time (about 4 hours
a week) or chores (20 hours on average per week). Those assigned to the entrepreneurship
program report 3.6 fewer leisure hours per week compared to the control group (significant
at the 5% level). School enrollment is 3.2 percentage points lower among those assigned to
a job, about half the control mean (though significant at only the 10% level).

5.3

Impacts on income

We use three measures of income. One is the sum of weekly cash earnings across the 22 occupations.38 Earnings are seasonal and do not reflect home production, so we also consider
two measures of permanent income reported by the household: an index of 32 durable consumption assets (e.g. housing quality, furniture) and the value of non-durable consumption
in the previous 4 weeks via an abbreviated consumption module of 82 items.39
On balance the factory job offer seems to have no significant effect on income by any
of the three measures, and a family index of the three increases only 0.014 standard deviations.40 These income measures tend to be skewed and highly variable, however, and so our
estimates are imprecise. Thus while the average effect is close to zero, the confidence interval
on income includes moderate increases and decreases in income from the industrial job offer.
Even if the income effect after a year is negligible, the job offer could have still had an
important impact on annual income by ending lengthy unemployment spells. Several results
indicate this was not the case. One is that two of our three income measures (consumption
and assets) are measures of permanent income, and so we would expect them to reflect large
recent shocks, even if temporary. Moreover, if we use the survey data to estimate total
annual income, we do not see any evidence of an increase. We do not have data on hours
and wages in the firms at the time of hire to calculate exactly, however.
The entrepreneurship program has a sizable effect on income, however, an impact that
seems to be driven by the small business rather than a direct wealth effect of the grant,
as the impact shows up in earnings more than assets and consumption. Weekly earnings
38

As a check against this weekly and activity-based measure, we also ask respondents to estimate their
total cash earnings in the past four weeks. The treatment effects are similar.
39
See Beegle et al. (2012) for this approach. This abbreviated measure likely understates total consumption
by excluding durable asset use and less common purchases. We do not have price data for valuing durables.
40
We also ask about savings flows in the past month and see no evidence of an increase (see Appendix
D.4). Including this in the income index has not effect on our conclusions.

27

in the entrepreneurship arm are 12 Birr higher than the control group. In absolute terms
this is roughly $1 per week ($3.4 PPP), and in relative terms this is a large effect—a one
third increase in earnings for otherwise very poor young people. If we assume this earnings
gain lasted the whole year, those assigned to the entrepreneurship program earned about
$52 more since baseline—about 16% of the full grant, or 32% of the amount they said they
initially invested. If we deduct compensation for added hours worked, these figures fall to
7% and 13%.41 These are not necessarily high returns, especially when we consider that
the recipients also received training in addition to the capital, though the returns are higher
when using our estimated measures of annual hours worked and total income: about 16% of
the grant after accounting for added hours worked.
Looking at the income family index, the increase in income in the entrepreneurship arm
is significant at the 5% level after adjusting for eight comparisons. Note that it is only significant at the 10% level when we adjust for 16 comparisons (across outcomes and treatment
arms). Furthermore, Table 6 shows that the job arm earns 0.14 standard deviations less
than the entrepreneurship arm, significant at the 10% level.
Note that a job offer does not lead to less volatile earnings or works hours compared to
the alternatives. If we take the standard deviation of weekly work hours or weekly earnings
for the four weeks of data available, we see no evidence of a significant decrease from a job
offer (indeed the point estimate on the standard deviation of earnings is positive).42 The
cash grant, meanwhile, increases the standard deviation of weekly work hours and weekly
earnings.
Heterogeneous employment and earnings impacts
The zero average treatment effect on earnings conceals some heterogeneity, reported in Table 7. We divide the sample into two groups—those with high and low outside earnings
potential—constructed using an index of baseline characteristics that predicts endline earnings in the absence of treatment.43 We interact the indicator for above median earnings
potential with treatment. As a result, the coefficient on assignment to the job offer can be
41
Entrepreneurship recipients work 3.5 more hours per week, valued at 5 Birr per week at the average
wage, from Table 6. We subtract this from the 12 Birr per week.
42
See Appendix D.2 for histograms of average weekly hours and estimated earnings in the past month for
the job offer and control groups. They are broadly similar.
43
For members of the control group, we regress endline earnings on all baseline covariates and use the
estimated coefficients to predict an outcome. To avoid endogenous stratification, we do this for each control
group member individually, excluding their own observation from the fitted model (see Abadie et al. (2014)
for a description of this “leave-one-out” method). We then use the estimated coefficients from the full control
group to predict earnings potential for the treatment group. We use these predictions to create an indicator
for above- and below-median earnings potential, and interact this indicator with indicators for assignment
to treatments.

interpreted as the treatment effect on applicants with characteristics associated with below
median earnings opportunities. The sum of this coefficient and the coefficient on the interaction (reported at the base of the table) can be interpreted as the effect of a job offer on
applicants with characteristics associated with above median earnings. This heterogeneity
analysis was not prespecified and so must be taken with some caution, but also happens to
be the only heterogeneity we analyzed.
Regardless of their earnings prospects, those assigned to job offer are about 9 percentage
points more likely to be working in an industrial firm at endline (Column 1). The job offer
weakly increases earnings for applicants with low predicted outside earning potential, but
has no apparent effect on applicants with high outside earning potential (Column 2). The
difference (the interaction term) is not statistically significant. Substantively, however, the
figures are large. At endline, control group members with below median earnings potential
earned just 11.6 Birr per week on average (compared to 34 Birr per week for the full control
group). Thus the 10.6 Birr treatment effect on low types is nearly a doubling in earnings.
This comes almost entirely for an increase in the hours of work available, not the wage.
While the wide standard errors suggest caution, overall these patterns imply that people
with poor self-employment or wage prospects may be able to increase their earnings in the

29

industrial sector because it offers them more regular employment than they could otherwise
find. For people with stronger self-employment and wage prospects, however, accepting a
job can have persistent effects on occupational choice a year later, even if the quality of the
match is poor.44
Interestingly, the entrepreneurship program seems to increase earnings among both highand low- predicted outside earning potential. This could imply that low outside earning
potential is driven by liquidity and credit constraints rather than innate ability.

5.4

Impacts on physical health

Table 8 reports impacts on our measures of health and well-being. One of the main measures
of physical health is self-reported ability to perform five activities of daily life, or ADLs: walk
2 km, work outside on your feet for a full day, carry a 20 liter carton of water 20 meters, do
usual daily activities, and standing at workbench working for 6-8 hours.45 Each is measured
on a 0–3 scale running from unable (0), great difficulty (1), slight difficulty (2) and easily (3).
ADL measures are widely used in studies of labor supply or health and economic development
in developed and developing countries, including in Africa, and they have been tested for
consistency across tests, interviewers, and skills.46
We also code an indicator for a “disability”, which we define as reporting “great difficulty”
or “unable” on at least two ADLs. 4% of the control group report such a disability at endline.
Otherwise, most people in our sample are young and in excellent health, and so report nearly
perfect ADLs (14 of a potential score of 15 on average).
Finally, we collect a subjective measure of health using Cantril’s Self-Anchoring scale,
a life evaluation approach commonly used in Gallup polls and social science studies (e.g.
Kahneman and Deaton, 2010). We gave respondents a picture of three ladders, with ten
rungs each, where the top rung represented the best health and the lowest the worst health.
An industrial job is associated with a 0.27 decrease in the ADL index and a 0.23 decline in
subjective health evaluations. While these declines are small relative to the means, they seem
44

One cautionary note: it is possible that the “high” types who stay, and have lower earnings than their
peers in the control group, are actually low ability in some unobserved way, and that their low earnings
reflect their low marginal product. While possible, it is worth noting we have an unusually rich set of
baseline covariates going far beyond the usual Mincerian regressions, including time preferences, personality
traits, work histories, mental abilities (such as executive function), and other covariates that are typically
strong determinants of lifetime earnings potential.
45
We adapted the five questions from existing ADL instruments to the context in Ethiopia. We are not
aware of a standardized or validated ADL instrument for either Ethiopia or sub-Saharan Africa.
46
See for example Ware et al. (1980); Strauss and Thomas (2007). ADLs are commonly used in household
surveys and program evaluations because they are more common than morbidity and mortality in small or
short-run samples, and because measures such as days ill or away from work may be endogenous to labor
supply decisions.

to be driven by a few people reporting more serious disabilities at the tail of the distribution.
The disability rate rises 3.3 percentage points among those offered an industrial job, nearly
doubling the risk of injury. A family index of the health measures suggests job recipients
report a 0.19 standard deviation decline in health, and the effect is significant at the 1%
level using conventional p-value cutoffs and at the 5% level after adjusting for eight multiple
comparisons (Figure 1).
Our qualitative interviews suggest a number of common ailments, especially repetitive
stress injuries from standing or repeated tasks, or respiratory problems due (people report)
to dust, particulates, or chemical fumes. We do not know if these represent chronic or
temporary problems, but there is some suggestion they may be permanent problems. We
asked people to rate their subjective health five years from now on the same ladder. The
control mean rose, but the treatment effect is similar to the subjective health today.
These results are also robust to different ways of coding “disabilities” (Appendix D.5).
They are also robust to excluding any one firm from the estimates, although disabilities seem
to be highest in the horticultural firm and shoe factory (Appendix D.8).
Table 9 reports the CATEs for main outcomes. The clearest impact is on health. Each
additional week in an industrial firm is associated with about a 1.1 percentage point increase
in a serious difficulty performing two or more standard activities of daily life.
We have to take these results with some caution. First, only a small absolute number of

32

people report “great difficulty” at an ADL: 10 in the control group and 15 in the job offer arm.
Second, these are self-reported data and in principle measurement error could be correlated
with treatment.47 Unfortunately, we do not have objective tests of health or disability.
Finally, note that the difference between the average health of the job offer arm and the
health of the entrepreneurship arm is not statistically significant, as the entrepreneurship
arm also experiences a small, statistically insignificant reduction in health. The general
magnitude of the job treatment effect remains, but it loses its statistical significance. This
may be because self-employment carries its own occupational risks, or because (as we mention
above) the results are based on a small number of extreme injuries.
Adverse health impacts are consistent with self-reported workplace conditions
Nonetheless, the results are consistent with worker’s descriptions of factory workplace conditions. We asked survey respondents to describe the amenities and disamenities of their
endline workplace, largely for descriptive purposes. Table 10 reports summary statistics,
treatment effects, and correlations with endline employment status.
14% of the control group reported serious health risks at their place of work, and this
increased 7.8 percentage points in the job offer arm. 27% reported a need for greater safety
equipment in their place of work, and this increased 11 percentage points in the job offer arm.
These health concerns do not appear to be associated with air quality or general workplace
comfort, since we see little effect of treatment on these measures. We see a weak treatment
effect on complaints of chemical smells. We see no other statistically significant treatment
effects of the job offer on other workplace conditions other than these health-related ones.
These ITT estimates likely understate the disamenities of industrial work, given that
most people assigned to industrial jobs quit the sector. Columns 6 to 9 of Table 10 report
the results of a simple OLS regression of workplace conditions on an indicator for endline
industrial work, controlling for baseline covariates, first on the full sample and then limiting
the sample to those with non-zero hours of work. Working in an industrial job is associated
with at least a 28 percentage point increase in perceived health risks (especially chemicals
but also smoke), a more than 40 percentage point increase in the perception of a need for
safety equipment, and at least a 35 percentage point increase in complaints of chemicals. In
47
Self-perceptions of health might be affected endogenously by work experiences, for example. Our disability treatment effect, for instance, becomes smaller and no longer statistically significant if we exclude
either the “working outdoors for a full day” or the “standing all day at a workbench” components. These
are the components with the largest and most statistically significant. While this may be worrisome, it is
worth noting that if we use the “some difficulty” threshold for a disability indicator, the largest and most
significant components are “carrying 20 liters” and “performing daily activities”, and the overall impact of
the job offer on disability is statistically significant and robust to excluding “working outdoors for a full day”
or the “standing all day at a workbench” components. See Appendix D.5 for this sensitivity analysis.

Impacts on mental health and happiness

Table 8 also considers a number of self-reported facets of mental health and well being.
First, we used pre-existing, validated questionnaires on depression and anxiety symptoms,
and examine additive indices of the symptoms and their severity.48 In general people report
very few symptoms. We also asked people four questions about their financial worries,
including whether they worried about meeting expenses for education, health expenses, and
other essential costs, as well as worrying about being able to afford less than others (each
on a 0–3 scale of severity). These are also relatively rare, perhaps because many are young
people living at home with lower middle class families, and generally have enough to eat.
Finally, to measure subjective well being (happiness) we used the same life evaluation ladder
as with health, but where the top rung represented the best possible life and the lowest the
worst possible.
In general we see no evidence of an effect of the job offer on mental health, and weak evidence of an increase in subjective well-being now (but not in five years). The entrepreneurship program, however, led to small but statistically significant decreases in self-reported
financial anxiety, as well as a rise in subjective well-being. There were also small declines in
depression and anxiety symptoms, and while these were not individually significant, overall
a family index of all these measures increase 0.23 standard deviations (significant at the 1%
level using conventional thresholds and at the 5% level after we adjust for eight outcomes
). Furthermore, Figure 1 shows that the improved well-being from the entrepreneurship
program is also (statistically) significantly greater than the modest, insignificant benefits of
the job offer.

5.6

Impacts on indirect outcome families

In Table 11, we see no statistically significant changes in our secondary measures, which
include firm attitudes (e.g. whether firms pay fair wages, or respect worker rights); social
integration (including family, social, and community connectedness and trust); autonomy
48
We piloted several standard depression and anxiety questionnaires to determine what appeared to work
best in our population, in part by ease of respondent understanding and in part by high levels of withinscale intercorrelations. For depression we use the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), a nine-item scale
incorporating depression diagnostic criteria (Martin et al., 2006). To evaluate clinical anxiety and stress, we
use the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), a seven-item scale (Spitzer et al., 2006).

35

(including financial independence and freedom from coercion in the household); or noncognitive skills (including conscientiousness, self-esteem, and punctuality).
Appendix D.7 describes these measures in more detail, where none of the individual
measures making up these family indices have a statistically significant treatment effect. We
measured them in anticipation of low turnover and substantial effects of the job offer on
occupations and earnings. Given the absence of a large direct effect of factory job offers on
well-being, the absence of indirect effects is unsurprising. It is worth noting, however, that
despite the relatively large effects of a entrepreneurship program on occupational choice and
earnings we see little effect on social integration or empowerment.

5.7

Robustness and sensitivity analysis

Table 12 reports sensitivity analysis for key outcomes. We report: pooled endlines using
randomization inference (Column 2), difference-in-difference effects (Column 3), ITT effects
averaging the 11- and 13-month outcomes (Column 4) and conservative attrition scenarios (Columns 5 to 7).49 We estimate attrition bounds by imputing outcomes for unfound
individuals at different points of the observed outcome distribution, focusing on the cases
that reduce program impacts. For positive outcomes we impute the observed mean plus x
standard deviations of the distribution for the control group, and for the treatment group we
impute the observed treatment mean minus x standard deviations of the distribution., for
x = 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5. These imply large systematic differences between missing treatment
and control members.
In general treatment effects are robust to all specifications. The increase in disability risk
among the job arm, and the increase in income in the entrepreneurship arm, are generally
smaller and less precise under extreme attrition scenarios. The direction of these effects and
the qualitative findings are unchanged, however, even in the worst case scenarios.
Finally, Appendix D.8 reports firm-by-firm treatment effects and illustrates robustness
to omitting one firm at a time. It also shows that effects are similar by gender.

6

Discussion and conclusions

Overall, the results suggest that that industrial firms in Ethiopia paid no better than worker’s
informal alternatives, so that most workers were at best indifferent between these forms of
work. This suggests a formal and informal labor market that was more fluid and competitive
49

The results are also highly robust to clustering standard errors by factory, though this is an unnecessary
adjustment because of the individual-level randomization, and a potentially problematic one given the small
number of clusters.

than expected, at least for the young, unskilled, and capital-poor. When these young people’s
constraints on self-employment were lifted, however, they avoided industrial work and tended
to start small but sustainable microenterprises that had raised their meager incomes by a
third a year later. We see no evidence that entrepreneurship is undesirable or increases
income risk—two of the most common charges levied against self-employment. The existence
of competitive labor markets and subsistence-level industrial jobs would seem innocuous if
not for evidence of adverse health effects of industrial work.

6.1

Why did people take poorly paid, hazardous jobs?

There are only a small number of possible explanations. One is that the severity of the health
risks were not apparent to applicants, or even to active industrial workers themselves, and
so they did not demand a compensating wage differential. A second possibility is a learning
and matching story, where industrial jobs pay a compensating differential (or are otherwise
worthwhile) for some, but that workers need to learn about their own nature or the nature of
the work through the process of working (i.e. learning and matching). A third possibility is
that firms screen and match workers only after they join the firm, promoting good matches
and terminating bad ones. A final possibility is a smoothing shocks story, where industrial
jobs do not pay a compensating differential when informal work is available, but are available
during informal unemployment spells and other shocks. All but the last one require some
kind of imperfect information.
We do not have the data or research design to test these alternatives formally. Eight
cohorts in five firms do not offer enough variation or statistical power to conduct a formal
analysis, especially when the relevant number of firm and environmental factors exceeds the
number of cohorts.
Nonetheless, a combination of manager and worker interviews, patterns of treatment
effects, and analysis of worker reports suggest that firms seldom screened, and workers generally understood the health risks, but that they took jobs anyways, often temporarily, to
smooth consumption or to learn their fit with the position.
Imperfect information about health risks
We do not have baseline data on expectations of health risks. But, as reported in Table 10
above, we asked the sample to describe their workplace conditions at endline. Factory and
commercial farm workers were significantly more likely to see their workplace as risky and
in need of greater safety protection than provided.
We see no evidence that people updated their beliefs about the harmfulness of factory
39

work as a result of the treatment, however. The “attitudes to firms” index in Table 11
includes one health-related attitudinal question: whether “factories provide an environment
that will not cause injuries or longer term health problems”. On a 0 to 4 scale, the control
group reported 1.99 on average. The ITT coefficient (and standard deviation) on the job offer
was just 0.16 (0.10), and the CATE for months in formal work was 0.05 (.034). If workers
learned of risks on the job, we would have expected a larger and more robust estimate.
Screening and matching
We can eliminate the screening and matching explanation simply based on how the firms
appear to function. In models by Jovanovic (1979) and others, labor turnover is driven by
imperfect information, as firms only learn about workers and their match quality (productivity) by hiring them. Workers apply where they may be a poor match, and firms hire more
workers than needed. Employers reward good matches with higher wages or promotions and
fire the others. If there are regulatory or other barriers to firing, then poor matches could be
offered lower wages or unpleasant working conditions in the hopes they quit. One prediction
would be a tenure premium: a steep earnings-experience relationship, not due to any direct
causality in the form of experience leading to higher productivity and earnings, but rather
from a correlation as those who are observed to stay in the firm for longer are the better,
more productive matches for these industrial jobs.
We see little evidence in Ethiopia to suggest this screening mechanism explains our findings. In the five firms we worked with (and the many other firms we interviewed as candidates) none of the management described screening employees in this way. There was
typically limited room for advancement, especially for women who made up the majority of
our sample. There were also few regulatory barriers to firing workers. In general, firm managers were puzzled and dismayed by the high levels of turnover, and would have preferred
to see all of the applicants stay.
The managers we interviewed also made efforts to add non-wage benefits, such as offering
free transport, free clinics, and in some cases a free meal at a canteen. They appeared less
likely to raise wages, however, and indeed often failed to keep pace with inflation and keep
real wages constant. The reasons for not paying higher wages were hard to discern, and
we gained a range of impressions from the many firms we interviewed: a belief that higher
wages would not be profit-maximizing; a belief they might be but cash flow problems at the
firm level made a higher wage bill impossible; and a tendency to money illusion, or thinking
about wages in nominal terms and failing to keep pace with inflation.50
50

Indeed, even the authors succumbed to this money illusion, initially failing to keep survey enumerator
wages in pace with inflation until a correction was made after high quit rates and complaints.

40

We do see a slight rising wage profile over time among the workers who stayed in industrial
jobs, but the gains are not dramatic. In Appendix D.9 we regress endline earnings on a
Mincerian-style set of baseline covariates, including of age, gender, health, education, and
work experience. In no instance is prior industrial experience associated with higher earnings,
and tenure with the firm is only weakly associated with a rise in earnings. Given that we do
not observe any screening or involuntary separations in practice, this modestly rising wage
profile likely reflects self-selection and rising productivity more than screening.
Shocks
The patterns we observe could reflect attempts to smooth consumption in response to shocks
or changing needs by changing labor allocation, such as in models of added worker effects
and other labor market responses to shocks(Lundberg, 1985; Morduch, 1995).
It is worth noting that nearly all of the applicants we interviewed described industrial
jobs as temporary in the sense that they did not expect to work there for more than a
few years. For example, women commonly explained that they only planned to work in
the formal sector for only a few years, until they had children and took on child-rearing,
household occupations, and more flexible part-time self-employment. Many young people,
perhaps even a majority, also expressed a preference for one day running their own businesses.
Formal sector jobs were temporary jobs while they accumulated enough savings to start an
enterprise. Among those who did see a career in the formal sector, they commonly saw
the factory as a stepping stone to white-collar or other non-industrial employment. These
patterns are largely consistent with recent labor market studies and ethnographic work in
Ethiopia, which find that higher paid white collar jobs are preferred and that roughly half of
factory workers are dissatisfied with their job (Mains, 2012; Franklin, 2014). Recent panel
studies of young adults with some secondary education suggest that young people typically
take temporary, often unsatisfactory work, in different places, varying from week to week.
Few can afford to be completely unemployed for long stretches, and rely on family networks
for short periods before returning to some temporary work, all while searching for higher
quality permanent jobs. Both this survey and ethnographies of youth and work in Ethiopia
stress how longer-term, contractual jobs are prized, especially white collar jobs in the private
and public sector (Mains, 2012). Industrial jobs of the kind we studied appear to belong in
the undesirable rather than the desirable category.
This does not explain the often very short tenure of most of the people offered a job in
a study firm, however, especially since quitters often exited the industrial sector entirely.
Unfortunately we do not have data on pre-application shocks, nor do we have sufficiently
detailed employment histories to distinguish new entrants from recently or long term unem41

ployed. Even if we did, unobserved selection into the experimental sample would cloud any
test.51 Hence sharp tests of the shocks hypothesis are not possible. Nonetheless, there is
some evidence consistent with industrial jobs as a response to temporary shocks.
First, in interviews, some applicants described the factory jobs as undesirable and shortterm occupations while they found more interesting, respectable, or easier work for better
wages. In these accounts, they seemingly understood the poor conditions, difficulty, and low
pay of industrial work, but endured it for a few weeks or months between other, better jobs.
Similarly, a 2012 urban labor market survey found that young workers, especially the
higher-ability and more ambitious ones, churn through multiple jobs, treating them as temporary places to earn money while they search for something better (Franklin, 2014, 2015).
That is, seasonal or short-term but higher-paying informal work is regularly available, and
less desirable jobs (such as industrial work) are used in the interim.
Indeed, as described in Section 5, the average job applicant had other, largely informal
employment opportunities that paid similar wages with fewer disamenities. And when the
grant was offered, giving people marginally more earnings in informal self-employment, the
percentage of people working in an any industrial job at endline halved, from 20% in the
control group to 9% in the entrepreneurship arm.
Not all the evidence is consistent with this view, however. If shocks are influential,
we might expect applicants with more liquid wealth to leave more quickly. But we see
no heterogeneity in length of stay in the industrial job by baseline household assets (see
Appendix D.10). Moreover, people commonly quit despite having no other full-time work
opportunity, instead entering a spell of unemployment. As young people who commonly lived
with their parents or a husband, they did not necessarily need to work full time, and given
the low wage and demanding work many said they preferred to stop working full time and do
petty jobs while searching for better full time employment. This is a common employment
search strategy in Ethiopia. Hence shocks are probably only a partial explanation for the
short tenure we observe.
Learning and matching
The final possibility is akin to the imperfect information and matching case of Jovanovic
(1979), but in this case the workers are the ones learning about the job. That is, a job is
an “experience good”, in that its full characteristics are only revealed to the worker when
taking it on. While workers know the wage in advance, they do not know the non-wage
characteristics, including how hard they have to work, the working conditions and other
51

For instance, we cannot easily distinguish between an adverse shock due to chance or unobserved characteristics of the worker, such as motivation and other factors that affect outside options.

42

features (Nelson, 1970). As our sample is young and has little formal labor market experience,
and since the sector is fairly young, applicants many not know their affinity for the work or
the risks or disamenities in advance, and so they learn by doing. They quit if they discover
the job was a poor match for them given wage levels and their opportunity cost. Recent
models of this type include Antonovics and Golan (2012); Papageorgiou (2014); Gervais et al.
(2014).
Again, due to unobserved selection into the experimental sample, it is not possible to test
this interpretation rigorously.52 However, much of the qualitative evidence, along with labor
market surveys, are consistent with this theory. For 81% of applicants, this was their first
industrial job (indeed, for most it was their first formal sector job). We do not have data on
pre-application expectations of the posts. But in both exit and qualitative interviews, some
people reported they had little sense of the nature or difficulty of the work, or the hazards
involved a priori.53
Other applicants did say they had some information about the quality of the jobs in
advance, from friends and neighbors, and that they expected the jobs to be unpleasant. But
they said they underestimated the disamenities, or how little the pay were once they factored
in the inflexibility of the work, transport time and costs, or the physical demands and risks.
In both cases they tried out the job but left if the workload and disamenities were not worth
their expectations for such work. Similar points are echoed by subjects in a weekly panel
survey of young job searchers in the capital over the course of a year (Franklin, 2015).
Finally, recall that quitters did not not simply switch industrial jobs. Rather, they tended
to exit the industrial sector entirely, suggesting they realized their poor fit. Hence, there
is suggestive evidence for learning and matching on the part of workers contributing to the
high turnover rates observed.

6.2

Generalizability

If we want to extrapolate to the case of Ethiopia, it is important to note our five firms were
largely domestically and foreign owned exporters, sought out low-skilled and inexperienced
employees, and paid below average wages but at not exceptional levels for firms in these
particular labor-intensive sectors. In this light, at best we have estimated local average
52

For instance, it’s not clear what we should predict if an applicant had prior industrial experience. Should
they stay a shorter time because they learn more quickly? Or are they a good match for unobserved reasons
and are likely to stay?
53
Applicants with prior industrial experience should have some sense of the job. Yet in Appendix D.9 we
see that prior industrial experience was associated with lower endline earnings and higher turnover. Rather
than being better matches, these could be people who were poor matches with industrial jobs who took the
work because of adverse shocks. It is such a self-selected sample, we hesitate to infer much from the patterns.

43

treatment effects on young, entry-level workers to firms with large number of lower-skill jobs
where employees are, in practice, interchangeable, and the labor market is not evidently
segmented. They are in firms in sectors attracting considerable FDI, and seen as a future
for this country and its labor force.
Clearly there are limits to what we can learn from five firms. It’s conceivable that industrial labor markets in other countries, or higher-skill industries, are more segmented. Even so,
it’s worth noting that the patterns we observe—low wages and high rates of turnover—have
been relatively common features of industrial jobs from modern day higher-skill Chinese
manufacturing to industrialization in the US or UK as recently as a century ago. Hence our
firms and worker experiences may not be so exceptional.
For instance, one study of turnover at an Apple supplier in eastern China found that
92% of workers leave within six months of hire, and weekly rates of exit average about 7%
(Cohen et al., 2015).54 Another example comes from Jordan, where Groh et al. (2014) not
only show that it is difficult to create matches between employers and workers searching for
work, but that a majority of workers quit their “successful matches” within a few months.
It’s not clear whether these represent churn across sectors or within the industrial sector,
and within-sector churn is undoubtedly part of the activity.
There is substantial historical evidence of cross-sector churn and industrial exit in the
West. For instance, Beckert (2014), looking at early textile development, found high turnover
and exit to be the norm from Barcelona to Liverpool to New England. For example, he writes:
“The Dover Manufacturing Company in Dover, New Hampshire, had to employ a total of 342
workers in the period from August 1823 to Oct 1824 just to maintain an average workforce
of approximately 140. . . . Entering the factory for a few weeks, they would leave once they
had made enough money to hold them over to the selling of their crops or when their labor
was needed on the farm.”
Similarly, Montgomery (1989) and Kaufman (2008) note how, between 1900 and 1920,
US companies became aware of (and obsessed with) high turnover. In 1913 turnover at
Ford Motor Company was 370%, and General Electric had turnover rates exceeding 100%
in its plants. While the revolution in scientific management, or “Taylorism”, is often associated with increasing productivity, reducing employee turnover was actually its initial focus.
Increased screening was one of the innovations introduced.
The point is that high turnover (within and across sectors) is a historically common
feature of manufacturing. The features of our Ethiopian case—low industrial wages and
54

A poll of Chinese workers and firms found that over 40% of employees stayed at their previous companies
for just one to two years, and only 38% of polled firms had prepared strategies to retain their workers even
though nearly all said they were aware of the negative impact of turnover (Hays PLC, 2012).

44

high sectoral turnover—could be influenced by the fact that the country is still at an early
stage of industrialization, with relatively few manufacturers competing for workers. Low
wages and high turnover could also be driven by poor personnel management. The story of
US manufacturing above is one of innovation in management practice. Ethiopian firms may
have yet to adopt and adapt these innovations.
To answer the question of generalizability requires replication, especially in countries at
different stages of industrialization, or where the degree of industrialization and competition
for labor varies over time. The openness of so many firms to participate in the study suggests
replication elsewhere is possible.

6.3

Implications

However unattractive these jobs are to the majority of workers, we do not conclude that
Africa needs fewer low-wage manufacturers. As we saw, these jobs paid more than the
alternatives available to a substantial fraction of workers. Moreover, advocates such as Paul
Krugman (1997) have argued that poor countries need more sweatshops not because they
pay wage premiums, but rather because worker wages should rise as more and more firms
begin to compete for a increasingly smaller pool of experienced workers, and as firms begin
to adopt more technologically advanced production that is complementary to human capital.
If so, wages would rise in general, in the informal as well as formal sector, and we would not
expect an experiment such as ours to yield treatment effects on income.
Even so, the adverse health effects suggest an important role for information or regulation,
especially if workers face these risks uninformed, or are time-inconsistent in their choices over
short-term gains at long-term costs. For instance, the government or firms could begin to
offer disability insurance, insist that firms communicate risks more clearly, or identify and
limit the use of the most hazardous chemicals.
Regulation, of course, risks raising labor costs and benefiting insiders at the expense of
outsiders. An important direction for more research is the costs and benefits of regulation.
An important example is Harrison and Scorse (2010), who show that anti-sweatshop activists
campaigns in Indonesia led to large real wage increases in targeted enterprises, with some
costs in terms of reduced investment, falling profits, and increased probability of closure for
smaller plants, but no adverse employment effects.
Understanding better why firms do not try to combat high turnover, for example through
paying efficiency wages, may also lead to better and more efficient outcomes, especially if
the low wages being paid are suboptimal. It is possible that formal and informal firms alike
are poorly managed, or that the sector is constrained in unobserved ways. But it is also

45

possible that, in very unskilled industries, high turnover at very low wages, where workers
with the poorest outside options remain, is the profit-maximizing choice. The efficacy of
management and the take-up and effectiveness of modern human resource practices in the
firm is an important but unexplored area of research.
