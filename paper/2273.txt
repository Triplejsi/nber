The Impact of Firm Acquisitions on Labor

ABSTRACT

In this paper, we investigate the changes in wages and employment following a firm's
involvement in an acquisition, compared with firms not involved in acquisitions. Contrary to the

tenor of popular press coverage of acquisitions, which focuses on hostile takeovers of large
firms, we find small (and sometimes positive) changes in wages and employment following an
acquisition.

THE IMPACT OF FIRM ACQUISITIONS ON LABOR

Charles Brown and James L. Medoff

The impact of firm acquisitions on the value of both the acquiring and acquired firm has
been the subject of a large and growing body of research (see, e.g., in this volume, Asquith,
Bruner, and Mullins; Franks, Harris, and Mayer; Hal!; and Ruback). However, there are no similar

systematic investigations of the impact of such acquisitions on labor. Lack of concern about how

labor fares in such situations cannot be the reason for the absence of statistical analysis of this
question: indeed, the popular press (and, presumably, its readers) are fascinated by such impacts.

The public's perception is conditioned by a relatively small number of highly publicized and
extremely hostile takeovers. What comes to mind immediately is Carl lcahn, Frank Lorenzo, and

the airline industry. There was also widespread coverage of the extensive job loss
—— estimated at 25,000 jobs —— associated with takeover attempts made on two major food
store chains —— Safeway Stores and Lucky Stores.

Organized labor has explicitly stated its concern that such takeovers are bad for workers:

Workers and their unions have a vital interest in the corporate takeover issue. Corporate
mergers, takeovers, and leveraged buy—outs often have serious effects on jobs, wages,
and working conditions. (AFL—CIO, 1987, p. El)

The general public is similarly concerned. A recent survey by Louis Harris and Associates

revealed that 58 percent of the population believes that hostile takeovers do more harm than
good. Moreover, when asked which one group they thought ought to be protected most from
being hurt in a hostile takeover, 63 percent said "employees" (Louis Harris and Associates,

1987).
Despite these fears, it is not obvious that acquisitions necessarily harm wages and

employment One reason for being skeptical about any widespread injury to workers from
acquisitions is the highly unrepresentative set of takeovers which have received the most
publicity.

The uncertain nature of any relationship between acquisitions and the interest of labor is

clearer when the motives for such acquisitions are considered. First, acquisitions may occur
because of differences in opinion, with the buyer thinking the acquisition more valuable than the
seller. Second, acquisitions may occur because a group outside the firm believes it can manage
it more efficiently than current management (Jensen, 1 984). Third, acquisitions may occur
because the sale may permit the abrogation of rules governing employment and earnings at
smaller morale/reputation costs (Shleifer and Summers, in this volume).

The first possible reason for an acquisition does not imply impending disaster for labor: to

the contrary, if the acquiring optimist is correct, increased prosperity for workers might be just
around the corner. The second reason also need not be a harbinger of bad times: better
management might lead to more and better jobs. This is particularly true if the new managers

have better access to capital markets for expanding the operation. The third reason can be

expected to be associated with worse conditions f or workers. While these worse conditions are
usually blamed on the acquiring owners/managers, they typically reflect some significant change

in market conditions, like deregulation in the airline industry. Indeed, if the acquisition shocks the
workers into accepting changes in work rules, employment and wages could actually be improved
by the acquisition.

When the dust settles, does labor win or lose from the typical acquisition? In particular,
what happens to wages and employment? In this paper, we address these questions. To do so,
we use data on the employment and wages of firms in Michigan compiled from Unemployment
Insurance (ES202) records by the Michigan Employment Security Commission. The MESC data file
has several advantages —— consistent longitudinal data for six and one—half years (1978:111—

1 984:IV), inclusion of small firms likely to be absent from other data files, and identification of
acquisitions as part of the bookkeeping needed to run the UI system. Its disadvantages are the

result of its being a single state's data —— Michigan is not representative of the entire U.S., we
do not see what is happening to the non—Michigan part of multi—state companies, and we have

relatively few of the mega—acquisitions which currently dominate public attention. We also

3

cannot distinguish between friendly and hostile takeovers. Hence, our findings apply to
acquisitions in general, and not necessarily to hostile takeovers.

In Section I we describe the data in greater detail. Our twin goals here are to clarify the
issues which arise in distinguishing between mergers and other sorts of acquisitions, and to give

an overview of the characteristics of firms which were and were not involved in acquisitions. In
Section II, we describe our methods of analysis. In Sections III and IV, we use the data to
measure the impact of mergers on wages and employment. In the case of mergers, post—merger
wages and employment are compared to wages and employment of the two partners taken

together. The longitudinal data allow us several years of pre—acquisition information to serve as
a base for the analysis, and several years of subsequent data to go beyond very—short—term
impacts. In general, we find small (and sometimes positive) changes in wages and employment

following an acquisition. In Section V we summarize our findings and discuss options for future
work.

I. MESC Data

The file of MESC records available at the Institute for Social Research at the University of
Michigan includes data on over 200,000 firms over the period 1978:111 through 1984:IV.'
Employment data are monthly, and total payroll (not UI—taxable payroll) data are quarterly. As part

of the normal bookkeeping of the UI system, MESC identifies situations in which the assets of

one firm (a 'predecessor") are acquired by another (a "successor"). The file used in this paper
does not include predecessors as separate firms, but includes predecessor employment and

payroll prior to the acquisition in separate "predecessor" fields on the successor firm's
longitudinal record. 2

In thinking about the impact of acquisitions on employment and wages, it is important to

distinguish among several different types of acquisitions:
(1)

Firm A changes ownership without being integrated with any other firm.

(2)

Firm A purchases the assets of Firm B without absorbing its workforce.

(3)

Firm A purchases Firm B and (at least initially) absorbs (most of) Firm B's workers or
Firm A and Firm B combine to form Firm C. and (at least initially) Firm C includes

(most of) the workers of Firms A and B.
The key to distinguishing among these types of acquisitions is the pattern of predecessor
P and successor S employment over time. Let T be the period of the acquisition, the last period

in which P is positive. In situation (1), we would observe this pattern:

Finally, mergers (situation 3)——at least mergers of two firms doing business in
Michigan——should generate this pattern.

Unless employment is growing or fluctuating significantly, s1 1 should approximately equal

Compared to an ideal classification, there are three problems classifying acquisitions in
these data. First, we have no information on mergers between in— and out—of—state firms.

When an in—state firm is acquired by an out—of—state firm, there will be no record of the

successor prior to the acquisition, so it will look like a type 1 acquisition. Conversely, when an
out—of—state firm is acquired by an in—state firm, there is no record of the merger at all.
The second problem lies in distinguishing between acquisitions where the workers of the
predecessor are acquired from those in which they are not. The only evidence to distinguish
between cases (2) and (3) is whether ST+l

and/or T is small, it will be hard to identify true mergers. To see this, consider this record:

Successor Employment

One interpretation is that the two firms merged in month 1, creating a firm with 1 11 employees,

all but one of whom was employed in the next month. The other interpretation is that the

6

successor expanded by 3 workers at the same time it acquired the assets (but not the employees)

of the predecessor.
In the tables below, we identify as type 3 acquisitions or "mergers" those records which
have positive successor employment prior to T and
5T+1 — (ST +
(a)

> —0.50 or equivalently

STl — S1

> 0.50

(b)

Condition (a) says the successor must grow by at least 50 percent of the predecessor's
employment. Condition (b) requires that the predecessor be large enough that (a) be practically

meaningfuL. Conditions like these are needed if artificial inflation of the merger count is to be

avoided. The particular cutoffs are, to be sure, arbitrary.
A third problem is that the predecessor—successor relationship applies to reorganizations
as. well as acquisitions. It is difficult to distinguish such reorganizations from type 1 acquisitions

(simple sales), since the pattern of predecessor and successor employment would be exactly the

same. However, a "type of business" (e.g., proprietorship, partnership, corporation) field is
available, and we can distinguish cases where the type of business changes. We call cases
which otherwise look like simple sales but show a change in the type of business code

"reorganizations." The distinction between "simple sales" and "reorganizations" is not as clean
as we would like, since some restructuring does not involve a change of business type while
some sales are accompanied by such a change.

To summarize, type 1 acquisitions are those for which there is no successor employment

prior to T, and for which the "type of business" remains the same. Type 2 acquisitions are those
for which there is positive successor employment prior to T, but which do not satisfy the two
conditions (a) and (b) in the previous paragraph. Type 3 acquisitions are those for which there is
positive successor employment prior to T, and which do satisfy those conditions. We will
sometimes refer to types 1, 2, and 3 as "simple sales", "assets only" and "mergers",
respectively. We treat "reorganizations" as a separate category, though they are not our primary

7

focus. We ignore those acquisitions which occurred in 1978 or 1984:4, because there is too
little predecessor or successor data for these acquisitions.
Given that acquisitions——and especially mergers——are fairly rare events but the MESC

file is enormous, we constructed an "extract file" consisting of all firms with non—zero

predecessor fields and a 20 percent sample of other firms. Most of our analysis, however, is
based on a smaller file, consisting of observations which had relatively complete data. More

specifically, an observation was included in the 'clean data file" only if there was some
employment and payroll data in each year.

An overview of the extract file and the clean data file is presented in Table 1. Two
features of the table are striking. First, even remembering that the "no predecessor" cases
represent a 20 percent subsample, the frequency of "reorganizations" compared to no

predecessor firms over the six years 1979—84 is striking. (We also found the frequency of
type 2 (assets only) acquisitions surprisingly high.) The second striking feature of the table is
that the clean—data file is so much smaller than the complete extract There are two reasons

for this. First, birth and death rates of firms are quite high, and they show up as "missing" data
in the years before a birth or after a death. Connor, Heeringa, and Jackson (1985) note that both
- births and deaths are very common in these data. We will have a little to say about deaths later
in the paper. Second, there is some missing data, though its impact is somewhat reduced by

eliminating only observations for which the data are missing f or an entire year.

Table 2 divides the extract and clean—data files by broad industry. The distribution of
observations in the two files is quite similar, with the clean—data file having proportionally

fewer construction and more manufacturing firms than the extract file from which it was derived.
The three types of acquisitions are also spread broadly across industries.

Table 3 shows the average level of employment by type of acquisition in the two files.
Our employment variable includes the employment of both partners in cases where an acquisition

occurs. The mean value for 1978 excludes those cases in the extract file where employment in

8
1978 is zero (missing); the mean value f or 1984 similarly excludes observations with zero
(missing) 1984 employment.

The comparison between the mean levels of employment in the extract file and the clean—

data file show that average firm size is larger in the latter. This is exactly what one would
expect, because births and deaths are more important for small firms than for large ones.
Comparing number of firms and mean employment by type of acquisition brings out an important

and less obvious fact While the average size of firms in type 1 acquisitions is small (17
workers using 1984 figures from the extract file), there are many such firms. Type 2 firms are
larger, but there are proportionately fewer of them. Type 3 acquisitions (mergers) involve still

larger firms, but again there are far fewer of them. Overall, using 1984 figures from the
extract file, there are roughly 85,000 workers employed in firms which were involved in type 1

acquisitions, 26 5.000 workers for type 2, and 115,000 workers involved in type 3 acquisitions
(mergers). After taking account of the fact that the "no predecessor" firms in Table 3 are a 20
percent sample. we calculate that roughly 3, 9, and 4 percent of workers in Michigan worked for
firms involved in the three types of acquisitions in this period.
Finally, Table 4 presents information about the size of the predecessor and successor
firms, measured three months before the acquisition, and the combined entity immediately

afterward. Three conclusions stand out First, the predecessor in type 1 and type 2 acquisitions
are small (averaging 20 and 11 workers, respectively), while the acquired firm in type 3
acquisitions ("mergers") is on average medium sized (78 workers). Second, as one might expect,

the successor (acquiring firm) is typically larger than the predecessor. Third, on average type 2
successors do not grow (S.1.÷.1 ST=—2) despite acquiring the assets of predecessors with an

average of 11 workers, while type 3 successors grow by nearly all of the acquired firm (ST+

r

S.r=79 compared to P1=78). In part, this last contrast follows from the definition of type 2 and
type 3 acquisitions, but it is sharper than one might guessed on purely definitional grounds.

9
II. Method of Analysis
In order to determine the relationship between changes in ownership and wages and

employment, we will compare firms involved in acquisitions in year T with the much larger set of
firms which were not involved in any acquisitions (i.e., had zero predecessor employment)

throughout the sample period.' Our "wage" equation is

In WT+. =

B

B

(1)

t=1978 a.ln Et + t=1978

W +

k=1

where W is the payroll per worker (per month), E is employment (averaged over all months where

positive employment is reported), B is a "base year' either one or two years prior to T, and

is

a dummy variable which equals one when the firm is involved in a type k acquisition (k= 1,2,3) or

reorganization (k=4) in year T, and zero otherwise. Not shown explicitly in equation (1) are 1—
digit industry dummy variables, which are added to each equation. For each acquisition year 1,

separate equations are estimated for each year T+j, f or j=O through T+j= 1 984 (e.g., for

T=1981 we have four equations, one for each of the years 198 1—84).
Our employment equation is slightly more complicated:

Wk=1+ kY +

where E is the firm's average employment in the years prior to the merger. Interacting Dk with
means that the impact of the various types of acquisitions is proportional to the pre—merger

level of employment, rather than being a fixed number of workers for all firm sizes.' We
weight the observations to produce a homoskedastic error term. We use E rather than In E as
our dependent variable because it allows us to consider (in Section IV) the impact of adding to the

clean data sample those firms which appear to have "died" after year 1, by treating them as

having E=O.

10

The ideas underlying these equations are borrowed from the literature which evaluates the
impact of employment—training programs on individuals' earnings and employment (e.g., Bloch

1979). Holding constant the history of the firm prior to 1, we ask whether firms involved in
changes of ownership had significantly different wages (or employment) j years thereafter.

Using T— 1 as the base year is the lnatural? choice in our framework. The choice of year
T—2 is motivated by the possibility that firms involved in mergers in year T were subject to
unusual transitory shocks in the previous year, from which they would anyway recover. Using T—
2 as the base year ignores those shocks in predicting outcomes in T+j, and so essentially treats
the T— 1 shock as transitory (Ashenfelter, 1978).

In the results reported in the next section, we study (separately) firms involved in
acquisitions in 1981 and in 1982. These middle—of—sample years were chosen to ensure
several years of data after T (to evaluate consequences of acquisitions) and several years prior

to T (so that we can control accurately for prior conditions). In each case, our "control group"

consists of firms not involved in an acquisition at y point between 1978 and 1984: we exclude
altogether those firms which were involved in acquisitions in one of the other years.

11

Ill. Wage Equations
The key results from estimating equation (1) for T= 1981 are presented in Table 5. The

top half of the table uses 1980 as the base year, while the bottom half uses 1979. Each
column of the table corresponds to a different years employment being predicted. Only the

coefficients of the four dummy variables are reported, though each set of four coefficients
comes from a (separate) equation with lagged wages and employment and the industry dummy
varibles included.

The choice of base year makes little difference to the results, and so our discussion will
focus on the equations with 1 980 as the base year. In the three years after the acquisition (i.e.,
1982—84), wages at firms involved in type I acquisitions ("simple sales") average about four
percent lower than one would otherwise predict from their pre— 1981 wages and employment
Similarly, wages are about 5 percent higher in firms involved in type 2 ("assets only) acquisitions.
Firms involved in mergers have wages about 5 percent lower than we estimate they otherwise

would be. However, in contrast to the previous coefficients, the standard errors of these

estimates are sizeable. It is worth emphasizing that these latter results refer to average wages
of the post—merger firm, controlling for the (weighted average of) pre—merger wages at both
the predecessor and successor.

Analogous results f or 1982 acquisitions are presented in Table 6. While the "control
group" in Tables 5 and 6 are the same, the firms involved in acquisitions are completely

different, so that Table 6 is a nearly independent replication. The most important difference is
that the coefficient of 03 is now tiny (averaging — 1.5 percent for 1983—84).
We also re—estimated equation (1), restricting the sample to firms employing at least 50

workers. Overall, the coefficients were similar to those in Tables 5 and 6, but somewhat
smaller. They averaged —1, 0, and —2 percent for types 1, 2, and 3 acquisitions, respectively.
Overall, we conclude that the impact of acquisitions on wages in our sample is small.

12

IV. Employment Equations

The results of estimating equation (2) for 1= 1 88 1 are summarized in Table 7. Once

again, the choice of base year——1980 (top half of table) or 1979 (bottom half)—— has little

effect on the results, and we focus on the coefficients from the 1980 base year equations.
Firms experiencing a "simple sale" in 1981 had employment in 1982—84 which was about
3 percent higher than one would otherwise have predicted. Those involved in "assets only"
acquisitions had employment which was about 5 percent lower. The employment of firms which

merged is indistinguishably different from what we estimate it would have been in the absence of
the merger.

Analogous results f or 1982 acquisitions are in Table 8. Unfortunately, there are
appreciable differences between the coefficients in Table 8 and those in Table 7. The impact of
a simple sale is now 1 5 percent (rather than 3 percent), and the impacts of the other two types
of acquisitions are also a bit larger (—6 percent and 3 percent, respectively) when one averages

over the two post—acquisition years (1983 and 1984). Moreover, the merger effects (the
coefficients of D3) are sensitive to choice of base year, reaching 8 percent when 1 980 rather
than 1981 is the base.
This instability across years——and the fact that the results were also sensitive to
whether we specified the equation as logarithmic, linear, or (as in Table 7 and 8) weighted
linear——makes us less confident about these results than the wage results in Tables 5 and 6.
Averaging across base years and across the two tables, the three employment impacts are
roughly 9 percent (simple sales), —5 percent (assets only), and 2 percent (mergers).

As noted in Section 1, our results use a sample of firms which reported wages and

employment in each year. Thus, firms are deleted if they were "born" or "died" during the sample

period, or if for some reason a whole year's data are missing. In order to explore the
consequences of deleting "deaths" from the sample, we considered a slightly different sample—

inclusion criterion. We reran our analysis of employment of firms involved in 198 1 acquisitions
(Table 7), including firms which reported firms which reported zero employment in 1 982 or 1 983

13

through 1 984 (i.e., which disappeared for at least two years after 198 1 and did not reappear).
Even though this loosening increased the sample considerably (from about 1 7,000 to about

20,000), the coefficients of our acquisition dummies did not change appreciably. The largest
change was f or 03. whose coefficient moved from zero (averaging 1982—84, top half of Table
7) to 3 percent with the expanded sample.

14

V. Conclusions

Based on our analysis of the MESC data, we find that: (1) Firms which are part of 'simple
sales" have post—sale wages which are about 5 percent tower than they would otherwise be, but

employment roughly 9 percent higher. (2) Firms which are part of 'assets only' acquisitions''
have wages which are about 5 percent higher than they would otherwise have been, but

employment about 5 percent lower. (3) Mergers are associated with wage declines of about 4
percent. and employment growth of about 2 percent.

In thinking about these results, two qualifications are important. First. as we noted in
Section 4. the estimated employment impacts are sensitive to which year's acquisitions we study,

and other specification details. Second, our wage measure is average payroll per worker, and

will deviate from a more ideal wage measure if the composition of the workforce is changing. In
particular. if (as is usually the case) newly hired workers earn less than those already employed,

our wage changes will tend to be negatively related to employment changes. The fact that the

effect of each type of acquisition on wages is opposite in sign from its effect on employment is
consistent with this interpretation. The estimated effects of mergers on wages are also subject

to a different composition effect if the (relatively high paid) head of the acquired firm leaves
following the merger, average wages will fall. Given the small size of our typical firms, a non—
trivial share of our estimated wage decline from mergers may be due to such compositional

effects.
At this early stage of our research, is difficult to be certain whether these patterns are
consequences or merely correlates of the acquisitions. But, at least in our sample, the common
public perception of acquisitions providing the occasion to slash wages and/or employment finds

little support

Notes

For a description of the construction, characteristics, and availability of this file, see Corinor,
Converse. Heeringa, and Jackson (1 984).

2 Predecessor data are aggregated in the relatively rare case of multiple predecessors. Thus,

if firm A acquires firm B and later firm C, the predecessor field on A's record includes the sum
of B and C's employment and payroll up to the time when B is acquired, and then only C's
employment and payroll until C is acquired. After C is acquired, succeeding months (quarters')
employment (payroll) data are blank.

In the case where the two firms form a new firm, which firm is called the successor is. for
our purposes. arbitrary.

In scanning the raw data, we noticed that in some cases P fell and S rose just before P

became zero. If P in month T was less than half of its value three months earlier, we used P and
S in month T—3 instead of month T in the above tests. This led to a slight increase in the
number of type 3 cases, and a corresponding reduction in the number of type 2 cases.

s Even with the relatively conservative definition of type 3 acquisitions and therefore relatively

broad definition of type 2 acquisitions, 20 percent of the type 2 firms in the 'clean—data" file

had T+ 1 exactly equal to S.., and another 20 percent had ST+ 1<S1 So the phenomenon of
acquiring the assets but not the workers of the predecessor appears to be real.

To simplify notation, we suppress a subscript for individual firms. But our unit of observation

is, of course, firms.
' We estimated the unweighted equation, and then regressed the absolute error on a constant

term and pre—merger employment We found that both coefficients were consistently positive,
suggesting that the error variance increased, but less than proportionately, with the size of the

firm.
We also interacted the industry dummies with .
' One could, of course, hold constant employment and wages through year T+j— 1 in the

equation with year T+j as dependent variable, but that significantly complicates the interpretation

26

of the results. With that specification, the impact of, say, 0k on In W1 1 would depend on the

coefficient of

in that years equation pjy the indirect effects of

effect of In WT on In WT+ 1 and of

on In ET times the effect of In

on In W1 times the
on In WT+ 1•

1 0 One might expect that wages of the post—merger firm would move toward the wages of the
pre—merger successor, since the successor has acquired the predecessor. We added a term

reflecting the difference in In—wages between predecessor and successor to the equation (1)

specification. but it was never significant Basically, we can't tell whether our conjecture is true,
given the limited number of mergers in the data.

' Recall that this category includes mergers involving tiny predecessors, as well as cases
where the predecessors workforce is not acquired.
