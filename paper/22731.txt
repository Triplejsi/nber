Will the Paris Accord Accelerate Climate Change?

ABSTRACT
The 2015 Paris Accord is meant to control our planet’s rising temperature. But it may be doing
the opposite in gradually, rather than immediately reducing CO2 emissions. The Accord
effectively tells dirty-energy producers to "use it or lose it." This may be accelerating their
extraction and burning of fossil fuels and, thereby, be permanently raising temperatures.
Our paper uses a simple OLG model to illustrate this long-noted Green Paradox. Its framework
treats climate damage as a negative externality imposed by today’s generations on tomorrow’s –
an externality that is, in part, irreversible and can tip the climate to permanently higher
temperatures. In our model, delaying abatement can lead to larger changes in climate than doing
nothing, reducing welfare for all generations. In contrast, immediate policy action can raise
welfare for all generations.
Finally we question the standard use of infinitely-lived, single-agent models, which assume,
unrealistically, intergenerational altruism in determining optimal abatement policy. Their
prescriptions can differ, potentially dramatically, from those needed to correct the negative
climate externality today’s generations are imposing on tomorrow’s.

Introduction

In the 2015 Paris Accord, 195 countries agreed to limit the planet’s temperature
rise to 2℃ above pre-industrial levels. The Accord calls for moderate measures
through 2025 and tougher measures thereafter. The Accord includes neither an
enforcement mechanism nor any compliance deadlines. Consequently, the Accord
represents a voluntary arrangement that countries may fail to honor until they
have been identified and called to account, both of which can take time. The
Accord did accomplish one thing. It sent dirty-energy producers a clear message
that their days are number.
This use it or lose it message – that reserves of oil, natural gas, and coal
will become stranded assets – may be accelerating fossil fuel extraction and CO2
emissions. Since 2010, global oil production has risen by 10 percent,1 global coal
production by 9 percent,2 and global natural gas production by 11 percent.3 Yet
slower, not quicker release of CO2 is critical to limiting the planet’s temperature
rise. Hence, the Paris accord, in not mandating immediate emission-limitation
policy, may actually be accelerating climate change. This is Sinn (2008)’s well
known Green Paradox.
This paper illustrates the Green Paradox arising from delaying climate change
policy. Our vehicle is a two-period OLG model featuring dirty and clean energy.
Dirty energy, referenced as oil, is exhaustible and in inelastic supply. Clean energy,
referenced as solar, eventually supplies all energy needs but, depending on policy,
this outcome may, paradoxically, occur too soon to prevent irreversible climate
damage. Indeed, the earlier solar takes over, the worse matters can be for the
climate.
The life-cycle model is the appropriate framework for studying climate policy

since it captures the negative externality current generations impose on future
generations in using fossil fuels. Climate policy’s natural objective is to achieve an
abatement path that makes no generation worse off and at least some generations
better off. The search for such efficient abatement policies moves the climatepolicy debate from the realm of ethics to that of economic efficiency.
Our reference here to ethics alludes to the use of infinite-horizon models in
which optimal climate policy is set based on the infinitely-lived, representative
agent’s time-preference factor. The recent paper by Golosov et al. (2014) is an
example. Its optimal carbon tax formula depends critically on the representative agent’s time-preference rate.4 But Altonji et al. (1992, 1997), Hayashi et al.
(1996), and other studies, particularly Lee and Mason (2011) analyses of the postwar change in the shape of the age-consumption profile, provide strong evidence
against the intergenerational altruism required by single-agent models.
Indeed, were such intergenerational altruism ubiquitous, there would be no
reason to analyze climate change policy. Agents with such preferences would set
optimal climate policy to protect their progeny. This is true even if one considers different clans within a single country or in different countries. As shown in
Kotlikoff (1983) and Bernheim and Bagwell (1988), the assumption of intergenerational altruism combined with the assumption that agents from different clans
become altruistically linked with one another implies effective altruistic linkages
across essentially everyone on the planet. In this case, there is global agreement
on enacting first-best dirty energy policy. Stated differently, a climate-change policy problem can’t arise in models with infinitely-lived agents because such agents
would automatically internalize the externality.
This said, were intergenerational altruism ubiquitous and operational, Golosov
et al. (2014)’s elegant and impressive paper would provide an excellent guide to
the planet’s single dynasty for setting abatement policy. But since this appears
4

The formula also depends critically on the assumption of a fixed saving rate. Life-cycle models, in the
presence of active generational policy, deliver net national saving rates that can vary dramatically through
time. The U.S. net national saving rate was 15 percent in 1950. It’s just 4 percent today. The net national
saving rate is defined her as net national income measured at producer prices less economy-wide consumption,
also measured at producer prices divided by net national income.

2

not to be the case, their model and similar models must be viewed as entailing the
optimization of social welfare functions in which the time-preference rate becomes
a central parameter for optimal carbon policy. Since there is no economic basis
for choosing the preferences of social planners, "optimal" carbon policy devolves
into a matter of ethical conviction.
If one leaves ethics aside and focuses on economics in the context of selfish
life-cycle agents, optimal policy analysis becomes a matter of determining the set
of policies that produce Pareto improvements. Once that set is determined, the
job of the economist is finished and it is up to policymakers to determine what
policies, if any, to undertake.
The natural means of achieving an efficient climate policy is levying a timevarying carbon tax rate, but using, as needed, generation-specific redistribution
to achieve a Pareto improvement. As we show, climate accords that permit delayed limitation of emissions encourage a fast rather than a slow fossil-fuel burn,
which may be economically inefficient; i.e., they can be worse than doing nothing,
producing a Pareto loss.
The same is true of policies that accelerate technical improvement in clean
energy. Telling dirty energy producers that they will face much stiffer competition
from clean energy sources in the relatively near term sends the same "use it or
lose it" message and also lead to a faster burn.
To be clear, our model was designed solely to extend lessons about exhaustible
resource extraction first taught by Hotelling (1931). It is far too simple to provide
precise policy prescriptions. Its use of two periods, rather than annual periods limits its ability to accurately capture annual climate change processes. Furthermore,
using a two-period, rather than an annual-period model constrains the potential
for dynamic policy adjustment through time stressed by Cai et al. (2013) and
others. The choice of long time periods can also, as Cai et al. (2013) stress, affect
both policy prescriptions and overlook stochastic changes to the economy and to
climate damage.
Still, our models’ main message would surely carry over to far more detailed
3

models, including models with more complex preferences, uncertainty, and statedependent policies. The reason is that our model is about the expected time-path
of policy and the point that getting the policy timing wrong can be worse than
running no policy whatsoever.5 To be sure, our point that optimal policy requires
immediate action can be seen in the optimal tax policies computed by Cai et al.
(2013), Golosov et al. (2014), and others. But the literature seems devoid of, or
at least short on, studies examining the cost of policy delay.
Section 2 proceeds with a limited literature review. Section 3 lays out our
model, its equilibrium conditions, and its steady-state properties. Section 4 explains in general terms how we compute the model’s transition-path solution.
Appendix A provides the computation details. Section 5 describes our model’s
calibration. Section 6 presents simulations of the economy’s transition path a) in
the no-policy baseline, b) with a carbon tax, but introduced only after 1 period
(roughly 30 years), and c) with a carbon tax, which is introduced immediately.
In each of the later two simulations, the absolute carbon tax is the same and
remains fixed through time. Our final simulation examines the impact of faster
technological growth in green energy technology, whether stimulated by private
discovery or government investment. Section 7 summarizes and concludes.

Literature Review

There is a large and growing literature on exhaustible resources and climate
change, much of it emanating from seminal contributions by Hotelling (1931),
Solow (1974a,b), Nordhaus (1979), and Sinn (1982). The literature includes theoretical models, optimal tax models, and simulation models, including Nordhaus
(1994, 2008, 2010), Nordhaus and Yang (1996), Nordhaus and Boyer (2000), Sinn
(2007, 2008), Stern (2007), Metcalf (2010, 2014), Gurgel et al. (2011), Rausch
et al. (2011), Manne et al. (1995), Plambeck et al. (1997), Tol (1997, 2002), Tol

We plan, in future work, to add clean and dirty energy sectors as well as climate change to a global version
of the large-scale, multi-regional model presented in Benzell et al. (2015).

et al. (2003), and Ortiz et al. (2011). The latest literature incorporates stochastic
elements, e.g., Golosov et al. (2014) and Cai et al. (2013), endogenous economic
growth, e.g., van der Zwaan et al. (2002), Popp (2004) and Acemoglu et al. (2012),
and problems of coalition formation, e.g., Bréchet et al. (2011), Nordhaus (2015),
Yang (2008).
The Cai et al. (2013) and Golosov et al. (2014) papers are particularly important additions to the literature showing that optimal carbon tax rates can be
considerably higher if the extent of future carbon damage is uncertain. This is
particularly the case if the climate tips. Potential tipping mechanisms include the
near total loss of the Amazon rain forest, faster onset of El Niño, the reversal of
the Gulf Stream and other ocean circulatory systems, the melting of Greenland’s
ice sheet, and the collapse of the West Antarctic ice shelf. Key scientific articles on
climate tipping include Lenton et al. (2008) and Kriegler et al. (2009). The inclusion of uncertainty reminds us that optimal climate policy is a dynamic process,
which responds to the economy’s state of nature.
Our paper is related to a component of the literature that considers resourceextraction and global warming within overlapping generation models. Early papers in this area include Howarth and Norgaard (1990), Howarth and Norgaard
(1992), Burton (1993), Pecchenino and John (1994), John et al. (1995) and Marini
and Scaramozzino (1995). Howarth and Norgaard (1990), Howarth (1991a,b), and
Burton (1993) ignore environmental externalities. The other papers incorporate
environmental degradation.
Howarth and Norgaard (1990), using a pure exchange OLG model, and Howarth
(1991b), using a standard OLG model with capital, demonstrate that policymakers can choose among an infinite number of Pareto efficient paths in the process
of correcting negative environmental externalities. Clearly, social judgments will
matter in deciding which, if any, of such paths to adopt.
6

Howarth (1991a) ex-

Gerlagh and Keyzer (2001), Gerlagh and van der Zwaan (2001) consider the choice among Pareto paths
and the potential use of trust-fund policies that provide future generations a share of the income derived from
the exploitation of the natural resource. Gerlagh and van der Zwaan (2001) also pointed out that demographics
can impact the set of efficient policy paths through their impact on the economy’s general equilibrium.

tended his important work to consider, in general terms, how to analyze economic
efficiency in OLG models in the context of technological shocks. Howarth and Norgaard (1992) introduced damages to the production function from environmental
degradation and studied the problem of sustainable development.7 Rasmussen
(2003) and Wendner (2001) examine the impact of the Kyoto Protocol on the
future course of the energy sector. Wendner (2001) also considers the extent to
which carbon taxes can be used to shore up Austria’s state pension system. Their
papers feature large scale, perfect-foresight, single-country models. But they omit
climate damage per se.
The fact that OLG models do not admit unique solutions when it comes to allocating efficiency gains across agents, including agents born at different dates, has
led some economists to introduce social welfare weights. Papers in this genre include Burton (1993), Calvo and Obstfeld (1988), Endress et al. (2014), Ansuategi
and Escapa (2002), Howarth (1998), Marini and Scaramozzino (1995), Schneider
et al. (2012), Lugovoy and Polbin (2016). In these papers the level of the social
time-preference rate plays a critical role in influencing the choice of abatement
policy.
Our paper is closely related to Bovenberg and Heijdra (1998, 2002), Heijdra
et al. (2006), Karp and Rezai (2014). Their studies consider the use of debt policy to achieve Pareto improvements in the context of adverse climate change.8
But their model differs from ours in three important ways. First, they confine
environmental damage to the utility function. Second, they don’t model clean
as well as dirty energy, with dirty energy exhausting in the future based on the
speed of technological change in the clean energy sector as well as climate change
policy. Third, their focus is not on the Green Paradox, which we view of central
7

An alternative approach to incorporating a negative environmental externality is including environmental
quality directly in the utility function. Pecchenino and John (1994) and John et al. (1995) make this assumption
in a discreet-time OlG models. Marini and Scaramozzino (1995) do the same, but in a continuous-time OLG
framework. The problem of generational equity and sustainable development is also discussed by Batina and
Krautkraemer (1999), Mourmouras (1991, 1993) in a model where energy is renewable.
8
Karp and Rezai (2014) also considers a life-cycle model, but explore the degree to which policy-induced
general equilibrium changes in factor and asset prices could effect a Pareto improvement with no direct redistribution across generations.

importance for analyzing climate change policy.
In addition to explicating the paradoxical effects of phasing in emissions controls or carbon taxes and accelerating technological improvements in the production of green energy, our paper makes clear that social welfare valuations bear no
fundamental connection to the derivation of Pareto efficient emissions policies. Introducing the preferences of a social planner does not impact the range of Pareto
efficient solutions available to correct the negative externalities imposed on future
generations by the burning of fossil fuels by current generations. Instead, it simply
prevents society from understanding the full set of policies that are economically
efficient and potentially turns a win-win policy debate into one in which winners
are pitted against losers.

Modeling Climate Change’s Negative Externality

Following Nordhaus (1994, 2008, 2010), Nordhaus and Yang (1996) and the associated climate-change literature, we assume that productivity in final goods production depends negatively on CO2 concentration. Specifically, we modify Golosov
et al. (2014)’s formulation, which represents a reduced form for the temperaturebased, CO2 -concentration damage mechanism posited in Nordhaus (1994)’s seminal paper.
Golosov et al. (2014) assume that CO2 concentration has permanent and
temporary components, with the permanent component depending solely on cumulative CO2 emissions. In our model, this is simply the sum of initial, time-0
CO2 concentration plus the additional concentration arising from exhausting, over
time, R0 - the time-0 stock of oil reserves.10 We modify the Golosov et al. (2014)
formulation by making climate damage the sum of two components. The first is
a function of the maximum past CO2 concentration level. The second captures
tipping point damage, which is triggered if CO2 concentration exceeds a critical
10

Golosov et al. (2014)’s model has no steady state. Instead, it potentially features permanently increasing
climate change damage arising from the ongoing use of coal, which is assumed to be in infinite supply.

threshold.
To be precise, we define the damage to output’s productivity at time t, Dt , as
¯ + gG,
Dt = 1 − exp(−γ max ([Js − J]))
s≤t

(15)

where g = 0 for Js < J ∗ and g = 1 for Js ≥ J ∗ . The term Jt references CO2
concentration at time t, J¯ is the pre-industrial CO2 concentration level, and J ∗
is the critical tipping point value of CO2 concentration.11 In (15) the highest past
level of CO2 emissions determines the first component of damages. The second
component, which entails a potential damage level of G, is triggered for all future
periods if the current concentration level exceeds J ∗ . Climate change damages
output productivity according to
At = (1 − Dt )Zt .

(16)

CO2 Concentration at time t, Jt , is the sum of the permanent and temporary
components, J1,t and J2,t . I.e.,
Jt = J1,t + J2,t .

(17)

The permanent carbon concentration component, J1,t , evolves according to
J1,t = J1,t−1 + dL Ot .

(18)

The temporary concentration component, J2,t , depreciates at rate d with additions to the temporary stock of carbon depending on the share, 1 − dL absorbed
by the oceans and other carbon sinks, and d0 , the extent to which non-absorbed
carbon reaches the atmosphere.
J2,t = (1 − d)J2,t−1 + d0 (1 − dL )Ot .
11

This is Golosov et al. (2014)’s damage function apart from the maximum operator.

(19)

3.3

Technical Change

We assume technology improves according to
Zt = Z0 exp(gZ t)

(20)

Bt = B0 exp(gB t).

(21)

and
As shown below, gZ can differ from gB without preventing long-run balanced
growth. Indeed, our model admits many different long-run balanced growth paths.
These include steady states in which output grows faster or slower than energy
supply. If energy supply grows at a slower rate than output, its price must fall
through time.

3.4

Households

Households born at time t maximize utility defined over the logarithm of consumption when young, cyt , and consumption when old, cot+1 .
U = (1 − m) log cyt + m log cot+1 .

(22)

Households work only when young. Oil revenues, τt Ot in period t, are transferred to the contemporaneous elderly. Since the elderly collectively own time-t
oil reserves, this use of oil revenues limits the economic impact of carbon taxation
to its direct effect on dirty energy production.12

I.e., it rules out intergenerational redistribution or changes in government consumption, which would have

When t > T the distribution of capital and labor in the output and energy sectors
satisfies

and

When t ≤ T , factor allocation across sectors is more complex. But the system
of factor supply and demand equations can be reduced to the following four equations in sector-specific capital and labor demands. These demands can be solved
non-linearly for a given price of energy.

Long-Run Balanced Growth

In the long run, after all oil reserves have been extracted and climate change damage has stabilized, output and clean energy grow at rates gY and gS determined
by
gY =

gZ + (1 − α − β)gB
1 − α − θ(1 − α − β)

and
gS = gB + θ

gZ + (1 − α − β)gB
.
1 − α − θ(1 − α − β)

(34)

(35)

In addition, the prices of energy and land grow at rates gP and gN determined
by

gZ (1 − θ) − gB β
1 − α − θ(1 − α − β)

(36)

gZ + (1 − α − β)gB
≡ gY .
1 − α − θ(1 − α − β)

(37)

gP =
and
gN =

It’s easy to show that, along the economy’s balanced growth path, the wage
rate grows at gY and that the return to capital is constant.
These equations admit a range of long-run dynamics. To illustrate, figure 1
presents long-run growth rates in the supply and price of solar energy for a) alternative values of the parameters gB , the rate of technical change in solar energy,
Θ, the share of capital in producing solar energy, and b) empirically reasonable
values of the parameters α, β, and gY , respectively.13
Since our model excludes population growth, we set gY to .01, which comports
13

Note that given these parameter values, gZ is determined by (34)

13

with annual per capita GDP growth of 1 percent. This is in line with recent
experience in developed countries. We also set capital’s share in the production of
output at 30 percent and labor’s share at 65 percent. Hence, α = .30 and β = .65.
This makes energy’s output share 5 percent.14

the price of solar for different combinations of θ and gB . The light blue plane,
which is flat with a height of zero for all combinations of the two parameters,
clarifies that growth in solar output is never negative and is highest when the
price of solar is falling most rapidly. Since output is assumed to be growing at a
1 percent annual rate, our model can produce much more rapid growth in solar
energy than in output. It can also produce slower growth.
In the case that θ, like α, equals .30 and gB equals .01 (i.e., 1 percent technical
change in solar per year), gZ , the underlying annual rate of technical change in
producing output, Y , is .006. I.e., output grows annually about two thirds faster
than its rate of technical change. For these parameters, solar energy grows at 1.3
percent per year and its price falls at .3 percent per year. However, the higher
growth rate in output than in energy isn’t primarily due to the faster growth in
solar energy, but to the growth rate in the stock of capital, which is also 1 percent
each year.
If θ is .30, but technical growth in solar, gB is quite rapid, say 2 percent per
year, solar energy will grow at 2.3 percent annual. Its price will fall by 1.3 percent.
Since these are permanent growth rates, our economy’s long-run price of energy
will asymptotically approach zero.
Note that we’ve been discussing long-run growth rates. But it’s important to
bear in mind that the absolute levels of output, wages, and consumption will,
at any point in time, including any time along the economy’s balance growth
path, be smaller based on the degree to which the transition to balance growth
has involved higher concentration of CO2 . Stated differently, given that climate
change’s damage depends on the highest past level of CO2 emissions, all future
generations will be negatively impacted by earlier generations that let carbon
levels reach new heights, however temporarily.

Solving the Transition

To solve the model’s transition, we first normalize the time-t levels of all variables,
Xt , by their specific cumulative long-run growth factors, egX t . I.e., we define
X̂t =

Xt
egX t

(38)

and rewrite all equations of our model in terms of these transformed variables.
For example, the transformed equation for final output production is
α β
Ŷt = (1 − Dt )Ẑt K̂y,t
Ly,t Ŝt1−α−β .

(39)

For a second example the transformed equation for equilibrium in the final
goods market is
Ŷt = egY K̂t+1 − (1 − δ)K̂t + ĉyt + ĉot .

(40)

The transformed system of equations has a well defined stationary state (i.e.,
all transformed variables are constant). This means, of course, that the model’s
original variables grow in the long run at the rate used in their normalization.
Note, in this regard, than in (39) the value of Dt will vary through time along the
transition path, but be constant along the economy’s balanced growth path.
We provide an informal description of our solution method here and provide
details in Appendix. In solving the normalized model’s transition we use the initial
conditions for capital, oil reserves, and temporary and permanent levels of CO2
emissions, K0 , R−1 , J1,−1 and J2,−1 , respectively.
We assume (but subsequently verify) that the economy reaches its balanced
growth path by date M . Next we guess a path of damages, Dt from t = 1 through
M . We solve the entire transition conditional on this guessed path of damages
and then update the guessed path of damages and resolve the model. In the final
solution to the model, the guessed path of damages is consistent with the model’s
actual path of damages.
16

For any assumed path of damages, we start with a guess of T = 0. In step 2,
we guess the path for K̂t for t = 1 through T + 1. In step 3, we use our guessed
value of K̂T +1 to solve for the economy’s transition from T onward using the
method in Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987).
The solution for the post-T economy’s transition yields, among other things,
a value for pT +1 . In step 4, we use this value to guess the path of pt for 0 ≤ t ≤ T .
Specifically, we backcast the values for pt by assuming that their path obeys (13)
with equality. To do this, we first assume the path of returns from t = 0 to t = T
is constant and equals the long-run value of r found in step 3.
In step 5 we iterate over our guessed path of K̂t through t = T + 1 and all
other of the models’ variables for periods up through T . I.e. we solve for factor
allocations, wage rates, and returns. In each iteration, we use the updated rate of
return series to update our backcast of pt .
In step 6 we check if oil reserves exhaust at our guessed value of T , i.e., if
cumulative oil consumption through T exceeds R0 . If they do not, we raise T
to T + 1 and return to step 3. Once we find a time T ∗ such that cumulative oil
consumption oil exceeds initial reserves, we set T = T ∗ and repeat step 5 but base
+1 −τT +1
. In this
our backcasting off of a guessed value of pT that is larger than τT + pT1+r
T +1

innerloop we adjust the value of pT upward until we find the lowest value which
is consistent with cumulative oil consumption through time T equaling initial
reserves. This condition is simply that the oil market clears on an intertemporal
basis. Note that any higher price would entail less demand for oil through T and
would not, therefore, be consistent with exhaustion at T .
Once we have found paths of the economy through period T and beyond that
are consistent with market-clearing in the intertemporal oil market, we use the
path of oil production to update our guess of Dt and repeat the entire analysis
starting at step 1 until the guessed path of Dt equals the assumed path of Dt .

Calibration

We chose the following parameters for our baseline calculations. The share of
wages saved by the young, m, is set to .5. The capital, labor, and energy shares in
(1), the coefficients α, β, and (1 − α − β) in the production function for output,
are set to .3, .65, and .05, respectively. The capital, labor, and land shares in
(6) (the coefficients θ, φ, and (1 − θ − φ) in the production function for clean
energy) are set to .2, .2, and .6, respectively. The depreciation rate, δ, is set to
1.0. The technology coefficients, A and B, are set to 12 and 15, respectively. If the
climate isn’t tipped, the long-run damage to output productivity, absent policy,
is 30 percent. The trigger point concentration level, J ∗ equals 45. We set G such
that steady-state damages, if the tipping point is triggered, equal 50 percent of
output productivity.
The initial stocks of reserves, R0 , and capital, K0 , are set to 50 and 3, respectively. The quantity of land, H, is normalized to 1. The climate change damage
parameters, γ, dL , d0 , and d, are set to .009, .2, 1, and .2. Our total factor productivity growth rates, gz and gB , are set to .67 percent and .82 percent.15
These parameters were chosen to generate the following realistic macroeconomic relationships. Dirty energy initially constitutes 95 percent of total energy
supply. This no-policy baseline economy’s real return to capital, measured on an
annual basis, is 1.5 percent, initially, and 2 percent in the long run. The long-run
growth rate of output is 1.03 percent, the long-run growth rate of clean energy is
also 1.03 percent, and the long-run growth rate of the price of energy is zero.
15

These are annual growth rates.

Simulation Findings

6.1

The Baseline, No Carbon Tax Transition Path

Our baseline simulation, which features no policy, is depicted in figure 2. All
variables are detrended by their long-run growth rate. The initial value of capital
is taken from the economy’s steady state in the absence of any climate damage.
As can be seen, the depletion of oil occurs at the end of the fourth period,
roughly 120 years in real time, although most of the depletion occurs in the first
two periods, roughly 60 years. Carbon concentration, Jt , rises through time, but
never passes the tipping point. At time 0, the level of carbon damage, Dt , is close
to .2, i.e., 20 percent. In the long run, Dt , equals .3. This increase in damages and
the induced decline in capital as well as the long-run reduction in energy produces
a roughly one third decline in output compared to its level at time 0.
As oil is depleted, the price of energy rises as does the supply of clean energy. The damage inflicted on the economy lowers real wages, which limits the
ability of young workers to save. Consequently, the capital stock falls relative to
its initial value. So too does consumption of the young and old. The charts also
show a reallocation of capital between the output and clean-energy sectors. As
expected, the rental rate and price of land both rise reflecting the higher demand
for clean energy. The relative scarcity of capital leads to a higher real interest rate.
The value of oil reserves naturally declines to zero as the reserves are depleted.
Interestingly, the economy becomes less energy-intensive in the long run.

6.2

The Delayed Carbon Tax Transition Path

Figure 3 considers the introduction of a permanent absolute tax equal to .08
starting in period 1. The blue curves reference the baseline transition. The red
curves reference the transition under the period-1 (i.e., delayed) carbon tax. Dirty
energy producers respond to this "use it or lose it" policy by exhausting all oil
reserves in the initial, time-0, period. This faster fossil-fuel burn produces both
earlier and larger damages. Indeed, carbon concentration becomes sufficiently high
to tip the climate. As a result, initial as well as all future generations end up
consuming less, both when young and when old. Consequently, the delayed carbontax policy produces a Pareto loss. The loss is substantial. All generations suffer
declines in remaining lifetime consumption of roughly 40 percent.

6.3

The Immediate Carbon Tax Transition Path

Figure 4 shows the impact of implementing the same carbon tax, but starting
in period 0. The blue curves again reference the no-policy transition and the red
curves reference the transition with an immediate carbon tax. This alternative
policy gives dirty energy producers a strong incentive to delay production. Indeed, rather than exhaust after 1 period (30 years), exhaustion occurs by in 6
(approximately 180 years). This much slower fossil fuel burn reduces damages in
both the short and long runs. It also producers higher levels of consumption of all
generations in all periods of life alive at time 0 and thereafter. I.e., it produces a
Pareto gain.

6.4

The Impact of Technological Change on the Transition

This simulation uses the same initial conditions as in the baseline scenario. It
differs solely in positing a faster rate of technological change in clean energy
production.16 Specially, we double the growth rate of Bt , gB , from 0.82 to 1.64
percent on an annual basis.
16

We assume that this shock to technology was not known prior to period 0

Figure 5 shows the variables without detrending to make clear what happens
to absolute values.17 There is, as one would expect, a lower price path of energy,
even in period 0. This produces more and, thus, faster use of dirty energy, but,
actually, less short-run use of clean energy. Consequently, there is little impact on
the economy in time 0.
Our next simulation considers a major, but one-time jump in the level of clean
energy technology, Bt , occurring in the second period (t = 1). We assume that in
subsequent periods Bt grows at the baseline growth rate. We calibrate the size of
the jump to produce the same long-run after-tax price of energy as in the delayed
carbon-tax scenario (figure 3).
As Figure 6 shows, if the market perceives that clean energy technology will
improve significantly in the not-to-distant future, the price of energy will fall
dramatically and most of the economy’s existing oil reserves will immediately be
extracted. Like delaying the imposition of a significant carbon tax, this path of
emissions tips the climate, dramatically and permanently exacerbating carbon
damage. This, in turn, significantly reduces both output and capital formation,
producing a substantial Pareto loss for all generations. The price of land first
rises and then falls during the transition relative to the baseline. This reflects the
near-term higher level of technology and, thus, marginal productivity of land, and
the lower short-run interest rates. Over time, though, the environmental damage
reduces the marginal productivity of all inputs, including energy and this, in turn,
lowers the discounted present value of future land rents.
A comparison of 5 and 6 indicates that exactly how clean energy is expected
to evolve can make a major difference to whether we have a fast or slow burn
and whether the planet’s climate tips or not. In figure 6, the near-term technical
advance leads dirty-energy energy producers to exploit their reserves at a much
faster rate producing considerable external damage. Hence, good news about clean
energy technology improvements can spell bad news for the planet and for both
current and future generations.

Figure 7 depicts the variables without trend elimination.18 It shows the impact of a faster rate of technical progress in the final goods production sector.
Specifically, we double the growth rate of Zt from 0.67 to 1.34 percent on annual
basis. All variables that grow, in the long run, at rate gY are shown without the
gY offset to make clear how the level of the variable has changed in the baseline,
where gY has a smaller value.
This raises the demand for energy and its price, relative to the baseline scenario, continues growing in the long-run. On the other hand, the more rapid
technical change increases the growth rate and level of interest rates. This leaves
oil producers with no reason to exhaust their reserves at a quicker pace than in
the baseline.
Figure 8 also shows results without controlling for trend.19 It simulates a
permanent doubling of both growth rates, gB and gZ . Thus gY also doubles and
increases from 1.03 to 2.06 percents on annual basis. This experiment leads to a
short run decline in energy prices, but a much higher path of interest rates. The
equilibrium response is faster exhaustion of oil and higher initial and permanent
damages.
There are a number of offsetting factors underlying figure 8. Clean energy
technology is growing at a faster pace. This puts downward pressure on energy
prices, but the higher growth rate of final goods technology exerts upward energyprice pressure.

Conclusion

This paper uses a bare bones model to make a simple, but important point. The
world’s supply of dirty energy is, to a large extent, fixed in supply. This means
that short of prohibiting its production and sale, most of the world’s dirty energy
will be used. The only question is when. If it is used quickly, we’ll have a fast
burn and the damage to the planet will, according to some estimates, be massive
and irreversible. If it is used slowly, we’ll have a slow burn and the damage will
be mitigated.
Delaying the implementation of carbon abatement policy, which we model as
the delayed imposition of a carbon tax, gives dirty energy producers strong incentives to "use it or lose it." As our model shows, this can significantly accelerate
the production and sale of carbon leaving current and future generations worse
off than in the absence of any abatement policy. In contrast, immediately implementing the same size carbon tax can materially limit climate damage and raise
welfare for all generations. Our paper also shows that announcing a near-term,
but one-time improvement in clean energy technology can also lead dirty energy
producers to use it before they lose it. Hence, we have the prospect of news of
near-term clean-energy technological improvements triggering reactions by dirty
energy producers that accelerate climate change.
Hence, paradoxically, the Paris Accord could be accelerating climate change.
So could certain incentives to improve green-energy technology that will pay off
only through time.

Step A. Find the Economy’s Steady State
?
Guess K̂i? , compute the supply of capital K S , update K̂i+1
= 0.8K̂i? + 0.2K S ,
?
− K̂i? < .
and iterate until K̂i+1
Step B. Find T
The price of energy at T satisfies
p T − τT ≥
or
p T − τT = χ

pT +1 − τT +1
1 + rT +1

pT +1 − τT +1

1 + rT +1

χ ∈ [1, ∞)

(42)

Let us set χ at 1 and find a date T at which cumulative oil consumption
exceeds oil reserves, but at date T − 1 cumulative oil consumption is less than oil
reserves. Then in step C we iterate on χ to equalize cumulative oil consumption
and oil reserves at time T . We also define some large value, M , by which time the
model converges to its steady state.
Step B1. Set T = 0.
Step B2. Set χ = 1.
Step B3. Guess Kti , t ∈ [1, T + 1].
Step B4. Given the value of KTi +1 in the the non-oil regime, find a transition
path from T + 1 to the steady state by iterating over the path of capital. Guess
Ktj , t ∈ [T + 2, M − 1], update Ktj+1 = 0.8Ktj + 0.2KtS , t ∈ [T + 2, M − 1], iterate
until Ktj+1 − Ktj
< ε, t ∈ [T + 2, M − 1]. The converged solution provides
∞
paths for all variables at t ∈ [T + 2, M − 1].
p

p0 −τ
Step B5. Guess p0T = τT + χ T +11+r?T +1 , p0t = τt+1 + t+11+r?t+1 , t < T .
Step B6. For t ≤ T and given the path for price of energy, determine the
allocation of total capital and labor between clean energy and final goods production sectors using the bisection method to solve the nonlinear system of equations (30)-(33). Compute rt and update the guess of the price path for energy:

Step B8. Compute capital supply KtS , t ∈ [1, T + 1]. Update the path of
capital Kti+1 = 0.8Kti + 0.2KtS , t ∈ [1, T + 1].
Step B9. Repeat steps B4-B8 until Kti+1 − Kti ∞ < ε, t ∈ [1, T + 1].

Step C. Find transition path. We have found date T at which cumulative
oil consumption exceeds oil reserves. But at date T −1 cumulative oil consumption
is less than oil reserves. Now we will solve for the transition path that entails
equalization of cumulative oil consumption and oil reserves at T . At steps B3-B10
T
P
we have a mapping G : χ →
Ot . Define a function g (χ) = G (χ) − R0 . Solve
t=1

the equation g (χ) = 0, [1, χ̄] using the bisection method, where χ̄ is some upper
bound for χ. For each χi we need to iterate on steps B3-B10.
