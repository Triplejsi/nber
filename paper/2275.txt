On the Definition and Magnitude of Recent Capital Flight

ABSTRACT
This paper presents a survey of alternative definitions of
capital flight and empirical estimates of capital flight
utilizing a common database. At the conceptual level, we argue

that the definition of capital flight requires a somewhat
arbitrary distinction between normal capital flows and those
representing capital flight. At the empirical level, our results
illustrate the range of estimates of capital flight that are
possible and how alternative definitions or databases contribute
to the dispersion of estimates. Our results show that for some
countries, differences in definitions or databases may have
substantial effects, causing some estimates of capital flight to
be positive and others negative.
We argue that an appropriate definition of capital flight is
one that is consistent with the kinds of economic questions under
consideration. In theory, capital flight should be viewed within
the context of a general equilibrium model. When this is done,
capital flight will appear to be a symptom of underlying economic
forces rather than a cause of national welfare losses.

ON THE DEFINITION AND MAGNITUDE OF RECENT CAPITAL FLIGHT

I. Introduction and Overview
The economic performance of the world's lesser developed countries
(LDC5) is now a key factor affecting the future of the international

financial system. And key to LDC performance is their ability to
channel capital funds (from foreign loans, foreign equity, and
domestic sources) into domestic investments, while meeting their
commitments on existing external debt. It is curious that until
recently, the disposition of domestic funds (in particular, the
possibility for large scale domestic capital outflows, or "capital
flight") was not considered seriously within the context of LDC
performance. Perhaps this oversight was aided by the ready
availability of foreign funds or the inadequacy of data on domestic
capital outflows. But even taking the philosophical stance that
private citizens ought to retain the right to invest their funds
globally, it still remains that a country's macroeconomic performance
could be severely effected by a sudden or prolonged outflow of
domestic capital.

Several studies that we review suggest that LDC private capital
outflows over the last ten years were at least $50 billion and perhaps
$200 billion or even higher. Estimates of this magnitude clearly
support the view that if LDC capital outflows could be reduced or
reversed, the adjustment burden facing LDCs would be eased
substantially. Furthermore, the magnitude of LDC capital outflows has
been observed by commercial bankers, and cited in order to justify a
reduction in further lending to some LDC countries. Thus LDC capital
outflows may be a double cost if foreign sources of funds are cut off.
1

The purpose of this paper is to survey and analyze the various
definitions and measures of capital flight that have been offered in
the recent literature. Our approach is two-fold. First, at the
conceptual level, we discuss the basis for classifying particular
domestic capita]. outflows as "capital flight" rather than as "normal"
flows. It has been pointed out in earlier papers that the selection of
a particular definition for capital flight ought to be made with
consideration for the type of research question under examination. We
explore this issue further, asking whether any of the definitions
proposed so far are adequate to provide information for the decisions
facing bankers and government officials.

The second part of our approach is empirical. We first discuss how
to operationa].jze the various

definitions of capital flight. Our
objective here is to re—compute alternative estimates of capital

flight using a common database. Some researchers have adopted an
accounting framework for measuring capital flight that includes only a
designated subset of domestic capital outflows. We replicate these
measurements on a common database for standard

time periods to show

the dispersion in estimates of capital flight brought about by
alternative definitions. Recent papers by Dooley (1986) and Khan and
Ul Haque (1986) use a more indirect
approach, measuring capital flight
as the difference between all external claims and those external

claims that generate receipts captured in the balance of payments
accounts. These latter calculations could

not be replicated, but they

are reported for the sake of comparison.

The empirical analysis also reviews the sources of estimation

error that may affect our estimates of capital flight. Evidence on

2

the extent of overinvoicing of imports and underinvoicing of exports
using partner—country trade data comparisons is discussed.
The plan for the paper is as follows. Section II contains our
discussion of the conceptual issues related to the measurement of
capital flight, and a review of the definitions of capital flight that
have been adopted in the literature. Our empirical results and a
comparison of alternative capital flight estimates are presented in
Section III. The final section offers the policy implications of our
findings and other concluding remarks.

The major conclusions we reach can be summarized simply. The
empirical evidence suggests that the range of estimates (high - low)
of capital flight resulting from the various definitions for our
sample countries is usually about $10 billion but sometimes greater
than $20 billion. That there is considerable dispersion in the
estimates should be neither surprising nor discouraging since theory
does not offer a unique definition of capital flight. An appropriate
definition will be one that is consistent with the kinds of economic
questions under consideration. In theory, capital flight should be
viewed within the context of a complete (i.e. general equilibrium)
economic model. Without such a model, we can only guess whether
additional lending to LDCs will foster more capital flight, or whether
the same lending might signal an improvement in the prospects for
better economic performance and a reversal of capital flight.

II. Alternative Measures of Capital Flight

A. Conceptual Issues Regarding Capital Outflows.

Economic principles do not guide us to a unique or natural
definition for the term "capital flight." Domestic residents in an
open economy engage in international transactions. Some of these

transactions lead domestic residents to acquire financial claims
against non—residents. Which of these transactions ought to be
classified as domestic capital flight rather than normal capital

outflows? The list might include all foreign assets (both reported and
unreported, including financial assets, direct foreign investments,
and real estate) acquired by the banking and non-bank private sectors
as well as the public sector, or it could be only a subset of this
complete list..-' Alternatively, on might attempt to distinguish among
flows by the circumstances or nature of the investment.

This classification problem is similar to the dilemma of computing
the balance of payments under
a pegged exchange rate regime. How did
economists distinguish between "autonomous" and "accommodating"
international transactions? In practice, some arbitrary decisions were
made to classify the motives behind anonymous accounting entries.V

Assuming that the classification was done correctly, the policy
relevance of such a balance of payments estimate would be primarily as
a signal. Policy making is carried out ex ante to effect future

outcomes, while the balance of payments figure reflects ex post
events. To enhance its relevance for policy, the balance of payments

definition would need to be imbedded within

a complete (i.e. general

equilibrium) model to determine how current and prospective economic

policies might influence the future balance of payments and national
welfare.

4

The analogy to the problem of estimating the magnitude of capital
flight and determining the impact of capital flight on welfare is

clear. Classifying capital transactions to arrive at an estimate of
capital flight will require a certain number of arbitrary
distinctions. Absent a complete model, it should not be clear how
future policies will effect capital flight or how capital flight
effects welfare. And even if capital flight reduces domestic welfare,

the optimal amount of capital flight will not be zero as long as there
are costs to preventing it.
1. Alternative Classification Measures

To approach the distinction between "capital flight" and "normal"
capital outflows, one obvious dichotomy is the division between legal
and illegal transactions. It seems fair to say that all illegal
transactions are not "normal." However, illegal transactions need not
be motivated by a desire to avoid domestic financial markets, per se.
The primary motivation for certain current account transactions may be
the evasion of tariffs, quotas, or laws regarding trade in illegal
drugs or other activities, and these transactions necessarily generate
a capital account dimension. However, illegal transactions are not
reported, so it is difficult to determine how much they contribute to
"capital flight." Evidence presented in Gulati (1987) and in Section
III on partner—country trade data provides some indication of which
countries are engaged in overinvoicing imports and underinvoicing
exports, perhaps to effect capital flight.
Within the category of legal international capital transactions,
our bias would be to classify all freely organized transactions as

"normal." Assuming that domestic investors are risk—averse utility

5

maximizers, portfolio theory strongly suggests that investors will
hold a well—diversified portfolio of financial assets that maximizes
real returns for a given level of risk. For investors from small

countries with poorly developed capital markets, there will be a
natural demand for assets in other countries with more developed
capital markets. Where inflation has eroded real returns or real

wealth, it is normal to expect investors to seek other markets or
units—of—account that preserve purchasing power. When substantial
exchange rate changes are expected (in larger industrial countries or
poorer developing Countries), we expect to find investors positioning
themselves in advance to make the best of the situation. Whenever
markets are highly integrated and transaction costs are low, private
individuals will have strong incentives to circumvent what
appear to
be arbitrary barriers to their own utility maximization/

Our bias for classifying all

freely organized legal transactions
as "normal" may seem in opposition to the notion that "flight
capital
is capital which flees" advanced by Ingo Walter and Charles
Kindleberger elsewhere in this volume. In a market paradigm, the
decisions of investors
concerning whether to invest funds at home or
abroad depend on relative returns suitably adjusted for rates of

inflation, expected exchange rate changes, taxes and risk factors.
If,
for example, this return differential favors the United States
over
Mexico, on what basis can we conclude
that capita]. is fleeing from

Mexico rather than being drawn into the United States? In
general,
economic models presume that private domestic investors are scanning
the environment in search of higher expected returns and that
capital
movements are motivated by self-interest. In order to justify a
negative connotation ("capital flight") for a subset of capital
6

movements, there must be a derogation from the market paradigm, such
as a deviation between private and social welfare.

2. Capital Flight and Nationalism
The notion that capital flight represents a source of disutility
focuses on a nationalistic measure of social utility. In a variety of
cases, it can be argued that domestic capital outflows might reduce
domestic social welfare, even though they increase the private welfare
of both domestic and foreign residents who participate in the capital
transfer. Cuddington (1986) outlines several such cases, for example:
(i) Hot money flows may destabilize financial markets,

(ii) Social returns on domestic projects may exceed private
domestic returns,
(iii) By raising a country's gross borrowing needs, capital
flight raises the marginal cost of foreign debt (Special
case of [ii]),

(iv) Once capital leaves it never returns resulting in lower
domestic investment and a lower domestic tax base.
As Cuddington suggests, each of these cases can be refuted by
demonstrating that policies to restrict capital flight would either be
ineffective or second—best policies. Regarding (i), it could certainly
be a possibility that underlying macroeconomic policies and market
fundamentals, rather than capital flight, were responsible for
financial market volatility. Regarding (ii), the first-best policy
would be to attack a distortion of this sort directly by providing
additional incentives to the private rate of return on capital. And
regarding (iv), reversals of capital flight have indeed occured. But
even if they had not, it is an exageration to claim that flight
capital is "lost to the country," and there is no certainty that the

7

alternative placement of flight capital would be in domestic
investment.
As noted earlier, any definition of capital flight
may seem to
reflect arbitrary distinctions. One way to reduce these is to
link a
definition of capital flight to its impact on national utility.

Under the assumption that funds committed to capital flight
would
have been used for domestic
investment, then the total build—up of
foreign assets scales the magnitude
of national disutility from
capital flight. This assumption suggests that an expansive definition
of capital flight that captures the reported and
unreported increase
in foreign assets for both the private and public sectors
would be
appropriate. Defining capital flight as the total build-up of
foreign
assets implies that (1) foreign assets, even the working
capita].
balances of source country
multinational firms, never yield higher
national utility than domestic assets, and (ii) a build-up of domestic
assets, rather than consumption of
foreign goods or wasteful domestic
spending, was the alternative to
capital flight. Both Erbe (1985) and
the World Bank (1985) use an expansive measure of
capital flight.
Dooley (1986) proposes that the stock of claims held on nonresidents that do not gnerate investment income on the
balance of
payments be taken as a measure of
capital flight. The presumption here
is that the interest earned
on legal and normal capital outflows would
be reported in the balance of payments. Interest earned
on illegal
capital outflows, or outflows motivated by tax avoidance or the demand
for secrecy are assumed to

go unreported. Capital flight can be

approximated by capitalizing the stream of ported investment income

and subtracting this from total external claims.
In one sense, this technique could be viewed as a novel
approach
8

for measuring the stock of unreported external claims, i.e. capital
flight. But the definition implies that if all capital outflows and

the investment income on them were reported, then there would be zero
capital flight. This suggests that the loss of national utility from
capital flight comes not from the diversion of domestic capital to
offshore investments, but rather from the loss of foreign exchange
receipts upon repatriation of offshore earnings and the loss of taxing
power over these offshore earnings. Even this is somewhat of an
overstatement since domestic residents could reinvest (and report)

their offshore earnings without producing any foreign exchange
earnings for the domestic economy. With Dooley's definition, the
disutility of capital flight seems to correspond with the inability of
a country to generate foreign investment receipts sufficient to
service its own external debt. However, if individuals have
transferred funds offshore at lower yields (reflecting their demand
for secrecy, stability or safe haven), then the country could still

have a debt servicing problem even if all investment income is
reported.

B. Measuring Capital Flight
The definitions of capital flight found in the previous literature

can be usefully grouped into two types. The first type does not
distinguish between "normal" capital flows and capital flight and
seeks to measure the acquisition of net foreign assets, or some subset

of these claims, by the private sector. The second type attempts to
make the distinction between "nomal" capital and flight capital by
measuring the stock of foreign claims that does not generate income
that is reported in the balance of payments accounts.

9

The broadest definition of capital flight has been employed by the
World Bank (1985) and by Erbe (1985). This measure takes inflows of
capital in the form of increases in external debt and net foreign

direct investment and subtracts from these inflows the current account
deficit and the increase in official reserves. The difference between

these inflows and the extent to which they are used to finance the
current account deficit and an increase in reserves is taken to
reflect an increase in net foreign claims by the private sector. This
increase in net foreign assets is the measure of capital flight they
adopt.

The capital flight definition adopted by Morgan Guaranty (1986)
also measures capital flight as a residual. In addition to the
current account deficit and the increase in

official reserves, Morgan
Guaranty (1986) also subtracts the increase in short term foreign

assets of the banking system from total capital inflows. The Morgan
definition then does not consider acquisition of foreign assets by
banks to be capital flight, while

acquisition of foreign assets by

other agents is considered to be capital flight.
Cline (1986) critiques the capita]. flight definition adopted by
Morgan and discusses adjustments to the Morgan calculations. He
argues that income from tourism and border transactions should be
excluded from current account earnings since these earnings are beyond
the control of foreign exchange control authorities, and thus should

not be counted when calculating

capital flight. In addition, he

argues that reinvested investment income should not be considered
capita]. flight since this income is also beyond the control of the

authorities and that if residents do not repatriate income from

capital held abroad, this should not be considered additional flight
10

of capital.

What is the justification for these exclusions from the broad

measure of capital flight? Morgan Guaranty (1986) offers no
justification for treating the banking system differently from other

firms and individuals. None will be given here. The question that
dine wishes to address regards the extent to which future inflows of
funds will result in additional capital flight. He wishes to
determine the "

'marginal

propensity' of capital to leave" the country

and argues that "the presence of a tourism surplus not garnered by the
government, and of non—repatriated private interest earnings abroad,
have little to do with the issue of how new capital is used when
obtained."

One aspect of determining how likely will be future capital flight
is the extent to which capital controls are effective in preventing

acquisition of foreign assets by the private sector. The adjustments
suggested by dine may be relevant to determine the extent to which
the private sector has been able to circumvent exchange controls in
the past..4! If after making these adjustments, the degree of capital
flight is greatly reduced, the evidence would suggest that capital
controls have been somewhat successful in restricting movements of

funds abroad. On the other hand, if we are interested in the extent
to which a country is likely to experience capital flight in the
future, then we should examine how macroeconomic conditions and
government policies underlying capital outflows have changed rather
than attempting to identify particular items that should or should not
be counted as income that is subject to capital flight.
Cuddington (1986) takes a different approach to measuring capital

11

flight. His focus is on short-term capital flows, which he believes
to be the typical meaning of capital flight, rather than all private
sector acquisition of external claims.

Capital flight, defined to

consist of acquisition of short—term external assets by the non—bank
private sector, is calculated by adding the errors and omissions to

selected short-term capital items that are chosen individually for
each country he considers.
Why should the focus be on short—term capital movements rather
than both short-term and long-term capital? Cuddington (1986) chooses
to consider only short—term capital since he is examining "hot money",
funds that respond quickly to changes in expected returns or to
changes in risk. Presumably these are also the funds that potentially
will be the quickest to return to the country when conditions change.
There are a couple of problems with measuring capital flight in this
way, however. First, as Cuddington (1986) notes, the errors and
omissions do not consist only of unreported short—term capital.
Second, the case for considering only short—term funds is less than
compelling. An investor, reacting to unfavorable conditions at home
(such as an anticipated devaluation), may acquire stocks, long—term

bonds, or deposits with more than a year to maturity or "real" assets

as well as a short—term financial assets. The motivation for all such
acquisitions will be identical as will their effect on the investor's
home country. In addition, it is difficult to make the case that

short-term funds are more likely to react quickly either in leaving
the investor's home country or in returning. In today's international
financial markets there is very little loss of liquidity associated

with acquiring long-term bonds (especially U.S. government bonds,
corporate

bonds traded on U.S. markets, or Eurobonds) or equities../
12

Thus, whether one wishes to measure private—sector acquistion of
foreign assets or the component of these asset that can flow and
reflow quickly, is seems best to look beyond short—term capital flows.

An alternative (not pursued in any previous attempts to measure
capital flight) is to combine private sector external borrowing with
government and government—guaranteed external borrowing and measure
the acquisition of gross rather than net private sector external

assets. The reason for doing so is that should a balance—of—payments
crisis arise, the government may, as has happened in a number of

cases, take on the obligation of servicing this private debt. If so
the private external borrowing may be considered a contingent

liability of the government./ One might also include foreign
exchange value guaranties provided to holders of foreign currency
denominated accounts and any forward market intervention that the
authorities have undertaken.

Dooley (1986) and Khan and Ui Haque (1986) define capital flight
as those external assets held by the private sector that do not
generate income recorded in the balance of payments accounts of the
country.

Dooley (1986) measures the stock of external claims by summing
identified capital flows in the balance of payments accounts and

making two adjustments to capture unreported capital flows. The first
of these is to add the errors and omissions. The second adjustment
Dooley carries out is based on a comparison of the World Bank data on
the stock of external debt and external borrowing reported in the

balance—of—payments accounts. If both sources report borrowing
accurately, one ought to be able to match closely the change in the

13

stock of debt reported by the World Bank with the net flows of new
borrowing reported in the balance of payments accounts. This is
frequently not the case, however. In several countries the annual

change in the stock of external debt as reported by the World Bank is

considerably larger than flows reported in the balance of payments
accounts, suggesting that part of the increase in external debt goes
unrecorded in the balance of payments accounts. In the cases where a
discrepency arises, the unrecorded increase in external liabilities

must correspond to an underestimate of balancing transactions. Dooley
(1986) assumes that all of the underestimated balancing transactions
consist of private sector acquisition of foreign assets. He therefore

adds the difference between each year's change in external debt as
reported by the World Bank and the increase as recorded by the balance

of payments accounts to his estimate of the increase in private sector

foreign assets. He then computes a market interest rate for each
country's assets and calculates the stock of external assets that

would give rise to the level of investment income recorded in the
balance of payments accounts at this market interest rate. The
difference between the two measures of external assets is his measure
of capital flight.

Unlike any of the studies discussed above, Dooley (1986) and Khan
and Ul Haque (1986) attempt to distinguish capital flight from

"normal" capital flows that correspond to ordinary portfolio
diversification and business activities of domestic residents. Both
point out that looking only at the gross increase in external assets

as a measure of capital flight may give misleading results since in
many countries that are generally recognized not to be experiencing
capita]. flight, domestic residents acquire both foreign assets and
14

foreign liabilities. That is, there are generally two-way capital
flows between countries and to identify one side of these flows as

capital flight would be seriously misleading. Their solution is to
identify foreign assets that do not generate reported income as
capital flight because the presumption is that if the income is
unrecorded, the motive of the investor is to place funds beyond the

control of the authorities. Both claim that such capital is "lost to
the country" and is identified as flight capital.
The problem of distinguishing "normal capital flows" from "capital
flight" was discussed earlier. Does the solution adopted by Dooley
(1986) and Khan and Ul Haque (1986) succeed in making this
distinction? If this capital is "lost to the country" while owned by
residents of the country, it must be that these foreign assets
represent a welfare loss and should be distinguished from those that

do not. If the problem associated with capital flight involves an
externality of the sort described above (in which the social rate of
return on capital invested domestically exceeds the private rate
of return on such investments or in which there is a shadow value of
foreign exchange that exceeds the market price), it seems that any
movement of funds abroad that otherwise would have been invested at

home should be considered in a measure of capital flight. The same
would be true if the nature of the distortion is the absense of

credibility on the part of the policy maker. In each of these cases,
whether or not the income from foreign investments is reported or not

seems irrelevant. One may wish to distinguish repatriated investment
income from reinvested income on these grounds, as noted earlier,

however. If on the other hand, the problem that is addressed is the

15

erosion of the domestic tax base and the need to levy taxes
on other
reported income that have less desirable allocatjve or distributional
effects, their definition seems to be the natural one.
An alternative means of

distinguishing capita], flight from
"normal" capital flows might be to examine the extent to which
private
sector capital flows are two—way flows

or one—way flows. In a

in which private sector capital account credits
greatly
exceed private sector capital account debits, one might judge that
capita], is fleeing and that the "nomal" two-way flow of funds is not
occuri.ng. While this means of distinguishing flight
capital from
situation

"normal"
measure

capital flows might be conceptually useful in devising a

at capital flight corresponding to Walter's (1987)
definition,

given the obvious data

problems, it S

be implemented.

difficult to see how it could

III. Empirical Results
In this section we present estimates of capital flight based on a
common database and a standard time period and obtained using the

definitions and methods above. We do this with several goals in mind.
First, we will be able to show in a concise way the range of estimates

of capital flight implied by the alternate definitions discussed

above. Second, by comparing our estimates with those reported in
previous work we will be able to determine the extent to which the
estimates of capital flight are sensitive to differences in data
sources. Finally, we will be able to determine if the different
defintions adopted by the World Bank (1985), Erbe (1985), Morgan

Guaranty (1986), and dine (1986) give rise to significantly different
estimates of capital flight.

Our results show that in some cases important differences arise
when we compare our estimates of capital flight to those obtained by
others when using the same definitions but somewhat different data

sources. On the other hand, the differences in definitions adopted by
previous authors make only marginal differences in most cases. We also
consider adjustments to the capital flight estimates to reflect
capital flight in the form of mis-invoicing of trade flows and
valuation changes on external debt due to exchange rate changes.

Tables 1 — 6 present summary measures of changes in external debt
and some balance of payments aggregates for six countries from 1976 to
1984. The six countries considered are Argentina, Brazil, Korea,

Mexico, the Philippines, and Venezuela. In addition, these tables
present several estimates of capital flight obtained using a single,
consistent data set and several definitions of capital flight
described previously.2!

We have adopted the sign convention used in
17

the balance—of—payments accounts. In order to facilitate comparisons

across the various estimates we present totals for 1976 to 1982 as
well as for 1976 to 1984.!-!

Several conclusions emerge immediately from these tables.

First,

the extent of capital flight according to all measures is greater for
Argentina, Mexico, and Venezuela than for the other three countries,

with Mexico leading the list. In these three countries, the estimates
of capial flight are large not only in absolute terms but also in
relation to the increase in external debt accumulated over the period
considered. The estimated degree of capital flight from Korea and the

Philippines is very small. Regardless of the definition employed,
countries estimated to have experienced considerable capital flight
are those in which the increase in external debt greatly exceeds the
cumulative current account deficits. Second, the smallest estimate of

capital flight is generally obtained using Cuddington's definition.
This is not surprising since he considers only short—term capital
flows. Third, there is generally very little difference between the

estimates obtained using the Morgan definition and those obtained

using that of the World Bank and Erbe./ Fourth, the estimates of
capital flight provided by Dooley and by Khan and Ui Hague show that
in most cases not only has the private sector acquired a substantial
volume of foreign assets, but also a substantial fraction of these
assets does not generate income that is reported in the balance of

payments accounts. Finally, in many cases the estimates presented
here are very close to the estimates presented by other authors.
The most striking exception to this last point is found when
Erbe's reported capital flight estimates are compared to our estimates

18

based on her definition. The bulk of the difference can be traced to
dif fences in estiniates of the increase in external debt.i/ A fairly
sizable difference can also be found between the Morgan estimates of
capital flight from Brazil and our estimate based on the Morgan
definition. The source of this difference seems to be in different
estimates of the change in reserves and foreign assets of the banking
system. These differences suggest that the estimates of capital flight
are sensitive to the data sources employed, and are especially
sensitive to differences in estimates of external debt.

A few remarks about individual countries are in order. Argentina
experienced substantial capital flight between 1976 and 1982 according

to all measures. However, the data also show that no additional
capital flight occured in 1983 and 1984. The estimates of capital
flight from Brazil, while considerably smaller than for the other
Latin American countries, show substantial variation across
definitions. All estimates except those based on Cuddington's
definition point to a much smaller volume of capital flight between
1976 and 1982 than between 1976 and 1984, and indicate that capital
flight of approximately $6 billion occured in 1983 and 1984.
Venezuela, like Mexico, is estimated to have experienced sizable
capital flight both between 1976 and 1982 and during 1983 and 1984.
Interestingly, the estimates of capital flight during 1983 and 1984

based on all definitions except dine's and Cuddington's indicate that
capital flight during those two years exceeds the increase in external
debt by a factor of approximately four.

The most interesting case presented here is that of Mexico. In
addition to the large volume of capital flight experienced by Mexico,

the estimated increase in 1983 and 1984 is also striking. The
19

adjustments to the Morgan definition of capital flight proposed by
Cline lead to a substantial downward revision of the degree of capital
flight both over the entire period and over the 1976—1982 period.
However, since the idea behind these adjustments is to determine the
extent to which exchange controls have been effective, it would be

useful to concentrate on the estimated capital flight during 1983 and

1984. While these adjustments reduce the degree of capital flight by
approximately $6 billion for 1983 and 1984, capital flight of

approximately $12 billion is estimated to have occured during this
period even if the Cline adjustments are used.
One possible reason that the capital flight estimates may be

somewhat misleading is that changes in the dollar value of external

debt are employed. If a significant fraction of external debt is
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, then the dollar
value of that debt will change as exchange rates change. For example,

if part of a country's external debt is denominated in DM and the U.S.
dollar appreciates relative to the DM, the dollar value of the debt

will fall. As a result, the capital flight extimates derived from
changes in the dollar value debt will be understated when the dollar
appreciates as it did from 1980 through 1984.

Similarly, these

valuation changes will overstate the extent of capital flight when the

dollar depreciates. How quantitatively important are these valuation
changes? It is difficult to determine the precise magnitude of these
valuation changes since time series on the currency composition of

external debt are not readily available. In order to shed some light
on the potential magnitude of these valuation changes, we have
calculated some hypothetical valuation changes assuming that 10% of

20

debt is denominated in DM and then assuming that 10% of debt is
denominated in yen.
The hypothetical valuation changes on external debt are presented

in Table 7. As can be seen in Table 7A, if 10% of external debt is DM
denominated, the increase in the dollar value of the debt understates

slightly the level of new borrowing undertaken by the country. The
capital flight estimates based on these figures will then also be

slightly underestimated. The calculations reported in Table 7B
indicate that the size of valuation changes that result if 10% of
external debt is yen denominated are even smaller than is the case in

Table 7A. In neither case is the size of valuation changes sufficient
to result in substantial underestimates or serious overestimates of
capital flight, except in the unlikely case that a very large fraction
of external debt is denominated in currencies other than U.s. dollars.

A comparison of partner country data on trade flows can be used to
consider two additional potential sources of mismeasurement of capital

flight. The first of these possibilities is that balance of payments
data are of such dubious quality so as to warrant a broad degree of

skepticism about any particular number that is derived from them. The
second of the possibilities is that additional capital flight occurs
through systematic mis-invoicing of imports and exports. Gulati (1987)

presents estimates of the degree to which capital flight estimates

could be adjusted to reflect mis-invoicing of trade flows)I
There are several reasons for differences to arise in partner
country data on trade flows, quite apart from any systematic
falsification of invoices. One of these, problems arising from timing
lags due to transit, can produce differences for two reasons. First,
goods shipped and recorded by the exporting country in one year may
21

not arrive and get recorded by the importing country until the
following year. Second, when a country records these trade data in
local currency, timing lags may result in their conversion into
dollars at different exchange rates in the importing and exporting
countries. A second major source of differences

partner country

reports of trade flows arises from mistaken allocation of the
destination of exports or the origin of imports. Such mistakes can
arise quite easily due to transit trading, re—export, or the
participation of third-country merchants.

In order to attempt to sort out the extent to which the
discrepancies in partner country trade data are due to systematic
faisfication of invoices and to poor quality data, we have carried out
a number of calculations that can be compared to those reported in

Gulatj (1987). In Table 8 we examine trade between the U.S. and four
industrial countries, Canada, France, Germany, and the U.K./ As

Table 8A indicates, reported exports of these countries to the U.S.
correspond very closely to reported U.S. imports from these countries.
The ratios of these reported magnitudes are generally much closer to

one than is the found in Gulati (1987). on the other hand, sizable
differences are found in Table 8B between reported French and German
imports from the U.S. and reported u.s. exports to these countries.

These differences suggest either systematic overinvoicing of imports
by these countries or, perhaps, may simply indicate that the
destination of shipments from the U.S. to the EEC countries may not be

accurately ascribed to the proper country. In any event, the size of
these differences is striking and raises questions about the general
quality of the data.

22

A second set of comparisons is found in Table 9, where trade data
for five European countries with Germany are examined. Intra—European
trade data provide an interesting benchmark comparion since the data
problems described earlier should be minimized due to short transport
time, relatively stable intra—European exchange rates, and the absence
of intra—EEC trade restrictions. A fairly close correspondence between
partner country reports is found in Table 9, with the exception of
French—German trade since approximately 1980. There is evidence of
underinvoicing of exports, perhaps indicating capital flight from
France. On the other hand, this apparent underinvoicing of exports
corresponds to apparent underinvoicing of imports during the same
period. Since the ratios in both 9A and 9B are nearly always less than
one, it seems that either a systematic bias may be present in the
German partner country trade data or the CIF/FOB adjustment which uses
average ratios for each country overstate the corrections that needs to
be made to intra—European trade.
The final set of comparisons is found in Table 10, where we
examine partner country trade flows between some Latin American
countries. The first of these comparisons is between Mexico and
Brazil. No striking differences are found between the partner country
reports in this case, especially when compared to the size of the
differences found in the Mexico—U.S. and Mexico—industrial countries
comparisons reported by Gulati. This would suggest that systematic
falsification of invoices rather than other data problems accounts for
the differences found by Gulati for Mexico. Next, consider the
Venezuela—Brazil comparison and the Argentina—Brazil comparison. In
the first of these we find that there is a relatively close
correspondence between the partner country reports, except in 1980 and
23

1981, when reported Brazilian exports fall considerably short of
reported Venezuelan imports, and in 1978, when reported Venezuelan

exports fall short of reported Brazilian imports. On the other hand,
large differences are found between the partner country reports for
Argentina and Brazil. Here we find that, in several years, reported
Argentine exports to Brazil fall considerably short of reported
Brazilian imports from Argentina, while in others the correspondence
is relatively close. We also find that reported Argentine imports from
Brazil fall short of reported Brazilian exports to Argentina, although
the difference is smaller.
It seems then that both data problems and systematic falsification
of invoices account for the differences in partner country reports of

trade flows. The differences reflect, at least in part, capital
flight that may not be detected in the estimates discussed above. To
the extent that the differences point to underreported trade flows,
they must also reflect underrecorded balancing items.

If we assume

that the underrecorded balancing items are increases in private sector
foreign assets, then the capital flight estimates discussed above will

be underestimates. If we add import overinvoicing and export
underinvoicing, and assume that the difference reflect capital flight
rather than other data problems, as Gulati (1987) shows, the estimates
of capital flight are generally reduced since import underinvoicing
generally dominates export underinvoicing.

24

IV. Policy Implications and Concluding Remarks

Our objective in this paper has been to survey the alternative
definitions of capital flight that have been offered in the recent
literature. At the conceptual level, we have noted that the definition
of capital flight requires a somewhat arbitrary distinction between
normal capital outflows and those that are labeled as capital flight.

Any specification of capital flight ought to be consistent with the
economic or policy question under consideration. Most current policy
issues presume a nationalistic point of view in which capital flight
reduces national welfare. Policy decisions will be aided to the extent
that a definition of capital flight represents a good proxy for the
measure of national welfare loss.

At the empirical level, we have attempted to replicate several of
the leading definitions of capital flight using a common database.
Doing so illustrates the range of estimates of capital flight that are
possible, and how alternative definitions and databases contribute to
the dispersion of estimates. Our results show that for some countries,

differences in definitions or databases may be substantial, causing
some estimates of capital flight to be positive and others negative.
The change in a country's external debt position plays a major role in
several definitions of capital flight. Our results suggest that
revisions to external debt figures and differences across data sources
may account for up to $5 -$10 billion of the difference in capital
flight estimates.

The evidence suggests that capital flight is often a large
absolute number. It is sometimes large relative to the stock of
external debt. Capital flight is probably always small relative to the
stock of domestic assets or other measures of net national wealth.
25

What, then, is the relevance of these capital flight estimates for
policy makers?
In balance of payments analysis, it is well-known that the set of
international transactions are interdependent. Consequently, to take

the current U.S. case as an example, it is unreasonable to hope that
if the United States imposed a tariff and reduced its imports from

Japan by $10 billion that the U.S. current account balance would
improve by $10 billion. Because the U.S. current account surplus
equals the sum of net private U.S. savings plus the U.S. fiscal
surplus, we need to know the impact of the tariff on these variables
to determine its net effect on the current account. To make this
calculation requires a general equilibrium model of the economy.
Policy making vis-a-vis capital flight is much the same. It is
unreasonable to claim that if $10 billion in capital flight could be
reversed, then the country's external debt needs would be reduced by

$10 bi11ion./ At a minimum, this conclusion would assume that the
alternative use of the $10 billion was toward domestic investment. But
if underlying forces in the economy were unchanged, domestic residents

might be inclined to spend their $10 billion on foreign imports, or to
convert these funds into gold or other commodities to preserve
purchasing power.

From these examples it seems clear that capital flight is best
thought of as a !y!ptom of underlying economic forces rather than a
cause of national welfare losses. To understand the role of capital
flight, its impact on the national economy and the welfare gains from
reversing it, an appropriate definition of capital flight must be

imbedded in a complete model of the economy.

26

A current issue of concern is the impact that capital flight might
have on the willingness of commercial banks to increase their lending
to LDCs. Surely if domestic residents are unwilling to invest in their
own countries, the argument goes, then commercial banks should be
unwilling also. And the argument can be bolstered by the statistical
relationship between new borrowings over the last several years and
increases in capital flight.

But this current argument can be easily refuted.I First, we
would expect domestic residents to hold a diversified portfolio of
international investments, even during normal times. As transaction
costs decline, we would expect domestic residents to reduce their
exposure to country specific disturbances. Extreme risk aversion or
market uncertainty would enhance the attractiveness of offshore
investments. During a crisis period, an expected discontinuity in
financial policy could lead to a run on international reserves to
engage in capital flight.

Second, commercial banks might be modeled as well-diversified
professional lenders. In a corporate reorganization, banks have the
power to force a change in management policies, to set covenants to
protect their self-interests, to take an equity participation for
enhancing returns, and to base their decisions on information that may
not be available to the general public.

Thus commercial banks might be in a more desirable situation than
individual investors --

there

is a possibility that the interest rate

needed to draw in additional bank lending is insufficient to retain
the marginal domestic investor. We could easily envisage a model in
which additional bank lending, perhaps accompanied by an IMF program,
was taken as a signal that banks had re—appraised economic conditions
27

and had extracted certain pledges regarding the conduct of monetary
and fiscal policy. In such a case, fresh bank lending might be
accompanied by a reversal of capital flight.
The estimates of capital flight presented in this paper confirm
that world capital markets are becoming more highly integrated. In the
human capital literature, it was argued that given the mobility of
factors, human capital would migrate if it did not receive a
competitive market wage. Now the analogy is that financial
transactions and financial capital will migrate also if domestic
depositors and investors are not offered financial services with
competitive risks and returns. In this environment, capital flight
ought to be viewed as a symptom of underlying economic problems,
rather than as the source of the problem.

28

FOOTNOTES
1.

Cuddington (1986) reminds us that human capital could be included

in a measure of capital flight. Indeed, in the l960s, the "brain
drain" was viewed by some as a serious factor detrimental to the
economic development of some countries. During that debate,
nationalists (e.g. Patinkin (1968]) stressed the distributional
effects of capital movements thereby rejecting "the world" as the
appropriate unit for welfare maximization. Internationalists (e.g.
Johnson [1968]) argued that the brain drain was largely a symptom

of other source country policies, exacerbated by the increasing
integration of labor markets and the mobility of well—educated
people. The current debate on capital flight echoes many of the
arguments used regarding the brain drain.

2. In a slightly different situation, the theoretical construct may
be well-defined (e.g. the money supply, the labor supply, the
price level), but there is no easy way to operationalize the
concept. Here the solution may be to pick a proxy variable (e.g.
M2, or men and women above the age of 16 who are actively seeking
employment, or a sample of prices of consumer goods and services)

which the policy maker can influence or about which he collects
data.

3. United States policies to stem capital outflows in the 1960s such
as the Interest Rate Equalization Tax (1963) and the Voluntary
Foreign Credit Restraint program (1968) were not viewed as highly
successful. The Eurocurrency and Eurobonds markets quickly
developed over this period to expedite capital outflows and the
of fshore demand for funds.

29

4. Indeed, it is in the context of discussing the degree of capital
flight in Mexico after the imposition of exchange controls that
Cline suggests these adjustments.

5. Some "real" assets, like real estate are considerably less liquid,
however, and funds invested in these are less likely to respond
quickly to changes in Conditions in the investor's home country.
6. We are indebted to Alain Ize and Don Lessard for suggesting this
point.

7. A description of the data sources and tables containing detailed
data used to generate these tables is found in the appendix. The
adjustments to the Morgan-world Bank-Erbe estimates

suggest by

Cline are not relevant for all countries and are presented here

only for the purpose of comparison. We will discuss the
importance of his adjustments when we turn to a discussion of
Mexico.

8. There are three exception, as is noted in the footnotes to the
tables. The World Bank numbers are for 1979-1982 rather than for
1976—1982. Dooley does not provide sufficient data for us to

recreate his market interest rate so that the estimates presented
are his. In addition, he considers only 1978 to 1984. Finally,
Khan and Ul Hague use Dooley's estimates.

As Cuddington (1987)

points out, when calculating these totals we ignore the effect of
possible interest compounding and hence the total probably

understates the increase in the value of assets held abroad.

9. The only exception to this is found in the case of Korea, where
the estimates of capital flight are reduced from $6.1 billion to
$2.8 billion and $7.6 billion to $3.5 billion when the banking

system's acquisition of foreign assets is excluded. A slight but
30

noticable reduction is also found in the case of the Philippines.

10. Erbe (1985) uses OECD estimates of external debt, while World Bank
estimates are used here.
11. Partner country trade data have been used to examine the accuracy
of balance of payments data by Morgensterh (1974) and to infer the
extent of capital flight effected through mis-invoicing by
Bhagwati (1964), Naya and Morgan (1969), and Bhagwati, Krueger,
and Wibulswasdi (1974). Gulati (1987) provides updated estimates.
12. The trade data are taken from the IMF's Direction of Trade
Yearbook. Since exports are reported fob while imports are
reported cif, the import data are adjusted using each country's
cif/fob ratio reported in International Financial Statistics so
that both imports and exports are fob for the purpose of the
analysis undertaken here.

13. Perhaps this claim is reasonable in the case of official
misconduct, when public funds are moved offshore rather than
recycled into the domestic economy. See Erbe (1985, p.268) for an
example.

14. An analytical model by Diwan (1986) leads to a similar argument.
Diwan posits that a country may be engaged in very high risk
projects, and so domestic residents will acquire foreign assets to
spread their risk. If external funding is less than adequate, a

demand for insurance services is still present which domestic
residents attempt to satisfy by placing funds offshore. The model
predicts that increased commercial bank lending to LDCs should
lead to a reduction in capital flight.
