Local Government and Old-Age Support in the New Deal

ABSTRACT
A key question in the design of public assistance to the needy is how allocation of responsibility
for funding and decision-making across different levels of government influences the level and
type of assistance provided. The New Deal era was a period in which this allocation changed
significantly in the United States, as provision of public assistance shifted from local
governments to states and the federal government, accompanied by a large increase in
government transfer payments. Focusing on assistance to the elderly and using variation in state
laws governing the division of funding between local and state governments for the Old Age
assistance (OAA) Program, this paper investigates the responsiveness of OAA payments and
recipiency to local government funding shares. Payments per elderly resident were significantly
lower in states with higher local funding shares, driven largely by reductions in recipiency. The
baseline results suggest that had local governments needed to fund half of OAA payments in
1939, on the lower end of local funding shares prior to the New Deal, the share of the elderly
receiving OAA would have been 5 percent rather than 22 percent, and perhaps even lower. More
speculative results suggest that greater local funding led to lower representation of blacks among
OAA recipients relative to their share of the population, particularly in the South.

Introduction

A key question in the design of public assistance to the needy is how allocation of responsibility
for funding and decision-making across different levels of government influences the level and type
of assistance provided. Theoretical work, such as Brown and Oates (1987), has investigated some
of the efficiency properties of providing assistance at the state or local level, as opposed to the
national level.1 Economists have explored this question empirically in modern contexts such as
the welfare reform of the 1990s, which, Ziliak (2015) suggests, may have contributed to declining
levels of cash assistance after the reform by raising the marginal cost to states of providing cash
assistance.2 This question is particularly topical given recent proposals to convert many assistance
programs into block grants to states (Ryan, 2014). In this paper, I investigate this question in the
context of government assistance to the elderly during the New Deal era.
A large literature has investigated fiscal federalism in the New Deal (see, e.g., Fishback and
Wallis, 2012). The New Deal marked not only a dramatic increase in governmental transfers to
the elderly, but also a shift from local provision of old-age support to increased federal and state
involvement, as part of the broader shift of government expenditures from the local to national
level (Wallis, 1984, 1991). Prior to 1933, assistance to the needy elderly, and to poor in general,
was almost entirely a local affair in both funding and decision making (Wallis and Oates, 1998).
State governments had gradually begun to take on a greater role in the 1920s, but even in 1934,
when 26 states had passed laws providing for some state role in old-age assistance, in only 6 states
did counties fund less than a quarter of payments. The role of states changed dramatically after the
passage of the Social Security Act, which provided federal matching funds for state old-age support
programs through the Old Age Assistance Program (OAA) and encouraged a shift of responsibility
from local to state governments. By 1939, four years after the passage of the Social Security Act,
1

Oates (1999) discusses this literature more broadly.
Specifically, the 1990s welfare reform shifted welfare from open-ended matching grants for states under Aid to
Family with Dependent Children (AFDC) to block grants under Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF).
Relevant also is the literature on the flypaper effect, the observation that block grants tend to increase expenditure
on their stated purpose more than non-grant income (Inman (2008) provides a relatively recent review). As Moffitt
(1984) emphasizes, here it is important to consider the difference between matching grants, whose effects are not
due to ‘flypaper’ effects, and block grants. Recent work, such as Singhal (2008) and Knight (2002), emphasizes the
importance of political considerations in the analysis of flypaper effects.

all states had passed laws and in more than half of them, the county share of OAA payments was
zero percent.
The main empirical analysis investigates what role reduced local funding shares played in the
observed increase in the level of old-age support. Facilitating the analysis is the fact that even in
1939, there was considerable variation across states in the degree of local involvement in funding
OAA. The main empirical estimates use this cross-state policy variation to investigate the relationship between statutory local funding shares and the amount of OAA provided in 1939. Because
state policies were correlated with levels of need, and levels of need also influenced the level of relief
provided, the empirical strategy follows Fetter and Lockwood (2016) in focusing on comparisons
across state borders in order to control flexibly for differences in aggregate shocks and population characteristics. The estimates indicate an economically and statistically significant negative
relationship between local funding shares and OAA payments per person, driven primarily by a
reduction in the share of the elderly receiving OAA and, to a much lesser extent, by reductions in
payments per OAA recipient. The magnitude of the results is substantial, suggesting that the reduction in local funding was an essential part of the growth of government old-age support. Under
the Social Security Act, the national government funded 50 percent of old-age assistance payments
(up to a cap), and the remainder was funded by states or localities. The baseline specification
suggests that had counties been required to fund the other half of old-age assistance payments, the
OAA recipiency rate in 1939 – measured as the share of those 65 and above receiving OAA – would
have been 5 percent, rather than the observed level of 22 percent.
Several pieces of evidence support the interpretation of these estimates as the causal effect of
local funding shares. Once comparisons are made only across state borders, other observable policy
characteristics do not explain the negative relationship between local funding shares and recipiency
or payments, and if anything conditioning on observable policy variables tends to magnify the
results. Moreover, changes in local funding shares between 1937 and 1939 are associated with
changes in recipiency and payments that are nearly identical to those estimated from the 1939
cross-section.
Closely related to the shift away from local funding of old-age assistance was a shift in decision-

2

making from the local level to the state level. I document that the responsiveness of OAA payments
to local funding shares was most pronounced in states in which local governments, rather than
states, had the final say in determining whether to provide assistance to a given case.3 The
greater responsiveness to local funding requirements in states where localities had more influence
on decision-making accords with the interpretation of the main estimates as the effect of local
funding. Moreover, allowing this flexibility is important for understanding the effects of changing
both local funding requirements and the level at which decisions were made. Allowing this flexibility
yields results that suggest that had all decisions been made by local governments that funded 50
percent, the OAA recipiency rate would have been 1 percent rather than 22 percent.
To the extent that local funding reduced OAA recipiency, a natural extension is to ask how
it influenced the composition of recipients. I focus on one dimension of this question: how local
funding influenced blacks’ receipt of OAA. The basic difficulty in answering this question is that
there is no large source of microdata from this period that directly measures OAA receipt. However,
in a spirit similar to Fetter and Lockwood (2016), I show that the 1940 Census question on receipt
of non-wage income can be used to construct a reasonable proxy for OAA recipiency at the county
level, using the complete-count Census data for 1940 (Ruggles et al., 2015). After validating this
measure, I use it to investigate the relationship between local funding and the representation of
blacks among OAA recipients relative to their share in the population. I find suggestive evidence
that in the country as a whole, local funding was associated with greater underrepresentation of
blacks among OAA recipients relative to their share of the population. While somewhat sensitive to
specification, the evidence is also suggestive that this relationship is significantly larger in the South,
both economically and statistically. These findings, while necessarily speculative given that they
are based not on observation of OAA receipt but rather receipt of any non-wage income, suggest
that the shift away from local funding may have improved access of blacks to old-age support.
This paper relates most closely to the literature on fiscal federalism in the New Deal: for
example, Wallis (1984), Wallis (1991), and Wallis (2000), in addition to Fishback and Wallis (2012).
3

Wallis (1981) provides a model of local relief budgets in his analysis of relief earlier in the New Deal, under the
Federal Emergency Relief Administration, and discusses the importance of accounting for which level of government
actually makes relief decisions.

3

In large part this literature has focused on explaining the decline of local government expenditures
relative to state and national government expenditures by measuring the responses of state and local
spending to shifts in national spending.4 It has not, however, directly measured the responsiveness
of spending to changes in the marginal cost to local or state governments of providing assistance, in
the spirit of the broader literature on the responsiveness of lower-level governments to changes in
intergovernmental matching grants (e.g., Baicker, 2005). One reason this question has been difficult
to address is that while most New Deal programs required some state or local funding, in many
programs there was no explicit matching formula, or the requirements were enforced unequally
across states (Fishback and Wallis, 2012). OAA offers a case amenable to empirical study, as it
followed a statutory matching formula for the division of funding across each of the three levels
of government. Although some have observed broadly that local funding requirements led to less
assistance (e.g., Costa, 1998, 1999), no work has attempted to quantify the aggregate importance
of these requirements, and the magnitude of the estimates is striking: the shift away from local
provision of support could account for most of the rise in old-age support over the second half of
the 1930s, which itself was the major period of increase before the expansion of Social Security in
the 1950s.
This paper also contributes to the literatures on the politics of race in the New Deal and the
role of race in support for transfer payments. A significant body of literature has examined the
relationship between race and the public assistance provisions of the Social Security Act in the
New Deal Era, stressing that racial discrimination or the goal of keeping agricultural wages low
was behind the South’s effort to ensure a high degree of state discretion in the administration of
OAA (e.g., Quadagno, 1988; Alston and Ferrie, 1999; Lieberman, 2001). It is also the case that
prior to the New Deal, cities with more blacks had lower relief levels overall and less public relief in
particular (Fox, 2010). Most closely related to the focus of this paper, Quadagno (1988) suggests
that local control of relief contributed to exclusion of blacks from OAA in the South, although she
does not focus on local funding per se.
4

Other work documents similar shifts in regulatory functions of government over this period: Knittel (2006), for
example, discusses the shift of electricity regulation away from local governments to state governments. Fishback and
Wallis (2012) note the tendency of regulatory programs during the New Deal to be national programs.

Background on OAA

2.1

The federal structure of OAA

Prior to the early 20th century, poor relief in the United States was largely based on the legacy
of the English Poor Laws. Support for the destitute, including the poor elderly, was seen first as
a responsibility of the family, and second as a responsibility of local government (Maxwell, 1946,
p. 114). The first state laws providing for assistance to the elderly were in 1915, and a handful
of other states, largely in the West and Midwest, passed laws during the 1920s; as of 1929, seven
states had old-age assistance laws in effect. These laws were part of a broader spread of state
legislation providing for aid to “special classes” (in addition to the aged, aid to the blind and to
widowed mothers of dependent children) with the goals of avoiding the stigma of traditional poor
relief and increasing administrative efficiency of the programs through greater state involvement
(Geddes, 1937, p. 2-4). As Costa (1998) notes, political pressure for greater state involvement in
old-age support had begun to grow in the 1920s, but became significantly stronger after the onset
of the Great Depression, as older workers became unemployed at particularly high rates and many
private pension plans were discontinued or cut benefits. As a result, many more states passed
old-age assistance laws in the early years of the Depression. Nevertheless, prior to the passage
of the Social Security Act in 1935, most programs for old-age assistance remained small and had
relatively modest state administrative or fiscal involvement. As of 1934, when 28 states had passed
old-age assistance laws, in 19 states counties or towns had to supply at least half of assistance funds
(Cahn, 1934).
This system of significant local funding was ill-suited to insure against aggregate shocks, since
negative shocks would both reduce revenues and increase the level of need. The inability of localities to provide sufficient funds to meet the need for relief became apparent early in the Depression.
Although states had begun to provide a greater share of assistance by the early 1930s, state governments themselves faced severe financial difficulties (Federal Works Agency, 1942, p. 2). The initial
response at the national level to the fiscal problems of states and localities was the creation of
the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA). Between 1933 and 1935, FERA distributed

5

federal funds to states, which then passed funds on to local governments. These funds were used, in
part, to support assistance to the needy elderly. However, FERA retained significant discretion in
the distribution of federal funds across states, leading to political battles and a compromise in 1935
that created the structure that persisted through the remainder of the New Deal (Wallis, 1991).
Part of this compromise, embodied in the OAA provisions of the Social Security Act, was that the
federal funds for old-age support would be allocated across states according to a strict matching
formula for state OAA programs.
Specifically, under the Social Security Act, federal matching funds were provided for state OAA
programs, as well as for two other “categorical” relief programs, Aid to Dependent Children (ADC)
and Aid to the Blind (AB), under closed end matching grants. The federal government matched
combined state and local spending up to a specified cap per case. The provisions of the Social
Security Act encouraged a shift from local to state funding and administration of OAA in addition
to providing federal funding. In order to receive federal matching funds, a state OAA program
had to involve some state financial participation and to be administered, or at least overseen,
by a state-level agency (Lansdale et al., 1939, p. 18). It was also significant, as Wallis (1984)
emphasizes, that federal matching funds were transferred to state governments, and not directly to
local governments.
It is important that by 1939, the division of fiscal responsibility for OAA payments, up to the
federal matching cap, was based on fixed shares for each of the three levels of government. That is,
given a determination that a particular case would receive assistance, the percentage of the payment
to each case provided by each level of government was specified by the state OAA law. Federal
matching funds went to the state, which was responsible for distributing funds to local governments
if the state did not disburse assistance to recipients directly (Gordon and Israeli, 1939).5 For OAA
in the late 1930s, which is the period examined here, up to a cap of $30 per month (roughly $450
in 2010 dollars) the federal funding share was 50 percent and the remaining 50 percent was divided
between the state and local governments. In practice, the breakdown of source of funds for OAA
5

Earlier in the 1930s, some states did not have explicit formulas determining the shares of payments paid by states
and localities. As emphasized by Wallis (1981) and Wallis (1984), in cases where this matching was not explicit, the
fact that the federal matching money went to the state weakened incentives for local expenditures.

6

payments could deviate slightly from the statutory percentages (for example, U.S. Social Security
Board (1940c) reports the realized shares by state for 1938-39). Such deviations could arise, for
example, if payments were made above the federal matching cap, or in cases where states used
special emergency funds to increase their contribution. However, these differences were generally
quite small.
As a result of the shift towards greater federal and state assumption of relief expenditures, by
1939 the local role in funding relief had diminished considerably. All states had OAA programs in
operation, and 27 states had OAA laws specifying a local funding share of zero percent. Figure 1
documents that in the remaining states, statutory local shares varied from 7.5% to 35%; Kansas
was the only state with a local share above 25%.6 These local funding shares are the key variable of
interest in the analysis below: it is worth noting that given the constant federal share, the analysis
does not hold the state share constant, but rather estimates the effect of changing the allocation of
fiscal responsibility between state and local governments.
Observers at the time noted that the reasons for different division of fiscal responsibility between
state and local governments varied from state to state (e.g., Lansdale et al., 1939, p. 18). In general,
allocation of fiscal responsibility was made jointly with a decision about allocation of administrative
responsibility, with arguments that exclusive state financing would lead to too much control being
taken out of the hands of local governments (Lansdale et al., 1939, p. 216). But even states with
similar division of administrative responsibility varied in their allocation of fiscal responsibility for
OAA.
Despite the shift in financial responsibility away from local governments, it was still noted at
the time that in those states requiring local funding, local governments were often unable to make
their required payments for OAA (e.g., Lansdale et al., 1939, pp. 220-1). Gordon and Israeli
(1939) report that in such cases, some state governments would pay the county share out of state
funds, sometimes with provisions for repayment. Other states had special equalization funds that
were meant to address shortfalls in localities’ ability to pay, or used other already-existing means
of addressing fiscal distress of local governments. Provisions of this sort likely smoothed out some

7

differences across counties. Nevertheless, these equalization funds were sometimes suspended, or
state funds were not provided to pay the county share, and in these cases payments were cut;
Gordon and Israeli (1939) note that local funding remained a constraint on provision of OAA.
At the same time as funding shifted away from the local level to the federal and state levels,
assistance to the elderly expanded rapidly. Between 1935 and 1940, the number of recipients of
old-age assistance rose from under 400,000 to more than 2 million. By 1940, 22 percent of the
population 65 and above received OAA, and received an average annual payment of $232, about
25 percent of the median wage and salary earnings for 60-64 year old male wage earners in 1939.
An important element in thinking about the impact of changing local funding of OAA is what
influence local governments had on decisions regarding OAA eligibility and payments. In nearly all
states there was some role for local government: for example, an applicant for relief would submit
an application to a local office, and it was often a local agency that would investigate eligibility
and need and prepare a recommendation on whether aid should be provided, and in what amount
(Lansdale et al., 1939, p. 20). In all states there was also some state supervision. Within these
boundaries, however, there was a fair amount of variation in the influence of local government
that is difficult to measure precisely. The measure of local influence used in the analysis below is
whether the final decision in an OAA case was made by a local official or by a state official. As
illustrated by a comparison of Figure 1 to Figure 2, the latter of which indicates the states where
final decisions were made by local officials, local final decisions often, but did not always, coincide
with local funding of OAA.

2.2

Other features of OAA

States had considerable leeway within the broad requirements set by the Social Security Act for
federal matching grants, and there was a fair amount of variation in the nature of eligibility and
payments under different states’ laws. As of the end of 1939, which is the focus of the analysis,
the common eligibility requirements across states were that a recipient must otherwise have little
income (the amount varied across states) and be above some minimum age threshold (65 in most
states, 70 in a few). Some also required US citizenship or long-term residency, or required that

8

recipient have no legally responsible relatives able to provide support. All required some period of
residency in the state before claiming OAA.
Asset tests, such as a dollar value on the amount of property than a recipient could own, were also
common, with a subset of these states excluding from consideration the value of a recipient’s own
home. Although appearing restrictive, these limitations may in fact have been intended to liberalize
eligibility by creating more formal eligibility rules, preventing people from being deemed ineligible
if they had less than the specified amount of property (U.S. Social Security Board, 1940b, p. 157).
Relatedly, some states also included provisions that gave either state or local governments a claim
on the recipient’s property. Anecdotal evidence suggests, as might be expected, that the presence
of such claims reduced take-up among those eligible for OAA, even in states that did not strictly
enforce such claims (Lansdale et al., 1939, pp. 94-96). But as Lansdale et al. (1939) note, claims
on property, like property limitations, may have sometimes been intended to liberalize eligibility;
whereas some relief agencies may have otherwise restricted relief to those without property, these
claims may have allowed elderly owning property that was not easily liquidated, such as a home,
to borrow against its value.
In most states, OAA resembled an income or consumption floor: a state or local official evaluated
the needs and resources of an applicant, and if the applicant was deemed eligible, the excess of needs
over resources provided the basis for determining the payment. Maximum allowable payments
varied across states, with a range from $15 to $45 per month. A handful of states had no legal
maximum, but appear to have had administrative norms or rules that kept nearly all payments
in line with other states’ legal maxima: in the analysis below, I use the 99th percentile payment
in a state in fiscal year 1938-39 as a measure of maximum payments.7 In those states with legal
maximum payments, these 99th percentile payments were almost always the same as the legal
maxima. Finally, three states specified in addition that the sum of income and OAA payments had
to reach some minimum amount: this essentially set a common dollar value of “needs” across all
people.
7

The 99th percentile payment is based on summary tables on the distribution of grants to new recipients by state,
from U.S. Social Security Board (1939b). The distribution of payments is reported in 5-dollar bins, so I identify the
bin containing the 99th percentile payment and use the smaller value of the upper endpoint of the bin or, when it
exists, the state’s legal maximum payment.

The effect of local funding on OAA payments and recipiency

3.1

Data and empirical specification

Since local governments played some role in the granting of old-age assistance in nearly all states,
one would expect that when the cost of additional spending was lower for local governments, the
overall level of spending would be higher. Two difficulties arise in an empirical analysis of the
degree to which this was true. First, local funding shares may be correlated with population
characteristics, including the level of need – if, for example, states with worse local labor market
conditions were more likely to shift funding to the state level. Second, local funding shares may be
correlated with other aspects of state OAA policies that may themselves have influenced the level
of OAA relief provided, separately from the local funding share.
To address the first challenge, the main specifications restrict comparisons to counties on either
side of a state border. The spirit of this approach is to make comparisons of areas that follow
different policies, but that are similar in terms of underlying need or other characteristics that may
lead to greater levels of OAA for a given state policy. This strategy follows Fetter and Lockwood
(2016), who show that across states, OAA generosity in 1939 was correlated with underlying trends
in labor force participation, but that there is no evidence of differential underlying trends in labor
force participation once comparisons are limited to counties on either side of a state border.
Limiting comparisons to state borders does not address the second challenge, however, which
is that other aspects of OAA policies beyond local funding shares may also change discontinuously
at state borders and may be correlated with local funding shares. To address this second concern,
I test the robustness of my estimates to the inclusion of other observable aspects of state OAA
policies. My findings on the effects of local funding shares are robust to inclusion of additional
policy variables, and in fact are somewhat stronger when these controls are included. Provided
that these additional OAA policy variables are representative of the overall set of both observable
and unobservable features of OAA policy, this result strengthens the case that the results are not
due to unobserved state-level policies.
It is important to note that to the extent that states that intended to provide lower OAA

10

payments did so in part by setting high local funding shares, it does not necessarily change the
interpretation of the estimated relationship, which is still the effect of allocating greater fiscal
responsibility to localities. What would be a concern is if states set not only local funding shares,
but instead multiple features of OAA, to reduce OAA payments, and if these other features were
not appropriately controlled for in the regression. Hence assessing robustness to controlling for
other features of OAA is an important part of the identification strategy.
To address the additional concern that state policies other than OAA-related policies could also
indirectly influence OAA recipiency or payments, I also show that further controls for other aspects
of state policy or political preferences, such as limitations on the ability of state governments to
take on debt, do not substantively affect the results. Finally, I also present estimates from a panel
specification that controls flexibly for any variation in county characteristics or state policy that
was constant over the time period of the panel (from 1937 to 1939). This panel specification yields
nearly identical results.
The main specifications use county-level data on three measures of payments and recipiency
under OAA programs: total OAA payments per person 65 and above, OAA recipients as a share
of the population 65 and above, and OAA payments per recipient. The number of recipients and
total OAA payments are measured in December 1939, and come from U.S. Social Security Board
(1940d). These measures are normalized using the population 65 and above measured in the 1940
Census.8 A handful of states made some grants jointly to couples and reported the couple as a
single recipient; I adjust for joint recipiency using information from U.S. Social Security Board
(1941) on the share of recipients with joint grants.9
The estimating equation for the main empirical specifications is
ycb = αb + β(Local funding share)c + Λ0 Xc + εcb .

(1)

8
Three states had an eligibility age of of 70 in 1939. I normalize these using the 65 and above population, and
include a control for having the higher eligibility age.
9
In particular, this publication reports the share of new recipients in fiscal year 1939-40 in each state who were
married and the share of these individuals who received a joint grant. I calculate the share who received joint grants
and inflate the number of recipients for each county by the corresponding state’s share receiving joint grants. This
adjustment makes little difference in the main results and does not qualitatively change any results in the paper, but
does affect the magnitude of the results in Section 3.3 that combine 1937 data with the 1939 data.

11

Because some counties lie on more than one state border, the unit of observation is a county-state
border-pair; c indexes counties and b indexes state border groups (where a border group for a pair
of bordering states comprises all counties that touch the border). Here αb is a fixed effect for each
border group, β is the coefficient of interest, and Xc is a vector of controls for other characteristics
of OAA policy and/or population characteristics.10 The OAA policy controls include the 99th
percentile monthly payment as a measure of maximum payments, as well as a set of indicator
variables for the other aspects of OAA policies described in Section 2.2. Because local funding
shares vary at the state level, standard errors are clustered by state.
In interpreting the results it is important to note that the estimated relationship is between the
level of OAA provided and the statutory local funding share, rather than a realized local funding
share (although the difference between the two, as noted in Section 2, was generally quite small).
Using the latter could be problematic in that decisions regarding payments could, in principle,
influence the share of payments funded by local governments. However, the statutory local funding
share is not directly influenced by local decisions, avoiding problems of reverse causality.

3.2

Main results

Estimates of equation (1) provide evidence that county funding was a significant limiting factor on
the size of the OAA program. Table 1 reports estimates of equation (1) with the county recipiency
rate as the dependent variable. Column (1) reports a simple regression in the full sample of
counties, with no border-pair fixed effects. This unconditional comparison indicates that a greater
local funding share was associated with a significantly lower recipiency rate. Column (2) limits
the sample to counties on state borders, and column (3) restricts comparisons to counties across
the same state border. The first key result in Table 1 is that the negative relationship in the
unconditional comparison is also present in the comparisons that condition on state border fixed
effects, suggesting that the relationship between local funding shares and county recipiency rates
is not driven by a correlation between population characteristics and county funding shares. The
10
In principle, comparisons can be restricted still further by limiting comparisons only to adjacent counties (as
opposed to comparing all counties on either side of a state border). In practice, restricting comparisons to adjacent
counties leads for the most part to very similar but less precisely estimated coefficients. I focus on the state border
comparisons but present selected county-pair results in the appendix.

12

second key result in Table 1 is that the magnitude of the relationship between local funding shares
and county recipiency rates actually increases when controls for other observable characteristics of
state OAA policy are included in the regression. The estimate in column (4), which I regard as the
preferred specification since it holds other features of state OAA laws constant, indicates that a 10
percentage point greater county funding share is associated with roughly a 4 percentage point lower
recipiency rate, a substantial decrease compared to the overall mean of about 22 percent. Finally,
the specification in column (5) includes as covariates a range of other county-level characteristics
that could either influence the level of need or capacity to provide relief. It is encouraging that the
inclusion of these controls leads to very little change in the key coefficient estimates.11
Although not the focus of this analysis, the coefficients on the other policies for the most part
have reasonable signs. Higher maximum payments are associated with higher recipiency, likely reflecting either higher take-up or greater eligibility under more generous OAA plans. Older eligibility
ages and relatives’ responsibility requirements are negatively related to recipiency. The positive
(conditional) relationship of property limitations with recipiency is consistent with these limitations in fact serving to liberalize eligibility, as described in Section 2.2, but could perhaps reflect
greater formality of eligibility testing in states that are more generous in unobserved ways. In these
specifications there is little evidence that claims on recipients’ property, citizenship requirements,
or minimum amounts for the sum of income and benefits payments influenced recipiency.
The results in Table 2 suggest that greater local funding was also associated with lower payments
per person, although the coefficients are somewhat less stable across specifications and the implied
magnitudes are small relative to their means. The coefficient in column (4), conditioning on state
border effects and other features of OAA policies, suggests that local funding shares greater by 10
percentage points had, on average, 40-cent lower payments per recipient per month, relative to a
mean of approximately 19 dollars. This could reflect either that local governments chose to lower
recipiency rather than payments when required to fund a greater share of payments, or simply that
they had less influence over payments than they did over recipiency.
The coefficients on other OAA policies again have reasonable signs. Unsurprisingly, higher

maximum payments, or the presence of a true income floor, raised payments per recipient. States
with an eligibility age of 70 or citizenship requirements had significantly higher payments, possibly
reflecting different choices in a tradeoff between higher payments and higher recipiency. On the
other hand, property limitations, which were associated with higher recipiency, were also associated
with higher payments. While claims on recipients’ property as a condition of assistance were not
associated with higher recipiency, they were associated with higher payments, likely reflecting a
lower cost of providing assistance when a portion of relief payments could be recovered.
Taken together, the effects on recipiency and payments per person meant that greater county
funding shares led to significantly smaller OAA programs relative to the size of the elderly population. Table 3 reports estimates of equation (1) using payments per person 65 and above as a
summary measure incorporating both potential margins of adjustment. Across all specifications
that restrict comparisons to state boundaries there is a statistically significant negative relationship. The estimates in column (4), which control for other state policies, imply that 10 percentage
point greater local funding was associated with OAA payments per person lower by about 90 cents,
or about one-fifth of the mean of $4.09.
Figure 3 displays residual regression plots of OAA recipiency and payments against local funding
share, conditional on the controls in column (4) of Tables 1-3. Encouragingly, these graphs illustrate
that the estimated coefficients in Tables 1-3 reflect differences in OAA payments and recipiency
across the full spectrum of local funding shares, rather than being driven by outlier counties or
simply by a shift between having some local funding and no local funding.
In the Appendix, I present a range of results to address possible concerns. A first concern is that
making comparisons among all counties on either side of a state border does not adequately control
for the underlying level of need or other important, unobserved characteristics of counties. Table
A1 reports results for all three key outcomes that restrict comparisons only to adjacent counties.
The data are at the county by county-pair level, and the regressions include fixed effects for each
county pair. In these specifications, following Dube, Lester and Reich (2010), standard errors are
clustered by border group (the group of all counties along the same state border) as well as by
state, since the same county will appear in multiple pairs, with pairs overlapping along the state

14

border. Column (4) shows results comparable to the preferred specifications above, which are less
precise but very similar to those using the full state border for comparison.
Another possible concern is that the county population characteristics included in column (5) of
the tables above do not adequately represent the level of need. Appendix Table A2 reports results
with additional controls measuring economic conditions and levels of other forms of relief, but which
are available for only a subset of counties and which are potentially endogenous control variables as
they may have been affected by levels of OAA: registered unemployment in 1937 as a share of the
population from Haines (2010), WPA spending per capita from 1935-39 from Fishback, Kantor and
Wallis (2003), and log per capita retail sales in 1939 from Fishback, Horrace and Kantor (2005).
Inclusion of these controls leads to little change in the coefficient on the local funding share.12
Finally, it is also possible that state policies other than OAA were related to OAA payments or
recipiency rates and that these policies were correlated with local funding shares, but not adequately
controlled for by using other features of OAA programs. One potentially important factor is a
state’s ability to finance relief spending: as Lansdale et al. (1939) note, by the late 1930s OAA
had become a major share of overall state government expenditures in many states. Many states
required either a referendum or a constitutional amendment to incur debt, although some states
were able to circumvent these restrictions. I use the measure of state debt limitations defined by
Gruber and Hungerman (2007), who use this variation as an instrument for New Deal spending;
ultimately it is based on information reported in Shawe (1936). Another potentially important
factor is a state’s political preference towards public assistance, which may not be fully captured
through the observable features of its OAA law. Since some of the early social insurance legislation
was driven by the Progressive movement, as a rough measure of such preferences I use the share of
a state’s vote in the 1924 presidential election that went to the Progressive Party (from Carter et al.
(2006), Series Eb208-259). Finally, I include county-level religious membership in 1936 (normalized
by 1940 population), from Haines (2010), as an additional population control. Results including
these controls are presented in Table A3.13 Again, the estimated relationship between local funding
12

Alternatives, such as using changes in unemployment between 1937 and 1940, including FERA or Civil Works
Administration (CWA) spending, or using changes in log retail sales from 1935 to 1939 give very similar results.
13
They exclude the District of Columbia, which is not discussed in Shawe (1936).

15

and OAA recipiency is very similar to that in the preferred specification. Including these additional
controls leads to slightly larger coefficients on payment per recipient, although the magnitude
remains small relative to the mean.
Returning to the preferred specifications, some simple counterfactuals based on the estimated
coefficients imply that the shift away from local funding of relief was central to the growth of old-age
assistance in the New Deal. In 1934, immediately prior to the introduction of federal matching,
most old-age assistance programs – all but 7 of the 28 in place – required localities to fund at least
25 percent of payments, and all but 9 required localities to fund at least half (Cahn, 1934), with the
remainder funded by state governments. Table 4 uses the estimated coefficients from column (4)
of each of the preceding tables to predict changes in OAA recipiency, payments per recipient, and
payments per person 65 and above if all states in 1939 had shifted to no local funding, 25 percent
local funding, or 50 percent local funding, holding all else constant. A shift to 25 percent local
funding for all states would have led to a reduction in recipiency of roughly 6 percentage points,
off of a base of 22 percent, and a reduction in per-capita OAA payments of $1.34, off of a base of
$4.09. The coefficients suggest that had local funding of 50 percent been required, OAA payments
per person would have been roughly ten percent of its actual size, largely through reductions in
recipiency. It is worth noting that these counterfactuals hold the federal share constant at 50
percent, and hence reflect the effects of shifting the burden of the other half of payments between
local and state governments. It is not obvious how old-age assistance may have developed in the
absence of the federal matching provisions of the Social Security Act (or how state programs would
have developed as they matured). Despite these caveats, the results provide some indication that
the shift away from local funding was quantitatively quite significant.

3.3

Robustness: policy changes from 1937-1939

A potential threat to a causal interpretation of the estimates above is that states with unobserved
policies leading to higher recipiency may also have had lower local funding shares. Although the
fact that the relationship between local funding and OAA recipiency becomes stronger when conditioning on observable policy characteristics weighs against this interpretation, to provide further

16

support I estimate panel specifications that control flexibly for fixed characteristics of counties.
In particular, county-level data on OAA payments and recipients is available for December 1937
from U.S. Social Security Board (1938b), and information on state laws as of the same month is
compiled in U.S. Social Security Board (1938a). I construct a two-period panel of counties using
these sources. Observations of four states in 1937 are excluded from the sample: Tennessee did not
report county-level figures in 1937, Virginia had no OAA program in 1937, and Maine had virtually
no program – only 42 recipients total, for a recipiency rate below 0.1 percent. Washington had
an OAA program but no formal rule governing local funding shares. I use the 1940 population
65 and above to calculate recipiency rates and OAA payments per person in 1937, and adjust for
joint recipiency using the share of recipients receiving joint grants in fiscal year 1937-38 U.S. Social
Security Board (1939a). Of the states remaining in the sample, four changed local funding shares
between 1937 and 1939. One of these changes was modest – Oregon reduced the local funding
share from 25 percent to 20 percent – but the others were quite significant, with New Hampshire
reducing the local share from 45 percent to 25 percent, North Dakota from 25 percent to 7.5
percent, and Louisiana from 25 percent to zero percent. The small number of changes makes the
panel specification less natural as a baseline specification, but as we will see the resulting estimates
do provide support for my preferred interpretation of the main estimates.
Following the spirit of the main specifications, I limit comparisons to state borders and estimate
the following equation:
ycbt = αbt + γc + β(Local funding share)ct + Λ0 Xct + εcbt

(2)

where αbt is a state-border by year fixed effect, γc a county fixed effect, and β is estimated using
within-county variation in local funding shares over time. Table 5 reports estimates of equation
(2). Encouragingly, the coefficients are all very close in magnitude to the corresponding estimates
from Tables 1-3. Focusing on columns (2), (4), and (6), which control for changes in other policies
between 1937 and 1939, the coefficients suggest that a 10 percentage point increase in the local
funding share should lead to a 4.2 percentage point reduction in recipiency (compared to 4.1
percentage points in Table 1), a 47-cent reduction in payments per person (compared to 40 cents
17

in Table 2), and an 82-cent reduction in payments per person 65 and above (compared to 89 cents
in Table 3). The close similarity between the panel specification and the main, cross-sectional
comparisons support interpretation of the latter as the effect of local funding shares.

3.4

Heterogeneity by level of control

As emphasized in Section 2, in nearly all states both local and state governments had some influence
over decisions in OAA cases, but the division of authority between state and local governments
varied significantly, with local influence and local funding tending to be positively correlated. Although it would be difficult to measure this division exactly, one useful measure of the division of
authority is whether state or local officials made final decisions on individual cases. OAA should
be more sensitive to the locality’s marginal cost of funding additional OAA grants when localities
themselves make final decisions, and OAA may be unusually generous when localities make final
relief decisions without sharing in the cost (as they did in a handful of states). Testing for differences in the effect of local funding shares by the local government’s degree of control is interesting
in its own right, and to the extent that localities are more sensitive to the local cost of providing
OAA, it also helps to support the interpretation of the main specifications as being a causal effect
of increasing local funding shares.
The results suggest that recipiency declined with the local funding share even in those states
where state governments made the final relief decisions, but that when localities made the final
decision on a relief case, recipiency and payments were significantly more sensitive to local funding
shares. Table 6 reports specifications that document the relationship between the size of OAA
programs and local funding and decision making, where local funding is interacted with the mutually
exclusive categories of local and state-level final decisions. All specifications include border fixed
effects and columns (2), (4), and (6) control for the other policies included in Tables 1-3.
Focusing on specifications that control for other state policies, the results suggest that when
localities made final decisions, a 10 percentage-point greater local funding share was associated
with a 5.7 percentage point reduction in recipiency, an 86-cent reduction in payments per person,
and a reduction of $1.34 in payments per elderly person. By comparison, in states where state

18

governments made final relief decisions, estimated changes in recipiency and payments as a result
of greater local funding are more sensitive to inclusion of other policy controls, but always smaller
than in states where localities made final relief decisions. Specifications that control for other
policies suggest that a 10 percentage point greater local funding share was associated with a 2.3
percentage point reduction in payments, a 13-cent higher average payment (although not statistically significant), and a 36-cent reduction in payments per elderly person. In all specifications,
the coefficient on local funding shares is significantly different in the two types of states at the 10
percent level or lower. Finally, the coefficient on the indicator for final decisions resting at the local
level shows that when localities made final decisions and the local funding share was zero – as was
the case in a handful of states – recipiency and payments were substantially higher.14
To complement the counterfactuals shown in Table 4, Table 7 shows counterfactuals that allow
for both the level of local funding and the level of decision making to change. This may be the most
relevant set of counterfactuals for understanding the shift away from local funding, since decision
making moved from the local to the state level at the same time as funding did. The results lead
to even stronger conclusions than those shown in Table 4, suggesting that had localities funded 50
percent of relief grants and made final relief decisions, only 1 percent of the elderly would have
received OAA.

Effects on composition of relief

4.1

Measuring differences in OAA receipt using the 1940 Census

Having documented evidence that local funding reduced OAA recipiency, a natural extension is
to ask whether specific groups were disproportionately affected by the shift to state funding. A
particularly important dimension of this question is how the shift away from local provision of aid
affected racial disparities in access to old-age support. For example, Alesina and Glaeser (2004)
14

A caveat in interpreting these results is that the difference in slopes between the two types of states is not
statistically significant in a panel specification following equation (2), perhaps because it is difficult to pick up this
difference with only a small number of policy changes between 1937 and 1939. Interpreted at face value, the point
estimates from the panel specification suggest that recipiency responded similarly negatively to local funding shares
in both types of states.

19

document that welfare benefits have been less generous in states with higher minority population
shares, and Luttmer (2001) finds that support for welfare spending falls as the share of local
recipients from one’s own racial group falls. Given these findings, and the possibly greater salience
of the racial composition of local assistance recipients relative to state assistance recipients, it is
possible that the degree to which OAA payments were funded locally may have mattered for the
racial composition of relief recipients.
A basic difficulty in understanding how policies differentially affected OAA receipt of different
groups is that OAA receipt is unobserved in the 1940 Census, and no comprehensive data are
available at the county level on characteristics of OAA recipients in this period. The Census did,
however, ask whether an individual received more than $50 in non-wage income in 1939. Nonwage income includes various other forms of income in addition to OAA, but it is possible to
use differences across counties in nonwage income to proxy for differences in OAA receipt.15 In
particular, restricting comparisons to state borders controls flexibly for differences in baseline levels
of receipt of non-wage income that are spatially correlated. Conditioning on comparisons across
state borders, the analysis then tests whether greater local funding shares are associated with
differential over- or underrepresentation of blacks, relative to their share of the population. Note
that if, for example, blacks are underrepresented among OAA recipients relative to their share of
the elderly population but to a similar degree across states, this analysis will not find evidence that
local funding leads to greater underrepresentation.
As should be expected, county-level measures of non-wage income receipt for individuals 65 and
above are strongly correlated with actual OAA recipiency rates. Using complete-count Census data
from 1940 from Ruggles et al. (2015), Figure 4 plots, for each county, the share of the population
65 and above receiving non-wage income in 1939 against actual recipiency rates in December 1939.
In most counties the share of the population reporting non-wage income is higher than the share
receiving OAA, as would be expected, but the important result in the figure is that higher recipiency
15
The instructions to enumerators indicated that non-wage income included, among other things, income from
business profits or professional fees, income from roomers or boarders, cash relief payments, regular contributions
from family members not in the same household, in-kind income, and commodities consumed from the individual’s
own business. In part the approach I take here follows the spirit of Fetter and Lockwood (2016), which documents
that receipt of non-wage income increases discretely at age 65, and more so in states with larger OAA programs.

20

rates are strongly associated with higher shares of the population reporting non-wage income, and
hence that differences in receipt of non-wage income may provide a reasonable measure of differences
in recipiency rates across counties.
Table 8 reports regression results formalizing the relationship documented in Figure 4.16 The
first column reports a simple regression of the share of the county population receiving non-wage
income on the county recipiency rate and a constant term. The slope coefficient implies that a one
percentage point greater recipiency rate is associated with a 0.426 percentage point rise in the share
reporting non-wage income. This result continues to hold in the state-border design, as shown in
column (2): here a one percentage point rise in recipiency rates is associated with a share reporting
non-wage income that is greater by 0.354.

4.2

Effects of local funding by race

I apply the non-wage income data constructed and validated in Section 4.1 to investigate the
impact of local funding requirements on the composition of OAA recipients, and in particular
whether these requirements influenced the racial composition of recipients. I examine the share of
non-wage income recipients 65 and above who are black relative to the black share of the population
65 and above, to measure differential over- or underrepresentation of blacks in areas where localities
played a greater role in funding. Similar to the analysis in Section 3, the identifying assumption
is that in the absence of OAA policies that differentially affect representation of blacks among
OAA recipients, the difference between representation of blacks among those who receive non-wage
income and the representation of blacks in the overall population 65 and above would be constant
across state borders. Note that it is not a concern, for example, if whites were more likely than
blacks to own income-producing assets, so long as that relative likelihood was constant across state
borders.
The summary statistics reported in Table 9 indicate that in the United States as a whole, and
especially in the South, blacks were underrepresented among non-wage income recipients. In the
16
In a handful of relatively small counties, information on non-wage income is coded as missing for all individuals
65 and older, explaining the slightly smaller number of observations when non-wage income is used rather than county
recipiency rates.

21

average county with any blacks 65 and above, 50 percent of blacks had non-wage income; about 59
percent of whites did. In the South, about 45 percent of blacks in the average county, and about 55
percent of whites, had non-wage income. These differences in rates of receipt of non-wage income
translated into differences between the black share of the population receiving non-wage income
and the black share of the total population of about 0.011 in the country as a whole, and 0.025 in
the South.
The key question I wish to investigate is whether this underrepresentation was differentially
greater in states in which localities funded a greater share of OAA payments. This question is
addressed in Table 10, which reports regressions of the share of non-wage income recipients 65 and
above who are black on the local funding share, controlling for the share of the overall population 65
and above who are black, and restricting comparisons to counties on either side of a state border. In
the country as a whole, a 10 percentage point increase in the local funding share is associated with
a reduction in the share of blacks among non-wage income recipients of 0.17 percentage points. In
the South the reduction is considerably larger, at 0.6 percentage points; in the non-South, there is a
statistically significant but much smaller negative relationship. Controlling for other policies yields
estimates of slightly greater magnitude: the implied effects would be 0.24 percentage points in the
country as a whole, and 0.75 percentage points in the South. Compared to the means reported in
Table 9, the implied effects of local funding appear to be quantitatively significant: a reduction of
0.0075 is 30 percent of the mean “underrepresentation” of blacks among non-wage income recipients
in the South.
Several caveats should be noted about these results. First, the results for the South are more
sensitive to reasonable alternative specifications than are the main results of the paper (those
for the non-South remain small but statistically significant). Appendix Table A4 reports similar
specifications to those in Table 10, but restricting comparisons to pairs of adjacent counties rather
than allowing comparisons across full state borders. The point estimates are broadly similar but
are somewhat smaller in magnitude: a ten percentage point higher local funding share in the
South is associated with a reduction of 0.4 to 0.5 percentage points in the share of blacks among
non-wage income recipients rather than 0.6 to 0.75, and with controls the coefficient estimate is

22

not statistically significant at conventional levels. Moreover, controlling for state debt limitations
and political preferences by including the Gruber and Hungerman (2007) measure of state debt
constraints and the 1924 Progressive vote share as controls to the specification reported in column
(5) of Table 10 yields a coefficient for the South of 0.021 (with a standard error of 0.039) rather
than -0.075.
Finally, the fact that actual receipt of OAA is not observed further complicates the interpretation
of these estimates. At least two issues arise. The first is that given that a significant number of the
elderly received non-wage income other than OAA, the quantitative implications for OAA receipt
are difficult to assess even if these results provide an indication as to the existence and direction
of an effect. The second is that if whites were more likely than blacks to receive sources of nonwage income other than OAA, in principle any factor that reduces OAA recipiency, even if it does
not change the share of OAA recipients who are black, could reduce the share of non-wage income
recipients who are black. Without observing OAA receipt by race, this concern is difficult to address
directly. Yet the results weigh against such an interpretation, at least in the South. In particular,
maximum payments (as measured by 99th percentile payments) show a significant relationship
with overall recipiency in Table 1, and if the differences in the share of non-wage income recipients
who were black were explained by race-neutral reductions in OAA recipiency, it is likely that lower
maximum payments would also be associated with differential underrepresentation of blacks among
non-wage income recipients. However, in column (5) of Table 10, the maximum OAA payment is
not statistically significant at any conventional level, and its magnitude, relative to the coefficient
on the local funding share, is considerably lower than in the main results.
Given the data constraints, these results are necessarily speculative. Yet they may suggest
that when counties in the South bore more of the cost of funding relief, blacks were differentially
adversely affected.17 It may be, then, that the shift to state administration of old-age relief was
beneficial to blacks, even in the South.
17
It is worth noting that to the extent that local funding did differentially reduce OAA receipt among blacks, these
results have little to say on the mechanism behind this relationship. One possibility is that the relationship is driven
by OAA officials explicitly denying benefits to blacks who applied, but other factors may have been important as well
– for example, potential applicants may have responded to the expectation of discrimination by not applying.

Conclusion

A fundamental feature of relief in the New Deal was the shift away from local provision of transfer
payments to state and federal provision. Using variation in the division of OAA funding between
local and state governments, I find that the shift from local to state funding was critical for the
growth of old-age support in the New Deal. The regression estimates suggest that had localities
needed to fund half of old-age payments in 1939 – which was not uncommon as of 1934 – the OAA
recipiency rate would have been 5 percent rather than 22 percent, and perhaps even lower. More
speculatively, given the constraints imposed by data availability, there is some evidence that the
shift away from local provision of relief benefitted blacks, particularly in the South.
Although not investigated here, it is also possible that the shift from local to state decisionmaking reduced scope for corruption in public assistance. While the corruption of local relief
officials was proverbial before the New Deal, Wallis, Fishback and Kantor (2006) point out that by
the end of the 1930s relief was viewed as bureaucratic, but not corrupt. They argue that the federal
government did not gain from local corruption, and hence reduced corruption in the programs in
which it had greater control (such as the Works Progress Administration). But it may be something
of a puzzle that complaints of corruption fell for the assistance programs even though the federal
government had little power over their administration. It may be that, like the federal government,
state government officials also saw little benefit from local corruption, and hence reduced corruption
as they took on a greater role in relief spending. It may also be, as Troesken (2006) argues, that
any type of regime change may disrupt existing relationships and thereby be conducive to reducing
corruption.
