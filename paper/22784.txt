Log-linear Approximation versus an Exact Solution at the ZLB in the New Keynesian Model
Gauti B. Eggertsson and Sanjay R. Singh
NBER Working Paper No. 22784
October 2016
JEL No. E30,E50,E60
ABSTRACT
How accurate is a log-linear approximation of the New Keynesian model when the nominal
interest rate is bounded by zero? This paper compares the solution of the exact non-linear model
to the log-linear approximation. It finds that the difference is modest. This applies even for
extreme events in numerical experiments that replicate the U.S. Great Depression. The exact nonlinear model makes the same predictions as the log-linear approximation for key policy questions
such as the size and sign of government spending and tax multipliers. It also replicates well
known paradoxes like the paradox of toil and the paradox of price flexibility. The paper also
reconciles different findings reported in the literature using Calvo versus Rotemberg pricing.

Introduction

Short-term interest rate collapsed to zero in most of the advanced world following the crisis
of 2008, which limited central banks’ ability to stimulate spending. This shifted the focus of
policymakers and researchers to fiscal policy. Some striking results emerge from a class of New
Keynesian models, typically using the Calvo (1983) model of price frictions, see e.g. Eggertsson
(2011), Christiano, Eichenbaum and Rebelo (2011), and Woodford (2011).1 Once the zero bound
on the short term nominal interest rate (ZLB) is binding, and if the monetary authority cannot
commit to future monetary policy, the multiplier of government spending is always larger than
one and in some cases much larger than one. Another noteworthy result, see e.g. Eggertsson
(2010), is that supply side policies such as labor tax cuts are contractionary at the ZLB (also
known as the paradox of toil). While the former result appeared to resurrect old Keynesian
orthodoxy, the latter one goes against much of the conventional wisdom in macroeconomics.
There has been growing skepticism about the accuracy of these results in the economic profession. The work cited above relies on log-linear approximations of all equilibrium conditions except it explicitly keeps track of the constraint that the short term nominal interest rate is bounded
by zero.2 Braun, Körber and Waki (2016) report results from a non-linear calibration of a model
with quadratic pricing frictions (based on Rotemberg 1982). They find that government spending multipliers are small and orthodox at the ZLB, while the paradox of toil disappears. These
results are of great interest, since the Calvo and the Rotemberg model are equivalent in their
log-linear approximation. Fernández-Villaverde, Gordon, Guerrón-Quintana and Rubio-Ramirez
(2015) study the non-linear Calvo model and emphasize the importance of non-linear features
brought about due to the ZLB. A key contribution of their work is to consider richer structure for
uncertainty than the previous literature, which clarifies several important non-linear properties
implied by the ZLB that the previous literature did not capture. Miao and Ngo (2016) compare
the fully non-linear Calvo model with the Rotemberg pricing model under uncertainty and document that these two models behave very differently in a non-linear setting. Taken together, these
papers raise doubts about the accuracy of the existing literature that relies on log-linearizations,
about the effect of fiscal policy at the ZLB.
One difficulty in making an overall assessment about the accuracy of the log-linearization
in papers such as Eggertsson (2011), Christiano, Eichenbaum and Rebelo (2011), and Woodford
(2011) on the basis of the work cited above, is that it either uses a different form of uncertainty,
a different price mechanism (Calvo vs Rotemberg) or some combination of the two. This paper
1 The

first paper to formally study fiscal policy in the New Keynesian model subject to the ZLB is Eggertsson
(2001).
2 It is not important if the bound is exactly zero, or slightly positive or negative. The key is that there is a bound.

fills this gap.
The main finding of this paper is that the difference between solving the fully non-linear
model or using a log-linear approximation (but taking account of the non-linearity created by
the ZLB) is small in the numerical experiments. The exact non-linear Calvo model is solved and
compared to a log-linear approximation, using the same form of uncertainty as in Eggertsson
(2011), Christiano, Eichenbaum and Rebelo (2011), and Woodford (2011), i.e. a two state Markov
Process with an absorbing state. Moreover, exactly the same procedure is used to parameterize
the size of the shocks and parameters in the log-linear and non-linear settings.

The bottomline is summarized in Table 1 that considers two benchmark parameterizations.
One numerical experiment matches a recession of the order of the Great Recession (GR) (an
output gap of -10 percent and a two percent fall in inflation). The other experiment matches
a large contraction of the order of the Great Depression (GD) (30 percent output gap and a
10 percent drop in inflation). As the table reveals, there is little difference between the loglinear approximation of the model and the exact non-linear solution: the government spending
multiplier is above one in the GR scenario and above 2 in the GD scenario as in Eggertsson
(2011). In addition, the paradox of toil does not depend on the log-linear approximation, it
occurs in either setting.
Overall, the results suggest that the log-linear approximation is not driving the often cited
results of fiscal policy in New Keynesian model at the ZLB. The key non-linearity to keep track
of is the ZLB, while the remainder of the model appears to be well approximated with log-linear
approximation, at least under the assumption of a two state Markov process with an absorbing
state. This does not, however, imply that there are no important non-linearities created by richer
stochastic structure for the shocks at the ZLB, as documented by Fernández-Villaverde et al.
(2015).
The assumption that uncertainty is captured by a two state Markov process with an absorbing state implies that the model can be collapsed into only two equations (aggregate demand
and aggregate supply) in two unknowns (inflation and output). This makes the computation
of the equilibrium in the non-linear model simple. An important assumption that allows this
characterization is industry-specific labor markets as in Eggertsson and Woodford (2003). This

2

assumption eliminates price dispersion as a state variable.3 Fernández-Villaverde et al. (2015)
and Miao and Ngo (2016), however, assume a common labor market from which all firms must
hire, in which case price dispersion is a state variable of the non-linear model. Consequently
a simple two equation characterization of the form presented in this paper is not possible (see
Woodford (2003) for a general discussion of the importance of this assumption in New Keynesian
models).
Another important assumption maintained in this paper is that the fiscal policy intervention
is perfectly correlated with the shock that drives the economy to the ZLB, i.e. the fiscal stimulus
is in response to the recession. As emphasized in Eggertsson (2011), fiscal policy has a very
different effect if it follows a different stochastic process than the shock that drives the economy
to the ZLB. To take an extreme example, Eggertsson (2011) characterizes analytically when the
government increases spending permanently at the ZLB. In this case the fiscal multiplier changes
signs and becomes negative. Being explicit about the correlation of government spending with
the underlying ZLB shock process is an important consideration to reconcile results reported in
the literature that may sometime seem to conflict each other.
Finally, the main focus in this paper is the analysis of ZLB equilibrium that arises due to
real shocks that lead to the ZLB being binding. The paper does not analyze equilibria that arise
due to self-fulfilling expectations, but these type of equilibria can arise whether or not the model
is log-linearized. There is a rich literature exploring this topic, an important recent contribution
includes Christiano, Eichenbaum and Johannsen (2016).4 Christiano, Eichenbaum and Johannsen
(2016)’s results suggest that the equilibria that arise due to self-fulfilling expectations can plausibly be ruled out via stability-under-learning criteria.5
While the log-linearization approximates the non-linear model at the ZLB quite well, when
an equilibrium exists, the non-linear variation of the model also offers some additional insights
that are briefly commented on below where the organization of the paper is outlined, with more
details to follow.
Section 2 states the non-linear Calvo model. Section 2.1 clarifies the role of industry specific
labor markets. While the framework is standard, it is useful to clarify why price dispersion does
3 This

modeling assumption is relatively standard in the New Keynesian literature, see e.g. Woodford (2003) for
the textbook treatment. However, as stressed by Benigno and Woodford (2004), price dispersion is needed for welfare
analysis and hence will feature as a state variable in the analysis of optimal monetary policy.
4 Aruoba, Cuba-Borda and Schorfheide (2016), Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2001), Christiano and Eichenbaum (2012), Mertens and Ravn (2014), Nakata and Schmidt (2015) and Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2016), are some
examples of important contributions in this literature. We do show, however, that the non-linear model exhibits
multiple equilibria of a different form when the zero lower bound is binding, but we restrict attention to the locally
determinate equilibrium, which allows us to do comparative statics and address questions related to multipliers.
5 While their main focus is on ruling out multiplicity they also report numerical results on government spending
multipliers in a Calvo model with common factor market for labor. Their numerical experiments deliver similar
results across the linear and non-linear model. This suggests that the assumption of industry specific labor market,
while helpful for tractability, is not driving the results reported in this paper.

not appear in the definition of equilibrium. Section 2.2 summarizes the non-linear model by two
equations in two unknown, i.e. output and inflation, given fiscal policy and an exogenous shock
that follows a two state Markov process. This section shows that the non-linear model typically
has two solutions, the “regular ZLB” which is similar to the one analyzed in the log-linearized
models, and a hyper-deflation equilibrium. As already noted, the paper does not consider the
case in which the ZLB is binding due to self-fulfilling expectations, which represents a third
possibility. The hyper-deflation equilibrium appears less interesting than the “regular ZLB” as it
is shown not to pass standard equilibria selection criteria like local-determinacy and learnability,
in which case comparative statics are less meaningful.6 Accordingly the paper focuses on the
“regular” ZLB equilibria and leaves the study of indeterminate hyper-deflation equilibrium to
future work. Section 3 documents, in line with the literature that relies on log-linearization, that
the drop in output is increasing in the persistence of the shock. However, while at some critical
value the equilibrium in the log-linearized model “explodes” and then becomes indeterminate,
the analog in the non-linear model is a finite drop in output which is followed by non-existence of
equilibria. This gives a new rationale for the relative slope condition of the aggregate demand and
aggregate supply, discussed in Eggertsson (2011). Section 4 compares the quantitative predictions
of the log-linear approximation and the exact solution, i.e., what underlies Table 1 and explains
the way in which the model is parameterized. Finally, section 5 clarifies why the non-linear
Calvo model behaves so differently from the non-linear Rotemberg model documented in Braun,
Körber and Waki (2016) and Miao and Ngo (2016). The key reason is that in the Rotemberg
model, large deflation implies very large resource cost of price adjustment. The resource costs
of price changes become implausibly large very quickly (over 100% of GDP for 10% deflation)
suggesting that the model with Rotemberg price adjustment costs cannot generate the Great
Depression. Motivated by Rotemberg’s original article, this section concludes by suggesting an
alternative interpretation of these costs (as in Ascari and Rossi (2012)) so that these costs do not
show up directly in the resource constraint. The section documents that under this alternative
interpretation the Calvo and the Rotemberg model behave similarly at the ZLB.

6 When

an equilibrium is indeterminate in the model it means that there is an infinite number of bounded equilibria that solve the equations of the model in the vicinity of that equilibrium This means that comparative statics
are not meaningful absent further assumptions, for it becomes arbitrary which equilibria to select in response to an
exogenous disturbance.

This section briefly outlines the textbook (Woodford, 2003) New Keynesian model highlighting
the relevance of industry specific market for wages. It concludes with a proposition summarizing
that the model does not have any endogenous state variable, provided that monetary policy is
purely forward looking. The representative household maximizes

where wt (i ) is the nominal wage rate in the ith industry in the economy, Zt (i ) is the nominal

Every good i is produced by a monopolistically competitive firm. The production function of

the firm is assumed to be linear in industry-specific-labor:
yt (i ) = nt (i )
All production is consumed, so that Ct = Yt , and each firm faces the demand function for its
production given by yt (i ) = Yt (

pt (i ) − θ
Pt ) .

The key assumption in Woodford (2003) is that the labor employed by each monopolistically
competitive firm corresponds to a particular type of the labor variety supplied by the households.
The firm takes this wage rate as given. The firm’s period profit function is then given by

Woodford (2003) suggests that wtI should be interpreted as an industry specific wage for good

Using the Calvo (1983) price-setting assumption, a fraction 0 < α < 1 of good prices remain
unchanged in any period. With probability 1 − α, a firm is selected at random (independent of
the time of last adjustment) to adjust its good’s price. Let p∗t be the optimal reset price in period
t. A supplier that changes its price in period t chooses its new price pt (i ) to maximize present
discounted value of its profits, taking as given the industry level wage wtI which is expressed in

8 As noted by Woodford (2003), even if industry-specific labor markets are assumed, this need not imply that firms
have monopsony power. Instead it can be assumed that each firm is a wage-taker as noted above. See page 148 in
chapter 3 in Woodford (2003) for an elaboration on this point but where a more general notation is also developed to
make this point clear: In short, assume a double continuum of differentiated goods, indexed by ( I, j), with an elasticity
of substitution of θ between any two goods. Then all goods with the same index I (goods in the same "industry")
are assumed to change their prices at the same time, all using the same type I labor. Gertler and Leahy (2008) use
a similar structure to this double continuum, except they allow for idiosyncratic risk across firms within an ’island’
(industry).

To summarize:
Proposition 1. In a representative agent New Keynesian economy with industry-specific labor markets
7

and Calvo price setting, an equilibrium is defined as a collection of stochastic processes for {Ct , Yt , Πt , Kt , Ft
} that solve eqns {1 - 5} given a path for {Gt , τtw } determined by fiscal policy, a path for {it } determined by
monetary policy and a path for {ξ t }. Price dispersion defined by eqn 6 does not feature as a state variable
and is redundant in the determination of the equilibrium as long as it does not enter the governments’
policy choices.
The reason price dispersion does not enter the determination of the endogenous variables
is pointed out in Woodford (2003). The benchmark New Keynesian model assumes industryspecific labor markets so that the real marginal cost of supplying a given good depends only
on yt (i ) and aggregate output Yt . Alternatively in a model in which each firm hires from an
economy-wide labor markets, then the real marginal cost instead depends also on an alternaR1
tive measure of aggregate output Xt = 0 yt (i )di which in turn depends upon price dispersion
(Yun, 1996).9 Using industry-specific labor markets instead of economy-wide factor markets has
important implications for real rigidities in the economy as stressed in Woodford (2003). It also
allows for the analysis of the model without price dispersion as a state variable, as long as the
government policy does not depend on price dispersion. For welfare evaluation, however, price
dispersion is relevant, for it enters social welfare. Accordingly, optimal monetary policy will in
general take price dispersion into account (see Benigno and Woodford 2004). In this paper, however, policy will be characterized by a strict inflation target without reference to any endogenous
state variable, as in Eggertsson and Woodford (2003).

2.2

Two state Markov Chain, the ZLB and AS and AD equations

Closed form solutions for ‘Aggregate Supply’ and ‘Aggregate Demand’ can now be derived
under the assumption that the exogenous variable can only take on two values. ξ t is a two-state
Markov chain with an absorbing state. The long run , as in Eggertsson (2011), is when the shocks
are at the non-stochastic steady state. The long run is an absorbing state. The short run, in
contrast, is defined by period t ≥ 0 at which time the shock ξ S takes on a value below its steady
state value ξ L. It is assumed that in each period t < T e when ξ t = ξ S there is a constant probability

(1 − µ) that the shock reverts to its long run steady state value. T e < ∞ is the stochastic (but
finite) time period when the shock is back at the steady state level. So t ≥ T e is defined as the
long run.
The central bank sets an inflation target Πt = 1 whenever it can. If this inflation target
implies negative nominal interest rate, then the central bank sets it = 0 in which case Πt is
9 Compare

the intra-temporal condition of the household in the model with industry-specific labor markets with
t
the economy-wide labor markets. W
Pt depends on Nt in the economy wide labor markets model, and this aggregate
depends on the price dispersion. On the other hand, the factor-market-specificity assumption makes the real wage
independent of this aggregate.

endogenously determined. The analysis only considers the case in which the ZLB is binding
due to fundamental shocks but does not consider the possibility that the ZLB is binding due to
self-fulfilling expectations. Government spending and/or labor taxes can take on any values GS
and τSw in the short run but return back to steady state in the long run given by GL and τLw . There
is perfect correlation of the fiscal policy intervention and ξ t .

10

The system of equations can be simplified into two equations that determine inflation and
output in the short run. Units are chosen so that in the steady state, i.e the long run, YL = ξ L = 1,
−1

implying that λ = ( θ −θ 1 )(1 − GL )−σ̃ (1 − τLw ). Furthermore, given equations (1)-(5) in the long
run Π L = YL = 1, 1 + i L = β−1 , CL = 1 − GL and
1

K L = FL =

(1 − τLw )(1 − GL )− σ̃
1 − αβ

(7)

This allows for an explicit characterization of inflation and output in the short-run.
What makes the model particularly tractable is 1) that it is purely forward looking, and 2) the
assumption of an absorbing steady state. This implies that (1)-(5) can be combined into an AS
and an AD curve that determine ΠS and YS . It is assumed that the shock ξ S is large enough so
that the zero bound is binding, i.e., the solution ΠS = 1 implies negative nominal interest rate.
Accordingly, iS = 0.

just equations in one variable (Output). Find the values of Output that satisfy these equations at the grid points. It
is straightforward for the AD equation. The AS equation is non-linear and so a non-linear optimization routine in
Matlab ’fzero’ is used to find the values of Output that satisfy the AS equation (starting from some initial value). A
Web Appendix on the authors website provides more details on this algorithm and its robustness. In experiment there
has always been found only one positive real value for Y that satisfies the AS equation for a given Π.

Output drop

a Great Depression scenario of 30% drop in output and 10% drop in inflation where the two
curves intersect. The parametrization is further discussed in section 4.
The red (solid) line is the Aggregate Demand curve (8) for the case when the zero lower
bound is binding. The dashed blue line is the Aggregate Supply curve (or the New Keynesian
Phillips Curve) given by (9). There curves have two intersections. Moving from right to left, they
are termed the First and the Second Equilibrium respectively.
The first equilibrium corresponds to a 30% output drop and 10% deflation. The second
equilibrium, is a hyperdeflation equilibrium that generates 30% drop in prices per annum and
over 80% drop in output. The first equilibrium is very similar to, and exhibits properties of the
log-linear approximate equilibrium studied in the literature, such as Eggertsson and Woodford
(2003). It is locally unique and determinate. The second equilibrium, however, is locally indeterminate. This means that for small perturbation there are infinitely many solutions that satisfy
the equilibrium conditions. Moreover, it can be shown that indeterminate equilibrium is also
not learnable/E-stable.12 Accordingly, the next subsection focuses on the determinate equilibria,
leaving the analysis of second equilibrium to future work as its economic interpretation is less
clear.

As shown in Figure 2, the AS and AD curves are “almost linear” up to the stable equi-

librium. The next section compares the solution obtained of the non-linear model to the solution
from the log-linear approximation. It shows that the key qualitative prediction of the theory

Output drops at the ZLB in the non-linear and the linear model

A key prediction of the log-linearized New Keynesian model is that for small shocks, there can
be a large drop in output and inflation. This occurs due to a bifurcation. A natural first question
is if this is an artifact of the log-linearization. This section confirms this phenomenon in the
nonlinear model. As shown in Eggertsson (2011), the log-linearized model under the assumption
of a two state Markov chain with an absorbing state can be expressed as:
1. Aggregate Demand

approximation are parameterized to generate a 30% drop in output and 10% drop in inflation at
the intersection of the curves. The method used to parameterize the model is discussed further
in Section 4, this section outlines features of the solution that do not rely on the particular
parameterization, even if tying the model down with numbers is useful for illustration.
Let us first consider the log-linear approximation. Proposition 3 in Eggertsson (2011) establishes that the condition for local determinacy in the log-linear approximation of the model at
the ZLB is
L(µ) ≡ (1 − µ)(1 − µβ) − κµσ > 0

(C2)

which says that the AD curve needs to be steeper than the AS curve. This will always be the
case for a small enough µ, i.e. if the probability of going back to “long run” is large enough.
As the probability of staying in the depressed state increases, the two curves become close to
parallel and the drop in output and inflation goes to -∞. The log-linear approximation of the
model exhibits an explosion at a critical value µ̄ at which point no solution exists (the lines are
parallel). This is called the bifurcation point. When µ > µ̄ there is indeterminacy in the loglinearized model. This explosive behavior is at the heart of the model. It explains how “small”
shocks can trigger large drops in output.
The right hand side panel of figure 4 shows an example of the comparative static as µ is
increased in the log-linear approximation of the model. This leads to larger output drop and
larger deflation. The right hand side panel of figure 5 shows the exact bifurcation point in the
log-linear approximation. The second and third rows of the right hand side of of figure 6 shows
how output and inflation behave as a function of µ. Output and prices drop without a bound as
µ increases converging to −∞ at the bifurcation point, which is not shown in the figure.
Let us now move to the exact non-linear model. Is this bifurcation only an artifact of the
12

log-linearization? Recall that from figure 1 we are considering comparative statics of the first
equilibrium, which is well behaved and determinate. In this equilibrium the relative slope of AD
and AS are the same in the non-linear solution and the log-linear approximation as shown in
3. Figure 4 shows the effect of increasing the persistence of the shock in the non-linear model
(left hand side) similarly leads to a larger recession in the non-linear model. The key difference
between the non-linear and the log-linear approximation is show in figure 5. The bifurcation
point occurs in the log-linear model (see right hand panel) when the linear AD and AS curves
are paralell at µ̄. When µ > µ̄ then the relative slope of the two lines is reversed, and the model
is indeterminate. Meanwhile, we see that in the non-linear model there is also a critical value for
two curves when they are tangent to each other as shown in the left hand side panel of figure 5.
However, output and inflation do not explode at the bifurcation point. Instead, as seen in figure
6, bifurcation occurs at 1 − µ = 0.096 where deflation is 18% and the output drop is 51%. As can
be seen in figure 5 this happens as the two curves no longer intersect, i.e. the AS curve is convex
and is tangent to the AD curve, at finite values of output and inflation.
An interesting implication of this solution is that a marginal increase in µ beyond the bifurcation point implies that the non-linear model has no solution. Hence the indeterminacy region in
the log-linearized model does not seem to be of much practical interest; in the non-linear counterpart the comparable region of the parameter space corresponds to non-existence of equilibria.
The bound C2 on µ is, however, different for the nonlinear model. It is implicitly a condition requiring µ to be small enough so that two curves AD and AS are not tangent to each other. If that
condition fails to be satisfied there is non-existence rather than indeterminacy. The remainder of
the paper focuses on the case in which the model is away from the bifurcation point, so that an
equilibrium exists, and analyzes the determinate equilibria in the non-linear model.

Multipliers and paradoxes in numerical experiments

This section first describes the parameterization in more detail for the two scenarios discussed in
the introduction, then moves to analyze tax and spending multipliers.
The Great Depression scenario is defined as an event in which output drops by 30% and
inflation (annual) by 10%. The Great Recession is defined as a less extreme event with 10%
drop in output and 2% drop in inflation. The parameters and shocks are chosen to maximize
the posterior distribution of the model for both the linear and non-linear model. The priors are
discussed and method for parameterization is discussed in detail in Denes and Eggertsson (2009)
and are reproduced in the Appendix. The key focus of that Denes and Eggertsson (2009) is the
sensitivity of the conclusions drawn to the choice of priors, while this paper’s focus is on whether
it matters if the exact or the log-linear approximation is used. The mode of the posterior of the
model is reported in Table 2 for the exact model and the log-linear approximation. Observe from
Table 2 that the exact choice of parameters and shocks needed to generate the GD and GR will
depend on whether the parameterized is based on the exact non-linear model or its log-linear
approximation. This, of course, should not be surprising. The interesting question is if, given the
procedure for choosing the parameters, it matters if one uses the exact model vs. its log-linear
approximation. Does this choice have any effect on the economic inference one draws once these
two equilibrium characterizations have been used to replicate numerically a specific economic
scenario (GR or GD). That is the focus of the remainder of this section.14
14 This paper only reports the mode of the posterior. It is computed using a Matlab maximization routine developed
by Christopher Sims. All codes used to construct the model and the figures in this paper are available on the authors’
websites. The entire posterior distribution is not reported in this paper but this is done in Denes and Eggertsson
(2009) for the log-linearized model using a Metropolis algorithm. The calibrated parameters for the linear model are
the same as reported in Eggertsson (2011)

Rows 3 and 4 of Table 2 show the multipliers of government spending and labor tax cuts
in the linear and the non-linear models at zero interest rate for the two numerical experiments.
In the GD scenario the multiplier is 2.38 in the non-linear model, and 2.22 in the log-linear
approximation. The tax-increase multiplier is 0.71 vs 0.99. Hence both the large value of the
government spending multiplier at the ZLB and the positive effects of tax increases at the ZLB
(the paradox of toil) are maintained in the non-linear model. All the multipliers are smaller in
the GR scenario, but the differences between the linear and non-linear model are of the same
order. Figure 7 shows the comparative static of increasing government spending in the linear
15

and non-linear model. Qualitatively the effects are the same, since the relative slopes of the two
curves are the same, albeit the exact numbers differ. Even quantitatively, the effect of sizable
government spending increases shown in figure 7 are not very different across the two models.15
Comparative statics for labor tax cut are shown in figure 8, confirming the paradox of toil.16

It is instructive to look at the behavior of the multiplier across the two models. The key
economic insight of the literature that relied on log-linear approximation was that as the output
drop becomes bigger, the government spending multiplier becomes larger. This phenomenon is
shown in figure 6. In both models, as the probability of the staying at the zero bound increases,
the drop in output intensifies. In the linearized model this means that the multiplier of govern15 In

the figure below, government spending is temporarily increased in both models from 20 percent of steady
state output to 30 percent of steady state output

percent of GDP.

ment spending goes to ∞ as the drop in output goes to -∞. In the non-linear model, however,
bifurcation occurs at a finite level of output drop. At that point the multiplier of government
spending is very large or about 40.

Figure 9 compares the two models for an increase in price flexibility. Only the AS curve is affected by change in price flexibility parameter. As prices become more flexible, more firms adjust
them downward in response to a liquidity trap shock and hence more severe is the downturn.
This perverse effect has been extensively explored in Eggertsson (2011) and Christiano, Eichenbaum and Rebelo (2011) among others and is confirmed in the non-linear model. This paradox is
discussed in Bhattarai, Eggertsson and Schoenle (2014) in a more general setting away from the
ZLB in an estimated DSGE model.

Comparison to Rotemberg pricing

Another prominently used price setting assumption is quadratic is due to Rotemberg (1982). The
intermediate firms make the decision to change prices by incorporating the following cost of
adjusting prices into their profit function:

to the Calvo price adjustment probability in the following way:

(1 − α)(1 − αβ)

Following the same algebra as in the case of Calvo model, the following system of equations
for the Rotemberg model can be derived under the same assumption about uncertainty and

to the log-linear approximation assuming the following parameters. The log-linear Rotemberg
model and the log-linear Calvo model are identical. Accordingly the the same parameterization
is used for the log-linear Rotemberg model as in Table 2, using equation 10 to back out the
relevant parameters for the log-linearized Rotemberg model. As figure shows this results in the
same solution for the log-linear model as before, consistent with 30 percent drop in inflation and
10 percent drop in inflation. The non-linear Rotemberg model, however, cannot generate the GD.
To illustrate why this is the case, the same parameterization is fed into the non-linear model and
shown in the graph. From the figure, it is evident, that a fundamental divergence occurs between
the linear and non-linear model.
As the figure reveals, the nonlinear Rotemberg model behaves in a fundamentally different
way to the log-linear approximation. While the log-linear model generates a GD scenario, the
non-linear Rotemberg model show a different equilibrium altogether. The two curves intersect
at inflation drop of 2.70% and output drop of 4.95%. More importantly, however, the AD curve
has hanged its slope. If inflation goes below approximately −1% then aggregate demand is
now increasing with higher deflation, i.e., the larger the fall in the prices, the more output is
demanded in the aggregate. This is in contrast to the non-linear and the log-linear approximation
of the Calvo model discussed so far, as well as different from the log-linear approximation of the
Rotemberg model.
Is this behavior of the non-linear Rotemberg model economically meaningful? Figure 11
sheds some light on this. It shows that as inflation goes down, more of the economy’s resources
go into changing prices. For example, a 10% deflation as observed during the Great Depression
would require over 100% of the output of the economy to change prices. Clearly then, by as19

sumption, the Rotemberg model parameterized with physical resource costs of this kind cannot
generate a Great Depression, a result also reported in Braun, Körber and Waki (2016). More
generally, the large implied resource costs of changing prices is key to understanding why the
AD curve changes its slope. To understand this, it is useful to write out the aggregate resource
constraint
YS = CS + GS + YS

αr
( Π S − 1)2
2

The source of aggregate spending, YS , is private consumption, government consumption and
resources spent to change prices. This is the last term in the equation above. In the conventional
analysis, demand goes down at the ZLB because a reduction in inflation (dis-inflation) increases
the real interest rate. This reduces private consumption, CS , and thus aggregate demand YS . In
this model, however, there is one additional force. As deflation is reduced, each firm “demands”
more output to change prices. At relatively low values of inflation, this force dominates, which
makes aggregate demand slope downwards. Figure 10 shows that this happens at about −1%
inflation. This effect is absent in the non-linear Calvo model. In fact, AD is almost linear in
inflation. Hence the major difference in the results between the two models is the implication
that the large resource costs of price adjustment have on aggregate demand. The AS curve also
changes slope in the Rotemberg model with high enough deflation, i.e. output increases as
inflation goes down. The reason is once again the high resource costs of changing prices. As
inflation goes into negative territory, more resources go into changing prices. This reduces the
consumption of the representative agent, thus increasing his marginal utility of income. This, in
turn, will increase his labor supply, and increase aggregate supply.
The large resource costs of price changes rely heavily on the quadratic form of price adjustment and the fact that the value of αr is very large. It seem implausible that at moderate levels
of inflation, the actual output needed to change prices increases quadratically, corresponding to
over 100% of all output at deflation levels in single digits. Indeed, since the costs are quadratic,
then inflation of about −10% is not technically feasible in the numerical experiment reported
above as it would overwhelm the workforce. Since this particular mechanism is driving most of
the non-linearities in the Rotemberg model it does not seem to be a good price-setting assumption
to study extreme events of this form.17
There is, however, a simple modification of the Rotemberg model in which case the results
from this model are similar to the Calvo model. Rotemberg’s (1982) preferred interpretation of
the quadratic costs faced by firms was not physical menu costs, but instead that “... there is a
cost that captures the negative effect of price changes, particularly price increases on the reputation of
firms". An alternative interpretation of the Rotemberg model is thus simply that these are costs

Figure 12 compares the non-linear (‘Modified Rotemberg’) model to the linearized model. The
Modified Rotemberg model is parameterized to match the GD scenario.18 As the figure shows,
the non-linear model has no difficulty replicating this scenario, and the qualitative features of the
model are now more in line with the non-linear and log-linearized Calvo model.

Ascari and Rossi (2012) have already suggested this mathematical variation of the Rotemberg
model. In their model, while there are resource costs of changing prices borne by firms, these
costs are rebated to the household lump sum. Accordingly, the costs do not show up in the
economy’s resource constraint. A complementary approach would be to abandon the somewhat
unattractive assumption of quadratic costs of price adjustment, following the business cycle literature on investment adjustment costs. It has been recognized in the business cycle literature
that quadratic costs of investment adjustment can lead to non-sensical conclusions for the same
reason as here, large enough drop in investment lead to implausible adjustment costs. Christiano and Davis (2006, p. 13-14) resolve this by fitting a tenth degree polynomial, with standard

Rotemberg model and contrast them with those of the Linearized model.

Chebyshev interpolation that replicates the first order investment dynamics needed to explain
the business cycle and implied by a quadratic adjustment function – yet at the same time implies
plausible equilibrium resource adjustment costs. The same approach can be used here, but this
is left for future research.19
Hence, the assumption of quadratic costs implies that the non-linear model yields solutions
that are not be economically meaningful under extreme scenarios.

Conclusion

This paper studies the non-linear properties of the Calvo model at the ZLB. It also illustrates why
the Rotemberg model delivers different results and argues that the economics behind what is
driving those differences makes the Rotemberg model unattractive for analyzing extreme events.
A modified Rotemberg model – arguably more in spirit with Rotemberg’s original suggestion –
delivers very similar result as the Calvo model and the linearized model.

these authors point out the assumption of the adjustment function being quadratic is arbitrary, and has
usually been only made for simplicity in the context of non-linear models that are ultimately approximated by loglinear approximation. Taken literally, the non-linear counterpart then implies non-sensical investment adjustment
costs.

having substituted in the resource constraint and assuming that GtS+1 = GtS = G S . Observe
that the expectation of each variable conditional on that the shock will remain in the low "shortrun" state in the next period is denoted by ES . Writing the system in this way, this represents
a regular rational expectation system that can be solved via standard methods, e.g. using Blanchard and Kahn (1980).

where small letters { ŶtS , πtS , K̂tS , F̂tS } indicate deviations of the variables from the solution around
which the equations are linearized. This system of equations is determinate if there are at least
3 unstable eigenvalues outside of the unit circle. Numerically simulations (using reds and solds)
suggest that the second equilibrium fails to meet the determinacy conditions and hence is locally
unstable. Henceforth, the paper only investigates the properties of the stable equilibrium (in this
case, it is the one that produces 30% drop in Output and 10% drop in inflation ).

Priors used for likelihood estimation

The same priors are used across all likelihood maximization procedures. These were first used
by Denes and Eggertsson (2009) and the consequent literature. Table 3 reproduces them.

Multipliers in the Rotemberg Model

Table 4 reports the multipliers in the Rotemberg model and compares them with those obtained
in the Modified Rotemberg model. Notes below the table explain in detail the parametrization
used. The core point is that if there is physical resource costs of changing prices (e.g. menu
costs) that take on a quadratic form, then the non-linear model is unable to produce a significant
drop in output and inflation.

α reported here is the Calvo parameter : 1 - probability of price adjustment. We estimate this α in our likelihood maximization in order to use the same priors across all the specifications. It is straightforward to back out the Rotemberg αr using the formula reported
in the main text.
