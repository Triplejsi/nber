The Compositional Effect of Rigorous Teacher Evaluation on Workforce Quality

JEL No. H75,I28,J45
ABSTRACT
Improving public sector workforce quality is challenging in sectors such as education where
worker productivity is difficult to assess and manager incentives are muted by political and
bureaucratic constraints. In this paper, we study how providing improved information to
principals about teacher effectiveness and encouraging them to use the information in personnel
decisions affects the composition of teacher turnovers. Our setting is the Houston Independent
School District, which recently implemented a rigorous teacher evaluation system. Prior to the
new system, teacher effectiveness was negatively correlated with district exit and we show that
the policy significantly strengthened this relationship, primarily by increasing the relative
likelihood of exit for teachers in the bottom quintile of the quality distribution. Low-performing
teachers working in low-achieving schools were especially likely to leave. However, despite the
success, the implied change to the quality of the workforce overall is too small to have a
detectable impact on student achievement.

1. Introduction
Government agencies that provide services, such as education and health, are settings
where it is difficult to observe both inputs and outputs. These are also sectors where there are
ongoing concerns about efficiency and equity. In elementary and secondary education, efforts to
improve the effectiveness of schools have ranged from increases in resources via school finance
reforms, to increased competition via school choice, to performance standards via school
accountability. The success of any of these depends on the quality and commitment of the
workforce.
Recent research provides powerful evidence confirming that high-quality teachers are of
great value to students (Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff, 2014a/b; Hanushek, 2011; Hanushek and
Rivkin, 2010; Jackson, forthcoming). A challenge facing school administrators in managing the
teacher workforce is that teacher effectiveness is not easy to measure and is not strongly
correlated with observable characteristics. In this type of setting, improved information about
quality can lead to more productive personnel policies. Given the two-sided nature of matches,
better information may also have equity implications because low-achieving schools struggle to
attract and retain good teachers (Bates, 2016; Clotfelter et al., 2006).
In this paper, we study the impact of introducing a rigorous teacher evaluation system on
the level and distribution of teacher quality. The context for our study is the Houston
Independent School District (HISD), which is the seventh largest school district in the United
States. The new evaluation system was phased in from 2011 to 2013 and is centered on a
standardized method for annually evaluating teachers. The objective is to generate
comprehensive teacher performance measures and empower principals to exit ineffective and
retain effective teachers at higher rates, as well as improve ongoing skill development.

Recognizing that teacher hiring and development also play a role in overall policy efficacy, we
focus on how the policy impacted patterns of attrition by teacher effectiveness.
The empirical analyses rely on administrative data tracking teachers for three years
before to three years after the reform. For the subset of teachers in tested grades and subjects we
begin by classifying teachers by quality using proxies we construct and validate for value added
to student achievement. Then, using difference-in-differences and event-study analyses, we show
that the relationships between teacher quality and both school and district exit became more
negative in the post-policy period. The key driver is an increase in the relative likelihood of exit
from the district of teachers in the bottom quintile of the quality distribution, concentrated in
low-achieving schools.
As far as impacts on student achievement through the turnover channel, there are two
important issues to consider. First, overall turnover increased after the reform, though a portion
of this level shift is likely attributable to the economic recovery as turnover returned to prerecession levels statewide. Second, the reform had only moderate impacts on quality per turnover
and the associated improvements in workforce quality are too small to have a detectable impact
on student achievement. We demonstrate this point in illustrative models that relate observed
school-by-grade teacher exits to student achievement gains and simulations that cumulate the
impacts over time.
Our study contributes in a number of ways to the few existing studies of policies that are
designed to improve workforce quality by providing better information on teacher effectiveness.
In contrast to the rigid rules that characterize the high-profile IMPACT program in Washington
DC, which is studied by Dee and Wyckoff (2015), principals in HISD have flexibility in how to

2

act on the performance information.1 The presumption is that they know their own schools best
and can leverage their local knowledge.2 One way to view the HISD system is as a scaled up
version of the experimental pilot interventions studied by Sartain and Steinberg (2016) and
Rockoff et al. (2012), with the added feature of a district-wide emphasis on tying personnel
decisions more closely to quality.3 Beyond differences in the setting in terms of discretion and
scale, we also examine the distributional impacts that can arise when an entire school system is
treated.
2. Policy background
HISD has implemented several policies designed to raise staff quality and effort over the
past decade. First, a merit pay program (ASPIRE) was introduced in 2006-07 to reward teachers
and administrators for raising student achievement. Then, four years later, the district began
phased development and implementation of the Effective Teachers Initiative (ETI). This
comprehensive reform effort is designed to improve teacher quality through more effective
recruitment at the front end, individualized professional development in the middle, and targeted
retention and exit on the back end. The emphasis on tying personnel decisions more closely to
quality was made explicit in differential retention goals for the least and most effective teachers,
with a particular focus on improving teacher quality for high-need students.4 A notable feature of

Using a regression discontinuity design, Dee and Wyckoff (2015) find that dismissal threats associated
with low ratings induce voluntary exit and raise the performance of teachers who remain.
2
Loeb, Miller, and Wyckoff (2015) study a reform that increased principals’ flexibility in decisionmaking in New York City and find that principals are less likely to award tenure to less effective teachers
as measured by value-added and own annual assessments of teacher quality.
3
In their New York City experiment, Rockoff et al. (2012) find that providing principals with improved
information on teacher performance increases the likelihood of exit for low performing teachers. Sartain
and Steinberg (2016) find similar effects of a Chicago pilot program that evaluated teachers more
rigorously via classroom observations.

to shift the distribution of teacher effectiveness.

the new system, which is still in effect today, is that principals are the primary agents of policy
implementation. Further, principals have significant latitude in exiting teachers since, unlike
many districts, teachers at HISD do not have tenure and most teachers are on one-year contracts.
The cornerstone of the ETI reform is the implementation of a rigorous teacher evaluation
system intended to provide more informative reviews of teacher performance. The new
evaluation system was designed by the district during the 2010-11 school year with input from
stakeholders and formally approved by the school board in spring 2011. The new appraisals
involve three components: instructional practice, professional expectations, and student
performance. Scores on the first two components are based on principal observations and
reviews conducted inside and outside the classroom. For instructional practice, a teacher’s skills
are evaluated using well-defined rubrics that cover setting student expectations, lesson planning,
and classroom management. For the professional expectations component, teachers are evaluated
relative to a set of objective measures of compliance with policies, interactions with colleagues,
and participation in professional development. The student performance scores are based on
estimates of a teacher’s impact on student learning. Teachers are scored on a scale from 1 to 4 on
each component, and these are then averaged to deliver summary ratings of ineffective, needs
improvement, effective, or highly effective.
The initial step in transitioning to the new system was ensuring that all teachers were
assigned ratings in 2010-11. Prior to that year, ratings for almost one in three teachers were not
recorded with the district. Further, ratings were high and did not meaningfully differentiate
teachers (Weisberg et al., 2009).5 The 2010-11 ratings were based on at least two classroom
observations and, though not formally scored under the new system, these observations were

Under the former appraisal system, 97% of HISD teachers were rated “proficient” or better.

conducted in an environment where differentiating teachers by quality was a leading district
concern and most principals had already received training.6 In the following year, 2011-12,
teachers were scored under the two new observational components: instructional practice and
professional expectations. Due to delays in approving student performance metrics for teachers
in untested subjects and grades, these metrics were not formally incorporated into the ratings
until 2012-13.7
The phasing of the reform had different implications for the subset of teachers that we
study, who teach in tested subjects and grades, than for other teachers. Student achievement
metrics for these teachers had already been available for many years because the SAS Institute
provided proprietary teacher-level value-added estimates (EVAAS® scores) to HISD as key
inputs to the merit pay system. Thus, the most relevant changes are the addition of the
observational components and the emphasis on differentiating teachers and tying personnel
decisions more closely to quality. While the policy could have affected turnover for all teachers
as early as following the 2010-11 school year, initial impacts were more likely for our subset
because information about efficacy in promoting student learning was already available.8
The superintendent’s message in the district’s 2011 Annual Report conveys this priority: “In 2011, we
took bold steps to transform the way teachers are recruited, trained, evaluated, and retained. […] HISD is
committed to recognizing and rewarding top teachers. And teachers whose students consistently
demonstrate weak academic growth are asked to exit the organization.” Further, highlighted in a box on
the first page of the report is: “In 2010-11, 373 teachers exited the organization for performance reasons.
That’s up from 77 in 2009.”
7
A side effect of the phased implementation is that the official ratings for teachers changed significantly
from 2011-12 to 2012-13. When only the observational components were included, nearly 90% of
teachers were labeled effective or highly effective, with 0.5% ineffective, 10.0% needing improvement,
57.6% effective, and 31.9% highly effective. Once student performance was explicitly factored in, these
shares changed to 6.0%, 27.7%, 39.7%, and 26.6%, respectively. The downward shift is due to the fact
that the student performance measures are relative, so that some teachers will necessarily be deemed
ineffective, while the other criteria are absolute. Unfortunately we do not have access to personnel
evaluations for earlier years to document any initial shifts.
8
Others have shown effects of policies in years prior to formal implementation in settings with
structurally similar rollouts. For example, Butcher, McEwan, and Weerapana (2014) show that academic
6

We examine how the introduction of ETI has affected teacher turnover in ways that are
related to quality. Though turnover is only one channel through which the new human capital
policies could affect the quality of the workforce, it is arguably the lever that principals can
affect most, particularly in the short run. However, it is important to recognize that any impacts
on turnover reflect both demand-side and supply-side responses to the initiative as a whole,
including supporting interventions bundled with the new evaluation system. Teachers are
provided regular feedback on progress and opportunities for development to address their
specific needs, and new leadership roles have been established for effective teachers to mentor
others. Associated changes in the work environment and career opportunities could alter the
relative attractiveness of teaching in the district and of teaching in more and less advantaged
schools for teachers of differing effectiveness. These types of changes are likely inherent to any
rigorous appraisal system.
Something that is more unique to the Houston context is that ETI was introduced against
the backdrop of a merit pay system. Under the system, teachers in core subjects can receive
bonuses for student learning gains exhibited in their classrooms and smaller bonuses for campuswide performance. Prior to ETI, nearly all core teachers received bonuses, with the average
bonus on the order of $3,600 (or about 7 percent of average base salary). With the onset of ETI,
the standards were made more stringent. Whereas it had been sufficient to be in the top half on at
least one teacher-subject or campus measure, qualifying for an award required being closer to the
top 20 percent in 2011-2012. In 2012-13, once ETI was fully phased in, teachers identified as
ineffective or needing improvement by the appraisal system were also disqualified from

receiving campus awards. More details on changes to ASPIRE over the course of our study
period are provided in Appendix A.
The net effect of the post-ETI changes to ASPIRE is that the most effective teachers
maintained similar levels of average awards, while average amounts fell for less effective
teachers (shown in Appendix A). Teachers experienced these changes with a significant lag,
since award details are not available until the spring of the academic year and the awards are
announced and paid in the following year (regardless of whether the individual is still an
employee). The first post-ETI year can be viewed as providing insights about effects in a less
discriminating merit pay regime, while the next two years embed the increasing alignment of the
merit pay program with ETI to the extent that the change was perceived by teachers.9 For
districts that have merit pay programs, such realignment would be expected in response to
changes to how teachers are evaluated.
3. Data and summary statistics
We have access to detailed school, teacher, and student administrative data files for
school years 2007-08 through 2013-14. These data allow us to measure teacher turnover through
2012-13 (where 2013-14 data are used to measure turnover for 2012-13 teachers), leaving us
with a six-year panel centered around 2010-11, which is the first year the human capital policies
began to take force.
3.1 Measuring school disadvantage and selecting analysis schools
We begin with a sample of 201 traditional public schools in HISD that were operational
during our sample period and serve students in grades 3 to 8, which are the grade levels for
The evidence on how ASPIRE incentives affect teacher behavior in HISD is mixed. Imberman and
Lovenheim (2015) find that high school teachers increased effort in response to team incentives under
ASPIRE, but Brehm, Imberman, and Lovenheim (2017) do not find any evidence of strategic effort
responses to individual incentives among teachers in lower grades.

which we are able to construct measures of teacher quality consistently over the course of our
data panel. As a summary measure of each school’s context we use the achievement level, which
is defined as the average of students’ math and reading scores on statewide exams, standardized
within grade and year, and taken over the pre-policy years. We divide schools into three groups
based on pre-policy achievement levels: low (bottom quintile), middle (quintiles 2-4), and high
(top quintile).
After classifying schools by achievement, we exclude an additional set of schools due to
a concurrent intervention conducted in HISD as described by Fryer (2014). Fryer (2014) led an
intervention starting in 2010-11 that introduced a bundle of best practices from effective charter
schools in 15 traditional elementary and middle schools. The onset of the intervention included
changes to teaching and leadership personnel. To avoid contamination, we drop the schools
where Fryer intervened from our analytic sample.10 Consistent with his description, all but one of
these schools are in the bottom quintile of achievement. We assign schools to quintiles prior to
dropping the Fryer schools so that our school groupings are unconditional. This allows for
straightforward interpretation, with the practical consequence that our sample size of bottom
quintile schools is reduced.
Table 1 shows summary statistics for the schools included in our analysis, broken down
by achievement group. The top panel shows differences in the characteristics of the student
bodies served across these schools. Beyond the construct-driven differences in achievement,
low-achieving schools serve a disproportionate share of black students and students with English
as a second language, while high-achieving schools serve markedly fewer economically
disadvantaged students.

10

In Appendix D, we show that our main findings are qualitatively similar if we include these schools.

3.2 Measuring teacher quality and selecting analysis teachers
Critical to our analysis is being able to measure teacher effectiveness in a comparable
way over the full sample period. While teacher experience and education levels might be
candidates, the literature has consistently shown that these observable characteristics explain
little of the variation in student learning and are not consistently linked to teacher quality
(Aaronson, Barrow, and Sander, 2007; Hanushek and Rivkin, 2006; Harris and Sass, 2011). We
also have scores from principal appraisals for the components that were part of the official
evaluation system in 2011-12 and 2012-13, but not only are these unavailable in prior years, the
observational components are difficult to compare across campuses with differentially
challenging environments and map more weakly to student learning (Kane et al., 2011, 2013;
Steinberg and Garrett, 2016; Whitehurst, Chingos, and Lindquist, 2014).
For these reasons, we construct quality measures derived from the value-added estimates
that have been provided to principals for teachers in tested grades and subjects for many years at
HISD. These teacher-specific EVAAS® scores are single-year measures of student test score
growth produced using a propriety method developed by the SAS Institute. Although the
technical estimation details differ from standard value-added models, conceptually they are
similar (Ballou, Sanders, and Wright, 2004). Teachers’ EVAAS® scores are estimated from
regressions of student achievement on a set of indicators for each teacher the student had in the
current and prior two years, as well as indicators for subject, grade, and year. These scores are
available to us back to the 2006-07 school year, and we restrict our analysis to teachers in grades
3-8 who have been assigned math or reading EVAAS® scores.
Because the single-year estimates are quite noisy, we construct a more informative
measure of teacher effectiveness by combining multiple years of teachers’ scores per the

9

following regression based on Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff (2014a):

Vikt  0  Vikt-δ1 ikt

(1)

In equation (1), Vikt is teacher i’s EVAAS® score in subject k and year t, Vikt- is a vector of
teacher i’s EVAAS® scores in the same subject in years prior to year t, and  ikt is an
idiosyncratic error term. The EVAAS® scores are normalized by subject and year. The fitted
values from the regression, Vˆikt  ˆ0  Vikt-δˆ 1 , are jackknifed quality measures where a value of
one, for example, implies that the teacher is one standard deviation above average in the true
distribution for teachers in the district.11 Because not all teachers have a complete panel of prior
scores to be used in the estimation of equation (1), separate regression models are estimated for
all possible combinations as in Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff (2014a). We do require, though,
that the teacher have a time t EVAAS® score to be included in the sample, which ensures the
individual is teaching the relevant subject contemporaneously. An implication of including only
scores from years prior to t as explanatory variables in equation (1) is that first-year teachers are
necessarily excluded from the sample. However, our reliance only on prior-year performance
guards against introducing survivor bias to our turnover analysis, since otherwise teachers who
persist would be more likely to have quality measures available and thus be overrepresented in
our sample.12 Another implication of our strategy is that teacher effectiveness is allowed to drift

The jackknifed quality measures are not renormalized to have a standard deviation of one, and in fact
have a standard deviation less than one. Theoretically, a one-unit change in the jackknifed measures
corresponds to a one standard deviation change in the distribution of teacher quality (see, e.g., Chetty,
Friedman, and Rockoff, 2014b).
12
Our jackknifed measures rely on more observations for teachers in later years of our panel, so it may
seem that a relative reduction in noise could confound our estimated relationships over time. Not only
have we empirically confirmed that our results are robust to restricting the backward-looking windows to
be comparable across years, but the implicit shrinkage is also a theoretical argument against this concern
(Jacob and Lefgren, 2008).
11

10

over time, consistent with the slow-moving process documented by Chetty, Friedman, and
Rockoff (2014a).
It is important to demonstrate that our measures meaningfully capture teacher
effectiveness in raising student achievement. Recent studies show that conceptually similar
jackknifed measures based on value-added are forecast-unbiased estimates of teacher quality in
other contexts (Bacher-Hicks, Kane, and Staiger, 2014; Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff, 2014a).
Adopting their methods, we test whether our measures have the same property by examining
whether changes in teacher quality at the school-by-grade level caused by staffing changes
accurately predict changes in student test scores, as would be expected if the measures are
unbiased. For example, if a teacher with high measured effectiveness moves to a new school
and/or a different grade, test scores for students in the new school-by-grade combination should
increase in the year after the change. Moreover, if the quality metric is properly scaled, the
magnitude of the change in teacher quality should predict the magnitude of the change in student
achievement.
With the caveat that our tests are less powerful than in previous studies that exploit larger
datasets, our findings are consistent with the jackknifed quality measures being forecast unbiased
predictors of future student achievement, as shown in Appendix B. The reading-based teacher
quality estimates appear to be less informative (i.e., noisier), however, which is consistent with
findings in previous research (Backes et al., 2016; Lefgren and Sims, 2012). Thus, we choose to
present results restricted to teachers for whom we can observe effectiveness in teaching math.13
Across our sample years, one-fifth of the teachers in our schools are teaching math in a tested
grade, and one-fifth of these have no available prior math scores to calculate our jackknifed

That said, Appendix D shows that results for reading teachers are qualitatively similar.

measure. Thus, in the end, our analysis sample represents 16.4 percent of teachers in our
schools.14
The middle panel of Table 1 shows how math teacher quality is distributed across schools
grouped by achievement level in the pre-policy period. In addition to our measure of
effectiveness, where the numbers reported are in standard deviations of the teacher distribution,
we also include other observable teacher characteristics. Based on our measure, Table 1 shows
that teacher quality is not evenly distributed across the district. More low-quality teachers and
fewer high-quality teachers are found at low-achieving schools. Low-achieving schools also
employ teachers with less experience and more education, but we place little emphasis on these
differences in observed qualifications because a simple regression of our jackknifed quality
measure in math on teacher experience and indicators for education levels yields an R-squared of
just 0.01.
Finally, we note that our quality measure is not directly available to school principals.
Instead, principals have access to year-by-year EVAAS® scores and post-policy observational
assessments, in addition to other indicators of quality that we do not observe. In 2012-13, the
first year that all components of the assessment were formally scored, our measure of quality
explains 24 percent of the variation in overall appraisal ratings among our sample of teachers. It
explains 13, 4, and 23 percent of the instructional practice, professionalism, and student
performance components, respectively. One reason that the correlation with the classroomobservation component is not higher may be that scores on these types of best-practices metrics
have been shown to be sensitive to the composition of students in the classroom (Steinberg and
Teachers who are not responsible for math instruction in a tested grade primarily teach students below
grade 3 or students in other subjects (particularly in middle schools), or are non-classroom teachers who
focus on special populations such as special needs students and English language learners (ELLs). The
share of ELL teachers is especially large at HISD.

Garrett, 2016; Whitehurst, Chingos, and Lindquist, 2014). That said, both across and within
schools, our jack-knifed quality measures are more predictive than single-year EVAAS® scores
of the non-test-based evaluation components.15 Thus, in addition to being an informative
measure of how decisions under the new system are likely to affect student achievement, our
measures are also better aligned than single-year EVAAS® scores with the other formal
evaluation criteria in the system.
3.3 Measuring teacher turnover
In addition to measuring school exits, we decompose school exits into exits from the
district and transfers to other schools within the district. A complication we face is that the
staffing data provided to us in 2013-14 include only teachers. In all previous years the staffing
data include all positions. For consistency, throughout our analysis we identify a teacher as
having exited the school at the conclusion of year t if the teacher is not observed teaching in the
school in year t+1. Thus, we code switches to non-teaching positions (e.g., school leadership) as
exits. We have confirmed that our results are substantively the same if we exclude the last year
of data and code position changes as non-exits.16
We define teacher turnover by looking forward in the data one year. A benefit of using a
single-year measure instead of a multi-year measure is that we can calculate turnover for more
years. That said, the limitation of the single-year exit measures is that they are noisy and
overstate exit rates. It has been well documented that teachers – particularly young teachers –
move in and out of the workforce (Grissom and Reininger, 2012). We therefore test robustness to
using alternative two-year definitions for campus and district exit, where a teacher is classified as
For example, our measures explain 10-20 percent more of the across- and within-school variance in
2012-13 teachers’ instructional practice scores than single-year EVAAS® scores.
16
While the overall annual exit rates decline slightly (1-2 percentage points) if we recode position
changes as non-exits, the across-year differences are hardly affected. See Appendix D.

having exited if she is also not present in year t+2.
The bottom panel of Table 1 shows single-year turnover rates for math teachers in grades
3-8 in the pre-policy period. Pre-policy turnover is 13.7 percent at low- and middle-achieving
schools, versus 12.1 percent at high-achieving schools. The difference is driven primarily by a
lower rate of within-district transfer from high-achieving schools. Unsurprisingly, two-year exit
rates (not shown) indicate marginally lower turnover by approximately 0.4 percentage points, or
3 percent.17
4. Empirical strategy
To estimate effects on turnover, we begin with difference-in-differences models of the
following form, specified as linear probability models:

Yist  0  1Postt  2Qit  3 Postt  Qit  Xstβ  s   ist

(2)

In equation (2), Yist is a binary variable indicating whether teacher i at school s exits the school
(or exits the district or transfers to another school) at the conclusion of year t, Postt is an
indicator set to one for 2010-11 and later years, and Qit is our measure of teacher quality.18 In
some variants of the model, we replace the continuous measure of teacher quality with a vector
of indicator variables for the bottom, middle-three, and top quality quintiles. While these variants
have the advantage of allowing for nonlinear effects, we lead with the more parametric model
since it has the advantage of parsimony and nicely summarizes whether the link between quality
and turnover strengthened on average following the reform. The X-vector contains teacher

The pre-policy turnover statistics in Table 1 are similar to turnover statistics provided for grade 4 to 5
teachers in New York City by Ronfeldt, Loeb, and Wyckoff (2013).
18
Shrinkage is implicit in the jackknifing procedure and thus our estimates will not be affected by
attenuation bias from using a generated regressor as would be the case with a standard linear predictor
(Jacob and Lefgren, 2008).
17

14

characteristics that might have independent effects on turnover, such as race, gender, experience,
and education. Our findings are not sensitive to which subset of these characteristics we include
in the regressions, nor are they sensitive to omitting the X-vector entirely. Finally,  s is a school
fixed effect to allow for fixed school attributes that affect teacher attrition rates, and  ist is an
error term. Throughout we report standard errors clustered at the school level.
The objective of the model is to identify shifts in the relationship between teacher quality
and exit over time, embodied by  3 . We also report estimates of  1 to give a sense of how the
overall teacher exit rate changes over time. To the extent that the change can be attributed to
policy implementation, it is indicative of impact on the extensive margin. Of course, it is difficult
to rule out that other time-varying factors are at play when estimating these simple differences.
Thus, we emphasize estimates of  3 , which is the coefficient on the interaction between the postreform indicator and teacher quality. This parameter provides an indication of the policy impact
on the intensive margin – that is, on a per-exit basis it provides a measure of how workforce
quality is changing due to push and pull factors associated with the reform. Since a primary goal
of the policy was to increase exit of ineffective teachers and increase retention of effective
teachers, we would expect to find a negative coefficient on the interaction.
A necessary condition for identifying the policy impact on relative exit rates is that prepolicy trends in exit rates between teachers of different levels of quality are the same. To explore
the validity of the design, as well as to provide evidence on the time pattern of any responses, we
also estimate event time models. For these time-disaggregated models, we include a full set of
year effects and year effects interacted with teacher quality.
Beyond estimating average impacts, we also study heterogeneity across schools to shed
light on distributional effects. For these models, we add interactions between the time and quality
15

variables with indicators for schools that are low (bottom-quintile) and high (top-quintile)
achieving based on pre-period achievement. Improving teacher quality at schools serving highneed students was a priority under ETI, and principals at these schools might also benefit more
from the information provided by the new system. However, they may also have less capacity to
respond because demand for effective teachers likely increased system-wide, opening up the
possibility for the best teachers to trade-up in terms of school environment and making retention
tougher at the bottom (Bates, 2016).
5. Effects of the reform on turnover
5.1 Descriptive analysis
We begin by visually documenting trends in exit and turnover rates in Figure 1. The
figure shows district-wide trends for our three different mobility measures: school exit, district
exit, and school transfer. The former is the sum of the two latter measures. School years in the
figure, and in all figures and tables to follow, are identified by the spring year – e.g., the 2010-11
school year is labeled as 2011.
The figure shows that turnover by all three measures began to rise at the conclusion of the
2010-11 school year. Of total school exits, roughly half of the observed increase is due to an
increase in district exits, and half is due to an increase in within-district school transfers. It is
difficult to determine how much of the increase in overall turnover is attributable to the policy
change. This six-year period spans the Great Recession. Unemployment peaked in 2009 and
gradually declined over the next several years. In Appendix C, using panel data on teachers from
neighboring and other large Texas districts, we show a consistent U-shaped pattern in turnover
over this period, with turnover returning to initial levels by the final year. Thus, much of the
post-reform increase appears to be unique to HISD, suggesting the policy played at least some

16

role.
Figure 2 provides similar information to Figure 1 but divides teachers into groups based
on our measure of quality. Teachers are assigned to the following groups based on their
placement in the quality distribution: bottom quintile (least effective), middle quintiles (quintiles
2-3-4), and top quintile (most effective). The three panels report the rates of school exit, district
exit, and school transfer for the three teacher quality groups. It is visually apparent that the
school exit rate increased more quickly in the post-policy period for the least effective teachers
relative to other teachers, driven primarily by district exits. Although instances of school
transfers are higher in the post-policy years overall, no systematic change in the relationship
between teacher quality and school switching is apparent in Figure 2.
One might worry that the economic recovery also confounds our ability to attribute the
differential changes in exit by quality to the reform. That is, more effective teachers might
respond differently to secular changes in outside options. Here, the existing literature does not
offer much guidance. The only paper that we are aware of that considers the role of the economy
on teachers transitions by quality studies effects on selection at entry, finding that teachers who
enter during a recession are more effective on average (Nagler, Piopiunik, and West, 2015). It is
difficult to extrapolate this finding to the exit decision, and unfortunately we do not have access
to teacher quality measures for other Texas districts to offer a counterfactual. It is reassuring,
though, that turnover was trending similarly across teacher quality groups for the three years
prior to the reform despite the changing economic conditions (Figure 2). In the empirical
analyses, we more formally address this point by testing for differential pre-trends and for
sensitivity to a teacher’s level of experience.

17

5.2 Estimation results
We estimate the models described in Section 4 to assess the significance and robustness
of the patterns illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. First, Table 2 shows results from equation (2) where
we enter the teacher-quality measure into the regressions linearly. We report results for the full
specification, which is our preferred model, but in unreported results our estimates are very
similar if we use sparser variants of the model that exclude teacher characteristics and even
school fixed effects. For each turnover outcome, we present models that aggregate the pre- and
post-policy time periods and models that fully disaggregate years. All control variables except
for the post-period indicator (or year indicators) are mean-centered in the regressions, including
the school indicator variables, so that the intercept can be interpreted as the exit rate at the mean
values of all covariates.19
The general patterns from Figures 1 and 2 are reflected in the model estimates and
confirmed to be statistically significant in Table 2. For example, in the model of district exits,
our estimate in column (2a) implies that a teacher who is one standard deviation above average
in the quality distribution is an additional 6.3 percentage points less likely to exit the district
during the post-policy relative to the pre-policy period. The estimated impact is attenuated for
the inclusive school exit outcome in column (1a) since, as suggested by Figure 2 and shown in
column (3a), there is no change in the relationship between school switching and teacher quality.
Though we do not emphasize the pre-policy patterns in exit by quality, we find that less effective
teachers were more likely to exit the district and less likely to transfer to a new school within the

The mean-centering does not affect model fit or the coefficients on the key parameters interacting time
with teacher quality. It is used only to improve interpretability of the results with regard to the overall exit
rate (Dalal and Zickar, 2012).

district prior to policy implementation.20
The event time models in the table are useful for two reasons. First, they document that
there were no pre-trends in turnover by quality (i.e., the coefficients on the interactions between
teacher quality and the 2009 and 2010 indicators, which are estimated relative to the holdout year
2008, are small and statistically insignificant). Moreover, though the causal impact on overall
turnover rates is not well identified by our model, the pre-period trend is in the opposite direction
of what we see in the post period. A second benefit of the disaggregated models is that, in
principle, they allow us to test how impacts evolve over time. We do tend to find the largest and
most statistically significant impacts in the final year, but are unfortunately not sufficiently
powered to differentiate these from the estimates for the other reform years.
Next, in Table 3 we show results from models where we replace the linear quality
measures in equation (2) with indicators for teachers’ quality-quintile groups. The indicator
identifying teachers in the middle quintiles (2-3-4) is omitted for comparison. We do not show
the intercept coefficients and interactions to preserve space. Consistent with what we show in
Figure 2, Table 3 confirms that the post-policy period is marked by a large and statistically
significant increase in the likelihood of school and district exit for low-performing teachers
relative to middle and high performing teachers. Between these two latter groups there is no
divergence in exit rates.
Table 4 reports on the robustness of our findings to two adjustments to the analysis. First,
in the left panel, we consider the sensitivity of our results to using a 2-year exit measure for
school and district exits. That is, rather than coding exits based on looking forward just one year
Studies of teacher mobility in Florida (Feng and Sass, 2017; West and Chingos, 2009) and North
Carolina (Goldhaber, Gross, and Player, 2010) find less effective teachers are more likely to exit the
school for any reason. Within HISD we find less effective teachers are no more or less likely to stay in the
same school, since the higher rate of district exit is offset by a lower rate of school transfer within HISD.

20

19

in the data, we look forward two years to determine whether the exiting teacher remained either
(a) out of the school or (b) out of the district. When we make this definitional change, we are no
longer able to examine outcomes for the 2013 teacher cohort. Thus, we report results from
models covering the 2008-2012 cohorts using the one-year and two-year exit definitions, which
are otherwise comparable to the results we show in Table 2. Although the overall levels of exit
are slightly lower with the two-year definition, the patterns in our estimates are very similar
across the two definitions.
In the right panel of Table 4 we return to using our full dataset and single-year exit
measures and replicate the analysis in Table 2 (columns 1a, 2a, and 3a) after restricting the
models to include only schools that did not experience a principal change. Changes in leadership
are one mechanism by which the new evaluation system could influence the workforce.
Approximately 38 percent of schools in our analytic sample retained the same principal over the
course of the full data panel (this number is in line with data on principal tenure in Texas as
reported by Branch, Hanushek, and Rivkin, 2012). The results are generally similar to what we
report in Table 3, which suggests that principal changes are not a critical mediator of our
findings.
Table 5 shows results from models run separately for teachers by experience level. We
divide teachers into three groups based on experience: ≤ 5 years, 6-20 years, and more than 20
years, and run the model for each turnover outcome separately for each group. Overall exit rates
increased for all experience groups and although noisily estimated, the pre-post change in the
relationship between quality and exit/transfer is similar across experience groups. The
consistency by experience is surely facilitated in part by the absence of tenure at HISD and the
fact that teachers are primarily on 1-year contracts. This result would be unlikely to generalize to

20

districts with strong tenure protections (Sartain and Steinberg, 2016).
Finally, in Table 6 we estimate models that are otherwise the same as those shown in
Table 2, but we replace our jackknifed teacher quality measures with single-year EVAAS®
scores. The results clearly show that turnover in the post period aligns much more strongly with
our jackknifed quality measures – which are unobserved by principals and district officials, at
least directly – than with the noisier current-year EVAAS® scores, which are observed. This
result is consistent with the interpretation that personnel decisions under the reform are being
made based on more comprehensive evidence than the current-year scores.
6. Heterogeneity in effects across schools
6.1 Descriptive analysis
In Figure 3, we replicate the information shown in Figure 1, but separately for each
school type. Recall that we divide schools into three groups based on their pre-policy location in
the distribution of average achievement in math and reading: bottom quintile (low-achieving),
middle quintiles (quintiles 2-3-4), and top quintile (high-achieving). The figure shows that while
exit rates increased across all three groups in the post-policy period, there has been a
disproportionate increase at the lowest-achieving schools.21
Figure 4 further divides teachers by quality within the same school groups. Reading
across a row in Figure 4 holds the school-achievement group fixed, and reading down a column
holds the teacher quality group fixed. Although the graphs in the figure cut the data thinly, and
therefore noise is an issue, they suggest several interesting patterns. For instance, the first row of
graphs shows school-exit, district-exit, and school-transfer patterns at low-achieving schools, by

Appendix C shows that though the U-shaped pattern in exits across years is more pronounced for
disadvantaged schools in neighboring and other large districts, the levels also return only to initial levels
and do not exceed these.

21

teacher type. The clear bars across the first row illustrate that low-performing teachers at lowachieving schools were much more likely to exit the district in the post-policy period relative to
the pre-policy period. However, when looking at rates of school exit (black bars), the pre-post
change relative to other teachers at these schools shrinks because school-transfer rates (gray
bars) climb for middle- and high-performing teachers. Bates (2016) suggests a potential
mechanism – namely, more effective teachers under the new system have more prominent
signals of their ability than had previously been the case and can leverage these signals into more
desirable teaching positions. In the absence of true compensating wage differentials, as is typical
in the public education context, teachers will prefer positions that are more desirable along nonpecuniary dimensions (Greenberg and McCall, 1974).22
Turning to middle-achieving schools, there is also a more pronounced increase in district
exit rates for low-performing teachers. In this case, there is not an offsetting school-changer
effect. For high-achieving schools, school changing is relatively stable across years for all
teacher quality groups, and the difference in the pre-post increases in district exits between lowand high-performing teachers is muted.
6.2 Estimation results
We add interaction terms to equation (2) to test whether the patterns suggested by Figures
3 and 4 are statistically significant in our difference-in-differences specification. Table 7 presents
results from models that use the linear quality measures, like in Table 2, but with the added
interactions for school type.23 The heterogeneity parameters of interest interact the post-policy

Teachers may prefer higher-achieving schools for a variety of reasons. Survey evidence suggests that
while teachers do prefer to work with higher-SES students, perhaps because this requires less effort,
simple non-pecuniary benefits that are correlated with student SES, like better administrative support and
shorter commute times, are more important in pushing teachers toward high-SES schools (Horng, 2009).
23
Models that use teacher quintile groups in place of the linear quality measure, akin to what we show
visually in Figure 4, yield estimates that are too imprecise to be informative.
22

22

indicator with teacher quality and school type, where bottom- and top-quintile schools are
included in the model and compared to the holdout group of middle-quintile schools. The bottom
two rows of Table 7 show coefficient estimates and standard errors for these triple interactions.
To interpret the findings in Table 7, first note that the post-policy effect on the
relationship between each measure of turnover and teacher quality for middle-achieving schools
is shown in row 4. By virtue of their omission from the model as the holdout group, the double
interaction of quality and the post-period indicator is the effect for these schools. The estimates
in Table 7 for middle-quintile schools are similar to the analogous global estimates shown in
Table 2. For bottom quintile schools, the triple interaction coefficients in the second-to-last row
indicate the quality effect at these schools relative to middle quintile schools. Although the
estimates are noisy and merely suggestive, they imply that some of the benefits arising from a
more negative relationship between quality and district exit (column 2) is dulled by a more
positive relationship between quality and school transfer (column 3). For top-quintile schools,
the triple-interaction estimates indicate that the net effect of the reform is essentially null. That
is, the triple-interaction terms in the final row of Table 7 offset the baseline effects in row 4.
7. Discussion and interpretation
Given that we measure teacher quality in terms of effectiveness and validate the
predictive power of our measures over student achievement, it is reasonable to expect that gains
in student learning would align with the change in the quality composition of exiters. However,
whether or not gains are realized also depends on any impacts on the quality of teacher entrants
and on effort among teachers who remain (Rothstein, 2015). Inference is further clouded by the
high turnover rate among teachers in our sample post-ETI. Since turnover increases as much as it
does, to the extent that this turnover is attributable to the policy and adversely affects

23

achievement, it could imply net losses for students.
In order to gauge how the turnover aspects of the policy might be expected to affect
student achievement, we estimate models of changes in school-by-grade math achievement of
the following form:

Asgt  0  ΔXsgt β1  TOsgt 2  [ BQsgt 3  MQsgt  4  TQsgt 5  UK sgt 6 ]   s   t  usgt

(3)

In equation (3), Asgt is the difference in average test scores across student cohorts in school s
and grade g from period t-1 to t.24 The focal explanatory variables are the change in the level of
math teacher turnover the two cohorts were exposed to, TOsgt , and the share of math teachers
exiting between years by quality group, where teachers are weighted by the number of students
taught. The quality groups are denoted by BQsgt , MQsgt , TQsgt , and UK sgt for bottom-quintile,
middle-quintiles, top-quintile, and unknown teacher quality, respectively. We include the
unknown category to account for math teachers without jackknifed quality measures, which
makes these four categories exhaustive. The vector ΔXsgt captures changes in student
demographic characteristics across cohorts, while  s and  t are school and year fixed effects,
respectively. This model is similar to the model estimated by Adnot et al. (2017) except we
control not only for the level of teacher turnover across cohorts, which captures changes in the
composition of teachers, but also for changes in exposure to turnover, which captures differential
disruption.
The results are shown in Table 8. While the estimates should be viewed cautiously
because they rely on realized differences in turnover across grades, they seem quite plausible.

Each observation is weighted by time t school-by-grade student enrollment, and standard errors are
clustered at the school-by-grade level.
24

24

The estimated coefficients on the exit shares of bottom, middle, and high quality teachers are
0.172, 0.066, and -0.169, respectively. Further supporting the validity of our quality measures,
these align closely with the average jackknifed effectiveness measures for each group, which are
-0.132, 0.012, and 0.175, respectively (converted to student standard deviation units). The
estimated coefficient on the change in turnover implies that there is a disruption effect
(Hanushek, Rivkin and Schiman, 2016; Ronfeldt, Loeb, and Wyckoff, 2013), which we estimate
to be 0.088 student-level standard deviations for a school-by-grade cell that experiences 100
percent turnover. If we attribute all of the observed increase in turnover to the reform, student
achievement would be predicted to fall by 0.012 standard deviations through this channel.
Setting aside the potential disruption effect, we now use the estimates from Table 3
(columns 1a and 2a) to perform a back-of-the-envelope calculation of the impact of the reform
on student achievement through the changing quality of leavers. Figure 5 suitably repackages the
estimates, using them to calculate the implied shares of leavers falling into each teacher quality
quintile group before and after the reform. Specifically, we use the estimated coefficients on the
quality and time indicators, and their interactions, to predict the exit rate for each quality group
by period. We then multiply these rates by the group shares to calculate the overall exit rate and
the group exit shares. Combined with our estimates of group-specific differences in teacher
effectiveness, the pre-post shift toward more low-performing teacher exits shown in Figure 5
implies that the effectiveness of school (district) leavers falls by just 0.007 (0.007) student
standard deviations, on average.
While small, there are three dimensions along which these back-of-the-envelope
magnitudes may be viewed as conservative. First, note that any given percentage-point
difference in the likelihood of exit across teacher groups (per Table 3) will map to a smaller

25

difference in percent shares of exits the higher is the level of turnover. Thus, the fact that
turnover rose following the reform means that the amount of increased targeting that we estimate
translates into smaller compositional changes than if overall turnover had remained constant.
Had turnover risen by only half as much (which we simulate by cutting the coefficient on the
post-policy indicator in half), the estimated achievement effects increase but remain small, at
around 0.012 (0.013) student standard deviations per turnover.
Second, ETI was being phased in over our post-reform period, with student achievement
formally incorporated only in the most recent year of our data panel, 2013. Impacts observed in
this year may be most relevant for evaluating the policy under full implementation. If we repeat
our calculations but this time use point estimates for the policy effects from 2013 in place of the
pooled point estimates (columns 1b and 2b in Table 3), the expected average change in
achievement rises to 0.012 and 0.009 student standard deviations per turnover for school and
district exits, respectively.
The third dimension involves the longer-term effects of the policy on workforce quality
overall. Following the logic of Winters and Cowen (2013) we iterate over 10 years, recognizing
that our estimates of policy impacts become less informative as the workforce evolves. Since we
attempt to isolate the role of the attrition channel, we hold the quality distribution of replacement
teachers fixed to match the initial distribution. The district quality distribution evolves over time
owing to differential attrition and we hold the exit rates by quintile-group fixed. Considering
variants that make alternative assumptions about the district-level turnover rate, we find effects
on average workforce quality over a 10-year horizon on the order of just 0.01 student-level
standard deviations. Note that the average workforce effects are diluted because the per-turnover
effects documented above are spread across all teachers.

26

We conclude from these calculations that while the change in the composition of
turnovers induced by the policy is in the right direction, exits are not targeted well enough to
induce meaningful achievement gains. Our results in this regard are smaller than what one might
expect based on simulation studies that examine the potential for improved personnel policies to
raise workforce quality (Staiger and Rockoff, 2010; Winters and Cowen, 2013). One reason for
the smaller on-the-ground effect size is that the policies in the simulation studies are based on
value-added and, while careful to account for inaccuracies in the value-added estimates
themselves, they do not account for the fact that systems that have been put into place in practice
incorporate non-test-based evaluation components are less aligned with how teachers affect
student achievement (Kane et al., 2011). In any evaluation of program efficacy centered on
student achievement, personnel decisions that incorporate information from such measures will
appear to be mis-targeted.25 A second possible reason for the smaller impacts is that we study
just the first few years under the new system at HISD, and the effectiveness of the policy may
improve over time as agents gain experience with the new regime (Ahn and Vigdor, 2014).
8. Conclusion
We study the effects on workforce composition of the introduction of a new, morerigorous teacher evaluation system in the Houston Independent School District. The new system
clearly affected the composition of exiting teachers, primarily by increasing the exit rate among
low performers relative to higher-performing teachers. Policy activity along this dimension has
been concentrated at low-achieving schools within the district; at high-achieving schools, there is

Teacher effects on outcomes other than test scores also vary substantially and are not highly correlated
with teacher effects on test scores (Jackson, forthcoming), which is a rationale for the inclusion of
multiple measures in teacher evaluations. However, to date there is little evidence connecting the nontest-based measures used in teacher evaluations to teacher effectiveness as measured by non-test student
outcomes.
25

27

little indication that the nature of personnel decisions changed in the post-policy years.
Our analysis illustrates the potential for more rigorous teacher evaluations to improve
student outcomes via better-informed personnel decisions, but also highlights a critical challenge
associated with improving workforce quality via selective attrition. In short, in the system we
study there are simply too many poorly targeted exits in the post-policy period (by middle- and
top-performing teachers) for the net policy effect on achievement to be meaningful. There are
also other ways that the new system is designed to improve instruction and student outcomes
about which our study is silent – notably via recruitment and greater improvement among
incumbent teachers – but on the dimension of selective attrition, the compositional effects have
not been large enough to measurably improve student achievement.
Stepping back from our narrow policy context, a possible complementary intervention
that might help stem the tide of higher-quality teacher exits would be to offer more competitive
wages that better reflect differences in teacher quality, as argued in Rothstein (2015). Increased
pay for exceptional performance is a key feature of the IMPACT program in Washington DC
(Dee and Wyckoff, 2015). Although HISD has attempted to better align pay with productivity,
its merit pay program has faced challenges and taken only partial steps in that direction (Brehm,
Imberman, and Lovenheim, 2017; Shifrer, Turley, and Heard, 2013).

Notes: The columns present summary statistics for analysis schools divided into three groups based on pre-policy
achievement levels, averaged across reading and math: bottom quintile, middle three quintiles, and top quintile. The
bottom-quintile sample is smaller because treated schools in Fryer’s 2014 study are omitted and also because lowachieving schools have lower enrollment on average. School exits are the sum of district exits and school transfers.
As described in the text, our analytic dataset excludes first-year teachers and correspondingly these teachers are also
excluded from the teacher summary statistics.

Notes: ** Denotes statistical significance at the 5 percent level; * Denotes statistical significance at the 10 percent
level. Standard errors clustered by school are reported in parentheses. Observations for teachers during the 2011,
2012, and 2013 school years are coded as “POST” in columns 1a, 2a, and 3a. In these columns, the parameters for
the variables interacted with POST are estimated relative to the pre-period years. In columns 1b, 2b, and 3b, the
year-specific parameters are estimated relative to 2008, which is the first year of our data panel. All variables in the
regressions other than the post indicator (or year indicators) are mean-centered so the intercept can be interpreted as
the exit rate at the mean values of all covariates. The coefficients for all variables other than the teacher quality
measures and the intercept, both interacted with time, are excluded for brevity.

Notes: The estimates in this table are comparable to estimates in Table 2 and the notes to Table 2 apply. In the left panel, we examine teacher cohorts in 2008-12
only, for whom we can define exits looking forward both 1 and 2 years in the data, to examine the sensitivity of our findings to the exit definition holding all else
equal. In the right panel, we return to using our primary single-year exit definition and 2008-13 cohorts, but restrict the sample to include only schools in which
there was not a principal change over the course of the data panel.

Appendix A. Additional background on HISD policies
The teacher evaluation reform: ETI
One of the priorities of the ETI reform was to encourage retention of more effective
educators and exit of less effective educators. Combined with hiring better teachers and offering
individualized training to existing teachers, the hope was to shift the distribution of teacher
effectiveness in the district. Figure A1 is taken from “Teacher appraisal systems: how one urban
school district is linking effective teaching to student achievement,” presented by Superintendent
Grier at the American Association of School Administrators meeting on February 17, 2012. It
nicely illustrates the role of the three complementary levers.
Selective retention/exit has continued to be an important focus in HISD. For example, the
retention rate of highly effective teachers and exit rate of ineffective teachers are among the set
of key indicators of progress reported in the annual Facts and Figures brief released by HISD to
the public. These indicators were first included in the 2012-13 brief and, in that year, statistics
were reported for differential turnover following the 2010-11 and 2011-12 school years.

The merit pay system: ASPIRE
The merit pay system was first introduced in 2006-07. In Table A1, we show the
evolution of the provisions that are relevant to teachers of core subjects in grades 3-8 over our
study period. As far as generosity of the awards for recipients, amounts were increased in 200809 and then reduced in 2011-12, before another increase in 2012-13. The share of teachers
receiving any award fell slightly in 2010-11, due to the introduction of a teacher attendance
requirement and minimum threshold for student growth. There were more dramatic falls in the
share in 2011-12, when performance targets jumped, and 2012-13, when low student growth

44

precluded teachers from receiving campus awards. Teachers experienced these changes with a
lag, since awards are announced and paid the following year (regardless of whether the teacher is
still an employee).
Figure A2 shows the implications for the math teachers who are the subject of our
empirical analyses. In the figure teachers are assigned to quality quintiles using the jackknife
method described in the main text. The first graph shows that award receipt was nearly universal
in the pre-period. The share receiving awards fell steadily across years after the reform, with
greater drops for the lower quality groups. The fluctuations in average award amounts across
years in the middle graph primarily reflect statutory changes to the generosity of the maximums
(Table A1), with the cut in 2011-12 and the increase in 2012-13. Finally, the last graph shows
average award amounts unconditional on receipt. Here it is clear that the changes to provisions in
2010-11 had minimal effects, while the subsequent changes ultimately lowered average awards
for bottom quintile teachers by more than two-thirds and for middle-quintile teachers by almost
one-third. The top quintile was more or less held harmless on this dimension.

Appendix B. Validating our teacher quality measures
In order to validate our teacher quality measures, we test whether changes in teacher
quality at the school-by-grade level caused by staffing changes accurately predict changes in
student test scores, as would be expected if our quality measures are unbiased (Chetty, Friedman
and Rockoff, 2014a).26 We implement the forecasting test by estimating the following regression
model, weighted by time t school-by-grade enrollment:

  1  ΔXsgt γ 2  t   sgkt
Asgkt   0  Vˆsgkt

(B1)

The dependent variable, Asgkt , is the change in the average test score on the statewide exam
(standardized by grade and year) between years t and t-1 for school s and grade g in subject k.
Only students taught by a teacher with an available effectiveness measure at time t are included
in the regression and used to calculate Asgkt . In addition to year effects, the control set includes

 , which is the change in average measured teacher quality, and ΔXsgt , which captures the
Vˆsgkt
change in student demographics between years t and t-1.
For the purposes of the validation exercise, we make adjustments to the way teacher
quality is measured, which is why the variable is denoted with a prime in equation (B1). First, we
rescale teachers’ EVAAS® scores to student exam score units. This permits one-to-one
forecasting between the teacher quality metrics and the dependent variable. Then, we calculate
leave-two-year-out jackknife estimates, where neither the time t nor the t-1 teacher scores are

There is an ongoing debate between Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff (2017) and Rothstein (2017) about the
informational value of this test. Rothstein (2017) implements various parametric solutions to potential problems and
concludes that the necessary assumptions do not hold. Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff (2017) argue that his
parametric approaches likely generate biases themselves, and that non-parametric tests do not indicate any problems
with the methodology. They further note that even Rothstein’s estimates of forecast bias range from just 5-15
percent across specifications, which still implies that these are meaningful measures of effectiveness.

included in Vikt- (from equation 1 in the main text). This is important to remove the influence of
the mechanical correlation between the change in average student test scores between those two
periods and the estimation error in the annual teacher scores. We conduct the test for both purely
backward looking quality measures and, to increase precision, for measures that also allow postperiod performance data to inform the current-year quality measure (as in Chetty, Friedman, and
Rockoff, 2014a). Jackknifing based on pre- and post-period data is not a problem for this
exercise because internally valid estimates of forecasting bias can still be obtained even if
survivors are over-sampled.
We test the null hypothesis  1  1 separately for math and reading and report the results
in Table B1. We cannot reject that the coefficient on the change in teacher quality is unity in any
of the models. The larger standard errors in the reading regressions leave open the possibility of
non-negligible bias and suggest more individual-level prediction errors, leading to our focus on
math in the main text (though we provide comparable results for reading in Appendix D).

Appendix C. Statewide trends in teacher turnover
The period we study is one where economic conditions were not stable. With
unemployment rates peaking in September 2009, and then steadily declining after, our postpolicy period overlaps with an economic recovery. To explore how the level of teacher turnover
varied with economic conditions in Texas, we compiled a statewide panel of personnel and
campus data.
The personnel files are from the Texas Public Education Information Management
System (PEIMS) and include all full-FTE teachers in traditional public schools that cover any
grade 3-8. In order to classify schools by achievement levels comparably to our analysis of
HISD, we combine TAKS pass rate data for three springs (2007-08, 2008-09 and 2009-10). The
pass rate is the average across math and reading for all grades. Consistent with our analysis of
HISD data, we divide schools into three groups based on their placement in their respective
districts’ pass rate distributions: bottom quintile, middle quintiles, and top quintile.
In Figure C1 we show trends in the three measures of turnover we focus on in our
analysis of HISD – school exits, district exits, and school changes (within district) – across three
samples of Texas school districts: (a) all districts other than HISD, (b) the five largest districts
excluding HISD, and (c) districts adjacent to HISD. The state data also allow us to track exits
from Texas, which we additionally include in the charts. Across all three samples, there is
evidence of a U-shaped pattern in turnovers. Notably, though turnover rates rise smoothly over
the last years of the period, they tend to return to the levels in the initial year. This differs from
the case for HISD shown in Figure 1, where rates jump up in 2011 and are well above the prepolicy baseline by 2013.

51

Figures C2a, C2b and C2c are comparable to Figure 3. Each figure shows turnover rates
broken down by school achievement group (within district) for one of the three district samples,
as indicated by the letter (a, b or c). As in HISD, the U-shape is more marked for lower achieving
schools. However, once again, turnover rates return only to initial levels by the end of the period
whereas in HISD they far exceed them, with the most striking increase at low-achieving HISD
schools.

Alief, Stafford, Fort Bend, Alvin, Pearland, Pasadena, Galena Park, Sheldon, Humble, Aldine). The turnover rates are teacher-weighted so they can be interpreted
as the likelihood of exit for the typical teacher in each sample of districts.

Appendix D. Supplementary tables
Because of the data limitation described in the text, for the 2013 cohort we must code
moves to non-teaching positions as exits. For consistency in the analysis in the main text, we
code moves to non-teaching positions as exits in all years. Table D1 shows results comparable to
our main results in Table 2 but restricted to data from teacher cohorts between 2008 and 2012.
For these cohorts we can estimate models of exit where (a) moves to non-teaching positions are
treated as exits and (b) moves to non-teaching positions are not treated as exits.
Table D1 shows that this data limitation has no bearing on our findings, as results using
both coding schemes are very similar for the 2008-2012 cohorts. This can be seen by comparing
the (a) and (b) columns for each type of turnover. Note that the overall quality coefficients for
the post-policy period are lower than in Table 2 because the policy impacts were highest in 2013,
which is excluded from these models.

Notes: Standard errors clustered by school are reported in parentheses. Observations for teachers during the 2011
and 2012 school years are coded as “POST”. Parameters for the variables interacted with POST are estimated
relative to the pre-period years. All variables in the regressions other than the post indicator are mean-centered so
the intercept can be interpreted as the exit rate at the mean values of all covariates. The coefficients for all variables
other than the teacher quality measures and the intercept, both interacted with time, are excluded for brevity.

based on student test-score growth in reading instead of math. The results are qualitatively
similar to what we show for math. Note that there is substantial overlap in the reading and math
teacher samples (that is, there are many teachers who are responsible for student instruction in
math and reading – e.g., self-contained elementary teachers).
