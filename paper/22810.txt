ABSTRACT
The length of time from the implementation of an occupational licensing statute (i.e., licensing
duration) may matter in influencing labor market outcomes. Adding to or raising the entry
barriers are likely easier once an occupation is established and has gained influence in a political
jurisdiction. States often enact grandfather clauses and ratchet up requirements that protect
existing workers and increase entry costs to new entrants. We analyze the labor market influence
of the duration of occupational licensing statutes for 13 major universally licensed occupations
over a 75-year period. These occupations comprise the vast majority of workers in these regulated
occupations in the United States. We provide among the first estimates of potential economic
rents to grandfathering. We find that duration years of occupational licensure are positively
associated with wages for continuing and grandfathered workers. The estimates show a positive
relationship of duration with hours worked, but we find moderately negative results for
participation in the labor market. The universally licensed occupations, however, exhibit
heterogeneity in outcomes. Consequently, unlike some other labor market public policies, such as
minimum wages or direct unemployment insurance benefits, occupational licensing would likely
influence labor market outcomes when measured over a longer period of time.

Introduction
Occupational licensure is the legal process by which governments (mostly the U.S. states
but also local governments and the federal government) identify the qualifications that are
required to practice a trade or profession, after which time only licensed practitioners are allowed
by law to receive pay for doing the work in the occupation. This form of labor market regulation
has rapidly become one of the most significant institutional factors affecting labor markets in the
United States and other industrialized countries (Kleiner, 2015). Over the past several decades,
the share of U.S. workers holding an occupational license has grown sharply. For example,
during the 2012–2013 state legislative sessions, at least seven new occupations were licensed in
at least one state—occupations ranging from scrap metal recyclers in Louisiana to body artists in
the District of Columbia. 1 U.S. government estimates suggest that over 1,100 occupations are
regulated to some extent in at least one state, but fewer than 60 are regulated in all 50 states,
showing substantial differences in which occupations states choose to regulate (Department of
the Treasury Office of Economic Policy, Council of Economic Advisers, and Department of
Labor, 2015).
The time from the implementation of occupational licensing laws may be important in
analyzing regulation’s influence on the labor market. One rationale is that states often enact
grandfather clauses that protect existing workers by allowing them to practice either when
licensing laws are passed or after the enactment of new regulations, even though they may not
meet the current requirements. We provide among the first estimates of the labor market returns
to grandfathering. In contrast, new entrants must have higher entry standards than the existing

members of the occupation. 2 We, therefore, anticipate that individuals who are grandfathered
would have incentives to encourage licensing and their continued participation in the occupation
at pre-licensing levels of education and training. They would likely obtain economic rents by
limiting supply and increasing the demand for the higher quality service. 3 In the labor market,
the process of older, lesser trained workers leaving the workforce or moving to other occupations
and newer workers with higher entry requirements entering the field takes many years or even
decades as the process works its way through the labor market, resulting in potentially higher
wages. We examine duration over a 75-year period to determine the influence of occupational
licensing on key labor market outcomes.
In examining the influence of occupational licensing duration on the labor market, we
initially review the literature of duration effects on labor market outcomes and show that our
study is the first comprehensive examination of the issue using more than one occupation and
implements a substantially longer time period of analysis. More important, we also present
evidence that goes beyond analyzing wage determination to examine hours worked and
participation in the regulated occupation for large numbers of workers. Consistent with other
findings, we show that occupational licensing raises wages in the regulated occupations and that
the duration of state licenses also is associated with higher wages. We find this to be the case
across a number of robustness tests, and it is also the case for grandfathered workers. In addition,
the estimates show that the duration of state licensing is associated with an increase in yearly
hours worked by those in the occupation by almost 2 percent, but that participation in the

A model of grandfathering presented by Shavell (2007) assumes that if the best standard in period 1 exceeds the
level of risk that would be appropriate for the expected harm, grandfathering may be desirable. If in period 2 the
known harm is below a threshold, grandfathering is optimal—parties who engaged in the activity in period 1 can
maintain their period 1 level of risk in period 2, but parties who enter the activity in period 2 should take the new
conventionally optimal precaution for the known harm, and they have certainty of the outcome in the second period.

occupation in the labor market declines somewhat over the first 30 years after the licensing laws
are implemented. However, the labor market outcomes for the occupations we examine exhibit
heterogeneity. We implement several sensitivity tests to examine the robustness of our estimates
for labor market outcomes. These results are largely consistent with a monopoly model of
regulation that shows gains to those in the regulated occupation through higher wages and more
hours worked, but which may restrict entrants into the occupation in the long run.
Reviewing Duration in the Labor Market for Licensed Occupations
The duration of occupational statutes has been identified in previous studies as a factor
that may raise wages (Law and Marks, 2009, Timmons and Thorton, 2013). In both studies, the
authors examined one occupation and focused on wage determination. Our study expands on
these studies by examining 13 universally licensed occupations (i.e., licensed in all states), some
of which have been regulated in all states for over 100 years and others that just became
universally licensed during the past decade. The number of workers in these occupations
represents about 60 percent of all universally licensed workers in the United States in 2013 from
our estimates using the American Community Survey (ACS). These occupations were chosen
because the date of initial licensure was available, there were sufficient observations in the
census for statistical analysis, and that the vast majority of workers must obtain a license in order
to work (Gittleman and Kleiner, 2016). Also, the states that licensed these occupations regulated
them at different times, allowing for a difference-in-differences estimation strategy.
The Growth and Wage Effects of Occupational Licensing
Occupational licensing has grown to be one of the largest institutions in the U.S. labor
market (Kleiner and Krueger, 2013). To illustrate, funeral attendants are licensed in nine states
and florists in only one state. Estimates from national surveys find that the wages of unlicensed
4

workers are 8 to 15 percent lower than those of licensed workers with similar levels of education,
training, and experience (Kleiner, 2006, Kleiner and Krueger, 2013, Gittleman, Klee, and
Kleiner, forthcoming). At the upper end, Kleiner and Krueger (2013) find that licensing at the
state level confers a wage premium of around 17 percent, and the combination of state and either
federal or local licensing has an estimated impact of around 25 percent. Local licenses by
themselves are not associated with higher wages, and certification has a smaller effect on wages
using estimates from data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (Gittleman,
Klee, and Kleiner, forthcoming).
Unlike the minimum wage or unemployment insurance which requires all employers that
are covered by the law to pay the new wage or transfer payment immediately, occupational
licensing allows individuals who are working in the occupation, but do not meet the current
licensing requirements, to continue working. This practice is called “grandfathering.” In
addition, the regulated occupation generally has the ability to ratchet up the requirements—that
is, raise the requirements for initial entry or movement into the occupation from other political
jurisdictions with minimal constraints from policy makers (Wheelan, 1999). Again, individuals
who do not meet the current requirements are allowed to keep working with permission from the
government. In our analysis, we examine how time from initial licensure, which we call duration,
influences key labor market outcomes such as wages, hours worked, and participation in the
workforce.
The Role of Different Institutions on Wage Determination and Labor Market Outcomes
A helpful analogy of the influence of institutions in the labor market can be drawn from
unions. When unions first organize a firm or establishment, the wage increases are generally
small (Freeman and Kleiner, 1990, DiNardo and Lee, 2004, Lee and Mas, 2012). However,

5

cross-sectional estimates of the impact of unions are between 15 to 20 percent (Hirsch and
Macpherson, 2013). The additional cost of having a union worker is approximately $40,500 over
the course of that worker’s employment with the firm (Lee and Mas, 2012). Moreover, unions
appear to raise the wages and benefits with a statistically significant effect the longer they are in
an establishment (Freeman and Kleiner, 1990). We examine whether these wage outcomes may
also be the case for occupational licensing.
Unions may raise wages through collective bargaining and withholding their labor
services through concerted activities to gain wages and benefits. On the other hand, occupational
licensing could raise wages by choosing the right set of regulations to restrict supply and limit
the tasks of unlicensed workers, and thus enhance demand by signaling and education that they
are providing a higher quality service (Friedman, 1962, Spence, 1973). In a manner similar to
unions, the institutional mechanism and design that occupational licensing uses also takes time to
implement and the full effects may only reach fruition over several decades of strengthening
these rules (Hurwicz, 1973).
Background on Grandfathering and Ratcheting Requirements
Initially, the influence of licensing duration on labor market outcomes was identified in a
National Bureau of Economic Research volume published in 1945 by Milton Friedman and
Simon Kuznets (Friedman and Kuznets, 1945). They noted that in 1911, the American Medical
Association, through the implementation of the Flexner Report, ratcheted up requirements for
becoming a doctor through tougher admissions requirements, length of education in medical
school, and limits on the number of new openings for medical education (Beck, 2004). While
increasing the requirements for graduation from medical school and pushing for tougher
licensing, the Flexner Report did not require currently working doctors to meet the same higher

6

requirements; this was a classic case of grandfathering (Beck, 2004). Friedman and Kuznets
went on to examine the influence of the regulations more than 20 years later in the late 1930s,
and they found that doctors were able to raise their wages by 17 percent more than dentists, who
did not substantially change their requirements. This example illustrates how an occupation can
raise wages that involved rents to those who were in the occupation and how entry requirements
for an occupation were raised for just new entrants.
More recent estimates of the influence of the length of licensing statutes on wage
determination include results for massage therapists, nurses, lawyers, and barbers (Law and
Marks, 2009, Pagliero, 2010, Timmons and Thornton, 2010, Timmons and Thornton, 2013). The
main results suggest that for specific occupations such as massage therapists and barbers, the
length of time that a licensing statute has been in place enhances the earnings of these
practitioners, but little evidence of the influence of duration was found for nurses (Law and
Marks, 2013). However, the estimates are limited to these occupations over a relatively short
time period. Our estimates expand upon and provide evidence beyond simply the wage
determination effects of licensing duration on labor market outcomes.
Although not explicitly addressed, the process occurs by allowing current practitioners to
avoid the explicit general and specific education requirements, internships, tests, continuing
education mandates, and good moral character investigations, assuming that they were in good
standing prior to the new licensing laws. To the extent that these requirements raise marginal
productivity, they may also raise wages. Also, it takes many years for the individuals who did
not meet these requirements to leave the occupation or retire, and as a result, the educational
quality of the new entrants is higher, and they dominate the current members of the occupation
only after a substantial period of time. Moreover, the longer the occupation is licensed, the
7

greater the ability of the members of the occupation to lobby the legislature and licensing boards
to ratchet up requirements for entry within the occupation for those who might enter from
unregulated states or occupations. For example, accountants increased the years of university
schooling from four to five years in the 1990s in order to attain a Certified Public Accountant
(CPA) license (Carpenter and Stephenson, 2006). In addition, physical therapists raised their
education requirements from a bachelor’s degree in the 1990s to a doctor of physical therapy
license by 2016 through 2018 (Cai and Kleiner, 2016). In both cases, the national professional
association promoted these enhanced or ratcheted-up requirements through the state boards of
licensing or the state legislature. Although the policies may have enhanced the educational
quality of the new workers, they could have also reduced access to the occupation by
practitioners and consumers and limited the supply of labor to the occupation.
A Licensing Model with Duration
The model uses a framework in which the work of one occupation or individual cannot
legally be done without the inputs of the other occupation. The focus of the model serves as a
basis to inform and develop hypotheses about the empirical work, rather than as a fully specified
general equilibrium model of production of services under regulation. The model uses a modified
standard production function:
𝑄𝑄𝑡𝑡𝐿𝐿 = f(P(z), K)t

(1)

𝑄𝑄𝑡𝑡𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈 = f(P(z), N(z), K)t,

(2)

where 𝑄𝑄𝑡𝑡𝐿𝐿 is the output produced by the licensed practitioner over time t, which we will refer to

as “high-skilled services.” 𝑄𝑄𝑡𝑡𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈 is the output produced by the unlicensed worker (UL) over time t,
which we will refer to as “low-skilled services.” P(z) represents the licensed worker’s labor,
recognizing that output relies on their decision of personal input, and N(z) represents the UL’s
8

labor, recognizing that output relies on the worker’s decision of personal input. The variable K
represents the quantities of capital inputs used in a service production function (Reinhardt, 1972).
By law, however, the technology needed for ULs to produce 𝑄𝑄𝑡𝑡𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈 is tied to supervision of

entry by the licensed practitioner. Nevertheless, within a profit function, the UL’s wage is tied to
the decisions of the licensed practitioner to add the labor input and technology mix to the highskilled provider, 𝑄𝑄𝑡𝑡𝐿𝐿 . Regulation acts like a shifter of both the supply and demand curves with

long time lags for full implementation over time t because of grandfathering and the ratcheting
up of skills for regulated practitioners. In the model, time is the proxy for grandfathering licensed

workers and capturing the work of unregulated or lesser regulated practitioners. For example, a
licensed engineer or architect can restrict the work of an unlicensed interior designer, reducing
earnings, hours worked, or the number of workers who may choose that occupation over time
(Kleiner, 2013). Regulated practitioners, who are generally in control of the production of these
services, can allocate relatively low-skilled work to unlicensed workers while taking on higherskilled and value-added services for themselves and thus increasing their hours worked and
earnings, but still restricting the number of workers who may enter the occupation. These central
theoretical issues raised in these models are empirical questions that the rest of the paper
examines.
The Rationale for Grandfathering and Ratcheting
In the labor market, the process of older, lesser trained workers leaving the workforce or
moving to other occupations and newer workers with higher entry requirements entering the field
takes many years or decades as the process works its way through the labor market, resulting in
potentially higher wages. An illustration of the process over three periods is shown in Appendix
Figure 1. The figure shows the evolution of grandfathered participants over time and how they

9

diminish by leaving the occupation, through occupational mobility, retirement, or death. By the
end of the period, only individuals who have gone through the licensing process are in the
occupation. However, the process may limit the supply of labor in the long run by increasing
entry and mobility requirements, and may allow those licensed in the occupation to gain
economic benefits by limiting employment growth. In addition, occupations could also ratchet up
the requirements for already licensed occupations. Therefore, licensing duration—the time from
the implementation of occupational licensing legislation—may matter. It may take years for the
full effects of occupational licensing to be realized in the labor market, and for the analyst to
observe these changes on wages, hours, and employment. A similar effect of regulation would
occur when the occupation ratchets up the requirements for entry, such as the increases in
education that occurred in accounting and physical therapy.
A further implication of the role of time for occupational licensing is that it captures the
work of unregulated workers and tasks as exemplified in the North Carolina State Board of
Dental Examiners v. Federal Trade Commission Supreme Court case (2015). Moreover, legal
cases involving the Institute for Justice challenged cosmetologists capturing the work of hair
braiding for their occupation. In addition, veterinarians have tried to legally capture the work of
farmhands who do teeth filing for horses, suggesting that only trained veterinarians can do these
tasks for farm animals. In all of these cases, the number of hours provided in the regulated
occupations would grow as unlicensed workers declined and as the tasks were legally mandated
by regulated workers, as presented in our theory overview.
The Empirical Model
We gathered statutory information for each occupation by year for each state that passed
a licensure law from several different legal data sources. In order to calculate the duration of
10

licensure for all states, we used a couple of different resources. Our major source of data used a
Council of State Governments (1952) report to obtain information by year for each state listing
their first licensing legislation for the major universally licensed occupations in our analysis.
From this source alone, we were able to obtain 60 percent of the required statutory data for the
thirteen universally licensed occupations. We also used the LexisNexis legal resource database to
obtain the remaining statutory information. 4
In order to develop a model with a sufficient time line to analyze how duration may
influence labor market outcomes, we use all available data from the census and the American
Community Survey (ACS) for a 75-year time period from 1940 to 2015 (Meyer and Osborne,
2005). We begin with 1940 since that was the first year wage data was added to the census. We
include in our sample individuals who worked in 13 major universally licensed occupations that
had more than 152 million workers over time, and which represented more than 10 percent of the
U.S. workforce and about 60 percent of all individuals in universally licensed occupations. The
sample includes both blue and white-collar occupations and ones that are high, middle, and low
income. We limit the analysis to those 13 universally licensed occupations that have sufficient
number of state and year observations in the census and were licensed in all states by 2015, the
end of our period of analysis.
Figure 1 presents a timeline of state licensures for all occupations under analysis. The
sample includes individuals who were either in one of the major universally licensed occupations
when it became regulated or in one of the unlicensed occupations during the period. Our analysis
4
For the additional remaining information on attorneys for 19 states, we contacted the Supreme Court library and
Board of Examiners. We managed to obtain responses for 7 states: Arkansas, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland,
Michigan, and Minnesota. We replaced the average duration with missing values on attorneys for 12 states:
Connecticut, Georgia, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, South
Carolina, Utah, and West Virginia, and we denoted with dummy variables in our statistical analysis for
completeness (Little and Rubin, 1987).

11

is limited because we can only include individuals who are covered by licensing statutes, but
some may not have attained a license (Gittleman and Kleiner, 2016). Also, we cannot cover the
same individuals over their careers as we can with smaller data sets such as the National
Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). However, we define the appropriate treatment groups
and varied control groups as described in Table 1. We first define individuals who worked in 13
major licensed occupations as a treatment group, and individuals in occupations that were never
licensed throughout the period of analysis as the control group. As a robustness check, we
compare the licensed workers to workers in the 13 universally licensed occupations before they
were covered by the regulations.
Next, we include standard human capital variables from the census and for more recent
years from the ACS, such as gender, age, education, marital status, and potential experience. In
order to generate a reliable sample for our analysis, we dropped those individuals whose
education is “below 12th grade without a diploma” for dentists, lawyers, accountants, and
pharmacists. Also, we dropped those individual whose education level was “below high school
diploma” for nurses. For barbers, we screened for those with at most a high school diploma. In
addition, individuals older than 65 or younger than 23 and those with years of potential
experience below zero were also deleted. 5
In addition, hourly real earnings were determined by dividing the annual earnings
including profits and dividends from work, by annual hours worked, adjusted by the 2014
consumer price index (CPI). Annual hours worked were calculated by multiplying the usual
working hours by the number of weeks for the past 12 months. We restrict our sample to fulltime workers by eliminating those individuals who worked less than 30 hours a week and less
5

We also used individuals with graduate school education for dentists, lawyers, and physicians, and the results were
similar. These estimates are available from the authors.

12

than 48 weeks a year. Also, in addition to these restrictions, the original sample was trimmed by
excluding individuals with real hourly wages below the federal minimum wage level in that year
and real hourly wages above $450. The resulting sample consists of 840 million observations
from 1940 to 2015 using the census and the ACS sample. 6 In Table 2 we show the means and
standard deviations of the individuals in the 13 universally licensed occupations with different
licensure statute conditions, and individuals in never licensed occupations 7 in our sample with
wage data normalized by the 2014 CPI. 8 In addition, we show in Table 3 descriptive statistics for
each licensed and unlicensed worker in the occupations that changed their licensing status during
the period of our analysis.
Implementing Descriptive and Causal Estimates
The following sections present both descriptive and causal estimates of our empirical
models, initially by using a kernel estimation approach for a descriptive approach and then by
using a difference-in-differences causal model that takes into account the different times that
each of the occupations in our model initially became licensed in each of the 50 U.S. states over
the time period of the analysis.
Nonparametric Kernel Estimation

6

We show the number of observations by year in Appendix Table 1.
We manually determine whether each occupation was ever licensed by verifying licensing status through the
variable occ1990. For the 1940 census data which lacks the occ1990 variable, we made a crosswalk between
occ1990 and occ1950. Data are weighted using population weights.
8
As more descriptive information about the data, Appendix Table 2 shows the summary statistics of hourly
wages and duration in licensed occupations split by year and regulation status. In addition, we show in
Appendix Table 4 descriptive statistics for workers in the universally licensed occupations split by median
duration. Appendix Table 3 shows the number of observations split by median duration and year. In Appendix
Table 5 we also include summary statistics of hourly wages and duration in licensed occupations split by
median duration and year.

13

In order to provide basic descriptive data for more recent and older licensed occupations,
we used a nonparametric kernel estimation procedure. The estimates for the effects of
occupational licensing duration on wages using the kernel estimation procedure are shown in
Figure 2. 9 The estimates are a form of data smoothing. We visually show whether the longer
duration of licensing exhibits wider variance in the earnings distribution.
We present the wage distribution changes after licensing legislation is enacted. The solid
line represents the wage distribution for unlicensed workers in occupations that were either in
one of the major universally licensed occupations when it became regulated or in one of the
unlicensed occupations during the period. In the figure we also show the effect of licensing
duration on the wage distributions for various time periods. The dashed line is the distribution for
licensed workers with a licensing duration of less than 10 years, the dotted line is the distribution
for licensed workers with a licensing duration of 11-30 years, the dash-dot line is the distribution
for licensed workers with a licensing duration of 31-50 years, and the dash-dot-dot line is the
distribution for licensed workers with a licensing duration of more than 50 years. Our
nonparametric kernel estimation results show that the wage distributions shift more to the right
the longer an occupation has been licensed, suggesting that it takes at least 30 years to fully
realize the economic effects of occupational licensing on wage determination. The long time
period for the full effect may reflect both the increased demand for the licensed service, the
ability to more fully limit supply, and the ability to ratchet up the requirements to attain a license.
Empirically Modeling Duration Effects

9

The kernel estimation procedure develops and uses an autoregressive approach to predict observed outcomes
and is a theoretical method to provide basic forecasts of observed phenomena.

14

In order to more fully empirically model the influence of occupational licensing on wage
determination, hours worked, and participation in the labor market, we use a basic difference-indifferences approach. Since states implemented their licensing statutes at different times, we are
able to develop an estimate of causal inference for the influence of duration on labor market
outcomes. We would expect the relationship to initially move slowly as newer licensed workers
enter and fewer grandfathered workers continue to work in the occupation. When grandfathered
workers retire or leave the occupation, wages would likely increase more rapidly. Furthermore,
wages would likely increase when workers’ representatives are more fully in control of the
supply of labor by ratcheting up requirements.
To causally link occupational licensing and labor market outcomes, we employ a
difference-in-differences (DID) strategy using data on changes to state licensing requirements for
the 13 universally licensed occupations in our sample. Such changes affect the ability of
individuals to work in a licensed occupation in a particular state without needing to fulfill
additional regulatory requirements. For estimation purposes, our model takes the following form:
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝜹𝜹𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽 + 𝜏𝜏𝑘𝑘 + 𝜂𝜂𝑠𝑠 + 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(3)

where 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the measure of log hourly wage or annual hours worked of individual i in state s in

census year t. 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is duration of the initial occupational licensing statute. We use two

definitions of this key variable to estimate linear and nonlinear duration effects: 1) years from the
start of state occupational licensing statute, 10 2) the eight dummies for duration to examine the

nonlinear duration effect: 0-3 years, 4-10 years, 11-20 years, 21-30 years, 31-40 years, 41-50
years, 51-100 years, and greater than or equal to 101 years. For example, the duration dummy for
10

Since we allow for a one-year lag to ensure the licensing statute was already enacted by the time
observation is measured, and both earnings and hours data are based on the previous calendar year, years
from the start of state occupational licensing statute are calculated as follows:
Durationist=(Year of the Datait-1)-(Year when licensing statute enactedist+1)
15

11-20 equals 1, and the remaining duration dummies equal 0 for individuals in occupations that
were licensed for 14 years in 2015. The variable 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is individual characteristics (years of
education, gender, race, potential experience, potential experience squared, and marital

status), 𝜏𝜏𝑘𝑘 includes the two- or three-digit 2010 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC)

fixed effects, 𝜂𝜂𝑠𝑠 includes state fixed effects, and 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 includes year fixed effects. The variable of

interest in this regression is 𝛿𝛿(s), the coefficient(s) on the licensing duration variable. We can

interpret 𝛿𝛿 as the DID estimate(s) of the effect of occupational licensing on log hourly wage or
annual hours worked relative to individuals in occupations that are unlicensed throughout our
period of analysis:
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝜹𝜹𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽 + 𝜂𝜂𝑠𝑠 + 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(4)

As an additional sensitivity check, we limit the analysis to the major universally licensed
occupations and estimate the model in equation (4). 𝛿𝛿 is the DID estimate of the licensing
duration effect of the universally licensed occupations relative to unlicensed occupations in the
universally licensed occupations prior to states passing licensing statutes. The other variables
have the same definitions as in equation (3).
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝜹𝜹𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽 + 𝛾𝛾𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜂𝜂𝑠𝑠 + 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(5)

In equation (5) we show our model of licensed worker participation in the workforce. The
variable 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 indicates whether person i works in a major universally licensed occupation in state

s in year t, and 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is per capita mean income in state 𝑠𝑠 in year 𝑡𝑡. The other variables

have the same definitions as in equation (3). We use the DID model by exploiting changes in
state licensing laws and requirements over time in each of the tables presented in the rest of the

Our sources of identification are the changers in states that adopted occupational
licensing laws over time relative to the non-adopters, individuals who were licensed in the same
occupation in comparison to those who did not achieve licensure coverage, and any individual
who was licensed relative to those who were not licensed. In order to focus only on changers
during the period of analysis, we develop separate estimates for occupations that were licensed
during the period 1940–2015. In order to focus on changers in licensing, we also examine by
discrete time periods the influence of becoming a licensed occupation on the participation rate in
the occupation (Law and Marks, 2013). However, we also present estimates of all 13 occupations
in our sample, many of which were initially regulated prior to 1940. 11 Moreover, since we do not
assume a linear relationship between licensing adoption and its labor market effects, we present
nonlinear estimates in our tables.
In Table 4 we show the influence of duration on wages using clustered standard errors at
the state-occupation level. We show both linear and nonlinear specifications in the table. In
addition, we show in panel A estimates using all the occupations in our sample. In panel B, we
show estimates for only those occupations that changed their licensing status over the period of
our analysis. In columns (4) and (6), we show the influence of the duration on wage
determination with 3-digit occupation controls as a benchmark for our other specifications. The
estimates in column (6) show that wage effects increase by 3 percent the first 3 years after
adoption, and then wage effects increase gradually to 20 percent for those individuals in
occupations that have been licensed for more than 100 years. In column (4), the estimates
suggest that for every 10 years that an occupation is licensed, wages increase by a statistically
significant 2 percent. Moreover, in column (2), we see that becoming licensed raises earnings by

almost 8 percent, which is at the lower range of estimates in much of the empirical literature on
the effects of licensing on wage determination (Kleiner and Krueger, 2010, Kleiner and Krueger,
2013, Gittleman, Klee and Kleiner, forthcoming).
As an additional sensitivity check, we present in columns (7), (8), and (9) the licensing
duration effects on hourly wage relative to hourly wage of unlicensed workers in the 13
universally licensed occupations prior to a state passing a licensing statute. The estimate in
column (8) suggests that for every 10 years that an occupation is licensed, wages increase by a
statistically significant 5 percent relative to the hourly wage of unlicensed workers in the 13
universally licensed occupations prior to the state passing a licensing statute. In column (9),
estimates show that hourly wages increase rapidly after 20 years from the implementation of the
licensing statutes, suggesting nonlinear duration effects of this form of regulation on hourly
wages.
As a robustness test of our estimates across various specifications or groups of
occupations, we found relatively small differences of the wage effects over time across the
specifications between older regulated occupations and those who were licensed more recently.
As a further test of the strength of our findings, we also utilized the coarsened exact matching
method in Iacus et al. (2012) with a DID methodology in order to remove the selection bias
caused by endogenous selection into the occupations. Specifically, we perform coarsened exact
matching on potential experience and marital status, and perform exact matching on race and
gender and found that the results are consistent and robust to those presented in Tables 4 and 5. 12
In Table 5 we present estimates of the influence of duration of occupational licensing on
hours worked per year using clustered standard errors at the state-occupation level. We expect
12

Difference in differences estimates combined with Coarsened Exact Matching are shown in Appendix Table
10 and we find consistent nonlinear duration effects on hourly wage and hours worked per year. In addition,
the detailed matching summaries are shown in Appendix Tables 8 and 9.

that if an occupation is able to restrict entry and the demand for services in the occupation is
constant or rising, then the incumbent workers will work more hours. Moreover, if the
substitution effect is greater than the income effect and wages grow through occupational
licensing, then we anticipate that workers in the regulated occupation will have an incentive to
work more hours.
Using an approach similar to the one shown in Table 4, in Table 5 we begin by
estimating the influence of duration with 3-digit occupation controls and linear and nonlinear
relationships on hours worked per year. We also show estimates of the two panels for all the
occupations in our sample and the ones that experienced changes, and find the results consistent
across different groups and specifications. We show in panel A estimates using all the
occupations in our sample. We find consistent nonlinear duration effects on hours worked per
year using two different control groups. In column (6), we find statistically insignificant
licensing effects for the first 3 years from the start of the licensing statute, but hours worked per
year start to increase rapidly after 4 years from the introduction of licensing statutes. Licensed
workers in occupations that have been licensed for 11-20 years work an extra 78 hours per year
compared to never licensed workers. After 40 years from licensing enactment, we find
insignificant licensing effects on hours per year. Also, we find in column (2) that becoming
licensed is associated with an extra 36 hours worked per year relative to hours worked per year
of those never licensed workers.
As a further sensitivity test, in columns (7), (8), and (9) we again limit the sample to the
13 universally licensed occupations and find the nonlinear positive duration effects on hours
relative to unlicensed workers in the 13 universally licensed occupations prior to their state
passing licensing statutes.
19

In panel B, we show the influence of becoming licensed using the occupations that were
regulated during the period of analysis. In column (2) in panel B, the estimates of increasing the
hours worked due to becoming licensed is more than 36 hours per year for those who were
licensed more recently relative to hours worked per year of never licensed workers. Also, the
estimates in columns (6) and (9) show the nonlinear duration effects on hours worked per year
across two different comparison groups, suggesting consistent results relative to those in panel
A. 13 The resulting increase in hours worked per year could be due to the substitution effect of
wage increases dominating the income effect for the occupations evaluated in our sample. Again,
we show the influence of becoming licensed using the occupations that were regulated during the
period of analysis and those who were licensed during earlier periods.
To further examine the influence of occupational licensing in the labor market, we also
provide basic approximations of the potential rents that occupational licensing offers to
individuals who are grandfathered to show the potential incentives for these individuals to
promote this type of regulation. To develop these estimates, we use those individuals whose
expected tenure in an occupation occurred during the period that the occupation initially became
licensed. To illustrate, if an occupational therapist had 10 years of experience and licensing
occurred after she had been in the occupation for 5 years, then that person would be considered
grandfathered. In this example, individuals with tenure less than 5 years would be considered to
have entered the occupation after licensing and would be a new entrant who started after the
initial regulation of the occupation. In Table 6, we show descriptive statistics for grandfathered

13

As an additional robustness check, we implemented a two-stage procedure that uses the state as the unit of
observation rather than individual characteristics (Hanushek, 1974; Amemiya, 1978; Conley and Taber, 2011).

20

workers and find that about 10 percent of individuals in the 13 universally licensed occupations
are grandfathered over the period we examine in our analysis.
In Tables 7 and 8, we show the DID estimates of influence of grandfathering on labor
market outcomes. We again show the influence of grandfathering using the occupations that
were regulated during the period of analysis, and those who were licensed during earlier periods.
The results in Table 7 show that individuals who are grandfathered gained 0.3-0.7 percent per
year in earnings, and their overall earnings are about 4 percent higher than their unlicensed
control groups. In terms of the grandfathering effects on hours worked per year, estimates in
Table 8 show that individuals who are grandfathered work 13-47 more hours than their
unlicensed control groups. We also find that duration is positively and nonlinearly associated
with hourly wage and hours worked per year. 14
In Table 9 we show the earnings effect of grandfathering relative to new entrants into the
occupation. In columns (3) and (4), we use ACS data from 2001 to 2015 to provide analysis of
grandfathered workers in occupations in states that recently enacted licensing statutes. In this
case, new entrants make about 26.9 percent more than grandfathered workers. However, using
Oaxaca decomposition analysis, human capital differences widen the wage gap to 28.4 percent
because new entrants require substantially higher human capital to obtain occupational licensure
(Oaxaca, 1973). But we also find that the unexplained portion—or the potential rents to
grandfathered workers—is able to explain about almost 2 percent in the wage gap in favor of

14

As a further robustness check, we employ the coarsened exact matching method in Iacus et al. (2012) with a
DID methodology in order to solve the common support problem and the selection bias problem. The
matching methodology pairs each grandfathered worker with an unlicensed worker in the comparison group
based on pre-treatment characteristics, so that the comparison group of workers have similar pre-treatment
characteristics as the grandfathered workers with whom they are paired. Specifically, we perform coarsened
exact matching on education, experience, and marital status, and perform exact matching on race and gender.
The results of these estimates are shown in Appendix Table 11.

21

grandfathered workers. Therefore, occupational licensing offers potential rents to individuals
who are grandfathered into occupational licensing relative to unlicensed workers or new licensed
entrants with similar observable covariates.
To the extent that an increase in hours worked could reflect a reduction in the number of
practitioners, we next turn our attention to Table 10, which focuses on labor market participation
of licensed workers. Perhaps one of the most speculated about yet little researched areas of
occupational licensing is the role of this regulated institution on the labor supply of regulated
practitioners (Law and Marks, 2013). In Table 10 we estimate the influence of the duration of an
occupational license statute on labor market participation in universally licensed occupations,
using different methods of categorizing the occupations in our sample. Unlike our previous
analysis, we now include in our sample all individuals in the labor force in order to determine
whether licensing affected participation in universally licensed occupations relative to all other
occupations. In addition, we focus on the licensing effects on participation for individuals in
universally licensed occupations with duration less than 65 years relative to occupations with
duration greater than 65 years. Our estimates show the influence of the passage of the licensing
statute by 3-year intervals following the passage of the law. Throughout the first 30 years
following the passage of the statute, occupational licensing reduces labor force participation in
universally licensed occupations. Our results imply that the occupations that are most likely to be
licensed were regulated in an earlier period, and ratcheting up the requirements results in fewer
workers. These declines in the number of workers in universally licensed occupations may be the
reason for wages going up and the number of hours worked by practitioners increasing, as shown
by Tables 4 and 5. Consistent with the theoretical section, occupational licensing statutes can
provide the basis for regulated practitioners reallocating work toward members in their own

22

occupation at the expense of other workers in the occupation. An illustration of the issue is
provided in the case of North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners v. Federal Trade
Commission (2015). The result of these practices could be the higher observed pay.
Any DID-type strategy relies on the assumption that treatment and control groups do not
follow differential trends over time. In order to provide a further robustness check on the
estimates shown in Tables 4 and 5, in Figure 3 we show the slope of the hourly wage curve
before and after the change to licensure. Wages in the regulated occupations are relatively flat
before the introduction of licensing, but decrease slightly immediately following regulation.
Perhaps this is because of the surge in the number of people who want to enter the regulated
occupation and the hours worked of those in the licensed occupation now that licensing has been
introduced and lower-skilled grandfathered practitioners can continue to work, but the
regulations have little bite initially. After the start of initial regulation, hourly wages increase as
the duration of licensing grows, also perhaps because of workers who were grandfathered,
leaving the occupation and the ability of the representatives for the occupations to ratchet up the
legal requirements for entry. The statistically significant difference in slopes of the wage lines
before and after the change to licensure presented in Figure 3, along with the similarities between
the 13 universally licensed and never licensed groups shown in Tables 2 and 3, suggest that the
DID approach of identification has validity for our empirical model. 15
To further test the strength of our findings shown in Tables 4 and 5, we also check this
assumption by including leads and lags of changing requirements. Specifically, we add indicator
variables for 1-6 years before adoption, years 0-30 after adoption, and year 31 onward. Of these

15

The estimates in Figure 3 show only occupations that changed regulatory status over the period we examined from
1940 to 2015. We also charted all the individual occupations in our sample, and they showed similar plots; these
results are available from the authors.

23

38 indicator variables, we note that the first 37 are equal to 1 only in the respective year, while
the final variable is equal to 1 in each year following the 31st year after adoption.
Figures 4 and 5 plot estimated licensing effects on hourly wage and annual hours by
including the leads and lags of changing the requirements. In panel A for each figure, we
estimate the licensing effects of individuals in the universally licensed occupations relative to the
labor market outcome of individuals in never licensed occupations at yearly intervals in the six
years prior through the more than 30 years following the adoption of a licensing requirement.
Using an approach similar to that in panel A, panel B shows the licensing effects of licensed
individuals in universally licensed occupations relative to the labor market outcome of
unlicensed workers in the universally licensed occupations prior to states passing licensing
statutes. Overall, Figures 4 and 5 suggest that occupational licensing does affect hourly wage and
annual hours worked. 16
Occupations can have different market and institutional reasons for varying wage effects.
For example, dentists usually control the dental licensing boards that determine job requirements
for their occupation and auxiliary occupations such as hygienists and assistants. Other
occupations such as occupational therapists are under the control of or are dominated by boards
of physical therapy and are less able to restrict entry into their occupation. Moreover, physicians
have long been licensed and have considerable market power as well as the advantage of having
convinced the public and lawmakers of the potential adverse consequences of missed diagnoses
and public health effects. In this way, they are able to limit entry and obtain long-run economic
benefits (Ketel, et al., 2016). In Figures 6 and 7 we show estimates for a wide variety of
occupations using the various control groups, each of which may have experienced different

Similar analysis for occupations that changed their regulation status are shown in Appendix Figures 2 and 3.

economic and institutional environments on the road to becoming licensed. In each figure, panel
A represents average duration effects for each occupation, and panel B represents heterogeneous
licensure effects over different occupations. 17 Considered together, Figures 6 and 7 suggest that
wages are generally similar but that dentists, for example, have much higher wages and lower
hours worked as a consequence of occupational licensing.
From a policy perspective, our estimates are consistent with the decision of the U.S.
Supreme Court in holding that dentists were operating as monopolists in reallocating tasks to
themselves when the North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners outlawed the work of
“teeth whiteners” (North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners v. Federal Trade
Commission, 2015). Our results suggest that occupational licensing works slowly over time as
older, less skilled workers retire or move to other occupations and the state boards or legislatures
that regulate the professions ratchet up the requirements for entry. Our ability to begin to
document these changes shows how important labor market institutions work with deliberate
speed to enhance the work and pay arrangements for their members, in contrast to policies such
as the minimum wage or changes in unemployment insurance policies, whose influence is more
immediate (Kleiner, 2015).
Conclusions
Since the implementation of new occupational licensing statutes takes time to fully carry
out, duration of occupational statutes should matter in influencing labor market outcomes. For
example, states often enact grandfather clauses that allow continuing practitioners to continue
working without meeting the new requirements, or they ratchet up the requirements for entry,
such as education and reciprocity agreements with other states or nations, that protect existing

workers. One implication is that new entrants must have higher regulatory standards than those
already in the occupation. The process of older, less educated workers leaving and newer
workers with higher entry requirements entering the occupation takes time to work its way
through the labor market. Our analysis uses a model in which licensed practitioners influence the
number and kinds of jobs that they and unregulated workers can do over the long run. We use
data for 13 large, diverse licensed occupations covering a 75-year period to examine the labor
market effects of initial licensure. Consistent with a theory of regulation, our results show that
grandfathered workers’ wages rise relative to unlicensed individuals’ wages in our two control
groups. Moreover, there are incentives for incumbents in the occupation to raise standards
because they can get higher wages. However, the relative number of workers in the occupation
declines somewhat. Our study should allow policy analysts and policy makers to develop and
implement more informed decisions on the long-run implications of the rapidly growing labor
market institution of occupational licensing.

Note: Slopes of the lines are statistically different after the implementation of a licensing statute. We
plot the wage lines before and after the licensing legislation for (a) occupations that changed licensing
status and (b) occupations that were never licensed. For (a), we fit two linear wage lines, before and
after licensing legislation, over the mean log hourly wages across duration of our 8 occupations that
changed licensing status. For (b), we again fit over mean log hourly wages across duration as before,
but now we consider the wages over duration of never licensed workers with respect to various years
of licensure per state for occupations in (a). Specifically, for each occupation in (a), we map the state
and year of first licensure information onto the never licensed workers and calculate occupational
licensing durations for each wage observation. Next, we take these 8 matched copies of never licensed
worker observations with different duration bases and calculate the mean of log hourly wages grouped
by duration. Finally, we fit the expanded data for never licensed workers into two linear lines for the
before and after licensing legislation.

Sample Construction II

Licensed workers in the 13
universally licensed occupations
between 1940 and 2015: architects,
accountants, barbers, cosmetologists,
dentists, occupational therapists,
physical therapists, practical nurses,
registered nurses, pharmacists,
physicians, lawyers, and teachers

Unlicensed workers in the same
occupations as the treatment group:
architects, accountants, barbers,
cosmetologists, dentists, occupational
therapists, physical therapists,
practical nurses, registered nurses,
pharmacists, physicians, lawyers, and
teachers prior to their becoming
licensed

Sample Construction III1

Workers in occupations licensed by
the states between 1940 and 2015:
architects, accountants, barbers,
occupational therapists, physical
therapists, practical nurses, registered
nurses, and teachers
Licensed workers in occupations that
were licensed between 1940 and
2015: architects, accountants, barbers,
occupational therapists, physical
therapists, practical nurses, registered
nurses, and teachers

Workers in occupations that were
never licensed during the period
1940-2015

Sample Construction IV2

Unlicensed workers in the same
occupations as the treatment group:
architects, accountants, barbers,
occupational therapists, physical
therapists, practical nurses, registered
nurses, and teachers prior to their
becoming licensed

Note: 1. Sample construction III drops the universally licensed occupations that did not change regulation
status throughout our period of analysis and compares individuals in the 8 universally licensed
occupations that changed regulation status with individuals in never licensed occupations.
2. Sample construction IV drops the universally licensed occupations that did not change regulation status
throughout our period of analysis and compares individuals in the 8 universally licensed occupations that
changed regulation status with individuals in the 8 universally licensed occupations prior to states passing
licensing statutes.

Note: The 13 universally licensed occupations include architects, accountants, barbers, cosmetologists, dentists,
occupational therapists, physical therapists, practical nurses, physicians, pharmacists, registered nurses,
lawyers, and teachers. We manually determine whether each occupation was ever licensed by verifying
licensing status through the variable occ1990. For the 1940 census data which lacks the occ1990 variable, we
made a crosswalk between occ1990 and occ1950. Data are weighted using population weights.

Note: The 13 universally licensed occupations include architects, accountants, barbers, cosmetologists, dentists,
occupational therapists, physical therapists, practical nurses, physicians, pharmacists, registered nurses,
lawyers, and teachers. We manually determine whether each occupation was ever licensed by verifying
licensing status through the variable occ1990. For the 1940 census data which lacks the occ1990 variable, we
made a crosswalk between occ1990 and occ1950. Data are weighted using population weights.

Note: Occupations that changed their regulation status include architects, accountants, barbers, occupational
therapists, physical therapists, practical nurses, registered nurses, and teachers. Occupations that did not
change their regulations status include cosmetologists, dentists, physicians, pharmacists, and lawyers. We
manually determine whether each occupation was ever licensed by verifying licensing status through the
variable occ1990. For the 1940 census data which lacks the occ1990 variable, we made a crosswalk between
occ1990 and occ1950. Data are weighted using population weights.

Note: The 13 universally licensed occupations include architects, accountants, barbers, cosmetologists, dentists, occupational
therapists, physical therapists, practical nurses, physicians, pharmacists, registered nurses, lawyers, and teachers. We manually
determine whether each occupation was ever licensed by verifying licensing status through the variable occ1990. For the 1940
census data which lacks the occ1990 variable, we made a crosswalk between occ1990 and occ1950. Data are weighted using
population weights.

Note: All models perform coarsened exact matching on experience and marital status, and perform exact matching on race (white vs. others) and gender. Since
some imbalances may still exist because we used only a few variables in the exact matching, we try to adjust for the remaining imbalances by controlling for
actual values of the covariates in a regression.; *** significant at the 0.01 level; ** significant at the 0.05 level; * significant at the 0.1 level; standard errors are
constructed using the heteroscedasticity robust covariance matrix that allows for clustering at the state-occupation level.
