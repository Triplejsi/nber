ABSTRACT
One of the most important outstanding questions in fundraising is whether donor premiums, or
gifts to prospective donors, are effective in increasing donations. Donors may be motivated by
reciprocity, making premium recipients more likely to donate and give larger donations. Or
donors may dislike premiums, preferring instead to maximize the value of their donations to the
charity; in this case donor premiums would be ineffective. We conduct a field experiment in
conjunction with the fundraising campaign of a major university to examine these questions.
Treatments include a control, an unconditional premium with two gift quality levels, and a set of
conditional premium treatments.
The conditional treatments include opt-out and opt-in
conditions to test whether donors prefer to forego premiums. Compared with the control, donors
are twice as likely to give when they receive an unconditional, high-quality gift. The low-quality
unconditional and all conditional premiums have little impact on the likelihood or level of giving.
Donors do not respond negatively to premiums: rates of giving do not suffer when premiums are
offered. In addition, few opt out given the opportunity to do so, indicating that they like gifts,
and suggesting that reciprocity rather than altruism determines the impact of premiums on giving.

Introduction

Donor premiums - gifts from a charity to a potential donor - are one of the most popular fundraising tools used to induce donors to give: Sixty percent of solicitations
involve some form of donor premium (Koop, 2005), with two general approaches.
Front-end unconditional gifts, such as address labels, are included with the solicitation, irrespective of a donation. Back-end conditional gifts are sent only in response
to a donation. For a premium to be effective, donors must respond positively. This
may be a result of the gift inducing a desire or obligation to reciprocate, or because
the premium itself enhances the reputation of the donor by signaling that they are a
supporter of the charity, thereby enhancing their social image (Benabou and Tirole,
2006; Lacetera and Macis, 2010b). Sending a gift may also serve as a signal of the
quality of the organization, thereby increasing donations. But donor premiums can
also backfire. Donors may react negatively if they disapprove of the premium as an
unnecessary fundraising expense, or if the “incentive” inherent in the provision of
premiums crowds out the inherent motive to donate (Gneezy et al., 2014; Lacetera
and Macis, 2010a; Newman and Shen, 2012).1 Even among practitioners, there is disagreement: some insist that “donors love premiums” (The NonProfit Times, 2013),
even as surveys show that nearly two-thirds of donors say “they do not want to
receive token gifts of any kind so that as much of their gift as possible goes to the
purpose to which they gave” (Cygnus Applied Research, 2011).
We partner with the Association of Former Students (AFS) at Texas A&M University to conduct a natural field experiment during a regularly-scheduled directmail fundraising campaign. The treatments are designed to elicit the mechanisms
by which gift exchange might operate on potential donors. We vary whether the gift
is unconditional (included with the solicitation, irrespective of a donation) or conditional (sent only in response to a donation). Within the unconditional treatment, we
provide a subset of potential donors with a higher quality version of the same gift (a
leather vs plastic luggage tag). We selected a donor premium that is branded with

Other possible mechanisms include that the gift serves as a proxy for the charity’s quality, or
that donors dislike spending on fundraising (Gneezy et al., 2014; Meer, 2014).

the university ASF logo, and which is therefore a signal of support for the organization (see Appendix Figure A.1 for shots of the tags). The treatment groups are
designed to influence channels that impact both the extensive margin of whether or
not to make a gift, and the intensive margin of the size of the gift, conditional on
giving.
If donors are motivated by a sense of reciprocity that increases with the value of
the gift, then the higher-quality gift should yield more giving relative to the lowerquality gift, which in turn will be more effective than a baseline treatment with no
gift. On the other hand, if donors dislike overhead and fundraising expenditures, as
they often claim they do, the relationship should go in the opposite direction.2
If the mere offer of a donor premium engenders feelings of reciprocity equal to
those from having a gift actually in hand, then the conditional gift treatments should
show the same patterns of donative behavior as the unconditional treatments. However, a conditional premium may not have the same motivational effect as the unconditional reward: its tit-for-tat character may instead crowd out intrinsic motivation
to a greater extent than the unconditional premium. Thus donors may have a smaller
response to conditional gifts.
To further investigate donor motives, we conduct two further treatments giving
donors the option to opt out from (or, symmetrically, opt in to) receiving the conditional gift. If donors are altruistically motivated to maximize the impact of their
donations by avoiding fundraising costs, they should decline the gift to preserve the
charity’s resources. In addition, declining the gift can reduce social pressure to give
a larger amount. On the other hand the response to conditional premiums may be
high and produce a high rate of donations, along with a number of small, “token”
donations, if donors want the item for its signaling or direct consumption value.
Prior research has investigated the effects of unconditional gifts in charitable
giving. Falk (2007) mailed a solicitation including zero, one, or four postcards to
previous donors of a children’s aid charity, finding a slightly higher giving rate for the

are alumni of Texas A&M University and are familiar with AFS, which serves both as the alumni
organization and the fundraiser for the annual fund.

small gift over the baseline and much higher rate for the large gift. This intervention
is highly profitable for the organization. Alpizar et al. (2008) offer a small gift during
an in-person solicitation in a national park; they find a higher giving rate but a lower
amount given. The result is driven by individuals in treatments without anonymity
during the giving process, suggesting that social pressure may play a large role in
gift exchange in this context; the treatment is not cost-effective. These experiments
do not, however, directly compare unconditional and conditional gifts, with their
potentially differing mechanisms. In the experiment most similar to ours, Landry et
al. (2011) conduct door-to-door solicitations with small and large gifts (a bookmark
and a book), given unconditionally, conditionally for any gift, or conditional on a
donation commensurate to the gift’s value. They show that while the unconditional
treatments produce higher rates of giving, their proceeds do not cover their costs.
Importantly, they find in follow-up solicitations that making the gift conditional
“served as an effective screen of those who were truly interested in giving.”
Our approach differs in that we conduct a direct-mail experiment, in which social
pressure to give in response to an unconditional gift is likely to be much lower relative
to a door-to-door solicitation. We also enhance the comparability of the large and
small gift by varying the quality of an identical item. Most importantly, we offer
donors the explicit option to decline (or, for completeness, require them to explicitly
accept) the conditional gift. This innovation, which, to our knowledge, has not yet
been examined in the literature, allows us to more thoroughly understand donors’
motivations for responding to the charity’s gift.
We find that the high-quality unconditional gift produces the highest giving rate,
though this response is far from sufficient to cover the costs of the solicitation. There
are no significant differences across the giving rates in the other treatments; all are
indistinguishable from the baseline. Donors overwhelmingly preferred receiving the
gift when offered the option - that is, they do not appear, for the most part, to be
driven to maximize the charity’s funds. There are no discernable effects on the size
of the gift, conditional on giving, though this is unsurprising given the structure of
AFS’s appeals.3

Experimental Design

We conducted a field experiment in partnership with the Association of Former
Students at Texas A&M University in early 2014. We began in late January with
225,474 alumni who had not donated the prior year or were within the first few years
after graduation. At AFS’s request, we “sequestered” 84,832 members of the sample
from the experiment in order to allow AFS’s phone bank to continue to operate;
these individuals were randomly chosen from the pool of alumni with a known phone
number. The remaining 140,642 were randomly assigned to seven treatment groups,
balanced on year of graduation, gender, residence in Texas, and giving segment (nondonor, recently lapsed, and “distant lapsed,” those whose last gift was more than
five years prior). Table 1 shows the balance in observables across treatments: control
(no gift); unconditional gift of a leather AFS-branded luggage tag; unconditional gift
of a plastic AFS-branded luggage tag; conditional gift of a plastic luggage tag (the
quality of the tag was not specified in the letter) with text on the envelope noting
a “special offer” conditional gift without the envelope text; conditional gift with an
opt-out option; and conditional gift with an opt-in option. Each leather luggage tag
cost $3.59, as compared to $0.74 for the plastic luggage tag.
Letters were sent in early March, and those with known phone numbers were
returned to the phone bank one month later. Other solicitations by mail began in
early May; all follow-up solicitations were orthogonal to our treatments. We record
gifts from March 10, 2014 to the end of our available data, November 10, 2014. We
made one adjustment to our initial sample. There were 895 individuals that gave
between our randomization and the mailing of our solicitations. We removed them,
leaving 139,747 in the sample that we use for the analysis.4 .
nation; over half the donations in our data are at this amount. As Harbaugh (1998) shows, and we
confirm in our data, donors tend to bunch at the bottom of giving levels, and the next suggested
level is $250. It is perhaps overly optimistic to expect that our treatments would cause donors to
more than double an already-substantial gift.
4
5,432 donors gave during our data collection period in response to mailings other than our
solicitations or through AFS’s web page or phone bank. These donors are included in the experimental population, but we include them as not having donated during our experiment. There is no
systematic pattern of giving for these donors (p=0.951). Non-experimental donations that occurred
during and after the experimental period are shown in Appendix Figure A.2.

As shown in the Appendix, the letters were identical across treatments with the
exception of the text regarding the gift. The conditional treatments also included
the text, “Look Inside for a Special Offer,” on the envelope, excepting the “no text”
treatment; removing the text made no appreciable difference to giving behavior.
Those in the control group received a standard solicitation letter, while the letter
to those in the unconditional gift treatments (leather or plastic luggage tag) included
the following paragraph:
As a token of appreciation for your Aggie pride, we are happy to enclose
a former student luggage tag. To make your gift today, please mail in
the attached gift form and mail it back in the included return envelope.
Those in the conditional gift treatments saw the following paragraph instead:
As a token of appreciation for your Aggie pride, we are happy to send
you a former student luggage tag in response to your gift. To make your
gift today, please mail in the attached gift form and mail it back in the
included return envelope.
The opt-in and opt-out options were listed in a prominent position at the top of
response form in those treatments.

Results

Table 2 summarized the results for the giving rate and dollars given. The median
gift is $100 in every treatment, and it is evident from the large standard deviations
that there are a number of large gifts. To reduce their influence, we also show means
winsorized at the 99th and 95th percentile of the giving distribution. There are no
significant differences in mean giving across treatments. Figure 1 shows that distributions of gift amounts for all treatments; there also are no significant differences in
these distributions (p=0.139).
The response rates are quite low in all treatments, though generally within the
typical range of rates from direct mail solicitations. However, the giving rate for
5

the unconditional leather treatment stands out as twice as large as the control (0.97
percent vs. 0.47 percent); the difference is statistically significant at p = 0.000. The
unconditional plastic treatment has a slightly higher giving rate than the control,
though it is not significant at conventional levels (p = 0.12); it is significantly lower
than giving in the higher-quality treatment (p = 0.000). These results suggest that a
sense of reciprocity drives giving, and donors are therefore more responsive to higherquality gifts. Further, despite claims to the contrary in other studies, donors are not
averse to fundraising costs in this particular context.
Turning to the conditional treatments, there is no difference among the four
(p = 0.312), nor between them and the control group (p = 0.463). However, the
conditional donation rate is lower than the unconditional rate (conditional vs. unconditional plastic, p=0.08; comparing the conditional donation rate across all treatments to the overall unconditional rate is significiant at p=0.000). It does seem that
the offer of a conditional gift does not have quite the same gift exchange effect as an
unconditional gift. It also appears that this offer does not reduce giving rates relative
to the baseline through crowding out of intrinsic motivation or distaste for overhead
costs. We also saw no indication of a greater prevalence of token donations in order
to receive the gift for a minimal expenditure. However, we cannot say whether social
norms preclude this behavior or that donors did not believe that the value of the gift
would exceed the cost of even a small donation plus the effort to mail it in.
Offering prospective donors the option to opt out of (or into) receiving the gift
did not have a significant impact on giving behavior. However, Table 3 and Figure
2a show that donors strongly preferred to receive the gift in both treatments. When
requiring an active decision to opt out, 88.3 percent chose to receive the gift, while
60.4 percent chose to do so when actively required to opt in; overall, three-quarters
of donors making a gift in this treatment elected to receive the luggage tag. This
provides evidence that donors are not motivated by the desire to maximize the impact
of their donation, which could be thought of as a more altruistic motivation. Rather,
the motivation appears to be, at least in part, a desire for the item itself, whether
for its direct value or the signaling value of an AFS-branded tag. Finally, Figure 2b
shows that contributions were higher on average for those who chose to receive the
6

tag in both treatments, this difference is not statistically significant.

Conclusion

We conduct a field experiment at a large state university to investigate the mechanisms underlying gift exchange in philanthropy. We find that donors are responsive to
unconditional gifts, particularly higher-quality ones. This suggests that reciprocity
plays a role and that donors are not overly concerned with fundraising expenditures
in this context. Despite the higher giving rate in the unconditional leather tag treatment, the expense of shipping the item to all prospective donors swamped the higher
return, yielding a loss of nearly $3 per solicitation, compared to a net gain of $0.26 in
the baseline treatment. The unconditional plastic tag treatment, with its lower-cost
item, still lost $0.70 per solicitation.5
We further show that the promise of a gift through a conditional offer does not
have the same impact as a gift in hand. Yet conditional offers do not appear to reduce
donative behavior, either through distaste for fundraising costs or crowding out of
intrinsic motivation. Donors overwhelmingly prefer to receive the gift when offered
the option to decline it, providing evidence against purely altruistic motivations for
giving.

These approaches may still be profitable in the long run if the act of giving creates a habit
(Meer, 2013).
