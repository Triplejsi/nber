ABSTRACT
We quantify the effect of a significant technological innovation, shale oil development, on asset
prices. Using stock returns on major news announcement days allows us to link aggregate stock
price fluctuations to shale technology innovations. We exploit cross-sectional variation in
industry portfolio returns on days of major shale oil-related news announcements to construct a
shale mimicking portfolio. This portfolio can explain a significant amount of variation in
aggregate stock market returns, but only during the time period of shale oil development, which
begins in 2012. Our estimates imply that $3.5 trillion of the increase in aggregate U.S. equity
market capitalization since 2012 can be explained by this mimicking portfolio. Similar portfolios
based on major monetary policy announcements do not explain the positive market returns over
this period. We also show that exposure to shale oil technology has significant explanatory power
for the cross-section of employment growth rates of U.S. industries over this period.

Introduction

Technological innovations play a central role in many theoretical models of asset pricing.
However, standard empirical measures of technology shocks (e.g., Solow residuals) do not
appear to be large enough to explain observed movements in asset prices.1 We provide a new
approach to empirically measuring innovations in technology. We apply this approach to a
sequence of shocks occurring in a particular industry with profound aggregate implications:
oil. Technological innovations in shale oil development from 2012 to 2014 led to a near
doubling of oil production in the U.S. and a dramatic decline in global oil prices. We find
that our measure of these shale oil technology shocks explains a significant component of
cross-sectional and time series variation in both asset prices and employment growth during
this time period.2
Measuring the effect of a given technological innovation is empirically challenging. Typically, such innovations are difficult to observe, making it hard to trace out their impact on
stock prices or real economic outcomes. A particular technological development can have
diverging (often opposite) effects on different sectors of the economy. Our empirical framework uses the entire cross section of stock returns to extract innovations to latent state
variables not directly observable by the econometrician. We rely on the idea that sometimes
the arrival of relevant public news announcements is observable.3 Using the stock market
reaction to the news allows us to estimate the exposures of various assets to the underlying
1

Much of the debate in empirical asset pricing centers on the relative role of news about future cash flows in
explaining variation in aggregate asset prices, as opposed to news about discount rates. See, e.g. Bansal and
Yaron (2004), Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004), Hansen, Heaton and Li (2008), Cochrane (2011), Bansal,
Kiku, Shaliastovich and Yaron (2014), Greenwood and Shleifer (2014), Albuquerque, Eichenbaum and Rebelo
(2015), Baker, Bloom and Davis (2015), Greenwald, Lettau and Ludvigson (2014), and Campbell, Giglio,
Polk and Turley (2016), for a wide range of views on the relative roles of shocks to technology, preferences,
expectations, uncertainty/volatility, etc.
2
Our work fits into a large literature attempting to quantify the economic impact of oil shocks on the real
economy as well as asset prices, e.g. Hamilton (1983), Jones and Kaul (1996), Sadorsky (1999), Hamilton
(2003), Barsky and Kilian (2004), Blanchard and Gali (2007), Dvir and Rogoff (2009), Kilian (2009), Kilian
and Park (2009), Hamilton (2009), Bodenstein, Guerrieri and Kilian (2012), Ready (2016), and numerous
others. Hausman and Kellogg (2015) estimate the benefits of the shale gas revolution on consumers. Arezki,
Ramey and Sheng (2015) use large oil discoveries across countries to analyze the effect of news about future
productivity on economic activity. Since asset prices are forward looking, the stock market should capture
news about both short- and long-run productivity innovations (e.g., Beaudry and Portier (2006)).
3
Our approach to empirically identifying the economic effect of technological innovations is closely related
- and complementary - to recent work by Kogan, Papanikolaou, Seru and Stoffman (2012) linking news on
patented technologies to equity returns.

2

unobservable shocks. We use key events related to shale oil development to undertake three
empirical exercises designed to measure the effect of shale oil technological innovations on
the economy.4
We first test whether an industry’s exposure to shale oil technology development is linked
with its stock price performance over the time period when the sequence of shale technology
shocks unfolds. To identify an industry’s exposure to shale oil we measure how stock prices
change in response to the disclosure of a major breakthrough in shale oil extraction in the
summer of 2013. This event represents the largest shale oil discovery to date, amounting to a
35% increase in expected recoverable oil reserves from the second largest oil field in the world.
We trace out how different industries are affected by examining the cross-section of industry
returns on this day. We find that there is significant dispersion, and that an industry’s
announcement return is linked with its stock performance during the shale oil time period.
Specifically, a one standard deviation increase in an industry’s shale discovery announcement
return leads to a 4.0% higher average annual return. This relationship only exists during the
time period of shale oil development (from January 2012 to September 2015), and not during
earlier time periods.
In our second empirical exercise we estimate the total contribution of shale oil technology
to the aggregate U.S. stock market over time, by constructing a shale mimicking portfolio based on the exposures of different industries to the shale discovery shock. The shale
discovery announcement exposures can then be used to construct a factor-mimicking portfolio that tracks the unobservable innovations in shale technology over time.5 We use this
shale-mimicking portfolio to identify the component of aggregate market fluctuations that
can be attributed to shale technology shocks. Firms with high announcement returns receive
a greater weight in this portfolio; firms with lower returns receive less weight. The intuition
4

Our approach is related to several strands of asset pricing literature that focus on dates with significant
public announcements. Lamont and Frazzini (2007) and Savor and Wilson (2015) focus on corporate earnings;
others, such as Jones, Lamont and Lumsdaine (1998), Gürkaynak, Sack and Swanson (2005), and Savor and
Wilson (2013) focus on releases of macroeconomic news; a large literature studies Federal Reserve monetary
policy announcement days, e.g. Bernanke and Kuttner (2005), Savor and Wilson (2014), and Lucca and
Moench (2015).
5
The intuition for relying on cross-sectional variation to construct factor-mimicking portfolios goes back
at least to Fama (1976). The approach of using asset price fluctuations to track the empirical dynamics
of a hard-to-measure underlying economic variable is closely related to the economic tracking portfolios of
Lamont (2001).

3

behind this empirical design is that there is no single asset we can use to cleanly measure
innovations in shale development. However, the mimicking portfolio weights that are constructed using the slopes of the cross-sectional regressions allow us to synthetically create
such an asset, building on the classic approach of Fama and MacBeth (1973). These weights
are based on responses of industries’ stock returns to an exogenous unexpected positive innovation in shale oil technology. We use this portfolio as an asset-price proxy for the value of
shale oil development, and assess the explanatory power of this portfolio for market returns
over different time periods.
We find that exposure to the shale mimicking portfolio has strong explanatory power for
aggregate stock market returns from 2012 to Q3 2015 period. In total, based on the point
estimate of our regressions, shale oil development is responsible for $3.5 trillion of the increase
in stock market value during this time period. The standard errors of our estimates imply
that shale oil development is responsible for at least $1 trillion of the increase in the stock
market with 90% confidence.6 Furthermore, our shale exposure proxy has no explanatory
power in earlier time periods when shale oil production was virtually nonexistent.
Finally, we assess whether the economic impact of shale oil that we measure using asset
prices translates into meaningful effects on the real economy. To do this, we estimate whether
the cross-section of shale discovery announcement day returns contains information about
changes in industry employment. We show that the shale discovery announcement returns
have significant explanatory power for the cross-section of employment growth rates of U.S.
industries, indicating that the effect we identify operates through real economic channels.
In the aggregate, we estimate that during the shale oil period 4,600,000 (net) new jobs are
linked with the development of shale oil technology. This represents a 4.2% increase in the
number of jobs across the industries in our study, compared to the aggregate number of jobs
at the beginning of the shale oil period.

7

What are the channels through which shale oil technology could affect the U.S. economy?
6

We also estimate these magnitudes while allowing the market exposure to the shale oil mimicking portfolio
to change over time by estimating rolling betas during the shale oil time period. Using this approach we
obtain similar aggregate magnitudes to those in our main results.
7
These magnitudes are consistent with estimates in the existing literature for the effects of shale gas
(primarily) on employment (Hausman and Kellogg (2015), Feyrer, Mansur and Sacerdote (2015), and Allcott
and Keniston (2014)). We discuss this in detail in section 3.7.

4

Industries’ sensitivity to shale news can arise through several types of spillovers. To the extent
that an increase in fracking/drilling activity increases demand for output of (imperfectly
competitive) industries that provide labor or materials for shale oil extraction, the positive
news about shale sector productivity is good news for these industries - we refer to this
as the “supply-chain effect.”8 To the extent that increasing income of households involved
in shale oil production, directly or indirectly, improves the health of the local economies,
it might benefit consumer-oriented industries that experience increasing demand for their
goods - we can refer to this as the “income effect.”9 Finally, to the extent that good news
about shale oil supply can depress oil prices, it may benefit a variety of industries whose
output consists of goods that are complements with oil (e.g. cars) or whose expenditure
shares increase through the effect on the consumers’ budget constraints - this can be called
the “price effect.” Additionally, a positive shock to shale extraction technology that lowers
the price of oil (as well as natural gas) can have an adverse effect on industries that supply
substitute energy sources, such as coal.10
We find empirical support for each of the channels described above, based on the different
weights industries receive in the mimicking portfolio that we construct. For example, Oil
and Gas Drilling, Business Services, Engineering Services, and Railroads receive some of the
highest weights in the mimicking portfolio. All of these industries are important components
in the supply chain of shale oil development. Clothes also receives a high weight, which is
consistent with both an “income effect” and a “price effect.” We observe that Coal Mining has
the greatest negative weight in the portfolio, which is consistent with a product market rival
effect driven by being a potential substitute energy source. The advantage of our methodology
8

To the extent that shale oil development puts upward pressure on the prices of relatively less traded
factors, such as labor, there might be a countervailing negative spillover effect on local firms akin to the
“Dutch disease.” Using detailed data on manufacturing establishments in the U.S., Allcott and Keniston
(2014) also find that this effect is relatively small and that the positive supply chain and income effects
dominate.
9
Acemoglu, Finkelstein and Notowidigdo (2013) use oil reserves in the pre-shale oil period to capture
shocks to local incomes. Gilje (2011) documents the impact of windfall shale oil revenues on local economies,
while Cascio and Narayan (2015) focus on the increase in wages of low skilled workers and its consequences
for educational attainment.
10
The “price effect” is quite distinct from the others in that its magnitude can be affected by non-shale
oil supply shocks. We work to separate the price effects linked to shale development, relative to price effects
linked to non-U.S. oil production. To do this, we include a control for non-U.S. oil supply shocks in our
regressions using a second mimicking portfolio based on an OPEC-driven oil supply shock.

5

that uses the entire cross section of (publicly traded) firms is that we are able to estimate the
net effect of the several, often countervailing, spillover effects of a technological innovation a major challenge in the literature (e.g., see Bloom, Schankerman and Van Reenen (2013)).
Importantly, the different channels discussed above suggest that the drop in oil prices
since mid 2014 does not necessarily result in a meaningful change in the overall economic
magnitudes that we estimate. Instead, it likely means that the relative importance of different
channels may change. For example, while “supply chain” and “income” effects may be
reduced, the “price” effect may increase. Consistent with the effect of these channels offsetting
each other, while oil prices dropped 57% from their high in mid-2014 to the end of the third
quarter of 2015, the level of the shale mimicking portfolio we construct remained high (despite
the decline in the equity market capitalizations of the shale oil firms).11
A potential concern with our methodology is that while the shale discovery announcement
we rely on in our empirical design can be considered exogenous, there may have been other
reasons why stock prices changed on our event day. For example, if the overall market
increased for other, non-shale-oil-related, reasons, we may just be picking up the effect of
high market beta as opposed to high shale exposure. We control directly for the effect of
aggregate stock market beta in our main regression. However, since betas are measured with
error, such controls might be imperfect. Therefore, we conduct several additional tests that
demonstrate the robustness of our approach. First, we ask how likely it is that a randomly
picked day would yield a cross-section of industry returns that can be successfully used to
construct a factor that explains the time-series variation in both the aggregate market return
(especially over the shale oil period) and returns on shale oil firms, as well as predict shalerelated real activity. We find that the shale discovery announcement day is by far the single
best day in the sample that can explain these features of the data. Second, instead of using
the shale discovery announcement day to construct the shale mimicking portfolio, we focus
on industries that are known to be part of the shale oil production chain. While this rules out
some of the channels through which shale might impact various sectors of the economy, this
narrower exercise still allows us to recover the underlying shale shocks and provide similar
11

Consistent with the economic effect we identify, shale oil production had dropped by only 8.2% from its
peak.

6

estimates of the magnitude of their contribution to the total stock market value. Taken
together, this evidence sets a high bar for alternate explanations of our results.
Nevertheless, we consider another candidate driver of aggregate stock market returns over
this period, namely monetary policy. We adopt our methodology of constructing a portfolio
that tracks underlying unobserved shocks by analyzing the cross-section of stock returns on
the days of key announcements by the U.S. Federal Reserve (e.g., as in Savor and Wilson
(2014)). We examine several sets of monetary policy announcements, including scheduled
FOMC meetings or specific announcements of unconventional monetary policy. We show
that such portfolios track very closely the returns on a portfolio constructed using market
betas. However, while monetary policy helps explain the stock market run-up immediately
following the global financial crisis in 2009, such monetary policy mimicking portfolios do
not help explain any of the high market returns over the recent time period, and thus do not
take any explanatory power away from the shale mimicking portfolio. This exercise, while
potentially interesting in its own right, serves to highlight the general applicability of our
empirical methodology, as well as the robustness of our conclusions.
This paper proceeds as follows. We describe the data, the general economic setting, and
our empirical approach in Section 2. Section 3 details our econometric approach and presents
the results of our empirical analysis. Section 4 presents the set of robustness tests. Section
5 concludes.

2.1

The Setting
The Shale Revolution: a Primer

Over the five years following the Great Recession (2009 through 2014) the U.S. equity market capitalization roughly doubled, despite fairly anemic rates of growth in the real economy.
Over the same time period U.S. oil production increased dramatically, from 5.4 Mb/d (million barrels of oil per day) at year end 2009 to 9.4 Mb/d at year end 2014. This increase
accounted for 52.2% of overall global oil production growth. Almost all of this increase can
be attributed to a breakthrough technological innovation that allows oil to be extracted from
shale rock formations that were previously too costly to access. This innovation, which in7

volves a combination of two previously known technologies, hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”)
and horizontal drilling, in the matter of a few years has fundamentally changed the global
energy supply-demand balance. Its success was also largely unexpected, as evidenced by the
published forecasts of the Energy Information agency (EIA).
Shale oil and natural gas reserves were long thought to be uneconomic to develop. For
example, as recently as the late 1990s only 1% of U.S. natural gas production came from
shale. Then in the early 2000s Mitchell Energy began experimenting with new techniques
for drilling shale, and found that by combining horizontal drilling with hydraulic fracturing,
natural gas from shale could be economically produced. The unlocking of shale has led to
a dramatic increase in production of natural gas, which ultimately led to lower prices of
natural gas in the U.S. and, consequently, electricity. With low natural gas prices and high
oil prices in 2009, firms began to experiment with using shale technology to extract oil, as oil
and gas are often trapped in similar geologic formations. Figure 1 displays the recent trends
in oil production. Several firms were successful in adopting shale technology in oil basins,
including the Permian, the Bakken, and the Eagle Ford shale. As Panel A shows, with the
adoption of shale technology, production in these basins has increased significantly.
There are three features of the shale oil boom that make it especially interesting from
an asset pricing perspective. The first is that the rise in production was unexpected, and
can therefore be interpreted as a true “Technology Shock”. Panel B of Figure 1 shows U.S.
crude oil production from 2005 to 2014, along with monthly forecasts of future oil production
from the EIA’s monthly publication of Short Term Energy Outlook. Consistent with Panel
A, starting in 2012 U.S. Crude Production rises dramatically. This rise in production was
unanticipated by forecasts, which consistently undershoot production for the first year of the
Shale Boom, before adjusting towards the end of the period.
The second important feature of the boom is its magnitude. While increased productivity
is clearly a benefit for shale oil producers, its importance for the rest of the economy hinges on
the fact that this production increase is significant relative to total world supply. Panel C of
Figure 1 illustrates that the increase in U.S. oil production driven by shale deposits amounts
to roughly 5% of total world oil production, and a roughly 50% increase in production since
2009. While this may not seem large, given the highly inelastic nature of oil demand it has
8

a potential to have a large long-run impact on price levels. Typical estimates of the long-run
demand elasticity (see for instance Kilian and Murphy (2014)) are near -0.25, suggesting that
a 5% increase in world supply may yield up to a 20% drop in price. Oil prices begin to drop
in the latter part of our sample period, and then fall precipitously in the wake of the OPEC
decision in November 2014, which we discuss in detail below. At the end of our sample period
the level of prices is roughly half of its most recent peak.
The final feature that makes this shock somewhat unique is that it originated in a small
number of easily identifiable firms which we designate as the “Shale Oil Index.” These are
firms with a significant amount of production derived from shale oil. Panel D illustrates the
cumulative returns of this “Shale Oil Index” to several stock price indices. The returns to the
Shale Oil Index are plotted with several other energy producer stock indices. The first is the
“Shale Gas Index”, described in Section 2.2, the second is a “Non U.S. E&P Index”, which
consists of oil exploration and production firms outside of the United States. The third is
an index of the four large integrated oil and gas producers on the S&P 500. The cumulative
returns to the aggregate CRSP market index are also included for comparison. As Panel D
shows, the shale oil firms exhibit no abnormal returns relative to other industry producers
prior to the sharp rise in production. However, following that rise, they experience a period
of extraordinary growth, rising roughly 200% in a two year time. These stock returns are
useful for understanding when asset prices began reflecting shale oil expectations. However,
using a “Shale Oil Index” to precisely measure aggregate stock market effects is problematic,
as discount rate shocks, as well as aggregate productivity, demand, and other shocks likely
affect both the Shale Oil Index and aggregate stock prices. For this reason, we focus our main
identification strategy on using asset price changes around important news announcements
relevant to shale.

differently, using the S&P Integrated Oil and Gas Index as our non-shale oil industry portfolio,
the Shale Oil Index and the Shale Gas Index described in Appendix 3, while all the other oil
producers not included in these indices populate the “Other Oil” portfolio, which is included
in our main set of 76 industry portfolios.

2.3

Identification Approach: Shale News and Stock Returns

A simple model of oil production and demand presented in Appendix 1 shows that asset
prices contain information about the technological shocks affecting oil production (as well
as demand). It is challenging to identify these innovations empirically, since both shale oil
productivity and all other shocks simultaneously drive returns to both shale oil firms and
other firms in the economy (in a more general model, this would include changing discount
rates, e.g. through time varying aggregate uncertainty, expectations, or preference shocks).
Our approach to overcoming this challenge involves using stock returns around news
announcements pertaining to oil supply, both from shale and from non-shale sources. The
idea behind this identification strategy is that news announcements that are specific to shale,
and oil more broadly, are plausibly exogenous to other aspects of the macroeconomy.
We exploit heterogeneity in industry exposures to shale innovations to quantify the impact
of shale production on the stock market. We consider the cross-section of industry returns
around a major shale announcement and a significant OPEC Announcement and examine
the performance of this cross-section over various time periods related to shale production.

2.4

Shale Discovery and OPEC Announcements

Hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling provide the basic building blocks for shale development. However, companies that apply these techniques typically need to calibrate them
to particular oil and gas reservoirs (e.g., see Covert (2014)). Often it is the case that the
economics of shale in a given reservoir are unknown ex ante. Therefore when successful shale
12
Alternatively, one could use the standard Fama-French industries available from Ken French’s website.
We construct our own industries in order to generate greater variation in exposure to oil. For example,
”Airlines” are a subset of transportation industries in the most deatiled Fama-French 49 industries.

11

efforts are announced, significant asset revaluations occur. In many cases, a single positive
well result for a reservoir can indicate the potential for hundreds of follow-on wells, which
can have billions of dollars of NPV for a given company.
The largest of these announcements in the sample is the announcement of Pioneer Natural
Resources DL Hutt C #2H well in the Wolfcamp A reservoir. On July 31, 2013 after market
close, Pioneer Natural Resources announced the successful test of the DL Hutt C #2H,
which began production at 1,712 Barrels of Oil Equivalent per Day (BOEPD) of natural
gas and crude oil, with 72% crude oil content. This was the first successful well test of the
Wolfcamp A, and represented a significant improvement of shale potential across the entire
Spraberry/Wolfcamp field, the world’s second largest behind only the Ghawar Field in Saudi
Arabia. Pioneer’s stock price increased 12.2% on this announcement, adding $2.7 Billion
to the firm’s enterprise value. The announcement of these positive well results represent a
unique opportunity to assess how other firms, including in non-shale industries, respond to
unexpected announcements of significant improvements in shale supply. We use industry
portfolio return on this single announcement day as a proxy for an industry’s exposure to
increases in shale productivity.
One concern regarding our reliance on this announcement is that we might overstate the
contribution of shale oil shocks to the performance of industries that are sensitive to oil
prices during our sample period, since its magnitude can be affected by non-shale oil supply
shocks. It is therefore important to ensure that our measure does not pick up industries’
sensitivities to such price effects that are coming from other sources of oil supply. In fact, the
data provides an attractive event for identifying the impact of non-shale supply shocks on
oil prices. On November 28, 2014, the OPEC released the outcome of the 166th Meeting of
the OPEC Conference in Vienna that occurred on the preceding day. The key result of the
meeting was the decision that member countries would not cut their oil supply in response
to increased supply from non-OPEC sources and falling prices. On the announcement day
oil prices dropped by over 10%, and the shale index fell by roughly 8%, while the aggregate
U.S. market return was essentially zero. The return on this announcement day gives us a
measure of exposure to an exogenous supply shock to oil prices, unrelated to technological
innovation in the shale sector. Indeed, just like for the shale announcement, these returns
12

vary dramatically across industries.

Empirical evidence

3.1

Evidence from the Cross-section of Realized Stock Returns

In order to estimate the impact of shale (and oil) news on the cross section of industries we
run standard Fama-MacBeth regressions of weekly excess returns of the industry portfolios
on characteristics, where the latter include the shale announcement return and the OPEC
Announcement return of each industry. The announcement returns are standardized to have
the standard deviation equal to one. We also control for the lagged market betas of each of
the industries estimated before and during the financial crisis, when we would expect shale to
have a minimal impact on market returns. We use betas estimated during both these period
to control for any potential change in the source of market variation during the financial
crisis. We do not control for contemporaneous betas since those may be endogenous to the
shale shock as industries’ relative importance in the market portfolio changes:

Table 1 presents the results of these regressions across four subperiods: Pre-Crisis (01/2003
- 06/2008), Crisis (07/2008 - 06/2009), Post-Crisis (07/2009 - 12/2011), and the Shale Oil
Period (01/2012 - 09/2015). Panel A presents the results using the full cross-section of industries, where as in Panel B the three key industries related to oil and gas (Shale Oil, Shale
Gas, S&P Integrated producers) are excluded. Thus, all of the cross-sectional slope coefficients λt = [λ0t , λ1t , ...] are averaged over subperiods in order to understand the role of oil
shock sensitivities on industry returns during the period when shale oil was – and was not –
a major source of innovation.
The first result is that oil shocks are an important driver of stock returns. The effect identified through the OPEC Announcement return is strongly statistically significantly negative
during the pre-crisis period of rising oil prices. The average Fama-MacBeth slope coefficient
of −0.146 suggests that a one standard deviation increase in an industry’s sensitivity to the
13

OPEC shock translates into a 14.6 basis point per week (or, about 7.6 percent per year) lower
return on average over this period than an average industry. During both the crisis and the
post-crisis periods the coefficient is not statistically significant, as both oil prices and stock
returns fall dramatically during the crisis and then recover. Finally, during the shale period
the OPEC Announcement coefficient is strongly and significantly positive at 0.142 (or 0.156
if oil firms are excluded). This is a clear manifestation of the fact that the falling oil prices
during this period have lifted stock prices of firms that most benefit from low oil prices - the
same firms whose valuations suffered during the period of rising oil costs before the crisis.
What is the role of shale? Unlike the OPEC Announcement, the Shale Discovery Announcement sensitivity is a significant (and positive) driver of returns only during the last
period, when shale production became a significant economic force. When the shale announcement return is the only characteristic its effect is statistically significant, with a coefficient of 0.052, in the full sample, and even more strongly significant, with a coefficient of
0.117, when the shale oil, shale gas, and integrated oil and gas sectors are excluded. This
suggests that the decline in oil prices driven by forces outside of the U.S. (e.g., global demand
or OPEC supply) depressed valuations of U.S. shale and non-shale oil firms to a substantial
degree in the most recent part of the sample. Indeed, when we control for the OPEC Announcement return the shale coefficient becomes strongly significant in both samples, with
the similar magnitudes (0.077 and 0.095). Controlling for the OPEC sensitivity raises the
shale slope because it allows us to disentangle two opposing effects oil prices have on U.S.
firms, in their relation to the shale industry. While the “supply chain,” “income,” and “price”
effects may all be positive for shale, only the direct “price effect” is positive for the OPEC
shock, since it lowers oil prices without helping U.S. production. In fact the effect is negative for the firms that benefit from shale for non-price reasons, since it hurts U.S. shale oil
production and therefore limits the extent of positive spillovers.
Overall, the effect of a one standard deviation increase in its sensitivity to the Shale
Oil Discovery Announcement increases an industry’s stock return over the shale period by
about 3 to 4 percent per annum. Controlling for the pre-crisis and crisis period stock market
betas does not have any effect, suggesting that the shale announcement return is not picking
up industries with (persistently) high (and low) market betas. Note that average returns
14

over the short subsamples that drive the Fama-MacBeth coefficients we estimate need not
represent expected returns. The effect of shale is likely driven by a series of positive surprises technological shocks that have a first order effect on current and future cash flows of a range
of industries but may or may not change their exposure to systematic risk and expected
returns.
Finally, results from these regressions also show that industry market betas are not significantly related to the cross-section of realized returns over the post-crisis or shale oil periods.
This is somewhat surprising, as the both of these periods saw large positive returns to the
market as a whole.13 .

3.2

Constructing the Oil Factor Portfolios

The key question we want to ask is what is the contribution of the shale oil technology shock
to the variation in equity market returns over the shale oil period. Consider an economy
that is subject to three types of shocks: aggregate productivity (or demand) shocks at , shale
oil shocks ztShale , and other shocks to oil supply, ztOther . Then the (log-linearized) returns to
the aggregate equity market can be written as a sum of innovations weighted by appropriate
loadings:

kt
kt
M kt
M kt
M kt
Shale
Other
rt+1
= Et rt+1
+ βM
(Et+1 − Et ) at+1 + β M
a
Shale (Et+1 − Et ) zt+1 + β Other (Et+1 − Et ) zt+1
The toy model described in Appendix 1 presents an example of such an economy and derives
this representation. We are interested in estimating the exposure of the aggregate stock
kt
market to the shale shock, β M
Shale , in particular.

While the previous analysis relies primarily on the cross-sectional variation in average
returns on industries across time periods, the same identification strategy can be used to
extract information about the time-series behavior of returns within each of the subsamples,
and therefore shed additional light on the nature of the oil shocks that we recover. This
information is contained in the time-series of the cross-sectional slopes of the Fama-MacBeth
regressions. It is well known (going back to Fama (1976)) that the coefficients of the individual
13

We discuss this finding, and its relation to monetary policy shocks, in more detail in Sections 4.2 and 4.3

Panel A: All Industries

This table shows results from Fama-Macbeth Regressions on the cross-section of 79 weekly industry returns over different subsamples. The
explanatory variables are the industry return on the Shale Discovery Announcement day (8/01/2013), the OPEC Announcement day (11/28/2014),
as well as market betas calculated for both the pre-crisis and crisis periods. In Panel A all 79 industries are used, while in Panel B, three energy
producer industries are excluded (Shale Gas, Shale Oil, and S&P Integrated Oil & Gas Producers). Returns are weekly.

Table 1: Fama-Macbeth Regression of Industry Returns on Announcement Day Returns

cross-sectional regressions of returns on characteristics can be interpreted as portfolio returns,
since these slopes are given by

λt = Wt0 Rt+1

, ...] is the vector of excess returns on the test assets and the matrix
where Rt+1
= [rt+1
, ..., rt+1

of portfolio weights is given by
Wt = Xt (Xt0 Xt )

−1

,

with matrix Xt containing all of the characteristics on the right-hand side of the FamaMacbeth regression (1), including the constant. Since Wt0 Xt = I, the first column of Wt
gives weights of a unit investment portfolio and all others correspond to zero investment
portfolios that have a weighted average value of one for a given characteristic and zero for all
the other characteristics. Back, Kapadia and Ostdiek (2013) refer to these as “characteristic
pure play portfolios” since they are maximally diversified in the sense of minimizing the sum
of squared weights across test assets, while isolating the effect of a given characteristic on
the cross-section of returns by controlling for other characteristics (including betas).
Here, we start by treating the returns of industry portfolios on the shale discovery announcement day (and similarly OPEC Announcement day) as the characteristic (that remains
constant over time) and use this approach to construct a trading strategy that essentially goes
long industries exhibiting a positive response to the announcement day and short industries
with negative return responses, while exhibiting a zero return on the other announcement day
and zero market beta over the prior periods. In addition to the shale and OPEC announcement returns, we can use the pre-crisis and crisis market beta estimates as characteristics
as well, constructing portfolios that capture the (potential) market rewards for exposure to
beta risk. Thus, we are using the time series of individual weekly slopes λt that produce the
Fama-MacBeth coefficients reported in the Table 1 above.

3.3

Extracting Shocks: from Cross-Section to Time Series

In order to understand the intuition behind our empirical strategy, it is useful to examine it
in the context of our simple model. Consider a cross-section of N industries. Assume that
the return innovation to industry j ∈ [1, N ] is given by
17

j
Other
Shale
+jt+1 .
+β jOther (Et+1 − Et ) zt+1
(Et+1 − Et ) rt+1
= β ja (Et+1 − Et ) at+1 +β jShale (Et+1 − Et ) zt+1

We want to use this cross-section of industries to construct “Characteristic Portfolios” that
mimic the structural shocks. To do this we will need measures related to the exposures
of industries to each fundamental shock, which is not directly observed. For estimates of
exposures to the two oil productivity shocks we focus on the announcement day returns. The
first day is August 1, 2013, the first trading day after the Pioneer announcement on July
31, 2013, the largest shale productivity shock in our sample. We assume that the return to
industry j on this day is only driven by the shale shock (with tildes indicating innovations):
j
Shale
r̃ShaleDisc
= β jShale z̃ShaleDisc
.

This is our key identification assumption in the sense that β jShale is the primary source
of variation in industry returns on that day (i.e., the other shocks - to aggregate non-oil
productivity and non-shale oil supply - are small).
The second day is the OPEC Announcement on November 28th, 2014. We view this
day as clearly having a shock to z Other , but we may also allow for a possibility that this
announcement signaled an increased willingness of OPEC to allow very low prices for an
extended period of time, which could potentially threaten the viability of shale production
in the long run, i.e. a negative shock to z Shale . This yields
j
j
j
Shale
Other
r̃OP
ECAnn = β Shale z̃OP ECAnn + β Other z̃OP ECAnn .

Note that we assume that the idiosyncratic shocks on these days are zero. We do this
because the fundamental shocks on these days are very large, minimizing the relative importance of idiosyncratic shocks. We also assume that the other aggregate shocks are absent on
the OPEC Announcement day. This is consistent with the fact that the total stock market
return on the OPEC Announcement day is essentially zero, despite the fact that a number of
industries clearly benefit from lower oil prices. Intuitively, the impact of the OPEC decision

18

on the industries that benefit from shale through the supply chain and local spill-overs is
negative since the sustained OPEC supply and falling prices were expected to reduce the viability of shale production. In the aggregate, this negative effect roughly offsets the positive
effect on the industries that benefit through the price channel.
We then assume that the industry-specific shocks jt+1 are idiosyncratic, or at least uncorrelated with the shocks to aggregate productivity and oil productivity, or, equivalently, that
market beta of an industry is completely captured by the three fundamental shocks:
β jM kt

If we focus on a period prior to the shale revolution, where we would expect the shale
volatility to be zero, this simplifies to
β jM kt,P reShale

Now consider the standard Fama-Macbeth cross-sectional regression of industry returns
j

j
j
on our three characteristic variables, rShaleDisc
, rOP
ECAnn , and β̂ M kt,P reshale . The slope of the

regression in each period is (X 0 X)−1 X 0 r̄t , where X = [ι, r̄ShaleDisc , r̄OP ECAnn , β̄ M kt,P reshale ] is
an N × 4 matrix. The slope coefficient for each of the three characteristic variables at time t
can be equivalently considered as the return on a portfolio where the portfolio weights are the
corresponding column entries of (X 0 X)−1 X 0 . These portfolios are the maximally diversified
zero investment portfolios which have a loading of one on the characteristic considered and a
loading of zero on all other characteristics. Let W = [w̄1 , w̄ShaleDisc , w̄OP ECAnn , w̄M arketBeta ] =
(X 0 X)−1 X 0 . Thus, the Shale Discovery Portfolio has a return of one on the Shale announcement day and return of zero on the OPEC Announcement day, while the reverse is true for the
OPEC Announcement portfolio. Both of these portfolios are constructed to be orthogonal
to the market in the pre-shale period.

If we assume that the characteristic portfolios are well diversified in the cross-section
(w̄¯t = 0), we can identify the value β Shale
M kt using a regression of the market return on the
three characteristic portfolios.
This method essentially takes the characteristic portfolios as functions of the fundamental
shocks, and asks how much of the market return can be explained by the shale announcement characteristic portfolio after controlling for the other two portfolios, and since any idiosyncratic error is likely to bias estimates downward through a standard errors-in-variables
argument, we view this as the conservative approach.
The individual values of the announcement returns and market betas, as well as the
resulting portfolio weights, are reported in Appendix Table A-2. We exclude the three oil
and gas indices from the portfolio construction, so that we can use the returns on these
indices to validate our assumption that the shocks constructed using other industries do

20

indeed contain information relative to shale oil. Note that since all of the characteristic pure
play portfolios are zero cost, the weights add up to one even though the characteristics do not.
In particular, the industries that receive a negative weight in the Shale Discovery Portfolio
do not necessarily experience a negative return on the day of the Pioneer announcement, but
could simply have a weaker than average positive response (since the market return on the
day was positive).
The most prominent industries in terms of their announcement return responses and
portfolio weights, reported in Table A-2, are quite intuitive. Industries that receive the
largest positive weights in the Shale Discovery are Oil and Gas Drilling (firms in this sector
act as subcontractors for both shale and non-shale oil producers) and Business Services and
Engineering Services (these two sector include a wide range of firms, many of which are
heavily involved in shale exploration and production, directly or indirectly). Railroads are
also naturally sensitive to shale as the boom in oil production in the areas of the U.S. that
are far from the available refining capacity or pipelines saw a dramatic rise in the shipment
of oil across the country via rail. The most negative weights such as for Coal and Gold
Mining are also intuitive, at least for coal, which is a major substitute for oil in heating, etc.
Consumer-oriented industries, such as Clothes, receive positive weights because they have
large shale announcement shocks likely due to the importance of gasoline prices in consumer
budgets, as corroborated by strong positive OPEC Announcement effects of such industries.
For industries like Ground Transportation there is also a clear effect of the complementarity
with oil. Some industries that have strong shale announcement responses receive relatively
low weights in the Shale Discovery mimicking portfolio due to the effect of controls. For
example, Passenger Airlines have a well-above average Shale announcement return of 1.9
percent but receive essentially a zero weight in the portfolio because their response to the
OPEC Announcement is even stronger, 5.64 percent, which is natural given the key role
of fuel prices for airline profits. This industry also has a historical market beta well above
one, potentially further reducing its weight in the shale portfolio. Note that the OPEC
announcement returns line up very closely with the OPEC portfolio weights, loading up
most on industries that benefit from low oil prices, and going short industries that benefit
the most from U.S. domestic oil production, such as Oil and Gas Drilling, Mining Equipment,
21

Oil Pipelines, and Railroads.

3.4

Exploring the Time-series

In order to verify that the Shale Discovery Portfolio return helps us to identify the shale
technology shocks that we are interested in, we begin by examining the time-series behavior
of this portfolio together with the other mimicking portfolios that we constructed.
We first construct an index which reflects returns attributable to shale oil innovations
ẑ Shale by examining the residual returns to the shale discovery portfolio after controlling for
the OPEC announcement portfolio and the two market beta portfolios using a time-series
regression over the full sample period:
ShaleDisc
OP ECAnn
P reCrisisBeta
CrisisBeta
Shale
Rt+1
= ψ 0 + ψ 1 Rt+1
+ ψ 2 Rt+1
+ ψ 3 Rt+1
+ ẑt+1
.

(3)

We then use this regression to construct a “Shale Mimicking Portfolio” whose returns in
CrisisBeta
Shale
.
= RtShaleDisc − ψ 1 RtOP ECAnn − ψ 2 RtP reCrisisBeta − ψ 3 Rt+1
each week are equal to ẑt+1

In order to verify that the cumulative return path of this mimicking portfolio is broadly
consistent with the timing of shale innovations, we plot the cumulative return of this index
along with measures of output and productivity from the three major shale oil plays in Figure
2. As the figure shows, the positive returns that can be attributed to the Shale Discovery
announcement captured in the Fama-Macbeth regressions of Table 1 coincides with the rise
of shale oil production. Starting in 2011, shale oil wells began a rapid increase, corresponding
with increases in the productivity of individual wells. The number of wells leveled off in late
2012, coinciding with a pause in the rise of the shale index, which then subsequently rose
again as productivity and overall output continued to increase.
While the figures are illustrative, ideally we would like to evaluate the ability of our
measure of shale innovations extracted using from asset prices to track shale oil production
and investment activity at a relatively high frequency. One such high-frequency measure of
shale activity that we focus on is the monthly series of rig counts in the three main shale
plays shown in the third panel of Figure 2. Drilling rigs represent the equipment that is used
to construct and drill new shale wells. The drilling rig count as a key indicator of the capital

This figure plots the cumulative return on a Shale Mimicking Portfolio against various measures of productivity for the combined Bakken, Eagle Ford, and Permian shale plays. The weekly return to the Shale
Mimicking Portfolio is calculated as the return to the Shale Discovery Portfolio less the returns to positions
in the OPEC Announcement and Market Beta Characteristic portfolios:
Shale
CrisisBeta
ẑt+1
= RtShaleDisc − ψ 1 RtOP ECAnn − ψ 2 RtP reCrisisBeta − ψ 3 Rt+1

The relative positions ψ j in the other characteristic portfolios are the slope coefficients form a single regression
of the weekly Shale Discovery Portfolio returns on the returns to the other characteristic portfolios for the
full 2003 to 2015 sample. The four characteristic portfolio returns are the weekly slopes of the Fama-Macbeth
regressions reported in Table 1. Oil production and rig count data is from the EIA.

invested by shale firms. Table 2 shows the results of regressions during our post-2012 shale
oil period, in which next month’s increase in rig count ∆RCt+1 is the dependent variable:
∆RCt+1 = δ 0 + δ 1 ∆RCt + δ 2 RtShaleDisc + δ 3 RtOP ECAnn + δ 4 RtP reCrisisBeta + δ 4 RtCrisisBeta + RC
t+1 .
(4)
As shown by the first column, there is large amount of persistence the changes in rig
counts at the monthly frequency, with the current month’s growth in rig counts explaining
roughly 70% of the variation in the next month’s. Controlling for this months change, the
second column shows that this months Shale Discovery Portfolio return strongly predicts
next months variation in rig counts. The remaining columns show that this relation holds
controlling for the returns on the other three mimicking portfolios, which don’t contribute
much explanatory power. These results suggest that our constructed time series proxy is in
fact strongly related to increased activity in the major shale plays.
To provide further validation that our shocks are indeed capturing information related to
shale oil and other oil shocks, we examine their correlation with the major oil-related variables
that were explicitly excluded from their construction: the oil price and the returns to the
three oil and gas equity indices. In particular, we run the following time-series regressions
j
ShaleDisc
OP ECAnn
P reCrisisBeta
CrisisBeta
M kt
Yt+1
= γ j0 +γ j1 Rt+1
+γ j2 Rt+1
+γ j3 Rt+1
+γ j4 Rt+1
+γ j4 Rt+1
+ω jt+1 , (5)

where j = {W T I, S&P Int, ShaleGas, ShaleOil}. These results are reported in Table 3.
Panel A shows results from regressing the weekly WTI oil price changes on the OPEC Announcements portfolio, the Shale Discovery Portfolio, the two market beta-based portfolio
and the aggregate stock market return itself. The OPEC Announcement return is extremely
strongly negatively correlated with oil prices, as expected, since it is capturing the returns to
firms benefitting from low oil prices and hurt by high oil prices. This result is robust across
all time periods, with coefficients between −2.8 and −4.5 in magnitude. This means that a
one percentage point return on the OPEC portfolio corresponds to a (roughly) three to four
percent fall in the oil price. The effects of the total market return variables are not consistent
over time and across specifications.

The coefficient of the Shale Discovery Portfolio is positive and statistically significant only
in the recent shale oil period, with a positive shale return of 1% corresponding to around
a 2 percentage point rise in the oil price. This positive coefficient suggests that the Shale
Discovery portfolio is primarily driven by industries that benefit from the positive spillovers
generated by the shale oil production, more so than by firms benefitting from a potential
effect of shale on the oil price. This validates our use of the OPEC Announcement as a
control for non-U.S. oil supply that drives much of the variation in the price of oil. Indeed,
the R2 of almost all of these regressions are between 40 and 60 percent, with most of the
explanatory power coming from the OPEC Announcement returns. A notable exception is
the post-crisis period, when the U.S. equity market return captures a large part of variation
in the WTI price, suggesting an important role for the strong demand for oil driving up the
prices as the economy recovers from the Great Recession.
Panel B presents results from regressing the S&P Integrated Oil & Gas Index returns
on the same variables. The evidence here is similar, as the OPEC Announcement portfolio
is picking up the variation in the oil prices, which drives much of the fluctuations in the
oil firm returns. The Shale Discovery portfolio is positively correlated with the integrated
producers’ returns during the shale period, but not after controlling for the market return,
when the effect becomes insignificant - and marginally negative in the recent period). Panel
C presents similar evidence for the Shale Gas index, suggesting that while shale oil and gas
might benefit from the same forces that increase global oil prices, there is not a particularly
strong direct connection between the two during the shale oil period that we focus on.
Finally, Panel D shows the same regressions for the Shale Oil Index. Here the effect of the
Shale Discovery Portfolio is markedly different, even though the OPEC Announcement effect
is very similar to those above. The two shale-related portfolio returns are extremely strongly
correlated during the shale period, with coefficients between 2 and 4, approximately (the
smaller coefficient when controlling for the market return). During the other time periods
the correlation is much weaker and not robustly significant, as expected. This suggests that,
even though the Shale Discovery Portfolio return explicitly does not include any shale oil
firms, it loads strongly on industries that benefit from the shale revolution.

Table 3: Explaining Oil Prices and Index Returns with Characteristic Portfolio Returns
This table plots time series regressions where log oil price changes and returns to three energy producer
indices as the dependent variables. The Shale Oil Index is constructed from oil and gas E&P firms primarily
involved in shale oil extraction. The Shale Gas Index is constructed from E&P firms primarily involved in
shale gas extraction. The S&P Oil and Gas Producer Index is comprised of energy majors in the S&P 500
index. Weekly log oil price changes and the index returns are regressed against returns to characteristic
portfolios. The characteristic portfolios are the weekly slope coefficients from cross-sectional regressions of 76
industry returns (not including the three producer indices) on the industry Shale Discovery Day (8/1/2013)
return, the OPEC Announcement day (11/28/2014) return, the industry market beta estimated in the PreCrisis period (01/2003 - 06/2008), and the industry market beta estimated in the Crisis period (07/2008
- 06/2009). In all specifications the original cross-sectional regressions are done using all four independent
variables. The time-series regressions are conducted both with and without the Shale Discovery Portfolio
return in each of our four subperiods. Data are weekly.

Explaining Stock Market Performance

Ultimately, we would like to understand the role of the technological innovations in the shale
oil sector on the U.S. stock market as a whole. A natural way to do this is via performance
attribution, which, in our case, amounts to regressing the market return on the same portfolios
we used to correlate with the oil price and oil and gas indices above:

Table 4 presents the results.
In Panel A, we regress the market return on only the two announcement day characteristic
portfolios. Since the pre-crisis and crisis betas are included in the Fama-Macbeth regressions,
the correlation of these two portfolios to the market return is zero by construction in these
two periods, as is shown in the first two columns. In the second two columns, this is no longer
the case. However, in the post-crisis period we see that the Shale Discovery Portfolio still has
very little explanatory power for the market, while the OPEC portfolio is now very negatively
correlated with the market, due to the fact that in this period the aggregate market returns
are much more positively correlated with oil prices. The more interesting results come in the
shale oil period. In this period, which saw high returns to both the shale portfolio and the
market, we also see a large significant exposure of the market to the shale portfolio. Including
the shale portfolio in a regression leads to a 15% increase in R2 .
Panel B repeats this analysis, but this time including the two market beta characteristic
portfolios. Prior to the crisis we see insignificant positive exposure of the market to the
Shale Discovery Portfolio, suggesting that it has little explanatory power for the market in
these periods, although this is largely by construction. In the post-crisis and shale periods,
we see that our pre-crisis and crisis beta portfolios exhibit large positive correlations with
the market. In particular, these portfolios explain 70% of the variation in market returns
during the post-crisis period, and essentially drive out the explanatory power of the OPEC
Announcement Portfolio in this period. Again in this period, we see very little impact of the
Shale Discovery Portfolio on the market.
The most striking results again occur in the shale period. In this period, while the two
29

market beta portfolios are still significantly correlated with the market return, they no longer
explain as much of the total variation in the market. When the Shale Discovery Portfolio
is included in the regression, the beta of the market on shale is again much higher (roughly
1.73) and highly statistically significant. Moreover, adding the Shale Discovery Portfolio to
the regression increases the R2 from 0.25 to 0.40, suggesting that during this period news
about shale oil is responsible for about 15% of the variation in the aggregate stock market.
In the other periods the contribution of shale to the market variance is essentially zero.

Economic Magnitudes

We can use the coefficients in Table 4 to estimate the overall value effect of shale oil development. The last row of each panel in Table 4 gives the change in the constant term in the
regression of the market return on the characteristic portfolios that is created by including

timated jointly with the unrestricted one, and standard errors for the difference are obtained
via GMM. In the full regression including the beta controls (i.e., as in Panel B), this value is
11.6 basis points for the shale period. Therefore, over the 189 week shale oil period, the total
cumulative return is 11.6 basis points × 189 = 21.92%. As a robustness exercise we allow
for time-varying exposures of the market return to the mimicking portfolios by estimating
rolling regressions and obtain similar results (these are reported in the Appendix).
The estimates above imply that the overall value effect of shale, implied by asset prices is
21.92% of the U.S. total equity market capitalization as of the beginning of the shale period.
The total market value at the beginning of the shale period was $16 trillion, therefore the
total value effect derived from our methodology is 21.92% × $16 trillion = $3.5 trillion. The
standard error on this point estimate does suggest a range of economic magnitudes. To be
conservative, one could use the standard errors of our estimates and calculate a lower bound:
for example, our estimates imply that shale oil development is responsible for at least $1
trillion of the increase in the stock market with 90% confidence.
How plausible are these figures? As a simple check, we can compare this figure to an

Table 4: Explaining Market Returns with Characteristic Portfolio Returns
This table shows time series regressions of aggregate stock market returns on characteristic portfolio returns
in four subperiods. The characteristic portfolio returns are constructed as the weekly slope coefficients in a
Fama-Macbeth regression of the cross-section of industry returns on the OPEC Announcement Return, the
Shale Discovery Return, and industry market betas calculated in both the pre-crisis and crisis periods. The
three oil indices are not included in the original cross-sectional regressions. Panel A shows regressions of
market returns on the two announcement day characteristic portfolios. The exposure of the market to these
two portfolios are zero by construction in the pre-crisis and crisis periods. Panel B repeats the exercise but
this time including all four characteristic porfolios.

to be $338 billion in 2014. The Baker Hughes rig count statistics imply that roughly 78%
of this activity is associated with shale oil development. Despite the recent downturn in
prices, the EIA expects shale oil development to persist for many years. Assuming a 15 year
life on this development and a 10% annual discount rate suggests that the present value of
cash flows associated with shale oil development is $2 trillion. However, the 15 year life
assumption above is based on existing shale oil production relative to proved reserves, as
outlined by the EIA, and does not include probable and possible reserves. The extent to
which these additional reserves are produced or new discoveries are made, the higher the
expected life of the development will be and the greater the value of the resource. This back
of the envelope calculation is consistent with the $3.5 trillion magnitude implied by asset
prices.
Moreover, our method does not distinguish between the market impact of the reductions
in oil prices and a decrease in long-run oil supply uncertainty, which likely resulted from the
emergence of shale oil. Given the potentially quite high counterfactual levels of oil prices in
the absence of shale, as well as the size of the shale industry, both of these factors would be
consistent with a large effect on asset prices.

3.7

Shale Discovery Announcement Returns and Employment Growth

So far we have documented a substantial effect of shale oil on equity market values. We
also assess whether the shale oil technology shock is channeled through real activity. In
order to verify that this is indeed the case we examine employment growth over our sample
period at the level of industries that were used in our industry portfolio construction. We
build a detailed dataset of month-by-month employment by industry from the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, and then calculate the aggregate growth in different industries across the
time periods we focus on in our study. In Table 5 we report the results of regressions where
we estimate the effect of the return from the shale discovery announcement day on average
annual employment growth during different time periods (∆Empltj ).

As can be seen from the results in Table 5 there is a positive and statistically significant
coefficient on the announcement return during the shale oil period. The economic interpretation of the coefficient in specification (7) of Table 5 is that if an industry’s return on the
shale discovery announcement day is one standard deviation higher, it experiences a 0.56%
increase in average annual employment growth over the shale oil period (the announcement
returns are not standardized by standard deviation, this estimate is based on the point estimate of 0.724 multiplied by the sample standard deviation of 0.77). To estimate aggregate
employment effects we multiply an industry’s announcement return by the point estimate of
0.724 in Table 5 and the number of years in the shale oil period, then scale an industry’s
2012 employment by this estimate. We then sum up this net employment change across all
industries, and find that overall employment increased by 4,600,000 jobs, due to industry
exposures to shale technology. This figure is a 4.2% increase in the number of jobs, in aggregate, across the industries in our study during the shale oil time period. When we control for
the OPEC Announcement return and industry betas, the coefficient increases to 0.928. However, when using this coefficient to construct aggregate job estimates to compare to actual
job growth one needs to consider that the OPEC Announcement effect partially offsets the
shale announcement effect for some some industries. Therefore the coefficient in specification
(8) on shale announcement, is offset by job losses due to the OPEC Announcement when
compared to actual changes in employment. Using the coefficient on shale discovery returns
in specification (8) of Table 5, we calculate an aggregate employment effect linked to shale
technology of 5,800,000 jobs. It is also important to note the standard errors on our point
estimates. Using these we can construct a lower bound estimate for the effect of shale oil
technology on employment using specification (8) of Table 5, and find that at least 1,600,000
new jobs are linked with shale oil development with 90% confidence.
The magnitudes we identify above are broadly consistent with recent studies that measure
both direct and indirect effects of shale development on employment, mostly focusing on
natural gas extraction (in contrast to our focus on shale oil). For example, Hausman and
Kellogg (2015) find the indirect effects of shale gas on manufacturing employment alone
of around 280,000 jobs, or a 2.6% increase (manufacturing accounts for roughly 10% of the
overall private sector employment in our sample). Alternatively, Feyrer et al. (2015) estimate
33

that the direct effects of shale gas and oil development contributed about 640,000 jobs through
2012 in the areas of shale discoveries. Allcott and Keniston (2014) find that counties with
high resource endowments experience employment growth of 2.87% when employment in
resource extraction doubles overall. Using recent prices and production data from the U.S.
Energy Information Administration, we estimate the dollar value of shale oil production to
be 2.5 times larger than that for shale gas production. To the extent this ratio is a rough
proxy for the relative economic impact of shale oil versus shale gas, combining the indirect
and direct estimates above, and applying the appropriate scaling yields values well within
the confidence interval of our point estimates for aggregate employment growth.
As a falsification, we show that during earlier, non-shale oil time periods, there is no
statistically significant relationship between the return an industry experiences on the shale
discovery announcement day and an industry’s employment growth. Taken together, the
evidence presented in Table 5 suggests that shale not only influenced asset prices, but had
important real effects on the economy.
Table 5: Industry Shale Exposure and Employment Growth
This table reports regressions of employment growth on the shale discovery return. We aggregate up
employment growth over each of the different time periods of our study: pre-crisis, crisis, post-crisis, and
shale oil. Therefore, the unit of observation in these regressions is at the time period-industry level. Each
time period is normalized to reflect the average annual employment growth during that time period. Data
on employment was collected from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Robustness Tests

4.1

Placebo Test

In this section we consider how unusual the Shale Discovery Announcement day is in generating the results we highlight in our main identification strategy. Given that the total stock
market return is positive on this day, it is possible that the cross-section that we identify
is really driven by market beta exposures (which are hard to measure). So we proceed by
asking the question: How likely is it that a randomly picked trading day could produce a
similar result?
To answer this, we repeat our analysis using all of the trading days in our post-crisis and
shale oil period samples in place of the Shale Discovery Announcement day. We use the results
to construct a “placebo” distribution of the key test statistics of interest. This distribution
then allows us to assess how likely it is that a randomly-picked day would generate a portfolio
that performs at least as well as the Shale Discovery Portfolio on the key economic dimensions
that are most relevant to our study: the ability of the portfolio to explain the time-series of
the U.S. aggregate stock market return during the shale period, as well as the relationship to
the shale oil development itself. Specifically, we consider five statistics of interest. The first
statistic measures the overall return on the total market portfolio during the shale oil period
which is attributable to the shale discovery portfolio. (From Table 4, the relevant number is
kt
= 0.116% in the last row of Panel B Column (8) ). The second
Change in Intercept, ∆γ M
0

is the increase in the ability of the portfolio to explain variation in the market return, which
is measured as the difference in the t-statistics of the slope coefficient of the shale discovery
kt
portfolio in explaining the market return γ M
during the shale oil period relative to the
1

t-statistic on this coefficient over the post-crisis period. (Table 4, first row Panel B, the
difference in the t-statistics between columns (8) and (6) is 4.00). The third measures the
ability of the portfolio to explain specifically Shale Oil Index returns in the shale period. To
create the relevant statistic we take the difference in the t-statistics associated with γ ShaleOil
1
Int
and γ S&P
. (Table 3, the t-statistic of the first row in column (8) of Panel D less the
1

corresponding t-ratio in Panel B). The fourth statistic measures the ability of the portfolio
to explain real shale drilling growth, and is the t-statistic in the regression of monthly growth
35

in the shale oil rig count on the Shale Discovery Portfolio return δ 2 , as shown in Table 2.
The fifth is the t-statistic of the cross-section of industry returns in explaining employment
growth, λ1E (Table 5, first row of column (8)).
Figure 3 plots the histograms of these test statistics simulated using all of the trading
days in both the post-crisis and shale oil periods (07/2009 - 09/2015). Panel A shows that the
distribution of the market return explanatory coefficients is centered around zero but with a
long right tail. Still, the Shale Discovery Announcement day is in the 95.0th percentile of this
distribution. Panel B shows that the distribution of differences in the market explanatory
power as measured as the difference t-statistics between the post-crisis (pre-shale) and the
shale period is also centered near zero, but with a larger left tail. Consequently, there are
fewer days that are “as good” or better at explaining this difference, so that the Shale
Discovery Announcement is at the 98.6 percentile of this distribution. Panel C displays
the distribution of the difference in t-statistics between the Shale Oil Index and the S&P
Integrated Producer Index regression coefficient on the Shale Discovery Portfolio. These are
also centered around zero, with the 3.9 value for the actual Shale Discovery Announcement
day is at the 98.9 percentile of this distribution. Panel D plots the histogram of the tstatistics in the regression of monthly shale rig count growth on the lagged Shale Discovery
Portfolio return. This distribution is centered around zero and quite dispersed. The Shale
announcement day’s ability to link stock return to actual activity falls in the 96.3 percentile
of all days. Panel E shows that the ability of the Shale Discovery day to explain employment
growth is in the 95th percentile of all days. Finally, panel F summarizes the joint distribution
of the test statistics described above by plotting the histogram of the lowest percentile of
the five statistics corresponding to each day in the sample. Thus, it evaluates every day
on its ability to explain the stock market returns jointly with the shale index returns, the
shale drilling activity, and employment growth. By this measure, there is no other day in
the sample that is as good as the Shale Discovery Announcement day that we use, whose
minimum percentile (among the five values above) of 95.0 is the 100th percentile (highest of
1565 days) of the distribution. In fact, the second closest day has the minimum percentile
of 87, which means that there is no other day in our sample that would fall in the 95th (or
even 90th) percentile on all five measures.
36

This placebo evidence confirms that the shale discovery announcement is indeed a unique
event, in that the industry stock returns on the day following this announcement have an
unmatched ability to explain both the aggregate stock market return and employment growth
during the shale period and to capture shale oil related news, both in the returns on shale
stocks and in the real drilling activity.

4.2

Industry Market Betas and Shale Period Returns

In this section we reexamine the returns during the shale period from the perspective of
market betas. We show that industry market betas, estimated either prior to the shale
period or during the shale period, do not explain the large positive returns to the market
post 2012.
The primary argument put forward in this paper is that the positive returns to the aggregate market post-2012 were driven by technological innovations in shale oil. Industries
exposed to this shock experienced positive returns, while at the same time becoming systematically important to the market as a whole. For this reason, traditional “high beta”
industries did not experience positive returns over this period.
As an illustration of this we perform a simple exercise. We construct characteristic portfolios using the cross-section of market betas estimated in each of the four sub-periods, and
examine cumulative returns to this portfolio over the sample. Figure 4 plots the results.
As the figure shows, these portfolios track the performance of the market very closely in
the pre-crisis period, even those constructed using betas calculated in the latter half of the
sample. More interestingly, the portfolios also track the market return very closely during
the crisis and post-crisis recovery, but all subsequently exhibit a large divergence from the
market beginning in 2012, consistent with the hypothesis that a new source of variation was
driving market returns.14
14

Unreported regression results show that all four portfolios exhibit high weekly correlation with the market
return in all periods, but as all have negative or small positive returns in the shale period, none can explain
a significant portion of the market increase over this period.

37

Figure 3: Placebo Tests for the Shale Discovery Announcement day
This figure shows the result of a placebo exercise in which other trading days’ returns are used in place of the
Shale Discovery Announcement day (8/1/2013). Each panel shows the histogram of a specific test statistic.
To generate these histograms, we first obtain the cross-section of industry returns on an alternate trading day,
and then repeat the analysis using these returns in the place of the shale discovery returns to recalculate the
statistic. This exercise is repeated for each of the 1,595 trading days in the post-crisis and shale oil periods to
create the distributions, which are plotted in blue. The red lines show the statistic obtained with the Shale
Discovery Announcement day along with its associated percentile in the distribution of trading day statistics.
The statistic examined in Panel A is the annualized return to the market portfolio return during the Shale
Oil Period explained by the “trading day portfolios”, calculated in analogous manner to the Shale Discovery
Portfolio (The value for the Shale Discovery Portfolio is shown in Table 4). Panel B examines the difference
in the t-statistics on the slope coefficient of the trading day portfolio return in explaining aggregate market
returns during the shale period relative to the t-statistic on this coefficient in the post-crisis period (Table
4). Panel C shows the difference in the t-statistics of the slope coefficient on the trading day portfolio in
the regressions explaining Shale Index returns and those explaining S&P Integrated Oil and Gas Producers
index returns (Table 3). Panel D shows the t-statistic in the regression of monthly growth in the shale oil rig
count on the trading day portfolio (Table 2). Panel E shows the t-statistic when using trading day returns to
explain the cross-section of industry employment growth (Table 5). Panel F shows the minimum percentile
for each trading day’s place across the distributions shown in Panels A - E.

Figure 4: Market Betas and Cumulative Returns
This figure plots the cumulative aggregate stock market return against the cumulative return to characteristic
portfolios constructed using industry market betas form the four sub-periods. The return on the characteristic
portfolio in each week is the slope from a univariate Fama-Macbeth regression of that week’s industry returns
on a constant and each industry’s market beta. This exercise is repeated four times with market betas
calculated over the pre-crisis period (01/2003 - 06/2008), crisis period (07/2008-06/2009), post-crisis period
(07/2009-12/2011), and the shale period (01/2012-10/2015), in Panels A), B), C), and D) respectively.

Monetary Policy Announcements

The period studied in this paper is noteworthy not only for technological innovations in oil
production, but also for the implementation of unconventional monetary policy, such as the
Federal Reserve’s Quantitative Easing program. While several recent papers examine the
impact monetary policy on asset prices, to our knowledge this work has primarily utilized
event studies focused on announcement day reactions (e.g Rogers, Scotti and Wright (2014)
and Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011)), which shed little light on the cumulative
impact of monetary policy over this period. In contrast, our methodology of examining
characteristic portfolios formed using announcement day returns can be used to quantify the
total contribution of monetary policy to aggregate stock returns. In this section, we use the
cross-section of industry returns on monetary policy announcements to create characteristic
portfolios, and find little evidence that monetary policy shocks can explain aggregate stock
market increases in either the post-crisis or shale oil periods.
Including industry reactions to monetary policy announcements during the shale oil period
also provides a test for robustness to the possibility that the results regarding our Shale
Discovery Portfolio are driven simply by changes in the market beta of the relevant industries
during this period. Savor and Wilson (2014) show that market beta is a good predictor of
expected returns on stocks during days of monetary policy announcements by the Federal
Open Market Committee, which are the days when the bulk of the equity risk premium
is realized. As such, these FOMC announcement days are ideal for identifying potential
non-shale shocks to U.S. stocks.
To proceed with these tests we first construct several industry-level proxies for exposure
to monetary policy shocks using monetary policy announcement day returns. We examine FOMC announcements following Savor and Wilson (2014), as well as a group of 22 days
regarding the federal reserve’s quantitative easing program following Wright (2012), Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011), and Neely et al. (2014). Using these days we construct
six proxies. The first three proxies are the single day returns on the three quantitative easing
days which saw the largest positive market return in the sample (12/16/2008, 3/18/2009,
and 8/9/2011). The other three metrics are calculated as beta slopes β Fj OM C from subsample
time-series regressions of industry j returns on market returns using a group of announcement
40

Figure 5: Monetary Policy Exposure Measures and Cumulative Returns
This figure plots the cumulative aggregate stock market return against the cumulative return to characteristic
portfolios constructed using various measures of industry exposure. The return on the characteristic portfolio
in each week is the slope from a Fama-Macbeth regression of that week’s industry returns on a constant and
each industry’s measure of Monetary Policy exposure. In Panels A), B), and C) industry monetary policy
exposure is calculated as the industry return on three major announcements about the Federal Reserve’s
Quantitative easing program. In Panel D) the measure of exposure is the industry market beta calculated
on 22 QE announcement days in the sample. In Panel E) the measure is the industry market beta calculated
on all 95 FOMC meeting and announcement days in the sample. In Panel F) the measure is the industry
market beta calculated on the subset of 12 FOMC days in the Shale Period.

Those groups are the 22 QE announcement days in the sample, the 95 days of FOMC
announcements (both scheduled and unscheduled), and the 12 FOMC days which occur
during the shale period.
As a first step we construct characteristic portfolios using univariate cross-sectional FamaMacbeth regressions for each of our proxies. Figure 5 plots the cumulative returns to each of
these portfolios. Each of these plots exhibits broadly the same pattern, with each characteristic portfolio resembling the pattern of the market beta portfolios shown in Figure 4. These
portfolios generally track the market closely prior to the crisis, and then exhibit the same
large drop and rapid recovery during the crisis period. However, all of the portfolios exhibit
little increase in the post-crisis or shale periods, suggesting that monetary policy shocks have
little explanatory power for the large increase in stock market valuations since 2010.
To show formally that these portfolios do not explain either the market returns or our
findings regarding the shale discovery portfolio, we perform Fama-MacBeth regressions of
industry returns on the shale and OPEC Announcements, this time including our three
beta-based measures of of industry exposure to monetary policy announcements.
Table 6 presents the results of multivariate cross-sectional regressions in Panel A. It is
clear that the estimated impact of the shale announcement returns is completely unaffected
by any of three measures, as all of the coefficients are essentially the same and the various
monetary policy betas have no significant impact on the cross-section of industry returns. In
Panel B, we construct new sets of mimicking portfolios using the slopes from these regressions,
and repeat our analysis of the time-series performance of the total stock market. Panel B of
the table shows that the monetary policy beta portfolios are quite strongly correlated with
the market return over the shale period. However, the inclusion of these controls if anything
strengthens the effect of the Shale Discovery portfolio on the market return. Additionally,
the last line of the table shows the change in intercept when the monetary policy portfolio
is removed from the regression. In no period are any of the three portfolios able to explain
a significant portion of the market return.
These results show that the covariation between the aggregate stock returns and the shale
42

innovations that we identify using the Shale Discovery Portfolio are not driven by monetary
policy shocks. In addition, the fact that market betas on FOMC announcements days in the
Shale Period have little impact suggest that our results are unlikely driven by shocks that
are altogether outside the shale oil sector, providing further validation for our approach.
The exercise above is justified by the fact that the FOMC announcement day returns are
indeed very closely related to industry market betas over the shale period. To illustrate this,
Figure 6 provides plots of the relations between FOMC announcement day betas, market
betas, and industry returns on the shale announcement day. Panel A plots the industry
market beta calculated on the 12 FOMC meeting days in the Shale Period against the industry
returns on the shale announcement day. As the plot shows, there is very little relation, again
suggesting a distinction between the industries’ response to the two type of shocks. Panel
B then plots industry market beta calculated over the full shale period against the return
on the shale announcement day. As the plot shows, there is a slight positive relation here,
but it is not strong. Perhaps the most interesting plot is in Panel C, which shows that the
FOMC announcement day beta is strongly related to the overall industry market beta over
this period, with the former explaining 33 percent of the variation in the latter.
Finally, panel D shows that the shale announcement returns are able to explain a substantial of the variation in market betas not captured by the FOMC announcements (the plot
shows the regression of residuals from panel C plotted against shale announcement returns).
What is crucial for the validity of our identification is that the FOMC announcement returns
do not line up with the shale announcement returns. If anything, they are negatively correlated, albeit weakly. Thus, it is not likely that the shale announcement returns are picking
up some common macroeconomic shock that drives up asset prices over the shale period.

4.4

Alternate Measure of Shale Exposure

In this section we examine whether a simple and robust measure of shale industry exposure
can yield similar explanatory power to our Shale Discovery Portfolio for the increase in the
aggregate market value during the shale period. This test provides a verification that our
results are not being driven by industries which are only tangentially related to shale oil (but
happen to experience a high return on the Shale Announcement day).

In this exercise, we first identify four groups of firms as the major shale-related industries.
These groups are the Shale Oil Index, consisting of firms which own and operate shale oil
leases; Drilling firms, which provide contract services to the primary oil firms; Oil Pipelines;
and Railroads, both of which provide transportation of extracted shale oil from fields to
refineries. We construct a Shale Dummy variable, which takes a value of one for these four
industries, and zero for all others. We then repeat the primary analysis using this dummy
as our metric for shale exposure. Table 7 shows the results.
The first four columns of Panel A show the results from cross-sectional Fama-Macbeth as
in Panel A of Table 7, with the Shale Dummy used in place of the shale announcement return.
What we see here is that the Shale Dummy firms outperformed the rest of the market in
both the post-crisis and shale periods, after controlling for the OPEC Announcement returns,
market beta in each of the first two periods, and the market beta on FOMC day in the shale
period. In Panel B we repeat the exercise of Table 3 by constructing characteristic portfolios
and examining their explanatory power for market returns. As the first four columns show,
the shale dummy characteristic portfolio has a strong positive correlation with the market,
45

but only in the Shale Period. The last two rows of Panel B show the estimate of the change in
intercept in the regression explaining the market return when the shale dummy characteristic
portfolio is removed. Again we see that this estimate is positive and significant, suggesting
that this portfolio has the ability to explain some of the positive market return but only in
the shale period.
The last four columns of Panels A and B repeat this exercise, but this time include the
shale announcement day return as a control the cross-sectional regression, and the corresponding characteristic portfolio is the time series regressions. While the shale dummy still
exhibits significant explanatory power for the cross-section during the shale period, and the
shale dummy characteristic portfolio is still positively correlated with the market over this
period, the magnitude of both these coefficients is reduced. Most strikingly, the 0.084% per
week explained by the shale dummy portfolio in column (4) is reduced to 0.025% per week in
column (8). This suggests that the effect of the Shale Dummy is largely captured by the shale
announcement return. These findings together imply that the two methods yield a similar
result, and provide further evidence that the effects documented previously are in fact driven
by the impacts of shale oil.

Conclusion

In a matter of a few years the technological innovations associated with fracking have revolutionized the U.S. oil market. We document that fracking innovations have had large effects
on the aggregate stock market and the real economy. However, we caution that our estimates do not include or reflect the impact of potential costs or adverse consequences of shale
development that are yet to be understood. Additionally, welfare consequences that are not
linked with job growth or the stock market are not reflected in our estimates. Existing research has documented that shale oil and gas extraction has had localized negative impacts
on the home values of houses dependent on ground water (Muehlenbachs, Spiller and Timmins (2015)). There have been additional unanticipated effects of shale development, such
as an increases in seismic activity in shale producing states, such as Oklahoma. However,
to the extent the negative environmental impacts are well understood already, our estimates

Panel A shows the results of Fama-Macbeth regressions of industry average returns. The first four columns shows regressions of
sub-period average returns on a Shale Dummy variable, the industry return on the OPEC Announcement day (11/28/2014), the
industry market beta calculated in the pre-crisis and crisis periods, and the market beta calculated on the 12 FOMC days during
the shale period. The Shale Dummy variable takes a value of one for industries directly involved in the Shale Oil supply chain
( Shale Oil Firms, Oil Pipeline firms, Drilling Service firms, and Railroads), and zero otherwise. Panel B shows the results of
time-series regressions the market return on the characteristic portfolio returns constructed as the weekly cross-sectional slopes
from the cross-sectional regression in Panel A. The final row shows the change in intercept in the time-series regression when
the Shale Discovery characteristic portfolio is excluded.

document that these effects are offset by positive employment and value effects in the stock
market. The long run impact of shale technology on future economic growth also depends
on the economy’s long-run response to oil supply shocks, which is difficult to estimate. We
use information contained in asset prices to evaluate the contribution of shale oil to the U.S.
economy, to the extent that it is captured in the aggregate stock market capitalization. We
find that technological shocks to shale supply capture a substantial fraction of total stock
market fluctuations, suggesting that shale oil is an important contributor to the future U.S.
economic growth. In doing so we provide a novel framework for how to estimate the effect
of technological innovations on the economy.
