Asset Managers: Institutional Performance and Smart Betas
Joseph Gerakos, Juhani T. Linnainmaa, and Adair Morse
NBER Working Paper No. 22982
December 2016
JEL No. G11,G23
ABSTRACT
Using a dataset of $17 trillion of assets under management, we document that actively-managed
institutional accounts outperformed strategy benchmarks by 86 (42) basis points gross (net)
during 2000–2012. In return, asset managers collected $162 billion in fees per year for managing
29% of worldwide capital. Estimates from a Sharpe (1992) model imply that their
outperformance comes from factor exposures ("smart beta"). If institutions had instead
implemented mean-variance portfolios of institutional mutual funds, they would not have earned
higher Sharpe ratios. Recent growth of the ETF market implies that asset managers are losing
advantages held during our sample period.

Introduction

We document that over 2000–2012 delegated institutional holdings averaged $36 trillion,
which represented 29% of worldwide investable capital. Institutions predominantly delegated
this capital through active, strategy-specific investment vehicles set up by asset managers.
Little is known about these investment vehicles or their performance because a lack of data
has hindered research. By contrast, there is a large literature about the retail side of delegated
management (i.e., retail mutual funds), which according to CityUK averaged $19 trillion over
the sample period. Di↵erences in disclosure requirements likely drive the contrast in research
footprints. Retail mutual funds face mandatory disclosure under the U.S. 1940 Investment
Company Act, while delegated institutional holdings are exempt.
Until recently, research on the institutional sector was at the level of institutions themselves, and not the capital that they delegate, because data about institutions are more
accessible (Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny 1992a). For example, Lewellen (2011) uses 13F filings to study the performance of total institutional holdings (i.e., delegated capital and
capital managed in-house) in U.S. equities and finds that institutions do not outperform
benchmarks. Likewise, there is a substantial literature about the holdings and performance
of specific types of institutions such as pensions and endowments. This literature finds mixed
results about performance.1 Because institutions both delegate capital and manage capital
in-house, one cannot make inferences about the performance of asset managers based on the
performance of institutions in general.
Several papers specifically study the institutional asset management industry. Goyal and
Wahal (2008) and Jenkinson, Jones, and Martinez (2016) examine how institutions delegate
1

The large literature studying performance of pension funds includes Ippolito and Turner (1987), Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1992b), Coggin, Fabozzi, and Rahman (1993), Christopherson, Ferson, and
Glassman (1998), Blake, Lehmann, and Timmerman (1999), Del Guercio and Tkac (2002), Ferson and
Khang (2002), and Dyck and Pomorski (2012). Another literature studies endowments including Brown,
Garlappi, and Tiu (2010), Lerner, Schoar, and Wang (2008), and Barber and Wang (2013).

capital.2 Annaert, De Ceuster, and Van Hyfte (2005) and Bange, Khang, and Miller (2008)
examine the asset allocations made by twenty-six asset managers into asset classes over time
and find performance to benchmarks. Closest to out study, Busse, Goyal, and Wahal (2010)
examine the performance of asset managers investing in U.S. public equities, and also fail to
find performance over benchmarks.
We contribute to the literature by estimating the performance, size, and fees of this sector
using a broader dataset of asset manager holdings and returns than has been previously available. We also provide evidence on what asset managers do to achieve performance. In asset
manager language, we explore the importance of smart beta or tactical factor allocations.
The words smart and tactical refer to tilting portfolios toward toward better-performing
factors. This insight allows us to examine the performance of asset managers in terms of
the Sharpe (1992) empirical model. Our estimates tie positive performance directly to smart
beta investing. We document that institutional asset managers outperformed strategy benchmarks by 42 basis points net of $162 billion in annual fees and that smart beta investing
entirely explained this outperformance.
We obtained data for the 2000–2012 period from a global consultant that advises pension
funds, endowments, and other institutional investors on the allocation of capital to asset
managers. As discussed by Goyal and Wahal (2008), most institutions use consultants in their
delegation not only because of consultants’ expertise in portfolio choice, but also because
consultants serve as the gatekeepers of asset manager performance and holdings data that
facilitate the shopping for and comparison of asset managers.
When an institution chooses an asset manager to delegate a strategy-level allocation, the
asset manager either sets up an investment vehicle as a solo account or mixes the account with
2

Jenkinson, Jones, and Martinez (2016) find that consultants’ investment recommendations do not add
value for institutions investing in U.S. actively managed equity funds. Similarly, Goyal and Wahal (2008)
find that, when pension fund sponsors replace asset managers, their future returns are no di↵erent from the
returns that they would have earned had they stayed with the fired asset managers. Whereas these studies
examine variation in performance conditional on delegation, we examine the benefits of delegation.

a finite number of institutional clients seeking the same strategy exposure.3 Asset managers
then combine these investments into pooled holdings for all clients in each of the strategies
for marketing and compliance reporting purposes. These “pools” are the unit of observation
that consultants and their institutional clients use when evaluating asset managers. We
refer to these pooled holdings as asset manager funds because the databases maintained by
consultants resemble the mutual fund databases and because these funds are a natural unit
to profile and study strategy-specific performance of asset managers.
Our data cover $18 trillion of annual assets on average over 2000–2012. The data include quarterly assets and client counts, monthly returns, and fee structures for 22,289 asset
manager funds marketed by 3,272 asset manager firms. The median fund pools six clients
and has $285 million in capital invested in a strategy. Our analysis focuses on four asset
classes: U.S. fixed income (21% of delegated institutional assets), global fixed income (27%),
U.S. public equity (21%) and global public equities (31%). These asset classes represent the
lion’s share of global invested capital. In these asset classes, we have close to the universe of
institutional asset managers that were open to new investors during this period. We show
that the database does not su↵er from survivorship bias and is not biased toward better
performing funds. Moreover, return reporting is GIPS compliant for most asset managers,
further assuring data reliability.
With these data, we make five contributions to the literature. First, we augment the
literature on the cost of financial intermediation. We estimate that asset managers charged
the average delegated dollar a fee of 44 basis points, consistent with the prior literature that
documents delegation costs of approximately 50–60 basis points for large institutions (Coles,
Suay, and Woodbury 2000; Busse, Goyal, and Wahal 2010; Dyck, Lins, and Pomorski 2013;
Jenkinson, Jones, and Martinez 2016). Our new contribution in this realm comes from the
3

Institutional mutual funds are an exception in that they have large numbers of clients. They are interesting in their own right (Evans and Fahlenbrach 2012), but represent only $5 trillion of $48 trillion in total
delegated institutional capital for 2012.

3

depth of our data globally and across asset classes to estimate aggregate fees. We find that
institutions paid $162 billion per year in fees for delegated fixed income and public equities
assets during 2000–2012, which was approximately twice the aggregate fees paid by retail
mutual fund investors over the same period (French 2008; Bogle 2008).
For perspective on these magnitudes, consider 2012 as a snapshot. If we apply the
estimates of Philippon (2015) and Greenwood and Scharfstein (2013) to total worldwide
investable capital in 2012, the worldwide cost of securities intermediation was $726 billion.
We can compare this top-down estimate with bottom-up calculations for costs incurred by
di↵erent classes of investors. The U.S.-based estimates of French (2008) and Bogle (2008),
applied globally, imply that the intermediation costs for retail delegation through mutual
funds was approximately $100 billion for 2012. Further, Barber, Lee, Liu, and Odean (2009)’s
estimates of retail investor trading costs from Taiwan can be scaled up to the global level
and adjusted for di↵erences in turnover, leading to an estimate of $313 billion in costs for
non-delegated individual trading in 2012. We find that institutions paid $210 billion in fees
in 2012 for delegated intermediation. These estimates leave another $100 billion to cover any
asset classes omitted from these calculations as well as institutional non-delegated trading
fees.4
Second, we document performance from the perspective of an institutional investor who
delegates capital to an asset manager in order to gain exposure to a specific strategy (i.e.,
fulfill a “mandate”). As discussed by Goyal and Wahal (2008) and Jenkinson, Jones, and
Martinez (2016), institutions typically construct their portfolios through a two-step process.
Institutions first determine their strategy-level policy allocations by optimizing over strategylevel risk and return. Investment officers then fulfill the strategy policy allocations either
“in house” or by issuing an investment mandate to an external manager. Because portfolio

risk is incorporated at a higher level, institutions appraise fund performance along two
dimensions—net alpha and tracking error—both relative to the strategy benchmark in a
single-factor model. We find that the average asset manager fund earns an annual strategylevel gross (net) alpha of 86 basis with a t of 3.35 (42 basis points with a t of 1.63).
This positive performance is consistent with institutions being sophisticated investors
(Del Guercio and Tkac 2002), but contrasts with most studies that examine the performance of institutions (Lewellen 2011). Because the unit of observation in institution-level
studies includes both delegated and non-delegated capital, an implication of our results is
that non-delegated institutional capital likely underperforms delegated institutional capital.
Furthermore, there are di↵erences in asset classes covered. Most institution-level studies
focus on the U.S. public equity asset class. In our results, U.S. public equities have the
lowest positive alpha relative to strategy benchmarks. Thus, our results are consistent with
Lewellen (2011) and Busse, Goyal, and Wahal (2010), who both find positive, but statistically
insignificant gross alpha in U.S. public equity using coarser data.
Third, our detailed data allow us to infer, in the spirit of Barber, Huang, and Odean
(2016) and Berk and Binsbergen (2016), how asset managers achieve positive net alphas. The
marketing language used by asset managers speaks of smart betas or tactical factors.5 We
use the Sharpe (1992) to construct portfolios out of such tactical factors that best mimic each
asset manager fund. We choose factors that nest the literature’s factor models across di↵erent
asset classes. To reflect practice, we limit factors to be tradable indexes and the weights
to be long-only and to sum to one. When we estimate fund performance compared against
this mimicking portfolio, we find no excess return over the mimicking portfolio. The fact
that asset managers outperform strategy-level benchmarks but earn returns comparable to
the fund-level mimicking portfolios implies that asset managers provide institutional clients
5
See, for example, Blitz (2013), Towers Watson (2013), and Jacobs and Levy (2014). Moreover, the
employees of asset managers often publish professional articles about smart beta. See, for example, Staal,
Corsi, Shores, and Woida (2015), which is authored by employees of Blackrock.

with profitable systematic deviations from benchmarks.
The results from the Sharpe analysis raise the question as to whether delegation was
worth $162 billion per year. Could institutions have performed as well over the sample
period by instead managing their assets in-house, assuming that they had the knowledge
and ability to implement a factor portfolio? Following Berk and Binsbergen (2015), we
consider the investment opportunity set of tradable indices that was available to institutions
during the sample period. We find that if institutions had implemented dynamic, longonly mean-variance portfolios to obtain their within-asset class exposures, they would have
obtained a similar Sharpe ratio as asset manager funds once we take into account trading
and administrative costs. This finding suggests that asset managers earned their fees at the
margin. Our estimates also imply that the introduction of liquid, low-cost factor ETFs is
likely eroding the comparative advantage of asset manager funds.
Fourth, we contribute to the literature on active management.6 We estimate tracking
errors of 8.7% in models that use broad asset class benchmarks and 5.9% in models that
use granular strategy-level benchmarks. These tracking errors are comparable to Petäjistö’s
(2013) estimates for active retail mutual funds. Hence, given the size of the asset manager
fund market, our findings imply that the literature on active management overlooks almost
half of actively managed capital.
Our fifth contribution speaks to the incidence of returns across investor classes. We
document that the average asset manager fund earns an annual market-adjusted gross alpha
of 131 basis points (t = 3.21) over the 2000–2012 period. In dollar terms, 131 basis points of
gross alpha translates to $469 billion per year, with $307 billion accruing to institutions and
$162 billion to asset managers. Because asset managers may take more risk than the rest of
the market, these results do not necessarily imply that the delegated assets of institutions
earn positive risk-adjusted returns. However, a 131 basis point gross alpha together with

See, for example, Jensen (1968), Malkiel (1995), Gruber (1996), Carhart (1997), Kosowski, Timmerman,
Wermers, and White (2006), French (2008), and Fama and French (2010).

6

the adding-up constraint discussed by Sharpe (1991) implies a market-adjusted gross alpha
of all other investors of

53 basis points. Assuming retail mutual funds earn gross alphas

close to zero (Jensen 1968; Fama and French 2010), this implies a negative gross alpha
either for non-delegated retail capital, which would be consistent with Cohen, Gompers, and
Vuolteenaho (2002), or for non-delegated institutional capital, which would reconcile our
work with Lewellen (2011).

Data and descriptive statistics

We obtained a database from a large global consulting firm (the “Consultant”). Some
consultants build and maintain databases of asset manager funds. These databases look like
mutual fund databases, containing quarterly assets under management and number of clients,
current fee structures and strategy descriptions, and monthly performance of each asset
manager fund (i.e., at the strategy-level). These databases are essential to the consultants’
business model, enabling consultants to attract and service institutional clients who delegate
capital. Asset managers voluntarily report data to consultants because, in essence, the
consultants are the asset managers’ primary clients. The majority of institutional investors
use consultants to construct portfolios (Goyal and Wahal 2008).
We use the term “asset manager fund” to draw a parallel with mutual funds, although in
this setting, the word “fund” is somewhat of a misnomer. Asset managers hold institutional
capital in individual accounts or in accounts that pool small numbers of institutions. When
asset managers report institutional holdings and performance, they add up all the clients
with the same strategy focus into a single reporting vehicle (i.e., a “fund”). This fund is a
reporting vehicle, not a direct investment vehicle per se, but it conveys the performance and
holdings of the particular asset manager in the strategy in question just as mutual funds
would do in marketing.
The pooled strategy-level fund is also the unit used by asset managers to comply with
7

GIPS (Global Investment Performance Standard) reporting standards. What is now the
CFA Institute, initiated GIPS in 1987 to ensure minimum acceptable reporting standards
for investment managers. In 2005, it became the global standard. Compliance is voluntary,
but GIPS has been universally adopted by asset managers.
Because the Consultant’s business model depends on data reliability, it employs a sta↵
of over 100 researchers who perform regular audits of each asset manager and its funds. In
the course of these audits, the Consultant’s researchers consider the strategy placement of
the fund and verify the accuracy of the performance and holdings data. When clients shop
for asset manager funds, they can read these audits, compare the fund to benchmarks, and
read the credentials of the people running the fund. Non-reporting asset managers receive
less attention when the Consultant makes recommendations to its clients, and consultants
and investors infer any lack of reporting as a negative signal of fund quality.

2.1

Aggregate assets under management

The first column of Table 1 reports our estimates of aggregate institutional assets under
management for each year between 2000 and 2012. These estimates are based on the annual
Pensions & Investments surveys, which we describe in the Appendix.7 Total institutional
assets increased from $22 trillion in 2000 to $47 trillion in 2012, representing approximately
700 asset manager firms throughout the period (column 2). The third column reports our estimates of worldwide investable assets, which we detail in the Appendix. Over the 2000–2012
sample period, worldwide investable assets rose from $79 trillion to $173 trillion. The next
column shows that institutional assets held by asset managers remained relatively constant
over the sample period at approximately 29% of worldwide investable assets.
Important for our study is the comparison of the coverage of the Consultant’s database
7
Each year, Pensions & Investments conducts several surveys of asset managers about their assets under
management. These surveys are important to asset managers because they provide size rankings to potential
clients. According to Pensions & Investments, nearly all medium and large asset managers participate.

8

with the Pensions & Investments data. The Consultant’s total assets cover 28% of institutional assets under management in 2000, and rise to over 60% post-2006. In 2012, for example, institutional assets under management in the Consultant’s database are $26 trillion,
which represented 56.1% of total institutional assets according to Pensions & Investments.
Although our data cover $26 trillion in assets under management, this amount is less
than 100% of worldwide delegated institutional assets. We therefore address the potential
for sample bias in our data. It could be that we are simply missing asset managers, who
choose not to report performance to this consultant. The Consultant’s database covers
3,500 to 4,200 asset manager firms per year. When we hand match the names of the asset
manager firms in the Consultant’s database to those in the Pensions & Investments, 82.6% of
the firms in Pensions & Investments are included in the Consultant’s database. We examined
the missing firms and found that nearly half of these firms are private wealth assets or the
assets of smaller insurance company (but not the large insurer-asset managers). Another
16% of the missing firms specialize in private equity, real estate, or other alternatives, which
represent asset classes that we do not consider. The remaining missing firms are retail banks
mostly from Italy and Spain, and boutique asset managers from the U.S., which presumably
cater to specific clients and thus do not advertise. We therefore feel comfortable that we have
close to the population of large asset managers worldwide that serve institutional clients,
except perhaps in southern Europe.
When we instead consider the possibility of selective reporting by the asset managers
included in the Consultant’s database, we consider three potential sources of bias. It could
be (i) that asset managers always exclude certain clients’ accounts, (ii) that asset managers
selectively report assets under management at points in time when returns are good, or
(iii) that they report assets under management but not the returns when performance is
good. Based on discussions with the Consultant, we infer that issue (i) accounts for most of
the missing fund-level data. In particular, the Consultant disclosed that missing from the
database are specialized proprietary accounts. When choosing asset managers, institutional
9

investors can only see funds that appear in the databases. Thus, although the data are
incomplete, they nonetheless represent an institutional investor’s information set for deciding
among asset manager funds that are open for investment.8
Nonetheless, we do not know how these missing accounts perform. Our main concern
is that manager choose to report based on fund performance. However, asset managers
cannot selectively report based on performance and be in compliance with GIPS reporting
procedures. This constraint especially binds starting in 2006, when GIPS was revised and
became the global reporting standard for asset managers. Thus, we will split the sample at
2006 to ensure that our inferences hold in the recent period.
We also can directly test for bias in reporting following Blake, Lehmann, and Timmerman (1999). They state on page 436 that if “bias infected the funds included in our
subsample, they should be more successful ex post than those in the overall universe.” To
implement their test, we create two variables to measure the extent that managers report
to the Consultant’s database. The first variable, coverage, is the percentage of total assets
under management for which the manager reports data to the Consultant on strategy-level
data to the Consultant. The second variable, internal coverage, is the percentage of total
reported strategy-level assets for which the manager reports returns to the Consultant. We
regress fund-level monthly returns on these two variables. We include interactions of strategy
and month fixed e↵ects to absorb strategy-level performance and cluster standard errors at
the month-strategy level. If managers refrain from reporting strategies with worse performance, we would expect coverage to be negatively related to performance. For example, if
a manager’s coverage is 100%, then this manager should have a lower overall return than a
manager who only reports better performing funds.
Table 2 presents results for these regressions with the first specification including coverage
and second specification including both coverage and internal coverage. For both sets of
8

Ang, Ayala, and Goetzmann (2014) make a similar point with respect to endowments making allocation
decisions regarding alternative asset classes.

10

regressions, we find the opposite of what one would expect if managers selectively reported
to the Consultant’s database based on performance—managers who provide higher levels of
coverage have slightly higher performance. The estimates presented in Table 2 suggest that
our data do not su↵er from survival or selection biases.
Two related concerns are survivorship and backfill biases. The Consultant’s recordkeeping, however, mitigates these concerns. Regarding backfill, the Consultant records a
“creation date” for each asset manager fund, reflecting the date the asset manager fund was
first entered into the system. At the initiation of coverage, the manager can provide historical
returns for the fund. Such backfilled returns would be biased upward if better performing
funds were more likely to survive and/or provide historical returns. In our analysis, we
always analyze returns generated after the creation date. In the last column of Table 1, we
show an annual average of 13% of the data are backfilled (and tossed), particularly in the
early years. Survivorship bias may also occur if funds that closed were removed from the
database. However, this is not the case—the Consultant leaves dead funds in the database.

2.2

Aggregate fees

The Consultant’s database includes the fee structure for each asset manager fund. For
example, one U.S. fixed income-long duration fund charges 40 basis points for investments
up to $10 million, 30 basis points for investments up to $25 million, 25 basis points for
investments up to $50 million, and 20 basis points for investments above $50 million. These
parameters are static in the sense that the database records only the latest fee schedule from
the asset manager. However, because these fees are in percent rather than dollars, the use
of the static structure should only be problematic if fees over the last decade materially
changed per unit of assets under management.
Figure 1 depicts three di↵erent estimates of aggregate fees. First, we calculate a schedule
middle point estimate that assumes that the average dollar in each fund pays the median fee

11

listed on the fund’s fee schedule. This fee estimate could, however, be too high. Institutional
investors could negotiate side deals that shift their placement in the fee schedule up. Thus,
we second calculate a fee schedule lower bound estimate, which uses the lowest fee in the
schedule for all capital invested in the fund. In the example above, we would apply the rate
20 basis points to all capital invested in the fund. The fee schedule lower bound estimate
does not, however, account for the possibility that large investors pay less than 20 basis
points. Such instances are likely limited to select clients. Nonetheless, we implement a more
conservative estimate that we call the implied realized fee. Some funds in the Consultant’s
database report both net and gross returns. These funds therefore provide an estimate of
e↵ective fees. We annualize the monthly gross versus net return di↵erence, take the valueweighted average, and then re-weight the asset classes so that the weight of each asset class
matches that in the entire database.
Figure 1 plots annual estimates of aggregate fees received by asset managers for these
three measures, aggregated to the total worldwide investable assets. We aggregate by taking
the weighted average fees in the Consultant’s data and then multiplying by the estimates of
worldwide delegated institutional assets under management from Pensions & Investments.
Based on this aggregation, we estimate that fees received by the top global asset managers
range from $125 to $162 billion per year on average over the period.

2.3

Fund-level assets under management

The Consultant categorizes funds into eight broad asset classes: U.S. public equity, global
public equity, U.S. fixed income, global fixed income, hedge funds, asset blends, cash, and
other/alternatives. We drop other/alternatives, hedge funds, and asset blends because these
funds represent heterogeneous investment strategies that make benchmarking challenging.
We also drop the cash asset class because these short-term allocations play a di↵erent role in
portfolios. Our database starts with 44,643 asset manager funds over the period 2000–2012.

12

After removing funds with no returns, cash funds, asset blend funds, other/alternatives
funds, hedge funds, funds with backfilled returns, and funds that were inactive during the
sample period, the sample consists of 15,893 funds across 3,318 asset manager firms. This
sample encompasses 936,383 monthly return observations. Panel A of Table 3 reports descriptive statistics on the sample. The average total assets under management (AUM) in the
sample is $9.1 trillion. In terms of age, the funds in the database are relatively established
with the average fund being 12 years old. The largest asset classes are global and U.S. public
equity with, on average, $2.7 trillion and $2.4 trillion in assets under management followed
by U.S. fixed income ($2.2 trillion) and global fixed income ($1.8 trillion).
Panel B reports descriptive statistics at the asset manager fund level. For each month,
we calculate the distributions and then take the average of the distributions. The average
fund has $1.8 billion in assets under management, and the median fund has $411 million.
The skew is due to large institutional mutual funds in the database. Hence, we focus on
median statistics. The median fund has 6.5 clients and $55.3 million AUM per client. Many
institutional investors have much smaller mandates. The 25th percentile mandate is just
under $13 million.
We next present fund-level descriptive statistics for the four broad asset classes. The
largest funds are U.S. and global fixed income, which have, on average, $2.6 billion and $2.2
billion in total AUM as of 2012, followed by global public equity ($1.7 billion) and U.S. public
equity ($1.4 billion). Assets under management per client are also larger for fixed income
funds than for equities. For example, the median per client investment in a U.S. fixed income
fund is $74 million, compared to $30.6 million for U.S. public equity. Thus, fixed income
investments are larger in fund size and mandates per client.

13

2.4

Fund-level fees

We next examine fee distributions by asset class and client size. Panel A of Table 4 reports
that the mean value-weighted fee is 44 basis points. This corresponds with the schedule
middle point estimate presented in Figure 1, which aggregates up to $162 billion if applied
to all delegated institutional assets. The value-weighted mean fee is lowest for U.S. fixed
income (28.7 basis points), followed by global fixed income (31.9 basis points), U.S. public
equity (49.2 basis points) and global public equity (48.2). The global asset classes have more
right-skew, accounting for the larger means.
A natural question arises of who pays these fees. The equal-weighted fee is 56 basis points.
Funds with lower assets under management are more expensive, as one might expect if larger
clients get price breaks. We do not observe individual client investments in each fund. We
can, however, examine the distribution of fees conditional on the fund’s average mandate
size. Panel B of Table 4 presents these conditional distributions. Fees trend downward in
assets per client. For example, when the assets per client are less than $10 million, the
value-weighted mean fee ranges from 60.9 to 66.8 basis points, but is 37 basis points or less
when the assets per client are greater than $1 billion.9
Our fee estimates are in line with those reported in both the press and academic research.
For example, Zweig (2015) reports that CalPERS paid an average fee of 48 basis points
in 2012. Coles, Suay, and Woodbury (2000) describe the fee price breaks for closed-end
institutional funds. They find that a typical fund charges 50 basis points for the first $150
million, 45 basis points for the next $100 million, 40 basis points for the subsequent $100
million, and 35 basis points allocations above $350 million. Examining active U.S. equity
institutional funds, Busse, Goyal, and Wahal (2010) find that fees are approximately 80 basis
points for investments of $10 million and approximately 60 basis points for investments of
$100 million.
9

The very small mandates (less than $1 million) are likely to be in institutional mutual funds, which may
explain why the average fees are slightly lower on the first row than on the second.

14

Beyond scale e↵ects and the negotiating power held by large investors, asset managers
may take into account other factors to determine an institution’s willingness-to-pay, such
as the ability of institutions to manage capital in-house, behavioral biases, or agency issues
associated with delegation.10 We do not capture such factors in our analysis.

Alpha relative to the market

We start by comparing the performance of asset managers to the overall market. Panel A
of Table 5 reports estimates of gross and net alphas from a market model that subtracts
the returns on the broad asset class benchmarks.11 We implement monthly value-weighted
regressions of asset manager fund returns on broad asset class benchmark returns, constraining the market beta to be equal to one. Alphas in this specification represent simple
value-weighted, monthly returns over the benchmark index. Tracking errors are defined as
the standard deviation of the residual in a model that allows for a non-zero alpha. For
exposition, we annualize alphas and tracking errors in all of our tables. We find that asset
manager funds exhibit a market-adjusted gross alpha of 131 basis points annually, with a t
of 3.21, and a net alpha of 88 basis points, with a t of 2.14.
Which asset classes account for the positive performance? The rows of Panel B report the
net alphas and portfolio weights by year and asset class, and the far right column reports the
time series of gross alphas. The bottom row reports how the asset classes each contribute
to add up to the 131 basis points. The alpha contribution comes from global equity (50

See, for example, Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1992b), Brown, Harlow, and Starks (1996), Chevalier
and Ellison (1997), Gil-Bazo and Ruiz-Verdú (2009), and Gennaioli, Shleifer, and Vishny (2015).
11
In our analysis, we use the following broad asset class benchmarks: Russell 3000 (U.S. public equity),
MSCI World ex U.S. Index (global public equity), Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Index (U.S. fixed income),
and Barclays Capital Multiverse ex US Index (global fixed income). Table A3 provides return statistics for
the benchmarks and the Consultant’s funds mapped to each asset class.

basis points), U.S. equity (40 basis points), U.S. fixed income (22 basis points), and global
fixed income (17 basis points). The decomposition also indicates that positive alpha is
partly driven by timing (i.e., having greater weights invested in asset classes that performed
well during that period). We can quantify the timing contribution. If asset manager funds
invested with the average weights across the asset classes (i.e., did not dynamically adjust
the asset class portfolio weights), gross alpha would have been 102 basis points. Hence, 29
basis points of alpha is due to timing across asset classes.
Given that asset managers funds earn positive alpha in a sample that encompasses over
13% of the total worldwide investable assets, the adding-up constraint argument of Sharpe
(1991) implies that the rest of the market earns negative gross alphas relative to the market.
If we assume that there is no selection bias in our data relative to the aggregate delegated
institutional capital in the Pensions & Investments surveys, we can extrapolate our estimates to approximately 29% of worldwide investable assets. The market clearing constraint
suggests that if asset manager funds return a positive 131 basis points gross over the index,
everyone else must return a gross 53 basis points below the index.12
We can convert this gross alpha into dollars. Maintaining the assumption that the Consultant’s database is representative of the Pensions & Investments sample, asset manager
funds collectively earn $469 billion per year from the rest of the market. Of this amount,
$162 billion accrues to asset managers in fees and $307 billion accrues to institutions. In
terms of the dollar value added measure of Berk and Binsbergen (2015), the average asset
manager fund generates $181,811 in value-added per month, which is similar to the estimates
of Berk and Binsbergen (2015) for retail equity mutual funds ($140,000 per month). Our
results together with the finding of Fama and French (2010) that retail mutual funds’ gross
alphas are close to zero suggest that asset managers earn positive alphas at the expense of

Performance

As discussed by Goyal and Wahal (2008) and Jenkinson, Jones, and Martinez (2016), institutions typically construct their portfolios through a two-step process. Institutions first
determine their strategy-level policy allocations by optimizing over strategy-level risk and
return. Investment officers then fulfill strategy policy allocations either “in house” or by
issuing an investment mandate to an external manager. Because overall portfolio risk is typically incorporated in the first-step of determining strategy allocations, institutions generally
appraise fund performance relative to only the strategy benchmark. Fund performance is
commonly reported in two dimensions—net alpha and tracking error estimated in a strategylevel factor model.13
3.2.1

Asset class benchmarked performance

To place out strategy-level benchmark results (in the next subsection) in context, we first
evaluate performance relative to broad asset class benchmarks. We regress monthly fund
returns in excess of the one-month Treasury bill on the excess return of each benchmark. We
estimate these regressions separately for funds’ gross and net returns. Our prior was that
institutions investing in asset manager funds likely have longer investment horizons than
retail investors and are thus willing to hold more market exposure (i.e., betas higher than
one in the traditional CAPM sense). Thus, we expected that the 131 basis points gross alpha
from above would decline in a factor model of performance. The data did not support our
prior. Table 6 reports that the overall (row 1) beta is less than one (0.93). Asset manager
funds exhibit gross and net alphas of 189 basis points and 145 basis points. These estimates
13

Our focus on a single factor is consistent with the findings of Barber, Huang, and Odean (2016) and
Berk and Binsbergen (2016), who find that mutual fund flows respond to a single-factor model rather than,
for example, to multi-factor models.

17

do not, however, reflect performance from the viewpoint of an institutional investor because
the benchmark is not at the strategy level.
Nevertheless, we can compare these broad market results to those of Lewellen (2011)
and Busse, Goyal, and Wahal (2010). Using aggregate institutional holdings of U.S. public
equities taken from 13-F filings, Lewellen (2011) finds an insignificant gross alpha of 32 basis
points (annualized) in a market model. For U.S. equity asset manager funds, Busse, Goyal,
and Wahal (2010) estimate a gross alpha for U.S. equities of 64 basis points per year. Their
estimate is not statistically significant, which may be driven by di↵erences in sample period
and their use of quarterly rather than monthly data. Lewellen’s lower estimate may be due
to the non-delegated holdings of institutions, that are not included in our sample or in that
of Busse, Goyal, and Wahal (2010).
3.2.2

Strategy benchmarked performance

The Consultant’s database classifies the asset manager funds into 170 granular strategy
classes (e.g., Australian equities is a strategy class under the broad asset class of global
public equity). In addition, the database includes a strategy-level benchmark for each fund.
The Consultant sets the benchmarks based on the suggestion of the asset manager, auditing
each strategy to ensure that the proposed benchmark is appropriate for the fund. We evaluate
performance using the modal benchmark in the strategy class. If the benchmark chosen has
less than 10% coverage of funds in the strategy, we instead use the benchmark covering
the most assets under management in the strategy. We list the 170 strategies and their
benchmarks in Table A5 of the Internet Appendix.
Panel A of Table 7 reports estimates of asset manager fund performance from the viewpoint of an institutional investor; namely, performance in a strategy-level single factor model.
We find a gross alpha of 86 basis points (t = 3.35) and a net alpha of 42 basis points (t =
1.63). In this estimation, the precision of benchmarking improves materially, especially in

18

the global asset classes. The model’s explanatory power increases from 69.9% (Table 6) to
82.3% (Table 7) when we replace broad asset class benchmarks with strategy-level benchmarks. Tracking error falls to 5.6%, which is almost identical to the Del Guercio and Tkac
(2002) estimate for pension funds and in line with Petäjistö’s (2013) estimate for moderately
active retail mutual funds.14 Our beta estimate remains less than one, at 0.94. Thus, asset
manager funds achieve performance with lower strategy-level risk, rather than by choosing
lower risk benchmarks to make their performance look better. If managers strategically chose
lower risk benchmarks, then the beta would likely be greater than one.
3.2.3

Robustness of strategy-level results to benchmarking and sample selection

Panel B presents results for alternative samples to evaluate the robustness of our results.
The first row limits the sample to funds that enter the platform within a year after they are
started. This restriction is potentially important because it restricts the analysis to funds
with minimal amount of backfilling. Although we remove all backfilled data throughout
this study, it is still possible that established and successful funds systematically di↵er from
new funds. For this restricted sample, however, the alpha only marginally attenuates to an
estimate of 0.80 (t = 3.03).
The second row of Panel B restricts the sample to post-2006. We use this cuto↵ for
three reasons. First, the consultant’s coverage, as a fraction of Pensions & Investments total
AUM, is higher after this date. Second, this part of the sample captures all of the crisis
period. Third, GIPS reporting standards were in force during this period. The gross alpha
estimate remains at 0.67 (t = 1.92) for this sub-period. The bottom row of Panel B restricts
the sample to asset managers who report performance for funds representing at least 85% of
their total institutional assets under management (i.e., the variable “coverage” from Table 2
14

Petäjistö (2013) reports an average tracking error of 7.1% for actively managed retail mutual funds. He
also estimates tracking errors by fund type, finding a tracking error of 15.8% for concentrated mutual funds,
10.4% for factor bets, 8.4% for stock pickers, 5.9% for moderately active funds, and 3.5% for closet indexers.

19

is greater than 85%, which is the 75th percentile). We continue to find similar results for this
restricted sample even though the average number of funds per month drops precipitously
from 4,668 for the full sample to 437 for this restricted sample.
For benchmarking robustness, we compare the performance of asset manager funds with
the performance of mutual funds. We use mutual fund data from CRSP’s survivorshipbias free database. For each asset manager strategy, we use the CRSP classification codes
to identify all mutual funds that follow the same strategy. We then compute the valueweighted return series of these mutual funds. Table 8 reports the di↵erences between the
value-weighted returns earned by asset manager funds and mutual funds on both gross and
net basis.
The average asset manager fund’s net return exceeds that of the average mutual fund
by 110 basis points per year over the sample period. This di↵erence is significant with a t
of 2.43. This performance di↵erence emanates from di↵erences in both gross performance
and fees. In the comparison of gross returns, the average dollar invested in asset manager
funds outperforms the dollar invested in mutual funds by 50 basis points; the di↵erence in
fees makes up for the remaining 60 basis points. The last row reports the average size of
the mutual fund comparison group. Across all asset classes, for example, we benchmark
the average dollar invested in asset manager funds against 376 mutual funds in the typical
month. The asset-class breakdown shows that the performance di↵erences, on both gross and
net basis, are particularly large in the fixed income asset classes. The net return di↵erence
is positive but insignificant in U.S. public equity, and negative and insignificant in global
public equity.
These estimates are consistent with the research on actively managed mutual funds. Fama
and French (2010) show that, collectively, actively managed U.S. equity funds resemble the
market portfolio. A comparison of asset manager funds against the gross return earned by
mutual funds is therefore close to our broad asset class comparison, except that the mutual
fund “benchmark” is a noisier version of the broad asset class. The typical actively managed
20

mutual fund is also expensive; the gross and net alpha estimates in Fama and French (2010,
Table II) suggest that the average dollar invested in these funds pays 95 basis points in fees,
which is far more than the average dollar invested in the asset manager funds.
To provide insight into how funds outperform benchmarks, Table 9 reports raw returns,
standard deviations, and Sharpe ratios for the funds, the broad asset class benchmarks, and
the strategy-level benchmarks. The statistics are value-weighted to reflect the investments of
the asset manager funds. Focusing on the last row, we show that the strategy-level indices in
equity and fixed income have a higher Sharpe ratio (0.26) over the period than the broad asset
class indices (0.18). Asset manager funds look almost identical to strategy indices in terms of
standard deviation (10.33 versus 10.37), but they achieve a higher return (5.23 versus 4.82).
This pattern holds for each of the public equity and fixed income asset classes reported on
the other rows of Table 9. These results together with those in Tables 7 and 8—which show
that asset manager funds outperform strategy and mutual fund benchmarks—suggest that
asset manager funds outperform their strategy benchmarks by taking risks outside those
captured by the specific strategy.

3.3

Sharpe (1992) analysis

Given our performance results, we turn to the question of how asset managers generate
positive net alphas relative to strategy benchmarks. To answer this question, we implement
the Sharpe (1992) model that decomposes fund returns into loadings on tradable indices.
This framework allows us to test whether tactical or smart beta exposures explain what
asset managers do to achieve positive net alpha and whether, and at what indi↵erence cost,
institutions could have replicated asset manager returns by managing assets in-house.

21

3.3.1

Estimating mimicking portfolios for asset manager funds from tradable
factors

We implement the Sharpe analysis as follows. We first gather a set of tradable factors
(i.e., those with tradable indices) including the broad asset class benchmark, which varies
by fund. We start with the 12 original factors of Sharpe (1992), but with modifications to
reflect changes in market weights since the original paper (e.g., replacing Japanese market
indices with that of emerging markets). We then augment the list to map to factors studied
in the finance literature across asset classes.

For U.S. equity, we include size and value

factors, which have statistical power in predicting the cross-section of stock returns (Fama
and French 1992) and explain the majority of variation in actively managed U.S. equity
mutual fund returns (Fama and French 2010). For global equity, we include indices of
European equities and emerging markets. For U.S. fixed income, we include indices to span
di↵erences both in riskiness and maturity, including indices of government fixed income of
di↵erent maturities, corporation investment grade bonds, and mortgage-backed securities.
These indexes are close to those that Blake, Elton, and Gruber (1993) use to measure the
performance of U.S. bond mutual funds. The global fixed income factors capture returns
on government and corporate bonds both in Europe and emerging markets. The following
table lists the original factors used by Sharpe (1992) and those used in our analysis.

For each fund, we regress monthly returns against the 15 factors using data up to month
t

1. We constrain the regression slopes to be non-negative and sum to one, following

(Sharpe 1992). We then use the estimated loadings to construct a dynamic mimicking style
portfolio for each fund. Because we constrain the loadings to sum to one for each fund, they
can be interpreted as portfolio weights.15 A benefit of the Sharpe methodology is that these
non-negative weights yield clean inferences about fund exposures (Sharpe 1992). Panel A of
Table 10 presents the factor weight estimates, where we have estimated the weights fundby-fund and taken value-weighted averages by broad asset class. For example, the average
weight on the Russell 3000 (the broad asset class benchmark) for U.S. public equity funds
is 9.9%. The remaining rows present the deviations from the benchmark. For example,
the average U.S. public equity fund holds a 28.8% weight in the S&P 500/Citigroup Value
benchmark.
The second step of the Sharpe analysis assesses whether the factor loadings captured in

We also estimated the regressions with the constraint that the coefficients sum to less than or equal to
one. For this specification, the average weights sum to 0.99.

23

the mimicking style portfolio are the source of the positive asset manager fund performance.
We estimate the factor loadings using rolling historical data to ensure that our second step
performance measurement is out-of-sample.16 For each fund-month, we calculate the fund’s
return in excess of the style portfolio. Panel B of Table 10 reports monthly value-weighted
average excess returns over the mimicking style portfolio for each broad asset class and the
associated t-statistics.
We find that gross returns are statistically indistinguishable from the mimicking portfolios, across all asset classes and for each broad asset class individually. The excess return
estimate for all asset classes is

0.27 with a t of

0.77. Statistically and economically, the

mimicking portfolio entirely accounts for the positive fund performance that we documented
in Tables 6, 7, and 8. This result is consistent with our inference from the comparisons of
funds and asset class benchmarks in Table 9—asset manager funds achieve outperformance
by exchanging lower strategy-risk for higher other risks (tactical factor risk) that outperform
benchmarks.
Does performance generated through factor exposures represent skill? This question
relates to Berk and Binsbergen (2015), who consider the proper benchmarking of mutual
funds. If internal management by the client cannot reproduce a tactical exposure in an
asset class, then these authors suggest that we should attribute that exposure loading to
a value-added activity that the fund provides its clients. Cochrane (2011) o↵ers a similar
interpretation:
“I tried telling a hedge fund manager, “You don’t have alpha. Your returns
can be replicated with a value-growth, momentum, currency and term carry,
and short-vol strategy.” He said, “Exotic beta is my alpha. I understand those
systematic factors and know how to trade them. My clients don’t.” He has a
point. How many investors have even thought through their exposures to carrytrade or short-volatility. . . To an investor who has not heard of it and holds the
market index, a new factor is alpha.”
16

In Table A4 of the Appendix, we present similar results when we estimate the Sharpe model using a
jackknife procedure in which we use the full sample except for month t, or in which we exclude observations
that are from six months before through six months after month t.

24

Cochrane (2011)
3.3.2

Do investors pay more for successful tactical betas?

If these factor exposures represent skill, then investors presumably are willing to pay for such
performance. Therefore, we next examine whether fees in the cross section of asset manager
funds correlate positively with the performance of the fund’s style portfolio. Investors may
also pay for “skill” that is not captured by the factor exposures (the gross fund return residual
after subtracting out the return on the style portfolio). Table 11 presents regressions that
estimate the relation between fees and these two return components. Panel A presents panel
estimates, which include month-asset class fixed e↵ects. This panel allows us to estimate
the marginal e↵ect of return components on fees within asset class-month. To ensure that
the return components obtained from the Sharpe analysis are pre-determined regressors, we
measure fees as of the end of the sample period—either in June 2012 or when the strategy
disappears. Given that the fee observation is the same throughout the panel for each fund,
we cluster the standard errors at the fund-level.
Panel A of Table 11 shows that fees positively and significantly correlate with the returns
on the style portfolio and the residual component. The coefficient on the style portfolio for
the all asset classes specification is 6.01 (t = 5.51). To put this magnitude in context, the
mean of the dependent variable is 60.0 basis points of fees, similar to the equal-weighted
average fees we report in Table 4. A one-standard deviation higher mimicking style portfolio
return (4.07 basis points) associates with a fee that is higher by: 12 months ⇤ 0.0601 ⇤ 4.07
= 2.94 basis points (i.e., a 4.9% higher fee relative to the baseline mean fee). We also find
a positive significant coefficient for the residual return component. However, the marginal
e↵ect of this correlate is much lower. Using the same calculation, a one-standard deviation
higher residual return (1.99 basis points) associates with fee being only 0.32 basis points
higher. Noteworthy, however, is that the significance of the residual return component is

25

being driven by fixed income asset classes. In global fixed income, for instance, a one standard
deviation higher residual return associates with a 1.5% higher fee than the mean for that
asset class.
As an alternative to the panel specification in Panel A, we estimate cross-sectional regressions with one observation per fund. We first estimate panel regressions of style returns
and residual returns on month-asset class fixed e↵ects. The independent variables in our collapsed specification are the time series averages of these style and residual returns, purged
of the month-asset class e↵ect. We find robust evidence that investors pay for tactical factor
exposures. A one-standard deviation higher return on the style portfolio translates into fees
that are higher by 2.42 basis points. The residual component only matters in global fixed
income. In sum, our estimates suggest that asset manager funds charge fees, and investors
pay fees primarily for performance generated through tactical factor exposures, especially
for equity strategies.
3.3.3

“In-house” implementation of factor index loadings

The results from the Sharpe analysis raise the question of whether institutional investors
could do as well as asset manager funds if they had instead implemented factor loading portfolios in-house. To address this question, we discard our asset manager data and construct
rolling optimal portfolios using only historical data on tradable factor indices. We first use
the standard algorithm, treating the factor indices as the assets, to generate mean variance
(MV) efficient portfolios separately for each of the four asset classes. We implement this
optimization using data up to month t

1, and then calculate the return on the optimal

portfolio for month t. We aggregate across asset classes by applying asset managers’ month
t

1 asset class weights for month t returns.
We then implement two modifications to the mean-variance algorithm to generate more

stable and simpler-to-implement optimal portfolios that avoid extreme short or long posi-

26

tions in factors.17 The first simpler portfolio forces the covariance matrix to be diagonal to
eliminate extreme loadings based on covariances and sets any negative estimated risk premiums to zero. The second alternative portfolio is a mean-variance portfolio with short-sale
constraints imposed in the optimization.
Panel A of Table 12 presents the gross and net performance along with the implied Sharpe
ratio for asset manager funds. Over the 2000–2012 period, asset manager funds earned 5.2%
in gross returns with a standard deviation of 10.4% (Sharpe ratio = 0.3). Panel A then
presents gross performance for the replicating portfolios. The standard MV portfolio exhibits
a lower Sharpe ratio, 0.16, than asset manager funds. However, the two alternative MV
portfolios have higher Sharpe ratios than the actual asset manager portfolios: MV analysis
with a diagonal covariance matrix, 0.37, and MV analysis with short-sale constraint, 0.34.
In the rightmost column of Panel A of Table 12, we report the cost that would make
an institution indi↵erent in Sharpe ratio terms between implementing the MV portfolio and
delegating to asset managers. That is, the indi↵erence cost solves for cost in:

Focusing on the diagonal MV portfolio, we find that institutions would be indi↵erent between
delegating and managing assets in-house if the cost of managing assets in-house was 85.5 basis
points. This 85.5 basis points must cover both administrative costs and trading fees. In
terms of administrative costs, Dyck and Pomorski (2012) find that large pension funds incur
approximately 12 basis points in non-trading costs to administer their portfolios.
To provide an estimate of the trading costs, we gather historical institutional mutual
fund and ETF fee data from CRSP and Bloomberg covering the factors of the replication.
We present the averages of the time series in Panel C of Table 12. Using these series, we
17

For a discussion of the measurement error issues associated with the standard mean-variance solution,
see DeMiguel, Garlappi, and Uppal (2009).

27

simulate the cost of implementing the replication for four di↵erent trading fee estimates:
Quartile 1, Median, and Quartile 3 of the institutional mutual funds, sorted by cost, and
the end-of-the-period ETFs. Panel B of Table 12 reports these results. Investing in the
diagonal MV factor portfolio at the trading cost of the median institutional mutual fund
would have cost 88.5 basis points in fees. Investing at the Quartile 1 fees would have cost
66.1 basis points. The indi↵erence cost for the diagonal MV portfolio rule (85.5 basis points
from Panel A) is similar to the sum of the administrative costs and the Quartile 1 fees (12 +
66.1 = 78.1 basis points). At this cost, an investor would be indi↵erent between managing
assets in-house and delegating assets. At any mutual fund fees, the investor would likely
prefer delegating.
Importantly, Panel B of Table 12 shows that even the Quartile 1 trading-cost estimate
is high relative to the end-of-period ETF fees. Although many ETFs were not available
over the full sample period (the ETF inception dates are included in Panel C), we consider
a strategy that trades ETFs at their end of period fees. The first row of Panel B reports
that at the end of period ETF fees, the portfolio would have cost only 24 basis points, thus
tilting the preference away from delegating to asset managers toward investing in-house. The
introduction of liquid, low cost ETFs is likely eroding the comparative advantage of asset
managers.
This analysis is subject to several caveats. First, we assume that the necessary liquidity
is available for the ETFs, index funds, and institutional mutual funds that an institution
would use to replicate. Second, we assume that all institutions face the same trading costs.
Third, we assume that institutions are sophisticated. Institutions must know which factors
could be used to improve performance, and they have to know how to implement the required
loadings in real time. These caveats favor delegation via asset managers. Put di↵erently,
less-sophisticated institutions or instittions who receive other (non-fee based) benefits from
asset managers would likely choose delegation over in-house management.

Conclusion

We provide new facts about the investment vehicles into which institutions delegate assets.
Over the period 2000-2012, institutional investors delegated an average of $36 trillion (29%
of worldwide investable assets) to asset managers, paying an annual cost of $162 billion
per year, or 44 basis points per dollar invested. In return, asset managers pooled a small
number of institutions that want similar strategy exposures into actively-managed funds that
outperform strategy benchmarks by 86 basis points gross, or 42 basis points net of fees. We
trace this outperformance to systematic deviations from the asset-class benchmarks. The
asset manager industry is therefore not just a passive pass-through entity that institutions
use to implement strategy mandates.
A better understanding of delegation is relevant on several dimensions. For example,
Adrian, Etula, and Muir (2014) show that intermediaries, rather than households, price
assets. We provide evidence on the factors that lead institutions to delegate to intermediaries.
Delegation is relevant to the ongoing debate about whether intermediation contributes to
systemic risk (Jopson 2015). We characterize the delegation process and provide evidence
on costs and benefits. There is room for more research on the determinants of asset flows
and the implications of the sector’s size.
Delegation is also relevant for understanding who pays for financial intermediation through
fees and returns. We find that the average intermediated institutional dollar’s return exceeded that of the market by 131 basis points between 2000 and 2012. This estimate implies
that the average non-institutional or non-intermediated dollar—that is, investments made
through retail mutual funds or directly by individuals or institutions—underperformed the
market by 53 basis points even before fees. These estimates add to the debates on intermediary skill and the relative performance of active versus passive management, as well as for
discussions of regulatory oversight of intermediation.

Figure 1: Aggregate fees paid by institutions to asset managers. This figure presents aggregate
fee estimates based on information available in the Consultant’s database. The estimates represent
value-weighted average fees in the Consultant’s database multiplied by total institutional assets under
management. Line “Schedule middle point” assumes that the average dollar in each fund pays the
median fee listed on that fund’s fee schedule and “Schedule lower bound” uses the lowest fee from
each fee schedule. “Implied realized fee” is estimated using data on funds that report returns both
gross and net of fees. We annualize the monthly return di↵erence, take the value-weighted average,
and then re-weight asset classes so that each asset class’s weight matches that in the full database.
The numbers on y-axis to the right are the aggregate fee estimates for 2012. The numbers within the
figure represent the average annual fees over the sample period for the three sets of estimates.

This table presents descriptive statistics for the Pensions & Investments surveys, our estimates of worldwide investable assets,
and the Consultant’s database. For descriptions of the Pensions & Investments surveys and our estimates of worldwide investable
assets, see the Appendix. The Consultant’s data cover the period 2000–2012.

Table 1: Assets under management ($ in billions)

Table 2: Selection bias tests
This table examines the relation between performance and selective coverage in the Consultant’s
database. Coverage is the percentage of assets under management that the manager reports to the
Consultant’s database. Internal coverage is the percentage of assets under management for which the
manager reports the returns on the underlying strategies. We report estimates from ordinary least
squares panel regressions of percentage returns on the coverage measures. The unit of observation is a
fund-month with N = 1,226,824. Standard errors are clustered by 32,165 month-by-strategy clusters.
A coefficient estimate of 0.001 indicates that a percentage point increase in coverage is associated with
a 0.1 basis point per month increase in returns.

Table 3: Summary of fund characteristics by asset class
This table presents descriptive statistics for the funds in the Consultant’s database. Panel A reports
the number of managers and funds, the average fund age, and the average AUM for all funds. In
Panel B, we calculate each month the distributions of assets, client counts, and AUM per client for
each fund and then report the time series averages of these distributions. Total assets and assets per
client are in $ millions. The Consultant’s data cover the period from January 2000 through June 2012.

Table 4: Fees by asset class and client size
This table presents descriptive statistics for the fee data in the Consultant’s database. Panel A reports
the distributions of fund fees across all asset classes and by asset class. The fees reported in this table
are the middle point fees reported on each fund’s fee schedule. Panel B sorts funds based on the assets
under management per client and reports the fee distributions for seven categories that range from
less than one million dollars in assets per client to over one billion dollars in assets per client. The
fees are computed using data on a total of 12,811 asset manager funds. The number of funds in the
average month is 4,715.

Table 5: Fund returns
This table compares fund returns against broad asset-class benchmarks. Panel A reports marketadjusted returns, which are computed by subtracting from each fund’s gross or net return the broad
asset-class level benchmark return. These four benchmarks are listed in Table A3. Panel B presents
the annual gross alphas and weights against the asset-class level benchmarks. We define for each
B , where r B is the return on the broad asset class or
fund i and month t a residual eit = rit rit
it
strategy. We then estimate a value-weighted panel regression of these residuals against a constant,
clustering the errors by month. The weights in this regression are proportional to each fund’s assets
under management and they are scaled to sum up to one within each month. Tracking error estimates
are obtained from value-weighted regressions of e2it s on a constant. Alphas and tracking errors are
annualized. Information ratio (IR) is the annualized net alpha divided by the tracking error. The
Consultant’s data cover the period from January 2000 through June 2012.

Table 6: Evaluating fund returns against broad market indexes
This table presents gross and net alphas from single-factor models that use the four broad asset class
benchmarks listed in Table A3. We first estimate fund-by-fund regressions of net and gross returns
against benchmarks and collect eit = ↵
ˆ i + "ˆit . We then estimate value-weighted panel regressions
of these residuals against a constant, clustering the standard errors by month. The weights in this
regression are proportional to each fund’s assets under management and they are scaled to sum up
to one within each month. Betas and R2 s reported are obtained by estimating similar value-weighted
regressions with the fund-specific betas and R2 s as the dependent variables. Tracking error estimates
are obtained from value-weighted regressions of e2it s on a constant. Alphas and tracking errors are
annualized. Information ratio (IR) is the annualized net alpha divided by the tracking error. The
Consultant’s data cover the period from January 2000 through June 2012.

This table presents gross and net alphas from single-factor models that use the 170 strategies listed
in Table A5. Panel A reports the estimates by asset class. Panel B reports estimates based on
alternative samples for robustness. The first row in Panel B limits the sample to funds for which the
manager entered no more than one year of historical data at the initiation of coverage. The second
row presents results for the post-2006 data and the third row limits the sample to asset managers
that report performance for funds that represent at least 85% of their total assets under management.

Table 8: Mutual fund-benchmarked gross and net returns
This table compares the performance of asset manager funds with the performance of mutual funds.
For each asset manager fund, we use the CRSP classification codes to identify all mutual funds that
follow the same strategy. We then compute the value-weighted return series of these mutual funds
using the CRSP survivorship-bias free database. The table reports the di↵erences between the value
weighted gross and net returns earned by asset manager funds and mutual funds.

Table 10: Sharpe analysis
This table reports estimates from an analysis that compares fund returns with returns on mimicking
portfolios constructed from 15 tactical factors. We implement this analysis using a modified version
of Sharpe’s (1992) approach. For each fund i-month t, we regress the strategy returns against 15
tactical factors using data up to month t 1. The first tactical factor is the strategy’s broad asset
class benchmark listed in Table A3. The remaining 14 tactical factors, which are listed in Panel A,
are common across strategies. The regression slopes are constrained to be non-negative and to sum
up to one. We use the resulting slope estimates to compute the return on strategy i’s style portfolio
B , where r B is the return on the style portfolio. We then
in month t and define a residual eit = rit rit
it
estimate a value-weighted panel regression of these residuals against a constant, clustering the errors
by month. The weights in this regression are proportional to each fund’s assets under management
and they are scaled to sum up to one within each month. Panel A reports the average weights by
asset class. Panel B reports gross and net alphas, tracking errors, and information ratios for the funds
by asset class. The tracking error and Sharpe weight estimates are obtained from value-weighted
regressions of e2it s and the first-stage weights on a constant. The Consultant’s data cover the period
from January 2000 through June 2012.

Table 11: Regressions of fees on style-portfolio and residual returns
This table presents regressions that measure the relation between before-fee performance and fees.
The unit of observation is a month-fund pair. We report estimates from regressions of monthly fees
(⇥100) on the return on the style portfolio and the residual return. These return-component estimates
are from Table 10’s Sharpe analysis. Panel A presents panel regressions with monthly returns. These
regressions include month-asset class fixed e↵ects and standard errors are clustered at the fund-level.
Panel B presents cross sectional regressions with one observation per fund. We generate each fund’s
observation by first running panel regressions of style return and the residual return on month-asset
class fixed e↵ects. The residuals from these regressions represent abnormal performance after removing
variation across asset classes and months. For each fund, we then take averages of these adjusted style
and residual returns. The Consultant’s data cover the period from January 2000 through June 2012.

Table 12: Replicating asset managers
This table reports Sharpe ratios of alternative portfolios constructed from tradeable indexes listed
in Table 7. The first method uses the standard mean-variance optimization algorithm of Markowitz
(1952). The second method first diagonalizes the covariance matrix and constrains the estimated
risk premiums to be nonnegative. The third method imposes short-sale constraints. We estimate
the means and covariances using all available historical data for each index up to month t 1. We
construct the replicating portfolio separately within each asset class, and then use these weights
together with the asset-class weights observed in the asset-manager data to compute the return on
the replicating portfolio in month t. Panel A reports the Sharpe ratios of asset managers and these
replicating portfolios. Column Indi↵erence cost equates the Sharpe ratio of the replicating portfolio
with the asset managers’ Sharpe ratio. Panel B reports the cost of holding the replicating portfolio,
constructed using the diagonal-covariance method, using four alternative assumptions about fees. The
detailed fees are reported in Panel C. Expense ratios and fees are reported in basis points. Entries of
“NA” denote that the data are not available.

Appendix
In this Appendix, we describe the methodology that we use to estimate worldwide investable assets
and total institutional assets held by asset managers.

Worldwide investable assets
We estimate total worldwide investable assets, which represent the sum of six broad investable asset
classes: real estate, outstanding government bonds, outstanding bonds issued by banks and financial
corporations, outstanding bonds issued by non-financial corporations, private equity, and public equity.
For real estate, we estimate the worldwide value of commercial real estate. To do so, we follow
the methodology used by Prudential Real Estate Investors (PREI) in the report “A Bird’s Eye View
of Global Real Estate Markets: 2010 Update.” Their methodology uses GDP per capita to capture
country-level economic development and estimates the size of a country’s commercial real estate market
based on GDP. They select a time-varying threshold and assume that the value of commercial real
estate above this threshold is 45% of total GDP. The threshold starts in 2000 at $20,000 in per capita
GDP and then adjusts annually by the U.S. inflation rate. For countries with per capita GDP below
the threshold in a given year, PREI calculates the value of the country’s commercial real estate market
as:
Value of commercial real estate = 45% ⇥ GDP ⇥ (GDP per capita / Threshold)1/3 .
To estimate the worldwide size of the government, financial, and corporate bond sectors, we use
the Bank for International Settlements’ debt securities statistics provided in Table 18 of the Bank’s
Quarterly Reviews. These statistics present total debt securities by both residence of issuer and
classification of user (non-financial corporations, general government, and financial corporations).1 We
then aggregate the country-level data by year. For private equity, we use Preqin’s “2014 Private Equity
Performance Monitor Report,” which provides annual estimates of assets under management held by
private equity funds worldwide and these estimates include both cash held by funds (“dry powder”)
and unrealized portfolio values. For our estimates of the size of world’s public equity markets, we use
the World Bank’s estimates of the market capitalization of listed companies.2
Table A1 presents annual estimates of worldwide investable assets by the six broad asset classes.
Our estimate of worldwide investable assets for 2012 is $173 trillion. For comparison, if we extrapolate
Philippon’s (2015) estimates of U.S. investable assets, we obtain a similar estimate of $175 trillion in
worldwide investable assets for 2012.

Total institutional assets held by asset managers
In our analysis, we supplement the Consultant’s database with data from Pensions & Investments
Magazine, which implements annual surveys of the asset management industry. In this subsection, we
describe the Pensions & Investments surveys and how we use the surveys to construct our estimates of
total institutional assets under management held worldwide by asset managers, which are presented
in the first column of Panel A of Table 1.
We use two Pensions & Investments surveys. The first survey is the Pensions & Investments
Towers Watson World 500, which is an annual survey of the assets under management (retail and

institutional) held by the world’s 500 largest money managers. The second survey is the Pensions
& Investments Money Manager Directory, which provides more detailed data for U.S. based money
managers including total assets under management, institutional assets under management, and broad
asset allocations (equity, fixed income, cash, and other) for U.S. tax exempt institutional assets.
Table A2 provides descriptive statistics for these surveys and describes how we construct our estimate of total worldwide institutional assets held by asset managers. Column (1) presents annual
total worldwide assets under management (retail and institutional assets) based on the Pensions &
Investments Towers Watson World 500 survey and column (2) presents total assets under management (retail and institutional assets) for the U.S. based asset managers covered in the Pensions &
Investments Money Manager Directory survey. The totals presented in these two columns include
both retail and institutional assets. In column (3), we therefore present total institutional assets held
by U.S. based asset managers. As shown in column (4), over the sample period, institutional assets
held by U.S. based asset managers range from 63% to 69% of total assets.
To estimate the worldwide size of the institutional segment, we extrapolate based on the institutional asset percentages for the U.S. based asset managers. We first create a union of managers who
show up on either the Pensions & Investments Towers Watson 500 survey or the Pensions & Investments Money Manager Directory survey.3 Column (5) presents total assets under management (retail
and institutional) for the managers in the union of the two surveys. These totals are very close to the
totals based on the Towers Watson 500 survey, implying that the top 500 managers control the vast
majority of assets. We next scale the total assets presented in column (5) by the percent institutional
assets held by U.S. based managers presented in column (4). Column (6) presents these estimates of
worldwide institutional assets under management. We present these estimates in the first column of
Panel A of Table 1.

Missing in this union are non-U.S. based asset managers who are smaller than the cuto↵ for the Pensions & Investments Towers Watson World 500. Given the close estimates of the top 500 with the intersection with U.S. based
managers, this missing category does not appear large.

This table presents how we estimate total institutional assets held by asset managers. To do so, we use two Pensions & Investments
surveys: Towers Watson and the Money Manager Directory. Towers Watson provides the total assets under management (retail and
institutional) held by the world’s 500 largest asset managers, which are presented in the first column. The Money Manager Directory
provides total assets under management (retail and institutional) and institutional assets under management for U.S. asset managers,
which are presented in the second and third columns. We create a union of these two surveys and then use the ratio institutional to total
assets for U.S. asset managers to extrapolate total worldwide institutional assets held by asset managers, which is presented in the last
column.

Table A4: Sharpe analysis: Alternative specifications
This table reports estimates from an analysis that compares fund returns with returns on mimicking
portfolios constructed from 15 tactical factors. In Table 10, we construct the style portfolio by using
data for all months except month t. Panel A in this table constructs the style portfolio using data
that exclude six months both before and after month t. Panel B constructs the style portfolio using
data only up to month t 1. We report gross and net alphas, tracking errors, and information ratios
for the funds by asset class.
