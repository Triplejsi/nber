Evaluating Post-Secondary Aid: Enrollment, Persistence, and Projected Completion Effects

ABSTRACT
This paper reports updated findings from a randomized evaluation of a generous, privatelyfunded scholarship program for Nebraska public college students. Scholarship offers boosted
college enrollment and persistence. Four years after award receipt, randomly-selected scholarship
winners were 13 percentage points more likely to be enrolled in college. Enrollment effects were
larger for groups with historically low college attendance, including nonwhite students, firstgeneration college-goers, and students with low high school GPAs. Scholarships shifted many
students from two- to four-year colleges, reducing associate’s degree completion in the process.
Despite their substantial gains in four-year college enrollment, award winners from the first study
cohort were slightly less likely to graduate on time than control applicants, suggesting that
scholarships delay degree completion for some students. Projected graduation rates using the last
cohort of pre-experimental scholarship applicants indicate that scholarships are likely to increase
bachelor’s degree completion within five years.

Introduction
The Susan Thompson Bu↵ett Foundation (STBF) o↵ers scholarships to Nebraska high school

graduates who attend the state’s public colleges and universities. STBF is one of the largest private
grant providers in the country, funding more than 4,000 students with $36 million in aid every year.
Its awards are generous: the largest STBF awards provide more than $70,000 toward five years
of study at Nebraska public institutions. The Foundation selects award winners on the basis of
financial need, high school GPA, and a review of personal statements and reference letters. STBF
aid recipients, known as Bu↵ett Scholars, can use their awards to cover costs at any University of
Nebraska (NU) or State College campus, along with any of the state’s six community colleges. Buffett Scholars who attend one of the three NU campuses also participate in Learning Communities
(LCs), a Foundation-supported academic services intervention similar to other Learning Communities programs around the country.1
To measure the impacts of grant aid and Learning Community services, we implemented a large
randomized evaluation of the STBF program. Between 2012 and 2016, STBF awarded more than
3,700 of its scholarships via random assignment. Our earlier working paper (Angrist et al. 2014)
reports award e↵ects on college enrollment and sophomore persistence for the first two experimental
cohorts of students, who started college in the fall of 2012 and 2013. The results reported here add
two new cohorts (2014 and 2015) and follow the 2012 applicants through their fourth post-award
academic year. The latest data allow us to measure initial college completion e↵ects and investigate
enrollment and persistence with much greater precision.
The new results reinforce our earlier findings that STBF scholarships alter students’ enrollment
behavior. Awards o↵ered to high school seniors who planned to attend community colleges boosted
initial enrollment by five percentage points and dramatically increased transfers to bachelor’s degreegranting institutions over time. Four years after award receipt, community college scholarship
winners from the first cohort were 50 percent more likely to be enrolled at post-secondary institutions
than students not o↵ered Bu↵ett aid. Awards o↵ered to students who aspired to attend four-year
colleges had smaller e↵ects on initial enrollment since 96 percent of control students in this group

enrolled in college. Still scholarships boosted their initial enrollment by three points, a gain that
increased to 13 points by the end of senior year.
The large and heterogeneous STBF applicant pool reveals important variation in aid e↵ects
across subgroups. Retention increased most among groups with high expected dropout rates in the
absence of treatment: nonwhite applicants, first-generation college-goers, and students with low
high school GPAs. On the whole, STBF scholarships substantially reduced persistence gaps across
demographic groups.
To distinguish the e↵ects of STBF’s financial aid from those of LC services, we randomly o↵ered
some applicants an aid-only treatment that excluded access to LCs. This treatment, known to
applicants as the College Opportunity Scholarship (COS), o↵ered financial support to NU applicants
in the same amounts and under the same conditions as full STBF awards but without o↵ering seats
in the Foundation-sponsored LC programs at NU campuses. Aid-only awards generated average
enrollment gains on par with the combination aid and LC treatment. However, the combination
treatment — aid plus Learning Community support — appears more e↵ective than aid alone for
students with lower high school GPAs.
Although STBF awards generated clear and impressive enrollment gains, the picture for degree
completion remains unclear. Awards shifted community-college-bound students to four-year schools
without increasing associate’s degrees in the process. Roughly half of all control applicants in the
2012 community-college-bound group earned associate’s degrees within four years of high school
graduation. The associate’s degree completion rate was 12 points lower among scholarship recipients
in this group, an imprecisely estimated e↵ect. Scholarship winners who targeted four-year schools
were also less likely to complete bachelor’s degrees within four years than were control students.
Though on-time graduation rates were low — less than 30 percent — for both groups, scholarship
support further delayed completion. A likely explanation for this pattern is that STBF scholarships
fund up to five years of study, thereby decreasing financial pressure for on-time completion. Despite
the initial delays, we project that scholarships will ultimately increase bachelor’s degree completion
using data from an earlier cohort of non-randomized scholarship applicants.
The next section briefly reviews STBF program parameters and the design of our ongoing
experiment. Section 3 discusses the scholarships’ e↵ects on students’ financial aid packages. Section
4 reports reduced-form estimates of award e↵ects on enrollment for students targeting two- and four2

year colleges, including e↵ects in key demographic subgroups. Section 5 presents provisional results
from the aid-only treatment arm, and Section 6 discusses preliminary e↵ects on degree completion.
Section 7 concludes by summarizing the findings to date and briefly discussing our work in progress.

Background

2.1

The STBF Scholarship Program

The Susan Thompson Bu↵ett Foundation is the largest private grant provider in Nebraska and
among the largest in the country, supporting more than 4,000 students with $36 million each year.
STBF scholarships are available to Nebraska-resident high school seniors and graduates of in-state
high schools who have not yet been to college. The program is widely known in Nebraska and
well-publicized to potential applicants. More than half of all Pell-eligible Nebraska seniors who file
for federal aid also apply for Bu↵ett grants.2
STBF award criteria combine the academic standards of many state aid programs with the
means testing of federal student aid. Eligible applicants must attain a 2.5 high school GPA and
document financial need using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). STBF gauges
financial need using FAFSA’s Expected Family Contribution (EFC) metric, which depends chiefly
on family size and income.3 The maximum Bu↵ett-eligible EFC— $15,000 in 2012 and $10,000
thereafter4 — exceeds the federal Pell Grant cuto↵, which ranged from $5,000 to $5,300 between
2012 and 2015. Bu↵ett awards are therefore available to many students who do not qualify for
federal grants or other state-funded programs tied to Pell receipt.
Within the pool of eligible applicants, STBF’s merit assessment is more fine-grained than most
state programs, incorporating transcripts, essays, and reference letters. Students submit their
application materials online between November 1 and February 1, with FAFSA records due by
March 15. Reviewers then evaluate eligible applicants using a rubric that emphasizes academic
achievement, financial need, and leadership skills. STBF notifies award winners in mid-April, and
more than 94 percent of scholarship winners accept their awards.

Dynarski and Scott-Clayton (2007) provide further detail on the FAFSA and EFC formula.
4
Less than eight percent of the 2012 randomized sample had EFCs greater than $10,000, so the 2013 change in
eligibility requirements had little impact on the EFC distribution across cohorts.

Bu↵ett awards can be used to cover expenses at any public undergraduate institution in Nebraska, including two- and four-year colleges. Award amounts vary by campus but are calibrated
to match the cost of tuition and fees for a full-time student plus a $500 allotment for books. In
2015, for example, awards provided up to $8,700 per academic year for full-time students at the
University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where full-time resident tuition and fees were $8,382 (University
of Nebraska-Lincoln 2015). STBF provides an additional semester’s worth of funding for summer
enrollment so that the maximum 2015 award was $13,050 at the University of Nebraska and $5,700
at community colleges. Though tuition levels determine the value of Bu↵ett grants, the funds can
be used to cover any of the federally-defined components of cost-of-attendance (COA), including
room, board, books, and supplies. This flexibility boosts STBF’s scholarship value relative to aid
programs that cover only tuition and fees. Because most Bu↵ett Scholars also qualify for state and
federal tuition grants, STBF aid often covers the remaining balance of COA, eliminating the need
for loans and out-of-pocket contributions to college costs. Bu↵ett awards are renewable for up to
five years provided students meet minimal academic requirements, though no more than three years
of funding can be paid toward community college expenses. Students enrolled for fewer than nine
credits per semester or with cumulative GPAs below 2.0 risk losing their scholarships.
Bu↵ett Scholars who attend one of NU’s three campuses—Lincoln (UNL), Omaha (UNO), or
Kearney (UNK)—are required to participate in STBF-funded Learning Community (LC) programs
during their first and second years.5 These programs are designed to promote academic success
and social engagement. While the LC programs di↵er somewhat by campus, they all include
special classes for Bu↵ett Scholars, a collection of academic and social activities, peer mentoring,
and academic advising services from LC faculty and sta↵. Most participants in the LC programs
at UNK and UNL live in dedicated dorm space. Bu↵ett Scholars who fail to participate in LC
activities may also lose their scholarships.

2.2

Research Design and Sample Construction

From 2012 to 2015, STBF awarded the majority of its scholarships via stratified random assignment. The Foundation divided students into strata by their “target college,” the institution
5

The STBF-sponsored Thompson Learning Community program is named in honor of William H. Thompson, the
father of Susan T. Bu↵ett, who served as Professor of Psychology and Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at
Omaha University, now known as the University of Nebraska Omaha (UNO).

where applicants indicated they would enroll if o↵ered awards. Award winners were not required
to follow their stated plans, but 87 percent of aid recipients did indeed attend their target schools.
Within each target college stratum, STBF further divided students into three groups by application
score. Students in the highest-scoring group received guaranteed awards, the middle group was
subject to random assignment, and the lowest-scoring students were disqualified. Score thresholds
and award rates for the randomized group were determined by STBF preferences for award counts
at each campus.6 Appendix Table A1 reports award counts for each target college and cohort. The
Foundation o↵ered roughly 300 guaranteed awards each year, with a relatively stable distribution
of awards across campuses from year to year. Due to increased Foundation outreach, the number of
eligible applicants grew over time and with it the randomized sample, from 999 in the first experimental cohort to 1,878 by the fourth study year.7 In total, 6,183 applicants were subject to random
assignment between 2012 and 2015.8
To distinguish the e↵ects of STBF’s financial aid from those of LC services, we randomly o↵ered
some applicants the aid-only College Opportunity Scholarship (COS). These aid-only awards match
traditional STBF scholarships in financial support but omit access to Bu↵ett LCs. COS awards were
made only to applicants in the NU strata of the randomized sample. Because the COS treatment
arm did not commence until the second year of our study and is smaller than the other experimental
groups, our COS impact estimates are less precise than results for full STBF awards. We exclude
COS recipients from our analysis except in Section 5 where we explicitly analyze the COS treatment.
The earlier experimental cohorts naturally provide a longer follow-up horizon than more recent
cohorts. We report initial enrollment e↵ects for the 2012-2015 cohorts; year two results for the
2012-2014 cohorts; year three impacts for the 2012 and 2013 cohorts; and year four results for the
2012 cohort. E↵ects di↵er little from one cohort to another and cohort pooling increases precision.
Estimated pooled impacts come from regressions that control for a full set of strata dummies to
reflect the di↵erential award rates across target colleges and cohorts. Appendix Table A2 reports
sample sizes for each follow-up period.
6

The primary considerations are historic precedent and physical capacity constraints at the NU Learning Communities.
7
Starting in 2013, STBF advertised the scholarship by sending e-mail and print letters to Nebraska ACT testtakers who reported family incomes less than $100,000. In addition, the Foundation worked with high school guidance
counselors to identify eligible students who were not submitting applications.
8
Here and throughout our analysis, we exclude fewer than 25 students who were less than 17 years old when they
applied for STBF aid.

2.3

Data and Descriptive Statistics

Data for this project come primarily from the STBF scholarship application, the administrative
records of Nebraska’s public colleges, and the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC). The STBF
scholarship application provides a rich set of baseline characteristics, including high school transcripts, ACT scores, and detailed demographic and financial information from federal Student Aid
Reports. Prior to 2014, the application did not ask students to report race, so we obtained race
data from state driver’s license records. We supplement the driver’s license data with self-reported
race in later cohorts.
More than 90 percent of applicants who enrolled in college attended Nebraska public institutions.
These colleges and universities provided information on their students’ enrollment, financial aid
packages, and academic outcomes. To capture enrollment at private and out-of-state colleges,
we supplement school-provided records with data from the NSC, which captures 92 percent of
enrollment nationwide (Dynarski, Hemelt and Hyman 2015). The data appendix provides additional
information about data sources and processing.
STBF applicants are substantially poorer than the general population of Nebraska high school
seniors. This can be seen in the first two columns of Table 1, which compare descriptive statistics
for eligible scholarship applicants and 12th grade students statewide. Bu↵ett applicants are also
disproportionately female and nonwhite. Applicants’ ACT scores mirror the average among ACT
test-takers in Nebraska, though test-taking rates among STBF’s college-bound applicants exceed
the state average.
Consistent with STBF’s scoring criteria, the guaranteed award winners have higher grades and
ACT scores and lower family incomes than the rest of the applicant pool, results that can be seen
in column 3 of Table 1. Nearly half are nonwhite, and half are first-generation college students. At
the other end of the rankings, students disqualified before random assignment had lower academic
achievement but otherwise look similar to the eligible sample.
Randomized students had average annual family incomes near $47,000 and Expected Family
Contributions just under $3,000. They are slightly over two-thirds white, 62 percent female, and
averaged B+ grades in high school. Just over one in three had a parent with a bachelor’s degree
at the time of application. Random assignment successfully balanced the characteristics of treated

6

and control applicants in the experimental sample, as Table 1 confirms. Column 6 reports strataadjusted di↵erences in treated and control means with standard errors in parentheses.
Our analysis reports results separately for students targeting two- and four-year colleges. These
target college strata are an important feature of the research design and a strong predictor of
enrollment outcomes. As shown in Appendix Table A3, students who target community colleges
have lower grades and test scores and are less likely to have college-educated parents than students
targeting four-year colleges.

How Awards A↵ected Aid
We begin by reviewing award e↵ects on students’ financial aid packages. This analysis is limited

to students who attended Nebraska public colleges because our administrative aid data come from
those institutions. Since STBF awards a↵ect where students enroll and, by extension, their inclusion
in this sample, the analysis here is potentially subject to selection bias. In practice, however, the
e↵ect of awards on enrollment at in-state public colleges is small while the e↵ects on financial aid
packages are large.9 Though the picture painted here is, in principle, more descriptive than causal,
it still provides a useful gauge of the scholarships’ impact on financial aid packages.
As a benchmark, the first column of Table 2 describes the first-year financial aid packages of
control group students who attended Nebraska public colleges. They incurred almost $17,000 in
college costs and received about $12,350 in total aid, on average. Even without STBF support,
these low-income students collected nearly $7,800 in grant aid, primarily from need-based public
programs. They also accepted roughly $3,700 in federal loans and $830 in work study wages. These
calculations omit private loans, which are underreported in our data. Subsidized public loans are
the primary source of borrowed funds for this low-income population.
We estimate the e↵ects of scholarship o↵ers on aid packages using regression models of the form:
Ai = Si +

X

sc disc

+ ⇧0 X i + " i ,

(1)

s,c

9

Less than eight percent of control students enrolled at out-of-state or private institutions. Scholarship o↵ers
diverted 3.6 percentage points to Nebraska public colleges. These estimates appear in Table 3, which we discuss in
greater detail in Section 4.

7

where Ai is the dollar amount of aid that student i received, and Si is an indicator for whether
student i was (randomly) o↵ered an STBF scholarship. Since a few students in each cohort turn
down Bu↵ett grants for other merit aid, these estimates capture intent-to-treat contrasts between
treated and control subjects. The dummies disc indicate whether applicant i from cohort c listed
school s as her target college. These strata e↵ects adjust for di↵erential award rates by target college
and application year. The covariate vector Xi includes GPA, EFC, gender, race, and parental
education. To the extent that selection into Nebraska public colleges varies with these traits,
including Xi mitigates the resulting selection bias. In practice, however, controlling for covariates
has little e↵ect on the estimates.
STBF award winners received $7,156 in Bu↵ett grants, on average, during their first post-award
year, as shown in column 2 of Table 2, which reports estimates controlling only for strata dummies,
disc . On net, total grants increased by slightly less ($6,209). The less than one-for-one pass-through
reflects a $951 decline in institutional awards and private grants with little change in state or federal
grants.10
STBF aid substantially reduced students’ reliance on federal loans and work study wages. Average federal loans fell by $2,292, and the share of students accruing any federal debt dropped from
57 to 30 percent. Less than one in five award winners received Federal Work Study, compared with
one in three control students. In total, Bu↵ett Scholarship o↵ers increased first-year aid packages
by $3,497. Column 3 confirms that adding baseline covariates has little impact on these estimates,
bolstering the case that these results capture causal e↵ects despite our data limitations.
To estimate the dollar-for-dollar impact of STBF aid on other funding sources, we replace Si
in equation (1) with the dollar amount of Bu↵ett aid received. The estimates in column 5 of
Table 2 show that each dollar of STBF grant aid increased students’ total grants by $0.85, while
reducing loans by $0.29 and work study by $0.05, for a net gain of $0.51 per dollar awarded. These
results capture two countervailing forces. At any given college, scholarship money crowds out aid
from other sources, reducing award e↵ects on total aid disbursed. But awards also change where
students enroll. In particular, as we explore in detail in Section 4, STBF awards caused many
applicants to attend four-year schools instead of less costly community colleges. The first row of
10

Schools must apply federal grants toward aid packages before all other sources, so federal grants do not typically
respond to variation in private aid received.

8

Table 2 documents this shift: every dollar of Bu↵ett aid increased average costs of attendance by
$0.29. Though four-year colleges cost more, they also provide more grant aid. Control students
attending four-year colleges received $9,114 in grants, on average, more than double the average
grant aid among control students at two-year schools. Scholarship money therefore “crowds in” aid
by shifting students to more expensive schools that o↵er more financial aid.
To disentangle the crowd-out and crowd-in e↵ects, columns 4 and 6 of Table 2 (labeled “campus
adjusted”) report estimates from a version of equation (1) that includes campus controls, a set of
variables which count the number of full-time semesters attended at each campus in the first postaward year. These campus-adjusted regressions measure the extent to which Bu↵ett aid crowds out
other funding at a given school. Holding enrollment behavior constant, Bu↵ett aid has no e↵ect
on year one costs incurred, and yet each Bu↵ett dollar reduces other grant aid by $0.29, an e↵ect
that’s nearly twice as large as the crowd out estimated without campus controls.11 These results
should be interpreted cautiously, since campus-adjusted regressions combine causal e↵ects on aid
packages for students whose enrollment is invariant to award o↵ers with compositional e↵ects that
result from treatment-induced changes in college attended. Nevertheless, the observable covariates
have little e↵ect on these estimates. The campus-controlled estimates therefore provide reasonable
evidence that Bu↵ett awards dramatically increase students’ financial resources.

4

Enrollment E↵ects
Because students targeting two- and four-year colleges have such distinct paths through college,

we analyze the scholarships’ e↵ects on these groups separately, in Sections 4.1 and 4.2. After
presenting the aggregate award impacts by target college, we analyze the di↵erential e↵ects of
awards across demographic subgroups in Section 4.3.

4.1

Enrollment E↵ects in the Two-Year College Strata

Almost all STBF applicants attend college in the first year after high school whether or not they
win Bu↵ett awards. This fact is apparent in Figure 1, which plots enrollment rates by treatment
11
The crowd-out rate for total grants was similar in year two ($0.25) and year three ($0.24), which indicates that
STBF scholarships maintain their value as students progress in school. Other aid programs often shift students from
grant aid to loans after the freshman year (Sharpe 2016).

9

status and target college. Even without Bu↵ett aid, 90 percent of control applicants who targeted
community colleges enrolled at some institution in the fall of year one,12 as the grey line in Panel
A indicates. STBF awards increased initial enrollment in this group by a statistically significant
five percentage points. This estimate and others in Figure 1 come from regressions of binary
enrollment indicators on the award o↵er and strata dummies described in equation (1), though
unlike the financial aid analysis, these regressions include all randomized applicants in the two-year
college strata, not just those who enrolled at Nebraska public colleges. Whiskers indicate 95 percent
confidence intervals for the estimated treatment e↵ects.
Although students in the two-year strata indicated that they aspired to attend community
colleges, some opted to enroll at four-year schools after receiving scholarship support. Table 3 documents this shift across institutions. Nearly all of the five point increase in total enrollment, shown
in the first row of column 4, comes from increased enrollment at four-year colleges. Admissions
records from the University of Nebraska reveal that many of the students who altered their stated
college plans didn’t apply to four-year schools until after receiving Bu↵ett aid. Award o↵ers boosted
applications to UNO, for example, from eight to 13 percent in the two-year strata, as Appendix
Table A4 reports. Scholarship winners were no more likely to be admitted conditional on applying,
however; UNO admitted 77 percent of both treated and control applicants from the two-year college
strata.13 The mechanism that motivates some Bu↵ett Scholars to alter their college plans is yet unknown. Award winners may interpret scholarship o↵ers as positive signals of their college aptitude
and revise their enrollment goals. Another explanation is financial: STBF’s award scheme implicitly
subsidizes shifting from two- to four-year schools since awards cover tuition at any Nebraska public
college, and four-year schools are more expensive — both in total and on a per-credit basis.
Like many state aid programs, Bu↵ett awards diverted some enrollment from out-of-state and
private schools into Nebraska public colleges, though there was little scope for shifting on this
margin in the two-year strata. Just four percent of control students enrolled outside the Nebraska
12

In keeping with the the Federal Student Aid year, we define post-award years to run from July 1 through June
30. We divide each post-award year into fall and spring periods, where fall runs from July through December, and
spring runs from January through June.
13
It’s unlikely that scholarship applicants who intend to enroll at UNO misreport their college plans to increase
their chances of winning Bu↵ett awards. The average award rate was 47 percent for the two-year strata and 54 percent
for UNO, as the sample counts in Appendix Table A1 indicate. We are still working to collect admissions records
from UNL, the most selective NU campus. However, the vast majority of two-year strata students who matriculate at
four-year schools attend UNO, owing, perhaps, to its rolling admission deadlines and proximity to Nebraska’s largest
community college.

10

public college system, and awards reduced that rate to two percent, as shown in Panel B of Table
3.
Both treatment and control group enrollment declined modestly during the second follow-up
year, but thereafter these groups’ enrollment paths diverged. Many control students left school
during year three, and by year four fall, just 28 percent were still enrolled in college. Though
dropout also accelerated in the treated pool, Bu↵ett awardees were nearly twice as likely to extend
their studies beyond three years: more than half enrolled in the fall of year four. Panel A of Figure
1 plots these trends, and Table 4 reports the corresponding estimates.14
Award winners’ extended enrollment came at the expense of associate’s degree completion. This
result appears in the last two columns of Table 4, which disaggregates year-four enrollment by degree
status. The top row reports the total enrollment rate: 28 percent of control applicants enrolled in
the fall of year four, and 72 percent did not. Roughly half of those not enrolled earned associate’s
degrees before leaving school. Treated students, in contrast, were 21 points less likely to complete
terminal associate’s degrees. Instead, many treated applicants transferred to four-year schools
without first earning two-year credentials: award o↵ers increased the share of students attending
four-year institutions without any degree from 8.5 to 20 points. STBF’s continuation requirements
may encourage these transfers because awards only cover three years of study at community colleges.
Students who wish to maintain their scholarships must therefore transfer to four-year colleges by the
fall of year four. The point estimate indicates that scholarships may have decreased the number of
students who dropped out before completing any degree (by 5.4 percentage points), but this figure
is imprecisely estimated.

4.2

Enrollment E↵ects in the Four-Year Strata

STBF applicants who targeted four-year schools were even more likely to enroll in college than
their two-year strata counterparts, even without Foundation support. More than 96 percent of
control applicants attended college in the fall of year one, and awards boosted this rate by a
statistically significant three percentage points. Panel B of Figure 1 plots these enrollment rates.
14
Because the results for initial enrollment pool data from all four cohorts, they are more precisely estimated than
the impacts on longer-run enrollment. Appendix Table A5 shows that the underlying cohort-specific enrollment rates
are not significantly di↵erent from the pooled estimates in Figure 1.

11

Students in the four-year strata also applied to a wider range of institutions than their community college-bound peers, so awards had more scope to influence these students’ college choice.
Scholarship o↵ers decreased the fraction of students attending out-of-state or private schools from
eight to four percent, as columns 5 and 6 of Table 3 report. Importantly, however, and in contrast
with other state merit aid programs (see Cohodes and Goodman 2014), the shift to Nebraska public
schools was concomitant with a shift toward more-selective institutions. Specifically, STBF awards
increased the proportion of students attending selective colleges (with admission rates below 75
percent) by four points. The fraction of students attending moderately-selective four-year schools
(with admissions rates between 75 and 90 percent) increased by a similar amount. At the same
time, awards reduced the share attending community colleges from nine to three percent.15
Though scholarships had only modest e↵ects on initial enrollment in the four-year strata, awards
substantially reduced dropout in the critical transition between freshman and sophomore years.
Nearly half of all dropout from bachelor’s degree programs occurs at this juncture (Kena et al.
2015).16 In STBF’s relatively high-achieving applicant pool, scholarship o↵ers boosted sophomore
enrollment by seven points, ensuring that 96 percent of treated students enrolled in year two. The
impact on four-year college going was even larger: STBF awards increased four-year enrollment
by 13 points in year two fall. These results appear in column 4 of Table 5, which documents
institutional shifting in the four-year strata in a format similar to Table 4.
Importantly, while many interventions produce short-lived gains, STBF award impacts appear
to be cumulative. By the fall of year four, awards increased total enrollment by 14 points, from
74 to 88 percent. Nearly all students were attending bachelor’s degree-granting institutions by the
fourth follow-up year. Less than 10 percent of both treated and control students were still enrolled
at two-year institutions.
15
Most STBF applicants who enrolled outside the Nebraska public college system attended private schools in the
Midwest. The top five schools attended outside the Nebraska public college system were Nebraska Wesleyan University,
Creighton University, Hastings College, Concordia University, and Midland University, all religiously-affiliated private
institutions in Nebraska.
16
Just 80 percent of all first-time, full-time undergraduates at bachelor’s degree-granting institutions return for a
second year, while 60 percent complete bachelor’s degrees within six years. Freshman retention rates at the University
of Nebraska hover near the national average, ranging from 77 percent at UNO to 84 percent at UNL in 2014 (U.S.
Department of Education 2014).

Subgroup Impacts: Race, Family Background, and College-Preparedness

Within the four-year strata, STBF awards generated especially large enrollment gains for demographic groups with high expected dropout rates in the absence of treatment.17 Figure 2 documents
this variation in program impacts by race and parental education, both strong predictors of enrollment and retention. Nonwhites in the control group were less likely to attend college than were
their white peers. More than 98 percent of white applicants enrolled without Foundation support
compared with 94 percent of nonwhite students. Award o↵ers equalized their initial enrollment so
that more than 99 percent of award winners from both groups attended college in year one. Four
years out, awards narrowed the race gap in enrollment from twelve points to just seven. Panels C
and D document a similar pattern by parental education.
Figure 3 reveals even more striking patterns in program impacts by academic preparation.
The dots in Panels A and B show estimated impacts on year-two fall enrollment for deciles of
high school GPA, and the solid lines plot fitted values from regressions that estimate the linear
interaction between award status and GPA. Dashed lines plot 95 percent confidence intervals for
the linear fitted values. Panel A shows that award o↵ers boosted year-two enrollment by 23 points
in the bottom decile, from 74 to 97 percent. These students, with average high school GPAs of 2.7,
would be ineligible for many state merit aid programs, which often require GPAs of 3.0 (Fitzpatrick
and Jones 2016). At the same time, scholarships had almost no measurable impact on persistence
for the top-performing students who receive most merit aid. Among students with high school
GPAs above 3.5—fully half the randomized sample—awards increased year-two fall enrollment by
just three points.18 The GPA gradient for award impacts on four-year college enrollment was even
more pronounced, as Panel B illustrates. Scholarships increased the share of bottom-decile students
attending four-year schools in sophomore year by a whopping 40 points, with no e↵ect at the top
end of the grade distribution. Appendix Figure A1 documents similar patterns using ACT scores to
measure college readiness in lieu of high school GPA. These results are consistent with Dynarski’s
17

We restrict our subgroup analyses to students who targeted four-year colleges since the community college sample
is currently too small to support precise comparisons across subgroups. In time, additional cohorts will facilitate
similar investigations in the two-year strata.
18
Appendix Table A6 compares OLS and logit estimates of e↵ects in subgroups. Logit marginal e↵ects are virtually
indistinguishable from the corresponding OLS estimates.

13

(2004) argument that state aid programs with more stringent academic standards may exclude
many of the students who respond most to financial aid.
Though award impacts vary by race, parental education, and academic achievement, we see less
evidence of di↵erential impacts by financial need. Panels C and D of Figure 3 plot award e↵ects by
Expected Family Contribution (EFC), the metric that determines eligibility for STBF grants and
federal aid programs. There is no clear gradient in award impacts by financial need.19 Appendix
Figure A1 documents similar patterns using family income to gauge financial need.
We summarize the variation in award impacts by showing how treatment e↵ects vary with a
single index of expected college enrollment. Such “endogenous stratification” estimates are best
computed using leave-out fitted values, as Abadie, Chingos and West (2013) detail. (Otherwise,
enrollment outcomes are mechanically correlated with predicted enrollment, which may bias estimates of causal e↵ects.) In this case, we use the control group data to estimate the relationship
between outcome Yj and covariates Xj in leave-out samples that omit each observation i:
Yj = ⇡(0

i) Xj

+ "j ; j 6= i.

(2)

The vector Xj contains gender, race, parental education, EFC, and high school GPA — all strong
predictors of enrollment and persistence. The resulting leave-out fitted values are given by
ˆ(0
Ŷi = ⇡

i) Xi .

(3)

Estimates of STBF award e↵ects conditional on expected enrollment, Ŷi , appear in Figure 4.
As in the previous graphs, each dot represents a decile of expected enrollment, and the solid lines
plot the corresponding linear fitted values. Since nearly all control applicants in the four-year strata
enroll in year one, the deciles of expected enrollment range from just .89 to 1. Even so, award o↵ers
increased initial enrollment in the bottom decile by more than 10 points, ensuring that nearly all
scholarship recipients enrolled in college. By year two, baseline covariates predict that roughly one
in four students in the bottom decile would not be enrolled in college absent scholarship support.
Scholarships boosted their enrollment rate by more than 20 points. Award impacts in years three
and four exhibit similar patterns, with enrollment impacts of over 40 percentage points for the
lowest decile by year four.
19
Among applicants with EFCs low enough to qualify for Bu↵ett aid, those with EFCs above $6,000 qualify for
fewer forms of other need-based aid, including federal Pell grants and institutional grants.

14

Together, these subgroup analyses highlight the challenging trade-o↵ between rewarding students’ past achievement and increasing program impacts. Students who appear most meritorious
based on grades and test scores are also those most likely to persist in college absent scholarship
support. Conversely, applicants who appear more likely to struggle in college respond more dramatically to merit aid when they are fortunate enough to receive it.

5

Distinguishing Financial Aid and Learning Community E↵ects
Roughly 80 percent of scholarship winners in the four-year strata enroll at University of Ne-

braska campuses, where Bu↵ett Scholars participate in STBF Learning Communities (LCs) during
freshman and sophomore years. Award impacts in the four-year strata therefore combine the effects of financial support with the e↵ects of LC services.20 An aid-only treatment arm, known to
applicants as the College Opportunity Scholarship (COS), allows us to estimate the marginal e↵ect
of LC participation. COS awards o↵er the same grant support as STBF scholarships but exclude
access to LC services.21 COS awards were introduced in the second experimental cohort and were
only o↵ered in the NU strata; guaranteed award winners and those in the state and community
college strata received full STBF scholarships throughout the study. The COS sample is therefore
much smaller than the sample for the main treatment arm.
Figure 5 o↵ers a preliminary look at enrollment e↵ects for the aid-only scholarships. Averaging
data across all NU campuses, both STBF and COS awards generated positive enrollment gains in
each post-award year (Panel A). Traditional STBF award impacts were marginally higher in all
years, but the gaps were not statistically significant. Panels B-D reveal emerging heterogeneity
across NU campuses. Though imprecise, these estimates suggest that LC services at UNO roughly
double the impact of aid alone. COS grants boosted sophomore enrollment by six percentage points,
less than the 12 point gain from full awards. At UNL and UNK, however, there is no evidence that
LC services increase enrollment rates.
As in all analyses of site-specific treatment e↵ects, it can be difficult to discern whether these
patterns reflect variation in LC service quality across sites or in the populations targeting each
20
Award winners in the community college and four-year state college strata must also participate in LCs if they
enroll at NU as freshmen, though just seven percent exercise that option.
21
The LCs operated at full capacity throughout the study. COS awards increased the total number of scholarship
recipients without reducing LC enrollment.

campus. As Appendix Table A3 details, UNO serves a disproportionate fraction of students with
the biggest documented gains from full awards: racial minorities, first-generation college-goers, and
students with lower grades and test scores. UNL and UNK, in contrast, attract students with higher
expected retention in the absence of treatment. The variation in Figure 5 may therefore capture
heterogeneity across students rather than across campuses. Indeed, Figure 6 shows that splitting the
sample by high school GPA instead of campus shows no di↵erential impacts for students with GPAs
at or above the sample median (3.5), but markedly di↵erent, albeit noisy, impacts on students with
below median GPAs. These findings suggest that LC services may boost persistence for students
with lower GPAs despite their small aggregate e↵ects. With additional follow-up data, these results
will become more precise and conclusive.

6

Preliminary and Projected Completion E↵ects
A complete picture of award impacts on bachelor’s degree completion is still one or two years

away. In keeping with nationwide trends, less than one in three students at Nebraska’s four-year
public colleges graduates within four years. After six years, however, graduation rates more than
double, ranging from 37 to 67 percent across Nebraska public institutions. (U.S. Department of
Education 2015).
Like their peers, many Bu↵ett applicants in the oldest randomized cohort were still enrolled
but did not earn bachelor’s degrees by the end of year four. Table 6 summarizes their year-four
graduation rates. In the community college strata, slightly more than half (52 percent) of control
group students earned associate’s degrees by the end of year four. Scholarships decreased this rate
by an insignificant but economically meaningful 12 percentage points. This reduction in associate’s
degrees may ultimately be o↵set by an increase in bachelor’s degrees. Although few students in
the two-year strata have earned bachelor’s degrees to date (5.6 percent in the control group), our
estimates, while imprecise, suggest that scholarships have roughly doubled this number to 11.0
percentage points. Scholarships also increased the share of students enrolled in four-year colleges
who have not yet earned bachelor’s degrees from 15 to 23 percentage points. The total e↵ect
of scholarships on degree completion for this group will depend on how many of these students
eventually complete BAs.

16

Scholarships also decreased degree completion in the four-year strata by the end of year four.
While only five percent of control students earned associate’s degrees by the end of year four, 28
percent completed bachelor’s degrees, as shown in Table 6. Scholarships reduced these completion
rates by 2.4 and 5.9 points, respectively. Bu↵ett Scholars’ lower on-time graduation rates may
reflect the scholarship’s terms. STBF provides up to five years of funding, so award winners likely
face less financial pressure to graduate in four years than other students do. In keeping with this
reasoning, scholarship winners were much more likely to be enrolled in four-year colleges without
earning degrees by the end of year four (57 vs. 39 percentage points).
Results from the 2012 cohort to date show that scholarships have increased the share of students
who are on track to earn bachelor’s degrees while simultaneously depressing the number of degrees
completed in four years. It remains to be seen which of these countervailing forces will dominate
in the long run. To provide a statistical preview of future graduation results, we use data from
the STBF’s 2011 application cohort, the last cohort of students who applied before the experiment
began.22 Though these students were not subject to random assignment, outcomes for successful
and unsuccessful scholarship applicants from this cohort may, in conjunction with our experimental
estimates, be informative about the trajectory of experimental cohorts.
We use Kline’s (2011) selection-correction procedure to adjust for non-random assignment of
award o↵ers in the non-experimental cohort. The Kline method relies on a linear model for potential
outcomes given baseline covariates,
Yid = X0i

d

for d 2 {0, 1}. Under a mean independence assumption,

an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression among the controls identifies

which captures the relationship between covariates and potential outcomes absent scholarship support. If the same mapping from covariates to untreated outcomes holds among award winners, then

As with the subgroup analysis, we restrict the projection estimates to the four-year strata due to power limitations
in the community college strata.

E [Xi | Di = 1]0

.

Kline shows that this hybrid procedure outperforms regression in replicating the experimental e↵ects
of federal job training programs in LaLonde’s (1986) classic analysis.
We find support for the hypothesis that scholarships will ultimately boost bachelor’s degree
completion among students who were randomly assigned scholarships. The top panel of Figure
7 compares estimated e↵ects on bachelor’s degree completion for the 2012 experimental sample
with estimates for the non-randomized 2011 cohort. As in Kline’s replication exercise, selectioncorrected estimates from the non-experimental data faithfully replicate the experimental findings.
The experimental and non-experimental estimates in Panel A are similar through the end of year
four, where both samples show a five to seven point deficit in graduation rates for award winners.
By the end of year five, however, 2011 award winners were eight percentage points more likely to
complete bachelor’s degrees than control applicants. The plotted estimates control for high school
GPA, EFC, gender, race, and parental education, but more parsimonious models produce similar
results.23
To adjust for potential di↵erences in sample composition across cohorts, we reweight the 2011
Kline estimates by the distribution of covariates in the randomized sample and plot the resulting
projections in Panel B. Reweighting leaves the bottom line unchanged. These graphs suggest that
Bu↵ett Scholars eventually convert enrollment gains into bachelor’s degrees even though awards
increase time to completion for some. Experimental estimates of award impacts on five-year graduation rates will be available in the summer of 2017.

Summary and Conclusions
STBF scholarships generated large gains in college enrollment four years after award receipt.

Modest e↵ects on initial enrollment have grown as the scholarship increased college persistence.
Though apparent in our earlier working paper, these patterns have become clearer as the followup window has lengthened and more cohorts have boosted precision. Estimated enrollment gains

remain largest for nonwhite applicants, first-generation college-goers, and students with the lowest
grades and test scores in the eligible applicant pool. These findings highlight the paradox of merit
aid: awards based on past achievement are likely to generate smaller gains than awards made to
applicants who appear less college-ready.
Awards have also shifted students from two- to four-year schools, reducing associate’s degree
completion in the process. The long-run e↵ects of reductions in two-year credentials on terminal
degree completion will likely depend on whether scholarship recipients convert their extended enrollment at four-year institutions into bachelor’s degrees. In the short run, Bu↵ett scholarships
appear to have reduced on-time graduation rates at four-year colleges, likely because these scholarships provide up to five years of funding. Analysis of outcome data from a pre-experimental cohort
suggests that this e↵ect is likely to be transitory: we project that scholarships will raise degree
completion after five years.
Our results are preliminary and limited to the outcomes available within the first four years of
award receipt. As the current cohorts age and new cohorts enter the study, we expect to examine
e↵ects on college completion and sharpen our estimates of di↵erential e↵ects across subgroups.
Evidence on the relative contribution of financial support and Learning Community services should
also grow more conclusive. Ultimately, we expect to measure how award e↵ects on retention and
degree completion influence long-run labor market outcomes.

propensity to enroll in year four fall

Notes: These graphs summarize how award e↵ects on enrollment vary with applicants’ baseline characteristics. The
horizontal axis in each plot is propensity to enroll in the given year as a function of gender, race, parental education,
EFC, and high school GPA, estimated using the leave-one-out fitted values proposed by Abadie, Chingos and West
(2013). Dots plot treatment e↵ect estimates for each decile of expected enrollment, and solid lines plot fitted values
from a regression model that estimates the linear interaction between award status and expected enrollment. Dotted
lines plot 95 percent confidence intervals for the linear fitted values. Samples vary across time horizons as defined in
Figure 1.

Control

Notes: These graphs compare STBF and COS award e↵ects for applicants who targeted University of Nebraska
campuses. Panel A pools all NU randomized applicants, and Panels B-D disaggregate results by target campus.
Grey lines plot enrollment rates for control applicants, blue lines plot the sum of control means and strata-adjusted
treatment e↵ects for traditional STBF scholarship o↵ers, and red lines plot corresponding e↵ects for aid-only COS
awards. Whiskers indicate 95 percent confidence intervals. Samples vary across time horizons as defined in Figure 1.
COS awards were introduced in the second study cohort, so data on COS award winners are only available through
year three.

Notes: The light green lines plot estimated e↵ects of award o↵ers on bachelor’s degree completion in the four-year
college strata for the 2012 experimental cohort. The dark green line in Panel A presents corresponding estimates
from the 2011 non-experimental cohort, the last application cohort before the experiment began. The estimates in
Panel A control for target college, high school GPA, EFC, gender, race, and parental education using Kline’s (2011)
Oaxaca-Blinder procedure. In Panel B, we project graduation rates for the experimental sample by reweighting the
non-experimental Kline estimates using the distribution of covariates in the experimental sample. Whiskers indicate
95 percent confidence intervals.

Notes: This table reports effects of STBF scholarship offers on students' financial aid packages. The sample is
restricted to students in the 2012-2014 applicant cohorts enrolled in Nebraska public colleges. Aid data are currently
unavailable for the 519 students at state colleges and Mid-Plains Community College. Columns 2-4 report results
from regressions of the financial aid awarded in each category on a dummy for winning a scholarship, while columns
5 and 6 report results from regressions of the same dependent variables on the dollar value of STBF scholarships
awarded. The baseline covariates in columns 3-6 are GPA, EFC, gender, race, and parental education. Columns 4 and
6 also control for cumulative enrollment at each campus. Government grants include federal and state grants.
Subsidized government loans are the sum of Perkins and subsidized Stafford loans; unsubsidized government loans
are the sum of PLUS and unsubsidized Stafford loans.

Data Appendix

Application Data
The STBF scholarship application provides detailed data on applicants’ baseline characteristics.
The academic measures come primarily from high school transcripts, which report GPA and ACT
scores. We standardize GPAs to a 4.0 scale using grade conversion formulae provided by the
University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Since not all high schools report ACT scores on their transcripts,
we supplement transcript data with self-reported scores from the scholarship application for 50
percent of the experimental sample.
Most of our financial and demographic data come from applicants’ Student Aid Reports (SARs).
These reports are available for STBF applicants who filed the Free Application for Federal Student
Aid (FAFSA). SARs contain responses to more than 100 FAFSA questions regarding students’
financial resources and family structure, including family income, parental marital status, and
education. Roughly three percent of scholarship applicants are undocumented immigrants, who are
ineligible for federal financial aid and therefore cannot file the FAFSA. STBF permits these students
to submit an alternate form called the College Funding Estimator (CFE). The CFE is published by
the EducationQuest Foundation, a non-profit organization in Nebraska, and gathers similar though
less detailed information.
Neither SARs nor CFEs report students’ race, and the scholarship application did not collect
this variable until 2014. We obtained race data for all cohorts from the Nebraska Department of
Motor Vehicles (DMV). After combining the DMV and self-reported data, we observe race for 89
percent of randomized applicants before 2014 and over 99 percent from 2014 onward. We impute
race where missing using means within application strata.

Enrollment Data
More than 90 percent of experimental subjects enrolled in Nebraska public colleges, which
provide administrative records for this research. We match applicants to these data using name,
gender, date of birth, and the last four digits of Social Security Numbers. To measure enrollment
at out-of-state and private institutions, we match applicants to National Student Clearinghouse

36

(NSC) data using name and date of birth. Though the NSC captures more than 91 percent of
enrollment nationwide (and more than 99 percent at four-year public institutions), its name-based
match has limitations, as Dynarski, Hemelt and Hyman (2015) detail. Roughly two percent of
experimental applicants have enrollment spells at Nebraska public colleges that do not appear in
our NSC-matched sample.
We define post-award years to match the federal financial aid year, which runs from July 1 to
June 30, and divide each year into fall and spring halves. Within each fall and spring term, we
require binary enrollment outcomes to be mutually exclusive. Students who enroll at both two- and
four-year institutions are coded as four-year college students. Likewise, those who enroll at in-state
public colleges do not contribute to the out-of-state or private categories, and selectivity outcomes
are defined by the most-selective institution attended.

Financial Aid Data
Nebraska’s public colleges also provide detailed information on their students’ financial aid
packages, which we analyze in Table 2. These data report costs of attendance, grants, loans, and
Federal Work Study aid. While all schools report federal loans, most do not report private loans,
which may be obtained directly from lenders without involving financial aid officers. We therefore
exclude private loans from our analysis. For most students in our sample, federal loans o↵er the
lowest available interest rate and therefore account for the vast majority of borrowing.

Other Descriptive Statistics
Table 1 compares STBF applicants to the broader population of Nebraska high school seniors.
We estimate the race and sex composition of Nebraska seniors using 18-year-old Nebraskans in the
2012 sample of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results population data (SEER, 2015).
Parental education and family income figures come from 12th-grade Nebraska residents in the 2012
wave of the American Community Survey (U.S. Census Bureau 2014). There are two Nebraska
cities with more than 250,000 residents: Lincoln and Omaha. We estimate the share of high school
seniors who live in Lincoln and Omaha using enrollment figures from the Common Core of Data
and Private School Survey (US DOE, 2010a; 2010b). ACT provides data on Nebraska test takers
(ACT 2012).

Notes: These graphs document how award e↵ects vary with ACT composite score and family income. The outcome
in each panel is year-two fall enrollment. The sample includes applicant cohorts 2012-2014. Dots plot treatment
e↵ects of traditional STBF scholarship o↵ers for deciles of the given trait. Solid lines plot fitted values from regression
models that estimate the linear interaction between award status and the given trait. Dotted lines plot 95 percent
confidence intervals for the linear fitted values. ACT scores have been converted to percentiles in the distribution of
Nebraska ACT test takers.

Notes: This table reports sample counts for each enrollment time horizon. Each sample draws on data
from available applicant cohorts: 2012-2015 for year one; 2012-2014 through year two; 2013-2014
through year three; and 2012 only for year four. Column 4 describes the primary analysis sample,
which includes control applicants and STBF award winners. Column 5 includes control applicants,
STBF recipients, and COS award winners from the University of Nebraska strata. COS awards were
not offered in 2012, so year four outcomes in the COS sample are not yet available.

Notes: This table reports estimated effects of STBF award offers on bachelor's degree completion by the
end of year four. Columns 1 and 2 present estimates for the 2012 randomized sample using OLS
regression and Kline's reweighting procedure. Columns 3 and 4 report corresponding estimates for the
2011 applicant cohort, which was not subject to random assignment. Column 5 reweights the 2011 Kline
estimates in column 4 by the distribution of covariates in the 2012 randomized sample. Estimates control
for strata dummies. Demographic controls are gender, race, and parental education.
