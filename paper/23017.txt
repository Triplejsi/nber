Childhood Circumstances and Adult Outcomes: Act II

NBER Working Paper No. 23017
January 2017
JEL No. H4,I14
ABSTRACT
That prenatal events can have life-long consequences is now well established. Nevertheless,
research on the Fetal Origins Hypothesis is flourishing and has expanded to include the early
childhood (postnatal) environment. Why does this literature have a “second act?” We
summarize the major themes and contributions driving the empirical literature since our 2011
reviews, and try to interpret the literature in light of an overarching conceptual framework about
how human capital is produced early in life. One major finding is that relatively mild shocks in
early life can have substantial negative impacts, but that the effects are often heterogeneous
reflecting differences in child endowments, budget constraints, and production technologies.
Moreover, shocks, investments, and interventions can interact in complex ways that are only
beginning to be understood. Many advances in our knowledge are due to increasing accessibility
of comprehensive administrative data that allow events in early life to be linked to long-term
outcomes. Yet, we still know relatively little about the interval between, and thus about whether
it would be feasible to identify and intervene with affected individuals at some point between
early life and adulthood. We do know enough, however, to be able to identify some interventions
that hold promise for improving child outcomes in early life and throughout the life course.

The fetal origins literature has been particularly active over the last several years
rendering reviews by Currie (2009) and Almond and Currie (2011a, b) somewhat dated. Figure
1 shows the number of papers about “fetal origins” in several leading journals by year.1

Why does this literature “have legs"? By now, the rudimentary point is familiar. Currie
and Hyson (1999) using longitudinal data showed that long-term outcomes seemed to respond to
circumstances in utero; Costa (2000) found that chronic health conditions among older men were
predicted by early-life infant mortality rates in their natal areas, which can proxy for the disease
environment. Papers exploiting natural experiments to show the long-term impact of fetal and

early life shocks such as Almond (2006), Van Den Berg et al. (2006), and Bleakley (2007), are a
decade old.
One reason for continued interest is that the large magnitude of the fetal origins effects
that have been found, and the short time interval in utero suggest that in principle, Pareto
improvements can be made by re-allocating resources from later to earlier in the life cycle.
Given the common definition of economics as the study of the allocation of scarce resources
(e.g., Blackhouse and Medema, 2009), this literature resonates with a core interest of economists:
efficiency. Of course, the separation in time and across people (first the mother then the child)
makes it far from obvious how this potentially high-return reallocation of resources can best be
achieved.
A second reason for enduring interest in the Fetal Origins Hypothesis (FOH) is that it has
proven to describe a surprisingly general phenomenon. Although FOH was first formulated as a
specific theory about the effects of prenatal nutritional deprivation on chronic health conditions
in adulthood (Barker, 1998), economists have found that a wide range of early life experiences
matter and that many other (non-health) outcomes are affected. Outcomes of surpassing interest
to economists, including IQ and wages, have been linked to early life influences, as have some
newer areas of focus such as personality traits.
This evolving discovery speaks to another area of abiding interest for economics: the
debate about nature versus nurture. It has become increasingly clear that we are shaped by many
occurrences in early life which interact with our genetic endowments to either help or hinder us
in reaching our potential and/or adapting to our environment (Manski, 2011). The FOH
literature suggests that it may be possible to respond to entrenched disadvantage by altering the
3
!
!

environment in a way that promotes economic equality (Currie, 2011). Thus, the FOH remains
important because it suggests that it may be possible to counter-balance forces leading to greater
inequality (such as skill biased technical change) with investments in pregnant women, children,
and their environments broadly defined.2
In addition to surveying studies that focus on shocks that occur while the child is in utero,
this review considers shocks in early childhood. Angrist and Pischke (2010) herald a “credibility
revolution” in which clear a priori definitions of treatment and control groups combined with
time-series variation in environmental conditions help to generate sharp predictions. The FOH
hypothesis lends itself to “severe tests” (Dinardo, 2007) given that the in utero period is very
well defined, and children subjected to an external shock in utero can often be compared to
similar children born a little earlier or later, who escaeped the shock. The beginning and ending
dates of the period of “early childhood” are less well defined than the period in utero making it
somewhat more difficult to find clean “natural experiments.” It is nevertheless possible to
employ compelling identification strategies and we feel the majority of papers discussed in this
review employ compelling research designs.
In view of the large number of relevant studies, we organize the review around a series of
“handbook” style tables that we present in the supplemental file (which can be found using the
link in the abstract page). In lyric opera fashion, the tables briefly summarize each study’s
highlights. We also report the datasets used, sample sizes, the empirical strategy employed, main
results obtained, and any heterogeneity by subgroup in the tables. We have also tried to express !

!In describing “Six examples of the Long-term Benefits of Anti-Poverty Programs”, the White House’s Council of
Economic Advisers summarized recent research in this literature by economists, noting:

!

Economists have traditionally argued that anti-poverty policy faces a “great tradeoff” —
famously articulated by Arthur Okun — between equity and efficiency. Yet, recent work suggests
that Okun’s famous tradeoff may be far smaller in practice than traditionally believed and in
many cases precisely the opposite could be the case.

the main effects both as a percent with respect to the outcome mean (when the outcome mean
was provided in the paper) and in terms of a standard deviation (when the outcome’s standard
deviation was provided). To some extent, reporting estimates in % and in SD facilitates the
comparison of the effects across studies when these focus on a similar outcome (e.g., test scores).
Consistent with the broader trend in economics, many of these papers pay particular
attention to the use of large-scale administrative datasets. Beyond reducing measurement error
and recording additional outcomes, the use of administrative data can help mitigate problems of
selective attrition from surveys and the large sample sizes contribute statistical power to detect
milder treatments. These tables largely speak for themselves, so rather than walk through them,
we focus in the text on a few studies from each table in an attempt to draw some general lessons
from the existing literature and to identify promising areas for future research.
We begin by providing a conceptual framework for our review in Section 1. This
framework emphasizes the child's human capital accumulation process and parent’s optimal
investment decisions in the presence of in-utero and early childhood shocks given production
functions and budget constraints. The framework can be used to elucidate potential pathways
that underlie the empirical findings that we observe in the literature. Section 2 then provides an
overview of the literature on the importance of “mild” shocks in the early years. In addition to
new evidence about the wide range of factors that matter to child development, an important
theme that emerges is that there is often considerable heterogeneity in the effects of specific
shocks. Some of the heterogeneity in the effects of shocks may be due to parental responses that
either exacerbate or mitigate the effects. Hence, we will also consider the evidence documenting
some of these responses and their impacts in Sections 3.
5
!
!

In addition, a small but growing literature exploits situations where there are “two
shocks” in order to either separately identify the effects of initial shocks and responses to them,
or to investigate potential interactions between various types of shocks. Since this is an
interesting and novel development that resonates with the theory of capacity formation
(Heckman, 2007), some of these studies are highlighted in Section 4.
As discussed above, economists are beginning to investigate policy responses to the
FOH. Recent contributions to this literature are reviewed in Section 5. A striking feature of the
most recent literature is that the growing accessibility of administrative data has allowed
researchers to conduct policy evaluation by linking current adult outcomes with past “exposures”
to policies in a way that was not possible previously.
One practical difficulty with this approach is that it takes many years to see the effects of
fetal or early childhood shocks on adult outcomes while timelines for policy decisions are
typically much shorter. Thus, one of our conclusions is that it would be extremely useful to
know more about the “missing middle” years, and whether long term effects can be predicted
using indicators in early and middle childhood. This question is explored in Section 6. We
summarize our impressions of the literature and its future directions in Section 7.
Because the literature is growing so rapidly and in so many directions, this review will
not do justice to it all. To make the review more tractable we focus mainly on studies that
appeared after our previous reviews were published, and we do not do justice to the “disaster”
literature which relies on lethal natural catastrophes such as famines, pandemics, wars, and
hurricanes, as natural experiments. Although these papers were very important in the emergence
of the FOH, most economists now accept that disasters early in life are likely to have negative
6
!
!

long-term effects on survivors, i.e., that shocks which are “extreme enough” are likely to have
persistent effects. Moreover, the fetal origins perspective will never be pivotal in a cost-benefit
analysis of measures designed to forestall such disasters.3 Even without the benefit of the recent
economic and scientific evidence on the FOH, those suffering disaster often acted in a way to
shield pregnant women and young children (such as by giving them larger food rations in a
famine). Third, the long term effects of events that involved high mortality can be difficult to
discern given the possibility of mortality selection. If the individuals most vulnerable to
catastrophe die, then the remaining population could possibly be stronger on average. Selection
can be a particular problem when risk of death is higher for groups with lower socioeconomic
status, as it often is.
We will also neglect most of the research on conditional cash transfers, in part because it
have been reviewed elsewhere (see for example, Fiszbein and Schady, 2009). In addition to
these deliberate omissions, we will undoubtedly omit important studies by mistake, given how
active the research area has become.

We do not intend to suggest that insight and nuance cannot be gleaned from the analysis of such events. For
example, Anttila-Hughes and Hsiang (2013) study natural disasters and show that the short-run mortality effects are
followed by arguably more important future disinvestments which occur with a lag and kill girls.!

where h denotes health or human capital as assessed after childhood, A represents factor
productivity, and

and

are the investments made in the first and second periods (e.g., parental

investments). The first childhood period is denoted with subscript 1 (e.g., in utero) and the
second period of childhood (e.g., preschool years) with subscript 2.4 A bar superscript indicates
that the first period investment is already set, and what is under consideration is the second
period investment.
Following Currie and Almond (2011b), we assume that
period investments (e.g., during pregnancy) and

is an exogenous shock to second period

investments (e.g., during pre-school years). The g subscript follows from the fact that exogenous
shocks in observational studies typically appear at the group level, whereas the other components
of investments,

and

may vary at the level of the individual child. In general, we will

consider the effect of investment shocks

and

holding fixed the child-specific

investments during the first period of childhood. If we also hold fixed second period investments
(i.e.,

instead of ), then we might consider impacts from shocks on h to be “biological”

(Royer, 2009). The parameter , where

, represents the weight each childhood period

receives in the production of adult health (or more generally, adult human capital).5 The
parameter

are substitutes or complements, often a key question determining the efficacy of interventions.
We assume that parents make the investment decisions for their (only) child.
Investments are costly, and are valued insofar as they improve h. The effects of investments on

h are traded off against parental consumption, i.e., parents maximize their utility,
which is increasing in both arguments. Parents have a budget constraint (expressed in monetary
units) of:
,
where Y denotes family income, pc and pI are the market prices of consumption and investment,
and r is the interest rate. We assume a Cobb-Douglas utility function of the form:
(2)
and consider how the production technology can shape the observed investment response. In
particular, we consider two “extreme” production technologies which have polar opposite
predictions for the investment response. The first special case is one of perfect substitutability of
investments. If

If the

shock is positive (e.g., prenatal Food Stamps), then optimized postnatal investments

fall in response. If

is negative (e.g., prenatal stress), then postnatal investments increase in

response. That is, period 2 investments are compensatory. When investment responses are
compensatory, reduced form analyses of the impact of

effects (Royer, 2009).
Following Heckman (2007), we now consider the opposite extreme of perfectly
complementary investments:

!

The period 2 investment response is now reinforcing. Attempting to ameliorate a negative
prenatal shock is completely ineffective, so it is optimal to match period 1 investments (subject
to weighting by ) but consume the rest.
The takeaway from these two examples is that whether parents reinforce or compensate
shocks can depend on the production technology. Above, we have assumed an “intermediate"
substitutability in parental preferences between consumption and their child’s h: Cobb-Douglas.

For whom period 1 investments are “low”, i.e.,

10
!

By a similar argument, the substitutability of consumption and child outcomes h will also govern
the response to early childhood shocks. That said, we might suspect that parameters of parental
preferences are particularly difficult to modify.
We might think that in addition to low income, y, poor families face restricted access to
production technologies. Given a productivity factor

for disadvantaged families, we

would see worse child outcomes for equivalent income and investments. It is also possible that
poor families have different values of

and , which would generate more nuanced predictions

for investments and child outcomes.
There have been few attempts to estimate this underlying production function (1), in
order to directly measure the key parameters

and , presumably because of the detailed data

necessary and the strong assumptions which must be made in order to render the production
function simple enough to be estimable (Cunha and Heckman, 2008; Cunha, Heckman, and
Schennach, 2010). However, arguably this underlying framework serves to motivate, guide, and
interpret the more reduced form and observational work that is discussed below.
The framework also lays bare the multiple mechanisms that can underlie a given
empirical result. For instance, if we observe that parents do or do not make compensating later
life investments in a child who suffered from an early life shock, is this because of parental
preferences, budget constraints,7 or the production function they are facing? Answering this
question is important because without a knowledge of the mechanisms and responses, a policy
designed to address this issue will be a shot in the dark.

Similarly, given the different pathways through which a child’s outcomes can be affected,
it is not surprising to see pronounced heterogeneity in the effect of many shocks by parental
education, income, and other indicators of socioeconomic status (such as race or gender in some
contexts). Subgroups may be more or less exposed to correlated shocks that interact with the
“primary” shock considered, either to magnify or to dampen its effect. And even within finelysliced subpopulations, the same group-level shock can yield varying individual exposures. For
example, a house that is airtight may let in less air pollution than a neighboring house that is
drafty. Third, families have differential access to knowledge and resources that can be used to
offset the effects of negative shocks. For instance, while some individuals may have access to
credit markets or savings, others may be credit constrained. They may also have different
preferences for such intervention. For example, in communities where gender discrimination is
the norm, parents may not endorse interventions targeted to girls. Finally, children of low
socioeconomic status may simply be located at a steeper portion of the production function,
yielding a larger effect of a shock of any given size (Almond and Currie, 2011b).
Even our focus on the missing research on the “middle years” can be seen as a response
to the difficulties involved in understanding the underlying production function for human
capital. If it could be shown that outcome measures in middle childhood satisfied the “exclusion
restriction” (that early childhood impacts adult outcomes only through observed outcomes in the
middle years), this would greatly simplify the data requirements necessary to estimate a
structural production function.
We should acknowledge that our stylized framework does not lend itself to considering
dynamic complementarities -- the idea that “skill begets skill,” or alternatively that stocks of
12
!
!

capacities acquired by period t-1 may make investment in period t more productive (Heckman,
2007). Nor does it do justice to “self-productivity” (Heckman, 2007) – which includes the idea
that a given dimension of capacity may also affect the accumulation of another, distinct
dimension.8 For example, cognitive capacity might promote health (or vice versa). Were we to
“force” dynamic complementarities into (1) and consider

, for instance, one would

find that the interaction of such shocks is always positive (which departs from what some of the
recent empirical literature finds as discussed below). Additionally, dynamic complementarities
are defined by Heckman (2007) in terms of the return to investments and how they vary with the
baseline stock, which is absent from our stylized model. Thus, we will not attempt to model
dynamic complementarities here but merely reiterate Heckman’s (2007) definition, namely:

where ƒ is monotone increasing in its arguments, twice continuously differentiable, and concave
in I, p represents parental capabilities, and

represents (a vector of) child capabilities. Heckman

assumes that dynamic complementarities are positive. With instruments for both the baseline
stock of human capital and for endogenous subsequent investments, we could shed light on the
magnitude of dynamic complementarities without making assumptions about their sign or
functional form.
In practice, it is often not empirically possible to distinguish between dynamic
complementarities, self-productivity, and the possibility that parents (or society) invest more (or
less) in children with higher baseline stocks of human capital in unobserved ways (e.g.,
Malamund, Pop-Eleches, and Urquiola, 2016). Nevertheless, distinguishing among these

Along with “mechanical” effects on the same dimension.

13
!
!

alternatives remains conceptually important because the source of heterogeneity in the dynamic
effects of shocks has implications for the effectiveness of remediation, and specifically, whether
investments later in childhood can reduce or eliminate damage originating from the prenatal or
early childhood period. For instance, if a child has cognitive difficulties as a result of being
premature, a parent may respond by spending more time with the child, reading to them and
assisting with homework. We may wish to examine the effects of these interventions, but the
interventions themselves are endogenous to the child’s state. Moreover, while we would like to
be able to consider each potential investment as a stand-alone intervention, in reality many
aspects of the environment are in flux at any point in time, and different types of investments
may complement or substitute for each other. A few studies that attempt to address dynamic
complementarities are discussed in Section 4 below, and illustrate the challenges researchers
face. We begin below with the simpler case of single shocks experienced in early childhood.
Section 2: Make Mine Mild
Events and circumstances that are commonly experienced can have lasting effects on
children’s trajectories. For example, there is growing consensus that relatively mild nutritional
deprivation at critical periods can seriously impair fetal and child development. In terms of our
conceptual framework, both

and

may be sizable, even when the shock

considered is small in magnitude relative to total investments or short in duration. Critically,
“mild” prenatal shocks are much more common than extreme ones like famine. Table 1
summarizes much of the recent literature about mild shocks, which are divided into several
categories including: nutrition, stress, disease, pollution, weather shocks, and alcohol and
tobacco. The last column reports on heterogeneity in the estimated effects on different groups, a
14

format that is followed in all the Tables that follow. With some exceptions, these papers aim to
capture the biological effect of early-childhood shocks, implicitly assuming that second period
investments are unresponsive to the shocks and fixed (
a)! Nutritional Shocks
Panel A of Table 1 summarizes some of the recent literature on nutrition-related shocks.
Fasting is of broad interest as roughly three-quarters of the world’s 1.6 billion Muslims spent
some portion of the in utero period during Ramadan.9 Almond and Mazumder (2011), Almond,
Mazumder, and Van Ewijk (2015), Hoffman (2014), and Greve, Schultz-Nielsen, and Tekin
(2015) all study the effects of Ramadan fasting during pregnancy. Ramadan cycles through the
calendar, enabling the effects of Ramadan fasting to be separated from seasonal variation in
nutrition. Moreover, most people break their fast at sun down so that the fasting is only for a
limited period of time during the day. Nevertheless, this mild and brief nutritional deprivation
appears to have effects on sex ratios (reducing the number of boys who appear to be more likely
to be miscarried). For example, there are large effects on sex ratios among children of Arabian
descent in Michigan. Perhaps surprisingly in view of relatively modest effects on birth weight,
prenatal Ramadan exposure is estimated to have pronounced effects on adult outcomes in a wide
variety of settings (e.g., Uganda, Iraq, Indonesia, England, and Denmark), including to
educational attainment, test scores, adult anthropometrics, mental disability, and wealth
measures.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

!Almond, Mazumder, and Van Ewijk (2015) speculate that meal skipping, dieting, and morning sickness may all
exert similar effects in non-Muslim populations. For example, Almond, Edlund, Joffe, and Palme (2016) find that
severe morning sickness also reduces the likelihood of male birth in Sweden.

15
!
!

Likewise, positive nutrition-related shocks can also have substantial effects even when
relatively mild. For example, Linnemayr and Alderman (2011) examine nutritional
supplementation for pregnant women and 0 to 3 year old children in Senegal and find that
supplementation during pregnancy has a significant effect on the weight-for-age of toddlers, but
that post-birth supplementation had little impact, suggesting the uniqueness of the in utero period
(a common refrain in the literature). Two papers by Feyrer, Politi, and Weil (2013) and
Adhvaryu et al. (2016) build on Field, Robles, and Torero’s (2009) ground breaking study of the
effects of iodine deficiency in Kenya. The more recent studies use historical data about the
rollout of iodine fortification in the U.S. Because the rollout took place at different times in
different places, it is possible to identify the effect of early exposure and to show that it improved
both female labor force participation and the probability that male World War I recruits were
assigned to the Air Force (a marker for ability). They thus provide additional evidence that
relatively mild nutritional deficiency can have large negative long term effects even in otherwise
high-resource settings.
Adhvaryu et al. (2016) also analyzes measures of parental investments in children, albeit
coarse ones, and find evidence that postnatal investments responded to the shock. In particular,
they argue that postnatal vaccinations and breastfeeding behaviors reinforced the prenatal shock,
i.e.,

, so their reduced form estimates overstate the biological effect. As discussed

above (and further in Almond and Currie, 2011b), to the extent that period 1 and period 2 are
complements, there are stronger tendencies for parents to reinforce endowment shocks.
Ludwig, Rouse, and Currie (2013) show that maternal weight gain during pregnancy
predicts childhood obesity in the context of sibling fixed effects models. This study is based on
16
!
!

birth certificates for several entire cohorts of children born in Arkansas, which were linked to
“body mass index (BMI) report cards” issued by the schools. It is one of an increasing number
of studies that show how new access to large-scale administrative data sets can shed light on
FOH questions.
Fitzsimons and Vera-Hernandez (2014) use a novel instrumental variables strategy for
postnatal nutrition, focusing on non-C-section births to U.K. women. They note that mothers of
infants born on weekends are less likely to receive breastfeeding instruction, and are
correspondingly less likely to go on to breastfeed. Using this variation, they find large effects of
breastfeeding on cognitive development. However, the IV approach involves strong exclusion
restrictions, in this case that there is nothing else about being born on a weekend (or about
having a scheduled C-section) that might lead to poorer outcomes (such as different preferences,
inferior nursing care, or less access to specialists).
As a group, these studies support the hypothesis that relatively ordinary variations in
nutrition (positive and negative) that are within the experience of many contemporary families
even in rich countries like the U.S. and the U.K., have the potential to impact children health
both at birth and in the longer term.
b)! Prenatal Maternal Stress
Panel B of Table 1 focuses on the impact of maternal stress during pregnancy on fetal
outcomes. While the idea that excessive stress has negative health effects is widespread, it is
difficult to assess. Cortisol, the most common biometric measure of stress, is not available in
most health datasets and also varies widely over the course of a day, which even longitudinal
cortisol data do not solve per se. In the absence of a direct measure of stress, the most common
17

approach in the literature is therefore reduced form: Evaluating whether an exogenous event that
is likely to have caused maternal stress can be shown to have affected children.
Currie and Rossin-Slater (2013) identify women in Texas who lived in the announced
potential path of major hurricanes during pregnancy. It is important to note that most of these
women were not in the end affected by the hurricane, so this is not a disaster study in the usual
sense in that it is possible to separate the effect of stress from the direct economic or health
effects of the event. They highlight an issue that often arises in the fetal effects literature, which
is that infants with longer gestations are more likely to have been exposed to any periodic shock
because they have a longer exposure window. Since infants with longer gestations are healthier,
other things being equal, this mechanical relationship tends to bias the estimated effect of shocks
towards zero. They use a sibling fixed effects framework to compare affected to unaffected
children and they address maternal mobility, an issue that frequently arises in a sibling fixed
effects framework. The problem is that mothers may well respond to a shock by moving. In that
case, changes in locational characteristics or exposure between the siblings are endogenous to the
shock. This issue is addressed by instrumenting actual exposure with measures of “potential
exposure” created by assuming that mothers stay in the same place that they were first observed,
and that all gestations last exactly nine months. This counterfactual exposure is in fact highly
correlated with actual exposure because most mothers do stay in the same place, and most
gestations do last nine months. They conclude that stress increases the probability of an
abnormal condition of the newborn, but they found no effects on the incidence of low birth
weight or gestation length, two of the more common measures of fetal health.

Persson and Rossin-Slater (2016), and Quintana-Domeque and Rodenas-Serrano (2016)
study the effect of more severe emotional shocks including, the death of a family member in
Sweden, and terrorist attacks in Spain, respectively. The former uses Swedish registry data to
follow affected children up to age 30. An important innovation of their study relative to some
earlier work on the same question is that they compare mothers who lost a family member while
pregnant, to mothers who lost a family member in the year after birth. Since families of lower
socioeconomic status are more likely to lose family members, and since losing a family member
could well have an economic impact, this design is cleaner than comparing mothers with a death
in the family to mothers without such an event. While the effects on birth weight are small
overall, they appear to be concentrated in the lower tail of the distribution, with a 20% increase
in the incidence of low birth weight (birth weight less than 2500 grams). In a second
contribution, they are able to follow affected infants into adulthood, and they find negative
effects on mental health outcomes measured using prescription drug data. For instance, affected
individuals are 23% more likely to use ADHD medication, and 9% more likely to use
antidepressants as adults. Quintana-Domeque and Rodenas-Serrano also find small but
significant effects of terrorist attacks in Spain on overall birth outcomes.
Lee (2014) asks whether the grandchildren of women who suffered a severe stress are
less healthy? This is a particularly exciting direction for future work, given that thus far, there is
not a great deal of research on intergenerational effects of in utero shocks in humans, although
they are known to exist in animal models. In this case the initial shock is was a massacre of
civilian demonstrators by the civilian military. He finds small but significant effects on the
incidence of low birth weight and prematurity in the grandchildren, with the largest impacts for
grandmothers who suffered the shock during the second trimester that the mothers were in utero.

Aizer, Stroud, and Buka (2016) have made an exceptional contribution to this literature
because the data they use (which was collected by a consortium of perinatal centers in the 1960s)
actually includes measured stress during pregnancy using cortisol. The data set includes a large
number of sibling pairs, so that it is possible to conduct mother fixed effects analyses. They find
that infants exposed to higher cortisol levels during pregnancy have up to 1 year less school at
age 7 than their siblings, indicating that they have been delayed in starting school or held back.
Given rich background information on the mothers, this study is also able to ask which infants
are most affected by higher maternal stress levels? They find that children born to less educated
mothers suffer larger impacts of exposure to a given cortisol level, suggesting that perhaps there
were fewer resources available to buffer the impact ex-post.
We have included Aizer’s (2011) study of the impact of assault (overwhelmingly due to
domestic violence) in this Section of the table even though domestic violence can have direct
effects on fetal health in addition to causing maternal stress. Our justification for doing so is that
domestic violence is quantitatively important and vastly understudied as a source either of stress
or physical injury. The study is based on California hospital discharge data linked to birth
records. Variation in the probability of assault is induced by the strengthening of laws against
domestic violence, which occurred at different times in different California counties. She finds
that domestic violence has a large negative effect on birth weight. Since women of lower
socioeconomic status are more likely to be assaulted, violence is therefore an additional cause of
disparities in birth outcomes.
c)! Infectious Disease

20

Panel C of Table 1 deals with recent evidence about the effects of disease. Some diseases
that have only mild effects in adults are known to have devastating effects on a developing fetus
(e.g., Rubella, Zika), while others, like pandemic influenza killed millions and have also been
shown to have effects on fetuses in utero. Recent studies focus on the related questions of
whether milder diseases can have serious effects; whether the effects of early life exposure to
disease are long-lasting; and whether there are spillover effects of disease eradication to children
who were not directly targeted. The studies we summarize cover a wide range of settings, from
impoverished areas of developing countries, to the historical U.S., to modern Denmark.
The studies by Baird, Hicks, Kremer, and Miguel (2016) and Oizer (2014) build on the
famous “worms” paper of Kremer and Miguel (2004) in which the authors investigated the effect
of giving children de-worming medication on school attendance and on whether neighboring
children were infected with parasites. The new studies ask (respectively) how the effect of
deworming affects outcomes of affected children 10 years later, and whether other children
benefited from the deworming of their neighbors. Significant and positive effects of deworming
are found on virtually all outcomes examined. Unfortunately Oizer does not examine exactly the
same outcomes as Baird et al., so it is hard to compare the effects on index children to those on
their neighbors, but in keeping with the original paper, deworming initiatives definitely appear to
be very cost-effective.
Bhalotra and Venkataramani (2013) and Beach et al. (2016) focus on water borne
diseases in Mexico in the 1990s, and in early 20th century America, respectively. The former
examine the effect of a clean water reform in Mexico in 1991, which reduced the incidence of
water borne diseases, including diarrhea, one of the most common causes of mortality and
21
!
!

morbidity among infants. Beach et al. (2016) use typhoid mortality rates as a proxy for water
quality. Bhalotra and Venkataramani find significantly positive but quite small effects of the
reduction in water-borne diseases on test scores at ages 9-15. These estimates may understate
the effect of clean water given improved survival of the weakest infants, who may end up with
low test scores for reasons unrelated to water-borne disease. The Beach et al. estimates appear to
be larger: They estimate that moving from the top of the typhoid distribution to eradication
would increase educational attainment in surviving children by 1/3 of a year and increase
earnings by 4%. This larger effect is unsurprising given that typhoid is at the extreme end of
potential severity of water-borne contaminants and many of the contaminants addressed by the
water campaigns studied by Bhalotra and Venkataramani would have caused less severe disease.
Thus, a possible interpretation is that more severe shocks have a greater impact than less severe
shocks but with only two data points it is impossible to say much more about the shape of this
relationship.
Venkataramani (2012) builds on work by Bleakley (2010) and others on the long-term
effects of malaria. He finds large effects of malaria eradication in the birth year, consistent with
those previous studies. Currie and Schwandt (2013) focus on a much milder and currently more
common disease: Seasonal influenza. While Almond (2006) showed that the Spanish flu
epidemic of 1918 had long lasting effects, it was a killer disease. Currie and Schwandt show that
even a relatively mild disease such as seasonal influenza can have negative long term effects if a
fetus is exposed at the wrong time during pregnancy. They show that in the contemporary
northeastern U.S., infants conceived in May have a much higher probability of preterm delivery
(and hence of low birth weight) than infants conceived at other times because they come to term

22
!
!

at the height of the flu season. Moreover, the H1N1 flu season of 2009 was earlier and more
virulent than usual and the spike in prematurity was correspondingly earlier and larger that year.
Schwandt (2016) and Ward and Phipps (2014) follow up on these observations by
examining the long-term effects of exposure to flu in utero in Denmark and Canada, respectively.
Schwandt examines rich individual longitudinal Danish registry data about women who were
hospitalized with influenza and follows their children into adulthood. He finds that earnings are
10% lower for affected individuals, and that they are much more likely than others to be
dependent on welfare. These long-term outcomes are driven by maternal admissions during the
2nd and 3rd trimester. Ward and Phipps (2014) exploit province-level data on influenza rates to
identify the effects of exposure. They do not find any overall effect of an additional week of flu
exposure during the pregnancy, but do find a small effect of additional weeks of exposure during
the 1st trimester on test scores and on the probability of having a chronic condition. Given that
the richness of the Schwandt data it seems that for now, the presumption should be that his
conclusions about the timing of the impacts are more likely to be correct. However, the larger
message is that millions of children may be harmed in utero by exposure to relatively mild
diseases even in rich countries.
Bhalotra and Venkataramani (2015) examine the long-term impact of the introduction of
sulfa drugs in 1937, which reduced pneumonia mortality but presumably also had positive effects
reducing morbidity.10 Combining historical data with the U.S. population Census, cohorts who
were exposed to sulfa drugs in their infancy attained 0.1 more years of schooling, were 1.5%
more likely to graduate from high school, more likely to be employed (0.4%), and earned higher

An earlier paper Jayachandran, Lleras-Muney, and Smith (2010) established that the introduction of these drugs
did indeed lead to large declines in mortality from causes such as infections after child birth and pneumonia.
Bhalotra and Venkataramani focus on the effects of the introduction on cohorts of children at older ages.

wages (1.5%). Long-term benefits varied for African-American men who were exposed to
different levels of segregation in their state of birth, suggesting that despite a strong economic
climate (better early life conditions), institutional environment affects the rewards to investments
in human capital.
d)! Pollution Exposure
The last few years have seen an explosion of research on the effects of pollution in early
life, much of which is summarized in Panel D of Table 1. Certain pollutants are well measured
in developed countries, exhibit variation over time and across small areas, and have published
thresholds which lend themselves to asking whether pollution below the threshold can also be
shown to have an adverse effect. Moreover, many sources and types of pollution have been
increasingly well documented in recent years, and have discrete beginning and ending dates
(such as pollution due to industrial plant openings or closings) that assist identification.
Relative to the literature discussed in our earlier reviews, much of the newest literature
focuses on documenting the long-term effects of fetal or early childhood exposures, often relying
on newly available large-scale administrative data sources to track children over time. For
example, Isen, Rossin-Slater, and Walker (2015) look at the effects of reductions in air pollution
due to the Clean Air Acts of 1970 on the employment and earnings of adults who were affected
in very early childhood. The Clean Air Acts (CAA) mandated that pollution reduction measures
be implemented in counties that were above thresholds for target pollutants. Counties just below
these thresholds were not required to clean up. The legislation thus lends itself to analysis using
a regression discontinuity framework. In order however to examine outcomes, it is necessary to

24
!
!

merge data from several large administrative data sets, some of which are held in Census data
centers.
Specifically, they start with the Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Employer Household
Dynamics (LEHD) file, which records a worker’s unemployment insurance covered earnings
each quarter. The authors focus on 24 states that appear continuously in the LEHD and on
individuals who were born in these states. The payoff to all this careful data work is that the
authors are able for the first time to link air pollution changes around the time of birth to adult
earnings and employment. They find an estimated gain of $4,300 in earnings per person for a
total of $6.5 billion (2008 dollars) in gains.
Another focus of the literature on pollution and early childhood is to ask whether there is
heterogeneity in the effects of pollution. There are many reasons to expect disparate impacts of
the same potential exposures. For example, more educated people may be more knowledgeable
about ways to protect themselves (i.e., have access to a different production function), or may be
more likely to take measures that compensate for the harmful effects of pollution (perhaps
because of looser budget constraints). They may even be more likely to move away from known
pollution sources while the child is still young (Currie, 2011). Richer people may live in housing
that insulates them from the effects of pollution, for example, by having houses that are more
airtight, or houses that are physically located slightly further from sources such as freeways or
factories.
The literature does generally find more negative effects of pollution on more
disadvantaged people, whether disadvantage is defined in terms of minority race, income, or
education. The only study in Table 1 that finds the opposite is Black et al. (2014) who study the
effect of radioactive fallout from nuclear tests on Norwegians born in the 1950s and early 1960s.
25
!
!

In this one case, they find that the effects of potential exposure are greater for the more educated,
perhaps because people were unaware of the danger and more educated people were more likely
to spend time out of doors (echoing earlier findings by Lleras-Muney for ozone, 2010).
Billings and Schnepel (2015) offer some evidence that the negative effects of early-life
pollution exposure might actually be reversed with appropriate interventions, which can be
interpreted as evidence about the substitutability of investments in different life periods. The
authors show that children who were lead poisoned in Charlotte, North Carolina, and who also
received an intense intervention comprised of education for caregivers, lead remediation
services, nutritional and medical assessments, and other nutritional benefits from the Special
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), experienced
reductions in antisocial behavior and substantial improvements in school performance relative to
peers who did not receive these services because they had slightly lower blood lead levels. Since
we know that the physical effects of lead are irreversible (once deposited in the brain for
example, lead tends to stay there), this result offers hope that compensation for early life insults
is possible even when the physiological effects of such insults cannot be reversed.
e)! Weather and Climate Change
With increasing scientific consensus about the reality of human induced global warming,
economists have responded to concerns about the short and long term effects of climate change
on young children. These studies generally extrapolate from what is known about the effects of
short-term variations in weather, including periods of high temperature, variations in the amount
of sunlight, drought, or flooding. These studies are summarized in Panel E of Table 1. Of these
papers, only the one by Wernerfelt, Slusky, and Zeckhauser (2016) is arguably really about
26
!
!

weather effects per se. The authors find that exposure to sunlight in utero is associated with
lower incidence of asthma in affected U.S. cohorts, a result that they attribute to the effect of
vitamin D on lung development in utero.
The remaining papers find effects that may work through economic mechanisms as well
as through biological pathways. In terms of the Section 1 framework, these papers are implicitly
considering the optimized response of h to

(changes in parental income). Given the budget

constraint in Section 1, a negative income shock would reduce investments in children in both
period 1 and period 2 so as to equate marginal utilities of parental consumption and investing in
children (at a higher level). If the marginal utility of consumption increases substantially with
reduced consumption, child investments will need to be reduced even more. This may be
particularly true at low baseline levels of consumption.
Several studies focus on weather shocks in rural populations where conditions outside the
norm may lead to income losses by affecting crop yields; this may be a major pathway through
which weather affects child outcomes. For example, Agüero (2014) examine the effect of high
temperatures in a nationally representative sample of Mexicans, and find that higher
temperatures during early childhood are associated with lower adult height. The effects are
greater in poorer districts which could be either because people in those areas are less able to
shield themselves through, for example, air conditioning (i.e., a biological effect working
through the production function), or because many poorer parts of Mexico are agricultural and
heat may cause crop losses (an economic effect working through the budget constraint). One
limitation of the work to date is that it is often impossible to distinguish between these pathways.

27
!
!

The remaining papers in Panel E deal with fluctuations in rainfall, which are probably
even more likely to lead to crop loss, and thus to affect outcomes primarily through economic
channels. The Shah and Steinberg (2016) study is interesting in that it finds that drought has a
positive effect on children’s educational attainment in India. They explain this finding by
arguing that in India, developments that prevent children from working in the fields may benefit
their education. In the context of the model sketched above, one would have to add children’s
potential earnings to the budget constraint and allow weather to affect the market wage for
children’s labor (and thereby the opportunity cost of schooling investments) in order to capture
this effect.
f)! Effects of Alcohol and Tobacco on Fetal Development
Finally, Panel F of Table 1 considers three recent papers discussing the effects of alcohol
and tobacco control policies on fetal development. While it is well known that alcohol and
tobacco can harm the developing fetus, these studies focus on heterogeneity in the effects of
policy, and on longer-term effects. Von Hinke, Kessler, and Scholder et al. (2014) find longterm effects of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy on children’s test scores up to
age 16 in data from the Avon Longitudinal Study. This study uses genetic variation in the
mother as an instrument for alcohol consumption. Causal interpretation of an alcohol effect
requires the assumption that the genetic variation in question has no effect other than through
maternal alcohol consumption, which is questionable since currently scientists have relatively
little understanding of the multiple pathways through which an observed genetic variation may
impact a person. That is, even if we knew with certainty that a particular gene was associated
with alcoholism, it might also be independently associated with cognitive problems in the
28
!
!

offspring. An additional concern about the use of genetic data as instrumental variables is that
genetic effect sizes are often very small and therefore raise possible concerns about weak
instruments.
Using register data from Sweden, Nilsson (2015) investigates the long-term effects of a
policy that permitted strong beer sales in grocery stores, which resulted in a temporary and sharp
increase in access to alcohol among young people. He finds that cohorts affected in utero early
in pregnancy had 24% lower earnings at age 30, as well as lower cognitive, non-cognitive, and
educational outcomes. Effects were particularly concentrated on males and among children from
low-income families. Boys were also more likely to be premature or spontaneously aborted than
girls. In terms of equation (1), Nilsson (2015) floats the possibility that boys and girls have
different values for .
Bharadwaj, Johnsen, and Loken (2014) study the effect of smoking bans in Norway. The
authors are able to identify mothers who worked in bars and restaurants while pregnant. They
find significant effects on health at birth and also on adult income at age 28, but the effect of the
reform is much stronger for mothers who were smoking at the start of the pregnancy, suggesting
non-linear effects of tobacco exposure.
Simon (2016) examines the effects of changes in state-level tobacco taxes in the U.S. on
maternal smoking and child health and finds that higher taxes were associated with fewer days
absent from school, and reductions in the utilization of medical care, as well as with 16% fewer
asthma attacks. These effects are much greater for the least educated mothers. Barreca and Page
(2015) use a similar design to consider state-level changes in minimum legal drinking age laws

29
!
!

and find improvements in birth outcomes among affected cohorts of women. Their estimates are
also suggest improvements in the survival of black infants to term.
An economic model of a parent’s choice to use alcohol or tobacco while pregnant is
complicated by the fact that while in the short-term the parent trades off utility from their own
consumption against the investment in a child’s health, their actions also directly affect the return
to future investment in child health. That is, future investments are likely to be less productive if
the child is damaged by fetal alcohol syndrome, for example.
Section 3: Parental Investments
The evidence in Section 2 shows that relatively mild shocks can, if delivered at the right
or wrong time, have lasting positive or negative impacts on the developing fetus and young
child. The question arises then as to whether there are parental investments that can mitigate the
effects of negative shocks. Conceptually, this question centers on the parameters of the CES
production function

and .11 Knowing that period 1 investments have a large effect on h per

se tells us relatively little about the effectiveness of period 2 investments, including whether
damage from a period 1 shock can be remediated by additional period 2 investments (whereas
knowing

and

would take us closer).

A related question is how parents respond to positive or negative shocks to one of their
children: Does

change in response to

? Framed this way, the question does not require

assumptions about the production technology for h or parental preferences. That said, various
underlying concepts from the model will govern any observed investment response. These
include parents’ preferences (for instance, does the parent wish to equalize outcomes or to

maximize the total productivity of their offspring), and the constraints that they face.12 For
instance if a parent cannot afford the cost of intervening to help a disabled child, but can afford
basic investment in a non-disabled sibling, then their choice may well be obvious. If many
parents are constrained in their investments, then social investments may have an important
impact on parent’s choices by changing the productivity and cost of their own investments.
Thus, distinguishing between behavior due to preferences and behavior due to constraints can be
a key input to intelligent policy responses. Moreover, as Heckman (2008) points out, it may be
the case that timing matters. The productivity of current investments may depend in important
ways on whether past investments have taken place.
Table 2 summarizes some of the recent literature on parental investments. Hsin (2012)
was one of the first papers to consider that parental investments in their young children may
reflect not only preferences, but also constraints. Using sibling fixed effects models and
employing data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), she showed that college
educated mothers compensate low birth weight children (i.e., invest in order to try to equalize
outcomes) while less educated mothers tended to concentrate resources (such as reading, playing,
and doing hobbies) on higher birth weight children. A limitation of her study is that the number
of low birth weight children with low birth weight siblings is quite small in the PSID so the
results are suggestive rather than definitive about the behavior of U.S. parents.
Breining et al. (2015) find evidence consistent with parents trying to equalize outcomes
between siblings. They use Danish registry data and examine children whose siblings were either

The returns to investment are governed by the elasticity of substitution of investment made at different stages of
childhood. These returns have an impact on whether parents compensate versus reinforce, whatever their
preferences are. For example, if a parent wants to compensate, but there are no suitable investments available or
their return is low, then he or she will might well choose to invest in another child which would have the effect of
reinforcing differences.

just above the 1500 gram threshold used to classify children as very low birth weight or just
below it. Children just below the threshold were found to receive more care and be healthier
subsequently (as in Almond, Doyle, Kowalski, and Williams, 2010). The novel finding is that
their siblings also do better in school, which suggests that medical intervention for the very low
birth weight child benefitted all the children in the family. One interpretation of this result is that
parents would otherwise have sacrificed the well-being of the healthy children in order to focus
on the more vulnerable child. Alternatively, however, shocks to one child may work through
the budget constraint to affect other children even in a rich country like Denmark where most
medical care would be paid for by the state.
Akee et al. (2015) investigate the effects of a casino opening on the Eastern Cherokee
reservation which resulted in an exogenous income transfer to tribal households. They find that
parents reacted to the transfer by investing more in children who had lower levels of mental
health and “worse” personality traits. This result seems to reflect preferences for equal
outcomes—although the mechanism is a change in the budget constraint, the parent has a choice
about which child to spend the “extra” money on. On the other hand, several studies in
developing countries (Yi et al., 2014; Adhvaryu and Nyshadham, 2016) find evidence consistent
with parents reinforcing initial differences between children which could reflect either
preferences, , or budgetary realities.
Two studies of gender differences in investments also find opposite results for developing
and developed countries. Bharadwaj and Lakdawala (2013) focus on India, China, and
Bangladesh and find that mothers pregnant with a boy get more prenatal care and that boys are
more likely to receive tetanus shots after birth. One only sees the difference in prenatal care
32
!
!

among mothers who had an ultrasound and so presumably know that they are carrying boys.
However, in Canada, the U.S., and the U.K., Baker and Milligan (2016) find that parents of
children aged 0 to 3 put more time into girls and that this time investment can explain as much as
a third of the gender gap in reading scores in the early grades. It is possible that this pattern
reflects mother’s preferences for girls if mothers are the primary caregivers.
From this brief description of a number of studies, it should be apparent that there is no
simple answer to the question of whether or why parents compensate or reinforce differences
between their children.13 It does seem that parents are more likely to reinforce differences in
low resource settings, suggesting that the observed behaviors are at least partially a response to
binding budget constraints in many instances.
The discussion above assumes that parents are making informed choices about
investments in their children. Dizon-Ross (2015) investigates how parental investments
responded to better information about children’s academic performance using a field experiment
in Malawi that targeted parents with young children. Results show that providing parents with
information about how each child is doing causes them to reallocate their educational
investments across children so that investments correspond more closely to their children’s true
achievement level.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
13

Fryer, Levitt, and List (2015) focus on a different but related question, which is whether we can incentivize parents
to invest more in their young children? They organized a randomized trial in Chicago in which parents were
rewarded for activities such as attending educational sessions about early childhood, completing homework
assignments with their children, and for their child’s demonstration of mastery on interim assessments. These tasks
were chosen to improve cognition and executive function. They found that the intervention benefited white and
Hispanic children, but not African-American children. Moreover, effects were bigger for children with better
cognitive skills to begin with. This study may illustrate some of the limits of trying to improve children’s outcomes
by working to improve parenting skills.!

33
!
!

Similarly, Cunha, Elo, and Culhane (2015) argue that U.S. mothers have poor
information on the return to early childhood investments. They speculate that if the government
could implement a policy that moved expectations from the median current belief to the true
median return, that parental investments would go up by 4% to 24% and the stocks of cognitive
skills at age 24 months would increase by 1% to 5%. If parents lack information about the likely
impact of investments in their children, then once again their behavior cannot be said to reflect
their underlying preferences; perhaps information could be modeled as an input into child health
production such that parents with incorrect information end up optimizing with respect to the
wrong production function.
Perhaps an overall take away is that economists have been too quick to interpret parent’s
choices as revealed preference when even a simple economic model suggests that factors such as
available production technologies and budgets, not to mention information, are likely to be
tremendously important.
Section 4: Sometimes Lightning Strikes Twice
In this Section (and in Table 3) we consider a handful of studies that attempt to examine
dynamic complementarities empirically using cases where there were two shocks. These studies
are often reminiscent of the first generation of fetal origin studies in their reliance on quirky and
exotic instruments (which is why we characterize them as akin to being struck twice by
lightening), and in the fact that it may be difficult to generalize some of their conclusions to other
settings. Nevertheless, they represent the frontier in terms of trying to apply insights from the
theory outlined in Section 1 to applied work in this area.

Aguilar and Vicarelli (2015) overlay variation from Mexico's conditional cash-transfer
Progresa program on top of rainfall shocks induced by El Niño. They consider shocks that
affected children both prenatally and up to age 2 and examine anthropometric and cognitive
outcomes at ages 2 to 6. They did not find that Progresa mitigated any of the negative effects of
weather shocks. In contrast, Adhvaryu et al. (2015) use a very similar design and ask whether
Progresa mitigated the effects of rainfall shocks on cognitive test scores and years of education
measured at ages 12 to 21. They estimate that Progresa offset 60 to 80% of the negative effects
of rainfall shocks on child development. It is unclear whether these conflicting results are caused
by subtle differences in the approaches taken, or whether it is really the case that one can see
positive long-term effects even in cases where the immediate short-term effects appear to be
negligible. Certainly much of the literature on early intervention programs has this flavor,
finding initial effects that “fade out” by age 8 or 9 but then reappear in adulthood (Almond and
Currie, 2011b).
Gunnsteinsson et al. (2016) examine data from a randomized controlled trial of Vitamin
A supplementation in Bangladesh that took place between 2001 and 2007. In 2005, parts of the
study area were devastated by a tornado. The authors find that tornado exposure in early
pregnancy and early infancy had significant negative effects on birth weight and infant
anthropometrics. However, they also find that infants treated with vitamin A at birth were
effectively protected from the effects of experiencing a tornado shock at 0 to 3 months of age in
that there did not appear to be any effect of the tornado on anthropometrics at 6 months. An
unusual feature of this paper is the author’s care in trying to entangle the optimal timing of the
protective investment relative to the timing of the shock.

35
!
!

One difference between Gunnesteinson et al. and Advharyu et al., is the amount of time
that occurs between the negative shock and the human capital investment. While in the case of
the tornado in Bangladesh the interval between the shock and the vitamin A supplementation was
only a few months, and the outcome was measured a few months after that, in the Progresa
paper, the interval between the transfer and the weather shock was at least a decade. The
temporal gap between the first and the second event may be relevant to identifying these
interactions, as there may be behavioral responses from parents or teachers that could either
reinforce or undo the impacts of the first or the second event, or both.
Rossin-Slater and Wust (2015) consider a somewhat different, but related and very
important question of how different types of common public early interventions interact. They
use Danish registry data to study the interaction of a nurse home visiting program that supplies
visits shortly after birth, and a childcare program for three-year-old children. Both programs
rolled out beginning in the 1930s and ending in the 1950s. They find that the childcare program
had large and persistent effects on educational attainment and income, and reduced adult
mortality. In an innovative twist, they also find that the benefits extended inter-generationally to
the children of the originally treated children.
A surprising finding however given the dynamic complementarities hypothesis, is that the
effects of child care programs were largest for children who had not had exposure to the nurse
home visiting program as newborns. At first blush this finding seems the opposite of the “skills
beget skills” concept that children who got off to a good start due to the home visitors would be
better able to benefit from the child care program. A possible explanation is that the programs
actually provide similar but complementary services. For instance, home visiting often focuses
36
!
!

on training parents about health and safety, as well as teaching them what they can expect
developmentally from children of various ages. To the extent that a successful program trained
parents to give better care at home, that might lesson the benefit of having better care in another
setting. We are not aware of other studies of this type, so it is impossible to know how much the
complementarities depend on the type of intervention, though it is reasonable to suppose that
they would. Regardless, this handful of early two-shock studies establishes that estimating
dynamic complementarities in a well-identified way is feasible with enough creativity and luck.
Section 5: How Do Resources Mediate the Effect of Early Life Events?
Broadly considered, there are two types of resources that can be expected to benefit
children: Material resources (Y) and time inputs (It), which might be an argument in the
production of child investments. In addition, parents of higher “quality” may be expected to
make better use, on average, of the resources at their disposal (indeed, perhaps this should be
considered as part of a definition of parent quality along with evidence of altruistic preferences
towards the child). In equation (1), the productivity parameter A might be indexed by parental
type, with

, where H represents “high” quality and L represents “low” quality. At the

same levels of income, type “H” parents could achieve better child outcomes (and higher
consumption) than type “L” parents. As we discussed above, one might think of higher quality
parents as having access to a different production function than other parents. Accordingly, in
this section we focus on policies that affect parental education as well as income and in-kind
support and parental leave policy.
a) Effects of Material Resources

37
!
!

Many recent papers examine the effects of cash transfers on child outcomes in a range of
settings. We can think of these policies as exogenously increasing Y, which according to (3),
would increase both childhood investments and consumption. Aizer et al. (2016) assemble
unique historical administrative data about the U.S. mother’s Pension Program (a precursor to
modern welfare programs). They ask whether being accepted into the program affected
outcomes observable on WWII enlistment records or mortality risk (measured using age of death
on death certificates). They find that being accepted increased longevity by 1.5 years on
average, with larger effects in the poorest families.
Two papers, by Hoynes, Miller, and Simon (2015) and Dahl and Lochner (2012) examine
the effect of the U.S. Earned Income Tax Credit Program (EITC). Although it is administered
through the tax system, these refundable tax credits function rather like a Conditional Cash
Transfer program in that they are mainly available to families who work and file a tax return, that
is, they are conditional on working. Both papers exploit variation stemming from a significant
increase in the generosity of the program in the mid-90s. The first study finds reductions in the
incidence of low birth weight among mothers who benefited from the expansion while pregnant,
while the second finds increases in a range of cognitive test scores, which are larger for children
from the most disadvantaged families. One possible mechanism contributing to these effects is
the positive link between EITC and mother’s health (Evans and Garthwaite, 2014).
Black et al. (2014) and Milligan and Stabile (2011) consider cash transfers that are
targeted to children (a child care subsidy and a child allowance, respectively). Like Dahl and
Lochner, both also find significant improvements in a range of cognitive test scores. Milligan
and Stabile find that these effects are mainly driven by boys.

Set against these generally positive findings is the paper by Del Boca, Flinn, and Wiswall
(2014) which estimates a structural model based on observational data from a variety of data
sets. Their estimates suggest that monetary transfers will likely have only small effects on
children because most of the transfer is likely to be spent on other types of consumption, or on
parental leisure. However, they are not measuring the effects of an actual transfer policy using
design-based variation in that policy.
A second group of papers looks “near cash” programs supplying food aid. It is often
argued that if the amount of an in-kind transfer is small relative to the household’s budget for
that item, then in-kind transfers will have much the same impact as cash. The studies of the U.S.
Food Stamp program (now known as SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) by
Almond, Hoynes, and Schazenbach (2011) and Hoynes, Schazenbach, and Almond (2016) find
(respectively) that the roll out of the program increased birth weights, especially among African
Americans, and that in the long-term the roll out reduced the incidence of metabolic syndrome
(i.e., obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, etc.) which in turn increased the economic selfsufficiency.
Rossin-Slater (2013) examines the opposite type of policy, which is closures of clinics
providing WIC (Supplemental Nutrition for Women, Infants, and Children) in Texas in the late
2000s. WIC closures reduced WIC participation, reduced the probability that a mother gained an
adequate amount of weight during pregnancy, and reduced birth weight. Similarly, Meckel
(2015) finds that crackdowns on WIC fraud caused small retailers to exit the program and
reduced mother’s prenatal participation in WIC with negative effects on birth outcomes.

A number of studies look at the broader effects of economic circumstances on child
outcomes. Arguably, good economic times may have effects not only through increasing family
resources but also through increasing employment (with either positive or negative effects for
children depending on the range of child care options available) and social resources. For
example, more money may flow to schools and social services in good times. Hence, studies of
the effects of business cycles may not tell us about precise mechanisms, though they do once
again suggest the vulnerability of young children. The studies by Loken, Mogstad, and Wiswall
(2012) and Adhvaryu et al. (2016) examine the oil boom in Norway and a cocoa price boom in
Ghana, respectively. These find positive effects of good times with the impacts being felt
disproportionately in low-income households.
Lindo (2011) and Carlson (2015) examine the effects of job displacement during
pregnancy on health at birth outcomes. Lindo focuses on the father’s job loss using data from
the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and controlling for mother fixed-effects. Carlson uses data
from!notices filed under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act aggregated at
the county-month data to examine the effect of anticipated job losses. Both studies find negative
effects on birth weight. Golberstein et al. (2016) go beyond examining effects on health at birth
and examine children’s mental health. The paper finds that a one standard deviation increase in
the state unemployment rate has a negative impact on child’s mental health (assessed using the
Child Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire) and is associated with a 5.7% increase in the use
of special education services for emotional problems. Given the nature of the shock examined
(i.e., the Great Recession) and the magnitude of the effects on clinically meaningful outcomes, it
would be interesting to know whether these impacts will persist over time.

40

Bharadwaj, Lundborg, and Rooth (2014) ask how low birth weight affects vulnerability
to economic shocks later in life using Swedish administrative data and models with twin fixed
effects. Their estimates suggest that a 10% increase in birth weight results in a one percent
decline in the probability of using unemployment insurance during a recession as an adult.
Conversely, using Dutch data, Scholte et al. (2015) find that individuals subjected to economic
downturns early in life are more likely to have chronic diseases and functional limitations in old
age.
Two studies by Gould, Lavy, and Paserman (2011) and Lavy, Schlosser, and Shany
(2016) study the children of Ethiopian Jews who were air-lifted to Israel either as young
children, or while in utero. Those children air-lifted to Israel experienced large differences in
material conditions depending on where their families were assigned, and families had little say
in this decision. Children who had running water, sanitation, and electricity in early childhood
obtained more education, were more likely to be employed, and were less likely to have health
problems in later life. Children air-lifted while in utero, faced different conditions during their
mother’s pregnancy compared to children air-lifted shortly after birth. Those children who
experienced Israel’s better conditions prior to 8 weeks of gestation did better on standardized
tests and obtained more education. Perhaps curiously, these studies both find that the effects
were concentrated mainly among girls. They attribute this finding to gender discrimination,
particularly in Ethiopia and in the more backward parts of Israel. The idea is that parents would
have been more likely to stint girls, so girls are particularly benefitted by relaxation of resource
constraints. If this explanation is correct, then the result highlights the fact that the effects of a
shock reflect both “biological” effects and the influence of social conditions, and that it is
difficult to disentangle the two.
41

Rossin-Slater (2016) highlights a very different type of policy which also had the
capacity to change many aspects of a child’s living situation: Changes in U.S. laws governing
paternity establishment. Many states adopted policies aimed at making it easier to establish
paternity in the hospital. A goal of these changes was to encourage parents to marry. Since
married families are generally better off than single-parent households, such a policy might be
expected to increase the resources available to children (both in terms of income and possibly
father’s time). However, Rossin-Slater argues that any positive effect on marriage rates was
offset by the fact that the law also made it easier for some mothers to gain child-support without
marrying the father. Overall, she finds little effect on measures of paternal involvement or child
health, but some negative effect on children’s health insurance coverage and utilization of
medical care, which may be a result of losing access to paternal employer-sponsored health
insurance coverage. This is one of very few studies to explicitly consider the role of fathers in
providing resources to households, something that it would be useful to see more of.
Chetty, Hendren, and Katz (2016) focus on the Moving-to-Opportunity (MTO)
experiment that randomly offered families living in housing projects vouchers that enabled them
to move. Combining MTO experimental data with administrative data from federal tax returns,
the authors find significant differences in the later-life outcomes of children who moved when
they were less than 13 years old. Moving to a lower-poverty neighborhood improved college
attendance rates by 15% and earnings by 14%. Treated children were also 4% more likely to live
in better neighborhoods as adults and 15% less likely to become single parents. In contrast,
children who moved later in their adolescence either did not benefit or actually faced negative
long-term impacts. One potential explanation for these differential effects is that moving to a
very different environment as an adolescent could disrupt social networks and have other adverse
42
!
!

effects on child development. The authors discuss potential intergenerational gains to providing
access to better neighborhoods to families in public housing, which ultimately could generate
positive of these policies returns for taxpayers.
b) Policies to Promote Maternity Leave
If childhood investments are an increasing function of parental time, then maternity leave
policies may increase investments at key developmental stages. Such policies appear to be
predicated on the belief that the elasticity of child investments in (1) with respect to parental time
is large in very early childhood. The key policy question is when specifically maternal (or
paternal) time is most important? Recent studies focusing on the effects of maternity leave policy
on child outcomes are summarized in Panel B of Table 4. At first glance it is difficult to see any
consistent picture in these estimates. However, on closer examination, a story emerges in which
facilitating short maternity leaves is highly beneficial, but extended maternity leaves do not have
a positive effect. This pattern seems plausible if child investments are an increasing but concave
function of maternal time or if the return to childhood investments is diminishing in the
investment level.
Rossin-Slater (2011) studies the implementation of the Family and Medical Leave Act in
the U.S., a federal law allowing women to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid maternity leave. The
law superseded a patchwork of state laws, creating a good deal of variation which she exploits.
She finds a positive effect on the birth outcomes of college educated women. These women are
more likely than less educated women to have been able to afford to take unpaid leave. Similarly,
Carneiro, Loken, and Salvanes (2015) study the effect of a 1977 Norwegian law which replaced
a legal right to 12 weeks of unpaid leave with four months of paid leave and an additional right
43
!
!

to take 12 months of unpaid leave. They find that children of affected mothers got more
education and had higher wages at age 30. Thus it appears that allowing some maternity leave in
the first months of life was associated with better outcomes in these two examples.
In contrast, Baker and Milligan (2015), Danzer and Lavy (2016), and Dahl et al. (2016)
study expansions of paid leave from 25 weeks to 50 weeks, 12 months to 24 months, and 18
weeks to 35 weeks, respectively. Baker and Milligan (2015) actually find some evidence of
negative effects on children’s test scores among boys and among children of more educated
mothers. Dahl et al. (2016) find no effects on adult outcomes. Danzer and Lavy (2016) do not
find any overall effect, but report that there was some benefit to the reform for children of more
highly educated mothers, but negative effects among children of less educated mothers. Thus,
although there is some disagreement about the magnitude and direction of effects, there is little
evidence in any of these studies that long maternal leaves have overall benefits for children. One
possible interpretation is that mothers who go back to work after the first six months manage, on
average, to find child care that approximates the care they would offer in their own homes.
c)! Policies to Promote Child Care
Panel C of Table 4 reviews recent work on the feasibility of investing in young children
through organized child care. These studies are organized into three categories: Long-term
follow-ups of small-scale demonstration programs; long-term follow-ups of large, publicly
funded programs; and short-term results of more recent demonstration programs.
There is a good deal of previous work showing long-term effects of small-scale child care
demonstration programs conducted using randomized controlled trials including Perry Preschool
and the Carolina Abcedarian Program. We have reviewed these programs extensively
44
!
!

elsewhere.14 Suffice it to say here, these studies involved interventions of medium and strong
intensity (respectively) with groups of very disadvantaged preschool children. At the time these
demonstrations took place the alternative was generally no preschool, rather than some other
type of preschool, which is the default today.
Studies by Heckman, Pinto and Savelyev (2013), Campbell et al. (2014), and Conti,
Heckman, and Pinto (2015) add to this literature by showing that the interventions had positive
effects on a broader set of outcomes than had previously been considered. In particular, they
find positive effects on personality traits, health behaviors, and health outcomes. All of these
measures have been shown to have important impacts on employment and earnings, though the
focus in evaluations of early childhood interventions is often solely on test scores. These studies
also take care to correct their estimates for complexities such as attrition and imperfect random
assignment, as well as for multiple hypothesis testing (i.e., the problem that if you test 20
hypotheses, it is likely that one of them will fail to be rejected with 95% confidence even if there
are in fact no underlying causal relationships). It is increasingly well understood that it can be
difficult to interpret results from some randomized experiments given these sorts of problems.
A second set of studies extend the large literature on the effects of public preschool
programs in various ways. Havnes and Mogstad (2015) examine the effect of a Norwegian
reform that extended publicly funded preschools. The availability of preschool varied across
space and time, and the authors exploit this variation to identify its effects. A striking finding is
that the reform increased the eventual adult earnings of affected children in the poorest
households, but reduced the earnings of affected children in the richest households. The paper is
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

For instance, Almond and Currie (2011b) review some of the studies evaluating these programs in Table 11, p.
1435.

45

therefore a very nice demonstration of the fact that childcare centers do not exist in a vacuum—
hours in child care replace some other form of care for the child. If the care that is replaced is
worse than the child care center, then one can expect improvements in child outcomes and vice
versa. Of course income matters too. To the extent that child care allows women to work and
earn more, their higher earnings may also benefit their children and could possibly offset a mild
negative direct effect of child care. One would expect the marginal value of additional earnings
to be higher in lower income households, even though more educated women are likely to earn
more per hour.
A recent study by Baker, Gruber, and Milligan (2015) showed that the introduction of a
universal child care program in Quebec led to negative effects on children’s non-cognitive
outcomes (with little gain in cognitive test scores), significant declines in long term self-reported
health and life-satisfaction, and behavioral problems and criminal activity among boys. These
results are quite consistent with those of Havnes and Mogstad because the modal child who was
brought into child care as a result of the reform was a middle class child who went into a lowquality, hurriedly-created, child care facility.
Aizer and Cunha (2014), Gelber and Isen (2013), and Kline and Walters (2016) examine
the U.S. Head Start program, a publicly funded program that originally served 3 to 5 year old
children, but has increasingly served younger children as well. Aizer and Cunha (2014) focus on
the roll out of Head Start in the mid-1960s using data from the National Collaborative Perinatal
Project and find that children who were able to participate in Head Start had test scores that were
0.1 to 0.2 standard deviations higher at age 7 than those of their older siblings. However, like the
parenting intervention studied by Fryer, Levitt, and List (2015), the effect was greatest for the
46
!
!

children with the highest initial endowments. Aizer and Cunha also examine the compensation
vs. reinforcement question, and find that in this low-resource setting, parents invested more in
highly-endowed children and that parental investments complemented investments from Head
Start. Gelber and Isen (2013) focus on parenting practices in Head Start cohorts from the early
2000s who were followed as part of the Head Start Impact Study, a randomized controlled trial
intended to examine the short-run impacts of Head Start. They also find that Head Start
enrollment tended to increase parental investments.
Kline and Walters (2016) offer a re-examination of data from the Head Start Impact
Study. Original analyses found that Head Start had some positive effects on children in the short
run, but that these effects quickly “faded out.” Kline and Walters point out that about a third of
the children treated in the Head Start Impact Study were drawn from other publicly-funded
preschool programs and that many of the controls attended other public preschools. One would
not necessarily expect to see any difference between Head Start children and children in other
similar public preschool programs. Ignoring this fact substantially overstates the cost of
providing Head Start to the study children (since a third of them would have been receiving
preschool at public expense anyway), and also understates the positive effects of attending a
public preschool of some sort; Hence naive estimates substantially understate the costeffectiveness of the program. Using estimates from previous work showing that short-term
boosts in test scores are associated with long-term gains in outcomes (e.g., Garces et al, 2002;
Chetty et al, 2011), they estimate that Head Start is likely to be a cost effective program.
Interestingly, the eligible children who were not participating in the early 2000s were those with
the highest potential benefits, suggesting that expansions that drew these children into care could
be even more cost effective.
47
!
!

A common theme in these studies of public preschool programs in developed country
settings is that a failure to consider the available alternatives to child care programs leads
analysts to understate the positive social returns to expanding these programs.
A third group of recent studies (all randomized controlled trials) examine preschool
programs in developing countries. The two papers by Attanasio and collaborators examine the
effects of a home based psychosocial intervention program and a center-based preschool
program that was implemented in poor Colombian towns. Both interventions find positive
effects, though on different domains (cognitive test scores and height-for-age, respectively).
Perhaps the main take away is that such publicly funded, large-scale programs can have positive
effects even in very low resource settings. Gertler, Heckman, and Pinto et al. (2014) examine the
long-term effects of an intervention to provide psychosocial stimulation to impoverished
Jamaican children. An ambitious aspect of this project is that they attempted to track migrants,
pointing out that in Jamaica, many successful people emigrate and are lost to follow up unless
special care is taken to retain them in the study. This study finds large effects of the
psychosocial intervention on adult earnings.
Taken as a whole, the studies summarized in Panel C of Table 4 add to the extensive
literature on the potential for early intervention programs to improve children’s short and longrun outcomes. Both high quality center-based programs and home visiting interventions appear
to be effective and have the potential to influence many domains, including education, income,
employment, health, and future health behaviors (see Almond and Currie, 2011b for a review of
work on this topic before 2011).
d)! Policies to Promote Medical Care
48
!
!

Much of the literature on the long-term effects of medical care in childhood exploits the
revolutionary expansions of public health insurance (Medicaid) coverage to children in poor and
near poor families that occurred in the U.S. during the 1980s and 1990s. But other rich countries
have also made efforts to improve medical care for young children, and some of these
investments have also been evaluated. Recent studies of the issue are reviewed in Panel D of
Table 4.
One noteworthy study by Sievertsen and Wust (2015) uses rich administrative registry
data from Denmark and exploits county-by-county variation policies mandating same-day postbirth discharge. Same-day discharge following normal deliveries was apparently implemented as
a cost saving measure in a staggered way across Danish counties. They find that same-day
discharge leads to a 75% increase in readmissions during the first month of life and also
increases contacts with general practitioners. The largest effects are found for disadvantaged
mothers (defined in terms of age, education, and income). The authors are able to link
administrative data sets together in order to examine long-term effects of this policy change on
9th grade test scores. They find that the policy was associated with a .2 standard deviation
decline in test scores in children born to disadvantaged mothers. While modest, this effect is in
line with the effect sizes seen in many educational interventions and highlights the interrelationship of health and cognitive achievement.
Bharadwaj, Loken, and Neilson (2013) examine infants in Chile and Norway and exploit
the fact that infants below the 1500g threshold cutoff used to define very low birth weight
received more intensive medical services than those just above this threshold. In addition to

49
!
!

finding significant effects on infant mortality in each country, they also find that more intensive
medical care increased adult wages by 2.7% in Chile and by 1.8% in Norway.
Studies of the U.S. Medicaid expansions use a variety of methodologies and data sets, but
generally rely on the fact that the Medicaid expansions were phased in at different rates across
the states (although the expansions eventually became mandatory in every state). Brown,
Kowalski, and Lurie (2015) use U.S. Internal Revenue data from tax returns which allows them
to examine income and payroll taxes as well as college attendance as outcomes. Cohodes et al.
(2016) use publicly available data from the Census, the Current Population Survey, and the
Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System to examine effects on educational attainment. Meyer
and Wherry (2016) and Miller and Wherry (2014) examine effects on mortality using Vital
Statistics data and on obesity, body mass index, and hospitalizations for endocrine disorders
using data from the NHIS, while Wherry et al. (2015) look at hospitalizations and Emergency
Room visits using hospital discharge data.
All of these studies find positive long-term effects of having been eligible for health
insurance coverage in childhood, suggesting that improved access to medical care in childhood
increases the health and productivity of adults. These findings are significant as Medicaid is
possibly the largest U.S. policy engaging “fetal origins” linkages, and represents one of the
largest social investments that has been made in U.S. children. There is some heterogeneity in
the estimated long-term effects. The effects are strongest for African Americans (who were most
strongly affected by the expansions, given their lower average incomes and resulting higher
eligibility for public insurance). Brown et al. do not see race in the tax data, but find stronger
effects on earnings among women than among men. The take away from these studies is that
50
!
!

even in rich countries where much of the morbidity is due to behavioral factors rather than
infectious disease, improvements in access to medical care matter for long-term outcomes,
especially among the disadvantaged.
e) Maternal Education
In Grossman (1972), more educated individuals are more efficient producers of health.
Analogously here, it may be the case that better educated parents have A=

, which would

yield higher child outcomes h, other things equal. As Currie and Moretti (2003) point out,
maternal education is endogenously chosen, and has possible effects on many aspects of a
woman’s life,15 including fertility choices. McCrary and Royer (2011) and Carneiro, Meghir,
and Parey (2012) examine the effect of policies that affected the amount of maternal education.
The first paper exploits discontinuities created by rules about age-at-school entry. The idea is
that children who are slightly too young to enter school must wait a year and will be in lower
grades when they reach the age at which they can legally leave school causing the marginal
children to end up with less education than children who were just above the age cutoff for
school entry. McCrary and Royer find little overall effect of additional compulsory education on
either fertility or infant health, though for African-American women, they do find some
reduction in the incidence of low birth weight.
This result contrasts with Currie and Moretti, who examined the effect of additional years
of college education induced by having a college open in the mother’s county when she was 17
years old. These openings were associated with large improvements in infant health, possibly
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
15

!There is no time budget in our stylized model. Were labor income a function of hours worked, then another
margin for optimization would presumably be through the shadow price of parental time spent on investing in
children. Increases in education could increase the return to work and shadow price of time spent investing in
children, with ambiguous predictions on net investments given competing income and substitution effects.!!!!

51
!
!

through the mechanism of reducing maternal smoking. McCrary and Royer study a different
margin (years of high school) and find no effect on smoking, so a possible explanation for these
conflicting results is that the studies are looking at different margins presumably affecting
different parts of the distribution of potential mothers. Carneiro et al. (2012) also focus on
college education and instrument for education using variables such as tuition and distance to
college. They find positive effects on child test scores, with slightly larger effects for African
Americans.
In order to place these results in context, it is important to note that the fraction of U.S.
women with less than a high school degree has fallen by more than 50% in the last 25 years, and
there is increasing evidence that high school dropouts and those with only a high school degree
fare similarly in the labor market (Card, 2009). Hence, college may be the key margin for
maternal education to affect child health in the United States.
Section 6: The Missing Middle and Latent Effects
In order to examine the long-term impact of policies experienced as young children,
researchers must wait patiently to observe a “fully formed” measure of h. For example, Hoynes
et al. (2016), Dahl et al. (2016), and Isen, Rossin-Slater, and Walker (2016) study the impact of
policies that were rolled out 30 to 40 years ago. In addition to the usual difficulties identifying
policy effects, these studies must address the problems involved in tracking affected people or
cohorts over decades. In the case of Hoynes et al. (2016) the problem was addressed by gaining
restricted-access information on county of residence over time in the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics, while the other two studies rely on administrative records that geocode county of
birth.
52
!
!

Clearly, while long-term follow up is the most reliable way to assess whether a policy is
effective in the long-term, it limits our ability to assess current or even recent policies within a
reasonable amount of time. While economists may be particularly interested in adult productivity
and earnings, skipping the middle years between early childhood and adulthood means that we
have little idea about what typical developmental trajectories look like and how they are shaped
by policies experienced over the life course. If we knew more about the relationship between
early childhood, middle-childhood, and adulthood, it would aid us in making medium-term
inferences about those early childhood policies that are likely to successfully impact adults. Our
lack of knowledge also means that we are largely shooting in the dark when trying to compare
the efficacy of programs targeted at very young children to those targeting older children.
While there is a wide-spread perception that it is more cost-effective to focus on the very young,
there is surprisingly little direct comparison of policies targeting different age groups.
An additional reason to be interested in the middle years, is that the limited amount that
we do know presents some real puzzles. For instance, a common finding in the literature
evaluating early childhood intervention programs is that there is an immediate gain in test scores,
followed by “fade out” of test score gains in the early elementary school years (Almond and
Currie, 2011b; Currie and Thomas, 1995). However, these same children tracked many years
later often show positive effects of the intervention in terms of completed schooling attainment
and other measures (Garces et al, 2002). Are the initial test score effects a “red herring” in that
the intervention is really affecting something else that matters for future development (such as
non-cognitive skills)? Or do the initial effects on cognition simply become latent for some
period of time and re-emerge?

53
!
!

In many cases, data on the “missing middle” is simply unavailable. For instance, Isen,
Rossin-Slater, and Walker know where people were born, and link information about their birth
counties to their adult earnings records. Their data has no information on movement patterns
between birth and adulthood, which is perhaps something that could be examined using tax
records, as in Chetty et al. (2016). However, a few recent papers have begun to examine the
effects of events in early childhood on outcomes during the school years.
A few of these papers have already been discussed. For example, in student register data
for Pakistani and Bangladeshi families in England, Almond et al. (2015) examined whether
Ramadan's overlap with pregnancy affects subsequent academic outcomes at age 7. They find
that test scores are 0.05 to 0.08 standard deviations lower for students exposed to Ramadan in
early pregnancy.
A few additional studies focusing on middle childhood are summarized in Table 5.
Figlio et al. (2014) use the universe of births in Florida matched to data from standardized tests.
They find that in models with twin fixed effects, increases in birth weight are associated with
higher performance. The estimates are slightly smaller than those found in Black, Devereux, and
Salvanes (2007) who conducted a similar investigation in Norway. Bharadwaj, Eberhard, and
Neilson (2013) report very similar findings for Chile. A further interesting result is that the
effects of low birth weight are largely stable between the ages of 9 and 14 in Florida, and
between 1st and 12th grade in Chile.
Another approach to the problem of measuring trajectories is to try to develop better
measures of fetal damage, i.e., quantifying

and

. We know for example, that low birth

weight is an extremely crude measure of fetal damage, which while predictive, is certainly not
54
!
!

dispositive. There are babies who were low birth weight who seem to be just fine ex-post, and
many babies who are not low birth weight but who nonetheless have developmental problems.
Robinson (2012) attempts to distinguish between “brain sparing” forms of low birth weight, and
low birth weight that is associated with evidence of brain damage. He does this largely by
focusing on head circumference, which may feel uncomfortably close to the preoccupations of
early eugenicists. His estimates suggest that there are no cognitive effects of low birth weight in
the infants with brain sparing. However, his low birth weight infants were more likely than
normal weight siblings to have congenital malformations, and vision, hearing, or speech
abnormalities regardless of head circumference. Biomedicine has proposed some intriguing
alternative metrics to birth weight, e.g., telomere length, methylation patterns, etc., but none that
have gained widespread acceptance as yet.
The multidimensional nature of both investments (I) and outcomes (h) (Heckman, 2007)
is one reason for the measurement problem. It is unclear whether any unidimensional metric will
ever fully capture the effects of early childhood policies and investments insofar as they will
impact later life outcomes. At present, waiting until cohorts reach adulthood to observe effects
remains useful, though it is severely limiting. For example, how do we know today whether
policy A or B will have bigger long-term effects? Presumably this is where a structural, wellcalibrated model of investments in early childhood and human capital formation could help to fill
the gaps in our knowledge. In addition, a potential avenue of research could be the development

55
!
!

of “sufficient statistics” to identify key reduced-form elasticities that summarize the human
capital effects of early life shocks or investments.16, 17
Section 7: Discussion and Conclusions
We now know that variegated shocks, some of them relatively mild and brief, can have
lasting measurable impacts on child outcomes. Many authors start from the basic, scientific
perspective of asking whether shock X has a casual effect on outcome Y. While that is an
important question, it is reasonable to ask whether, given all of this research, we can say
anything yet about the relative magnitudes of the effects and in particular, about which
investments and interventions would be most cost effective in terms of improving young
children’s future outcomes? Answering this question is hampered by the wide range of both
shocks and outcomes that have been considered. However, at this point a large number of
studies have examined three types of outcomes: Birth weight (and low birth weight), test scores,
and wages -- three outcomes that offer glimpses of an individual’s well-being at birth, in
childhood, and in adulthood.
Table 6 summarizes what some of these studies have found. These estimates do not lend
themselves to comparative analysis of cost-effectiveness. For one thing, we do not have
estimates of what it would cost to prevent or ameliorate some types of shocks such as stress due
to a death in the family or domestic violence. Still, given what we know about interventions that

Bleakley (2010), for instance, showed that years of schooling is not a sufficient statistic for measuring the impact
of early-life health on lifetime income as it is possible that when health improves, lifetime income goes up, but years
of schooling declines.
17
The use of sufficient statistics has been relatively common in other fields of economics such as in public finance,
for welfare analysis. For instance, Chetty (2009) showed that in order to calculate the welfare impact of a tax
policy, one only needs to estimate the elasticity of equilibrium quantity with respect to the tax rate and avoid
estimating all the “primitive” parameters in a structural model.

are feasible and a rough idea about the likely costs of intervention, the table can serve as a
starting point for a discussion about what interventions appear to be most promising.
Studies that focus on birth weight as an outcome are shown in Panel A. Unfortunately,
we don’t know whether small changes in birth weight for babies well above the cutoff for low
birth weight will have meaningful effects on future adult outcomes. Studies that focus on effects
on mean birth weight can answer the rudimentary question of whether a given shock affects the
fetus, but are not necessarily well suited to considering the cost effectiveness of intervention
because we don’t know how much a small change in the entire distribution of birth weight is
likely to be worth.
On the other hand, we do know that low birth weight is associated in a meaningful way
with future outcomes such as adult health, schooling attainment, and wages (see for example,
Bharadwaj, Lundborg, and Rooth, 2014; Bharadwaj, Eberhard, and Neilson, 2013; Figlio,
Guryan, Karbownik, and Roth, 2014). Table 6 suggests that there is low hanging fruit in terms
of potential for meaningful interventions to reduce the incidence of low birth weight. For
example, Schwandt (2016) finds that reducing severe influenza cases among pregnant women
would have a meaningful effect on the incidence of low birth weight (and on children’s future
wages). This goal could be accomplished quite cheaply by promoting immunization for
influenza among women of child bearing age.
Hoynes, Miller, and Simon (2015), Almond, Hoynes, and Schazenbach (2011), and
Rossin-Slater (2013) find that small increases in annual income (or equivalent in-kind transfers)
have relatively large impacts on the incidence of low birth weight, which suggests that some sort
of pregnancy bonus or mother’s allowance might have positive effects at a modest cost

(compositional effects aside). Another policy which could accomplish the same thing though
perhaps at higher cost is paid maternity leave, which would be particularly valuable if it covered
some of the prenatal period (Rossin-Slater, 2011).
Conversely, uncertainty about income seems to be extremely harmful (Carlson, 2015). It
isn’t clear at this point how much this problem could be mitigated by expanding unemployment
insurance, or at what cost. For example, we don’t know how many pregnant women or their
partners now qualify for unemployment insurance (UI) or how much they typically receive in
benefits. Lindo (2011) finds extremely negative effects of paternal unemployment, though
again, it is not clear what policy response could best prevent or address this. This result does
point to the importance of fathers, a topic that has generally been neglected in the literature.
Currie and Walker (2011) and Currie et al. (2013) show that exposure to pollution during
pregnancy has particularly negative effects on the developing fetus. The cost of pollution control
varies greatly depending on exactly how it is done. One option that has not been explored a
great deal to date is the potential role of zoning to keep residences, schools, and child care
centers away from sources of pollution such as busy highways. Over time, zoning changes
might accomplish a lot in terms of health protection at a relatively modest cost. Improvements in
filtration by daycare and school HVAC systems are probably cheaper still.
The second panel of Table 6 briefly summarizes shocks that have been shown to affect
future test scores. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the same things that have an impact on low birth
weight often have significant impacts on test scores. Black et al. (2014), Milligan and Stabile
(2011), Dahl and Lochner (2012) all show that small increases in annual income in childhood has
measurable effects on children’s test scores. Sanders (2012), Bharadwaj et al. (2016), and Black,
58
!
!

Butikofer, Devereux, and Salvanes (2014) further explore the effects of pollution, while Aizer,
Stroud, and Buka (2016) highlight negative effects of maternal stress during pregnancy on test
scores.
Almond, Mazumder, and Van Ewikjk (2015) and Greve, Shultz-Nielsen, and Tekin
(2015) focus particularly on mild nutritional deprivation during pregnancy and find large
negative effects on test scores. It would be particularly interesting to tie this literature on mild
nutritional deprivation together with the literature on nutritional supplementation (e.g., analyses
of the U.S. WIC program) to draw inferences about the potential effects of small variations in
nutrition during pregnancy.
Turning to shocks in early childhood that have been shown to impact the wages of young
adults, panel C of Table 6 points once again to some of the same suspects. Policies to improve
immunization for influenza (Schwandt, 2016), reduce alcohol consumption in pregnant women
(Nilsson, 2015), and reduce exposure to pollution (Isen et al., 2015) hold considerable promise.
Maternity leave in very early childhood (Carneiro et al., 2015), child care subsidies (Havnes and
Mogstad, 2011), and health insurance coverage for young children (Brown et al., 2015) all
appear to have payoffs down the road. The Gertler et al. (2014) study of psychosocial
stimulation applies to very disadvantaged children in a developing country. Yet there may be
parallels to nurse home visiting programs that target disadvantaged parents in the U.S. and many
developed countries.
Clearly, we cannot pin down specific cost-benefit ratios without a lot more information.
But arguably we have still learned quite a bit about the types of interventions that could be
expected to make children healthier, smarter, and more productive as adults.
59

That said, there remains a great deal of room for future research. More progress could
be achieved if some of the measurement problems could be addressed. Some of our most widely
used measures, such as low birth weight, are at best only proxies for a whole range of subtle
damages that a developing fetus may have suffered. Without sensitive and specific “real time”
measures of how someone has been harmed, and how interventions are affecting them, all we
can do is wait and see what the eventual outcome will be. In addition to specific measures of
harms, knowing more about how intermediate outcomes are affected could help us to identify
individuals in need of assistance more quickly, and to target interventions more effectively.
Similarly, being able to identify sensitive or critical periods when particular shocks have
their greatest impact, would be extremely helpful. To date, we have learned that the in utero
period is itself an especially critical and sensitive period of an individual’s life. But breaking this
period down further and learning more about critical periods in early childhood would also be
extremely useful. If the early stages of pregnancy matter most, does starting WIC a few weeks
earlier have a high return? Does fostering earlier recognition of pregnancies help?
Another area that could benefit from more precise measurement concerns the
development of non-cognitive skills. A few of the studies discussed above focus on noncognitive skills, and there is growing evidence that such “soft” skills matter a great deal in terms
of producing “hard” outcomes such as educational attainment and employment. Yet these skills
are typically represented by a hodge-podge of different measures that happen to be available to
researchers and there is no consensus as yet on which measures are best or how to get a
comprehensive overview of an individual’s non-cognitive skills.

60

We have emphasized that there is often considerable heterogeneity in the effects of a
given shock. Most often, more disadvantaged people suffer greater harms, though not always. It
is perfectly reasonable that there should be heterogeneous effects given differences in
endowments, budget constraints, and available production technologies. Yet in many cases
effective interventions may depend on knowing the source of the heterogeneity, something we
can largely only speculate about now. Moreover, as we have discussed, families may act either
to magnify or mitigate the effects of initial shocks. Hence, a greater understanding of the way
that shocks and disadvantage interact, and of the role of parents in responding to them, is highly
desirable.
To date, most of the literature focuses on the role of mothers, largely because we have
had much better information about mothers than about fathers in many data sets. As large
administrative data sets have become increasingly available, it has become possible to explore
the role of fathers, but this exploration is only just beginning.
Similarly, improvements in the availability of data are making it possible to explore
intergenerational effects. Given evidence from animal models, it is highly likely that changes in
the fetus or young child could be passed on to the next generation. This type of mechanism
could offer an additional reason for the intergenerational persistence of poverty, and for the
existence of poverty traps in some disadvantaged areas.

Analyze the seasonality of health at birth by
comparing siblings conceived by the same
mother at different times using sibling FE.
Compare impact of coming to term in early
winter in high flu and low flu years.

Conception from Jan. to May is associated with
significant reductions in gestation (-0.08 week)
and prematurity within families:
+1pp (13.2%). Birth weight falls by -4gr (increases
by 8gr if conception occurs in June-August). More
severe flu seasons show stronger effects.
In children coming to term in high flu season the
risk of negative birth outcomes is much higher,
suggesting that exposure to flu late in pregnancy
causes preterm delivery.

more likely to be: “white college educated”
mothers: +10.1%.
Also, white college educated mothers are
more likely to leave an area when new

estimator (similar to an IV-FE that uses
prenatal inputs during earlier

differences in inputs between

is that prenatal inputs associated with a

Randomly assigned half of the
households to a treatment group that
received information about their
children’s recent achievement test
results in school, and half to a control
group, which did not receive
information

The information delivered to parents
about their children's academic abilities:
(1) Parents’ perceptions of their children’s
achievement diverges from children’s true
achievement: the gap is 1 SD.
(2) Parents reallocate educational
investments: Willingness-to-pay for
remedial math and English textbooks:
+1.3pp in subjects in which children were
doing worse than expected.
Free subject-specific workbooks (remedial,
average, advanced): parents shifted their
choices towards workbooks that
corresponded more closely to their
children’s true achievement level.

Poorer, less-educated
parents have less accurate
perceptions about their children’s
academic abilities than
richer, more-educated parents, and
update their beliefs more in response
to improved
information.

Formulate a model of early childhood
development in which mothers have
subjective
expectations about the tech. of skill
formation. Empirically, the identification
of the model poses a problem:
preferences and beliefs are confounded.
To solve this problem, authors create a
survey instrument to elicit maternal
expectations about the tech. of skill
formation. Mothers are asked: "what is
the youngest and oldest age at which
your baby will learn how to do task X or
Y?" (the tasks are taken from the
Motor‐Social Development Scale of the
CNLSY/79 and NHANES). Authors exploit
within‐family variation to estimate the
parameters of the technology of skill
formation.

1) Mothers underestimate the elasticity of NA
child development w.r.t. investments:
Mothers' subjective expectation about the
elasticity of their child developm't w.r.t.
investments is btw 4-19%, but authors
estimate ndicates elasticities btw 21-36%.
2) A policy that moved expectations from
the median to objective estimates would
increase investment by 4% to 24% and
stocks of cognitive skills 24 months would
increase by 1% to 5%. The impacts of such
a policy would be even higher for mothers
whose expectations were < the median.

Chinese parents
alter investments in
twins at ages 6-18
in response to the
serious illness of
one twin at age 03.

Chinese Child Twins Survey (CCTS);
includes detailed info on family
health & educ investments for
e/child; conducted in 2002 to 2003 in
the province of Kunming, China;
N=1,694 households with twins.

Early health shocks affect children both
biologically and by affecting parental
responses. Assume that "the withintwin variation in early health shocks is
random and exogenous."
To estimate effects of health shocks on
child's outcomes and address the
possibility that family investments may
be endogenous, authors use an IV based
on within-twin variations in BW, gender
and HH level variables (rural indicator,
maternal working sector, age, ethnicity,
and schooling).

When a twin child suffered from a serious
disease at ages 0-3:
Parental investments:
Health investments in the sick twin ($
spent on medical treatment, medicine,
health products): + RMB 305 (+$49 US)
(+35% = +0.39 SD).
Educational investments in the sick twin
(tuition + $ spent on books, stationery,
home tutors, tutoring class): RMD -182 ($30 US) (-20% = -0.15 SD).
Child outcome results suggest that
parental investments equalize health but
increase disparities in education in favor of
the healthier twin.

Rural areas: Increase in health
expenditures in favor of the sick twin
is not accompanied by a decrease in
educational expenditures.
Urban areas: the fall in educational
expenditures on the sick child offsets
the cost of medical expenses.
Compensating investments and
reinforcing educational investments
are more precisely determined
among high education mothers and in
female twins. Wealthier households
have more reinforcing educational
investments.

introduction of the Electronic Benefit Transfer
(EBT) that replaced paper vouchers.
DDD model: exploit variation in the exact timing
of EBT rollout across counties, years and months,
and WIC product and WIC store.

The anti-fraud reform:
(1) Eliminated most pre-existing fraud
among stores (violations declined 15%)
(2) Caused 10-26% of single outlets to
drop out of WIC (no change for chains)
(3) Reduced WIC participation among
eligible mothers by 3-5%
(4) Reduced the likelihood that a mother
has at least one WIC store in her ZIP
code (a fall of 10-25%)
(5) Increased the prices on WIC products
within single outlet WIC stores by 9%
(6) Reduced welfare by 3-4% of the
value of benefits received

The largest declines in WIC
participation among stores and women
occur in high-poverty ZIP codes.
Only fraudulent stores select into the
program in high-poverty areas,
suggesting that fraud implicitly
subsidizes program access in these
areas.

Assumption: the exact timing of EBT rollout is

Two strategies:
1) RD: comparing children of eligible mothers born just

expanded from 12 weeks unpaid to 4 months paid plus up
to 12 months unpaid.
2) DD: Treatment: Difference between mothers who had a
child in June and those who had a child in July 1977.
Control: Difference between mothers who had a child in
June and those who had a child in July of 1975, 1977, and
1978.

Children of mothers who benefited from
PAID maternity leave:
HS drop-out (refers to a 3 yr HS diploma): 2pp (-7% = -0.04 SD).
Ever started college (at age 30): +2pp (+5%
= 0.04 SD).
Wages (at age 30): +5% to +6.2%.

Children of less educated moms
experienced a higher decline in HS drop
out: (-3.6pp vs. -1.8pp), more college
attendence (+3pp vs. no effect), BUT no
effect on earnings by age 30 (children of

Re-examine the

Impact Study.
Account for
participation of
controls in other
preschool
programs.

The Head Start Impact Study was an
experiment in which some children
were treated with Head Start while
the controls were not. Many
controls were in other preschools.
Outcomes were measured in the fall
of 2002 (after their enrollment in
HS) and in the Spring of 2003, 2004,
2005, 2006 (N=4,061 children).

Conduct a calibration exercise that accounts
for the fact that ~1/3 of Head Start children
were drawn from another public preschool
setting. Thus, the cost of providing preschool
to these children is over-estimated if we
ignore this. Also assumes that the short-run
impacts of Head Start on test scores are the
best predictors of future outcomes, in line
with previous studies which have shown
initial "fade out" followed by long-term
effects.

Head Start is about as cost effective as other
publicly funded preschools, and under reasonable
assumptions, has positive rates of return. Ignoring
the fact that Head Start draws from other
preschools substantially overstates its cost.

2002-2008; database provided by the
Ministry of Educ. of Chile. Approximately
4 million students observed ~4 times.

Over time, depending on parental
preferences (compensatory or
reinforcing), test score diff's within sibling
or twin pairs will converge or diverge.
Parents may find it harder to invest
differentially in twins. Compare OLS,
sibling, and twin FE estimates.

A 10% increase in BW:
Math & language scores: +0.04 to 0.06
of a SD. Relationship is stable from 1st
grade through HS.
Being VLBW:
Math & language scores: -0.1 to -0.2 of

OLS & twins estimators are similar in
1st grade(~0.04 of a SD) but OLS
estimates decline over time (e.g., in 8th
grade the OLS estimate is 0.2 of a SD &
the twins estimate is 0.5 of a SD).
Authors claim this is explained by
parental investment.

By mother's educ: The relationship
btw BW & test scores for children
(twins) of mothers with & w/o a HS
degree is statistically identical (0.04
of a SD due to a 10% increase in
BW) - a possible explanation for this
result is that inequality aversion
does not vary by mom's education.
By SES: similar relationships in low
