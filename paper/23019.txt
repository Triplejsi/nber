Federal Funding of Doctoral Recipients: Results from new Linked Survey and Transaction
Data

ABSTRACT
Funding of research is critically important because it affects the flow of new, doctorally qualified
scientists into the workforce. This paper provides new insights into how survey data can be
combined with administrative records to examine the ways in which funding affects workforce
decisions. We show that NSF supports more graduate students per dollar spent than other federal
agencies. Not surprisingly, NIH heavily supports biology, health, and psychology PhDs, while
NSF heavily supports PhDs in engineering, the physical sciences, mathematics, and computer
science. Federal funding overall and by agency is related to who does research – a larger share of
doctoral recipients supported by NIH are women (50%), African American (2.6%) and Hispanic
(4.2%), compared to NSF, the Department of Defense (DOD) or the Department of Energy
(DOE). Finally, federal funding is highly correlated with the pipeline of researchers going into
different fields, particularly R&D fields, and the decision to pursue postdoctoral fellowships.

1. Introduction
“Instability in Federal funding .. affects the career trajectories of doctoral students, postdoctoral
workers, and researchers whose employment is often supported by federally funded research
grants. Recognizing that strong, steady increases in Federal R&D funding may not always be
feasible, it is important for Federal agencies, Congress, and research institutions to consider how
best to mitigate the adverse effects of budget conditions on career paths” ‐‐ National Science
Board, p26 (1)
Funding of research is critically important because it affects the flow of new, doctorally
qualified scientists into the workforce through several channels. It sets priorities for fields of
research graduate students work in. It supports the people working in those fields. It may
expand the pipeline of labor into the workforce by providing financial support for students who
might otherwise not be able to afford an education (2–4). While many reports have called for
new and better sources of data to better understand the processes whereby funding affects
these channels (5, 6), the complexity of the funding structure in many countries has made it
difficult to collect such data.
This paper provides new insights into how survey data can be combined with administrative
records to examine the ways in which funding affects workforce decisions. Although the
context is that of US federal funding, the approach can be applied to other countries, which
also have multiple sources of funds for students.
It provides an approach to filling the substantial data gaps (7), which have led to calls for new
data collection. It particularly points to the value of administrative records, which are often a
cheaper and more extensive way of collecting information than survey data alone (8). One goal
of this paper is to provide an early demonstration of the power of combining administrative
and survey data for science policy. Importantly, the linked survey and administrative data
approach is not limited to the U.S. Indeed, there are parallel efforts at various stages in Europe
and Australia. We see the potential of such an approach as being at least as great in Europe,
given the importance of research funding from multiple levels (e.g. the European Commission
and individual member states).
In particular, we demonstrate how multiple funding channels can be studied by bringing
together two disparate datasets: UMETRICS, which is generated from university payroll and
financial records, and the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), which is one of the most
important US survey datasets about the doctoral workforce, and which has a counterpart in
most European countries.
The results presented here cannot be derived from the separate datasets. The SED provides
information about research fields, the characteristics of the men and women in graduate
school, and the ways in which they are supported; the link to the UMETRICS data provides the
connection to the rich complexity of research funding. The SED in turn provides information
about the types of jobs that individuals get immediately after graduation.
2

We find that research funding is indeed rich and complex. No individual agency, looking at its
own data, can document how many doctoral recipients are supported by federal funds. Even
the dominant supporter of doctoral research, the National Science Foundation (NSF), provides
funds to just under one in five doctoral recipients. Even if agencies were able to provide
separate (and accurate) counts of how many doctoral recipients were supported by their
funding, the combined results would substantially overestimate how many total individuals
were supported and understate the amount of support they receive, because although almost
40% of doctoral recipients are supported by only one agency, almost 7% are supported by 2 and
some are supported by 3 or more. In other words, it is virtually impossible to rely on agency
databases to characterize the pipeline of doctoral recipients.
We also find large differences in the number and mix of disciplines supported by different
agencies. NSF supports more graduate students per dollar spent than other federal agencies.
Not surprisingly, NIH heavily supports biology, health, and psychology PhDs, while NSF heavily
supports PhDs in engineering, the physical sciences, mathematics, and computer science. Other
agencies, which include USDA, support PhDs in agriculture.
Federal funding also affects who does research. Of the women in our sample, 39% are federally
funded, compared to 52% of men. There are also substantial differences across agencies – a
larger share of doctoral recipients supported by NIH are women (50%), African American (2.6%)
and Hispanic (4.2%), compared to NSF, the Department of Defense (DOD) or the Department of
Energy (DOE).
Finally, federal funding is highly correlated with the pipeline of researchers going into different
fields, particularly R&D fields, and the decision to pursue postdoctoral fellowships.
As with any research, caveats apply. The analysis presented here draws on UMETRICS data
from seven leading research universities. The universities may not be representative of the
research university population at large (indeed, it is difficult to imagine any sample that would
be fully representative), but they mix public and private schools; most, but not all, have medical
schools and engineering schools. All are members of the American Association of Universities,
and hence are among the most research intensive universities. The analysis here focuses only
on federal funding for graduate students in the two years prior to receiving their doctoral
degree; the same analysis could be done on non‐federal sources of funds, as UMETRICS data is
expanding to include that information for partner institutions. Lastly, the challenges of
establishing a causal link between federal funding and career outcomes are well documented
(9). The current paper is purely descriptive and establishes a set of basic facts. We expect
more causal subsequent research, as the new Institute for Research on Innovation and Science
(IRIS) adds more universities and longer time spans to its existing data infrastructure. Even
beyond its important description of the support for doctoral research training, this research
powerfully demonstrates that it is possible to combine two sources of data, with no additional
burden on survey respondents, to provide much richer insights into the patterns of federal
funding and its contribution to supporting the development of an important part of the
research workforce.

2. Data description
The paper combines data from two sources: the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) from 2011
and 2012 and new transaction data from the UMETRICS program.

Survey of Earned Doctorates
The National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) produces a number of
restricted data sets that are essential for research and reporting on U.S. STEM graduates and
the workforce. The Doctoral Records File (DRF) is a particularly important data source in this
regard. This file contains data on all earned doctorates granted by regionally accredited United
States universities, in all fields, from 1920 to the present. The SED, which began in 1957, forms
the backbone of the DRF. The SED is a survey administered to all the doctorate recipients in the
United States. The overall survey response rate exceeds 90%, and since basic information not
provided by the respondent is filled in by the department, the survey is essentially a census of
doctoral recipients. Between 2011 and 2012, 8931 doctoral recipients were reported by the
seven universities in the SED.
The SED collects information on the doctoral recipient’s educational history, demographic
characteristics, and post‐graduation plans. The SED contains, inter alia, the following
information: the doctorate’s name, birth year, country of birth, race, sex, academic institution
of the doctorate, sources of financial support during graduate school and sources and type of
financial support for postdoctoral study or research.
However, there is no question in the SED that provides comprehensive information about
federal research funding. Two questions provide indirect information: One question (A5) asks,
“Please indicate whether each of the following was a source of financial support during
graduate school: fellowship/scholarship; grant; teaching assistantship; research assistantship;
other assistantship; traineeship; internship; loans; personal savings; personal earnings;
spouse’s, partner’s or family’s earnings; employer reimbursement; foreign support.” Another
question (A6) asks, “Which two sources in question A5 provided the most support”. The
answers to these questions are suggestive of the source of support but not definitive (setting
aside reporting issues). For instance, people supported on research assistantships are more
likely to be supported by federal funds, but might be supported by state, local, corporate,
foundation, or institutional funds.

UMETRICS data
The UMETRICS data captures information from payroll records of who is paid from federal
research funds. It builds upon the STAR METRICS project initiated in 2009 by the US Federal
agencies, with the engagement of the Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP).(10) The goal of
the original project was to build an open source, two‐layered, continually evolving data
platform that could be used to (1) provide policymakers with a better understanding of the
process of research and (2) provide the research community with a common data infrastructure
that connected research funding with research outcomes (11).
4

The UMETRICS project, which extends the federal STAR METRICS effort, currently contains
record level information on wage payments made from federal grants to doctoral students and
other university personnel. Currently, 49 universities, accounting for more than 40% of federal
R&D expenditures, are committed to participating, but the project is expected to become a
national program with the recent establishment of the Institute for Research on Innovation and
Science (IRIS) at the University of Michigan. The UMETRICS initiative was incubated by the Big
10 Academic Alliance (B10AA, formerly the Committee on Institutional Cooperation), a
consortium of large, mostly public, research universities mainly in the Midwest. Most of our
data come from B10AA institutions. To maximize the coverage and the number of schools
represented, our primary focus is on students completing doctorates in 2011 or 2012, looking
back to the last two years in their program. It is worth noting that not all individuals working on
research grants are included in the UMETRICS data. The employee transactional data includes
only people/employees who were paid on research grants. Individuals paid as work study
trainees and those on honoraria are not covered. Coverage of non‐federal grants ranges widely
from university to university. Coverage of federal grants is generally complete, with the
exception of one university that did not supply classified DOD research.
Although four files are provided by the university, the key file of interest in this project is the
employee file. Briefly, for each federally funded project, the file contains all payroll charges for
all pay periods (period start date to period end date) with links to both the federal award id
(unique award number) and the internal university id number (recipient account number). Also
available from the payroll records are the employee’s internal de‐identified employee number,
the occupational classification, their FTE status and the proportion of earnings allocated to the
award. (11, 12)
The base sample was selected from the Survey of Earned Doctorates. During the period 2011
and 2012, 8,931 individuals graduated with doctoral degrees from the seven universities. Of
these 8,931 doctoral recipients, 4,930 or 55% were matched to the UMETRICS funding data of
these seven universities2. 4116 were federally funded in the two years before graduating.

2

The match was based on the academic institution, name, year and month of birth, and
conducted under strict confidentiality restrictions. Protecting respondent confidentiality, while
minimizing respondent burden, is imperative if administrative records are to be used to enrich current
NCSES products and expand possibilities for research and reporting for NCSES. In the case of the
Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), the data are restricted use. The license under which the data
were accessed was agreed to by the American Institutes for Research for contract work allowed by
the National Science Foundation in order to improve understanding of the potential value of
administrative records to improve the SED. All data were secured in a dedicated project server that
employs limited access controls by both using strong passwords for user access and by blocking
incoming/outgoing traffic from any other network. Only limited access was allowed, by AIR
researchers under contract to NCSES. Users are permitted access only from a desktop physically
located onsite at AIR. Additional security measures are in place per NSF RUD requirements.

3. Federal funding
Table 1 summarizes the sources of federal funding as reported by the respondents to the
Survey of Earned Doctorates. Almost 90% of the SED respondents from these universities cite
one or more of four sources as their support (response to question A5): research assistantship
(68%), fellowship/scholarship (64%), teaching assistantship (53%), and grant (28%). The links
to UMETRICS now permit administrative information to be added about the source of funding.
It is clear that federal funding is an extremely important source of support for doctoral
recipients in these research intensive universities – almost half (46%) of doctoral recipients
were federally funded in the two years prior to receiving their doctoral degree. Almost 56% of
those who reported being supported on a research assistantship received at least some federal
support. About 44% of those supported on a fellowship or a scholarship, 46% of those on a
teaching assistantship, and 49% of those on a grant, also received some federal support

Responses to SED Question A5: Which of the following were sources of financial support during graduate school?
*814 individuals from the matched SED‐UMETRICS sample were either federally funded after their PhD completion
or in a period earlier than 2 years before their PhD graduation date

Individuals in SED (8,931)
2
Individuals in the UMETRICS‐SED matched sample (4,930)
3
Individuals in the UMETRICS‐SED matched sample who were federally funded* (4,116)

It is also possible to use UMETRICS data to understand the patterns of federal funding for each
individual over a period of time. Federal funding is not just a one‐time source of support, since
the data show that, on average, doctoral recipients were supported for 10 months out of the
two years prior to receiving their degree; the median duration of coverage was 8 months.
6

As Figure 1 shows, there are large variations in the share supported across universities, which
appear to be driven by the amount of research funding as well as the fields in which the schools
are concentrated. The share supported also increases by as much as 15% as the horizon over
which support is calculated increases from 2 years to (up to) 5 or 6 years before graduation
(two of the universities in the data provided data for more than 10 years).

Note. The figure shows the share of people supported by federal funds based on the time
horizon – the number of years prior to graduation ‐ over which support is calculated. Schools
provided data for different periods, so data are available for fewer schools over longer time
horizons. We used data on all people with data at a given time horizon, so the composition of
people at each school varies by time horizon.
The duration of support is substantially lower in agriculture, mathematics, psychology, social
science and non‐Science, Engineering, or Health (SEH) fields, where the average duration of
those funded is just over 8 months. Federal funding is also not monolithic: most students rely
on more than one research grant for funding; the doctoral recipients were supported by 1.7
federal grants on average during the last two years prior to receiving their degree. Consistent
with our intuition, the share of people supported by 2 agencies increases substantially as the
window over which support is calculated increases – from 7% over a 2‐year window to 15% or
higher over a 5‐ or 6‐year horizon. While few people are supported by 3 agencies, the rate
7

increases even more dramatically – from .6% over a 2‐year horizon to 3% over a 5‐ or 6‐year
horizon.
Of course, there are many different sources of federal funding3; because each agency only has
access to its own data, it has hitherto not been possible to capture how agency funding is
interconnected at the individual student level. UMETRICS data do provide that information,
and our analysis uncovers some striking interdependencies. As Table 2 shows, the NIH
provided funding for roughly 40% of the federally funded cohort; NSF supported slightly more.
The DOD supported just over one in ten and DOE roughly one in ten, all depending on the
horizon over which support is calculated.

The major agencies are the NIH, the NSF, the DOD and DOE.

Many students are supported by grants from multiple agencies, but the agency dependence
differs dramatically by agency. For example, of the 506 individuals ever supported by DOD
funding, 226 or almost 45% were supported by funding from another federal agency. Of the
398 individuals ever supported by DOE funding, 160 or 40% were funded from another agency.
These proportions drop dramatically for NIH funding. Of the 1604 individuals ever supported
by NIH funding in the two years prior to graduating, just over 15% were supported by grants
from other agencies. Put another way, 84% of doctoral recipients supported by NIH had NIH as
their sole source of externally‐funded support. Students supported by NSF funding are slightly
less dependent: 30% of those ever supported by NSF funding were also funded from other
sources.
The new data also make it possible to examine the distribution of federal funding by discipline.
This point is illustrated in Figure 2. There are stark differences in the proportion of doctoral
recipients in each discipline who are supported by federal funding. As panel A in Figure 2
shows, well over three in four students in physical sciences, agriculture / biology, and computer
/ mathematical sciences are on federal grants in the two years prior to getting their degree.
That number drops to less than one in five for social sciences and one in ten for humanities.
Panel B shows that there are also large field differences in the probability that people receive
support from multiple federal agencies. Panel C shows how the various agencies support work
by field, with large, but intuitive, differences – NIH overwhelmingly supports PhDs in biology,
health, and psychology; NSF dominates mathematics and computer science. Panel D gives
counts of the numbers of PhD graduates overall and with federal support.

Much concern has been voiced about diversity in the research workforce(13). These linked
data will enable new insights about the connection between federal funding and workforce
composition. As Table 3 demonstrates, in this linked sample, there are many fewer women
than men in the SED cohort ‐‐ 56% are male and 44% female. Only 39% of females are federally
funded, while 52% of males are. Another way of putting this is that of the over 8924 individuals
in the dataset, only 17% are federally funded females; 29% are federally funded males. Of
course, these demographics are different across funding agencies. Of those doctoral recipients
ever supported by NIH, half are female, compared with 29% for NSF, 20% for DOD, and 17% for
DOE.

We performed similar calculations by race, ethnicity, and US born individuals: NIH supports
more African Americans; NIH and DOE support more domestic relative to foreign‐born doctoral
recipients than the other agencies. Table 4 provides a summary. Column 1 shows that without
controlling for discipline, Asians are most likely to be federally funded and females are less
likely to be funded. Columns 2 and 3 show that individuals with degrees in biology, computer
science, and engineering are most likely to be federally funded.

4. Relationship between Federal Funding and Post‐Graduation Plans
An important contribution of this approach is to be able to examine the relationship between
federal funding and the future career pathways of PhD recipients; the SED provides rich
information about the career plans of graduating doctoral recipients. Information is available
on three types of pathways: plans to take a postdoctoral position, plans to work in the private
13

sector, and plans to work in the R&D sector. Only about 70% of the cohort responded to the
question, but of those, 44% reported that they planned to be either a postdoctoral fellow or
research associate, and 71% would be working in R&D (either in industry or academia).
Plans to take a Postdoc Position: Our data indicate that federal funding is strongly correlated
with the likelihood that individuals choose a postdoctoral position – individuals with federal
funding are 5‐22% more likely to take a postdoc position. The intensity of support (the number
of months a person is supported by federal funding) is weakly positively correlated with the
decision to take a postdoc; the magnitude is also quite small (.001‐.003). Of course, much of
the effect is related to the field of study. There is anecdotal evidence that many doctorates in
the life sciences continue to a postdoc, either because additional training is necessary or
because there are not many jobs available for PhDs in the life sciences. Indeed, graduating
with a degree in the life sciences is highly positively correlated with the decision to take a
postdoc. Once field differences are included, the relationship between federal funding and
postdoc plans is weaker. The relationship with gender is not significant, but foreign‐born
individuals are more likely to take postdoc positions, perhaps because it provides a way to stay
in the U.S.

The SED includes two interesting questions about the post‐graduation employer. The first is a
question about the principal employer for which respondents will be working after graduation,
and whether or not the employer is in the private sector. Those respondents who had received
federal funding were just under 3‐6% more likely to work in the private sector than those who
had never received federal funding. The second is a question about whether doctoral
recipients plan to work in the R&D sector. The results here are striking. The relationship with
federal funding is large and significant until field of degree is included. Once field of degree is
included, only NIH funding is correlated with R&D employment plans – not surprisingly, those
with degrees in engineering, computer science, and biology are most likely to work in the R&D
sector4.

The measurement of plans to work in the R&D sector (for those who had definite plans) was
based on the response to Question B10 of the SED survey: “What will be your primary and
secondary work activities? Using question B10a (answer to primary work activity) we generated
the following binary outcome: R&D=1 If B10a=Research and Development; R&D=0 If
B10a=Teaching; Management or Administration; Professional Services to Individuals; Other
and R&D=.if B10a=99 (NO DEFINITE PLANS) or If B10a=. (individual with definite plans did not

5. Summary
This paper has combined a new administrative dataset (UMETRICS) with a major established
survey dataset (SED) to provide new insights into the links between federal funding structure
and the composition of the doctorally trained workforce. The contribution is substantial, since
current surveys do not provide information about the extent or intensity of federal funding, and
no individual agency, looking at its own data, can document how many doctoral recipients are
supported by federal funds. We find large differences in funding patterns across federal funding
agencies in terms of the number and disciplinary training of doctoral students. Federal funding
is also strongly related to individual characteristics and career pathways.
Much more can be done; the analysis draws on data for only seven major research universities
for which long historical data exist. As data from the new Institute for Research on Innovation
and Science expands across more institutions and longer time periods, the analysis can become
more generalized. It can also be extended to examine the links to non‐federal sources of
funds, as UMETRICS data is expanding to include that information for partner institutions. And
with those links, more causal analysis can be added to the descriptive characterization provided
in this paper. In the long run, the opportunity exists to design surveys around the types of data
that cannot be obtained from administrative sources, letting respondents focus on topics that
cannot be obtained from non‐survey methods. Moreover, we are pleased that researchers in
other countries are beginning to develop parallel systems.
