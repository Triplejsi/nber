We perform maximum likelihood estimation of a model of international
asset pricing based on CAI4. We test the restrictions imposed by CAB'l against
a more general asset pricing model. The "betas" in our CA11 vary over time

We let the

covariances change over time as a function of macroeconomic data.
We also
estimate the model when the covariances follow a multivariate ARCH process.
When the covariance of forecast errors are time—varying, we can identify a
modified CAI4 model with measurement error -- which we also estimate. We find
that the model in which the CAE4 restrictions are imposed (which involve
cross—equation constraints between coefficients arid the variances of the
residuals) perform much better when variances are not constant over time.

Cie branch of this literature can be viewed as a refinement on the
portfolio balance models, in that it derives asset demand equations (rather

than asset pricing equations as in most of the literature cited in the
previous paragraph) from an underlying utility maximization approach. Frankel
(1982b) proposed that a popular and reasonable model of asset diversification

the capital asset pricing model (CAF1) -- can be implemented for
international asset data and estimated.
Furthermore, the restrictions that

for a discussion of this literature.)
Typically the conditional variance, 0, has been treated as a constant.
However, several authors, including Hodrick and Srivastava (1984), Ciznby and
Obstfeld (1984), Hsieh (1984) and Diebold and Nerlove (1986) have noted that
forecast errors in foreign exchange markets are notoriously heteroskedastjc.

3

if the money supply or oil prices have been behaving erratically in the recent
past, it is likely that the exchange rate forecast variance will increase.

A method of modelling time-varying variances that does not rely on
macroeconomic data has been suggested by Engle (1982). In essence, he
postulates that the variance this period is likely to be large following a
large error (positive or negative) in the previous period. In a univariate
context, for example, we might see

a + I3e,
where a is the variance this period, and E is the forecast error made at t for

the time t-1 forecast.

This modelling of the variance is labelled

autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) by Engle. ARCH models
have been used in the foreign exchange literature by Dojnowitz and Hakkio
(1985), Hsieh (1985) and Kaminsky and Peruga (1986).

2. CAP1 with Time-Varying Variances

A general model of the real rates of return on N+1 assets might be that
the rates of return are influenced by changes in the value of the outstanding
supply of these assets. Thus, one might expect that for any given asset, its
expected rate of return would rise if the supply of that asset increased. The
expected return on this asset may also be influenced by an increase in the
supplies of other assets.
Choosing one asset as numeraire, the expected rates of return on the
N—vector for the other assets relative to the numeraire might be a function of
the value of the supplies of these assets as a share of the total value of the
N+1 assets. Thus, we could write:

Although the point estimate of p in this model is negative, its standard
error is very large, so that essentially no economically reasonable value of P

there is no evidence of a risk premium.

plausible macroeconomic sources of variation.
Each element of' the covariance matrix 0 could vary independently with the
macroeconomic data (subject to the synmietry constraint on 0). Thus, in our

five equation model, each of the 15 elements of 0 might be a linear function

of some variable or variables x. As a practical matter, this five equation
system with the constraint imposed between coefficients and the variance
matrix is very difficult to estimate. We find it desirable to parameterize
the process parsimoniously, at least in our

version of CAPM, in favor of a model in which the forecast variances are
greater when there are large percentage changes in the money supply.
Given that this model is a significant improvement on the model whose

estimates are reported in Table 1, we now want to test whether the
restrictions imposed by CARl are binding. In Table 5, the coefficients were
constrained to be proportional to the variance matrix 0. The unconstrained
model in this case would let the coefficient matrix B (from equation (2)) vary
over time as a function of the square of the change in the log of the money
supply, and not be constrained to be related in any way to the 0 matrix. At
the bottom of Table 5 is reported the LII statistic for the test of the CAFI
restriction against the alternative that B is symmetric but not constrained to
be proportional to the variance matrix of the residuals. The statistic has
19 degrees of freedom and, as indicated in the table, shows that the CA1
restrictions are strongly rejected. Actually, visual inspection of Table 2 is
enough to cast serious doubt on the CARl hypothesis since the point estimate
of p is negative (but not significantly different from zero).
A note of caution is in order here. Suppose the UI test had failed to
reject the CARl restrictions in Table 5.

How should we interpret such a

failure to reject? We estimate p quite imprecisely, and in fact cannot reject

The hypotheses that the variance in the forecast errors is related to the

size of unanticipated changes in money and oil prices are tested in Tables 4

and 5. We in fact find that the squared ARIMA residuals for oil prices do a
good job of explaining changes in the variance under the CARl restrictions (in

the sense that the likelihood is significantly improved over the constant 0
model), but the ARIMA residuals for money are not as successful. However, in
both cases the point estimate of p is negative, and in both cases the

In this section we have found some evidence that the variance of the
forecast error does change over time. In particular, we find that the square
of the unanticipated monthly growth rate of dollar oil prices and of the
monthly growth rate of U.S. Ml are significant explainers of the variance of
the residuals. Thus, the constant 0 version of CARl can be rejected.
However, these models offer little consolation for the more general CAW

change in the risk premium is the product of the change in the asset supply
and the variance of exchange rate forecasts (times p). Furthermore, he argues
that the conditional variance will be smaller than the unconditional variance,
so that even if the variance were allowed to vary over time the CARl model
still could not explain much of the exchange risk premium. Pagan (1986) has
pointed out that, in fact, the conditional variance need not be smaller than
the unconditional variance. The graphs in Figure 1 confirm that for some
periods the conditional variances are much larger than the unconditional
variance. However, on average they must be smaller, as Frankel (1987)
indicates.
If the variance does vary over time, the variability of the variances
themselves might explain the observed size of risk premia within the framework

of CARI. This point is brought out in the exchange between Giovannini and
Jorion (1987a, 198Th) and Frankel (1987). The results from our ARCH
estimation and CARl tests, though, make this speculation moot. Our estimation
does allow the variance to change, but CARl is still strongly rejected.
Because the five parameter ARCH model of CARl

on the CARl model constrained to have a constant variance, we proceed to test
a less sparsely parameterized ARCH model. Table 8 reports the results of the

a model in which it is assumed

that

Then when we replace the expectation of z1 with its realization, the

disturbance term in the estimating equation will be the sum of the forecast
error and the preference shocks. In this case, the explanatory variables —-

the asset shares —— would be correlated with the error, since we would expect

as risk preferences change the values of the outstanding stocks of the
assets would also change. Thus, the estimation techniques undertaken here
would be rendered invalid. It should be understood, then, as Frankel and
Engel discuss, that the CARl tests discussed previously in this paper are

There is another problem that the addition of demand errors cause that
is special to this problem and would not necessarily appear in some other test
of "orthogonality conditions". It is also present if there is measurement
error in either the dependent or explanatory variables. When some source of

error other than the forecast error is present in the residual, it is no
longer the case that under CA11 the coefficients on the asset shares should be

proportional to the variance of the residual.

They should only be

proportional to the variance of the forecast error.
Although we offer no general solution to the problems of
misspecification, we can generalize the tests in one direction when forecast
errors have a time-varying variance.

We can identify and estimate equation

This

identification is possible when the variance of the forecast errors is a

the value of the likelihood, since the forecast error variance is the only
part of the total error variance that changes with time.
We only consider models of the forecast error variance in which the
variance depends on macroeconomic data, as in equation (4). While we are able

to separate out the variance of the forecast errors from the variance of the
measurement error, we cannot distinguish between the forecast error and the
measurement error themselves.

The ARCH model, however, requires that the

forecast errors be identifiable, if we hypothesize that the variance of the
forecast error depends on the lagged moment matrix of realized forecast
errors. So, we must abandon ARCH as our model of the time—varying variance of
forecast errors, and instead rely on equation (4).
The models of section 2 are restricted forms of equation (7). They force

the matrix E to be zero. As in the previous sections, we choose a form for
the variance that ensures it is positive semi-definite. Equation (4) defines

Unfortunately, the restrictions that CAR1 places on those more general asset
demand equations -- restrictions that imply that the returns on assets are
functions not only of the supplies of assets, but also of the variances and
covar lances of the asset returns —— have universally been rejected in previous
literature. Although this paper allows for substantial generalization of the
CARl model, its restrictions are still not accepted.

might think of several reasons why previous papers have rejected CARl
-- but some of the most important problems with past models are taken care of
here. One of the most obvious problems, as pointed out by Giovannini and
One

Jorion (1987a) among others, is that in practice those who have implemented
the Frankel test have assumed the forecast error variances and covariances to
be constant over time. Given the abundant evidence of heteroskedasticity in

these errors, this seemed like a natural point of misspecification in the
empirical CARl models.

conditionally

However, we test several versions of CARl with

heteroskedastic errors but

still find little support for the

model.

It is sometimes argued that a deficiency in the Frankel approach is that
the only way it can provide a measure of the variance of expectatiorial errors
is by extrapolating from past expectational errors. It is argued that if

there is a policy change or some other economic shock that increases
uncertainty, that there is no way to pick this up reliably from the data.
This argument carries much less weight when we allow the variance of the
forecast error to be a function of economic variables whose changes are apt to
be important generators of uncertainty —— such as money growth or oil prices.
(Xr models of sections 2 and 3 allow for just such a possibility, yet again
CARl gets no support.

Another potential problem with the Frankel set-up is that it requires the
CAR equation to hold exactly. We have relaxed this constraint in section 4
20

by allowing for sri error that is uncorrelated with the forecast error and the
right-hand-side

variables. However, this model is no improvement empirically.
This paper extends the frontiers of estimation of international CAPM to
consider some of the most important possibilities that have been suggested for
the empirical failure of that model, yet the model still does not get a shred
of support.

Appendix 1

Lagrange Multiplier

Test

In several places in this paper, we have presented maximum likelihood

estimates of a model and wish to compare the model to a less restricted
model.

In every case the estimates reported could have been obtained by

estimating the less restricted model subject to some restrictions. (These are

zero restrictions exclusively in this paper.) We obtained our estimates by
maximizing the restricted likelihood:

0R solves max
0

(A)

where

is the vector of restricted maximum likelihood estimates and ZR(O) is

the log likelihood function for the restricted model.

A mathematically

equivalent way to obtain the reported estimates would be by obtaining:

solves max Z(O) subject to° H h(O)O
0

(B)

where Z represents the unrestricted log likelihood function and h(0) is the
vector valued function of constraints.

For convenience, the solutions to

problems (A) and (B) are represented by the same vector although the solution
to (B) has higher dimension than the solution to (A).

Data Appendix

Our analysis relies on rate of return and aggregate asset data for the
six countries in the study:
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom,
and United States. The assets studied are publicly held outstanding
government debt denominated in the six currencies: francs, yen, lire, marks,
pouncLs, and dollars. The calculation method,

denominated assets for domestic denominated assets in the hands of the
public.) Subtracted from this total is the value of assets held in that
currency by central banks (a figure which is obtainable through numbers
central

available in the IMF Annual Report). Because no correction is made for debt
held by the central bank of its own government, these figures for the values
of the outstanding assets are the values of debt and monetary base held by the
public for each country.
The analysis in the paper utilizes asset shares rather than the level of

assets. The asset shares were computed from the asset levels, measured in
dollars. The asset share data covered the period from June 1973 to December
1984.

The nominal rate of return for dollar assets was taken as the average of
the bid and ask Eurodollar rates (DRIFACS series USDO1B and USDO1A) on
one—month securities, measured on the last day of the month that was not a
holiday.
