ABSTRACT
Despite great focus on and public investment in STEM education, little causal evidence connects
quantitative coursework to students’ economic outcomes. I show that state changes in minimum
high school math requirements substantially increase Black students’ completed math coursework
and their later earnings. The marginal student’s return to an additional math course is 10 percent,
roughly half the return to a year of high school, and is partly explained by a shift toward more
cognitively skilled occupations. White students’ coursework and earnings are unaffected.
Rigorous standards for quantitative coursework can close meaningful portions of racial gaps in
economic outcomes.

Introduction

National efforts to improve the mathematical and scientific skills of Americans date back to at least
the 1958 National Defense Education Act, which used federal funds to spur curricular changes
intended to help the U.S. compete with the perceived superiority of the Soviet Union’s scientific
capabilities. Though STEM education has been a national imperative for at least six decades,
recent efforts have been particularly focused on the need for individuals to be well-educated in
math and science in order to succeed in a rapidly changing job market. A large literature has
documented substantial and increasing economic returns to skill that may stem from skill-biased
technological change (Katz and Murphy, 1992; Acemoglu and Autor, 2011). Cognitive skills and
mathematical skills in particular have shown high returns, although very recent evidence suggests
a slowdown in demand for such skills perhaps because of the rapid substitution of computers for
many routine tasks (Autor et al., 2003; Deming, 2017; Beaudry et al., 2016; Castex and Dechter,
2014; Autor and Dorn, 2013).
Racial gaps in mathematical skills are strikingly high. Over the last few decades, Black 17 yearolds have generally scored about one standard deviation below their White counterparts on the
National Assessment of Education Progress. Conditional on being employed, Blacks are less likely
than Whites to report that their jobs require the use of high school level math on at least a weekly
basis (Autor and Handel, 2013). The labor market return to and racial gaps in cognitive skills are
both sufficiently high that they together account for large proportions of racial gaps in economic
outcomes (Neal and Johnson, 1996; Fryer, 2011). We nonetheless have relatively little evidence
about whether typical STEM education interventions can change students’ skills and economic
outcomes.
I provide clear evidence that math coursework can impact earnings in economically meaningful ways. To do so, I construct an original, nationally representative time series of high school
transcripts containing detailed information on students’ completed coursework. I then exploit as a
source of exogenous variation in math coursework the differential timing of state increases in high
school graduation requirements triggered by the 1983 report “A Nation at Risk”. A difference-indifference framework with state and cohort fixed effects shows these reforms increased the num1

ber of yearlong math courses Black high school graduates completed by 0.35, consisting primarily
of basic courses like pre-algebra and algebra. Black students in public schools and heavily minority schools saw the biggest increases, consistent with changed minimum requirements most
affecting those with low ex ante levels of math achievement. White students’ coursework was
substantially less affected by these reforms.
Applying the same difference-in-difference strategy to Census data shows that these math
reforms increased the adult earnings of Black high school graduates by between three and four
percent. This implies the Mincerian return to an additional yearlong math course for the marginal
student was about 10 percent, or half the apparent return to a year of high school for such students.
Earnings did not increase for White students, whose math coursework was largely unchanged, or
for Black high school dropouts, whose coursework was also likely unaffected by new graduation
requirements. Reforms did not affect educational attainment, but Blacks’ increased earnings are
partly explained by a shift toward occupations with higher cognitive skill requirements. Earnings
increases are associated with increased coursework only in math and not in other subjects.
These results have three major implications. First, state-level minimum requirements can
meaningfully change students’ educational experiences, particularly for those students with low
ex ante achievement. Second, coursework, particularly in math, can explain a large fraction of
the return to a year of schooling. Third, closing racial gaps in math coursework can contribute
substantially to the closing of racial gaps in earnings and other economic outcomes. The reforms
studied here closed the majority of the Black-White gap in the number of overall math courses
completed and reduced by one-tenth or more the Black-White gaps in annual earnings and occupational cognitive skill. Given that these reforms largely increased coursework in basic math,
interventions successful at closing racial gaps in more advanced math coursework might further
reduce gaps in economic outcomes.
This research illuminates one channel through which returns to schooling may operate. Economists
have been quantifying the association between years of schooling and earnings for at least fifty
years, starting with simple multivariate regression models with few controls (Becker and Chiswick,
1966; Mincer, 1974) and continuing with more complex approaches that generally confirm sub-

2

stantial returns to schooling (Card, 2001; Heckman et al., 2006). The use of compulsory schooling
law changes as exogenous variation in educational attainment produces results largely consistent with earlier non-experimental literature (Acemoglu and Angrist, 2001; Oreopoulos, 2006),
although these results may be sensitive to empirical specification (Stephens and Yang, 2014; Devereux and Hart, 2010). More recent research estimates large returns to college education through
regression discontinuity designs around admissions thresholds (Hoekstra, 2009; Zimmerman, 2014).
Most of this work estimates returns to the total amount of time spent in school rather than the allocation of existing school time.
The reforms studied here provide evidence that changes in the amount of time spent in specific courses, namely math courses, can be a significant determinant of the labor market return
to a year of schooling. Though identifying returns to specific courses and curricula is generally
difficult because of endogenous selection, quantitative high school coursework and college majors are consistently associated with higher earnings (Altonji et al., 2012). Recent work exploiting
degree program admissions thresholds in international contexts shows that quantitative college
majors have a positive impact on earnings (Hastings et al., 2013; Kirkeboen et al., 2016). The only
evidence on returns to individual college courses comes from the literature on remediation, which
has little discernible impact on earnings perhaps because it diverts students from college-level
courses into more basic courses (Martorell and McFarlin Jr, 2011; Scott-Clayton and Rodriguez,
2015).
Similarly little evidence exists on returns to high school coursework, with early attempts to
identify returns to math coursework based on identification strategies likely only partial successful at dealing with selection bias (Altonji, 1995; Levine and Zimmerman, 1995; Rose and Betts,
2004). More recent work has exploited test-scored based eligibility thresholds to show that doubling instructional time in basic math courses improves both short-run achievement and mediumrun educational attainment for struggling students (Taylor, 2014; Cortes et al., 2015). Only two
other papers use quasi-experimental variation in high school coursework to identify earnings impacts, both focusing on advanced courses that affect college trajectories. Jackson (2014) finds that
targeted cash incentives to students and teachers in low-income urban schools increases Advanced

3

Placement course-taking and performance, college persistence, and wages. Joensen and Nielsen
(2009) use a Danish high school reform to estimate a roughly 30 percent earnings increase from an
advanced math curriculum, partly due to increased college attainment. This work complements
those papers by showing earnings returns to lower level math coursework even in the absence of
significant increases in college attainment.

Reforms to Required Math Coursework

The increased graduation requirements that serve here as the exogenous source of variation in student coursework were prompted largely by the publication in April 1983 of “A Nation at Risk,”
the final report of the National Commission on Excellence in Education (Gardner et al. 1983). The
commission had been convened to address perceived declines in the quality of education experienced by American high school students. The first two sentences of the report read: “Our Nation
is at risk. Our once unchallenged preeminence in commerce, industry, science, and technological innovation is being overtaken by competitors throughout the world.” The report continued
by mentioning Japan, South Korea and Germany as countries making technological advances in
industries where America had historically been dominant, concluding that “Learning is the indispensable investment required for success in the ’information age’ we are entering.”
The commission identified as one of the primary causes of perceived educational decline the
fact that “Secondary school curricula have been homogenized, diluted, and diffused to the point
that they no longer have a central purpose.” Noting that American high school students earned
25 percent of their credits in “physical and health education, work experience outside the school,
remedial English and mathematics, and personal service and development courses,” the commission proposed that state and local graduation requirements be strengthened dramatically. Specifically, the commission recommended that “all students seeking a diploma be required to lay the
foundations in the Five New Basics by taking the following curriculum during their 4 years of
high school: (a) 4 years of English; (b) 3 years of mathematics; (c) 3 years of science; (d) 3 years of
social studies; and (e) one-half year of computer science.”
The vast majority of states reacted to the commission’s recommendations by increasing the
4

minimum number of courses in various subjects required for students to receive a high school
diploma, though not necessarily to the levels that the commission had recommended. I collected
documents on historical high school graduation requirements from the Education Commission of
the States, much though not all of which information is also available through various versions
of the US Department of Education’s “Digest of Education Statistics.” I constructed for each state
and for each graduating cohort of 1982 through 1994 the minimum number of math, science,
social studies, English and other courses a student would need to complete in order to receive a
high school diploma, where “course” refers to a full year of study.
Though many states enacted increases in multiple types of coursework simultaneously, I focus largely on increased requirements in math, the subject most commonly addressed by these
reforms. Figure 1 shows the timing of math reforms. Only six states enacted reforms applying to
cohorts graduating high school prior to 1987. The bulk of the reforms are roughly evenly split between cohorts graduating in 1987, 1988, and 1989, with only one state enacting reforms after that
period. This timing stems from state policymakers responding relatively quickly to “A Nation at
Risk” by legislating increased graduation requirements in year Y (generally 1983, 1984, or 1985)
to apply to students entering high school that year and thus graduating in year Y+4. Compared
to the graduating cohort of 1982, the 1994 cohort faced higher minimum math requirements in 40
states, including Washington, DC. In contrast, science requirements increased in 32 states, social
studies requirements in 23 states and English requirements in 18 states.1
Figure 2 shows the geography of pre- and post-reform math requirements. In 1982, the vast
majority of states allowed students to graduate high school with zero or one completed math
courses, while only a handful of states required a two course minimum and none required three.
By 1994, the vast majority of states required at least two math courses, and a number required
three. Specifically, 31 of the reforming states increased their graduation requirements to two math
courses, from either one (24 states) or zero (seven states). Only nine states increase their requirements to three math courses.2 The vast majority of states that enacted reforms thus set their new

See Table A.1, which categorizes states by their pre- and post-reform numbers of math courses required for graduation.

minima lower than the commission’s recommendation of three required math courses.
Variation in the timing of reforms is not closely related to geography. Figure 3 maps the timing of math reforms, with darker shades representing later reforms. Nearly every region of the
country contains both early- and late-reforming states and nearly every state borders another that
reformed its math requirements in a different year. Variation in the timing of math reforms, coupled with the fact that such variation is not spatially concentrated, will help identify the causal
impact of such reforms on coursework and labor market outcomes.

Data and Summary Statistics

No single data set exists that would allow linkage of math reform timing to information on high
school coursework and labor market outcomes for students in high school around the years of
these reforms. The few longitudinal studies that follow students from high school to the labor
market (National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, High School and Beyond, National Education
Longitudinal Study) cover too few graduating cohorts to be useful, while most traditional data sets
used by labor economists (Census, Current Population Survey, Panel Survey of Income Dynamics)
contain little or no information on high school coursework. I therefore use two separate data sets,
a time series of high school transcript studies that I construct and Census data containing labor
market outcomes. The transcript data allow estimation of a first stage impact of the reforms on
coursework, while the Census data allow estimation of the reduced form impact of the reforms on
earnings. The ratio of these two estimates can be thought of as the instrumental variables estimate
of the impact of math coursework on earnings, for the marginal student whose coursework is
affected by such reforms.

3.1

The Transcript Data

The primary challenge in estimating how these reforms affected students’ coursework is that no
data set contains detailed information on students’ coursework by high school cohort and state.
The federal government does, however, collect a national sample of high school transcripts every

6

few years through the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). One of the earliest such
collections occurred for the cohort graduating high school in 1982, in the High School and Beyond
Survey (HSB). Three more waves followed for the graduating cohorts of 1987, 1990 and 1994,
in transcript studies associated with the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).
For each of these waves, NCES collects from high schools around the country a set of student
transcripts listing completed coursework, as well as each high school’s handbook of course descriptions. The latter allows NCES to uniformly code courses that might have different names in
different high schools, according to a scheme known as the Secondary School Taxonomy.
I compile these four transcript collections into a single data set of students for whom I can
identify both state of high school attendance and year of graduation.3 The resulting data set contains the 1982 wave as a purely pre-reform sample, the 1990 and 1994 waves as purely post-reform
samples, and the 1987 wave as a mixture of states that had and had not yet enacted reforms. Because the 1990 and 1994 waves include only high school graduates, I exclude dropouts from the
earlier waves in order to make the samples comparable over time. My primary analysis focuses
on Black and White students because other subgroups, such as Hispanic and Asian students, are
concentrated in a small number of states and are disproportionately born outside of the United
States, making later matching to Census respondents difficult.
For each student, the transcript data allow measurement of the number of courses for which
the student received credit in various subject areas.4 I categorize math courses as “basic”, which
includes vocational math, pre-algebra, algebra and geometry courses, or “advanced”, which includes anything beyond geometry, such as algebra II, pre-calculus, calculus and statistics. I also
compute the total number of completed courses in subjects outside of math. Apart from race and
gender, no demographic information is collected consistently across the four waves of transcript
data. I use as one proxy for family and community characteristics the proportion of each school’s
transcripts collected from Black or Hispanic students. I also observe whether a student’s high
school is public or private.
3
To my knowledge, this is the first such use of this data, perhaps because accessing the state identifiers requires
obtaining a restricted-use license from NCES and because the 1982 wave requires complex crosswalks to infer state
identifiers.
4
NCES provides a standardized unit of credit, called a Carnegie unit, that represents a standard full-year course.

7

For reasons described below in more detail, I exclude from the main analysis sample students
who attended high school in the 11 states that did not enact math reforms. The final transcript
data set consists of about 9,000 Black students and 41,000 White students who graduated high
school in 1982, 1987, 1990 and 1994, from states that enacted math reforms at some point during
this time period.

3.2

Census Data

Because the NAEP waves of the transcript data do not follow students beyond high school, I turn
to the 5% Public Use Microdata Sample of the 2000 Census, a 1-in-20 national random sample of
the US population.5 . The main outcomes of interest in the Census are respondents’ educational
attainment, occupation and total personal earned income in the past calendar year (1999). Educational attainment is reported as a categorical variable, from which I generate indicators for having
completed high school, some college, a two-year college degree and a four-year college degree.
I also generate a continuous measure of years of education by imputing 10 years to high school
dropouts, 12 to high school graduates, 13 to those with some college, 14 to those with two-year
degrees and 16 to those with four-year degrees.
The Census classifies occupations into nearly 500 categories according to the Standard Occupational Classification scheme. I merge these occupations with a measure of the cognitive and
mathematical skills required for each occupation, which I derive from the federal government’s
Occupational Network Database (O-Net). O-Net contains for each occupation measures of the
importance of various cognitive abilities such as number facility, deductive reasoning and oral
comprehension. Each ability is measured on a scale of one to five. Given the high correlation
between these measures within occupations, I average across all abilities for each occupation and
standardize the result across the entire population of respondents to have mean zero and standard
deviation one. I refer to this as each occupation’s cognitive skill. I similarly construct a measure
of each occupation’s mathematical skill by limiting this calculation to sub-measures that mention
math or numbers explicitly.
5

I access the data through http://usa.ipums.org/usa/ (Ruggles et al. 2015)

8

For an earnings measure, I focus on total personal earned income, which includes both wages
and earnings from a respondent’s business or farm. Limiting the analysis to total wages yields
very similar results. I recode the few individuals with negative earnings as having zero earnings.
I explore the impact of the math reforms on both mean earnings, which includes all respondents,
and the natural logarithm of earnings, which includes only those with non-zero earnings. I also
explore the impact of math reforms on the distribution of earnings.
Unlike the transcript data, the Census data records neither respondents’ year of high school
graduation nor the states in which they attended high school. I assign respondents to high school
cohorts assuming they would have graduated the year they turned 18, the median and modal high
school graduation age for Americans. I assume respondents attended high school in their states
of birth, rather than their current state of residence, to avoid bias from potentially endogenous
migration. Though an imperfect measure of state of high school, state of birth is clearly exogenous
to such reforms.6 PUMS data from the 1990 Census shows that 84% of Black 15 year-olds and
78% of White 15 year-olds still live in their state of birth, implying potential measurement error
generated by using state of birth is likely small. This measurement error implies I may be slightly
underestimating the impacts of these reforms on earnings.
Assigning respondents their state of birth as a proxy for state of high school means that foreignborn Census respondents cannot be included in the analysis sample. This excludes a high fraction
of Hispanic and Asian respondents, making it unlikely that the Census sample is comparable to
the transcript sample, given that the latter includes but cannot separately identify students who
are foreign-born but graduate from American high schools. I thus focus my analysis on Black
and White respondents for whom the two samples are comparable, showing results for Hispanic
respondents, the only other subgroup of substantial size, in supplementary analyses.
I take two other steps to make the Census sample more comparable to the transcript sample.
First, I limit the Census sample to those students who turned 18 between 1975 and 1994. Though
the transcript sample’s high school cohorts begin in 1982 and end in 1994, the Census data allows
me to construct a longer pre-period in which to study potential differential trends among states. I
6

All respondents in the final Census sample were born prior to the “Nation at Risk” report’s publication.

9

show in later robustness checks that the longer pre-period improves the precision of the reforms’
estimated earnings impacts but does not affect their magnitude. Second, I limit the Census sample
to high school graduates, given that the transcript sample includes only such students. I show that
math reforms do not affect high school completion rates so that this choice does not generate selection bias, and for completeness also present estimated impacts of these reforms on the earnings
of high school dropouts.
As with the transcript sample, I exclude from the Census sample students who attended high
school in states that did not enact math reforms. The final transcript data set consists of about
280,000 Black adults and 1.8 million White adults who likely graduated from high school between
1975 and 1994 from states that enacted math reforms at some point during this time period.
I also use data from the 2001 through 2015 American Community Surveys (ACS) , which are
administered annually to a random sample of Americans and are designed to mimic the decennial
census except for a smaller sample size. The ACS data provides two pieces of information. First, it
allows me to see whether the earnings impacts observed in the 2000 Census appear in later years.
Second, unlike the Census, the 2008 and later waves of the ACS ask high school graduates whether
they received a traditional high school diploma or instead earned a General Equivalency Diploma
(GED), an alternative credential earned through a set of standardized exams. This allows me to
study whether increased stringency of high school graduation requirements diverted students
toward an alternative pathway not subject to such requirements.

3.3

Summary Statistics

Summary statistics for the transcript and Census samples are shown respectively in panels A
and B of Table 1. The means shown are weighted by sampling weights standardized so that each
cohort receives equal weight. The top two rows of each panel show the minimum number of math
courses required for high school graduation by a given individual’s state in 1982 and 1994. For
both Blacks and Whites, the number of required math courses more than doubled over this time
period from roughly one to 2.3. That the means of these variables are nearly identical across the
transcript and Census samples suggests the two samples have a similar geographic distribution

10

of respondents.
During this time period, both Black and White students completed an average of three math
courses by the end of high school. The composition of this coursework differed greatly by race,
with a higher fraction of Black students’ coursework coming from basic math courses. Though
not shown here, Black students completed an average of 1.2 very basic courses like consumer
math, vocational math and pre-algebra, nearly double the 0.7 such courses completed by White
students. Black students also completely substantially fewer advanced courses (0.6) than White
students (0.9). Black high school graduates during this time period were completing a similar
quantity of math coursework to White high school graduates but in substantially less advanced
topics. Both Black and White students completed about 20 additional courses in subjects outside
of math.
The Census data shows that Black respondents have much lower educational attainment than
Whites, even conditional on being high school graduates. Only 18 percent of Black high school
graduates in this sample have completed a four-year college degree, about half the rate at which
Whites earn such degrees. Annual earnings for Black high school graduates in 1999 average
$22,400, compared to $31,400 for Whites. Conditional on reporting an occupation, Black high
school graduates work in occupations whose required cognitive skill is 0.1 standard deviation below the mean, or nearly 0.4 standard deviations less than the occupations of White high school
graduates. The gap in occupational math skill is similar.
Among those who graduated high school in the 1980s and surrounding years, Blacks lagged
behind Whites in both the amount of advanced math coursework completed and longer-run outcomes such as educational attainment, earnings and the cognitive and mathematical skill required
by their occupations. The remainder of the paper attempts to estimate whether these gaps in math
coursework and labor market outcomes are simply correlations driven by other underlying factors
or whether math coursework itself can have a causal impact on labor market outcomes.

4.1

State Reforms and Math Coursework
Empirical Strategy

I use as a source of exogenous variation in completed math coursework the differential timing
across states of the reforms induced by “A Nation at Risk”. Though most states’ reforms were one
course increases, some states enacted apparently stronger reforms by moving from no statewide
minima to two- and three-course minima. I exploit only the differential timing of the reforms
and not their differing magnitudes for two reasons. First, the transcript data show that states
with no initial requirements, such as California, had very few students graduating with no completed math coursework. This is likely due to local school districts setting minima higher than
state requirements. Whether California’s increase from zero to two courses is a stronger reform
than Virginia’s increase from one to two courses is thus unclear. Second, some states issue multiple types of high school diplomas that distinguish students by the difficulty of their completed
coursework. Although I categorize states by the lowest requirements that allow graduation from
high school, reforms to higher types of diplomas sometimes occurred simultaneously, clouding
the issue of precisely how strong each state’s reform was. The timing of the reforms is much less
ambiguous.
In order to identify the impacts of math reforms solely off of the timing of such changes, I exclude students who attended high school in the 11 states that did not enact math reforms. Those
states are heavily clustered geographically, as seen in Figure 3, and many have constitutions that
specifically prohibit the state, rather than local school districts, from imposing high school coursework requirements. These two factors increase the likelihood that including these states could
introduce bias in my estimates through endogeneity of the decision to adopt math reforms at all.
Identifying causal estimates by using only the 40 math reforming states (including Washington,
DC) requires only the assumption that the timing of reforms is uncorrelated with the timing of
other state-level factors that affect labor market outcomes. Robustness checks below confirm the
plausibility of this assumption by showing that my central estimates are unchanged by controlling for contemporaneous reforms to other aspects of education policy and for changing state

12

economic conditions. Inclusion of state-specific time trends rules out the possibility that reform
timing is related to trends in important outcomes during the pre-reform period.
Given the four available waves of transcript data, this means comparing changes in coursework between states whose increased requirements first applied to the cohorts of 1987 or earlier
(“early-reforming”) and states whose increased requirements first applied to the cohorts of 1988
through 1990 (“late-reforming”). Figure 4 shows the average number of completed math courses
by state reform wave and high school cohort. As shown in panel A, Black high school graduates
in the 1982 cohort completed very similar amounts of math coursework in both early- and latereforming states, just under 2.6 courses. For the 1987 cohort, that number increased substantially
in early-reforming states but much less so in late-reforming states. By the 1990 cohort, Black high
school graduates in late-reforming states had caught up to their counterparts in early-reforming
states, with no further increases apparent once the reform period had ended.
For Black students, the timing of the math reforms is closely connected to changes in completed
math coursework, with increases in such coursework appearing only once a given graduating
cohort in a given state is treated by the new requirements. Panel B shows that White students’
math coursework is much less clearly connected to reform timing. White high school graduates
in the 1982 cohort completed somewhat different amounts of math coursework in early- and latereforming states. Changes in those amounts do coincide with reform timing, with slopes between
cohorts steeper at the expected times, but not nearly as clearly as for Black students. Increases in
math coursework grow in all states throughout this time period and even after the reform period
is over. State reforms thus seem substantially more influential for the math coursework of Black
students than the math coursework of White students.
To more rigorously quantify the impacts of state reforms on math coursework, I run simple,
baseline regression specifications of the form

M athCoursesisc = α1 M athRef ormsc + γF emaleisc + µc + νs + isc

(1)

where M athCourses represents various measures of math coursework completed by student i
in state s and high school cohort c and M athRef orm indicates whether that student was subject
13

to an increased math requirement. State and cohort fixed effects (µc and νs ) are included so that
the coursework impact α1 is identified from the differential timing of within-state changes in math
reform status. State fixed effects eliminate bias from the possibility that reform timing is connected
to state-level factors that themselves affect math coursework. Cohort fixed effects eliminate bias
from the possibility that reform timing is connected to nationwide shocks at a given point in time,
such as national economic fluctuations or educational trends.
Race and gender are the only two individual characteristics I consistently observe over the
multiple waves of transcript data and in the Census data. I run most regressions separately by
race, given both clearly documented racial gaps in educational outcomes and the lack of other
proxies for childhood socioeconomic disadvantage. I include a gender indicator in all regressions.
When pooling regressions by race, I include a full set of interactions between gender and race.
Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors are clustered by state to allow for within-state serial
correlation in the error term , a concern raised by the now well-known result of Bertrand et al.
(2004). Regressions are weighted by sampling weights standardized so that each cohort receives
equal weight to account for different sample sizes across the four transcript studies.7
To separate the impact of math reforms from reforms to other subjects, I also present variations
on the first stage equation 1 of the form:

M athCoursesisc = α1 M athRef ormsc + α2 N onM athRef ormssc + γF emaleisc + µc + νs + isc (2)

Here, N onM athRef orms represents the total number of other subjects whose minimum graduation requirements were increased for students in a given state and high school cohort. These other
subjects include science, social studies, English and “non-core” classes, which include increase requirements outside of the four core academic subjects. The variable N onM athRef orms therefore
takes values from zero (for states that only enacted math reforms) to four (for state that reformed
every subject).
7

Using these weights improves precision but has little effect on point estimates.

Empirical Results

Estimates from equations 1 and 2, shown in Table 2, confirm the visual evidence from Figure
4. Black high school graduates subject to state reforms completed 0.35 more high school math
courses than they otherwise would have. This represents a 14 percent increase relative to the
2.54 courses the 1982 cohort completed and suggests the reforms explain half of the increase over
this time period in Black students’ math coursework. That estimated impact is highly statistically
significant, with an F-statistic of 28, suggesting the reforms provide a strong source of variation in
math coursework for Black students. The impact of reforms on White students was substantially
weaker, raising the number of completed courses by a statistically insignificant 0.14.
Nearly all of the increased math coursework triggered by the reforms for Black students was
concentrated in basic math courses such as pre-algebra, algebra and geometry. For Black students,
reforms increased the number of basic math courses completed by a highly statistically significant 0.28, the majority of which came from additional pre-algebra courses. These reforms explain
roughly all of the increase over this time period in Black students’ basic math coursework but very
little of the rise in advanced math courses, which increase by a small and statistically insignificant
0.07. For White students, the rise in completed math coursework was similarly concentrated in
basic courses, which increased by 0.11, while the number of completed advanced math courses
was nearly unchanged.
The estimated impacts of math reforms on math coursework are robust to controlling for the
number of non-math reforms occurring simultaneously. Reassuringly, the non-math reforms do
not predict increases in math coursework. As panel D of Table 2 shows, only non-math reforms
predict increases in non-math coursework. Controlling for both sets of reforms simultaneously
thus allows me to isolate the long-run impacts of math coursework from the impacts of non-math
coursework.
For Black and White students, the estimated math coursework impacts generated by the baseline specification (Equation 1) are robust to a variety of alternative choices, as shown in Table
A.2. Other educational reforms and economic conditions do not appear to explain the increases
in math coursework, given the stability of estimates to inclusion of controls for the number of re15

forms in non-math subjects, an exit exam indicator, and the state unemployment rate in the year of
high school graduation. Inclusion of state-specific linear time trends also leaves estimates largely
unchanged, as does adding observations from the 11 states that did not enact math reforms during this time period. Excluding from the sample the five most populous states for Blacks and
Whites only slightly diminishes the point estimates, suggesting that impacts are widespread and
not driven by a small number of large states.
In contrast, what initially appears to be a large impact of reforms on Hispanic students’ math
coursework turns out to be driven by the five states where over 80 percent of such students are
concentrated. Using only the remaining 35 states suggests little impact on Hispanic students’
coursework but small sample size makes such point estimates very imprecise. As such, it is unclear what effect, if any, these reforms had on Hispanic students’ math coursework.
To supplement these mean impacts, Table 3 explores the impact of reforms on the distribution
of the number of math courses completed. In 1982, 35 percent of Black students and 27 percent of
White students were graduating having completed fewer math courses than the new state minimums would later require for the lowest type of high school diploma. By 1994, nearly no students
appear to graduate with such few math courses. The math reforms themselves appear to be responsible for about 10 percentage points of that decrease, for both Black and White students.
The reforms did not simply induce students to graduate with the new minimum number of
math courses. For Black students, the reforms increased by 17 percentage points the proportion
graduating with more completed math courses than the state required. White students’ rate of exceeding state minima rose by six percentage points. This may be driven by the some states making
simultaneous reforms to requirements for higher types of diplomas. It may also indicate that state
reforms triggered local school districts to increase their own requirements further, perhaps to distinguish themselves from the state minimum. As panel B shows, the effects of all of these reforms
was to increase by 11 percentage points the fraction of Black students graduating with a full four
years of math coursework. This explains two-thirds of the increase in that fraction over this time
period.
The reforms’ effects on math coursework appear at most slightly stronger for Black males

16

than females, as shown in Table A.3. Completed math coursework among Black students in the
1982 cohort did not differ by gender. The reforms induced Black males and females to complete
respectively 0.41 and 0.31 more math courses than they would have otherwise. Relative to Black
females, a somewhat higher proportion of Black males’ increased coursework came from basic
math courses. Neither difference by gender is, however, statistically distinguishable from zero.
Point estimates for impacts on White students by gender are even closer in magnitude and are
also statistically indistinguishable.
The transcript data allow me to explore two forms of heterogeneity by school type, which I do
in Table 4 by interacting the reform indicator in the baseline specification with school types and
controlling directly for school type. First, reform impacts are driven entirely by public schools and
are statistically indistinguishable from zero in private schools, perhaps because state reforms did
not legally apply to non-public schools. Second, for Black students, reform impacts were larger in
“non-White” schools, those with a higher concentration of Black and Hispanic students than the
median school that year. Both of these forms of heterogeneity by school type may stem from preexisting differences across schools in levels of completed math coursework. Among Black students
in the 1982 cohort, those who attended private schools and White schools were already completing
substantially more math coursework than their public school and non-White school counterparts.
State reforms had the largest impact in schools with the most room for improvement.
In summary, state-level reforms to the minimum number of math courses required for high
school graduation had large impacts on the completed coursework of Black students and much
smaller impacts on White students. Nearly all of the increase came from basic math courses such
as pre-algebra, algebra and geometry. Effects were concentrated in public schools and indistinguishable from zero in private schools. Among Black students, the reforms had stronger effects
in schools with higher proportions of minority students. The large increase in basic math coursework among Black students, particularly in largely minority schools, is consistent with reforms to
minimum requirements having their greatest impact on students who ex ante would have been
predicted to complete the least amount and quality of math coursework.

State Reforms and Labor Market Outcomes

5.1

Empirical Strategy

To identify the impact of math reforms on labor market outcomes, I apply the same empirical
strategy to the Census data as I did to the transcript data, exploiting the differential timing of the
reforms. I again run simple baseline specifications of the form:

Earningsisc = β1 M athRef ormsc + γF emaleisc + κc + λs + φisc ,

(3)

as well as modified specifications controlling for non-math reforms:

Earningsisc = β1 M athRef ormsc + β2 N onM athRef ormssc + γF emaleisc + κc + λs + φisc . (4)

Here, Earnings represents the annual earnings (in 1999) or natural logarithm of those earnings
for individual i who was born in state s and turned 18 in year c. All independent variables are the
same as in the transcript regressions, so that β1 identifies the reduced form impact of the reforms
from within-state changes in earnings, controlling for cohort-specific shocks.8 I again run most
analyses separately by race, control for gender, cluster standard errors by state and use sampling
weights standardized so that each cohort receives equal weight.9
Before estimating earnings impacts, I explore math reforms’ impact on educational attainment,
the sign of which is theoretically ambiguous. Imposing stricter graduation requirements, such as
exit exams, can make it harder for students, particularly disadvantaged ones, to complete high
school (Dee and Jacob, 2007). More rigorous high school curricula could, however, improve college enrollment and completion rates. The math reforms studied here appear to have neither of
these effects. Table 5 uses all Census respondents, including high school dropouts, and outcomes
indicating achievement of at least a given level of educational attainment. The top row shows
8

Even when I use the natural logarithm of earnings as an outcome, these are not typical Mincer earnings regressions
because they do not control for educational attainment or for experience explicitly. Labor market experience is approximated by the cohort fixed effects, which are equivalent to controlling for a nationwide age profile in earnings. I omit
educational attainment because it is potentially endogenous to the reforms and to parallel the transcript regressions as
closely as possible.
9
Unweighted regressions yield very similar results in all of the analyses that follow.

18

little evidence that math reforms increase high school dropout rates, with point estimates close
to zero and the 95 percent confidence interval ruling out increases in the dropout rate larger than
1.6 percentage points for Black respondents. Subsequent rows show little evidence of impact on
college enrollment, college completion or years of education completed.10 Panel B, which uses
the 2008-15 ACS respondents, shows no indication that reforms induce students to complete high
school with a GED rather than a traditional diploma.
Given that these reforms do not appear to affect high school completion rates, focusing subsequent analyses on adults with at least a high school degree should not generate selection bias. I
focus on high school graduates for two reasons. First, this makes point estimates across the Census
and transcript samples comparable, given that the latter consists only of high school graduates.
Second, most students drop out of high school within their first two years, so that increases in
minimum math coursework requirements have less scope to affect their course choices. I therefore separately analyze the earnings impacts for high school dropouts, whose coursework likely
is unchanged by these reforms.
Figure 5 shows average annual earnings by state reform wave and cohort.11 As shown in panel
A, Black high school graduates in the 1975-1983 cohorts had very similar earnings in both earlyand late-reforming states. A gap opens up between the two sets of states precisely when earlyreforming states begin to implement their reforms. Black high school graduates in the 1984-1987
cohorts have substantially higher earnings in early-reforming states than in late-reforming states.
That earnings difference closes for subsequent cohorts, all of whom were subject to reforms.
For Black students, the timing of the math reforms appears closely connected to earnings.
Panel B shows no such pattern for White students. White high school graduates in early-reforming
states have slightly lower earnings than those in late-reforming states for nearly all cohorts before,
during and after the reforms. Consistent with the evidence on math coursework, state reforms
10
The Census data does not record the field in which a student earned his or her college degree. The ACS records
this starting in 2008. Reduced form regressions using as an outcome an indicator for holding a college degree in a
STEM field show no evidence that math reforms affected students’ major choices. This is unsurprising, given that the
additional courses induced by the reforms were in basic math and that the marginal student affected is unlikely to
either attend college or, if attending, to major in a STEM field.
11
Because earnings are measured in 1999 for cohorts of different ages, this figure resembles a wage-experience profile
with the horizontal axis reversed.

19

seem substantially more influential for the earnings of Blacks than the earnings of Whites.

5.2

Empirical Results

Regression estimates in Table 6 confirm the visual evidence. Being subject to math reforms increases earnings of Black high school graduates by an economically and statistically significant 3.3
percent. This impact is not driven by a changing probability of having non-zero earnings, which
can generate selection bias with a logarithmic specification. A specification that uses earnings as
an outcome, and therefore includes those with zero earnings, shows that reforms increase Black
high school graduates’ annual earnings by $635. Relative to the 1982 cohort’s annual earnings of
$21,760, this represents a 2.9 percent increase. Both specifications thus yield estimated impacts
of similar magnitude. Non-math reforms have little impact on earnings and controlling for such
reforms increases the estimated earning impact of math reforms to 4.5 percent.
While math reforms increased Black high school graduates’ math coursework and subsequent
earnings, groups whose coursework did not change substantially saw no earnings increase. For
White high school graduates, the estimated impact of math reforms on earnings is close to zero and
precise enough to rule out increases larger than 0.8 percent. Similarly, Black and White high school
dropouts saw no apparent increase in earnings.12 The only group whose earnings rose clearly
in response to the math reforms was also the only group whose math coursework rose clearly
in response to those reforms, making it unlikely that differential trends by race or educational
attainment can explain these results.
I explore this further in Table A.5, which shows that estimated earnings impacts generated by
the baseline specification are robust to a variety of alternative specifications. As with the coursework results, controlling for other educational reforms and economic conditions leave earnings
impacts largely unchanged or, if anything, slightly larger. Inclusion of state-specific linear time
trends slightly increases these estimates. Adding observations from the 11 states that did not enact math reforms during this time period increases the earnings impacts from 3.3 to 3.9 percent
and from $635 to $1,140. Limiting the Census sample to the 1982-1994 cohorts, to more closely re12

See Table A.4.

20

semble the transcript sample, changes little about these estimates. All specifications suggest that
math reforms raised earnings of Black high school graduates by between three and four percent
and had little impact on Whites’ earnings.13
The impact of math reforms on Black high school graduates’ earnings is driven by changes in
the middle of the Black income distribution, not the high end of the distribution. I run equation
3 using as outcomes indicators for having annual earnings above various multiples of $5,000. I
report the resulting coefficients and confidence intervals in Figure 6. There is no evidence that
math reforms affect the probability of a Black high school graduate being at the high end of the
earnings distribution. Instead, changes are driven by increases in the probability of being in the
middle of the distribution, with the largest impact a 1.5 percentage point increase in the probability of earning over $30,000. This seems consistent with reforms inducing additional basic math
coursework that appears to pay off for middle-skilled workers, rather than advanced coursework
that might pay off for high-skilled workers. Reforms appear not to affect the distribution of White
high school graduates’ earnings. Including high school dropouts in these samples reduces the
estimated impacts but suggests similar shifts in the overall distribution of earnings.14
Though math reforms did not alter educational attainment, one channel through which they
raised Blacks’ earnings appears to be through increased cognitive skills, as proxied by occupational skill measures. Table 7 shows that Black high school graduates subject to these reforms
reported working in occupations requiring 0.04 standard deviations more cognitive skill. Using
occupational mathematical skill yields a similar estimate. As with earnings, no changes in occupational skill are observed for White high school graduates or Black or White high school dropouts.15
For Black high school graduates in this sample, a one standard deviation increase in occupational
cognitive skill is associated with increased earnings of about $6,200, conditional on state and cohort. This implies that a 0.04 standard deviation increase in such skill should translate to a roughly
13
Earnings impacts on Hispanics are very imprecisely estimated zeroes. Figure A.2 also makes clear that, unlike for
Blacks and Whites, the earnings profile of Hispanics differed greatly in the pre-period by reform timing. Hispanic adults
in early-reforming states earned thousands of dollars more than their counterparts in late-reforming states. Earnings
estimates are also difficult to compare to coursework estimates given the large numbers of Hispanics in the transcript
sample who are likely excluded from the Census sample due to birth outside of the U.S.
14
See Figure A.3.
15
See Table A.6 for impacts on high school dropouts’ occupational skills.

21

$250 increase in annual earnings, or over one-third of the observed effect of the reforms. Given
that both occupation and occupational skill are measured with error here and that occupational
skill is itself a noisy measure of individual skill, this may be a lower bound on the fraction of the
earnings effect explained by occupational upgrading.
As with math coursework, the reforms do not appear to have had clear differential effects
by gender. Table A.7 shows that, for Black high school graduates, reforms had positive impacts
on earnings and occupational cognitive skill for both men and women. Impacts were larger for
male earnings relative to female earnings but larger for female occupational skills relative to male
occupational skills. The differences in impact by gender for all outcomes and subgroups are,
however, statistically insignificant.
To estimate explicitly the extent to which these math reforms closed racial gaps in educational
and labor market outcomes, I pool Black and White high school graduates and run regressions
interacting math reforms with race, of the form:

Yisc = γ1 M athRef ormsc +γ2 M athRef orm∗Blacksc +γ3 Blackisc +γ4 N onM athRef ormssc +ζF emaleisc +ψc +δs +υ
(5)
The coefficient on the Black indicator, γ3 , can be thought of as the average within-state BlackWhite gap in a given outcome. The math reform coefficient, γ1 , estimates the impact of reforms
on Whites, while the interaction term, γ2 , estimates the extent to which the reforms affected the
relevant Black-White gap. Table 8 shows the results of these regressions.
Comparison of the interaction term to the Black indicator suggests that math reforms closed
two-thirds (0.14 courses) of the 0.21 Black-White gap in total math courses completed. As noted
earlier, all of this stemmed from increased coursework in basic math, with reforms having no
apparent impact on the 0.38 Black-White gap in advanced math courses. The reforms also closed
economically meaningful portions of labor market gaps. Using earnings as an outcome, math
reforms closed about 40 percent ($4,210) of the roughly $10,000 Black-White annual earnings gap.
Using the logarithm of earnings as an outcome suggests math reforms reduced by nearly onetenth (two percent) the 26 percent gap in annual earnings. The reforms also closed by more than

22

one-tenth (0.06 standard deviations) the 0.42 standard deviation gap in occupational cognitive
skill.
Finally, I turn to more recent data from the 2001-15 ACS to see whether the earnings impacts
observed in the 2000 Census appear in later years. To improve precision given those smaller sample sizes, I group the ACS waves every five years and replace cohort fixed effects in my baseline
specification with cohort by survey year fixed effects. Table 9 shows the results of these regressions, with the first column replicating prior results from the Census data for purposes of comparison. Two important facts emerge from this analysis.
First, the positive earnings impact observed for Black respondents in the Census data is also
apparent in the early years of the ACS data, though less precisely estimated. Second, the positive
earnings impact for Blacks is no longer apparent in the most recent decade’s worth of data, with
point estimates negative and confidence intervals that rule out effects as large as those seen in
earlier years. Though the precision of these later estimates does not rule out economically meaningful impacts of math reforms, additional math coursework may have been more highly valued
in the labor market of the late 1990s and early 2000s than in the labor market of later years, when
demand for quantiative skills in particular appears to have leveled off (Beaudry et al., 2016). The
impact of high school coursework may also diminish with age, either as skills depreciate or as
untreated individuals improve their skills through other means.

Conclusion

The math coursework reforms studied here induced Black students to complete about 0.35 additional math courses and raised their earnings by 3.3 percent, suggesting each additional math
course had a labor market return of about 10 percent. The Census data suggests the Mincerian
return to an additional year of high school for Black students is about 21 percent.16 Math coursework explains roughly half of the apparent labor market return to a year of high school for such
16
This figure comes from comparing the earnings of Black respondents whose highest level of completed schooling
is either ninth or twelfth grade, conditional on gender, state of birth and cohort. This earnings gap is 64 percent, or
about 21 percent for each of those three years completed. Using those who completed only tenth or eleventh grade as
the baseline yields similar estimates of the return to a year of high school. The comparable estimate for Whites is about
15 percent.

students. Increased earnings can be partly but not wholly explained by shifts toward more cognitively intensive occupations, suggesting real improvements in human capital and productivity. In
this sense, the curricular reforms succeeded at least somewhat in achieving the goal of “A Nation
at Risk,” helping Black students leave high school with better labor market skills. As such, this
paper provides clear evidence that curricular reform has the potential to help close the racial and
socioeconomic earnings gaps that are the focus of so much research and public policy.
The increased graduation requirements studied here did not, however, have much impact on
the majority of students. There is little evidence that higher minimum course requirements improved the productivity of most workers or their capacity to enter the math-intensive occupations
that preoccupied the authors of “A Nation at Risk.” These increased requirements did not increase
advanced math course completion or affect the probability of entering highly paid occupations in
math-intensive fields like engineering. The new graduation requirements generally specified only
the number of courses necessary and not the minimum set of skills students would need in order
to graduate. As such, the reforms focused on the amount of time spent in class rather than the specific content learned. For relatively low-skilled groups of students, additional basic math courses
may have had value, but high-skilled students would have benefited little from them and likely
were already fulfilling the new minimum requirements.
More recent efforts have begun to focus not on the number of math courses completed by students but on the specific content to which students are exposed. High school exit exams that proliferated as a result of No Child Left Behind test such content. Subsequent state reforms to graduation requirements have increasingly identified specific courses required for students to complete.
Recognition of racial and socioeconomic gaps in math coursework have prompted some states
and districts to adopt “Algebra for All” policies that mandate or strongly encourage completion
of algebra courses. Efforts to broaden participation in advanced math coursework has led to a
more than tripling of the numbers of students taking Advanced Placement Calculus exams over
the last 20 years. Future research may be able to identify whether such subsequent curricular
interventions have labor market impacts that resemble the ones estimated here.

Notes: The table shows mean values of key variables, computed using sampling weights standardized so that each
class receives equal weight. Data in panel A come from the NCES transcript studies described in the text. The
sample in panel A consists of high school graduates from the classes of 1982, 1987, 1990 and 1994, graduating high
school from states enacting math reforms. Data in panel B come from the 5-Percent Public Use Microdata Sample of
the 2000 U.S. Census. The sample in panel B consists of high school graduates from the classes of 1975-1994, born in
states enacting math reforms. Annual earnings are total personal earned income from calendar year 1999, measured
in thousands of dollars. Occupational cognitive and math skills are standardized measures of the skills required by
the respondent’s occupation.

Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered by state are in parentheses (* p<.10 ** p<.05 *** p<.01).
Each coefficient comes from a separate regression of a measure of educational attainment on an indicator for being subject to increased math requirements, birth state and cohort fixed effects, and race-by-sex indicators. Evennumbered columns also control for the number of reforms to science, English, social studies, and non-core subjects.
Regressions are weighted by sampling weights standardized so that each class receives equal weight. Outcomes in
the first four rows are indicators for having obtained at least the specified level of educational attainment. Years of
education is generated by imputing 10 years to high school dropouts, 12 to high school graduates, 13 to those with
some college, 14 to those with two-year college degrees and 16 to those with four-year college degrees. Data in panel
A come from the 5-Percent Public Use Microdata Sample of the 2000 U.S. Census and in panel B from the 2008-15
waves of the American Community Survey. The sample consists of the high school cohorts of 1975-1994 born in
states enacting math reforms. Also shown is the mean value of the outcome for the 1982 cohort.

Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered by state are in parentheses (* p<.10 ** p<.05 *** p<.01). Each coefficient comes from a
regression of a measure of earnings on an indicator for being subject to increased math requirements, birth state fixed effects, and a female indicator.
Regressions in column 1-2 include high school class fixed effects, with data from the 5-Percent Public Use Microdata Sample of the 2000 U.S. Census.
Regressions in columns 3-8 include high school class by survey year fixed effects, with data from the 1-Percent Public Use Microdata Sample of the
2001-15 American Community Surveys. Even-numbered columns also control for the number of reforms to science, English, social studies, and noncore subjects. Regressions are weighted by sampling weights standardized so that each class receives equal weight. Outcomes are total personal earned
income in the listed calendar year (measured in thousands of 1999 dollars) and its natural logarithm. The sample consists of high school graduates from
the cohorts of 1975-1994 born in states enacting math reforms.

Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered by state are in parentheses (* p<.10 ** p<.05 *** p<.01).
The top row in each panel comes from regressions of math coursework completed on an indicator for being subject
to increased math requirements, high school state and class fixed effects, and race-by-sex indicators. The second row
adds to the baseline specification the number of reforms in non-math subjects, an exit exam indicator, and the state
unemployment rate in the year of high school graduation. The third row adds to the baseline specification statespecific linear time trends. The fourth row adds to the baseline specification the 11 states that did not enact math
reforms. The fifth row excludes from the baseline specification the five most populous states for each demographic
subgroup. Regressions are weighted by sampling weights standardized so that each class receives equal weight. Data
come from the NCES transcript studies described in the text. The sample consists of those graduating high school in
1982, 1987, 1990 and 1994. Sample sizes are rounded to the nearest 10 students as required by NCES.

Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered by state are in parentheses (* p<.10 ** p<.05 *** p<.01).
Coefficients in each panel and column come from regressions of the listed measure of full-year courses completed
for credit on an indicator for being subject to increased math requirements, high school state and cohort fixed effects,
and race-by-sex indicators. Even-numbered columns also control for the number of reforms to science, English, social
studies, and non-core subjects. Regressions are weighted by sampling weights standardized so that each cohort
receives equal weight. Basic math courses include pre-algebra, algebra I and geometry. Data come from the NCES
transcript studies described in the text. The sample consists of those graduating high school in 1982, 1987, 1990 and
1994 from states enacting math reforms. Also shown is the mean value of the outcome for the 1982 and 1994 cohorts.

The top row of coefficients in each panel comes from a separate regression of a measure of earnings on an indicator
for being subject to increased math requirements, birth state and cohort fixed effects, and race-by-sex indicators. The
second row adds to the baseline specification the number of reforms in non-math subjects, an exit exam indicator, and
the state unemployment rate in the year of high school graduation. The third row adds to the baseline specification
state-specific linear time trends. Regressions are weighted by sampling weights standardized so that each cohort

Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered by state are in parentheses (* p<.10 ** p<.05 *** p<.01).
Coefficients in each panel and column come from regressions of labor market outcomes on an indicator for being
subject to increased math requirements, birth state and cohort fixed effects, and race indicators. Even-numbered
columns also control for the number of reforms to science, English, social studies, and non-core subjects. Regressions
are weighted by sampling weights standardized so that each class receives equal weight. Outcomes are years of
education attained, the natural logarithm of total personal earned income in calendar year 1999, and a standardized
measure of the cognitive skill required by a respondent’s occupation. Data come from the 5-Percent Public Use
Microdata Sample of the 2000 U.S. Census. The sample consists of the high school cohorts of 1975-1994 born in states
enacting math reforms. Panel A includes all individuals while panels B and C exclude high school dropouts. Also
shown is the mean value of the outcome for the 1982 cohort.
