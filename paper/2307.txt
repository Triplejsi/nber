U.S. Firms in Latin American Service Industries

ABSTRACT

The participation of U.S. service industry firms in Latin American
markets for services consists
mainly of the activities of U.S.-owned affi—
hates operating in Latin America and very little of direct exports of services from the U.S. The important
policy issues thus involve barriers to the
establishment and operation of affiliates in host countries rather than
trade barriers. Since direct investment
rather than trade is at issue, the
comparative advantages that are important are those of U.S. multinational
firms rather than those of the U.S. as a country.
The characteristics we observe in U.S. multinationals in these
industries, particularly their low R & D intensity, are not those usually
associated with the comparative advantages of U.S. multinationals. However,
their skill intensity -is relatively
high. A more detailed breakdown of the
sector does show at least some industries,
particularly in finance, in which
skill levels are very high, and these are the most likely candidates for
major gains for U.S. multinationals.
Nevertheless, u.s. shares in the Latin
American service sector are very small overall and not likely to reach the
levels in manufacturing or petroleum in the foreseeable future.

1. Introduction

What is referred to as trade in
minent place on the international

services has recently been given a pro-

policy agenda. To a large extent this is

a result of the current efforts of the

arguing that it would benefit mainly the

developed countries. The reason

international comparative advantage of

the developed countries has shifted from goods to services (see
Bhagwati,
1986, for a discussion).
Given the characteristics of most

service industries, discussed below,

and particularly the fact that much of their output is nontradable,
we
suggest here that what is at issue is not so much

*The research reported here -is part of the NBER's program in International Studies. An earlier version of
this paper was presented at the
conference organized by Sistema Económico
Lat-inoamer-icano (SELA) on "The
World Economy and Latin American Development, Problems and Perspectives,"
Caracas, Venezuela, May 4-8, 1987. We would like to thank the participants
for valuable comments and suggest-ions and SELA for supporting the research.

—2—
In this paper we examine the characteristics of U.S. multinational

firms in service industries. We ask whether these characteristics are
likely to imply strong competitiveness and comparative advantage for these
multinationals relative to developing host countries, using Latin America,

including the Caribbean, as a point of reference. We also estimate the
importance of U.S. foreign direct investment in the Latin American service
sector by relating output and employment of U.S. owned affiliates to total
host country output and employment -in a few individual service industries in

various Latin American countries. The study is based on data for 1982, since
these are the most comprehensive and detailed service industry data available
for U.S. firms.

2. The Tradability of Services
The whole issue of trade -in services has been muddled by the failure to

distinguish among several versions of what constitutes this trade: 1) service transactions that cross national borders (e.g. architectural work by
an architect in New York for a builder in Saudi Arabia); 2) service transactions that do not cross borders, but involve buyers and sellers who are
residents of different countries (tourism) and are therefore defined as

service items in the balance of payments; and 3) service indust activities in a country by firms owned by Foreigners.

Of these three types of activity, the first is very minor, outside of

the transactions that take place within multinational Firms. Those within
multinational firms mostly involve goods industries rather than service

industries and, in any case, are ancillary to the sale of goods. The
second type, consisting mainly of tourism and transportation, is a major

-3—
item in the balance of payments, but is not the focus of demands for

liberalization. it is the third group that is most important, at least to
the United States. It involves a set of industries in which the U.S. considers itself to have some comparative advantage, and it accounts for
almost all the service industry sales to foreigners by U.S. firms. It is
therefore likely to be the center of any set of negotiations.
To understand the U.S. interest in negotiations on service trade, we
thus have to examine the service-industry activities of U.S. firms

operating overseas. The total sales of U.S.-owned overseas affiliates in
trade and service industries, broadly defined, amounted to over $450
billion in 1982 as compared with $359 billion in manufacturing, less than
$200 billion in petroleum and coal production, and $23 billion in other

goods-producing industries. That figure undoubtedly exaggerates the amount
of U.S. firms' activity in foreign service industries for several reasons.
One is that it includes wholesale and retail trade, the sales of which consist to a large extent of commodities with relatively little service value

added. Excluding these industries, although they do involve a substantial
amount of service output, still leaves over $180 billion in service

industry sales. This is far larger than direct U.S. service export transactions ($28 billion for travel and transportation and about $9 billion
for other nonfactor services aside from royalties and fees). Thus, outside
the travel and transportation area, the sale of services by U.S. firms to

buyers outside the U.S. is performed almost entirely by U.S. controlled
firms operating in foreign countries, that is, by direct investment rather

than by international trade (for more details on this point, see Kravis,
1985, and Lee and Naya, 1986).

-4—
3. Characteristics of U.S. Multinationals in Service Industries
Services have become much more important in U.S. direct investment over
the last 30 years or so, and account for approximately a third of total

U.S. direct investment today (Lipsey, 1987).1 The finance part of the service sector, in particular, grew very rapidly, as did wholesale trade to a
lesser extent. Other service industries involved only a small part of
investment.

Service industries are often thought of as being labor-intensive and as
employing relatively unskilled and poorly educated workers. These
industries are also expected to invest little in research and development

and to participate hardly at all in international trade. They are sometimes, in fact, referred to as the nontradables sector of an economy.

If the

service industries were, in fact, characterized by low physical capital,
human capital, and R & D intensity, it would be surprising to find that

these industries would be the ones in which firms from advanced countries

would have any comparative advantage. Developing countries would have
little to fear, and also little to gain, from giving them free access to
their markets.

3.1 Service Industry Parent Companies
The characteristics of parent companies are of interest, because they
describe the attributes of the firms that are carrying out the investment

in service industries in other countries. Presumably, these parent characteristics reflect at least some of the firm-specific advantages that the

1The definition of the service sector varies among authors who write
about it (see Stigler, 1956, Fuchs, 1968, and Kuznets, 1966). A very broad
definition of the service sector would be that it encompasses all the
industries not covered in the goods-producing sectors. That could include

affiliates bring with them. Ideally, we would describe the characteristics
of parents of service-industry affiliates, but the data we have refer

instead to service industry parents of affiliates in all industries. These
parents own mainly service industry affiliates, but do not include, for
example, those parents that are in manufacturing or mining, but own affiliates in service industries.

The information available for parents is much more limited than that

for affiliates. We can, however, say something about factor intensities,
average size, foreign trade, and technological inputs and income.
With respect to physical capital intensity,2 the comparison between
parents in service industries and parents in manufacturing or extractive

industries is very sensitive to the definition of service industries. The
reason is that the physical capital intensities in services vary over a
tremendous range, far larger than that in manufacturing, and the inclusion
or exclusion of an industry can easily reverse the results of a comparison.

construction, government, transportation, communication, and public utilities, as well as trade, finance, and personal and business services. We
will concentrate our attention on narrower versions of the service sector.
We exclude government entirely, since it is not a field for direct investment, and we exclude public utilities and transportation, because these are
not usually counted in the service sector, and because they are governmentowned in many countries. We are inclined to exclude wholesale trade, or at
least segregate it, in studying investment, because U.S.-owned wholesale
trade affiliates are mainly sales affiliates of U.S. manufacturing companies, and their sales are largely commodities. We exclude holding companies, where possible, because they are basically a conduit for U.S.
investment rather than a part of host-country service industries. They
might hold portfolio investments or, if they control foreign companies,
those would appear under their appropriate industry categories. Finance
operations in the Netherlands Antilles are excluded because they are also
largely conduits, in this case for their parents' borrowing.
2The measure of physical capital intensity we use here is the value of
net property, plant, and equipment divided by the number of employees.
(For a fuller discussion, see Kravis and Lipsey, 1986). A drawback of the
number employed as the labor input measure is that it ignores differences

(T.C. and P) are more physical capital

intensive than those in manufacturing or all industries combined (see Table

1). However, once the T.C. and P. group is removed, the remaining service
industry parents seem to be relatively labor intensive on average, even if
the capital-intensive real estate industry is included.

Our measure of human capital intensity has far less variance than that

of physical capital intensity. As can be seen in Table 2, parents in trade

among industries in the quality of the labor force. We chose to treat these
differences in quality as representing differences in human capital or skill
intensity, rather than differences in labor input.

-7and services are below average in human capital intensity and below those in
manufacturing, but again, they straddle the other groups. Parents in some
of the service industries, such as the ones related to petroleum, nonbank-ing
finance, advertising, and management consulting are above manufacturing
parents and all parents -in human capital intensity.

Service industry companies are often pictured as being relatively

small—scale operations. In fact, as measured by assets, service industry
parents are, on the average, large in comparison with manufacturing parents

or with parent companies -in general (see Table 3). The high average asset
size of service industry parents reflects mainly the inclusion of banking
parents (average assets over $7.5 billion), other finance (almost $3

-8—
billion), retail trade, and petroleum wholesale trade, all larger on the

average than manufacturing parents. However, parents in non-petroleum wholesale trade and in other services were smaller than those in manufacturing, on average.

3.2 Characteristics of U.S. Affiliates in. Latin American Service Industries
A distinctive characteristic of U.S. investment in services in developing Western Hemisphere countries is that the number of U.S. parents is

small, except in a few financial centers. In those few, however, the
number of parent firms is very large. For example, of 151 U.S. parents
that had any banking affiliates abroad in 1982, almost all (135) had one or
more in developing Western Hemisphere countries (mainly in the Bahamas or

—gin British Caribbean islands), but

only 71 had banking affiliates in Europe.

Of 710 U.S. parents that had any affiliates in finance other than banking,
including insurance and real estate, almost 500 had affiliates in Latin
America or other Western Hemisphere

developing countries. Principally these

were located in Bermuda and the Netherlands Antilles, but also in Panama,
the Bahamas, and the British Caribbean islands. Outside of these cases the
numbers of parent companies in most countries were very small.

While the characteristics of parent companies
may be passed on to host
countries through their affiliates, a much more direct source of effects on

- 10

-

host countries must be the extent and characteristics of affiliate activity. That activity has many facets such as its distribution among
industries, its factor intensities, the technological characteristics and

trading patterns of affiliates, the taxes they pay to host-country governments, and the incomes they provide to host-country residents.

Factor intensities

The capital intensity of parents does

not necessarily carry over to

their foreign affiliates if the firm can split its activities into different types and carry them on at different

locations. In fact, the physi—

cal capital intensities of parents do not carry over to affiliates
very
precisely, although the 5 industries in which

parents' physical capital

intensities were highest were also the ones in which affiliate capital
intensities were highest (Appendix Tables 8 and 9). The correlation was much
stronger for skill or human capital intensities.

Over the whole range of

industries, higher skill intensity in parents was associated with high skill

intensity in affiliates. There are two ways in which this could come about.
One is that skill intensity is

an industry or firm characteristic that is pre-

sent wherever the firm operates. The other

is that high skill intensity firms

concentrate their operations in high wage countries. Within Latin America,
the former explanation seems to be the

predominant one. There, the skill

intensive U.S. industries by and large have affiliates with high compensation

per worker. However, the latter factor does operate to some extent. That is,
within the service sector, the industries

with lower skill levels, such as

hotels and lodging, real estate, and miscellaneous business services, are
somewhat more heavily represented among affiliates in Latin America than
among
all U.S. affiliates around the world. Furthermore, some of the high—skill
industries, such as management consulting,

finance other than banking, and

advertising, are relatively little represented in Latin American affiliates of

U.S. firms (see Appendix Table 9).
As might be expected, affiliates in the trade and service sector were

— 14 -

not particularly physical-capital intensive (see Table 7). However, service industries, broadly defined, were heavier users of physical capital
than manufacturing industries. A disaggregatiofl, as in the case of service
industry parents, identifies the source of the high capital intensity: the
transportation, communication, and public utility industries, with over
$100,000 in physical assets per worker and, not far behind, petroleum who-

lesalers. Aside from those, the trade and service sector was a little less
capital-intensive than manufacturing, but the margin was not large for most

service industries. Low physical capital intensity has not been a particular feature of service industry affiliates.

The stereotype of service industries mentioned earlier is similarly not

supported by data on average compensation in affiliates, our measure of

- 15

—

human capital intensity. Table 8 shows that
average compensation (average

human capital per employee) was a little higher in trade and services than
in all industries and manufacturing.

The same was true for most individual

service industries. The only really low-wage industry in the group was
retail trade, and several of the industries

paid quite high wages.

Within Latin America, the skill intensity of service industries was
again above the average for all industries and that for manufacturing. And
here too, the only outstandingly low—skill

industry was retail trade. By

and large, the lower—skill industries in Latin America were the same ones
as in affiliates as a whole (see Appendix Table

9).

3.2.3.

R & 0 and export intensities

A characteristic of firms that is sometimes referred to as a factor
intensity, or as something close to it, is the R&D intensity, measured in

various ways. A typical one, on which we have data for majority-owned
affiliates, is the ratio of R&D expenditures to sales. Service industries
are not usually considered leaders in this respect and the data for affi—

hates support this impression.
U.S. affiliates in all industries invest relatively little in R&D, as
compared to parents, and affiliates in services, by any definition, invest

less than those in manufacturing. Affiliates in Latin America, in every
service industry shown, and in petroleum and manufacturing also, spend much
less on R&D than those in other countries relative to their sales, typi-

cally about a third as much or even less (see Table 9). Thus, the picture
of service industries as being little involved with R&D is confirmed, especially for affiliates, and even more for affiliates in Latin America.

On a less detailed industry classification we can also examine the
export propensities of service industry affiliates.

Overall, as Table 10

shows, the trade and service sector does not appear to be less oriented to

exporting than the manufacturing or petroleum sectors. As with respect to

other characeerstjcs, the service sector is extremely heterogeneous.
Affiliates in wholesale trade are more export oriented than those in manufacturing, even though they are mainly distributors of manufactured pro-

ducts. And finance affiliates in the Caribbean countries are almost
entirely involved -in the sale of services outside their host countries. In

these cases, not only the sale, but also much of the production of services
appears to take place outside the host countries, to the extent that one can

— 18 -

even attribute production to a location in some of these industries. That is
suggested by the small amount of employment relative to the sales or assets of

affiliates located in these countries. Affiliates in other service
industries, including finance affiliates outside the Caribbean, other services, and retail trade, do export relatively little, although the proportion
is not insignificant——20 per cent for affiliates in services other than
finance.

Latin American affiliates in petroleum are much more export-oriented

than others, and those in wholesale trade a little more than average. The
distinctive feature of affiliates in Latin America is the very low export

orientation of manufacturing affiliates. Those in nonfinancial service
industries are also relatively uninvolved in exporting.

In sum, we find little support in the data on U.S. multinationals for

- 19

—

the usual picture of the service sector
as being composed of low-Skill,
labor-intensive industries serving

only host-country markets. The service

sector is extremely heterogeneous, but the general impression from our
investigation is that multinationals

producing services are not, on the

average, very different from other multinationals

in physical capital inten-

sity and their export orientation, but they are somewhat more skill-

intensive than others. Affiliates in finance and wholesale trade are
heavily involved in exporting, while those in other services and retail

trade are not. The picture of service
in R & 0 is, however, confirmed,

industries as being little involved

especially for affiliates, and even more so

for affiliates in Latin America.
liates in Latin America (excluding

Otherwise, U.S. service industry affiCaribbean banking) were found to be

rather similar in their characteristics to those in other areas.

4. U.S. Affiliates' Share of Latin American Service Sectors
Despite the recent concern in many Third World countries about foreign

direct investment in service

sectors, very little is known about the extent

to which foreign firms participate in the production of services in these

developing countries. The available data do not permit any detailed examination of this issue for Latin America

as a whole, but the meager published

data, relatively aggregated and far from perfect, give a rough idea of the
share of value added in Latin American

service sectors that is accounted for

by U.S. affiliates (see Table 13). These shares are somewhat underestimated
since the "value added" for U.S. affiliates that can be calculated from the

published u.s. direct investment surveys does not include interest payments

and depreciation, although these were collected. However, the inclusion of
these missing items could not change the overall picture.

These calculations suggest that U.S. affiliates accounted for over 93
per cent of the production of financial services in Latin America in 1982.
However, that figure is dominated by U.S. banking activities in the Caribbean.

Aside from these, the percentage share is only 25 per cent. Their share of
wholesale and retail trade was a bit over one per cent, while that in
transportation and communication, which we do not generally include in ser-

vices, was only a third of a per cent. Thus, U.S. multinationals' share of
service production in Latin America seems to be very low, and much lower than
their share of manufacturing production.

The impression that U.S. affiliates play a relatively unimportant role
in Latin American financial services carries over to figures for individual

countries. As Table 14 shows, their share of both value added and
employment was less than 2.7 per cent in all the reporting countries for
which data are available.

However, one should not forget that the Latin American service sector
is highly heterogeneous, and our data on the size of aggregate service production include not only a wide variety of services, but presumably also a high

degree of informal sector activities. Therefore, despite their lOW share of
aggregated services, U.S. affiliates may play an important role in some
"modern't parts of these service industries. Furthermore, the role of foreign
firms in Latin American banking and finance may be much more important than is
indicated by production or employment because the U.S. branches may function
as a bridge between the international capital markets and the host countries.
5. Concluding Remarks
The participation of U.S. service industry firms in Latin American
markets for services consists mainly of the activities of U.S.-owned affi-

— 22

hates

—

operating in Latin America and very little of direct exports of ser-

vices from the U.S. The important poicy issues thus involve barriers to
the establishment and operation of affiliates in host countries rather than
trade barriers. Since direct investment rather than trade is at issue, the
comparative advantages that are important are those of U.S. multinational
firms rather than those of the U.S. as a country.

The characteristics we observe for U.S. service-industry multinationals
as a group are not those usually associated with multinational firms! com-

parative advantages. In particular, those firms are much less R & Dintensive than those in goods production. The characteristic that does
suggest the possibility of multinationals! comparative advantage is the
somewhat higher skill level in service-industry multinationals than in goods

industry firms. Of course, a more detailed breakdown of the service
industry sector would reveal some much more skill-intensive subgroups, and
in some of these there may be large multinational company advantages.

Some rough calculations of the U.S. participation in Latin American
service production also suggested that the role of multinationals may have

been exaggerated in the public debate. U.S. affiliates accounted for only
an extremely small proportion (less than 3 per cent) of the production of
financial services in Latin America, and their share in wholesale and

retail trade was only a bit over one per cent. But again, a more detailed
breakdown of the data would probably show that multinationals play an
important role in certain service industries.

As far as we can see, the importance of liberalization of "trade in
services" to both developed and developing countries has probably been

— 23 -

exaggerated.

(For a similar view, see McCulloch, 1987.) For one thing, the

term "trade in services" is a misnomer; there is very little such trade.
Almost all the issues involve market access through direct investment.
While these issues may be important to a few industries, particularly financial services, it seems unlikely that any great gains to the balance of

payments of the U.S. or great gains or losses for developing countries are
at stake.
