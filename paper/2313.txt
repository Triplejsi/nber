Sectoral

and National Aggregate Disturbances

to Industrial Output in Seven European Countries

ABSTRACT

A class of real business cycle models suggests that shocks to technology

can explain aggregate fluctuations in output and employment. This paper
begins from the premise that shocks to productivity may vary across
industries but are unlikely to vary systematically across national boundaries

for a set of developed countries. Alternative sources of macroeconomic
fluctuations, however, such as those due to nation-specific government

policies, may produce variations in output growth across nations that are

common to industries. This paper discusses these implications within the
context of a simple theoretical model, then the paper decomposes the
quarterly and annual growth rate of industrial production In two-digit

manufacturing industries in seven European countries and the United States
into components that are specific to industries but common to nations, and

idiosyncratic components. The paper shows that shocks that are
nation-specific and common to industries are important, and cast doubt on the
hypothesis that most macroeconomic fluctuations can be ascribed to shocks to
technology.

Introduction

Much of macroeconomic analysis is concerned with the effects of changes

in national economic policies — monetary, fiscal, or other policies — on
aggregate output. Fluctuations in aggregate output are frequently thought to
result from changes in national policies. At the same time, "real business
cycle models" have suggested that a large fraction of fluctuations in
aggregate output may result from such disturbances as technology shocks.
Clearly, technology shocks may be important without precluding roles for

monetary or fiscal impulses as central to business cycles. But it is
difficult to isolate and date specific technological changes in various
industries, let alone form a time series of technical shocks that could be
controlled for in macroeconomic analysis to investigate the importance of

other (e.g. monetary) disturbances. This paper presents some research
designed to get around this problem. The paper seeks to isolate changes in
output that are due to aggregate national 'policy' changes (in a broad sense)
or to aggregate nation-specific disturbances, from changes in aggregate

output that are associated with disturbances such as technical change in a

particular sector of the economy. To accomplish this decomposition, the
paper uses a simple statistical model that is assumed to generate industrial
production data for a panel of ten 2-digit industries across eight countries,
over 21 years.

This paper investigates the source of disturbances to fluctuations in the
growth rate of output by examining whether the fluctuations in industrial

production in seven European countries and the US over the past two decades

2

reflect mainly disturbances like changes in monetary and fiscal policies that
should be shared by industries within a country but not necessarily by other

countries. The paper seeks to determine what fraction of the variations in
output growth can be attributed to industry-specific shocks and what fraction

can be attributed to nation-specific shocks. The natural interpretation of
nation-specific disturbances is that they result from differences in

government policies followed (at a point in time) by the governments of the

nations in the sample. As argued below, this is not the only reasonable
interpretation, though.

The attempt to isolate the changes in output due to national policies (or
other nation-specific events) relies on the assumption that there have been
differences in such policies across the countries studied over the sample

period. Most open-economy analyses of the effects of changes in policies
imply that the effects at home differ from the effects of the domestic policy

changes on foreign countries. Monetary theories of business fluctuations,
whether of the "sticky nominal price or wage" type (due to contracts signed
in nominal terms, menu costs, or other reasons) or of the "Incomplete
information' type (with confusion of nominal and relative price changes)
predict that an innovation to the domestic money supply will have an

expansionary effect on the domestic economy, while the effect on foreign
economies will be smaller or different In character, depending on the precise

theory of how money affects real variables. Fiscal policies are also
predicted to have different effects at home and abroad in most economic

models. "Real business cycle" theories are less clear on this point, since
they do not (or at least need not) share a common view on the source of

3

disturbances, except that they are "real.' Disturbances that cause changes
in aggregate output could include fiscal and regulatory policies of nations,

or — what is more common In the models — productivity

disturbances that

have little to do with national boundaries but are likely to differ across

Industries. Most of the rest of this paper will identify "real business
cycle theory" with what is actually only a subset of that theory: models in
which exogenous industry-specific productivity shocks play a major role.

This class includes Long and Plosser, 1983, and Is In the spirit of the
models of Kydland and Prescott (1981), Hansen (1985), and Prescott (1986).

The paper first estimates Industry-specific and nation-specific
disturbances and the fractions of output-growth variation attributable to

each. It then compares the nation-specific disturbances to determine how
similar or dissimilar are aggregate fluctuations that have been "purged' of
industry-specific shocks, and examines how these nation-specific shocks are

related to each other. The estimated nation-specific time-series may differ
from the usual measures of aggregate output growth (such as aggregate GNP or
industrial production indexes) because industry-specific shocks have been

removed. Consequently, these series may provide a better indication of the
results of national government policies than does measured aggregate output.

These series might also provide better indications of the joint dynamics of
aggregate fluctuations induced by national policies than would the measured

aggregate series. The paper investigates those joint dynamics. These
indexes may also be useful in Investigating the International transmission of
aggregate disturbances induced by government policies, and to examine such
Issues as the effects of institutional changes like the breakdown of
Bretton-Woods and the adoption of floating exchange rates.

4

This paper does not estimate an economic model; It is restricted to a

purely statistical model. But a large class of macroeconomic models would
appear to be consistent with the basic statistical model, so the results may
have natural interpretations and may be useful in guiding further theoretical

analysis. The next section discusses the basic statistical model and the
date. Section 3 presents an interpretive economic model designed to help
motivate the statistic model. Section 4 presents the main results.

2. The Statistical Model and the Data
A large class of models like the one presented in this paper can be
formulated to imply, as a log-linear approximation,

(1)

dlnIP(I,n,t) =

m(I,n)

+

f(i,t)

+

g(n,t)

+

u(I,nt)

where IP(i,n,t) represents the index of industrial production in industry i

in nation n at time t and dinIP represents its growth rate. The term m(i,n)
is the mean over time of output growth in industry i in nation n. The term
f(I,t) represents the interaction of a fixed effect (in variance components
terminology) for industry i with a fixed time effect, that is, f(i,t) is a
vector of dummy variables specific to industry i and to time t but common to

all nations. (To be more precise, f(i,t) is a vector of coefficients of
these dummy variables multiplied by the dummy variables themselves.) It is
intended to represent disturbances to production functions, input prices, or
product demands that would affect production in industry I In all nations.

The term g(n,t) is the Interaction of a fixed effect for nation n with a

5

fixed effect for time, i.e. it is a vector of dummy variables (multiplied by
their coefficients) for each nation n at each time period t, but is common
across industries.

It is intended to represent the effects of

nation-specific disturbances such as changes in monetary or fiscal policies

that affect output differently in that nation than in other nations. The g
term may also represent other aggregate disturbances that differ across
nations, unrelated to policy differences, though "policy," broadly defined,

seems to be the most natural interpretation. In some of the results
discussed below, the g(n,t) term is decomposed into a seasonal component,

gs(n,t), and a nonseasonal component, gns(n,t). Finally, u(i,n,t) is an
idiosyncratic disturbance to industry i in nation n at time t, assumed to be

an i.i.d. random variable. Estimation of (1) was performed with SAS Proc
GLM.

Identification of the model is discussed below.

The model (1) was estimated with quarterly seasonally-unadjusted data
(aggregated to annual data for some of the results) on indexes of Industrial

production in ISIC industries 20, 31-38, and 40. These are mining (20),
food, beverages, and tobacco (31), textiles and clothing (32), wood and wood
products (33), paper and paper products (34), chemicals and chemical

products (35), non-metallic mineral products (36), primary metals (37), metal

products, machinery, and equipment (38), and utilities (40). Data span from
19641 through 198511 for eight countries: Germany, France, Italy, Belgium,
the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and the United States.

Data were taken from the OECD and national publications, and are available
from the author in printout or on floppy disk.

6

This model (1) Is obviously unidentified, but combinations of parameters

can be identified through a set of normalizations. The normalization chosen
for the results below sets g(n*,t)

0 for one specific nation, n. In all

of the results reported below except those that exclude the United States in

Table 1, nation n is the United States. (Otherwise n is Switzerland.)
Then the time series g(n) =

(g(n,l),...,g(n,T))

for other nations can be

interpreted as a (time-varying) nation effect for nation n relative to the

United States. The (time-varying) industry effects f(i) =

(f(i,l)

f(i..T)) must also be interpreted relative to this normalization.

So the estimated industry effects are estimates of the growth rates of output
in each industry in the United States.

The nation and industry effects, f(i) and g(n), may be correlated. If
the data were balanced, i.e., if observations were available for all

industry-nation pairs at each time period, then the correlations between the

industry effects and the nation effects would be zero. But the data are
unbalanced, e.g. data for industry 31 (food, beverages, and tobacco) were not
available for France until 1969, and data for industry 33 (wood and wood
products) were not available for any nation in the sample until at least
1976. With unbalanced data, the nation and industry effects are correlated.
In order to decompose output growth variations into fractions explained by

Industry effects and fractions explained by nation effects, the paper reports
the fractions explained by the orthogonal components of f and g, and the
fraction attributable to the covariation of f and g.

The motivation behind the formulation (1) is simple. Roughly, if the
main exogenous forces driving short-term variations in the growth rate of

7

industrial production are due to innovation and productivity shocks, then
those shocks are likely to be concentrated in one industry or a set of
industries, but should have little if anything to do with national

boundaries. The f(i,t) terms should then be important, but the g(n,t) terms
should be unimportant. If the main exogenous disturbances are due to
exogenous national variations in monetary or fiscal policies — and if these

variations in policies differ across nations — then the g(n,t) terms should
be important but the f(i,t) terms should be unimportant. The formulation (I)
permits estimation without measurement of any actual policies and without
assuming very much dynamic structure on the data (with the cost of estimating

a large number of parameters). The next section attempts to make this
motivation more precise; some readers may prefer to skip to the results in
Section 4.

probably

unimportant for analysis of cyclical fluctuations; that choice

affects factor allocations across Industries, however, because if the
productivity terms remain uncertain when factors are allocated to industries,

those allocations will be affected by attempts to reduce risk (e.g. by
allocating more or fewer factors to industries with greater productivity
risk, depending on whether the degree of relative risk aversion is larger or

smaller than one). Assume that productivity shocks are observed before
factor allocations are determined. Both A't and the function F() are assumed
to be common to nations.

to al1ow for the results of various national government policies, so it is

10

assumed that L°

(7)

L°

is a function of a vector of policies,

=

LO(gfl).

These "other' uses of labor may be nonproductive, as when government policies

lead to inefficiencies or rent-seeking. In a model with nominal rigidities
they may result from insufficient aggregate demand, affected by the vector g
of government policies.

Obviously, without international differences In government policies or

the distribution of the specific factors T' ,

this

model would do nothing to

distinguish nations from one another. Witout these elements the composition
of industries would be identical across nations in the equilibrium.
(Otherwise, without the specific factors, times will arise when some nations

have industries with higher productivity terms A1 than do other nations, and
this will require greater labor effort to be expended by people with the

larger marginal products of labor. Since this adds unnecessary variance to
labor effort and the marginal utility of leisure is decreasing, it cannot be

the competitive equilibrium.) So, in equilibrium, all nations would have
Identical compositions of industry, and there would be no trade.
With the specific factors T'

distributed differently across nations,

the industrial composition will differ across countries. As a result, total
employment or hours worked will differ across countries. Consider a positive
technology shock to industry j holding fixed all other technology terms. A
country with a larger share of industry j (per capita) has a greater marginal

11

product of labor than a country with a smaller share of industry j. In
equilibrium, this will require greater labor effort from people in the former

country. The assumption that utility Is additively separable in consumption
and leisure prevents this difference in leisure from making consumption of

goods differ across countries, Generally, the equilibrium can be expressed

nation-specific component, and an idiosyncratic component.

Then estimates of the time series f(i,t) and g(n,t) can be obtained.

The model shows that the Industry-specific component will be large if the

industry-specific productivity shocks are important. The nation-specific
component, however, can arise for two general types of reasons. First, the
nation-specific component will be nonzero if national differences in

government policies change over time, and these policies have effects similar

to those modeled above. (The important point is probably not that they
operate through labor allocations alone, rather than allocations of capital
or other factors, but that they have effects that differ across countries.)
Second, the nation-specific effect can be nonzero even if national
government policies have no effects on the growth of' output, but nations

differ in their responses to Industry-specific productivity shocks.

In the

model above, a productivity shock in one industry can raise output in other
industries in one country relative to another because of differences in the

0),

total labor use will be greater in

As a result, the shadow price of labor

will be greater in nation n. So the response of labor supply to any
particular productivity shock differs across nations. The result Is that the
presence of nation-specific g(n,t) terms in estimates of (1) does not
necessarily imply that national government policies have effects as In the
model above; these terms can arise solely because of different responses

across nations to the same industry-specifIc productivity disturbance. In
the model above, this requires that total 1abor effort (per capita) differ
across countries; the effect vanishes if conditions for factor-price

equalization are met. Because per capita labor does not differ substantially
across countries In the sample examined here, It seems unlikely that

different national responses to the same industry-specific productivity
shocks would account for large estimates of g(n,t).

4. Results
Summary statistics from estimation of equation (1) with annual data (the
difference of the log of annual industrial production indexes that were

aggregated from the quarterly data) are reported in Table 1. The sample goes
through 1984, because quarterly data went through only the first half of

1985. Part A of the table summarizes results for the whole sample.

15

The model (1) explains about 3/4 of the variation in industrial production

growth rates. Both the industry (by time) effects f(i,t) and the nation (by
time) effects g(n,t) are significantly nonzero. The F statistics, for
testing the null hypothesese that all of the f(i,t) terms or the g(n,t) terms
are zero, are 2.61 and 2.94, with marginal significance levels (P in the

table) of .0001. This indicates the presence of industry-specific
disturbances that are common to nations as well as nation-specific

disturbances that are common across industries. The total sum of squares
attributable to the industry effects f(i,t) and the nation effects g(n,t) Is

3.27, which Is about half of the total sum of squares. Because the data are
unbalanced, f(i,t) and g(n,t) are correlated. Table 1 shows the variance
decomposition. The sum of squares attributable to the orthogonal part of
f(i,t) is .9 (i.e. this is the sum of squares attributable to the part of
f(i,t) that is orthogonal to g(n,t)), the sum of squares attributable to the
orthogonal part of g(n,t) is .79, and the remainder of the 3.27 is

attributable to the covariation between f(i,t) and g(n,t). So about
one-fifth of the variation explained by the model is attributable to the
orthogonal portion of the industry effects and one-sixth to the orthogonal

portion of the nation effects; about one-third Is attributable to the

covariation between industry and nation effects. The annual nation effects
and industry effects estimated In Table 1A are graphed in the Appendix, where
estimated values are also presented (as NATPAR for the estimated nation
effects g(n,t), along with associated t-statistics, and as INDPAR for the
estimated industry effects f(i,t), along with their associated t-statistics).

The estimates reported In the Table'do not normalize the mean of the g(n,t)
to zero; Instead, they normalize g(n, 1984) = 0 for all n. The means of the

16

nation effects from Table 1A are reported, along with their standard errors,

in Table 6. Residuals from the estimation in Table 1A show little evidence
of autocorrelatlon (that is, the time series of residuals for each
industry-nation pair shows little evidence of autocorrelation).

Recall that the g(n,t) terms are normalized so that g(n*,t) is

identica1l zero for some nation n*, which is the United States unless
otherwise noted. So the significant nation effects indicate that the
European nations experienced disturbances, common to industries, that
differed from nation-specific disturbances (again common to industries) in

the United States. Note that this normalization does not affect the question
of what fractions of variance are explained by the nation effects and

industry effects. To determine whether there are significant nation effects
within the set of European countries, the United States was excluded from the

sample. Part B of Table I shows results when nation effects are normalized
on Switzerland (i.e. when it is nation n*). Again both the industry-specific
and nation-specific effects are significantly nonzero, and the fractions of
variation explained are not affected much by the exclusion of the United

States. Similar results hold regardless of which of the European nations Is
chosen for the normalization. Clearly the results do not indicate that the
main difference between countries Is between the United States on the one
hand and the set of European countries on the other; differences between
nation effects within the European countries are just as Important as between
them and the United States.

The nation-specific effects relative to the United States, estimated in
Table 1A, can be used to investigate the behavior of aggregate output

17

"purged" of industry-specific disturbances, as graphed in the Appendix.
Tables 8 and 10 present autocorrelation coefficients of these nation effects

and results from univariate autoregressions. Only the United Kingdom nation
effects show a significant tendency toward mean-reversion, though there is
weaker evidence of mean-reversion for the nation effects of all of the other

nations except the Netherlands, which has positive autocorrelations. With
the exception of the United Kingdom, the results are somewhat consistent with
those found by Campbell and Mankiw (1986) with quarterly United States

measured aggregate data: the growth rate of output is either serially
uncorrelated or, as in the case of the Netherlands, has positive serial

correlation. In these cases, disturbances to output (the estimated nation
effect) are largely permanent, with the exception of the United Kingdom. On
the other hand, with the exception of the Netherlands, the evidence is not
inconsistent with a weak mean-reversion of the kind found by for the United
States by Cochrane (1986).

Table 12 presents simple contemporaneous correlations among these nation

effects. They are highly correlated: coefficients range from .40 between
Italy and the United Kingdom to .87 between Belgium and France. The United
Kingdom nation effect has, overall, the smallest correlation with the others.
The estimated nation effects in Table 1A differ from aggregate industrial

production indexes for the countries, but they have fairly high correlations

with them. Table 14 shows the standard deviations of the estimated nation
effects from Table 1A, and the standard deviations of the grwoth rate of
industrial production in each nation relative to the grwoth rate of

industrial production in the United States. The table also shows the simple

18

correlations between the estimated nation effects from Table 1A and the

difference between the growth rates of the industrial production indexes for

the country and the United States. Overall, the estimated nation effects
show somewhat more variation than the (relative) measured Industrial

production indexes. The two exceptions are Switzerland and the United
Kingdom. The correlations are around .9, ranging from .84 for the
Netherlands to .99 for Italy.

Table 2 shows estimates of equation (1) with quarterly data. Plots of
the data made it clear that there were substantial differences across

countries in the seasonal behavior of output growth. So the nation-specific
effect g(n,t) was divided into two components,

g(n,t)

gs(n,q) +

gns(n,t)

where gs(n,q) is a vector of separate seasonal dummies for each nation
(multiplied by their coefficients) and gns(n,t) is the nonseasonal part of
nation effect.

In the estimation, gns(n,t) is specified exactly as g(n,t)

was previously. But given gs(n,q), gns(n,t) now has the interpretation of
the nonseasonal component of the nation effects.
In order to estimate the model with quarterly data, it was necessary to
divide the sample into subsamples as shown in Table 2.

The table presents

summary statistics and a variance decomposition from the estimation.

Industry effects f(i,t) are significantly nonzero, as in Table 1. The
seasonal components of the nation effects, gs(n,q) are also significant. But
the nonseasonal nation effects, gns(n,t) are close to zero; the F statistic

19

for testing the hypothesis that the orthogonal component of gns(n,t) is zero
is, in each subperiod, close to zero (marginal significance levels are .99).
The quarterly results in Table 2 indicate, In contrast to the Table 1

results, that there are no significant nonseasonal nation-specific
disturbances once industry-specific disturbances and purely seasonal
nation-specific disturbances are accounted for.

Table 2 also shows that the relative importance of the nation effects has
declined over time, while the relative importance of the industry effects has

risen over time. The result that nation effects (relative to the United
States) have declined over time is similar to Quah's (1986) result that a
(slightly different) set of countries have experienced GNP growth that has

become more similar across countries since the breakdown of Bretton Woods

than before. Some of the large individual coefficients in the quarterly
estimates of the nation effects correspond to particular identifiable events,

e.g. the nation effect for France for 196811, corresponding to the events of

May, 1968 there. The recover comes in the fourth quarter, following normal
vacations in the third quarter.

One hypothesis regarding the absence of nonseasonal nation-specific
effects In these estimates with quarterly data Is that the model (1) assumes
that a nation-specific disturbance has the same effect on the growth rate of

output in all industries in the sample. This is unlikely to be true, given
that the Industries have different cyclical amplitudes. (The standard
deviations of output growth in the food, paper, and utilities Industries, for
exampie, are much lower than those of other Industries, and the standard

deviation of primary metals is higher than the others.) One way to test this

20

hypothesis would be to estimate a modified version of (1),

(1')

dlnIP(1,n,t) =

m(i,n)

+

f(i,t)

+

/31g(n,t)

+

u(i,n,t)

where 31 is a coefficient unique to industry i but common to nations. The
model (1'), however, is nonlinear and continues to include a very large

number of parameters, making estimation infeasible. An alternative but
similar procedure is to adjust the data prior to estimating equation (1) by
dividing the growth rate of output in each industry by its standard error.
This is similar to imposing estimates of /31 in (1') that are proportional to

standard errors. Growth rates of output for each industry i in each nation n
were divided by the standard deviation of the growth rate of output in

industry i in the United States (and multiplied by a constant). This results
in "adjusted data" used to estimate equation (1). Results for quarterly data
are summarized in Table 3, and results for annual data are summarized In

parts C and D of Table 1. Table 3 shows that, for the quarterly data, this
correction makes little difference for the main results. Industry-specific
effects and purely seasonal nation-specific effects are still important, and

nonseasonal nation-specific effects are still close to zero. For the annual
data, the relative fraction of variance attributable to industry-specific
disturbances falls somewhat with this adjustment.
The estimated nation-specific effects and industry-specific effects

obtained by using the adjusted data are listed in the Appendix as ADNATPAR
and ADINTPAR, along with the associated t-statistics, and are graphed as

"adjusted" Industry and nation effects. The means and standard deviations of

21

the adjusted nation effects from Table 1C are listed in Table 7 (the
normalization sets the nation effects equal to zero in 1984).

Autocorrelations and autoregressions of the adjusted nationi effects are

reported in Tables 9 and 11. As with the unadjusted estimates, there is
clear evidence of mean-reversion for the United Kingdom and clear evidence of
positive autocorrelation of nation-specific output growth rates in the

Netherlands. Estimates for the other countries are consistent with either
permanent disturbances to output or some mean-reversion of output. The
adjusted nation-specific effects show lower cross-correlation than the

unadjusted effects; these are reported in Table 13. Table 15 reports the
standard deviations of the adjusted national effects and their correlations
with the growth rate of industrial production in the nation minus the growth

rate of United States industrial production. The correlations are lower than
with the estimates from unadjusted data. They range from .75 for Germany and
the Netherlands to .94 for France.

The residuals from the estimation with quarterly data show evidence of

autocorrelation (for each nation-industry pair). The autocorrelation may be
part of the explanation for the difference between the quarterly and annual

results. If industries differ in the timing of the response of their outputs
to a nation-specific disturbance that is common to industries, then the
estimated nation effects may be smaller with quarterly than with annual data.
To investigate this, equation (1) was estimated again using as data the

residuals from univariate regressions of output growth in each nation and

22

industry on four lags of itself. Specifically, residuals v(1,n,t) from the
autoregressions (for all i, n)

dlnIP(i,n,t) =

+

a0

+

a1dlnlP(i,n,t-1)

a3dlnIP(i,n,t-3)

+

+

a2dlnIP(i,n,t-2)

a4dlnIP(i,n,t-4)

+

v(i,n,t)

were used to replace dlnIP(i,n,t) in equation (1). The results of estimating
(1) with these residuals are summarized in Table 4.

The results for the

nonseasonal nation-specific effects change dramatically: they are now
jointly significant at .0001 or .0002, depending on the subsample.

The

results also show a difference across subsamples in the importance of

industry-specific effects: they were not very important in the first
subsample (196411-19691V). Table 5 shows results obtained by using the
residuals v(i,n,t) and then adjusting them by dividing by the standard

deviation of output growth in that industry in the United States, as in Table

3. The results in Table 5 show that industry-specific effects, common to
nations, were also not particularly important in the last half of the 1970s.

Conclusions

A substantial fraction of changes in national aggregate industrial
production growth rates in the sample studied here can be attributed to
industry-specific disturbances that are common across nations. These are tile

types of disturbances emphasized in most real-business cycle models. But a
substantial fraction of changes in national output can also be attributed to

23

nation-specific disturbances that are common to industries (though they may
have different magnitudes of effects on different industries, as in the

results using "adjusted" data), Since it seems unlikely that productivity
shocks respect national boundaries (particularly in manufacturing, as opposed
to agriculture where the weather plays a major role), it is natural to
interpret that nation-specific disturbances as resulting from national

economic policies that are "aggregate" in the sense that they affect most or

all industries in the nation. The model in section 3 illustrates that this
is not the only interpretation; whatever factors make nations differ from
each other so that international trade is useful

also produce the results

obtained above, though it seems unlikely. The results, then, suggest that
nation-specific policy differences play a major role in fluctuations in

industrial output growth rates. This paper does not investigate what those
policies might be.

The estimated nation effects display some properties thought to

characterize aggregate output: they are highly correlated across nations,
they exhibit complicated short-run dynamic behavior, and it is not grossly
inconsistent with the evidence to characterize their changes as roughly

permanent (after some dynamics) in most of the cases. Macroeconomic models

— as

opposed to purely statistical models —

could be combined with the

approach in this paper to purge aggregate output measures of
industry-specific disturbances and to investigate the effects on national

outputs of particular macroeconomic policies. The cost of using the method
discussed in this paper is that only differences across countries in policies
can be studied, and a niulticountry sample must be employed to estimate the

24

industry effects. But there may be benefits because controlling for these
industry effects may provide, in the short time-series samples frequently
used in macroeconomic research, stronger evidence on the effects of aggregate
policies and on the interactions between aggregate fluctuations across
countries.
