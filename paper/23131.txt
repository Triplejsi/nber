Antitrust Treatment of Nonprofits: Should Hospitals Receive Special Care?
Cory Capps, Dennis W. Carlton, and Guy David
NBER Working Paper No. 23131
February 2017
JEL No. I11,L22,L31
ABSTRACT
Nonprofit hospitals receive favorable tax treatment in exchange for providing socially beneficial
activities. Extending this rationale would suggest that, insofar as suppression of competition
would allow nonprofits to cross-subsidize care for needy populations, nonprofit hospital mergers
should be evaluated differently than mergers of for-profit hospitals. However, this rationale rests
upon the premise that nonprofit hospitals with greater market power provide more care to the
needy. In this paper, we develop a theoretical model showing that the welfare implications of an
antitrust policy that favors nonprofit hospitals depends on the link between market power and
charity care provision. To test the link, we use three measures of charity care—two dollardenominated and one based on service volume—to study charity care provision by for-profit and
non-profit hospitals under different competition conditions. Using detailed California data from
2001 to 2011, we find no evidence that nonprofit hospitals are more likely than for-profit
hospitals to provide more charity care, or to offer more unprofitable services, when competition
falls. Overall, while some courts have given deference to defendants’ nonprofit status, our study
finds no empirical evidence that such hospitals provide greater charity care as they have greater
market power.

I. Introduction
Private nonprofit hospitals account for 58% of all short-term, non-federal, general hospitals,
with private for-profit hospitals accounting for 21% and government hospitals for 21%1.
Hospitals are designated as nonprofit if they do not distribute profits and are deemed to
provide sufficient public benefits such as charity care. In exchange, nonprofit hospitals
receive financial benefits, including exemptions from federal income taxes and state property
taxes. In contrast, under the antitrust laws, nonprofit hospitals typically do not receive an
analogous concession in recognition of their provision of public benefits, although some
courts in older cases used nonprofit status as a basis for lenient antitrust treatment Most
commonly, actions by nonprofit hospitals that would increase market power, such as
mergers, joint ventures, collective price setting, or other conduct such as tie-in sales, are
precluded because increased market power is presumed to harm consumers by elevating price
and reducing output. But, if nonprofit hospitals use their profits to provide public benefits,
should a nonprofit hospital be able to defend itself against an antitrust claim by arguing that
any increased market power it achieves will enable it to increase its provision of public
benefits, even if the prices to some patients rise? As noted, the tax laws do provide favorable
treatment. Should the antitrust laws, or courts in antitrust cases, do the same?
Putting aside the practically unlikely first-best solution of direct funding of care to the needy
through lump sum taxes and focusing on second-best solutions, theory is ambiguous.2 For

example, Philipson and Posner (2009) develop a model in which nonprofits maximize a
combination of profits and output. They show that a nonprofit with this objective function
will set a lower price than would a for-profit firm. However, they also show that the price
effects of an increase in market power will be greater for nonprofits. Based on this result,
they argue against special antitrust consideration for nonprofits. In contrast to their findings,
we present a model below in which, by relaxing the financing constraint, competitionreducing mergers of nonprofits can increase total welfare by increasing the provision of
charity care. In this case, the antitrust laws should not necessarily condemn competitionreducing mergers of nonprofit hospitals without an empirical examination.
Overall, economic theory indicates that a balancing of social benefits against harm from
market power may be appropriate under the assumption that nonprofits will provide greater
social benefits when they have greater market power. In this paper, we go beyond theory and
evaluate whether there is systematic empirical evidence that nonprofit hospitals do in fact
increase their provision of uncompensated care to those without insurance—the main public
benefit often claimed by nonprofits—in response to increased market power. Few papers in
the empirical literature address this question generally and, to our knowledge, no paper
studies the effect of changes in market power on the volume of uncompensated care rendered
by nonprofit hospitals. This most closely related study is Garmon (2009), which examines
the relationship between competition and the estimated dollar value of charity care provided.3

decline further and may increase.
We discuss Garmon in more detail below; as we also show below, measuring the volume of uncompensated care

2

Using 11 years of detailed data on hospital competition and several measures of charity care,
we find no empirical evidence that nonprofit hospitals increase charity care as they acquire
greater ability to do so through increased market power. We confirm our baseline
econometric results with a second, independent analysis of market power based on how the
travel times of patients change in response to changes in market power. Hospitals in litigated
merger cases have appealed to their nonprofit status as part of their defense, and with success
in some cases. Our results, however, show no significant difference in the propensities of
nonprofit and for-profit hospitals to provide more charity care as they have greater market
power. That is, we find no empirical basis for courts in merger cases to treat nonprofit
hospitals more favorably on the grounds that they may use their market power to provide
greater charity care.
We also find that, after controlling for their size, nonprofit hospitals provide only marginally
more uncompensated care than do for-profit hospitals. This finding, together with our central
result, is consistent with other studies of for-profit and nonprofit hospitals that have found
little difference in how the two organizational forms respond to financial incentives. It is
beyond the scope of this paper to question the grounds for tax exemption, but our evidence
suggests a potential role for enhanced administrative oversight of nonprofit hospitals.
Moreover, we find that controlling for size, government-run hospitals, rather than nonprofit
hospitals, provide a disproportionately high amount of uncompensated care.4 This result

directly can generate different results than measuring the volume of uncompensated care.
4

However, beyond their compelling community orientation, non-federal government hospitals have been found

to be less efficient compared to private ones (Douglas, Currie, and Simeonova 2010).

3

raises the important question of whether tax exemptions for nonprofit hospitals are a less
efficient method of funding care for the poor than providing an equivalent amount of funding
to government run hospitals. Indeed, multiple government entities have started examining
whether the public benefits of specific nonprofit hospitals justify the tax benefits they receive
and in some cases have rescinded the nonprofit status of the hospital.5
This paper is organized as follows. In section II we provide background on the application of
the antitrust laws to nonprofit firms such as hospitals and the justifications for nonprofit status.
We also discuss the theoretical and empirical literature on differences in behavior between
nonprofit and for-profit hospitals. In section III we develop a theoretical model of the effects
of competition on the behavior of nonprofit hospitals. We show that the provision of public
benefits such as uncompensated care can indeed rise when nonprofit hospitals increase their
market power and therefore, from the viewpoint of theory, it may be perfectly legitimate to
allow nonprofits to argue that an increase in their market power would benefit society by
increasing the provision of uncompensated care. In section IV, we test empirically the
theoretical proposition that increased market power leads to an increase in public benefits using

5

For example, in 2010 the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that Provena Covenant Medical Center in Urbana,
Illinois did not meet the requirements for tax exemption. The court noted that the hospital waived just 0.7%
of its revenue, far less than the tax benefits it stood to receive. The court also cited Provena’s small charity
pool: only 302 of the hospital’s 10,000 inpatient and 100,000 outpatient admissions involved charitable care
(Sataline, 2010). Separately, Senator Grassley and colleagues have introduced federal legislation that would
impose penalties on nonprofit hospitals that do not meet a minimum requirement for uncompensated care
provision ("Grassley Targets Nonprofit Hospitals on Charity Care," Wall Street Journal, December 18, 2008).
Controversy over the public benefits provided by nonprofit hospitals have continued even after the
introduction of new community benefits reporting requirements under the Affordable Care Act. (Advisory
Board, 2013; Doyle, 2014; Schencker, 2015).

data from California hospitals from 2001 to 2011 and find no evidence to support that theory.
Section V concludes the paper.

II. Background
The rationale underlying nonprofit status is that such firms presumably provide some public
benefits that for-profit firms would have little or no incentive to provide. Implicit in this
rationale is the notion that financing such benefits through tax exemptions is either more
efficient or more politically feasible than financing through direct subsidy. The provision of
those benefits could depend on a suppression of competition. For example, two food
organizations might agree to divide a city in half and serve separate halves in order to
economize on resources rather than “compete” with each other to serve meals throughout the
city. The antitrust laws would generally condemn such market allocation among for-profit
firms as a violation of the antitrust laws that prohibit conspiracy.
However, in several litigated cases, courts have allowed nonprofits to defend behavior that
would otherwise violate the antitrust laws with the argument that the public benefits of the
challenged behavior outweigh the adverse effects of lessened competition. For example, in
the MIT case, the Department of Justice sued several universities because they entered an
agreement to restrict competition for students through financial aid.6 Although the district
court found the agreement a per se violation of the antitrust laws, the appellate court reversed
the decision and ordered the district court to take explicit account of the claimed public
6

See Carlton et al. (1995) for an economic analysis of this case, U.S. v. Brown University, et al., 5F.3d 658 (3rd
Cir. 1993) (Carlton served as an expert on behalf of MIT).

benefit of the collective action (spreading a given amount of aid among more rather than
fewer poor students) as an offset to any harm from the collective agreement.7
Nonprofit status has also been an issue in multiple hospital merger cases, with merging
nonprofit hospitals consistently raising their status as a defense (Richman, 2007). Courts
have varied in their receptiveness. The most extreme case was the merger of the two largest
hospitals in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Butterworth Hospital and Blodgett Memorial Medical
Center. There, the district court held that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had
established its prima facie case that the merger would lessen competition. Nevertheless,
relying on the hospitals’ nonprofit status, the court denied the FTC’s motion for an order to
block the merger.8 In this case, the court’s logic differed from the rationale described in this
paper: rather than balancing harm from market power against the value of community
benefits (funded by that same market power), the court concluded that, because of its
nonprofit status, the merged system would not raise prices in the first place, despite the
presumed ability to do so. Similarly, in a case in Joplin, Missouri, the court cited the merging
hospitals’ nonprofit status as one of several reasons why it rejected the FTC’s merger
challenge.9

In antitrust parlance, a per se violation is one where the conduct is deemed so likely to reduce output that no
analysis of the reasonableness of the conduct is allowed, while under a rule of reason a defendant is allowed
to justify the reasonableness of his behavior through a comparison of costs and benefits. The antitrust issue
for nonprofits is whether they are allowed to use a rule of reason defense and include expanded public benefits
as part of the justification for their behavior.
FTC v. Butterworth Health, 946 F. Supp. 1285 (W.D. Mich. 1996).
FTC v. Freeman Hospital, 911 F. Supp. 1213 (W.D. Mo. 1995), aff’d, 69 F.3d 260 (8th Cir. 1995). The
court in United States v. Carilion Health System articulated a similar view. 707 F. Supp. 840 (W.D. Va.
1989), aff’d, 892 F.2d 1042 (4th Cir. 1989) (unpublished table decision).

6

Thus, there are two possible rationales for more lenient antitrust treatment of nonprofit
hospitals. The first, which courts have primarily focused on to date, is that nonprofit hospitals
would not exercise any market power they might gain. The second is that they will do so, but
in ways that are socially valuable—for example, use their enhanced market power to raise the
level of uncompensated care. The first rationale has been studied and, with the exception of
Lynk (1995), rejected. Studies have found that nonprofits do charge higher prices in more
concentrated markets (Simpson and Shin 1998; Dranove and Ludwick 1999; Keeler et al.
1999). Moreover, a number of case studies of nonprofit hospital mergers have found that
nonprofit hospitals increase price when they gain market power through merger (Vita and
Sacher, 2001; Krishnan, 2001; Haas-Wilson and Garmon, 2011; Thompson, 2011; Tenn,
2011).10
As for the second rationale, the economic literature has not made comparable progress in
addressing whether and how the provision of public benefits changes as a result of increased
market power – the focus of this paper.11 After all, the public benefits have to be paid for
somehow, and as we discuss next, higher prices to some patients is a potential mechanism to

10

11

Each study finds evidence of post-merger price increases; however, for the merger studied in Thompson
(2011), prices went up for two insurers, down for a third, and remained about the same for the fourth.
Tax exemptions and financing through tax exempt bonds for nonprofits are (or used to be) justified by a
“bargain” that was “struck between the hospital and the community: a hospital would treat patients who were
unable to pay, and the government would grant a tax exemption to the hospital” (Pellegrini, 1989). Originally
the IRS code defined charity as “relief to the poor,” but, after the introduction of Medicare and Medicaid, with
the bulk of hospital revenue coming from private insurance and public programs, the hospital industry pushed
the IRS to revise its definition of “charitable services” (Seaton and Koob, 2009). Under current federal
requirements, nonprofit hospitals are expected to provide “community benefits” in return for their 501(c)(3)
tax-exempt status. While the definition of “community benefits” is broader (Nicholson et. al., 2000), the
provision of charity care in the form of free or reduced price services remains at the heart of the justification
for nonprofit hospital tax exemptions.

7

finance them. Although the effects of competition on nonprofit hospitals’ provision of charity
care have not been closely studied, some literature examines whether nonprofit hospitals
differ in their behavior from for-profit hospitals and specifically with regard to the provision
of “community benefits” (e.g. Duggan, 2000, 2002). This literature generally shows that
nonprofits and for-profits respond similarly to financial incentives and, in at least one case,
do not differ in how they spend incremental funds on charity care.12 If there is in fact no
difference in the provision of public benefits, the entire rationale for special tax treatment for
nonprofits is suspect. There is also evidence that hospitals rely on cross-subsidies for the
provision of unprofitable services (David et al., 2014). However, the studies in this literature
typically do not control for the competitive environment and therefore do not look at whether
any differential behavior towards the provision of charity care between nonprofit and forprofit hospitals depends on market power.13
We have found only one study that empirically examines the effect of hospital competition
on the provision of public benefits by nonprofit hospitals, Garmon (2009). Using data from
Texas and Florida for 1999–2002, Garmon analyzes the effects of changes in competition on
the dollar value of charity, measured as a hospital’s cost-to-charge ratio times the sum of its
charity care and bad debt. Garmon also examines the effect of changes in competition on
hospitals’ average revenue from uninsured patients. He concludes that competition and

12

13

Sloan (2001) finds that nonprofits and for-profits provide a similar quality of care but that for-profits cost
Medicare more, ceteris paribus. Because Medicare prices are regulated, this suggests that for-profit hospitals
order more costly procedures for paying patients than nonprofit hospitals.
For example, Stensland, Gaumer, and Miller (2010) find that hospitals that face less competition and have
greater private payer revenue tend to have higher costs, which can create a misleading impression that
private payer profits subsidize unprofitable care provided to government-insured patients.

8

charity care are “if anything, positively related.” That is, Garmon finds no evidence in
support of more favorable antitrust treatment for nonprofit hospitals.
Our study explores a more direct, volume-based measure of inpatient uncompensated care
that is unlikely to be affected by differences in accounting practices across hospitals. As we
demonstrate, dollar-denominated measures of charity or uncompensated care have been
subject to rapid list price inflation and may be a poor representation of hospitals’ ability to
translate their surplus into provision of unprofitable services. We also examine whether
nonprofit hospitals expend their rents in a socially beneficial way by maintaining
unprofitable service lines, a practice that benefits all patients, not just charity care patients.
Finally, we examine 11 years of data, allowing us to capture greater variability and leverage
changes in hospitals’ market power and ownership status. This in turn allows us to rely on
the panel aspects of our data as opposed to relying primarily on cross-sectional variation.

III. Models of nonprofit objectives and constraints
Philipson and Posner (2009), develop a theory in which altruistic nonprofit producers exhibit
some degree of “output preferences;” that is, they derive utility directly from output in
addition to profits. They recognize the difference between a nonprofit’s utility and the utility
in the absence of altruism, but show that, nevertheless, competition still maximizes society’s
surplus. Based on that model, Philipson and Posner recommend an antitrust doctrine that
does not distinguish between for-profit and nonprofit actors. We show that their result

9

vanishes when nonprofits have a slightly more general objective function than the one
postulated in their paper.
The key insight that Philipson and Posner identify is that if an altruist has an output
preference, then competition among altruists, just like competition among profit-maximizing
firms, will generate the “correct” marginal pricing conditions, but only if the social welfare
function values consumption in the same way as the altruist. For example, if  represents the
additional value that the altruist attaches to everyone’s incremental health consumption, then
p = c -  is the optimal pricing condition, where p is the price and c is marginal cost. But for
this pricing condition to represent optimality, it must also be the case that such marginal
pricing will lead to financial viability for the firm. However, even in the simplest constant
returns to scale model, this cannot be true unless the altruist has funding sufficient to
subsidize the consumption of the poor (a “rich altruist”), as Philipson and Posner assume.
Conversely, if funds must come from the revenue of the nonprofit firm rather than from the
rich altruist, then it must be the case that the financing constraint will matter.14 Therefore, the
ability to exercise market power is critical ingredient the ability to provide uncompensated
care, an ingredient completely missing from the Philipson and Posner analysis.
In addition, the altruist in the Philipson and Posner model values the incremental health care
consumption of all consumers at . A slight modification is to allow the altruist to value the
health care consumption of different individuals differently. For illustration, suppose that the
altruist thinks that rich people can afford a minimal level of health care consumption, but

14

In essence, we do not allow the altruist to levy lump sum taxes on the public.

10

poor people cannot. Hence, the altruist values additional health care consumption (beyond
the minimum) of rich people at zero and that of poor people (who are below the minimum) at

.15 These two changes to the Philipson and Posner model—incorporating a financing
constraint and allowing the altruist to differentially value the health consumption of the rich
and the poor—can completely reverse their conclusion.
Our point is not that our assumptions are necessarily superior to theirs but rather that their
strong theoretical conclusion does not survive even minor changes to their model’s
assumptions. Given the sensitivity of the theoretical conclusions to the assumptions, only an
empirical analysis can resolve the issue of the proper role of nonprofit status in antitrust
analysis.
Two implications follow from our modifications. First, if the financing constraint matters (as
would be the case if the altruist is not the sole source of funds), then the creation of market
power through merger, through collective action such as coordinated price setting, or through
conduct such as tie in sales may benefit society because the elimination of competition
relaxes the financing constraint. Second, in order for market power to be exercised so as to
generate funds to subsidize uncompensated care, the nonprofit firm must be able to charge
differential prices to the rich and the poor.16 Without this ability, the transfer from the rich to
the poor could not occur. But competition makes such price discrimination difficult: with

15

16

By and large, the need to access charity care is discrete (patients either have insurance or they do not). Our
assumption can easily be relaxed and our results continue to apply as long as the altruist places a higher
marginal value on health care consumption by the poor than the rich.
While many of the uninsured are not poor, for simplicity, we use the terms “rich” and “poor” to denote the
patients that are paying above competitive rates and the patients who are benefitting from cross-subsidization.

11

differential pricing, hospitals (even nonprofits) will want to poach their rivals’ profitable
customers and this erodes the ability to exercise market power. Hence, competition-reducing
mergers can allow the merged firm to use its extra profits to subsidize the provision of public
benefits, such as uncompensated care. We now briefly describe the model and refer the
reader to Appendix A for a fuller discussion.
Suppose the altruist values additional health consumption of the poor, q2, at , and that the
cost function of a hospital that provides q1 care to the rich and q2 to the poor is given by
c(q1,q2) = F + c·(q1 + q2) where c is the marginal cost of health care and F is a fixed cost.
Assuming for simplicity that there are two hospitals owned by altruists, Bertrand competition
will produce the equilibrium p1 = c – α and p2 = c. But this equilibrium produces losses for
each firm and so is not sustainable unless each altruist has a pool of wealth that it can use to
subsidize health care. If we abandon the Philipson-Posner assumption that the altruist can
finance losses with lump sum transfers, then profits must be nonnegative, and we see that
Bertrand competition with two firms is not possible. Competition prevents the firms from
earning enough money to subsidize care for the poor.17
Suppose now that the two firms merge or form a cartel and thereby eliminate competition.
Since the firm is still altruistic, it follows that it can use its market power to raise price above
c for the rich and thereby afford to lower the price below c for the poor. In fact, if the altruist

17

With less vigorous forms of competition, such as Cournot, charity care may be provided but not in the optimal
amount. See Appendix A.

12

seeks to maximize consumer surplus (reflecting the altruist’s extra marginal valuation of
health consumption by the poor) then the altruist will choose p1 and p2 to maximize

of demand for group i. Notice how the social planner pays attention not only to the “net
mark-up” to the poor (i.e. the amount by which p2 exceeds c – α), but also to the markup on
rich individuals (i.e. the amount by which p1 exceeds c). This solution clearly shows that the
solution to the social planner’s problem cannot be achieved by Bertrand competition between
two firms even when the altruist’s preferences are the same as those of the social planner.
One could use other competitive mechanisms in place of Bertrand but the point would be the
same. When market power is needed to provide funds to finance care for the poor,
competition can be incompatible with the social optimum.

13

IV. Empirical analysis of uncompensated care, nonprofit status,
and market power
As noted above, some degree of market power is a necessary condition for the uninsured to
receive care when nonprofit hospitals face a financing constraint.18 In general, the link
between market power and uncompensated care will depend on the nonprofit hospital’s
objective function. While it is entirely possible that nonprofit hospitals will direct profits
from insured patients towards care for the uninsured, other possibilities, such as opportunistic
behavior by nonprofit administrators, the dissipation of rents through possibly inefficient
non-price competition, and various forms of regulatory evasion, are also plausible.
Accordingly, whether and to what extent nonprofit hospitals with market power use profits
from the insured to subsidize care for the uninsured is an empirical question.
We use an 11-year panel of data on California hospitals from 2001 through 2011 to study
changes in charity care provision by nonprofit, for-profit, and government hospitals as the
market concentration and competition they face varies. The analysis data set combines
financial information, including revenue, profit, and two dollar measures of uncompensated
care provision, from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development
(OSHPD) Hospital Financial Disclosure Reports with concentration measures derived from
the OSHPD Patient Discharge databases. We also use hospital discharge data to construct to

18

In practice, of course, nonprofit hospitals do receive various forms of subsidies, including in the form of tax
exemptions. Nevertheless, the point remains that, greater market power can, depending on their objective
functions, allow nonprofit hospitals to provide greater amounts of uncompensated care.

14

directly measure uncompensated care based on the volume of inpatient care provided to
uninsured patients.

IV.A. Measuring uncompensated care
Both for-profit and nonprofit hospitals provide substantial amounts of uncompensated care
(CBO, 2006). Uncompensated care is the most prominent form of reported community
benefit; other categories include medical education and training, research, and community
programs.19 Uncompensated care accounts for 56% of total community benefits reported by
nonprofit hospitals, and the average and median percentages of revenue devoted to
uncompensated care were 7% and 4% (IRS, 2009). These measures, however, are subject to
manipulation; for example, the IRS study finds a great deal of variation in how hospitals
measure and report uncompensated care.20
In California, for-profit hospitals accounted for more than 20% of all uncompensated care.
Like their nonprofit counterparts, for-profit hospitals are legally required to treat patients
who require immediate medical attention, regardless of their ability to pay, and also may treat

19

20

Education and training account for 23% of reported community benefits, medical research accounts for 15%,
and community programs account for 6% (IRS, 2009). Young et al. (2015) provide a more recent examination
of community benefits provided by nonprofit hospitals. They report that about 85% of community benefit
expenditures are related to direct patient care (25% for charity care, 15% for subsidized health services, and
45% for unreimbursed costs under non-Medicare government programs).
The IRS study reports that roughly one-fifth of hospitals include as uncompensated care each of the following:
“the difference between hospital charges and the amount private insurance paid or allowed for services
(private insurance shortfalls); the difference between hospital charges and the amount Medicare paid or
allowed for services (Medicare shortfalls); the difference between hospital charges and the amount Medicaid
allowed for services (Medicaid shortfalls); and the difference between hospital charges and the amount other
public insurance programs allowed for services (other public program shortfalls).” Some of these measures
appear suspect. For example, including “private insurance shortfalls” in uncompensated care is subject to
ready manipulation: a hospital could increase its list charges, offer managed care organizations
correspondingly larger discounts, and thereby report higher levels of uncompensated care.

15

patients who subsequently turn out either to lack insurance or to fail to pay the out-of-pocket
portion of their medical bill. When the hospital approves in advance free or discounted care,
such care is considered charity care, and will likely appear in a hospital’s financial data as a
deduction from revenue under the category of “charity care.” In many cases, a hospital may
learn after the fact that the care it provided was partially or entirely uncompensated. This is
also accounted for as a deduction from revenue (similar to the accounting treatment of
contractual discounts), but is commonly allocated to “bad debt.”21 In practice, the majority of
uncompensated care in California is reported as bad debt rather than as charity care.
Generally, hospitals and hospital systems vary in how they allocate uncompensated care into
charity care and bad debt. As a result, uncompensated care, defined as the sum of charity care
and bad debt, is likely the more reliable dollar-denominated measure of community benefits
(CBO, 2006; David and Helmchen, 2006; Garmon, 2009). In the analysis below, we focus
both on reported charity care and uncompensated care (defined as charity care + bad debt),
but place more focus on the sum.
The value of uncompensated care reported in hospitals’ financial statements may overstate
both its market value and its cost. Some hospitals compute charity care and bad debt using
the list prices for services as reflected in their chargemasters, which are lengthy menus of
somewhat arbitrary list prices (Reinhardt, 2006; IRS, 2009). However, in practice, hospitals
rarely if ever receive payment equal to their list charges. Private insurers commonly negotiate
discounts under which actual payments may be 40-60% of list prices. Medicare payments are

typically below private rates, and Medicaid rates are usually lower still. The uninsured are
often billed full list charges, but they rarely actually pay those bills, which will be reflected in
high levels of bad debt.
This method of valuation is likely to lead to biased estimates of charity care provision when
inflation of and discounting from list charges are not constant across hospitals. For example,
hospitals that provide the same volume of free care but have higher list charges may appear
to provide more uncompensated care than hospitals with lower list charges provide.22 Crosssectionally, the bias would be particularly severe if hospitals with more market power have a
greater ability or propensity to inflate their list charges. Such tendencies, to the extent that
they are time-invariant, are diminished by the inclusion of hospital fixed-effects in the
econometric analysis. Nevertheless, the concern remains that the within-hospital comovement of charity volume and list charges is responsive to the dynamics of competition.
For example, hospitals in markets experiencing consolidation may use their market power to
raise list and transaction prices without allocating more resources to enhancing the volume
and type of uncompensated care provided.
To avoid these issues and focus on actual services rendered to the poor, we construct a third
measure of charity care: the volume of inpatient services provided to uninsured patients.
Each year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) computes and publishes
DRG “weights.” From 2001 to 2011, the set of inpatient services hospitals offer were divided
into roughly 550 Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs). CMS determines weights for each DRG

22

Garmon (2009) accounts for this by deflating list charges by each hospital’s cost-to-charge ratio.

17

based upon regular surveys of hospitals’ costs. The weights reflect the relative cost of
treating patients in a particular DRG. For example, a patient in a DRG with a weight of 4 is
four times as costly on average to treat as a patient in a DRG with a weight of 1. The volume
based measure of care provided to various sets of patients that we analyzed below (e.g.,
Medicare, Medicaid, privately insured, uninsured, etc.) is computed as the sum of the DRG
weights for all patients in a given payer class.
In summary, the three measures we examine are (1) “charity care”—the reported dollars of
charity care; (2) “uncompensated care”—the sum of reported dollars of charity care and
uncompensated care; and (3) “charity volume”—total inpatient services volume provided to
patients without insurance. The first two span all services offered by hospitals, including
outpatient and inpatient, but are subject to the limitations described above. The third is more
accurately measured and is our preferred measure, though it only captures inpatient care.
In 2008, CMS introduced changes to its DRG system to account for severity (Medicare
Severity-DRG, or MS-DRG) that resulted in a complete restructuring of the taxonomy,
including an expansion from 538 DRGs to 745 MS-DRGs. The change from DRG to MSDRG “weights” has little effect on our charity care provision analysis because those
“weights” are aggregated yearly by payer category.

Figure 2 presents histograms for the three charity measures. Since, all else equal, larger
hospitals are expected to provide higher nominal and actual rates of charity care, measures of

18

charity are divided by the number of staffed beds for each hospital. Charity measures,
adjusted for size, appear to follow a log normal distribution.
Figure 3 presents statewide yearly trends in total charity care, bad debt, and charity volume.
Both charity care and bad debt (and thus, the sum of charity care and bad debt) more than
tripled between 2001 and 2011. Charity volume, on the other hand, grew by just half over the
same period.23 This suggests that the growth in charity care and uncompensated care is
driven by increases in both charges and patient volume, but more so the former.24

IV.B. Measuring competition
We use a measure of competition that does not require specifying any geographic market or
market boundaries (this measure is similar to that used in Kessler and McClellan (2000)).25
Our competition measure is constructed as follows. In the first step, we calculate the standard
HHI based on observed shares of commercially-insured patients within each unique zip code
and Major Diagnostic Category (MDC) combination (a “micromarket”), taking joint

23

24

25

Over this same period, the under-65 population of California grew by 8.9%, from 31.2 million to 33.0 million;
the size of that group that is uninsured rose slightly to approximately 6.9 million
(http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/hlthins/historic/hihistt6.xls). The increase in measured charity volume
exceeds the growth in the uninsured population.
Nonprofits cannot distribute their profits. However, if profits from excess pricing are dissipated through higher
compensation and staff perquisites, a hospital’s costs will increase and so will its cost-to-charge ratio. Even
holding the actual volume of uncompensated care fixed, this could misleadingly increase the dollardenominated value of uncompensated care. Another factor that could drive greater increases in the dollardenominated measures is that, over time, more services have shifted to the outpatient setting and the charity
volume measure only reflects inpatient services. This is unlikely to account for a significant portion of the
widening gap because statewide inpatient discharges increased steadily over the sample period.
Imposing arbitrary market definitions, such as counties, health service areas (HSAs), or metropolitan statistical
areas (MSAs), may overstate or understate the true size of the market and generate spurious conclusions about
the degree of competition faced by specific hospitals, or produce a measure of concentration that has so much
measurement error that it would be challenging to identify any relationship between concentration, market
power, and charity care.

19

ownership into account.26 All hospitals that treat patients in a given MDC-zip code pair are
part of this HHI calculation, so we do not impose any market boundaries (except insofar as
we use data only from the State of California). In the second step, we compute a hospitalspecific HHI for each hospital as the weighted sum of micromarket HHIs, where the weight
is the share of that hospital's patients that originate from each zip code-MDC combination.27
In general, hospitals that draw patients from more concentrated zip codes and more
concentrated service lines will have higher hospital-level HHIs. The higher a hospital’s HHI,
the weaker is the competitive pressure that it faces. Therefore, not surprisingly, a number of
studies have demonstrated that this modified HHI is a good predictor of hospital prices,
supporting its use to measure hospitals’ and systems’ market power (Gruber, 1994; Keeler,
Melnick, and Zwanzinger, 1999; Dranove and Ludwick, 1999; Capps and Dranove 2004).28

26

27

28

Because we focus on acute care hospitals, for the purpose of measuring competition, we exclude MDCs 19
(psychiatric care) and 20 (alcohol and drug related admissions), which are also provided by standalone
psychiatric hospitals and addiction treatment centers, respectively. Additionally, these services are used
disproportionately by the uninsured population and are considered unprofitable; therefore, they are not likely
to contribute to or reflect the formation of market power. In order to avoid double-counting labor and delivery
admissions, we also exclude DRG 391, the DRG for a normal newborn.
Our data for the three measures end in 2011 because the five-digit zip codes needed to match demographic
information to corresponding MDC-zip combination are available from California OSHPD only before
2011. In this paper, we only present results that use hospital-specific HHI calculated without hospitals of
Kaiser Permanente. The exclusion of Kaiser hospitals is because Kaiser hospitals compete only indirectly
with the hospitals we study (Ho and Lee (2013)), whereas our hospital-specific HHIs intend to capture the
levels of direct hospital competition. For robustness check, we conduct a set of analysis using hospitalspecific HHI calculated with Kaiser hospitals. Our main results are robust to the inclusion of Kaiser.
Kessler and McClellan (2000) noted, correctly, that this competition measure is likely endogenous and
proposed constructing the hospital-level HHIs using the predicted values from a discrete choice model that
includes only exogenous right hand side variables (rather than observed market shares) to compute the HHI
in each micromarket. In practice, estimating 11 years of logit models for the state of California is impractical
and, as we show below, the simpler measure based on observed micromarket shares is an effective predictor
of hospital pricing.

20

Formally, the measure of the degree of competition faced by hospital j, Hosp-HHIj, is defined
as follows:

(2)

Z M
 Hosp. j's patients from zip z and MDC m 
Hosp-HHI j   
  HHI z ,m  .
Hosp. j's total patients
z 1 m 1 


HHI z , m is the typical HHI, computed as the sum of squared market shares among patients

from zip code z with a diagnosis in MDC m.
Using this measure of competition addresses the problems raised by pre-specifying a
geographic market within which to measure competition. However, the Hosp-HHI may still
be subject to endogeneity (e.g., hospitals’ prices determine their market share and thus the
HHI, and prices may also affect the provision of charity care). Kessler and McClellan address
this issue by substituting for the observed shares within each microsegment the predicted
shares from a choice model that uses only exogenous factors (e.g., distance and age) as
predictors. This approach is less practical in the current setting because, while Kessler and
McClellan compute their concentration measures for heart attack admissions only, we study
all acute care inpatient admissions.29
We view the concern as minimal. Due to the presence of insurance, the majority of the
hospital population faces no variation or very modest variation in prices across in-network
hospitals (the same is true of the uninsured, who typically do not pay their inpatient hospital

29

Compared to the data in Kessler and McClellan, our data encompass roughly 20 times as many patients per
year and span 11 years rather than four.

21

bills). As a result, market shares and HHIs will be affected by prices only to the extent that
variation of such prices in our data determine whether hospitals are included in or excluded
from insurers’ networks.
This distinction was discussed in detail in Vistnes (2000), who described hospital
competition as a “two stage” process. In the first stage, hospitals and insurers negotiate
pricing and determine network structure. In the second stage, hospitals compete for patients
primarily on the basis of non-price factors. Most hospitals have at least some excess capacity
and would find it profitable at the margin to enter agreements with as many insurers as
possible. This explains why, in practice, most managed care networks, at least until recently,
include most hospitals.30 Price, therefore, serves primarily to divide the gains from trade
between hospitals and insurers (and insurers’ customers). The direct effect of price on
patients’ choices among in-network hospitals is minimal, so we do not think endogeneity
poses a problem in this context. We also explore a sensitivity analysis that replaces the allpatient hospital-HHIs with the hospital-HHIs derived from just enrollees in traditional
Medicare. The hospitalization decisions of Medicare enrollees are unlikely to be affected by
network restrictions (virtually all hospitals accept Medicare), pricing, or market power
(Medicare prices are regulated).

30

This was less true in the 1990s, when HMOs were both more common than PPOs and tended to feature
narrower networks. By the end of the 1990s, consumers had largely rejected narrow networks, and HMOs
began offering broader networks (which PPOs had always offered). See Draper et al. (2002) and Ginsberg
(2005). The appendix in Capps, Dranove, and Satterthwaite (2003) contains a stylized proof showing that
insurers have an incentive to assemble expansive hospitals networks. Narrower networks have become
somewhat more common in recent years, but that trend was in the very early stages as of 2011, the final year
of our data.

IV.C. Data overview
Table 1 presents summary statistics describing the time path of the number of hospitals, beds,
utilization, financial information, and charity care provision from 2001–2011, separately for
nonprofit, for-profit, and government hospitals. Over the sample period, the number of
nonprofit hospitals declined by 7.5% and the number of for-profit hospitals declined by
14.6%. The bulk of this decline occurred after 2003 and was likely related to requirements
that hospitals complete seismic retrofitting by 2006 (some hospitals closed or converted to
other uses rather than retrofit; Chang and Jacobson, 2008). Average net income among forprofit hospitals also began a marked decline in 2004. Average net income among nonprofit
hospitals, however, increased steadily over the sample period. With the economic recovery
following the 2008 financial crisis and recession, however, net income for hospitals of all
types had improved by 2011.31
Average discharges at the surviving hospitals increased over time, as expected given
population growth and hospital closures. The average number of beds increased only slightly
between 2001-2011 since exiting hospitals were smaller than average, and then evened out or
declined. Consequently, growth in discharges per hospital was primarily the result of higher
utilization of existing beds rather than the addition of new beds.32

31

32

California also began Medicaid expansion under a federal waiver in November, 2010, which may have
contributed to improved net income in 2011 (Harbage and King, 2012).
The average exiting hospital had 101.6 beds while the average surviving hospital (i.e. hospitals appearing in
every year of our sample) had 194.2 beds.

23

The middle three rows in each panel contain the annual averages of the three measures of
charity care: reported charity care, uncompensated care (charity care plus bad debt), and the
volume measure of charity care.33 At nonprofit hospitals, all three measures grew rapidly
over the sample period. Notably, as indicated in Figure 3, the volume-based measure of
charity care grew at a much slower rate than either of the two dollar-based measures of
charity care. This suggests that some portion of the increase in measured charity care reflects
factors other than increasing levels of uncompensated inpatient care. As discussed above, this
could result from increases in list charges, decreases in reimbursement for some types of
insured patients, or accounting practices that incorporate expenditures not directly related to
patient care, such as medical research and teaching, into the reported charity care measures.
Government hospitals reported growing levels of charity care and bad debt, but did not
provide an increasing volume of inpatient care to the uninsured and indigent (as we show
below, however, the level of inpatient care that government hospitals provide to the
uninsured was high relative to their scale and revenue and remained so).
Figure 4 charts average trends by ownership type for each of the three measures of charity
provision. The left panel reports raw means while the right hand-side panel tracks measures
of intensity by dividing each charity measure by the number of staffed beds and averaging it
across hospitals within ownership type. Nonprofits saw a sharp increase in all three charity
measures over the 2001–2011 period. For-profit hospitals did as well, but the increase was

24

smaller, particularly for the dollar-denominated measures. On a per bed basis, increases in
charity care and uncompensated care are similar for all three categories of hospitals. The
pattern is different for the volume-based measure. Government hospitals did not increase
charity volume, either on an overall or per bed basis. But they consistently provided a much
higher level of charity volume than for-profit and nonprofit hospitals. The average nonprofit
hospital provided more charity volume than the average for-profit hospital, but the bulk of
this difference is attributable to the larger average size of nonprofit hospitals—the per bed
charity volume measures are much more similar for the two types of hospitals than the per
hospital volume measures.
Summary statistics for scale measures, concentration, and the three charity measures are
presented in Table 2. Three Hospital-HHI measures are also summarized: the first is derived
from the full sample of patients, the second is based only on privately insured patients, and
the third is calculated based only on Medicare patients. Our primary analysis relies on the
first measure; the sensitivity analysis presented below discusses reasons for considering these
alternative measures and establishes that our results are robust to alternative ways of
measuring concentration.
The final column in Table 2 shows that over the full sample period, nonprofit hospitals
actually account for a disproportionately low share of total charity care provision, particularly
when that care is measured by volume rather than dollars. Despite accounting for 65% of
beds, 67% of discharges, and 71% of revenue, nonprofit hospitals account for only 64% of
charity care and bad debt and only 55% of the total volume of inpatient service provided to

25

the uninsured. Perhaps surprisingly, for-profit hospitals actually account for a
disproportionately large amount of charity care measured in dollars, though the same is not
true for the volume measure. Relative to their overall scale, government hospitals provide a
particularly large volume of inpatient care to the uninsured—almost one-third of the total
volume of care provided to the uninsured is provided by government hospitals.34 They
account for 34% of charity volume even though they account for only 16% of patient beds,
15% of discharges, and 15% of patient revenue.
As suggested by the theoretical section above, the disproportionately low level of charity care
provided by nonprofit hospitals could be the result of competitive pressures that preclude
charging prices to insured patients that are sufficiently high to facilitate cross-subsidizing
uncompensated care. However, Table 2 also shows that nonprofit hospitals on average face
less competition than for-profit hospitals. Moreover, while the degree of competition faced
by for-profit hospitals has increased slightly over time (the average hospital-HHI for forprofits fell from 3,123 in 2001 to 2,939 in 2011), the degree of competition faced by
nonprofit hospitals remained roughly unchanged over the sample period.

IV.D. Results
The basic regression model posits that charity care measure m is a function of the degree of
competition faced by a hospital and of other potential control variables Wj,t such as patient

34

Consistent with this evidence that government hospitals are more focused on providing care to the needy,
CBO (2006) reports that, for government hospitals, uncompensated care accounts for 13% of operating
expenses, as compared to 4.7 percent at nonprofit hospitals and 4.2 percent at for-profit hospitals.

mix (e.g., uninsured patients living near a given hospital) or local demographics (e.g.,
income, urban/rural area):

Ln(Charity )(jm,t )  Type ( j )   j  Type ( j ) Hospital _ HHI j ,t   W j ,t  Dt   jt .

The first term, Type ( j ) , is a constant that is specific to each ownership type and  j is a set of
hospital fixed effects. The coefficient on the measure of market power,  Type ( j ) , captures the
extent to which hospitals with more market power provide more (or less) charity care. To
identify potentially differing propensities to provide more charity care for a given level of
market power, we allow the coefficient on the concentration measure to vary according to the
ownership type of hospital j. That is, Type ( j )   NFP   FP *1[ FPj  1]   Govt *1[Govt j  1] .35
The test of whether, relative to for-profit hospitals, nonprofit hospitals provide more charity
care as they face less competition reduces to a test of whether  FP  0 . That will be our key
test for whether the antitrust laws should provide special consideration to nonprofit hospitals.
In addition, our specification allows us to test whether, all else equal, nonprofits provide
more charity care than for-profits. This is a test for whether the tax exemptions enjoyed by
nonprofit hospitals are justified by their provision of uncompensated care. This amounts to a
test of whether  FP  0. 36

Type ( j ) .

Strictly speaking, the special case where FP< 0 and FP<0, would indicate that, on average, nonprofit hospitals
provide less uncompensated care than other hospital types but, also on average, provide more uncompensated

27

We explore two sets of models in the baseline analysis. The first is a set of cross-sectional
and fixed effect models, presented in Table 3, which are robust to correlations between
unobserved time-invariant hospital-specific factors and the error term. However, to the extent
that the provision of charity care is related to time-invariant (or largely so) hospital
characteristics (e.g., teaching status, scale, unobservable factors) or factors that are not
available on an annual basis (e.g., income of the surrounding area), fixed effects regressions
cannot identify potentially important determinants of the provision of charity care. We also
perform a set of cross-sectional regressions that include a wider set of hospital and area
characteristics (presented in Table 4). Robust standard errors are used in all analyses to
account for heteroscedasticity. In addition, in fixed effect models, we cluster the standard
errors at the Hospital Referral Region (HRR) level to account for potential correlated
standard errors within HRRs.37
The hospital characteristics included in the full controls specifications include ownership
type, teaching status, discharges, and an indicator for rural hospitals. Area characteristics are
computed at the hospital service area (HSA) level and include the median income in each
HSA, the 18-65 population, total population, the poverty rate, and the percentages of
hospitalized residents that lack insurance and that have private insurance.38 The variables

37

38

care when their market power increases. This case is more nuanced, as it support differential treatment under
the tax code and the antitrust law. Here, we find no evidence that FP< 0, so the average level of uncompensated
care provision by nonprofits and for-profits is examined solely by focusing on the sign of FP.
HRRs represent regional health care markets for tertiary medical care that generally requires the services of a
major referral center. Using this level of aggregation reduces the number of clusters and is therefore would
make inference more conservative.
HSAs are defined by the Dartmouth Atlas Project and are computed as collections of zip codes “whose
residents receive most of their hospitalizations from the hospitals in that area.” See
http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/faq/data.shtm. For demographic data from the Census, HSA averages are

28

describing the payer mix within each HSA are derived from the hospital discharge data and
so vary over time; accordingly, these are included in both sets of models.
Our cross-sectional results are presented in the upper panel of Table 3.39 In the model without
ownership interactions, the coefficient estimates on hospital-HHI are positive and statistically
significant for all charity measures, indicating that each rises with concentration. Adding
ownership interactions reveals our key finding, namely that there is no statistically significant
positive difference between nonprofit and for-profit hospitals in terms of the relationship
between concentration and charity care, uncompensated care, or charity volume. (top panel
of Table 3, row 2.) If anything, for-profit hospitals on average provide more uncompensated
care than nonprofit hospitals as they face less competition (this is evident only for the dollardenominated uncompensated care measure). Government hospitals provide less charity
volume in more concentrated markets, but higher levels of charity and uncompensated care.
Especially since charity volume is our preferred measure of charity care, the lower provision
of charity volume by government hospitals when concentration increases is a surprising
finding that we leave for future research.
When hospital fixed-effects are included (lower panel of Table 3) the statistical significance
of the baseline relationship between the two dollar-denominated measures of charity care and
concentration disappears. Charity volume is not higher in more concentrated markets in all
specifications. Importantly, just as before, there is no evidence that the positive effect of

calculated as population-weighted averages of the zip code level means. There are 215 HSAs in California
that contain hospitals.
39
The cross-sectional results are robust to clustering at HRR level.

29

market power is greater for nonprofit hospitals than for for-profit hospitals on the provision
of charity. (bottom panel of Table 3, row 2—none of the coefficients are negative and
significant). Overall, the results in Table 3 show no empirical support for the proposition that
nonprofit hospitals use greater market power to provide greater public benefits. Thus, we find
no evidence to support special treatment for nonprofit hospitals under the antitrust laws.
An intermediate case between the upper and lower panels of Table 3 is presented in Table 4,
where instead of including hospital fixed effects, the regression is saturated with hospitallevel and market-level characteristics.40 As in the less saturated cross-sectional specifications,
there is a statistically significant positive relationship between concentration and charity
volume. But there is, again, no statistically significant difference in the effect of
concentration on the provision of charity care between for-profit and nonprofit hospitals (see
the second row in Table 4).41, 42
In terms of the level of charity volume, when compared to nonprofit hospitals and controlling
for size and market concentration, for-profit hospitals provide lower charity volume on
average, though the difference is not statistically significant.43 This finding calls into question

40

41

42

43

In Table 4, column (7)-(9), we regress the three charity care measures using full specification but exclude
rural hospital from the sample. Rural hospitals usually have high HHIs, but not necessarily high bargaining
leverage because insurers don't have a strong incentive to sell in the more rural areas. We exclude those rural
high HHI data points and find our results reported below are the same as using full sample.
As in Table 3, Table 4 shows that government hospitals’ charity volume is either less sensitive to or negatively
related to the degree of competition faced by the hospital. That is, government hospitals appear to provide less
charity care in more concentrated markets. This is a surprising result that we leave for future research.
As in the upper panel of Table 3, results in Table 4 are robust to clustering HRR level.
The difference is statistically significant in one specification for uncompensated care, which is the sum of
charity care and bad debt. This indicates that the provision of uncompensated care rises with concentration
more for the for-profit hospitals than the nonprofits. As we note above, dollar measures of charity care will
be inflated by higher list prices and also depend on idiosyncrasies in hospital's accounting practices.

30

the special treatment that nonprofit hospitals receive under the tax code. Government
hospitals provide substantially higher charity volume (columns (3) (6) and (9) in row 5 of
Table 4) than both nonprofit and for-profit hospitals and the differences are statistically
significant, even though they report lower levels of charity care and uncompensated care on
average.
Other coefficients have reasonable signs. For example, the results in Table 4 show that
teaching hospitals provide statistically significantly more charity volume than nonteaching
hospitals. Rural hospitals have higher levels of charity and uncompensated care (after
controlling for size), but provide less charity volume.44 Charity volume rises as median
income falls and as the percent uninsured rises. These findings all seem reasonable to us and
give us confidence in our results.
As highlighted in the theoretical model, the first step in a cross-subsidization mechanism is
price increases to individuals with private insurance. To evaluate this mechanism, and as a
basic check of the reasonableness of the market power measure, we replace our dependent
variable from Table 4 with price measures. We analyze two price measures of what insured
individuals are charged: (1) an overall severity-adjusted price and (2) a price index based on
conditions (DRGs) treated at a broad set of hospitals. The results are presented in Table 5.

44

As expected, larger hospitals have higher levels of uncompensated care and charity volume but, as evidenced
by the coefficient on the log of total discharges being close to 1, the effect is roughly proportional to scale.
The coefficient on discharges is very close to 1 based for the charity volume measure and is further above 1
for the other two measures.

31

We find that our concentration measure (Hosp-HHI) is positively related to prices, and the
relationship is robust when hospital fixed effects are included.45

IV.E. Provision of unprofitable services
Nonprofit hospitals could use their profits to provide services that are unprofitable, even if
those services are not disproportionately provided to uninsured patients. As noted above,
hospital services commonly cited as unprofitable include psychiatric care, rehabilitation, the
emergency department, trauma services, burn care, and labor and delivery (McClellan, 1997;
Horwitz and Nichols, 2009; Lindrooth et al., 2010). Offer rates for these services by
ownership type are presented in Table 6. It is clear from this table that nonprofit and
government hospitals are the most common providers of these services. However, as shown
in the pattern of results from probit models relating the probability of a hospital offering each
of these services to concentration and ownership type (see Table 7), nonprofits are no more
likely to offer these services as concentration increases than are for-profit hospitals. These
services are generally more likely to be provided by hospitals in more concentrated markets,
but this is not confined to nonprofit hospitals. And, for two services—trauma care and burn
care—the effect of concentration on the probability of providing these unprofitable or less
profitable services is stronger for for-profit hospitals and the effect is statistically significant.

45

For details on the construction of the price indexes, see Appendix C in online appendix.

32

IV.F. Sensitivity analyses
One potential concern is that the measure of competition, the Hosp-HHI, may be
endogenous. Kessler and McClellan (2000) noted, correctly, that this competition measure is
likely endogenous and proposed constructing the hospital-level HHIs using the predicted
values from a discrete choice model that includes only exogenous right hand side variables
(rather than observed market shares) to compute the HHI in each micromarket. As noted
above, this is impractical in the current analysis. As an alternative approach, we construct a
version of the Hosp-HHI that is based solely on patients covered by Traditional Medicare
(i.e., Fee-for-service Medicare). Medicare patients have essentially unfettered choice of
hospitals and, because Medicare pays rates that are set administratively, Medicare patients
also face little if any price variation across hospitals. Therefore, hospitals’ shares among
Medicare patients are very unlikely to be affected by hospital market power or pricing.46 As
shown in Appendix B1-B3. The results under this alternative measure of concentration are
very similar to those under the baseline concentration measure.47

46

47

However, hospitals’ shares of Medicare patents in certain microsegments (e.g., obstetrics) is an imperfect
proxy for the preferences of privately insured patients.
Potential omitted variables, such as unobserved hospital quality, raise concerns with regard to obtaining
unbiased estimates of FP. If patients can observe changes in quality (even to a limited extent), hospitals with
increasing quality are likely to attract more insured and uninsured patients, resulting in both greater market
share and more uncompensated care. Therefore, not controlling for hospital quality could result in a bias
towards finding a positive relationship between market power and uncompensated care, even when using
hospital fixed effects. Similarly, consolidation that results in fewer hospitals would lead to an increase in the
number of uninsured patients seen by all hospitals, especially those patients that require emergency care. This
somewhat mechanical effect would again suggest finding a positive correlation between market concentration
and uncompensated care. However, we find little or no evidence of such an effect. Moreover, since we are
interested in whether the relationship varies by type of ownership, it is not obvious that our estimate of such
variation would be biased even if quality is endogenous.

33

We also considered the possibility that some service lines may be intrinsically unprofitable
and also highly concentrated, in which case the apparent “concentration” may in fact be the
provision of a community benefit. As a first note, our analysis focuses on acute inpatient care
and so our concentration measure excludes two services, psychiatric care and rehabilitation,
often cited as unprofitable.48 The acute care service lines most often cited as unprofitable
include trauma care, burn care, the emergency department, neonatology, and, to a lesser
extent, labor and delivery.49 Even among these services, however, privately insured patients
are likely to be profitable. To explore whether we may be conflating concentration in
unprofitable service lines with market power, we also estimate versions of the same models
using the Hosp-HHI as constructed only from privately insured patients. The results are very
similar to those under the baseline concentration measure and the Medicare-derived
measure.50 (We revisit unprofitable services below.)
Finally, we also considered the possibility that the results are driven primarily by crosssectional variation rather than within-hospital variation over time. To address this, we
estimate the model using only hospitals that are in the bottom and top 25% of the distribution
of changes in the Hosp-HHI from the beginning to the end of the sample.51 As shown in
Table 8, the results under this restricted sample support our previous finding that nonprofit

See McClellan (1997), Horwitz and Nichols (2009), and Lindrooth et al. (2010).
Note that visits to the emergency department (ED) are not recorded as inpatient care; only an ED patient who
stays overnight would, typically, be admitted to the hospital and treated as an inpatient admission.
These tables are omitted but are available upon request.
25% of hospitals had a decrease in the Hosp-HHI of 237 or more and 25% of hospitals had an increase in the
HHI of more than 108. The former would correspond to a firm with a share of roughly 22% splitting into two
firms; the latter would correspond to a merger of two firms with shares of roughly 7% each.

hospitals do not provide statistically significantly more charity care, uncompensated care, or
charity volume (relative to for-profit hospitals) as they face less competition. One distinction
is that, based on the “large HHI change” restricted sample, concentration is negatively and
significantly related to uncompensated care, whereas there is no significant relationship in
the full sample analysis. This suggests that the estimated insignificant relationship reported
earlier between concentration and uncompensated care in the full sample is primarily driven
by cross-sectional rather than time series variation. Although, on the other hand, the
relationship between concentration and charity volume stays positive and significant under
all specifications in both the full and restricted samples, we are skeptical that increases in
concentration will generally result in greater provision of charity care for either nonprofit or
for-profit hospitals given the mixed results across different charity care provision measures.
Moreover, there is no evidence, in these or prior specifications, that charity care provision by
nonprofit hospitals is more responsive to reductions in competition than provision by forprofit hospitals.
As a final, distinct check of our basic result that nonprofits do not increase charity volume as
they face less competition, we examine changes in the travel patterns of insured and
uninsured patients to hospitals that were in the top 25% of changes in the hospital-HHI. For
these hospitals, the average travel time of privately insured patients increased by roughly
16% from 2001 to 2007 (from about 20.5 minutes in 2001 to 24 minutes in 2007). This
indicates that hospitals that gained market power drew insured patients from a broader area
(as opposed to business stealing from nearby rivals). However, there was no corresponding

35

increase in the average travel time of uninsured patients, which remained at 23.5 minutes.52
That increased market power does not lead to a hospital drawing uninsured patients from a
broader area suggests that there is a relatively fixed volume of uninsured patients that
hospitals tend to accept, irrespective of their market power.

V. Conclusion
Our theoretical model suggests that the welfare implications of less competition among
nonprofit hospitals will depend on the link between market power and the provision of
uncompensated care. In particular, we show that cross-subsidization facilitated by market
power may, theoretically, increase welfare. If the underlying premise that nonprofit hospitals
use profits from private paying patients to fund care for the uninsured were borne out
empirically, that could indicate a fundamental inconsistency between the tax laws, which
offer nonprofits favorable treatment in exchange for community benefits, and the antitrust
laws, which do not generally provide favorable treatment in recognition of community
benefits.53
Our analysis of 2001–2011 data on competition, ownership status, and charity care provision
by California hospitals offers no support for according any special antitrust treatment to
nonprofit hospitals. We find no evidence that nonprofit hospitals are more likely than for-

52

53

Similar findings emerge when looking at the upper tail of the travel time distribution. For example the 90th
percentile of travel time increased by 27% (from 41.2 to 52.3 minutes) for privately insured patients and by
less than 2% for the uninsured (from 48 to 48.9 minutes).
As noted above, some courts have credited merging hospitals’ nonprofit status, but on the expectation that a
nonprofit would not raise price in the first place rather than on the expectation that the nonprofit would raise
price and use the resulting profits to provide care to the uninsured.

36

profit hospitals to provide more charity care in response to an increase in market power. We
also test whether nonprofit hospitals facing less competition are more likely to offer
unprofitable services and again find no significant differences between nonprofit and forprofit hospitals. Our results therefore provide no empirical justification for applying a
different antitrust standard to nonprofit hospitals than to for-profit hospitals.
Our results also allow us to test whether nonprofit hospitals provide more charity care than
for-profit hospitals, adjusting for the level of competition. We find no empirical support for
this proposition either. Examining the efficacy of the nonprofit tax exemption at promoting
charity care is beyond the scope of this paper, but our evidence suggests a potential role for
enhanced administrative oversight of nonprofit hospitals.

Appendix A:
Welfare analysis for the case of linear demand curves
We now present an example to illustrate how a merger of nonprofit hospitals can increase social welfare by
suppressing competition. Following our analysis above, suppose that a hospital monopolist produces a
single service at a total cost of c ( q ) = F + cq , and that it is able to divide the aggregate demand into two
groups: rich patients (Market 1) and poor patients (Market 2). These two groups have two distinct
downward-sloping demand curves for hospital services, the demand curves are known to the monopolist,
and there is no opportunity for arbitrage between groups, as medical care is “non-tradable” from the
patient prospective. To illustrate our point simply, we assume that under uniform pricing Market 2 is not
served profitably when price is set at marginal cost. This is important for our example because when
demand curves are linear, price discrimination results in lower welfare and uniform price is favored
(Schmalensee, 1981). In our model however, since the poor are excluded under a uniform price, the
welfare implications of price discrimination are ambiguous.
The monopolist chooses a price for each group. Let { P1 , P2 } denote the prices in Market 1 and Market 2
respectively. Assume that the demand curve in Market i is qi = ai − bi Pi . Serving Market i is profitable if
Pi > c , or ai > c ⋅ bi for i = 1, 2 . If this condition is violated a for-profit monopoly will not engage in price
discrimination. Instead, it will choose a uniform price (i.e. set price in both markets equal to the monopoly
price for rich patients). Such pricing behavior excludes poor patients from receiving services. On the other
hand, a nonprofit monopoly may serve markets in which this condition is violated. By relying on other
segments of the population for whom they can price above cost (Market 1), the nonprofit firm will price
below cost in Market 2 without violating its non-distribution constraint, which applies to the organization
as a whole.
Under the assumption that cb2 − a2 > 0 a for-profit monopoly will always choose to exclude the poor
( q2F = 0 ). On the other hand, a sufficient condition for a nonprofit monopoly to serve the poor is the
ability to set P1 above c . The monopoly will supply services to the poor even in the extreme case, where
the social value of serving the poor (for every level of quantity) is lower than the social cost. As previously
discussed, under these conditions, poor patients are served only if the hospital is nonprofit. However, this

A-1

does not imply that, for example, merger to monopoly will necessarily increase welfare. The change in
welfare across groups is given by:
q
P1
ΔW = ⎡⎢ ∫ 2 [ P2 ( x) + α − c]dx ⎤⎥ − ⎡⎢ ∫ D q1 ( x)dx ⎤⎥
⎣ 0
⎦ ⎣ P1
⎦
M

M

The first term is the surplus generated in Market 2 as a result of such merger to monopoly and the second
term is the loss of consumer surplus in Market 1. As expected the desirability of merger (i.e. suppression
of competition) increases with α , the additional value that society places on each unit of the poor's
consumption. While the nonprofit monopolist does not consider α when choosing the quantity of
services to the poor, a greater α will increase the social benefits from eliminating competition.
Subsequently this would raise the attractiveness of 501(c)(3) organizations as a vehicle for achieving social
goals.
Following Proposition 2, the price for paying consumers chosen by the monopolist (problem (1)) is given
by P1M =

P1* =

a1 + c ⋅ b1
, whereas, the price chosen by the social planner (problem (2)) is given by
2 ⋅ b1

λ ⋅ a1 + (1 + λ ) ⋅ c ⋅ b1
. The profit condition a1 > c ⋅ b1 is necessary and sufficient for P1M > P1* .1 Hence,
(1 + 2λ ) ⋅ b1

as in the general case, the altruistic nonprofit monopolist overprices healthcare to the rich and overprovides services to the poor.

1

Proof:

a1 > c ⋅ b1
⇒ a1 ⋅ b1 > c ⋅ b12 ⇒ a1 ⋅ b1 + c ⋅ b12 > 2 ⋅ c ⋅ b12
⇒ a1 ⋅ b1 + c ⋅ b12 + 2 ⋅ λ ⋅ (a1 ⋅ b1 + c ⋅ b12 ) > 2 ⋅ c ⋅ b12 + 2 ⋅ λ ⋅ (a1 ⋅ b1 + c ⋅ b12 )
⇒ (a1 + c ⋅ b1 ) ⋅ (1 + 2 ⋅ λ ) ⋅ b1 > 2 ⋅ b1 ⋅ (λ ⋅ a1 + (1 + λ ) ⋅ c ⋅ b1 ) ⇒

a1 + c ⋅ b1 λ ⋅ a1 + (1 + λ ) ⋅ c ⋅ b1
>
2 ⋅ b1
(1 + 2 ⋅ λ ) ⋅ b1

⇒ P1M > P1*

Appendix C: Construction of price measures
Both price measures analyzed in this paper are constructed using information on
hospitals’ actual revenue from private payers as a percentage of their total list charges to
private payers. The percentages are derived from the OSHPD financial disclosure reports,
which provide gross and net inpatient revenue from third party payers, separately for
“traditional” insurance products (i.e., fee-for-service plans) and managed care insurance
products. Individual patient records in the hospital discharge data identify (1) the list
charges associated with the visit, (2) the payer category (private, Medicare, Medicaid,
etc.), and (3) whether the plan type is traditional or managed care. This facilitates
matching the plan type discount factor to the patient's plan type.
The steps in computing the two price measures are as follows. We first compute the
hospital-level ratio of net revenue to gross revenue in each year, separately for private
traditional products and private managed care products. We exclude data from Kaiser
hospitals because they do not report financial data and generally do not treat non-Kaiser
patients. For each type of products, we then clean the resulting ratios by bottom-capping
them at annual 5th percentile, and top-capping them at annual 95th percentile of ratios
across hospitals.
We estimate the net payment to hospitals as the weighted average of charges by payer
category and plan type. The charges are from the patient-level discharge data and we
weight them using ratios obtained from the previous step.
Finally, we construct two price measures: an overall severity-adjusted price, and a price
index based on conditions (DRGs) treated at a broad set of hospitals. The severityadjusted price is computed as the ratio of the total net payment to the total DRG unitsc1 at
hospital-year level. The price index is the within DRG net payment averaged across

c1

DRG units are the case weights attached to DRGs; these weights indicate the national average relative
cost of care. For example, a patient in a DRG with a weight of 4 is twice as costly to treat on average as a
patient in a DRG with a weight of 2.

hospitals. For the small number of hospital-years with some missing DRGs, we impute
the missing index using the full sample averages.c2
Table C1 lists the DRGs used in constructing the price index. As shown in Figure C1, the
two price measures are highly correlated and have similar magnitudes.

It would likely be possible to obtain a better price index by regressing each component price in the index
on the other prices and the severity-adjusted price.
