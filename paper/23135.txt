The Country Chronologies to Exchange Rate Arrangements into the 21st Century: ¸˛Will the
Anchor Currency Hold?

NBER Working Paper No. 23135
February 2017
JEL No. E5,F3,F4,N2
ABSTRACT
Detailed country-by-country chronologies are an informative companion piece to our paper
“Exchange Arrangements Entering the 21st Century: Which Anchor Will Hold?,” which provides
a comprehensive history of anchor or reference currencies, exchange rate arrangements, and a
new measure of foreign exchange restrictions for 194 countries and territories over 1946-2016.
The individual country chronologies are also a central component of our approach to classifying
regimes. These country histories date dual or multiple exchange rate episodes, as well as to
differentiate between pre-announced pegs, crawling pegs, and bands from their de facto
counterparts. We think it is important to distinguish between say, de facto pegs or bands from
announced pegs or bands, because their properties are potentially different. The chronologies also
flag the dates for important turning points, such as when the exchange rate first floated, or when
the anchor currency was changed. We extend our chronologies as far back as possible, even
though we only classify regimes from 1946 onwards.

-2About the Chronologies and Charts
Below we describe how to use and interpret the country chronologies.
1. Using the chronologies
The individual country chronologies are also a central component of our approach to
classifying regimes. The data are constructed by culling information from annual issues of various
secondary sources, including Pick’s Currency Yearbook, Pick’s World Currency Report, Pick’s Black
Market Yearbook, International Financial Statistics, the IMF’s Annual Report on Exchange Rate
Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions, and the United Nations Yearbook. Constructing our data
set required us to sort and interpret information for every year from every publication above.
Importantly, we draw on national sources to investigate apparent data errors or inconsistencies. More
generally, we rely on the broader economics literature to include pertinent information.
The chronologies allow us to date dual or multiple exchange rate episodes, as well as to
differentiate between pre-announced pegs, crawling pegs, and bands from their de facto counterparts.
We think it is important to distinguish between say, de facto pegs or bands from announced pegs or
bands, because their properties are potentially different. The chronologies also flag the dates for
important turning points, such as when the exchange rate first floated, or when the anchor currency
was changed.
Note that we extend our chronologies as far back as possible (even though we can only
classify from 1946 onwards.) The second column gives the arrangement, according to our Natural
classification algorithm, which may or may not correspond to the official classification. In numerous
cases there are dual or multiple rates in some periods. In these circumstances, our classification
algorithm relies on the market-determined, rather than the official exchange rate. Over some periods
the discrepancy between the official and parallel rate proved to be small. In these instances, we leave
the notation in the second column that there are dual rates, but note in the third column that the premia
is in single digits. For periods where the twelve-month monthly inflation exceeded 40 percent, our
algorithm automatically categorizes these as freely falling exchange rate regimes—unless there is a

-3pre-announced peg crawling peg or narrow band that is verified. For the freely falling cases, the
second column also notes whether there was a dual market and how our algorithm would categorize
the regime absent knowledge of the inflation rate.
The third column in our chronology gives further sundry information on the regime— e.g., the
width of the announced and de facto bands, etc. The third column also includes information about
developments in the parallel market premium and currency reform.
