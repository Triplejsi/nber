ABSTRACT
This paper studies the transmission of the Global Financial Cycle (GFC) to domestic credit
market conditions in a large emerging market, Turkey, over 2003–13. We use administrative data
covering the universe of corporate credit transactions matched to bank balance sheets to
document four facts: (1) an easing in global financial conditions leads to lower borrowing costs
and an increase in local lending; (2) domestic banks more exposed to international capital
markets transmit the GFC locally; (3) the fall in local currency borrowing costs is larger than
foreign currency borrowing costs due to the comovement of the uncovered interest rate parity
(UIP) premium with the GFC over time; (4) data on posted collateral for new loan issuances
show that collateral constraints do not relax during the boom phase of the GFC.

Introduction

This paper studies how the Global Financial Cycle (GFC) spills over to domestic credit market
conditions at the microeconomic level for a large emerging market economy, Turkey. The GFC
is characterized by synchronized surges and retrenchments in gross capital flows and booms and
busts in risky asset prices and leverage (Rey, 2013), and has a strong common component that
comoves with VIX,1 which is related to US monetary policy and to changes in risk aversion and
uncertainty (Bekaert et al., 2013; Bruno and Shin, 2015a; Miranda-Agrippino and Rey, 2018).
While the majority of research has focused on understanding the aggregate impacts and sources of
the GFC, little is known on how it transmits to countries’ economies and financial sectors.
We provide a granular view of how the GFC impacts local credit conditions by exploiting data
on the universe of credit transactions, including loan-level interest rates and posted collateral,
between banks and firms for Turkey over 2003–13, combined with bank balance sheet information
encompassing local and foreign currency funding of banks. Using these detailed credit data that
cover the entire non-financial corporate sector, we not only trace out the relationship between
the GFC and domestic lending patterns between banks and firms, but we also identify causal
mechanisms that cannot be measured using macro data.
We make two main contributions. Our starting point is Figure 1a that shows a strong comovement between VIX and the average Turkish bank lending rate. This relationship motivates
us to provide evidence on the impact of the GFC on domestic borrowing costs and credit growth
at the firm-bank level, controlling for both firm- and bank-level characteristics, which is our first
contribution. Micro-level regressions uncover economically significant relationships between the
GFC and domestic credit market conditions. We find a baseline micro estimate of the elasticity
of domestic loan growth with respect to changes in VIX equal to −0.067. This micro estimate
implies that fluctuations in VIX can explain, on average, 43% of the observed cyclical loan growth
of the aggregate corporate sector over the sample period. The micro estimate of the elasticity of
the interest rate with respect to changes in VIX in our core specification is 0.019, implying a one
percentage point fall in the borrowing costs for the average firm during the boom phase of the GFC.
As these regressions control for time-varying bank characteristics, the estimates are more reliable
than similar macro estimates using country-level data, which are unable to separate the banking

sectors’ financial conditions from macroeconomic business cycle conditions.
Our second contribution is to provide novel causal evidence on the channels through which
the GFC is transmitted to the domestic credit market by exploiting both bank and loan-level
heterogeneity. We first document that domestic banks that are more exposed to international
capital markets play a key role in transmitting the GFC locally. As Figure 1b shows, Turkey’s
median bank’s non-core liabilities-to-total liabilities ratio comoves with the GFC over the sample
period capturing the cyclicality in domestic banks’ access to non-core funding from global capital
markets. Non-core liabilities are considered as non-traditional (or wholesale) forms of bank funding
and are important sources of funding for fast-growing emerging markets (Hahm et al., 2013). As we

2

show, these liabilities are denominated largely in foreign currency (FX). Our regression identification
strategy exploits the difference in how banks’ reliance on non-core funding impacts their lending
behavior over the GFC. The difference-in-differences methodology based on bank heterogeneity
that we use is common in the literature (e.g., Khwaja and Mian, 2008; Chodorow-Reich, 2014;
Jiménez et al., 2014) and allows us to explicitly control for time-varying firm credit demand using
firm×quarter fixed effects. We find that high non-core banks cut lending rates and lend more during
the boom phase compared to low non-core banks, and vice versa during GFC downturns.2 The
causal identification of such a supply-side channel of the international spillovers of global financial
conditions is not possible using macro data, as the econometrician will not be able to control for
demand-driven borrowing using only aggregate data.
We next document that the fall in borrowing costs is driven by a failure in uncovered interest
rate parity (UIP), where the UIP risk premium comoves with the GFC over time, making local
currency borrowing cheaper relative to foreign currency borrowing during boom phases of the GFC.
Figure 1c highlights this cyclicality at the aggregate level by plotting VIX along with UIP premia,
which are calculated as the difference between the Turkish and US deposit rates and the spot and
the expected Turkish lira (TRY)/US dollar exchange rate,3 and capture the expected excess returns
from investing in the Turkish lira over the US dollar. At the macro level, such returns increase
when VIX is high and decrease when VIX is low, implying that investing in the Turkish lira during
times of tighter global financial conditions is expected to be riskier. Therefore, investors not only
expect to be paid a premium during normal times (as UIP the premium is always above one), but
they expect an even higher premium during bad times.
Using our micro data, we first show that UIP premia exist at the loan-level on average over the
sample by comparing FX and TRY interest rates between the same firm-bank pair in a given quarter.
Interestingly, this result holds even after controlling for time-varying factors like macroeconomic
or exchange rate risks (via the use of time fixed effects). We next show that the differential in
FX and TRY borrowing costs comoves with VIX, but the magnitude and significance of this effect
are statistically indistinguishable from zero once we control for time-varying firm credit risk and
bank heterogeneity in access to foreign currency funding, along with cyclical movements in this
2

Baskaya et al. (2017) show that during capital inflow episodes into Turkey, banks that mostly fund themselves
through non-core liabilities expand their credit supply. In this paper, we provide the novel result that banks with a
high non-core liability ratio reduce their lending rates relatively more during periods of low VIX, and even more for
local currency loans, even though the non-core liabilities are largely in FX.

interest rate differential driven by the GFC. To the best of our knowledge, this empirical result
– which cannot be identified using only macro data – has never been shown before, and is not
straightforward to rationalize with existing models that assume an exogenous and static countrylevel UIP violation (see Gopinath and Stein, 2017, for a recent contribution that endogenizes this
violation, in a static framework, for a representative bank/firm).
The above findings that (i) high non-core banks offer lower pricing and supply more loans, and
(ii) the cyclicality in the UIP premium that renders the TRY-denominated loans relatively cheaper,
are consistent with each other. We show that banks more reliant on non-core FX liabilities provide
more TRY-denominated loans than FX-denominated loans during the boom phase of the GFC. As
a result, in the aggregate data, TRY-denominated loans grow more than FX-denominated loans
when capital flows in.
Finally, using monthly loan-level data on collateral posted for new loan issuances and motivated
by the acyclicality of the aggregate collateral-to-loans ratio vis-à-vis the VIX (see Figure 1d), we
study whether borrowing constraints are relaxed during the boom phase of the GFC via a “collateral
channel.” Regressions reveal that there is no relation between loan amounts and posted collateral
in general, and in addition loan amounts do not respond to changes in the collateral-to-loan ratio
during high- or low-VIX episodes. This result survives even after we account for time-varying
firm and bank factors, such as credit demand and firm default risk and focusing on the same
firm borrowing from the same bank. Including these controls is important since as Guerrieri and
Lorenzoni (2017) show in a heterogeneous agent environment, shocks to agents’ borrowing capacity
affect both borrowers’ demand for loans and lenders’ supply of loans, and we want to solely focus
on the supply side. This result is also novel, and has important implications for the theoretical
macro-finance literature, which models financial market imperfections by assuming that firms face
collateral constraints and these constraints relax or tighten with asset price movements. Thus, in
theory, constraints should relax with capital flows. We show that this is not the case in an emerging
market, where capital flows are intermediated through the domestic banking system.
Finding no relation between posted collateral and loan amounts does not mean collateral is
not an important variable for loans. In fact, we uncover a strong relation between loan rates and
posted collateral. Conditional on time-varying bank factors, the loan rate is lower for a higher level
of posted collateral on that loan. This negative relation between the loan rate and loan collateral
gets stronger when VIX is high and gets weaker when VIX is low. When we consider the same firm
borrowing from the same bank, the negative relation between the loan rate and collateral no longer
4

changes with fluctuations in VIX. These results further support our key message that irrespective
of collateral values, firms are able to borrow more as a result of lower interest rates, which increase
firms’ ability to repay their loans. In fact, when we run a horse race between the effect of collateral
versus the interest rates on credit growth, it turns out that lower interest rates are more important
for credit expansion than higher collateral values.
We consider other possible channels through which the GFC may impact the domestic credit
market, as well as running numerous robustness checks. We first explore whether high non-core
banks alter their risk profile by changing the average maturity of loans they issue over the GFC,
and find that these banks do indeed increase their risk by issuing longer maturity loans during the
boom phase of the GFC. We further explore the role of bank leverage and size, variables often used
to capture a “risk-taking” channel, on our results. The inclusion of these variables do not impact
the size or significance of the non-core interaction coefficient. Finally, another possible channel we
investigate is the role of exchange rate fluctuations on balance sheet strength. Banks balance sheets
are required to be hedged for foreign currency exposure in Turkey by law, so we study the effect of
possible firm balance sheet mismatches on credit outcomes. We do not find any effect of exchange
rate fluctuations on credit outcomes for firms’ with a currency mismatch on their balance sheets.
This result is consistent with our result that did not find any role for collateral values. Even if firm
balance sheets get a positive net worth (collateral) shock with an appreciation of the local currency
vis-à-vis the USD, on the supply side banks do not seem to change their pricing for such firms
and/or provide more credit to these firms, even though these firms might demand more credit.
Overall, these additional checks do not impact our finding on the relative importance of high
non-core banks in transmitting the GFC to the domestic credit market. This result points to the
non-core channel being akin in spirit to the risk-taking channel highlighted in work such as Bruno
and Shin (2015b) or Coimbra and Rey (2017). While those papers focus on changes in balance
sheet strength over the cycle, the non-core channel is a function of the composition of only the
liabilities side of the balance sheet, rather than a net position. However, the non-core channel is
still consistent with a risk-taking channel as high non-core banks’ financial constraints will relax
(tighten) by a fall (rise) in external funding costs during the boom (bust) cycle of the GFC. The
difference is such relaxation works via cost of funding instead of volume of funding related to balance
sheet strength.

Related Literature

Our paper relates to several strands of the literature. First, we contribute to the literature that has
so far focused on the effects of GFC (as proxied by movements in VIX) on cross-border capital flows,
asset prices, and credit growth using aggregate cross-country data (e.g., Forbes and Warnock, 2012;
Cerutti et al., 2015; Jordà et al., 2017; Fratzscher et al., 2018; Miranda-Agrippino and Rey, 2018).
This literature is silent on the evidence regarding the transmission mechanism, and in particular
at the bank and firm levels. Our evidence on the transmission channel is complementary to models
that emphasize the risk-taking channel of monetary policy. These models emphasize that during
the boom phase of GFC, low interest rates in the U.S. creates abundant liquidity in dollar funding
markets (Bruno and Shin, 2015a). Global banks provide more dollar funding across borders as their
value-at-risk constraints relax with low U.S. rates and low VIX. We drill down one more layer and
argue that domestic banks, which obtain their dollar funding from global banks, in turn, provide
more funding to domestic firms at a lower cost; a mechanism of pass-through from a lower cost of
international funding for domestic banks to a lower cost of borrowing for domestic firms.4
Second, our finding on the increasing share of local currency borrowing vis-à-vis foreign currency
borrowing in the aggregate data is consistent with the fall in the UIP risk premium we show and
consistent with the models that endogenize the UIP deviations over time to external shocks and
financial intermediation, such as Salomao and Varela (2016), Akinci and Queralto (2019), and
Basu et al. (2020). Such models predict a fall in the UIP risk premium and a rise in the share of
local currency borrowing for a favorable shock. The macro evidence in Kalemli-Özcan and Varela
(2019) and Kalemli-Özcan (2019) show that in emerging markets, the UIP risk premium moves with
interest rate differentials and not with exchange rate fluctuations, where a key driver of interest
rate differentials is capital flows driven by the changes in VIX and U.S. monetary policy. These
results are also consistent with our findings.
Third, the evidence on the transmission mechanism we provide speaks to how financial constraints relax during the GFC. We find that the main mechanism underlying the relaxation of
financial constraints is rather different from the standard “higher asset prices–higher collateral–
4

In fast-growing bank-based emerging markets, domestic bank intermediation of capital inflows is typical since
domestic deposits are not large enough to fund banks who in turn finance growth. See Reinhart and Rogoff (2009)
and Hahm et al. (2013).

more borrowing” channel. This channel rests on models where the liquidation value of physical
assets serve as the collateral that determines the amount of borrowing by firms, and this collateral
value may fluctuate with aggregate shocks that affect asset prices (e.g., see Bernanke et al., 1999;
Kiyotaki and Moore, 1997; Bernanke and Gertler, 1989; Calvo, 1998; Caballero and Krishnamurthy,
2001; Mendoza, 2010). Our results on the relaxation of financial constraints through lower interest
rates is important in helping to identify two alternative margins of adjustment in the domestic
credit market: firms can borrow at lower rates on average, while their “hard” collateral constraints
do not change much over the boom part of the cycle. Thus, collateral-constrained firms are still
allowed only to borrow some fraction of their capital stock, and this amount may not change if
the value of the capital stock does not change much when capital flows into the banking sector as
opposed to the corporate sector (see Fostel and Geanakoplos, 2015, for a theoretical contribution
that rationalizes this channel).
Finally, last but not least, we contribute to the literature on the international transmission
of shocks, where most of this literature focuses on the role of foreign banks (e.g., Cetorelli and
Goldberg, 2011). Recently, this literature also emphasized the role of U.S. monetary policy in
channeling bank flows across borders, as in the work of Bräuning and Ivashina (2018) and Ivashina
et al. (2015). The latter paper focuses on the role of dollar-funding supply in global markets on
foreign banks’ lending elsewhere, while we focus on the receiving side; that is domestic banks’
borrowing from foreign banks and global investors over the GFC.

Data Description

We merge two large micro-level panel data sets that are official registers. Specifically, we merge
bank-level balance sheets with individual loan-level data between banks and firms using unique bank
and firm identifiers. We further augment this data set with Turkish and world macroeconomic and
financial data. The final data set for all existing loans is at the quarterly frequency and covers the
universe of loans and every balance sheet item in the banks’ regulatory filings. We transform all
loan and bank variables to real values, using 2003 as the base year for inflation adjustment. We
further clean and winsorize the data in order to eliminate the impact of outliers.5 We also create a
monthly data set based on new loan issuances using the credit register data, which we also merge
in with bank characteristics in order to study the collateral channel in our last set of results. We

3.1

Credit Register

The detailed monthly loan transaction-level data are collected by the Banking Regulation and
Supervision Agency (BRSA), and provided to us by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey
(CBRT). Banks have to report outstanding loans at the level of firms and individuals monthly to
the BRSA at the transaction level.6 For instance, if a firm has five loans with different maturities
and interest rates at the branch of a bank and two other loans at another branch of the same bank,
the bank then has to report all seven loans separately as long as each of the loans’ outstanding
amounts is above the bank-specific reporting cutoff level. If a loan’s outstanding amount is below
the bank’s reporting cutoff then the bank may aggregate such small loans at the branch-level and
report the aggregated amounts. This data set provides the same information as found in credit
register data in other countries, but contains a more comprehensive list of variables. In particular,
besides providing the amount of a loan outstanding between a given individual (household, firm,
government) and a bank, the data set also provides several other key pieces of information, such as
the (i) interest rate; (ii) maturity date as well as extended maturity dates if relevant; (iii) collateral
provided; (iv) credit limit (only beginning in 2007); (v) currency of the loan; (vi) detailed industry
codes for the activity classification for which the loan is borrowed for, as well as the breakdown of
consumer usage of loan (e.g., credit card, mortgage); (vii) bank-determined risk measures of the
loans.
The data are cleaned at the loan level before we aggregate up to the firm-bank-currency denomination level for our regression analysis. Note that we will refer to this level of aggregation
as the firm-bank level for ease of exposition in the remainder of the paper. The data cleaning
is extensive and there are certain unique features of the Turkish data that must be tackled and
which we describe in brief next. First, we use cash loans in terms of outstanding principal, since
credit limit data are not available for the full sample period. Moreover, these loans naturally map
into the data used to measure aggregate credit growth. Second, a significant component of lending
in Turkey takes place in foreign currency (FX).7 We clean the data to deal with exchange rate
issues as follows. There are two types of FX loans, which banks report differently in terms of the
Turkish lira (TRY) each month. The first type of FX loan is one that is indexed to exchange rate

There is a minimum loan-size cutoff under which banks do not have to report the individual transactions to the
authorities.

movements. This type of loan is reported based on its initial TRY value each period, and thus is
not adjusted by banks for exchange rate movements (of course, the value of these types of loans
may still change if borrowers pay back some of the loans, for example). The second type of FX
loan is issued in foreign currency. The TRY value of this type of loan is adjusted each period to
account for exchange rate movements. This naturally creates a valuation effect, which we need to
correct for in order to not under/overstate the value of the TRY loan in the period following the
initial loan issuance. For example, imagine that over a month there are no new loans issued and no
repayments made. A depreciation of the TRY against the USD would appear to increase total loans
outstanding for all existing FX loans issued in dollars. This valuation effect would in turn manifest
itself as an expansion of credit when measured in TRY, but this expansion would solely have been
due to a currency depreciation, rather than issues of new loans. We adjust for this valuation effect
using official end-of-period exchange rates, before summing the data over firm-bank pairs for FX
and TRY loans, where we sum all FX loans (expressed in TRY).
We then adjust the individual loans for inflation to ensure comparability over time. The baseline
regressions pool loans regardless of their maturity. Roughly half of the loans have maturities less
than or equal to one year. We therefore also run robustness regressions where we split the sample
along maturity levels.
3.1.1

Outstanding Loans Data

We use end-of-quarter data for a given firm-bank pair. The key reason for doing so is that capital
flows and other macro/global variables are at the quarterly level. The final cleaned data set, before
aggregation to the firm-bank level for a given quarter, contains roughly 53 million loan records over
the December 2003–December 2013 period. Figure A1 compares the growth rate of the aggregated
loans in our data set (‘Firms’) to aggregate credit growth for the whole economy (‘Firms + NonFirms’). The two series track each other very closely, with a correlation of 0.86.8 Further, as
Figure A2 shows, the majority of loans between firm-bank pairs in a given quarter (in terms of
value) are due to continuing loans (i.e., the intensive margin).9
Table 1 presents annual information and summary statistics on the share of FX loans in terms
8

The two series are not as strongly correlated at the beginning of the sample due to the aftermath of the crisis
in 2001, which was driven by corporate and government debt and fixed exchange rate. This in turn implies that
corporate and household debt growth diverged in the 2003–05 period.
9
A continuing loan (intensive margin) is a new loan for the given bank-firm relationship, that is from one quarter
to other, there is a new loan for a given pair where this pair already had a loan relationship before. A new loan
(extensive margin), on the other hand, is the appearance of a new firm-bank relationship for the first time in that
quarter.

Notes: This table presents annual summary statistics of the credit register coverage of loans, over the 2003–13
period, using end-of-year data. Columns (1)-(3) present the FX share of loans within the data sample: column (1)
presents the overall share, while columns (2) and (3) break down the share between domestic and foreign banks. The
bottom panel presents summary statistics over the eleven years of data.

of total loans for (1) all banks, (2) domestic banks, and (3) foreign banks.10 In looking at the
summary statistics, we see that on average that all types of banks have an approximately even split
between FX and TRY over the sample period. However, the share of FX loans in foreign banks’
portfolios declined over the sample period, whereas the share for domestic banks remained more
stable.
Table 2 reports summary statistics on banks, firms, and firm-bank pairs in the register for the
end of the year for all banks, domestic banks, and foreign banks. Column (1) shows that the number
of banks in our sample varies over time, with domestic banks being in the majority. Further, most
firms borrow from domestic banks (column 2). We next turn to the bilateral relationships between
banks and firms in columns (3)-(5). We see in column (3) that on average about 44% of firms
borrow from more than one bank, but this lending makes up a large proportion of the total value of

Notes: This table presents annual summary statistics on the frequency of different types of firm-bank relationships
within the credit register using end-of-year data for all, domestic, and foreign banks. Columns (1) and (2) list the
number of banks and firms, respectively; columns (3) and (4) presents the share of loans (relative to total) from firms
with multiple bank relationships, in terms of loan number and loan value, respectively; and column (5) presents the
average number of multiple banking relationships a firm has in a given year.

loans – 75% for all banks, 73% for domestic banks, and 82% for foreign banks on average according
to column (4). Finally, column (5) shows that the average number of relationships that a firm has
with banks in a given quarter is approximately three for all types of banks.
Table 3 presents summary statistics for the credit register data for outstanding loans aggregated
at the firm-bank pair each quarter. The table pools all the loans, regardless of the currency of
denomination in panel A, while panels B and C present statistics on TRY and FX loans separately
(i.e., the unit of observation is firm-bank-denomination in all panels). The table reports summary
statistics for (i) loans outstanding in thousands of 2003 TRY, (ii) the nominal interest rate, and
(iii) the remaining maturity (in months) of a loan. These are the data that form the basis for our
regression samples when we are not focusing on new loan issuances.11 As one can see, there is a lot
of heterogeneity in the size of loans, as well as borrowing rates. In comparing panels B and C, one

also sees that FX loans are on average larger and cheaper than TRY loans. This fact motivates
us to always include a currency denomination dummy in our pooled regressions, as well as further
investigating whether the differential in FX and TRY interest rates and loan growth vary with the
GFC.
Note that since we are aggregating over several potential loans between a given bank and firm
pair in a given period, we need to take into account the size of the individual loans in calculating
an “effective” interest rate and maturity for the firm-bank pair. We do this by creating weighted
averages based on a loan’s share in total loans between each firm-bank pair in a given period. We
allow the weights to vary depending on the unit of analysis we consider, and they also vary over
time. Larger loans’ interest rates get a bigger weight.12 We want the weights to be time-varying
to capture the time variation in the interest rates of the loan portfolio of a given firm-bank pair.
Therefore, in panel A, when we pool the TRY and FX loans, the weight’s numerator is simply
the loan value of an individual loan, while its denominator is the sum of all TRY and FX loans
between a firm-bank pair in a given period. In panels B and C, the weight’s numerator is again
the individual loan value, while the denominator is total TRY loans in panel B, and in panel C the
denominator is total FX loans.13
3.1.2

New Loan Issuances Data

Table 4 presents the summary statistics for data on new loan issuances, which we use in our
collateral channel regressions below. Unlike the summary statistics presented in Table 3, the
underlying data of Table 4 are at the individual loan level rather than being aggregated up to
the firm-bank (currency denomination) level. Therefore, there is no need to construct weighted
variables based on loan values like before. Besides presenting information on the size of the loan,
interest rate and maturity level, we also present summary statistics on the collateral-to-loan ratio
for a given loan. This variable can vary quite a bit across loans with some loans having either (i)
zero collateral posted, or (ii) very little credit (i.e., loan) drawn for a given collateral posted. Given
the second, we winsorize the collateral-to-loan ratio at a value of 200% to deal with outliers.14 We

Note that the collateral-to-loan ratio can be greater than one for several reasons. First, banks may ask for
more collateral than the loan value, since the collateral may also include liquidation costs or legal costs, or other
risks attached to the collateral. Second, depending on the type of collateral posted, such as residential property,

Notes: This table presents summary statistics using quarterly data for aggregate firm-bank transactions over the
2003–13 period. The sample includes loans for all firm-bank pairs reported in the data set. Panel A presents data
based on pooling all FX and TRY transactions at the firm-bank-quarter level; Panel B considers only Turkish lira
loans, and Panel C considers only FX loans (expressed in Turkish liras). Loan is the end-of-quarter total outstanding
principal for all loans between a firm-bank pair, in thousands of Turkish lira and adjusted for inflation; Interest Rate
is the weighted average of the nominal rates, reported for loans between a firm-bank pair, where the weights are
constructed based on loan shares between a firm-bank pair in a given quarter, and are based on either all, TRY, or
FX loans for Panels A-C, respectively; Maturity is the weighted average of the initial time to repayment reported
for loans of a firm-bank pair, which is measured in months, and where the weights are constructed based on loan
shares between a firm-bank pair in a given quarter, and are based on either all, TRY, or FX loans for panels A-C,
respectively.

further drop all loans with zero collateral posted for this part of the analysis, since we are using the
collateral as a measure of financial constraints and these zero-collateral loans are generally given to
very large multinationals or for loan amounts that are very small compared to firm value. Dropping
these observations decreases the sample by approximately thirty percent.
banks require collateral up to 200% of the loan value. Third, firms must post collateral for the whole credit line (or
multiple credit lines) requested, even if the initial loan withdrawal is less than the amount. We therefore winsorize
the collateral-to-loan ratio at a value of 200% to match an upper-bound used by the banks. Further, note that the
book and market values of the collateral are the same since we observe each loan and collateral posted only once in
a given month given our focus on new issuances.

Notes: This table presents summary statistics using monthly data for new loan issuances over the 2003–13 period.
The sample includes loans for all firm-bank pairs reported in the data set. Panel A presents data based on pooling
all FX and TRY transactions at the firm-bank-quarter level; Panel B considers only Turkish lira loans, and Panel C
considers only FX loans (expressed in Turkish liras). Loan is the outstanding principal of the new loan, in thousands
of Turkish lira and adjusted for inflation; Interest Rate is the loan’s nominal lending; Maturity is the initial time
to repayment reported for the new loan, which is measured in months; Collateral/Loan is the ratio of the collateral
posted to the outstanding principal of the new loan.

The majority of loans (roughly 90%) are denominated in TRY. However, as with the summary
statistics using loans aggregated up to the firm-bank level, new loan issuances in TRY are considerably smaller and more expensive than FX loans. Furthermore, the average TRY loan’s maturity
is approximately five months longer than an FX loan (the differential at the firm-bank level of
aggregation is only two months). Interestingly, the average collateral-to-loan ratio is higher for
TRY-denominated loans, but this differential is not large – 1.175 months for TRY loans vs. 1.082
months for FX loans.

Bank-Level Data

Turkey, like many major emerging markets, has a bank dominated financial sector: in 2014, banks
held 86% of the country’s financial assets and roughly 90% of total financial liabilities. The past
decade has witnessed a doubling of bank deposits and assets, while loans have increased five-fold.
Our baseline analysis uses quarterly bank balance sheet data from Turkey for the 2003–2013 period.
The data are collected at the monthly level, and we use March, June, September, and December
reports. All banks operating within Turkey are required to report their balance sheets as well as
extra items to the regulatory and supervisory authorities – such as the CBRT and the Banking
Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA) – by the end of the month.
Table 5 presents summary statistics based on end-of-year values for the banking sector as a
whole for all banks (Panel A), domestic banks (Panel B), and foreign banks (Panel C). Looking at
the total banking sector level in panel A, we see that on average over the sample period the sector’s
assets represented approximately 78 percent of GDP, loans 38 percent, and deposits 46 percent.
Looking at the same statistics in panels B and C, we see that domestic banks dominate overall
banking activity relative to foreign banks. This is an important fact to note and makes Turkey
different than other large emerging markets (e.g., Mexico), where foreign banks play a larger role
in the banking sector. Specifically, over the 2003–13 period there are 45 banks, of which 28 are
commercial (domestic and foreign), 14 are investment and development, and 5 are branches of
foreign banks.15 Our sample of banks varies between 35 and 43 throughout the period since we
focus on banks that are active in the corporate loan market and this number changes from period
to period.
Table 6 presents summary statistics based on end-of-quarter values both at the bank level for
all banks (Panel A), domestic banks (Panel B), and foreign banks (Panel C), and summarize the
banking variables we include in our regressions. These variables, like others used in the paper, are
winsorized at the one-percent level. There is quite a bit of variation in bank size (as measured
by total assets), the capital ratio, the leverage ratio, the non-core ratio, liquidity ratio, and return
on assets (ROA) across banks and over time. In comparing domestic and foreign banks, we see
that domestic banks are larger on average as well as having a larger leverage ratio. Meanwhile,
foreign banks have larger non-core, liquidity and capital ratios on average. It is also instructive to
15

Note that in the aftermath of the 2001 crisis, the weak capital structure of the Turkish banks resulted in a number
of takeovers. As a result, in the 2000–04 period, a total of 25 banks were taken over by Deposit-Insurance Fund,
SDIF. Our sample begins at the end of this period, where the majority of takeovers were completed.

the distributions of the various bank characteristics overlap across the domestic and foreign bank
groups.

Understanding Non-core Liabilities

Finally, we compare bank-level variables across groups of banks that we split into “low” and “high”
non-core banks in Table 7. We do this as the non-core variable is our key variable to proxy access
to international markets that will be used in our difference-in-differences regressions below. In
particular, we construct a non-core liabilities ratio, where the denominator is total liabilities that
is defined as deposits (core funding) + non-core funding. Non-core liabilities equals Payables to

Notes: This table presents summary statistics on bank-level variables using quarterly data pooled over 2003–13 for

median. A low non-core bank has a mean below the sample median, while a high non-core bank
has a mean greater than or equal to the median. As can be seen in Figure 2, banks with high
non-core liabilities are the ones that borrow internationally since a large part of these liabilities are
in foreign currency.16
Note that high and low non-core banks can either be domestic or foreign banks.17 Comparing
the two groups in Table 7, it is interesting to first note that the low non-core banks are larger on
average, as well as having larger leverage ratios than the high non-core bank sample.18 This fact,
in part, motivates some further robustness regressions we run below. Meanwhile, high non-core
banks have somewhat larger liquidity and capital ratios than the low non-core sample, and the
ROA is about the same across both groups on average. What is important for our purposes is the
time-series relation between non-core liabilities and foreign financing (capital flows). As shown in
Figures 3 and 4, domestic banks’ non-core liabilities move together with capital flows (both total
and banking sector), whereas foreign banks’ do not.
16

Turkish banks’ liabilities to each other are in TRY.
The two non-core groups are quite balanced along the domestic/foreign bank split, with the low non-core sample
having 63% of the banks being domestic, while the high non-core sample is composed of 64% of domestic banks.
18
Notice that leverage ratios are based on total liabilities and high non-core banks can have high leverage in terms
of short-term liabilities since non-core funding is mostly short-term.

against log(VIX) and Turkish capital inflows in panels (a) and (b), respectively. Movements in the
VIX tend to be negatively correlated with Turkey’s credit growth, and positively correlated with
the current account balance (a fall in the current account implies an increase in net capital inflows).
The loan-to-GDP growth fluctuates between 5 to 10 percent quarterly during our sample. Looking at a more direct measure of capital inflows to Turkey, we see that this measure is positively
correlated to Turkey’s credit growth, while negatively correlated with its current account. These
correlations are consistent with the story as described for VIX in the introduction.
Firms’ direct external borrowing is very limited in Turkey and hence banks are the key intermediary of capital flows. As Figure 7 shows, the external corporate bond issuance is negligible as
a percentage of GDP, whereas banks’ external borrowing is as high as 40 percent of GDP at the
end of our sample period.
Table A1 presents summary statistics for the quarterly Turkish and global macroeconomic and
financial variables that we use as controls in our regressions, as well as measures of global financial
conditions. All real variables are deflated using 2003 as the base year. The Turkish macroeconomic
data are taken from the CBRT. VIX and the Turkish overnight rate are quarterly averages. There

Empirical Facts

4.1

Fact 1: Macro Regressions for the GFC, Credit Growth and Loan Rates

We begin with “macro” regressions, which regress the nominal interest rate (i) and the loan principal
outstanding (Loan) on our measure of the GFC, log(VIX). Regressions are weighted-least squares,
where weights are time series mean of the natural logarithm of a bank’s total assets.19 The standard
errors are double clustered at the firm and time levels.20 We run
log Yf,b,d,q = αf,b + λTrendq + β log VIXq−1 + δFXf,b,d,q + Θ1 iq−1 + Θ2 ∆ log(GDPq−1 )

(1)

+ Θ3 Inflationq−1 + Θ4 ∆ log(XRq−1 ) + Θ5 Bankb,q−1 + εf,b,d,q ,
where Yf,b,d,q is either Loansf,b,d,q or one plus the nominal interest rate (1 + if,b,d,q ), for a given
firm-bank (f , b) pair in a given currency denomination (d) and quarter (q), αf,b is a firm×bank
fixed effect, which controls for unobserved firm and bank-level time-invariant heterogeneity, and
Trendq is a linear trend variable. FX is a dummy variable that is equal to 1 if the firm-bank loan
observation is in foreign currency, and 0 if it is in Turkish lira. We use the VIX index in logs as the
proxy for GFC. Using firm×bank fixed effects allows us to identify from within firm-bank variation
19

We also run regressions using OLS and the results are similar to the WLS ones.
Petersen (2009) shows that the best practice is to cluster at both levels, or if the number of clusters is small in
one dimension, then use a fixed effect for that dimension and cluster on the other dimension, where more clusters are
available.

comparing given firm-bank pairs over time.
The firm-bank level interest rates will be a function of the domestic policy rates (iq−1 ) plus the
firm risk premium.21 If UIP holds, the domestic policy rate is equal to the sum of the foreign interest
rate and the expected exchange rate change. We include the domestic policy rate directly, as we
later document a UIP violation. We control for macro fundamentals in every specification, proxied
by GDP growth, inflation and fluctuations in the exchange rate (XR). We also add under Bank, a
set of bank characteristics that control for bank heterogeneity, including log(assets), capital ratio,
liquidity ratio, non-core liabilities ratio, and return on total assets (ROA). These variables are
standard in the literature and importantly include the inverse of banks’ leverage (i.e., the capital
ratio), which has been highlighted as responding to global financial conditions and wealth effects
arising from exchange rate and asset price changes (e.g., Bruno and Shin, 2015a,b), thus allowing
banks to expand their lending. We lag all the controls.
Table 8 presents the results for regression (1) for all firm-bank relationships, as well as splitting
the sample between domestic and foreign banks. The estimated coefficient for the effect of VIX on
the interest rate in panel A for all banks, 0.019, for all banks implies a 1 percentage point fall in
the average borrowing rate resulting from a fall in log(VIX) equal to its interquartile range over
21

We will explicitly control time-varying firm risk premium in our difference-in-differences framework below; here
only the average level of firm riskiness is controlled through the use of firm fixed effects.

22

the sample period. The baseline micro estimates of the elasticity of domestic loan growth with
respect to changes in VIX is −0.067. We use this estimated VIX coefficient to quantify the effect
of movements in VIX on aggregate credit growth. Appendix A.1 provides an aggregation equation,
which shows how to use the micro estimates to draw implications for aggregate credit growth over
the cycle. We can explain on average 43 percent of observed cyclical aggregate loan growth to the
corporate sector.22
There are some interesting differences when looking at the estimated coefficients on log(VIX) in
the domestic and foreign bank sub-samples. First, while the interest rate coefficients in panel A are
positive and highly significant for both the domestic and foreign bank sub-samples, the coefficient
estimated in the domestic bank sample is almost twice as large as that of the foreign bank sample,
0.22 vs. 0.12. Therefore, it appears that Turkish domestic banks are more responsive to the GFC
than foreign ones operating in Turkey. This difference is even more striking when turning to the
loan-VIX elasticities estimated in panel B. Here, the coefficient on log(VIX) is negative and strongly
significant for domestic banks, while it’s actually slightly positive and statistically insignificant for
foreign banks. These results point to the crucial role that domestic banks playing in transmitting
the GFC to the Turkish credit market, a result that differs drastically from the literature that
focuses on the role of foreign banks in transmitting foreign monetary policy (e.g., Morais et al.,
2019).23

Demand and Supply Factors: Capital Inflows and the GFC
The GFC, as proxied by VIX, is strongly correlated with Turkish capital inflows as Figure 6
depicts. A natural question then arises as to whether the correlation between VIX and capital
inflows is picking up demand, supply, or both. The regressions in Table 8 control for macro
demand factors, such as domestic GDP growth. However, it is also insightful to look at the
log(VIX) coefficient in the interest rate regressions. If movements in VIX were in fact picking up
local demand factors, we would expect loan interest rates to be negatively correlated with VIX. For
example, imagine that VIX falls as global conditions improve and Turkish firms react by beginning
22

We apply (A.4) using βb = −0.067 and the observed change in log(VIX) to obtain predicted aggregate loan growth.
We then divide this series by the linearly detrended series of actual aggregate credit growth, and take the average of
this ratio to arrive at 43 percent.
23
We have also run regressions including both the VIX and measures of monetary policy shocks (Gertler and Karadi,
2015) in Table A2. The regressions show that the coefficients on log(VIX) remain strongly significant. Further, the
coefficients on the monetary policy shocks, FF4 or MP1, in the interest rate regressions are either barely significant or
not significant at all. Meanwhile, the coefficients for these variables in loan volume regressions are highly significant
and of the expected sign.

Notes: This table presents results for the OLS regressions for (1) using quarterly data. Panel A, columns (1)-(3) use
the natural logarithm of one plus the weighted-average of nominal interest rates for loans between a firm-bank as the
dependent variable for the full bank sample, domestic banks, and foreign banks, respectively. Panel B, columns (4)(6) use the natural logarithm of total loans between a firm-bank as the dependent variable for the full bank sample,
domestic banks, and foreign banks, respectively. VIX is the lagged quarterly average. FX is a 0/1 dummy indicating
whether a loan is in foreign currency ( = 1) or domestic ( = 0), the domestic rate is the quarterly average overnight
rate, GDP growth is real quarterly, XR change is the quarterly Turkish lira/US dollar exchange rate change, and
inflation is quarterly CPI changes. A linear time trend is also included as a regressor. Furthermore, the lagged values
of the following bank-level characteristics are also controlled for (not reported): log(assets), capital ratio, liquidity
ratio, non-core liabilities ratio, and return on total assets (ROA). Regressions are all weighted-least square, where
weights are equal to the time-series average of the log of the bank’s total assets, and standard errors are double
clustered at the firm and quarter levels, and ∗∗∗ indicates significance at the 1% level, ∗∗ at the 5% level, and ∗ at
the 10% level.

to demand more credit (which banks in part finance by borrowing from abroad), we would then
expect there to be an upward pressure on lending rates given increased demand, holding banks’
supply constant. This would generate a negative correlation between rates and VIX, which is
counterfactual to our regression results. If, on the other hand, a fall in VIX is associated with an
improvement in global financial conditions and allows Turkish banks to access foreign capital more
cheaply, these banks can then offer loans at a lower interest rate in the domestic credit market.

24

This in turn implies a positive correlation between VIX and lending rates as we find in panel A
of Table 8. Note that under both a demand or supply scenario we would expect the same signed
coefficient between VIX and loan volume – negative as our regressions show. Following this logic,
our first set of regressions, therefore, point to the GFC impacting the domestic credit market from
the supply side, as domestic banks tap global capital markets to finance domestic lending at lower
costs.24
The estimation of (1) may still suffer from omitted demand variable, especially at the firm-level
and thus be biased. We therefore next turn to exploiting bank heterogeneity in their access to
foreign capital in a difference-in-differences regression setup, which allows us to explicitly control
for time-varying firm demand and firm credit risk.25

4.2

Fact 2: Non-core Regressions

To further identify the spillovers from global financing conditions into the domestic credit market
via supply-driven capital inflows, we explore the variation in banks’ exposure to international
financial markets and how this exposure affects the pricing of loans, fully accounting for firm timevarying characteristics and demand for credit. To focus on how the difference in banks’ reliance on
financing via non-traditional (or wholesale) funding impacts their behavior over the GFC, we use
banks’ non-core liabilities. We construct a Non-core ratio, which is non-core liabilities divided by
total liabilities, where non-core liabilities are defined Section 3. We estimate
log Yf,b,d,q = αf,b + αf,q + ζ(Non-coreb × log VIXq−1 ) + δ1 FXf,b,d,q + f,b,d,q ,

(2)

where αf,q is a firm×quarter fixed effect, controlling for firms’ credit demand. Non-coreb is a timeinvariant dummy variable, for whether a bank has a high non-core liabilities ratio or not, where a
24
We have also run a regression of Turkish capital inflows on log(VIX) and the macroeconomic variables used in
(1), augmented for Turkish consumer confidence, which is available from 2004 onwards – the regression thus uses 39
observations in total. This estimated coefficient on log(VIX) is −1.493 and significant at the 1% level. Meanwhile,
while the coefficient on consumer confidence is positive, as would be expected for a capital inflows demand variable,
it is not significant, nor are the rest of the macroeconomic variables.
25
We have also explored the sensitivity of our baseline estimates to firms’ direct exposure to the global economy
by running regressions splitting the sample between exporters and non-exporters in Table A3. The interest rate-VIX
elasticity is indeed smaller for exporters, and larger for the loan volume regressions pointing to potential demand
effects being picked up by VIX. However, note that the coefficients remain strongly significant and are the same sign
as for the non-exporters regressions. Furthermore, exporters make up less than ten percent of our sample of loans.
We have also run the regression based on loans that are earmarked for domestic-activity only (i.e., are not used for
exporting or importing activity according to loan records) in Table A4. Results are robust compared to using all
loans. We also explore the sensitivity of the VIX coefficient across sectors in Table A5. The coefficients on log(VIX)
do not vary very much across sectors. Finally, we have run our baseline regressions given different sample cuts and
other robustness checks in Tables A6 and A7, respectively. All results are robust.

Notes: This table presents results for the OLS regressions for (2) using quarterly data for all loans. Panel A uses
the natural logarithm of one plus the weighted-average of nominal interest rates for loans between a firm-bank as
the dependent variable. Panel B uses the natural logarithm of total loans between a firm-bank as the dependent
variable. VIX is the lagged quarterly average. Non-core is a 0/1 dummy indicating whether a bank is in the “low” (
= 0) or “high” ( = 1) bin of banks defined by their average non-core liabilities ratio over the sample period. FX is a
0/1 dummy indicating whether a loan is in foreign currency ( = 1) or domestic ( = 0), and firm×quarter effects are
included in all specifications. Regressions are all weighted-least square, where weights are equal to the time-series
average of the log of the bank’s total assets, and standard errors are double clustered at the firm and quarter levels,
and ∗∗∗ indicates significance at the 1% level, ∗∗ at the 5% level, and ∗ at the 10% level.

bank is assigned a 1 for “high” if its average non-core ratio over time is larger than the median of
all banks’ non-core over the sample; otherwise, it receives a zero for a “low” non-core bank.26
Table 9 shows that banks with higher non-core liabilities respond more to movements in VIX
in their loan pricing and also in loan issuances. During periods of low VIX, high non-core banks
decrease their borrowing rates more. The estimated coefficient on the interaction between VIX and
the non-core dummy is 0.013 when including firm×quarter effects in column (2), which is almost as
large as the estimated elasticity of 0.019 between the interest rate and VIX in the macro regression
of Table 8. Therefore, the relative differential in changes in interest rates for high non-core banks
given movements in the GFC is economically large, and high non-core banks are responsible for a
significant part of the aggregate effect.
We further run the interaction regression including VIX on its own without firm×quarter ef26

We have also run regressions allowing for the slope on the trend variable to be heterogeneous across groups and
results are robust.

26

fect to recover the VIX-only coefficient in column (1). In this case, the estimated coefficient on
VIX is slightly lower (0.015) than the one in the macro regressions, while the coefficient on the
interaction between the non-core dummy and VIX is almost the same (0.015) as in the regression
with firm×quarter effects. Given this regression, the estimated interest rate-VIX elasticity for high
non-core banks is double (0.015 + 0.015 = 0.03) that of low non-core banks (0.015). We can use the
estimated coefficients for the loan volume regressions and the aggregation accounting exercise as
described in Appendix A.1 to gauge the importance of high non-core banks in explaining aggregate
credit growth over the sample period. Specifically, we take the ratio of the calculated average aggregate loan growth using the coefficients for VIX and the interacted non-core coefficient for high
non-core banks to the average aggregate loan growth calculated for all banks, and find this ratio
to be 0.95.27
We have also investigated the cyclical properties of potential changing firm-bank relationships
across the low and high non-core banks to ensure that our results are not driven by selection bias.
To do so, we calculate the net count of these relationships each period, where a negative count
means relatively more relationships of a given firm with low non-core than high non-core banks
as a ratio of total relationships. First, it is interesting to note that the ratio is always negative,
which implies that on average firms tend to have more relationships with low non-core banks, where
the ratio gets more negative over time. Second, there is some correlation between the ratio and
log(VIX) over time, but this cyclicality is mainly driven by Turkish lira loans. Furthermore, the
correlation is slightly negative, which would imply that during boom times (i.e., low VIX), firms
tend to form more relationships with high non-core banks. If anything, this could bias our results
towards zero, as more firms borrowing from high non-core banks would also imply a greater chance
of low-quality firms asking for loans, and thus high non-core banks would tend to charge higher,
not lower interest rates during boom periods, which may imply why the point estimate of the
interaction term in column (3) increases slightly once we control for firm×quarter effects.
To summarize, internationally exposed banks (as proxied by the high levels of non-core liability
27

This number drops to approximately 0.86 if we use the (smaller) sample that contains only multiple firm-bank
observations, as in column (4) of Table 9. Table A8 presents regressions where we define non-core dummies based
on the quartiles of the non-core distribution, where banks with larger non-core ratios appear in higher quartiles. We
define the quartile dummies by first computing the average non-core ratios for banks over the time series and then
compare these values to the different percentiles of the overall distribution across banks and over time. We include
the interaction of log(VIX) with dummy variables denoting the second, third, and fourth quartiles (Q2, Q3, and Q4,
respectively), where the first quartile interaction and quartiles dummies are dropped given collinearity. Notably, the
Q3 and Q4 interactions are significant, with the Q4 interaction coefficient being significantly larger (in absolute value)
for both the interest rate and loan regressions. These results are not surprising given that the non-core distribution
is skewed across banks.

ratio) play a dominant role in explaining our overall aggregate results. This result combined with the
fact that we are able to control for time-varying firm characteristics including firms’ credit demand
and credit risk in these specifications gives us further confidence that the macro regressions above
are capturing the causal impact of GFC on the domestic credit market.

4.3

Fact 3: UIP Regressions

In the previous tables, we have shown that FX loans have a large price differential over local
currency loans, where the size of this price differential is 7 percentage points on average, as given
by the estimated coefficient on the FX dummy. We next ask whether this price differential also
moves with the GFC using a difference-in-differences regression setting. We run the following for
regression for interest rates and loan volumes:
log Yf,b,d,q = αf,b,q + ρ(FXf,b,d,q × log VIXq−1 ) + δFXf,b,d,q + uf,b,d,q .

(3)

Table 10 presents the results for these regressions, where we include the following time-varying
fixed effects on top of firm×bank in order from column (1) to column (4): no time effects (columns
1 and 2), firm×quarter, and firm×bank×quarter.28 First, in looking at panel A, in all the specifications, the average price differential between FX and local currency loans remains at 7 percentage point when evaluated at the sample mean of log(VIX). More interestingly, during high-VIX
episodes, this differential gets larger, where FX loans are 8 percentage points cheaper during high
VIX episodes, whereas they are only 6 percentage points cheaper during low VIX episodes based
on the interquartile range of log(VIX). This result implies that local currency borrowing becomes
relatively cheaper during low VIX episodes relative to the average differential between FX and local
currency loans.
However, in looking at column (3) and (4) of panel A, we also see that the average effect of
FX becomes less significant. First, when we control for time-varying firm demand and risk via
firm×quarter effects in column (3), the significance of the FX coefficient drops to 10%. Next,
when we include bank×firm×quarter effects in column (4), the coefficients become insignificant.
The cyclical effect captured by the variable FX×log(VIX) becomes borderline significant. This
specification in column (4) reduces the sample size considerably given that identification of the FX
coefficients is now only coming from firm-bank pairs that borrow in multiple currencies in a given
28

It is important to note that while we use loans of differing maturities in these regressions, estimation based on
loans with a maturity of only twelve months deliver similar results – see Table A9.

quarter. That is, for the same firm borrowing from the same bank over time in different currencies,
there is no UIP deviation. These fixed effects also control for both bank and firm time-varying
risk, bank heterogeneity in access to finance, supply/demand, as well as any time time-varying
unobserved heterogeneity, like firm-bank matching being non-random over the cycle.
Although this sample is restrictive, it is the ideal sample to test for UIP at the micro level.
In theory, it is possible that a given firm can default on its FX loan obligations and not on its
Turkish lira loans upon a depreciation of the Turkish lira. In the data, it seems to be the case that
a given bank does not price this risk differentially at the loan level for a given firm over time. This
result shows the critical role of firm risk and bank heterogeneity that are both controlled in this
specification.
The loan volume results in panel B differ from the interest rate regressions. In particular, while
the FX coefficient remains significant throughout, indicating the fact that loans in foreign currency
are in larger amounts on average, the interaction of FX and log(VIX) is insignificant throughout.
This is surprising since one might expect that firms would take advantage of relatively lower rates
on TRY loans during the boom phase of the GFC and increase their Turkish lira borrowing.
One potential explanation for this fact is the following: during the boom phase of the GFC,
Turkish banks are able to more cheaply fund themselves in dollars/euros and therefore would have
an incentive to increase lending in FX. At the same time, as we show above, there is a falling risk
premium on the Turkish lira, which implies that banks can offer TRY loans with better terms.
Thus, banks also have an incentive to increase lending in domestic currency. After drilling down to
the micro data, our results show that these two effects offset each other so that the loan composition
does not change at the firm-bank level over the GFC.
In the aggregate data, however, we observe that the share of foreign currency loans falls and
the share of Turkish lira loans rises during the boom phase of GFC and vice versa as Turkish lira
loans become cheaper, consistent with a declining UIP risk premium. The comovement of the FX
share and the GFC is shown in Figure 8a, which plots the detrended share of FX loans together
with log(VIX). This relationship does not appear in our micro estimates in Table 10, but can be
rationalized in the aggregate. Although the two offsetting effects we mention above – Turkish banks
borrowing in FX and lending in FX and also lending in TRY due to declining UIP risk premium
– are both present in the aggregate data, there are also firms who borrow only in local currency
in the aggregate data. These firms make up 63% of the sample. In the difference-in-differences
regressions that use the FX dummy to identify the differential pricing and amounts, these firms will

not provide any information to identify a differential effect over the cycle since they always borrow
only in one currency. In fact, if we plot the level of FX share of loans (instead of detrended), as
shown in Figure 8b, this share declines over time during our sample period since most of our sample
period coincides with the boom phase of the GFC, where borrowing in TRY was cheaper for the
average firm.
To understand what type of bank heterogeneity is driving the UIP deviations, we run another
difference-in-differences regression. In Table 11 we interact the FX dummy with a dummy that
differentiates between high and low non-core banks to see the role played by bank heterogeneity.
We see that high non-core banks play a key role in the differential pricing of FX and Turkish lira
loans. These banks price FX loans higher during low VIX periods and lower during high VIX
periods, driving the UIP deviations at the firm and loan levels. The differential pricing by non-core
banks again disappears when we focus on the within variation for the same bank-same firm pair
in the last column of this table. When we calculate the total effect of the FX dummy and/or
the non-core variable, we again find the quantitative importance of non-core banks in differential
pricing and supply of credit as before. Overall, these results suggest that what is important is
bank heterogeneity in terms of access to international funding as differential pricing comes from
the variation in non-core liabilities.
Consistent with the findings on differential pricing, panel B shows that high non-core banks

supply less FX loans during boom periods of the GFC (low VIX) and supply more FX loans
during busts. Notice that this effect is estimated by the FX×Non-core×log(VIX) variable, and
the coefficient’s sign inverts in the last column once we control for firm and bank time-varying
heterogeneity, which allows us to focus on the same firm-bank pair. As we have already shown, there
is no differential pricing between FX and TRY loans in this unique sub-sample. And in this sample,
a bank supplying more FX loans to a firm during booms – even in the absence of differential pricing –
is natural as the high non-core banks tap international markets for FX currency. For the total effects
our results from the general sample and the unique sample are similar. Total effects are calculated
using estimates from both FX×Non-core×log(VIX) and FX×Non-core, when we evaluate the total
effect in moving from the 75th to 25th percentile of log(VIX) (i.e., capturing a boom period). These
regressions also demonstrate the importance of the cyclicality in the differential loan pricing that
comoves with VIX. If we focus only on the average effect estimated from FX×Non-core, we see
that non-core banks supply less FX loans when time-varying firm and bank heterogeneity are not
controlled for and they supply more FX loans when we account for such heterogeneity. Clearly
the former result is spurious as it captures the credit demand effect, since during booms when
firms’ demand for credit increases, there will be more demand for local currency credit, creating a
spurious negative correlation with the supply of FX credit. Once these effects are controlled for,
we find that high non-core banks supply more FX credit during normal times (on average) as they
fund themselves in FX in the international capital markets. This normal time finding combined
with our novel finding that non-core banks supply more TRY loans relative to FX loans during the
boom phase of the GFC has important policy implications that we discuss in the conclusion.

4.4

Risk-Taking Channels

Before moving on to studying the collateral channel at the loan level, that is our Fact 4, we consider
other possible channels through which the GFC may impact domestic credit market conditions,
focusing on potential risk-taking by banks.
Risk-taking channel: maturity transformation
The first set of regressions, presented in Table 12, examines whether high non-core banks affect
lending conditions via some form of maturity transformation. In particular, we augment our baseline
non-core regression specification (2) with a further interaction with a dummy variable based on the
maturity of loans, called ST. This variable is assigned value of 1 if loans mature in less than one

the natural logarithm of one plus the weighted-average of nominal interest rates for loans between a firm-bank as the
dependent variable. Panel B uses the natural logarithm of total loans between a firm-bank as the dependent variable.
VIX is the lagged quarterly average. NonCore is a 0/1 dummy indicating whether a bank is in the “low” ( = 0) or
“high” ( = 1) bin of banks defined by their average non-core liabilities ratio over the sample period. FX is a 0/1

and time trend of Table 8 are included in columns (1)-(2) when firm×quarter effects are excluded, and the bank-level
characteristics of Table 8 are included in columns (1)-(3) when bank×quarter effects are excluded . Regressions are
all weighted-least square, where weights are equal to the time-series average of the log of the bank’s total assets, and

year, and a zero otherwise. Given that we are interested in investigating maturity transformation,
we construct firm-bank-quarter measures of interest rates and loan volumes based only on new loan
issuances over a given quarter rather than using the stock of all existing loans like all the regressions
we have run. This is important as maturity at origination is the key variable to understand whether
or not there is any maturity transformation over the GFC.
Table 12 presents two specifications in panels A and B: one with only bank×firm fixed effects,
and then one augmented with firm×quarter fixed effects. First, in looking at the coefficients on ST

33

in columns (1) and (3), we see that short-term loans have higher interest rates and are smaller on
average. However, these differentials disappear once controlling for the time-varying firm-level fixed
effects in columns (2) and (4), as these effects pick up firm risk. More interestingly, we next focus
on the potential of maturity transformation over the cycle by looking at the differential impacts
in loan growth in panel B. In particular, regardless of the specification, we see that high non-core
banks issue less short-term loans on average than low non-core banks (the Non-core×ST coefficient
is negative), and that this differential becomes larger during boom phases of the GFC: a positive
coefficient on the Non-core×ST×log(VIX) variable implies that when VIX falls, high non-core banks
provide even less short-term loans (or more short-term loans during high VIX episodes). This result
can be interpreted that high non-core banks take more “risk” by providing more long-term loans
during the boom phase of GFC as such loans entail higher default risk. Notice that, in terms of
pricing, high non-core banks offer lower rates for loans of any maturity, which is why there is not
any differential price effect between short-term and long-term loans.
Risk-taking channel: leverage and size
The role of bank heterogeneity in driving aggregate credit market conditions has recently been
shown to be important in the closed-economy literature by Coimbra and Rey (2017), who show
how this heterogeneity plays a role in driving credit cycles via a risk-taking channel. Their model
emphasizes that heterogeneity in bank leverage can create systemic risk when there is a funding cost
shock to banks. We therefore also run horse race regressions including banks’ non-core and leverage
ratios, as well as bank size, interacted with log(VIX) in Table 13 for interest rates (Panel A) and
loan volumes (Panel B), including firm×quarter fixed effects. The leverage and size variables are
based on dummy variables, where like the non-core dummy, we define low and high groups based
on banks’ average of these variables relative to the sample median of each variable.
First, columns (1) and (4) include the non-core and leverage variables together and show that the
non-core interaction remains strongly significant while the leverage ratio interaction is insignificant.
Second, columns (2) and (5) include the non-core and bank size variables together and show that
the non-core coefficients remain significant. The size interaction is also significant and indicates that
larger banks decreasing lending rates more than smaller banks during low VIX periods (column 2),
and offer larger loans during these periods as well (column 5).29 Finally, columns (3) and (6) includes
all three bank variables interacted with log(VIX). The results are similar to the other estimation
29

The bank size-loan volume result is consistent with results in Baskaya et al. (2017).

insignificant. The robustness of the non-core results points to a new source of heterogeneity to
consider for open-economy models. In particular, these set of results are consistent with the risk-

taking channel via the decline in funding costs relaxing banks specific financing constraints, where
differences in banks’ risk-taking behavior are captured by levels of non-core liabilities, and not just
solely leverage or size.
Risk-taking channel: the exchange rate
Finally, we explore the possibility that the risk-taking channel works via an international price
channel, whereby fluctuations in the exchange rate affect the net worth of borrowers and relax the
leverage constraint of lenders (e.g., Bruno and Shin, 2015b). In particular, an appreciation of the

36

domestic currency vis-à-vis the USD improves domestic firms’ balance sheets, allowing lenders to
lend more to these borrowers.30
The mechanism is relevant for domestic firms who have debt in U.S. dollars since the shock is
on the nominal exchange rate. We control for exchange rate fluctuations in our regressions, but
there might still be an interaction effect where such fluctuations affect certain banks and firms as
envisioned by the models. Although these models have firms directly borrowing from global banks,
we can still test for this possible channel in our setup where firms borrow from domestic banks,
which in turn borrow from international markets, since firms can also borrow in foreign currency
from domestic banks.31
We run a triple interaction specification, which interacts a dummy variable indicating whether
a bank is either a low or a high leverage bank on average throughout the sample with a measure
of the FX share of a firm’s liabilities, and (i) the log change of the Turkish lira-US dollar exchange
rate, or (ii) a dummy variable for a depreciation episode of the lira viz. the US dollar, or (iii) a
dummy variable for an appreciation episode of the lira viz. the US dollar.32
Since the firm-level balance sheet data are not broken down by currency, we construct a proxy
for the FX share using the currency composition of firms’ loans in the credit register. In particular,
we calculate the FX share of loans for each firm over the sample, and divide firms into low and
high FX share bins, based on the median in the whole sample of firms. Therefore, a firm with an
average FX share of loans higher than the sample median is assigned a one, while a firm with a
lower share is assigned a zero.
Table 14 presents results for these regressions using quarterly data, where we use aggregate loans
for a given firm-bank pair in a quarter as in our benchmark regressions. We present specifications
that control for both firm×quarter and bank×quarter effects. Panel A presents results for the
nominal interest rate, and panel B for loan volumes. Looking across all specifications we never
see a significant coefficient. Therefore, the exchange rate risk-taking channel cannot explain the
reduction in borrowing costs and increased lending we have seen in our above regressions. One
potential reason for this non-result is the fact that the changes in the exchange rate were not very
large during our sample period.
30

The mechanism can also work via lender’s balance sheet by increasing lending capacity. However, in our case,
there is no currency mismatch on Turkish banks’ balance sheets.
31
As discussed above, Turkish corporate borrowing from foreign banks inside or outside the country and firms’
direct external bond issuance are minimal.
32
A depreciation period is one where the exchange rate change is in the top quartile of the distribution over the
sample. An appreciation period is one where the exchange rate change is in the bottom quartile of the distribution
over the sample.

Fact 4: Collateral Regressions

We want to understand how financial constraints relax during the boom phase of the GFC and
tighten during the bust. In our data, we observe the posted collateral so rather than proxying for
financial constraints by a firm’s net worth as is common in the literature,33 we can use the actual
collateral posted for a loan at its issuance, and measure whether its relationship with loan pricing
and volume moves with the GFC. The collateral measure also helps us to link our results to the
theoretical literature on firm heterogeneity and collateral constraints.
We estimate a loan-level version of our previous regressions using monthly data on new loan
33

See Cooley et al. (2004); Khan and Thomas (2013); Gopinath et al. (2017), for example.

38

originations. These regressions allow us to control for all time-varying heterogeneity at the bank
and firm levels, including the possibility of a non-random match between firms and banks with the
help of firm×bank×month fixed effects. The regression specification is
log Yf,b,l,m = %f,b,m + β1 Collateralf,b,l,m + β2 (Collateralf,b,l,m × log VIXm−1 )

(4)

+ β3 FXf,b,l,m + ef,b,l,m ,
where we change the q subscript to m for variables that vary at a monthly level, and focus on both
loan volume and the interest rate as the endogenous variables for a given loan l. Collateralf,b,l,m
measures the collateral-to-loan ratio at the initiation of the loan, and %f,b,m is a firm×bank×month
effect that captures time-varying firm and bank-level unobserved factors at the monthly level.
Notice that with these fixed effects, we solely identify from changes in the amount of new loans and
their interest rates for a given firm-bank pair. Hence, in our most stringent specification, we do
not allow firms to switch banks and vice versa for banks. This helps assuage the concern of biased
results due to time-varying selection effects at the firm-bank level. Since we use data on new loan
issuances to run these regressions, we only see each loan once and thus exploit changes in rates and
volume of each new loan from month to month to identify the impact of loan riskiness/collateral,
conditional on all other time-varying firm and bank factors.
Table 15 presents our results, where we first demean both the collateral ratio and log(VIX)
before running the regressions. As shown in panel A, the collateral ratio coefficient is significant
and has a negative sign in all columns; that is, there is a negative relationship between the collateral
ratio and the price of a loan. To the best of our knowledge, although there are theories that predict
a negative relation between posted collateral and the loan rate,34 our paper is the first to provide
evidence on this relationship. It is also interesting to note that this relationship does not vary with
VIX once we control for the unobserved time-varying firm-bank effects in columns (4). In other
words, once we focus on the same firm borrowing from the same bank over time, the relationship
between the collateral posted and a loan’s interest rate does not respond to the GFC, as proxied
by movements in log(VIX).
In panel B, we investigate whether or not collateral constraints relax during episodes of low
VIX-high capital inflows. We find no significant relationship between the collateral-to-loan ratio
and loan volumes in all columns. Furthermore, we also find no relationship between collateral ratio
and credit volumes during high and low VIX episodes. These results suggest that credit growth
34

See for example Fostel and Geanakoplos (2015).

39

during low VIX episodes is driven by low interest rates, regardless of collateral values.
To test whether or not credit growth is mainly driven by lower rates or higher collateral values,
we regress loan volumes on both interest rates and posted collateral in the same regression. This
regression allows us to examine the correlation between loan volumes, interest rates and the collateral ratio jointly. Table 16 presents these results. The coefficient on the interest rate is negative
and strongly significant, as we would expect given previous results if the loan growth is being driven
by supply-driven GFC capital inflows and a fall in the risk premium faced by domestic banks, and
which is passed on to firms. Meanwhile, the coefficient on the collateral ratio is never significant
once we control for time-varying firm-level fixed effects.

Conclusion

The results in this paper provide evidence on an important (yet overlooked) transmission mechanism
for domestic regulators to consider when designing macro prudential policies to slow down credit
growth during episodes of capital inflows: it is not enough to limit the foreign currency borrowing
for agents in an economy by imposing a capital control. Lower borrowing costs also fuel local
currency borrowing if domestic banks can fund themselves cheaply in the international financial
markets. Furthermore, lower borrowing costs can drive a credit boom in spite of the collateral
constraints staying intact during capital inflow bonanzas.
Our result on collateral constraints being insensitive to the GFC sheds light on the need for
new macro models. The traditional macro-finance model perspective, in an international setting,
is one where external shocks affect the collateral constraint and propagate to the economy. Our
evidence shows that external shocks affect risk premia, and which then propagate to the economy

42

by-passing collateral constraints. This finding requires another class of models that highlight the
role of risk premia – and how they may vary at the micro level – to study the transmission of both
domestic and international financial shocks.

Aggregate Implications of Reduced-Form Regressions

There is a natural aggregation exercise to undertake to examine the economic significance of our
micro estimates on overall credit growth. In particular, ignoring the other control variables and
intercept coefficients (i.e., fixed effects), we can write the VIX-predicted Loan variable from estimating (1) as
\
b
log(Loan
f,b,d,q ) = β log(VIXq−1 ),

(A.1)

where βb is the estimated coefficient. First, differentiate both sides of (A.1), and then multiply this
equation by wf,b,d,q−1 , which is a firm-bank-denomination loan share viz. total loans in a given
P
lagged quarter, such that
wf,b,d,q−1 = 1 by definition. These manipulations yield
\
b
wf,b,d,q−1 dlog(Loan
f,b,d,q ) = wf,b,d,q−1 βd log(VIXq−1 ),

VIX variable and the estimated micro estimate β.
A.1.1

Importance of Internationally Connected Banks

To quantify the importance of large internationally connected banks in transmitting the GFC to
the domestic credit market, we use the point estimates from Table 9, column (3), which is based on
regression specification (2) where we drop the firm×quarter fixed effects, and use macro controls
instead.35 Ignoring these controls and the bank controls for brevity, the regression equation can be
35

Note that the point estimates on the interaction between the non-core ratio and log(VIX) with and without fixed
effects in columns (3) and (4) are not statistically different.

summarized as:
log Yf,b,d,q = αf,b + λTrendq + β1 VIXq−1 + β2 (Noncoreb × log VIXq−1 ) + ϑf,b,d,q .
Given the estimates of β1 and β2 , we then follow the same procedure as for the macro regression
above, based on weights for high non-core banks (HN C) and low non-core banks (LN C). To begin,
we predict individual loan growths based on bank type and weight these growth rates:

= wf,b,d,q−1 (β1 + β2 )
+ wf,b,d,q−1 β1

VIX q−1
We next sum over the {f, b, d} in a given quarter q:

to obtain the aggregate quarterly growth rate. We then repeat this aggregation using only the
HN C bank sample, and take the average of this HN C growth rate over the sample to the average
of the overall aggregate growth rate:

This ratio is equal to 0.95, thus highlighting the important contribution of internationally connected
banks in transmitting the GFC to domestic credit market growth.36

36
If we instead use the non-core interaction coefficient estimate for βb2 and firm-bank sample from column (4) for
the fixed effects regression, the ratio drops to 0.86, which is still economically large.

Notes: This table presents summary statistics for quarterly Turkish and world macroeconomic and financial data.
All real variables are deflated using 2003 as the base year. Turkish macroeconomic data are sourced from the CBRT.
Turkish real GDP growth, inflation, and exchange rate changes viz. the USD are all quarter-on-quarter. The VIX
and the CBRT overnight rate are quarterly averages. ‘IQR’ stands for the interquartile range. Turkish capital inflows
are in real Turkish lira. The CA/GDP variable measures the quarterly Turkish current account relative to GDP,
while log(Capital inflows) is the natural logarithm of gross real capital inflows into Turkey in 2003 TRY.

Notes: This table presents results for the OLS regressions including monetary policy shocks using quarterly data
for all loans. Panel A uses the natural logarithm of one plus the weighted-average of nominal interest rates for loans
between a firm-bank as the dependent variable. Panel B uses the natural logarithm of total loans between a firm-bank
as the dependent variable. VIX is the lagged quarterly average. MP is a monetary policy shock based on current
future contracts, FF4 is a monetary policy shocks based on future contracts that are 3-months out. FX is a 0/1
dummy indicating whether a loan is in foreign currency ( = 1) or domestic ( = 0). Regressions are all weighted-least
square, where weights are equal to the time-series average of the log of the bank’s total assets, and standard errors
are double clustered at the firm and quarter levels, and ∗∗∗ indicates significance at the 1% level, ∗∗ at the 5% level,

checks are: (i) using the risk aversion component of VIX as extracted by Bekaert et al. (2013) – we would like to thank
Marie Horoeva for providing us with an updated series; (ii) using short-term maturity (one year or less) loans; (iii)
using long-term maturity (more than one year); (iv) dropping the crisis period from the regressions; (v) restricting
the sample to firm-bank pairs for private banks only. Regressions are all weighted-least square, where weights are
equal to the time-series average of the log of the bank’s total assets, and standard errors are double clustered at the
firm and quarter levels, and ∗∗∗ indicates significance at the 1% level, ∗∗ at the 5% level, and ∗ at the 10% level.

Notes: This table presents results for the OLS regressions for (2) using quarterly data for all loans. Panel A uses
the natural logarithm of one plus the weighted-average of nominal interest rates for loans between a firm-bank as the
dependent variable. Panel B uses the natural logarithm of total loans between a firm-bank as the dependent variable.
VIX is the lagged quarterly average. Non-core Q2-Q4 is a 0/1 dummy indicating whether a bank is in the second,
third, or fourth interquartile range bin of banks defined by their average non-core liabilities ratio over the sample
period, where a higher quartile indicates a larger ratio. FX is a 0/1 dummy indicating whether a loan is in foreign
currency ( = 1) or domestic ( = 0), and firm×quarter effects are included in all specifications. Regressions are all
weighted-least square, where weights are equal to the time-series average of the log of the bank’s total assets, and
standard errors are double clustered at the firm and quarter levels, and ∗∗∗ indicates significance at the 1% level, ∗∗
at the 5% level, and ∗ at the 10% level.

Notes: This table presents results for the OLS regressions for (3) using quarterly data for loans having only 12months maturity. Panel A uses the natural logarithm of one plus the weighted-average of nominal interest rates for
loans between a firm-bank as the dependent variable. Panel B uses the natural logarithm of total loans between a
firm-bank as the dependent variable. VIX is the lagged quarterly average. FX is a 0/1 dummy indicating whether
a loan is in foreign currency ( = 1) or domestic ( = 0), and the macroeconomic controls and time trend of Table 8
are included in columns (1)-(2) when firm×quarter effects are excluded, and the bank-level characteristics of Table 8
are included in columns (1)-(3) when bank×quarter effects are excluded . Regressions are all weighted-least square,
where weights are equal to the time-series average of the log of the bank’s total assets, and standard errors are double
clustered at the firm and quarter levels, and ∗∗∗ indicates significance at the 1% level, ∗∗ at the 5% level, and ∗ at
the 10% level.
