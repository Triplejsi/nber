Macroeconomic Conditions and Opioid Abuse

NBER Working Paper No. 23192
February 2017, Revised March 2017
JEL No. I1,I12,I15
ABSTRACT
We examine how deaths and emergency department (ED) visits related to use of opioid
analgesics (opioids) and other drugs vary with macroeconomic conditions. As the county
unemployment rate increases by one percentage point, the opioid death rate per 100,000 rises by
0.19 (3.6%) and the opioid overdose ED visit rate per 100,000 increases by 0.95 (7.0%).
Macroeconomic shocks also increase the overall drug death rate, but this increase is driven by
rising opioid deaths. Our findings hold when performing a state-level analysis, rather than
county-level; are primarily driven by adverse events among whites; and are stable across time
periods.

Introduction
Covering a variety of countries and time periods, voluminous research conducted over the

last two decades indicates that physical health improves when economic conditions temporarily
deteriorate.1 In the case of mental health, however, research shows apparent declines during
periods of economic weakness (Ruhm, 2000; Ruhm, 2003; Charles & DeCicca, 2008; and Modrek
et al., 2015). Some evidence suggests, moreover, that the procyclicality of physical health has
declined considerably in recent years (Stevens et al., 2015; McInerney and Mellor, 2012; Lam and
Piérard, 2015; Ruhm, 2015) just as drug poisoning deaths, often involving opioid analgesics
(henceforth opioids) such as hydrocodone and oxycodone, have trended sharply upwards (Rudd et
al., 2016).2
Understanding the relationship between local economic conditions and drug-related
adverse outcomes is important because the United States is “experiencing an epidemic of drug
overdose (poisoning) deaths” (Rudd et al., 2016, p. 1378), with fatal drug poisonings increasing
by 146% from 1999 to 2014 (Figure 1). Poisoning deaths, around 90% of which are now caused
by drugs (Warner et al., 2011), were the most important source of growth in the all-cause mortality
rates of 45-54 year old non-Hispanic whites between 1999 and 2013 (Case and Deaton, 2015). The
involvement of opioids and, more recently, heroin in these deaths has received particular attention
(Volkow et al., 2014; Jones et al. 2015; and Rudd et al., 2016), including a White House Summit
in August 2014 (Hardesty, 2014). Drug poisoning deaths are higher for males than females, but
have been rising rapidly over time for both sexes, as well as for almost all age groups, but

1

This literature often dates from Ruhm (2000)’s study of the US for the 1972-1991 period. However, there are
indications that mortality was procyclical in research from as early as the 1920s (Ogburn & Thomas, 1922).
2
Heroin is classified as a separate category of narcotics. Heroin deaths have risen extremely rapidly since 2010 but
were relatively stable before that (Ruhm, 2017). This increase is too recent to be adequately captured in our study’s
timeframe.

particularly rapidly for 25-64 year olds (Ruhm, 2017). One notable feature is that non-Hispanic
white (hereafter simply “white”) and non-Hispanic black (hereafter “black”) drug fatality rates
closely tracked each other during the 1980s and 1990s, but since 1999 (the period examined here),
white mortality rates have grown much faster. Figure 2 illustrates this divergence. From 1999 to
2014 the U.S. white drug death rate per 100,000 grew by 203%, while the black and Hispanic drug
death rates increased by 49% and 31%, respectively. Rising deaths are not the only indication of
serious health consequences related to the growing use of opioids. Emergency department (ED)
visits involving narcotic pain relievers increased 117% between 2005 and 2011 (Crane, 2015) and
opioid-related ED visits grew by 39.5% from 2006 to 2014 (see Figure 3). While this rise has
mostly occurred among prime-aged adults, all age groups have seen an increase in the risk of
opioid poisoning ED visits (Tadros et al., 2016).
This analysis examines how serious adverse health outcomes related to opioid and other
drugs vary with short-term fluctuations in macroeconomic conditions. Specifically, we study how
deaths and ED visits due to opioids and other drugs are related to local unemployment rates. Our
main findings are that opioid deaths and ED visits are predicted to rise when county unemployment
rates temporarily increase. The same is true for all sources of drug poisoning mortality, and
consistent results are obtained when performing the analysis at the state-level rather than the
county-level, proxying for macroeconomic conditions with employment-to-population ratios
rather than unemployment rates, and conducting a variety of other robustness and sensitivity
checks. Importantly, our findings are relatively stable regardless of the time period considered,
indicating that they represent a general connection between economic conditions and severe
adverse consequences of substance abuse that is not restricted to periods of recession. Moreover,

our results are predominantly driven by changes among whites (rather than blacks or Hispanics)
in most specifications.
II.

Prior Research and Contribution of this Investigation
The vast literature examining the connection between economic fluctuations and health has

considered effects on mortality and morbidity, health-related behaviors, health insurance and
health care use.3 Mortality has been found to be procyclical in investigations covering a wide
variety of countries and time periods (e.g. Ruhm, 2000; Neumayer, 2004; Tapia Granados, 2005;
Gerdtham & Ruhm, 2006; Buchmueller et al., 2007; Lin, 2009; Gonzalez & Quast, 2011; and
Ariizumi & Schirle, 2012). Similarly, many (though not all) studies suggest that lifestyle factors
such as exercise, obesity, smoking and heavy drinking improve in bad economic times (e.g. see
Freeman, 1999; Ruhm & Black, 2002; Ruhm, 2005; Gruber & Frakes, 2006; and Xu, 2013).4
However, some current research suggests that these patterns have weakened or reversed in recent
years for both mortality (McInerney & Mellor, 2012; Stevens et al., 2015; Lam & Piérard, 2015;
and Ruhm, 2015) and health behaviors (Dávalos et al., 2012; Colman & Dave, 2013; and Tekin et
al., 2013).
Particularly relevant to the current analysis is suggestive evidence, provided by Ruhm
(2015), that one of the main reasons deaths shifted from being sharply procyclical to acyclical or
countercyclical in recent years is because poisoning fatalities have been rapidly increasing and
now exhibit a strong countercyclical pattern. However, the precision of these estimates is low and
the analysis did not separately examine drug (rather than more general poisoning) fatalities or the
involvement of specific drugs, such as opioids.5

See Ruhm (2012) for a review of much of this research.
However, there are exceptions (e.g. Dee, 2001; and Johansson et al., 2006).
5
More recently, Pierce & Schott (2016) provide evidence that accidental poisoning deaths rise when local economic
conditions deteriorate.

There has been substantial investigation of the relationship between macroeconomic
conditions and a variety of health behaviors – including drinking, smoking and exercise, as
discussed above – but corresponding effects on drug use have received less attention, largely
because of data limitations. Arkes (2007) provides evidence that teenage use of both marijuana
and harder (illicit) drugs rises in economic downturns. Using data from 2002-2013 and a broader
age range, Carpenter et al. (2016) find that such downturns are associated with increases in selfreported use of hallucinogens (particularly ecstasy) but with insignificant effects for most other
drugs, and with self-reported substance-use disorders related to analgesics (including opioid and
non-opioid forms) as well as hallucinogens. Whether these estimated effects are large enough to
result in higher rates of ED visits or deaths is unclear. Similarly, using survey data, Martin Bassols
and Vall Castelló (2016) find that in Spain, the Great Recession caused increases in the reported
use of both marijuana and cocaine. Frijters et al. (2013) show that internet searches for terms
related to alcohol abuse and treatment increase when economic conditions deteriorate. However,
Maclean, Cantor, and Pacula’s (2015) analysis of 1992-2010 data suggests that alcohol and illicit
drug admissions to (non-ED) substance abuse programs decrease in such periods. The exact
mechanisms driving this reduction are unclear, as the utilization of substance abuse programs
depends on both underlying health status and changes in the availability of treatment.6 If temporary
economic downturns simultaneously increase the demand for but lower access to treatment, the
net result might be a rise in both deaths and ED visits.
Our analysis extends beyond prior research by focusing on drug poisonings, which have
grown rapidly in the past fifteen years and are likely to be related to economic conditions in

6

For example, Cawley et al. (2015) show that increases in state unemployment rates during the 2004-2010 period
were associated with sharp decreases in health insurance coverage, especially for 50-64-year-old men and collegeeducated individuals.

different ways than other types of poisoning. Furthermore, we study the severe outcomes of ED
visits and deaths. While examining all types of drug overdoses, we pay particular attention to those
involving opioids. We do so because opioids comprise the majority of drug overdose deaths and
are quite possibly the most sensitive to macroeconomic conditions. For example, opioids were
estimated to be involved in 53% of fatal drug overdoses in 2014 and to play a role in 64% of the
increase in drug deaths occurring between 1999 and 2014 (Ruhm, 2017). Next most important was
heroin, which was estimated to be involved in 30% of 2014 drug fatalities. We do not focus on
heroin, however, because rates of deaths and ED visits were relatively low for most of our study
period (until 2010) after which they rose extremely rapidly.7
We separately examine the connection between economic conditions and severe adverse
drug outcomes for whites, blacks, and Hispanics. Differences across racial groups may be
important given recent evidence by Case and Deaton (2015) that mortality rates increased for 4554-year-old whites, even while rapidly decreasing for blacks and Hispanics. Although poisonings
are an important source of the observed changes in mortality rates, it is not obvious that the effects
of macroeconomic conditions on deaths or emergency department visits involving opioids
necessarily follow the same pattern. For instance, to the extent that minorities are more affected
by economic downturns, we might anticipate stronger patterns for nonwhites than whites. On the
other hand, drug deaths have increased more slowly for nonwhites than for whites since 1999
(Ruhm, 2017), which might predict a weaker relationship.
III.

Data and Descriptive Statistics

7

These statistics refer to any involvement of these drugs rather than the exclusive involvement of a particular drug.
The distinction is important because many drug poisoning deaths involve combinations of drug classes (e.g. 49% in
2014 according to Ruhm, 2017).

6

Mortality data come from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Multiple Cause
of Death (MCOD) files for 1999-2014, which provide information from the universe of death
certificates (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016). Mortality data are one of the few
health measures collected over a long time period and in a relatively comparable manner across
areas of the country. The MCOD provide information on a single underlying cause of death (UCD),
up to twenty additional causes, and basic demographics. Cause of death is categorized using a
four-digit International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code. Details are also
provided on place of residence, age, race/ethnicity, gender, year, and weekday of death. We
obtained a restricted-use version of the data with information on state and county of residence for
this study.
Drug poisoning deaths were defined using ICD-10 UCD codes, where the underlying cause
is the “disease or injury that initiated the chain of morbid events that led directly and inevitably to
death” (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014). Drug poisonings occur when the
underlying cause of death is X40-X44, X60-X64, X85, Y10-Y14, or Y35.2 (World Health
Organization, 2014). In cases of drug poisoning, the death certificate lists one or more drugs
involved as immediate or contributory causes of death. These are identified as ICD-10 cause of
death “T codes,” with opioids defined to be involved for T-codes 40.2-40.4 and heroin for T-code
40.1.8
Death certificate information tends to understate the involvement of opioids (and other
drug categories) because the type or types of drugs involved are left unspecified (ICD-10 code,
T50.9) in 20%-25% of fatal overdoses (Ruhm, 2017). To correct for this undercount, we follow
Ruhm (2017) and impute opioid involvement in cases where the death certificate indicated only

unspecified drugs. To do so, we estimated year-specific probit models on the sample of fatal
overdoses where at least one drug was specified. The dichotomous dependent variable was set to
one if opioids were mentioned and to zero if they were not. The explanatory variables included
dichotomous indicators for: sex, race (white, black, other nonwhite), Hispanic origin, currently
married, education (high school dropout, high school graduate, some college, college graduate),
age category (≤20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80, >80), day of the week of death (seven
dummy variables) and a vector of state fixed-effects. Next, we used the probit results to calculate
year-specific predicted probabilities of opioid-involvement for cases where no drug was specified
on the death certificate. We then calculated adjusted mortality rates using reported involvement
for deaths where at least one specific drug was mentioned and the imputed probabilities where no
drug was specified.9
There is no comprehensive national source of ED data comparable to the Mortality files.
ED data are only made available to researchers for specific states, who decide terms of access
individually. We have assembled what, to our knowledge, is the most comprehensive currently
available data on ED visits related to opioid and other drug use, covering 16 states in total. Our
main dataset consists of counts of ED visits occurring in a given county and year, aggregated from
microdata available for 5 states over some or all of the 2002-2014 period. We supplement this with
a collection of aggregated state-level data for 15 states available for all or a portion of the 20002013 period.
Our microdata come from the State Emergency Department Databases (SEDD) for five
states, assembled by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Healthcare Cost

9

Over the full time period (1999-2014), the overall drug mortality rate was 10.77 per 100,000. The opioid-involved
death rate without imputations was 4.04 per 100,000. The adjustments increased this by around one third, to 5.35 per
100,000. The same procedure was used to adjust estimates of heroin involvement.

and Utilization Project (HCUP).10 These were derived from uniform medical billings at the ED
visit level, but only for visits that did not result in an inpatient stay. By comparing this information
to available state-level aggregate data on both inpatient and outpatient ED visits, we determined
that our microdata contains one-half to two-thirds of all ED visits for opioid overdoses, depending
on the state and year.11 The ED visit microdata include information on patient characteristics,
diagnoses, procedures, and charges. Since the SEDD are not available for every year, and some
state files are prohibitively expensive, our micro data cover the following states and years: Arizona
(2005-2014), Kentucky (2008-2012), Florida (2005-2014), Maryland (2002-2012), and New
Jersey (2004, 2006-2103). To increase the geographical representation of our data, we also
obtained state-level aggregated ED visit records from the HCUPnet system (which provides a
click-through public-access system for these counts) for 15 states in select years. Specifically,
these include counts of ED visits (regardless of whether or not they subsequently resulted in an
inpatient admission) for the following states and years: Arizona (2005-2013), Florida (2005-2013),
Hawaii (2003-2010, 2013), Iowa (2004-2013), Illinois (2009-2013), Kentucky (2008-2013),
Maryland (2005-2013), Minnesota (2001-2013), North Carolina (2007-2013), Nebraska (20012013), New Hampshire (2003-2009), South Carolina (2005-2013, Tennessee (2005-2013), Utah
(2000-2011, 2013), and Vermont (2002-2013). The level of data available for each state and year
combination is displayed in Table 1.
Unlike the mortality data, which use ICD-10 codes to classify reason for death, the ED data
use ICD-9-CM codes. To ensure that our ED results are comparable to our mortality data, we used
a CDC crosswalk that links ICD-10 cause of death and ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for various

categories of drug poisoning (CDC 2013). In the ED data, drug poisonings corresponded to ICD9 codes 960.00 through 979.99;opioid overdoses to ICD-9 codes 965.00, 965.02, 965.09, E850.1,
and E850.2; and heroin overdoses to codes 965.01and E850.0.
Our county-level mortality data covered 3,138 counties over 16 years, with almost every
county reporting each year, yielding a maximum of 50,148 observations. When we examined
deaths among specific racial or ethnic groups, our sample size decreased as some counties had no
black or Hispanic residents.12 The county-level ED information (obtained from the microdata)
included 1,873 county-year observations from the 5 states in the SEDD sample. From 2005 to
2008, Arizona did not report patient race, so we omit Arizona from the ED analyses examining
race. In addition, we discovered inconsistency in the reporting of Hispanic ethnicity across states
and years, so were unable to separately estimate specifications for Hispanics using the ED data.13
Our state-level ED data contain 140 state-year cells for the 15 states providing aggregated ED visit
data.
We compiled additional data on county characteristics that we use either as right-hand side
control variables or to explore heterogeneity in the estimated effects. We obtained county
population data from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
Program (SEER) to turn counts of deaths or ED visits into rates per 100,000.14 In addition to the
full sample rates, we separately computed mortality and ED rates for whites and blacks, as well as
death (but not ED) rates for Hispanics. Information on county and state unemployment rates, our
main proxy for macroeconomic conditions, came from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Local Area
Unemployment Statistics (www.bls.gov/lau/lauov.htm). County level median incomes were

obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates
(www.census.gov/did/www/saipe/). Table 2 contains summary statistics for our county-level data.
Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between the unemployment rate, our primary proxy
for macroeconomic conditions, and death rates (per 100,000) from all drugs and from opioids.
Over the 1999-2014 period, 49.7% of drug deaths involved opioids, 17.1% involved heroin, and
38.7% involved only drugs other than heroin or opioids.15 All three rates have risen over time.16 At
this national level of aggregation, Figure 1 does not reveal an obvious relationship between the
economic climate and drug poisoning death rates. Although the average unemployment rate was
on the rise during this time period, drug-related mortality increased even when the national
unemployment rate decreased between recessions and especially during the steep decline in
unemployment after 2011. However, the strong upwards trend in drug mortality may conceal any
macroeconomic effects.
Figure 2 separates opioid mortality rates (the largest component of all drug deaths) by race,
and demonstrates that white opioid death rates have risen considerably (closely tracking the alldrug death rate) while the rates for blacks, and especially for Hispanics have been low and
relatively flat over this time period.
Figure 3 shows nationwide trends in ED visits (per 100,000) for opioid overdoses and all
drug poisonings from 2006 to 2014. Both series display a similar, increasing trend. From 2006 to
2014, the rate of opioid-related ED visits grew by 6.82 per 100,000 (39.50%) and the rate of all
drug-related ED visits rose by 13.70 per 100,000 (8.0%). These data come from the National
Emergency Department Sample (NEDS), a 20% sample of records from all participating states

15

These numbers sum to more than 100% because 2.6% of drug deaths involved the use of both opioids and heroin.
In 2014, the drug death rate per 100,000 was 14.76, of which 7.34 were opioid related, 4.05 involved heroin, and
4.25 involved only drugs other than opioids or heroin.

(but not containing state identifiers) disseminated through HCUP. The NEDS estimates are based
upon the entire set of SID and SEDD data and are weighted to be nationally representative. For
expositional clarity, we plot the national estimates based upon the NEDS here, rather than statelevel estimates based upon the SEDD data for the five states used in our analysis.17
Figure 3 also highlights a key distinction between the mortality and ED data. Opioid deaths
are responsible for roughly half of all drug deaths in any given year, but opioids ED visits account
for fewer than 14% of all drug-related ED visits. Breaking down drug-related ED visits further,
we find that eight drug categories constitute approximately 60% of the drug poisoning ED visits
in any given year: opioids, benzodiazepines, heroin, anti-depressants, aromatic analgesics (e.g.
acetaminophen), insulin, anti-psychotics, and cocaine. Figure 4 displays the nationwide ED visit
rate for each drug category from 2006 to 2014. While both opioid and heroin overdose ED rates
have risen since 2006, the rate of overdose visits to the ED for all other majority drug categories
remained constant or declined.18
The NEDS further allow us to determine the percentage of in-hospital deaths that occur
after an ED overdose visit for each drug type.19 Cocaine, heroin, and opioids are by far the deadliest
of the eight major drug categories, resulting in around two to three times more deaths per visit than
the other four top drug categories. For every one-hundred ED visits for cocaine poisoning there
are approximately 1.5 in-hospital deaths. Similarly, 1.4% of heroin and 1.2% of opioid overdose
ED visits result in an in-hospital death. The death rate associated with an ED visit for a

17

When a similar figure is created for each state, a clear relationship between the ED visit rate for opioids and for all
drugs is still present. However, some states in our sample do not exhibit strictly increasing trends over this time period.
As we only have data for 5 states for county-level ED visits, we verified that the mortality trends were similar for
these states as for the U.S. average. When we limit the mortality data from Fig 1 to these same 5 states: there is a 117
% increase in drug-related death rates and a larger (339%) rise in opioid deaths.
18
Similar figures created for each state using the micro-data display consistent results.

This includes all deaths that occur in the ED as well as all deaths that occur during any related inpatient stay
following an admission from the ED.

12

benzodiazepine overdose is roughly one-third as large or 0.4%. The weighted average death rate
of an ED visit for the remaining four categories (anti-depressants, aromatic analgesics, antipsychotics, and insulin) is <0.4%. One implication of these results is that the relationship between
overall drug-related ED visit and death rates may be quite weak, since many of the most important
sources of visits rarely result in death, whereas the relationship between opioid-related ED visits
and deaths may be considerably stronger.
IV.

Empirical Approach
We perform both a county and state-level analysis of the relationship between

macroeconomic conditions and adverse drug outcomes. We first describe the county-level analysis
and subsequently discuss the modifications required when using state data.
Our main regression specifications take the form:
!"# = &'"# + )" + *# + +,# + -"# ,

(1)

where the dependent variable, Yjt is the mortality or ED visit rate, per 100,000, in county j and year
t; Ujt, the county annual unemployment rate, is the main proxy for macroeconomic conditions. We
include county and year fixed-effects (ηj and .t) in all models, to control for potential confounding
factors that vary across counties but are fixed over time, as well as determinants of mortality or
ED visits that differ nationally across time, and we report results from these specifications in our
full sample analysis.
One concern is that local policies influencing drug mortality or ED visits could have
changed over time in ways that are spuriously correlated with unemployment rates. The most
important of these – such as prescription drug monitoring programs, recreational or medical
marijuana legalization, and Medicaid policies – occur at the state rather than county level (Rees et
al., 2017; Dowell et al., 2016; and Buchmueller and Carey, 2017). Therefore, our preferred

13

specifications also include state-by-year fixed effects (µst). In alternative specifications, we instead
include a vector of county-specific linear time trends.
Macroeconomic conditions may have worsened (or improved) in areas that for other
reasons were on different trajectories in terms of drug mortality. If so, a model with county, year
and state-by-year fixed effects could still incorrectly attribute a continuing pre-existing trend in
mortality to changes in unemployment rates. Theoretically, we could address this by
simultaneously controlling for both county-specific time trends and state-by-year fixed-effects.
However, doing so for every county in the United States would leave our model with virtually no
useful variation.20 We address this issue in section VII, when describing our robustness checks.
Several points about our preferred regression specification deserve mention. First, given
comprehensive controls for location and time-specific determinants, we generally do not include
additional supplementary covariates. Second, we use levels, rather than natural logs, as the
dependent variable. We do so because some counties (particularly smaller ones) will have zero
values for the dependent variables in at least some years.21 Third, we weight observations by
population, to obtain nationally representative treatment effects. Unweighted estimates would
overstate the influence of treatment effects in small counties. Fourth, the tables display robust
standard errors clustered at the county level, which is the level of variation for our key regressor,
the unemployment rate.
There are pros and cons to using counties, rather than larger geographic aggregates such as
states, as the unit of observation. On the one hand, there is likely to be more error in the

20

A regression of county unemployment rates over this time on a set of county FE, year FE, state by year FE and
county-specific linear time trends has an R2 of 0.96.
21
Prior related research (e.g. Ruhm, 2000) shows that comparable predicted effects are obtained using linear versus
log-linear specifications. An alternative would be to estimate zero-inflated negative binomial models, although the
interpretation of the coefficients in such specifications would be less transparent.

14

measurement of both mortality and unemployment rates for smaller geographic units.22 On the
other hand, counties within the same state could face different economic climates, and what
happens far away may not affect lives as much as what occurs nearby (e.g. in funding of public
health). However, a further question involves the level of geographic aggregation at which the
macroeconomic effects actually take place. In this regard, Lindo’s (2015) conclusion that more
disaggregated analyses often understate the extent to which downturns affect health is particularly
instructive. For our application, an additional advantage to using a broader level of geography is
that we only have ED visit data at the county level for 5 states, while we have state level data for
15. For these reasons, we provide a full replication of analysis at the state level. When doing so,
we are naturally no longer able to include state-by-year fixed effects and so we instead estimate
specifications with and without state-specific linear time trends, and include state and year fixed
effects in all specifications.
As mentioned, we also performed a series of robustness and sensitivity checks. These are
summarized in Section VII and detailed in the supplementary appendix.

County-Level Results
Table 3 shows three county-level specifications for our dependent variables of primary

interest: opioid-involved drug-related death rates, all drug-related mortality rates, opioid overdose
ED visit rates, and all drug overdose ED visit rates. The first column shows the specification with
only county and year fixed effects. The second column adds county specific time trends, while the
third instead includes state-by-year fixed-effects, and corresponds to Equation 1. We view the

22

The greater measurement error in county as opposed to state unemployment rates is well known (see for example
Ganong and Liebman, 2013). Errors in classifying county of residence at death have been less studied, but Pierce and
Denison (2006) provide evidence of substantial misrecording of counties using mortality data from Texas.

models in columns (2) and (3) as superior to column (1) because they better control for possible
confounding factors. However, we generally prefer models that include state-by-year fixed effects
since, as mentioned, many potential policy determinants are likely to vary across both time and
states, but less so across counties within states.
Turning to the primary findings in column (3) of the first panel for opioid-involved drugrelated deaths, the coefficient of 0.19 implies that a one percentage point rise in the county
unemployment rate is predicted to increase opioid fatalities by a statistically significant 0.19 per
100,000. This represents a 3.55 percent growth from the sample average of 5.35 per 100,000. A
one standard deviation change in the unemployment rate corresponds to 2.59 percentage points,
suggesting effect sizes of around a 0.49 per 100,000, or an 9.2 percent, increase in fatal opioid
overdoses. This also implies an unemployment rate elasticity of around 0.23.23
The estimated unemployment rate effect for all drug fatalities is also highly significant but
somewhat sensitive to the inclusion of state-year fixed-effects versus county-specific time trends.
In the preferred model (column 3), a one-point rise in unemployment predicts a 0.36 per 100,000
increase in drug mortality rates, corresponding to a 3.3 percent increase from the sample average
of 10.77 per 100,000, and an unemployment rate elasticity of around 0.21 Results from this
specification suggest that around half of the macroeconomic effect on drug mortality operates
through opioid-related deaths. We confirmed this by estimating our preferred specification where
the dependent variable was non-opioid related drug deaths. The unemployment coefficient is (a
statistically significant) 0.17, accounting for the remainder of the total effect. (Details are provided
in the supplementary appendix.) Conversely, in the model with county time trends, rather than
state-by-year fixed effects, the one-point rise in unemployment predicts a much smaller, 0.18 per

23

A one percentage point rise in unemployment represents a 15.65 percent increase from the sample mean rate of
6.39 percent, yielding an elasticity of 0.23 (3.55%/15.65%).

100,000, increase in the all drug death rate, which is then dominated by changes in fatalities
involving opioids.
The two lower panels of Table 3 show results for drug-related ED visits, rather than deaths.
Being restricted to selected county-year observations from five states, the samples are smaller,
leading us to anticipate less precise estimates. Nevertheless, we find that, as with mortality rates,
there is a strong and significant positive relationship between opioid-related overdose ED visits
and unemployment rates that is relatively robust across specifications. In the model with state-year
fixed-effects (column 3), a one percentage point rise in unemployment predicts a 0.95 per 100,000,
or 7.0 percent, increase in opioid overdose ED visits, corresponding to an elasticity of around 0.56.
The results for all drug-related ED visits are more sensitive to choice of specification, but
still suggestive of a countercyclical macroeconomic effect. In our preferred model, a one-point rise
in unemployment predicts a statistically insignificant 1.19 per 100,000, or 1.2 percent, increase in
drug-related ED visits. This imprecision of results is not unexpected since, as discussed above, a
large set of drugs cause individuals to seek ED care; however, many of these drugs relatively
infrequently result in death. One consequence is that opioid overdose ED visits reflect a small
share (13.9%) of all drug overdose ED visits, and it is unlikely that our analysis will have sufficient
statistical power to detect any plausible minimum effect size. Put differently, opioid overdose ED
visits would need to be implausibly sensitive to the unemployment rate for there to be statistically
significant effects of the unemployment rate in the large category of ‘all drug’ ED visits.24

24

To show this more formally, we conducted a simulated power analysis, where we estimated the minimum detectable
effect size across all power levels and for a range of type-I error thresholds. Following conventional standards, for
80% power and a 0.05 type-I error threshold, the minimum detectable effect size in the county-level all-drug overdose
ED visit specification was just below 3.5 visits per 100,000 caused by a one percentage point increase in the
unemployment rate. The minimum detectable effect size for all power levels and for a variety of type-I error thresholds
(0.1, 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001) is reported in the supplementary appendix. To put this in context, in our preferred model,
a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate predicts a 0.95 per 100,000 (or 7.0%) increase in the mean
opioid overdose ED visit rate, from the baseline average of 13.54. Such an increase in the opioid ED rate, ceteris
paribus, would imply a 0.97% increase in the mean “all drug” overdose ED rate (from 97.52 to 98.47. This expected

17

Substance use disorders are a public health threat and are thought to have an uneven toll
across different segments of the population (Wu et al. 2011). Therefore, we next examine whether
the effects of macroeconomic decline on opioid adverse events differ across race/ethnicity groups.
Table 4 provides results from our preferred specification for each race/ethnic group.25 The first
column repeats the full sample results (from column 3 of Table 3). The remaining columns
separately present the findings for whites, blacks, and Hispanics. As mentioned, we do not present
ED visit results for Hispanics because this category is not classified consistently in the ED data.
The countercyclical variation in opioid-involved deaths is primarily driven by effects on
whites, where a one-point rise in unemployment predicts a highly significant 0.23 per 100,000 (or
3.6 percent) mortality increase. The predicted effects are negative for blacks (-0.14 per 100,000)
and positive but smaller for Hispanics (0.04 per 100,000). This finding is consistent with the
common trends in white and total opioid death rates as depicted in Figure 2.26 It is worth pointing
out that the smaller estimates for nonwhites often represent lower levels for mortality risk, rather
than smaller percentage effects. For instance, the 0.04 unemployment coefficient for Hispanics in
the model corresponds to a 2.5 percent growth from the relatively low average rate of 1.60 per
100,000, which is similar to the corresponding relative change for whites.
The predicted macroeconomic effects on all drug deaths are also dominated by whites with
a 0.48 per 100,000 (4.5 percent) increase anticipated to result from a one-point rise in the
unemployment rate. Corresponding estimates are -0.13 per 100,000 for blacks and 0.11 per
100,000 for Hispanics. For opioid-related ED visits the patterns are somewhat different, with

effect size of 0.95 is well below the minimum detectable effect size of 3.5. (Our power simulations show that for a
minimum detectable effect size of 1 and a type-I error threshold of 0.05, the power is below 6%) Indeed, the point
estimate we recover, 1.19, is quite near the expected effect size, but it is imprecisely estimated due to a lack of power.
25
Tables in the supplementary appendix report results across a variety of specifications by race, mirroring Table 3.
26
There are similar observable common trends between the total and white opioid ED visit rates.

18

strong countercyclical predicted effects for both whites and blacks: a one-point increase in
unemployment is expected to raise white ED visits by 0.91 per 100,000, or 4.8% percent, and black
visits by 1.25 per 100,000, or 17.4% percent. However, the results for nonwhites should be
interpreted with caution as they are often reasonably sensitive to choice of specifications. For
instance, when examining all-drug or opioid-related mortality rates, small and statistically
insignificant unemployment coefficients are obtained for blacks in models that include county and
year fixed effects and county-specific time trends, but not when state-by-year fixed effects replace
the county-specific trends.

VI.

State-Level Results
Table 5 replicates the previous analysis at the state rather than county-level. Aggregated

information on ED visits is used here for 15 states (rather than for the 5 states for which we have
micro-data). Observations are weighted by relevant state (rather than county) population and
standard errors are clustered at the state-level. Our preferred specification includes state and year
fixed-effects, as well as state-specific time trends. See the supplementary appendix for a table
reporting the relevant sample means for the outcomes and explanatory variables.
The first two columns of Table 5 present full-sample estimates. Separate findings for
whites, blacks and Hispanics are shown in columns (3) through (8). The full sample results largely
correspond to those observed using county-level data. Specifically, drug and opioid-related drug
deaths, as well as opioid-related ED visits, are all strongly countercyclical. For example, a onepoint increase in the unemployment rate is predicted to raise the opioid-related mortality rate by
0.33 per 100,000, a growth of 6.2 percent and an elasticity of around 0.39. Similarly, a one-point
increase in the unemployment rate increases the predicted opioid ED visit rate by 3.12 per 100,000

19

(6.2%) and an implied elasticity of 0.22, with small positive (but statistically insignificant)
predicted effects on drug ED visits. Although this pattern of results is similar to our county-level
findings, the magnitude is larger for each coefficient. This is consistent with Lindo’s (2015)
evidence that macroeconomic effects are often understated when using county-level data.27 These
estimates further suggest that almost all of the predicted increase in drug deaths is due to opioidrelated mortality, as evidenced by the similar (0.35 vs. 0.33) unemployment coefficients for the
two dependent variables.
The third through eighth columns of Table 5 again indicate that the mortality effects are
primarily due to changes among whites and, more generally, that the countercyclical variation in
opioid-related deaths and ED visits is very strong for this group. Interestingly, while the
unemployment coefficients on drug and opioid mortality were negative for blacks in some
specifications when using county-level data, they reverse sign (but are often insignificant) with
state-level analysis. This provides further evidence of the sensitivity of the estimates for blacks to
changes in samples or specifications, suggesting that we should be cautious about making
conclusive statements about macroeconomic effects for them. Conversely, evidence of
countercyclical variation in Hispanic drug deaths is obtained using both county and state level
data.28

27

Another important driver of the difference in coefficient size for opioid ED visit rates between our preferred countylevel specification (0.95) and our preferred state-level specification (3.12) is a difference in data. The county-level ED
data count the number of individuals with an opioid overdose diagnosis, whereas the state-level ED data count the
number of opioid overdose ED visits (of which there could be more than one per individual). However, a one
percentage point increase in the unemployment rate has similar percentage effects on county-level opioid ED visits
(7.0%) and state-level ED visits (6.2%).
28
We also estimated models for heroin-related ED visits. These showed no clear pattern, ranging from strongly and
significantly positive to strongly and significantly negative, and were highly sensitive to the choice of specifications.
These results are displayed in the supplementary appendix. The majority of the coefficients were not statistically
different from zero. Thus we cannot make statements about the relationship between heroin abuse and local
macroeconomic conditions.

20

VII.

Robustness Checks

Our results to this point indicate that drug mortality is strongly counter-cyclical, with the most
important role being played by deaths involving opioids in most specifications. Opioid-related ED
visits are also counter-cyclical and both of these effects are strongly driven by changes among
whites. Conversely, the results for Hispanics and, particularly, blacks are more sensitive to model
choices. We conducted a variety of further tests of the robustness of our main results to various
changes in samples or specifications. We summarize these results here, with full discussion and
details of the estimates provided in the supplementary appendix.
All of our county-level specifications include county and year fixed-effects, and most
contain either state-by-year fixed effects (in our preferred specification) or county-specific linear
time trends. Unfortunately, it is not possible to simultaneously control for both together, because
doing so leaves our model with no useful variation.29 As an alternative, we examined the robustness
of our results to incorporating alternative, but more limited, sets of time trends. These included
separate trends for counties by population quintiles (5 trends) or percentiles (100 trends).
Alternatively, we allowed the top 1% of counties (by population size) to have their own individual
trends, with separate trends by percentile for the other 99% of counties. We estimated models with
individual trends for the top 5% of counties, and with separate trends by population vigintile (5%
bins) for the other 95% of counties. Finally, we ran models that incorporated consumer zone rather
than county time trends. Countercyclical variations in opioid death and ED visit rates were
obtained in all of these specifications. The estimates were almost always statistically significant,
although sometimes smaller than in the main specifications. For instance, the unemployment

21

coefficient on opioid death rates was 0.19 in the preferred model and ranged from 0.12 to 0.19 in
the alternative specifications just described.30
We allowed for heterogeneous relationships between the economic climate and adverse
drug outcomes – across factors such as time, county population density, education level, and
industrial structure – by estimating models that excluded categories of counties. The first of these
examined whether the relationship between macroeconomic shocks and opioid abuse differed by
time period. This was done by systematically removing sets of three years at a time from the
analysis sample.31 For drug deaths, the unemployment coefficients and 95% confidence intervals
were always well above zero, although they did fluctuate a bit. Importantly, the estimate that
excluded 2008-2010 was typical of those obtained when removing other periods, indicating that
the results were not driven by unusual effects occurring during the Great Recession. For opioidrelated deaths and ED visits, we obtained a similar story of fairly consistent and strong (although
not always statistically significant) effects when removing sub-periods. We did not find significant
results for any drug ED visit specifications.32
We next investigated sensitivity of the results to the proxy used for macroeconomic
conditions by running a model where the key explanatory variables is employment-to-population
(EP) ratios.33 Since there is no readily available series of county level EP ratios, specifications that

30

Similarly, the ED findings were robust to a majority of alternative time trends, but given the smaller number of
counties in our sample, the results were insignificant when using commuter-zone-specific trends.
31
Three year bins (as opposed to other numbers of years) were chosen to ensure that the full great recession period
was removed in one specification, to insure that our results are not driven by that recession or other short-run
macroeconomic events.
32
It is possible that adverse events may respond asymmetrically to short term increases, rather than decreases, in the
unemployment rate. To test for asymmetry, we perform our analysis on two subsamples of the data, one where the
county-level unemployment rate has decreased relative to the previous year and the other where it has increased. For
the mortality specifications, we find some evidence that economic downturns are driving the magnitude of our
findings, but not the significance. For our ED specifications, we find no statistical difference between the results of
the two sub-samples. The results from this check are reported in the supplementary appendix.
33
Results for EP ratios could differ from those using unemployment rates because, for instance, declines in labor force
participation rates were particularly pronounced during the “Great Recession” that began in 2007, when compared to
other economic downturns (Shierholz, 2012).

22

included them were run at the state level. As expected, they provided coefficient estimates that
were of the opposite sign and slightly smaller in magnitude than those obtained when controlling
for unemployment rates.34 We also decompose our sample into areas differentially impacted by
changes in manufacturing employment and import exposure (Autor et al. 2013), we followed a
strategy analogous to that used for different time periods, by examining how the results changed
when successively omitting sample county quintiles for each variable. We obtained consistent
coefficients across these for both proxies, indicating that our findings were not being driven by
areas with the greatest loss of manufacturing jobs or largest increase in imports.
We explored potential heterogeneity in the effects across urban and rural areas by
successively excluding quintiles of counties based on 2010 population density.35 The mortality
findings were not driven by population density, except that the estimated effects for opioid deaths
were slightly weaker (and statistically significant at the 10% but not the 5% level) when excluding
the densest areas. The results for all-drug ED visits were noisier and centered around zero, while
those for opioid-related ED visits were statistically significant and consistent in magnitude across
all quintiles. Next, we performed the same exercise but systematically dropped counties by
quintile of 2010 high school graduation status and percent nonwhite. Our main results were robust
to these exclusions.
As the reported number of opioid deaths is an undercount of the true number, we use an
imputation procedure to more accurately capture the correct number. In the Appendix we show
that the uncertainty from the imputation process is of minimal concern to the statistical significance

34

Slightly smaller magnitudes were expected since a one-percentage point rise in the unemployment rate usually
translates into a more than one point reduction in EP ratios (since some discouraged jobless individuals drop out of
the labor force in bad times).

of our main findings. As expected, accounting for this additional source of uncertainty increases
our standard errors, but only by a miniscule amount.
We attempted to decompose the effect of the unemployment rate on opioid-related ED
visits by age and payer type group. The opioid ED visits results were consistent across all age
groups and payer types, except for the elderly, for whom both an age group analysis and the
Medicare payer type estimates were positive but not statistically different from zero.36
Finally, we performed a series of placebo tests, examining the unemployment coefficients
on ED visit rates for causes not anticipated to be related to macroeconomic conditions. These
included: vomiting during pregnancy, open head wounds, broken legs or arms and broken noses.
With the exception of broken noses, none of these outcomes were statistically related to
macroeconomic conditions.
VIII.

Discussion
Overall, we obtain strong evidence that opioid-related deaths and ED visits increase during

times of economic weakness, although the results vary somewhat with the unit of observation
(county vs. state) and the exact specifications estimated. In the main county-level models, our
preferred specification indicates that a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate
raises predicted opioid-involved mortality rates by 0.19 per 100,000, corresponding to a 3.6
percent growth and an unemployment elasticity of mortality of around 0.23. These effects are
largely driven by changes in the death rates of whites in most estimates, with much smaller (but
still mostly positive) increases predicted for Hispanics. Opioid-related ED visits are also
anticipated to rise in economic downturns, with strong effects here observed for blacks as well as
whites. There are weaker, and less consistent, results for other mortality and ED outcomes (e.g.

36

This null finding makes sense, since job losses and economic declines during recessions should affect the working
age population and children more than the elderly.

24

heroin-involved or other drug deaths), although often these results are in the same direction as for
opioids.
We find negative economic shocks to have larger adverse effects on drug related mortality
and ED visits when we conduct our analysis at the state (rather than county) level. A one-point
rise in unemployment is predicted to increase overall opioid-related mortality by 0.33 per 100,000,
over one and a half times the size of the county-level estimates, corresponding to growth of 6.2
percent and an unemployment elasticity of around 0.39. These larger estimates could occur
because counties are too narrow a unit of observation to observe the full macroeconomic effects
(Lindo, 2015) or because the county-level models are more fully able to control for potential
confounding factors.
Our results should be interpreted in light of several limitations. First, while we have data
for all deaths to US residents, the information on ED visits is more restricted, especially in our
county level analysis. Second, although we use the two proxies of macroeconomic conditions most
often used in the related literature (unemployment rates and employment to population ratios), and
provide a limited investigation using changes over time in manufacturing employment or import
penetration, a variety of other macroeconomic variables could be considered. These include
measures like home foreclosures at the zip-code level (Currie and Tekin, 2015) and stock market
losses at the national level (Schwartz et al., 2012) that capture different dimensions of economic
decline. Third, there could be errors in the recording of the specific drugs involved in fatal
overdoses and in the reasons for ED visits. We use imputation procedures to minimize effects of
the former, but cannot be sure that our methods are completely successful. Finally, it is unclear
which model specification or unit of analysis is the “best”. We have attempted to address this issue
by providing estimates for a wide variety of models and samples. Most results are robust to these

25

alternatives, but some are not. In particular, unemployment rates are negatively correlated with
black drug mortality rates in the county-level models but not in the state-based specifications and
most, but not all, specifications suggest that the countercyclical variation in drug mortality rates is
predominantly due to changes in opioid-related related deaths, as opposed to other types of drug
fatalities.
There are numerous potential causal pathways linking macroeconomic developments to
health behaviors and their consequences but we know little about the mechanisms for the effects
observed here. For instance, lower incomes might lead to reduced purchases and use of legal or
illicit drugs during periods of economic weakness (Riddell and Riddell, 2006; Dobkin and Puller,
2007) and explanations emphasizing reductions in time costs (e.g. having more time to engage in
time-intensive health-improving behaviors like exercise or recovery treatment programs) would
lead to better outcomes in economic downturns. Neither of these appear to be a dominant factor
for opioids or other drugs that lead to ED visits or deaths, since both are predicted to increase as a
result of negative macroeconomic shocks.37 On the other hand, our results could be consistent with
a role for supply-side factors, such as the loss of health insurance or of public health funding for
treatment or prevention during periods of economic weakness.
Notwithstanding the possible pathways just described, we suspect that the dominant factor
linking macroeconomic conditions to adverse drug outcomes is that fatal and near fatal abuse of
opioids often (and increasingly over time) reflects a physical manifestation of mental health
problems that have long been known to rise during periods of economic decline.38 In this regard,
we note that although opioids are prescribed to treat pain, there are strong linkages between pain,

37

However, worsening economic conditions could lead to reductions in some types of drug use, while increasing
adverse events through changes in composition towards more lethal types of drugs.
38
This dates back to Durkheim’s (1897) work on suicides and includes a great deal of later research including that by
Hamermesh and Soss (1974), and in the more closely related literature, to Ruhm (2000) and others.

26

mental health problems and the use of analgesics.39 With the increased availability of prescription
opioids (and reductions in heroin prices), it seems likely that consumption of these drugs rise when
economic conditions worsen and that some of this increased use leads to adverse outcomes
including emergency department visits or death. Developing a better understanding of the causal
pathways for the results we observe is an important direction for future research.

39

Depression and other forms of mental illnesses increase the experience of pain; pain is associated with more
depressive symptoms and the two share many of the same biological pathways (Bair et al. 2003). Persons with
depression, dysthymia and generalized anxiety or panic disorders use narcotics at relatively high rates (Sullivan et al.,
2006; Braden et al., 2009) and opioids have been shown to have a palliative effect on mental health problems such as
depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (Koran et al. 2005; Bodkin, Zornberg, and Lukas, 1995).

Source: Mortality data are at the county-year and come from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s
Multiple Cause of Death files from 1999-2014 and are adjusted as in text. ED data at the county-year level and
are provided via the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project’s State Emergency Department Databases (SEDD).
SEDD data come from Arizona (2005-2014), Kentucky (2008, 2010-2012), Florida (2005-2014), Maryland
(2002-2012), and New Jersey (2004, 2006-2103). See text for ICD-9 definitions of outcomes. County level unemployment data come from Bureau for Labor Statistics. Unemployment rate, death rates, and ED visit rates are
all weighted by total county population of group. Hispanic ED visits are omitted as the ED data do not contain
a reliable indicator of Hispanic ethnicity.

Supplementary Appendix
Our main analysis results indicate that drug mortality is strongly counter-cyclical, with deaths
involving opioids playing the most important role. Opioid-related ED visits are also countercyclical and both the mortality and ED effects are strongly driven by the changes among whites.
The results for Hispanics and, especially, blacks are more sensitive to the choice of model
specification, suggesting difficulties in making conclusive statements for these demographic
groups. We conducted a variety of tests of the robustness of our results to changes in samples or
specifications.
Given that our main specifications do not simultaneously include both a full set of county
linear time trends and state-by-year fixed effects, we replicated our full sample analysis using
controls for state and year fixed-effects, state-by-year fixed effects and a variety of time trend
specifications. The results from this exercise, presented in Appendix Table A1, show that the
findings are robust. As in Table 3, each specification contains county, year, and state-by-year
fixed-effects, with standard errors clustered at the county level. The number of time trends included
increases as we move down the table and, when doing so, the coefficients of interest gradually
attenuate towards zero. However, our mortality findings are robust to every alternative linear time
trend specification, except in the last row which includes a separate trend for each county. As
discussed, the inclusion of this large number of time trends removes all remaining useful variation.
Similarly, our ED findings are robust to a majority of alternative time trends, but given the smaller
number of counties in our sample, the results are also statistically insignificant when using
commuter zone specific time trends.
We next examined whether the relationship between macroeconomic shocks and opioid
abuse differed by time period. This is investigated in Figure A1 which shows, for our preferred

42

county-level specification, the effect on the coefficients of systematically removing sets of three
years at a time. Three year bins are chosen to ensure that the full great recession period is removed
in one specification, to insure that our results are not driven by the recession or other short run
macroeconomic events. The left side column has all deaths and the right side column shows
corresponding effects for the ED visits.
For drug deaths, the coefficients and 95% confidence intervals are always well above 0,
although they do fluctuate a bit. The estimate that excludes the Great Recession is marked by “0810” is typical of the estimates obtained when removing other sub-periods. For opioid deaths we
obtain a similar story of fairly consistent and strong effects. Opioid-related ED visits show a
similar, consistent and significant estimates when removing sub-periods but we do not find
significant results for any drug ED visit specifications.
Table A2 in the Appendix summarizes the data used in the remaining robustness checks.
County characteristics, including percent of persons aged 25 and over who have graduated high
school and land area (to calculate population density) are extracted from the 2010 U.S. decennial
census. (www.census.gov/2010census/data/). Information on county level median income comes
from the Census’ Small Area Income & Poverty Estimates. County characteristics intending to
capture alternative measures of local economic conditions are obtained from Autor et al. (2013)
and include the percent change in manufacturing and percent change in import exposure (from
1990-2007).
The next robustness check we performed is to include median income as an additional
control variable in our specification of interest. This check is reported in Appendix Table A3 and
follows Table 4 except with the addition of median income. We include this check as median
income represents a potential mechanism for some of the effect of changing macroeconomic

43

conditions. The income coefficient is negative and statistically significant when the dependent
variable is mortality. A comparison of the unemployment coefficients in from Table 4 and Table
A3 indicates that its inclusion generally does not material affect the estimated macroeconomic
effect of unemployment, consistent with the results often obtained in previous related research
(e.g. Ruhm, 2000).
We next tested whether the results were robust to using employment-to-population (EP)
ratios rather than unemployment rates as the proxy for macroeconomics conditions. These results,
summarized in Appendix Table A4, are conducted at the state level since there is no readily
available series of county EP ratios. These results are a virtual mirror (although slightly smaller in
absolute value) of the findings in Table 5, showing that the estimates are not sensitive to this
choice.
We also explored whether the effects differ across urban and rural areas by successively
excluding quintiles of counties based upon 2010 population density. For these results, shown in
Figure A2 the right column again refers to ED visits and the left column to deaths. The mortality
findings are not driven by population density, with the slight exception that the coefficient on
opioid deaths falls slightly (and remains significant at the 10% but not the 5% level) when
excluding the densest areas. The results for ED visits for all drugs are again noisier and centered
around zero, while those for opioid-related ED visits are statistically significant and consistent in
magnitude across all quintiles. Next, we performed the same exercise except systematically
dropping counties by quintile of 2010 high school graduation status (Figure A3) and percent nonwhite (Figure A4). Our main results are robust to these exclusions.
Figures A5 and A6 examine the robustness of our results to dropping counties that
experienced different levels in the percent change in manufacturing employment and the percent

44

change in import exposure, (changes are calculated from 1990 to 2007). These variables, which
were obtained from Autor et. al (2013), were only available as a cross-section and so could not be
used as an independent variable in our main analysis. Instead, we followed the previously
described strategy of examining whether areas most or least impacted by changes in manufacturing
employment or foreign imports were driving our main findings. Once again, we obtained
consistent coefficients across the omitted quintiles for each variable, indicating that those areas
with the greatest loss of manufacturing jobs or the largest increase in imports did not drive our
findings.
Figure A7 performs a series of placebo tests, examining the unemployment coefficients on
ED visit rates for causes not anticipated to be related to macroeconomic conditions. These
included: vomiting during pregnancy, open head wounds, broken legs or arms and broken noses.
With the exception of broken noses, none of these were related to unemployment rates. Finally,
Figure A8 decomposes the effect of the unemployment rate by age and payer type group for ED
opioid overdose admission rates. The results show that opioid-related ED visits are driven by
increases across all age groups and payer types, except for the elderly. While the point estimates
for the elderly (and for Medicare as an expected payer type) are positive, they are not statistically
different from zero. This null finding makes sense, since job losses and economic declines during
recessions should affect the working age population and children more than the elderly.
In addition to the robustness checks just described, we conducted a number of other
descriptive and econometric analyses. Figure A9 shows that all drug deaths follow similar patterns
(although with higher rates) than fatal overdoses involving opioids – with faster growth and higher
rates for whites than for blacks and Hispanics. Figure A10 provides details of our simulated power
analysis, summarized briefly in footnote 25 of the main text.

45

Tables A5 and A6 summarize county-level analyses for other drug outcomes including
mortality or ED visit rates related to heroin, drugs other than opioids and drug other than either
heroin or opioids. These results confirm a countercyclical variation in most types of drug death
rates, although with somewhat less consistent patterns for ED visits.
Tables A7 through A9 provide detailed results for race/ethnicity-specific adverse drug
outcomes. A countercyclical variation is observed for whites for virtually all outcomes and
specification (although it is not always statistically significant for all drug ED visits). For blacks,
the mortality rates are more sensitive to the choice of specifications and, while opioid-related ED
visits are always strongly countercyclical, overall drug death rates or ED visits are generally
statistically insignificant. The point estimates always suggest a countercyclical pattern of Hispanic
drug or opioid mortality but the coefficients are not always statistically significant.
Table A10 provides separate estimates for periods of decreasing versus increasing
unemployment. The general result of a countercyclical variation in adverse drug outcomes holds
across both periods, with no clear pattern of differences.
As mentioned in the paper, data using death certificates will understate the involvement of
opioids (or any other drug category) because in 20%-25% of fatal overdoses the type(s) of drug(s)
responsible for the overdose is(are) left unspecified (Ruhm, 2017). As previously outlined, to
correct for the undercount in opioid deaths, we use an imputation procedure. Table A11 examines
the sensitivity of our findings to accounting for the uncertainty introduced in the imputation stage.
The first panel in Table A11 reports our estimates from Table 4. The second panel displays the
results from a multiple imputation analysis with standard errors that account for fact that some of
the opioid deaths are estimated. This process follows a standard multiple imputation framework
(Rubin, 1987). Following White et al. (2011), we first generate 100 different datasets each of which

46

is imputed (only for those individuals who died of a drug overdose and whose death certificate is
missing information on the specific drug(s) responsible) via a draw from a probit model estimated
conditional on the observed data. We then re-estimate our specification of interest using each of
these 100 simulated datasets, storing the coefficient and standard error from each iteration. Each
final coefficient and standard error is calculated by combining the vector of results using Rubin’s
(1987) rules. The final, corrected standard error accounts for both within specification variation
and between specification variation. The between specification variation is driven by the difference
in estimated coefficients across the 100 datasets and is identical to the square of the bootstrapped
standard error (the standard deviation of the coefficient). The results presented in A11 demonstrate
that the uncertainty from the imputation process is of minimal concern to the statistical significance
of our main findings. As expected, accounting for this additional source of uncertainty increases
the standard errors, but only minimally. Most differences are only salient once the number decimal
places reported is extended to four.
Finally, Table A12 shows county-level estimates for ED visits due to drugs other than
opioids or heroin. The unemployment coefficients vary in sign and are usually statistically
insignificant, except for benzodiazepine-related visits, which vary countercyclically. This finding
is unsurprising as benzodiazepines are often taken with opioids. A CDC report found that in 2011,
benzodiazepines were present in 31% of the opioid deaths (Chen et al. 2014).

Note: * p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01. Robust standard errors clustered at the county level in
parentheses. Each regression is weighted by county population of group. The specification that accounts for imputation uncertainty is an average of 100 different specifications, each identical except
using a different dataset. Each datasets is drawn from the imputed variables to capture the uncertainty
in the measurement. Coefficients and standards errors are calculated using Rubin’s (1987) rules as outlined in White et al. (2011). Coefficients and standard errors are reported to four decimal points so
differences are salient.
