Aging, Moving, and Housing Wealth

ABSTRACT

We have described the relationship between family attributes
and moving, and between moving and change in housing wealth.

Moving is often associated with retirement and with precipitating
shocks like the death of a spouse or by other changes in marital

status. Median housing wealth increases as the elderly age. Even
when the elderly move, housing equity is as likely to increase as

to decrease. Thus the typical mover is not liquidity constrained,
although some are. High transaction cost associated with moving
is apparently not the cause for the lack of the reduction in

housing wealth as the elderly age. The absence of a well
developed market for reverse mortgages may be explained by a lack

of demand for these financial instruments. The evidence suggests
that the typical elderly family does not wish to reduce housing

wealth to increase current consumption. For whatever reason,
there is apparently a considerable attachment among homeowners to
past housing.

AGING, MOVING, AND HOUSING WEALTH

by
Steven F. Vent! and David A. Wise

It is often claimed that the elderly live in inappropriate

housing. Indeed the claim is that many would like to live
elsewhere and would, were it not for the large transactions cost

associated with moving. These costs are understood to include not
only direct monetary costs, but also the psychic costs inherent in
changing neighborhoods, losing contact with longtime friends, and

the like. This reasoning has been the rationale for the belief
that reverse mortgage schemes would be of benefit to the elderly,

were the market for them easily accessible. This paper is the
first stage of research directed ultimately to analysis of the

transaction costs associated with elderly moving. It concentrates
on the empirical description of the relationship between moving
and housing expenditure of the elderly.

There are three themes in the paper: The first is directly
motivated by the hypothesis that a significant number of elderly
would like to use housing equity to finance current consumption,
were that possible without having to incur the large transaction

costs of moving. The proposition is not that the elderly live in
housing that is inappropriate for them and that they ought to

move. It is not, for example, that an elderly couple living in a
large house that it wants to leave to its children has made an

inappropriate housing choice. Rather the question is whether the
couple would like to use the housing resources for other purposes.

If this were the case, one might expect that when moves occur

Page 2

wealth would be taken out of housing and used to finance current
consumption.

A second theme is the extent to which the elderly more

generally draw down housing equity as they age. It is well known
that a very large proportion of saving is in the form of housing
and that many of the elderly have essentially no other assets.
Venti and Wise [1986] report that the median level of financial

assets among respondents to the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances

was about $1,300. The median level of all assets (excluding
Social Security and firm pension plans) was $22,900, the vast

majority of which was in housing. Evidence on the assets of the
elderly is reported in Hurd and shoven [1983], Diamond and Hausman

[1984], and in Hurd and Wise [1987]. Diamond and Hausman, for
example, report that 20 percent of those aged 45 to 59 had

essentially no non-pension personal wealth in 1966. Nearly 50
percent had non—housing assets less than $1,000. Given that such
a large proportion of personal saving is in the form of housing,
one is led to ask whether it is used, as the life cycle theory

would predict, to finance consumption in old age. Third, the
descriptive analysis here is to serve as the first stage of

analysis of moving transaction costs among the elderly. It sets
forth the empirical regularities with which more formal modeling
and analysis must be consistent.

The analysis is based on the Retirement History Survey (BBS).

This survey follows for ten years families headed by persons who

were between 58 and 63 years old in 1969. They were reinterviewed

Page 3

every two years until 1979. Data were collected on a wide variety
of socioeconomic measures, including income, wealth by detailed
asset category, retirement, health status, and many others.
Merrill [1984] used data from the 1969 and 1977 RIIS interviews to

study the home equity of the elderly. The focus of her work is
similar to ours, although the details of the two analyses are

quite different. In particular, we use each of the six RHS
interviews to analyze the moving and housing choices of the

elderly. By considering changes in each two—year interval, we are
able for the most part to associate changes in housing equity with

individual moves. By considering changes over short time
intervals, we also minimize the potential effects on the

conclusions of attrition from the sample. While our methods
differ from hers, her basic conclusions are supported by- our
findings.

The first section of the paper describes the frequency of

moving by type of housing and by the wealth and income of

respondents. Section two considers the correlates of moving. Who
moves? In particular, retirement and death of a spouse are
emphasized. In addition, we consider the relationship between
income and housing equity on the one hand, and moving on the

other. The desire to sell a house to finance current consumption
might be expected to be concentrated among persons with low

current income and relatively higher housing equity. We consider
whether there is in fact a concentration of moving among persons

in this income—housing—wealth group. The third section compares

Page 4

changes in housing value, housing equity, and user cost over time

for movers compared to non—movers (stayers). Non—housing

bequeathable wealth is also traced. If wealth is withdrawn from
housing at the time of a move, it should show up as an increase in
non—housing bequeathable wealth after the move.
The conclusions of the paper may be summarized briefly:
• The elderly typically do not use saving in the form of
housing equity to finance current consumption as they age,
contrary to the usual life cycle theory. Indeed, as
Bernheim (1984) and Merrill [1984) have reported, housing
equity increased with age over the period of the RHS.
•

When the elderly move, they are as likely to increase as to
decrease housing equity. This suggests that the reason for
the virtual absence of a reverse mortgage market may be the
lack of demand for such financial arrangements. Even if
the transaction costs associated with moving deter many
elderly from changing housing, these costs are apparently
not what is causing the absence of consumption of housing
equity by the elderly. Those who do move don't, on
average, withdraw wealth from housing. Thus the typical
mover is apparently not liquidity constrained.
Many of the elderly with little current income also have
little housing equity, so that little could be gained by
converting it to an annuity, even at an actuarially fair
rate. This is consistent with the findings of Manchester
[1987], based on data from the Panel Survey of Income
Dynamics. That annuity rates are much less than
actuarially fair, as shown by Friedman and Warshawsky
(1985), may be a further deterrent.
The attachment to past living arrangements and the
maintenance of housing equity may be motivated by a bequest
motive, although this explanation is brought into question
by the absence of a significant relationship between change
in housing equity and whether the family has children,
consistent with the findings of Hurd [1986) for non—housing
bequeathable wealth.

The elderly with high income and low housing equity are the
most likely to move; those with low income and high housing
equity are less likely than the former group but more
likely than other elderly families to move. One may

Page 5

conclude that moving by the elderly is just as likely to be
motivated by the desire to reallocate more income to
housing as to use housing wealth to finance current
consumption. However, among homeowners who move, those
with low income and high housing equity reduce housing
equity the most; those with high income and low housing
equity increase housing wealth the most.
Moving is strongly related to retirement and to
precipitating shocks like change in marital status, in
particular the death of a spouse.

The Frequency and Nature of Moves

Much of the data that will be presented pertains to changes

in housing between two survey periods. Where the changes do not
vary greatly over the five possible conlparisons-—1969 to 1971,

1971 to 1973, etc... —— we typically present data for the 1973 to
1975 interval.

The likelihood that a family moves during a two-year interval
depends on housing type, as shown in the tabulation below.

Those who rent are almost three times as likely to move as those

who own. The "other" category includes persons living with
relatives, living in homes owned by others, or paying no cash

rent. Most moves are between the same housing tenure. This is

Page 6

shown by a transition matrix for those who moved between 1973 and
1975.

Almost 80 percent of homeowners who move move to another house.
change in housing tenure occurs mostly among the elderly who live

in other situations. Thus when we consider changes in housing
type from one period to the next, we find that the vast majority
of people are in the same type of housing, except the small
prthportion of the elderly who are in the other housing category at

the beginning of the period, as shown below.

Finally, some people who don't move do in fact change housing

tenure. Some rent the housing they used to own, and vice—versa.
Ownership of others may be transferred to children or to other

Page 7

relatives. In still other cases someone else may assume the rent
obligation. Change in tenure without moving is especially common

among those in the other category.1 This can be seen in a
transition matrix for stayers (non—movers).

The transition matrices for the other years look similar to

those for the 1973—1975 period. The transition probabilities for
movers vary with age, however. The RHS respondents were 62 to 67

years old in 1973. In the 1973—1975 interval, renters were more
likely to change to owning than owners were to change to renting.

Transition probabilities for movers by age can be calculated from

the RHS by combining data from all of the survey years. Only for
the ages 60 through 65 (but not 63) is the transition probability
from renting to owning greater than the probability from owning to

renting; for all other ages from 58 to 71 the reverse is true. In

1There may of course be response and coding errors in the
data. And they may be concentrated among respondents reported to
be in the other category.

Page 8

this respect the RHS data appear to be consistent with evidence
from the Annual Housing Survey (AilS).2

An indication of the cumulative effect of these transition
probabilities over the ten year period of the RHS is provided by
the likelihood of moving between 1969 and 1979 for those who

responded in both years. The percent of respondents who moved at
least once during this period is:

2According to the 1973 MIS, 23 percent of owners with heads
aged 62 to 64 who moved changed to renting; 32 percent of renters
who moved changed to owning. Of those aged 65 and older, the
percents were 39 and 15 respectively. (See U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development (1979], Table a—7.) Excluding the
other category, apparently making the data more comparable with
the MIS, the percents by age based on the mis are as follows:

Although the RHS samples families and the MIS structures, the
data from the two surveys do not appear to be inconsistent. We do
not know whether other differences between the surveys should be
expected to yield differences in the results from the two surveys.

Many movers, especially renters, moved more than once. Of the
original owners who moved and were in the sample in 1979, 73
percent moved once, 18 percent twice, and 9 percent more than

twice. Of the original renters who moved, 50 percent moved once,
24 percent twice, and 26 percent more than twice. The transition
matrix for all respondents describes the net result of these moves
over the ten—year period.

There is considerably more movement from renting to owning than

from owning to renting. Most of the original owners still own; 7
percent rent. But 23 percent of original renters own at the end
of the period. The reason is that renters are much more likely
than owners to move, not that when renters move they are more

likely than owners to switch tenures, as explained above. Some of
the initial respondents died and others dropped out of the sample

for other reasons. This attrition may have some effect on the

recorded transition probabilities. Renters, for example, are more
likely than owners to drop out of the sample. We do not believe,

Page 10

however, that attrition seriously confo;nds the interpretation of
the data.

Persons who buy often move out of state; renters are much

less likely to leave the state. The RHS provides limited
information on the distance of moves in the 1973-1975 period. For
initial owners and renters, distance is indicated in the
tabulation below, where the entries are percents.

Wealth and Income

Page 11

housing, it is not surprising that homeowners have much more

wealth than renters. Owners also have much higher incomes. And
they have much more non—housing bequeathable wealth and more

Social Security wealth, the latter reflecting higher lifetime
earnings.

The extent to which housing equity could be used to increase

current consumption depends of course on how much housing equity

there is. The extent to which individuals might wish to do that
may depend on housing equity compared to current income. For
example, persons with low income but large housing equity stand to

gain the most by converting housing equity into current

consumption. An indication of the potential for such transfers is
provided by the distribution of housing equity by income.4 It is
shown below by the income and housing equity quartiles of home
owners •

Social Security income.
5The income quartiles are: <$5,400, $5,400—$10,65l, $10,651—
$17,902, and $17,902+. The housing equity quartiles are:
<$16,334; $l6334—$27,767; $27,767—$45,407; and $45,407+. The non—
housing wealth quartiles are: <$64,254; $64,254—$101,599;
$lOl,599—$152,73l; and $152,731+.

Over 40 percent of those in the lowest income quartile also are in
the lowest housing equity quartile.

Thus a reverse mortgage may not expand much the opportunity

for this group to increase current consumption. For example,
consider a family with housing wealth of $16,334, the maximum in

the lowest housing equity quartile (1979 dollars). Assume
approximate average male life expectancy at 65 of 15 years.
Suppose that the household obtains a loan for the value of the

house and uses the proceeds from the loan to buy an annuity. If
both the mortgage rate and the annuity "yiel& are 10 percent, the
annual income from the reverse annuity mortgage would be only

$548. In fact, this is an overestimate. The annuity yield is
typically much lower than the mortgage rate. In 1979, the average
mortgage rate was 10.8 percent and the average annuity yield 4.8

percent.6 With these rates, the income from the reverse annuity

6See Friedman and Warshawsky [1985].

Page 13

mortgage would be negative, —$212 per annum.

Housing equity together with other wealth is possibly a

better measure of consumption possibilities. Their joint
distribution is shown below.

Again, those with little non-housing wealth tend to have little

housing equity as well. Close to half of those in the lowest non—
housing wealth quartile are also in the lowest housing equity

quartile and almost three quarters are in the lowest half. Data
for other years look very similar to those for 1973.

II. Who Moves?
A.

Descrintive Data

The likelihood of moving is highest for those with an

apparent imbalance in income versus housing equity. The percent
that moved during the 1973-1975 period by income and housing
equity quartiles is shown for homeowners in the matrices below;

The most striking feature of these data is that persons who have
relatively high non—housing wealth, but low housing equity are the

most likely to move. Persons in the highest non-housing wealth
quartile are more than twice as likely to move if they have low

rather than high housing equity. Families with low non-housing

Page 15

wealth but high housing equity are not unusually likely to move,

contrary to what would be expected if moving typically were used
to withdraw wealth from housing and reallocate it to current
consumption.

According to the first matrix, however, families with high
housing equity but low income are about as likely to move as

families with high income but low housing equity. Persons with
high incomes but devoting relatively little of it to housing may

move to reallocate more of their income to housing. This may
simply reflect optimal adjustment to desired housing expenditure,

given current circumstances. But it may also be a response in

part to government policies. Medicaid rules, for example, often
require virtual exhaustion of non—housing wealth, but not housing

equity, before nursing home expenses are paid. Families with low
income but high housing equity, may move to withdraw wealth from

housing; they may be liquidity constrained. The evidence in the
next section supports these presumptions.

In principle, homeowners could withdraw wealth from housing

by increasing the mortgage on the house. Presumably those with
the most housing wealth would be in the best position to do this.

And indeed housing equity could be increased by paying off a

mortgage. But change in the amount of home mortgages has been
rare in the absence of a move. Thus in practice it would appear
that moving is typically the mechanism by which housing wealth has

been increased or decreased. Recent tax legislation that
eliminates the tax deductibility of interest on consumer

Page 16

borrowing, other than mortgages, may change the frequency of home
equity loans, however.

The probability that a renter moves shows little relationship

to income, to wealth, or to rent. In particular, it does not
appear that families with high rent and low income, or with low

income and high rent, are more likely than others to move. The
percent of renters who move is shown by income and total wealth
quartile and by income and rent quartile below.

Moving is often associated with job change. Among the
elderly, it is more likely to be associated with retirement. it
is also strongly associated with precipitating shocks, the death

of a spouse in particular. The relationship of moving to
retirement is shown in table 2 and to death of a spouse in table
Homeowners are about twice as likely to move if the
respondent retires during the two—year interval than if retirement

does not occur.8 The difference is also substantial, although
somewhat less, for renters. The death of the respondent almost
doubles the likelihood that homeowners and renters move during

many of the two year intervals. (The effect of change in family
size is shown in appendix table 1. The numbers are close to those
pertaining to death of a spouse in table 3, although change in
family size could occur for many other reasons, as well as death
of the respondent.)

Possibly the most informative description of the relationship
between age and moving is the empirical hazard rate, the percent

7Respondents are defined to be retired if they report that
they are retired or that they are partially retired but are
neither working nor looking for work.
81n the beginning of the ten-year RI-IS period, most of those
who don't retire during a two—year interval are still working,
while by the end of the period most who don't retire are already
retired. The data in table 2 show that the probability of moving
is about the same for both groups, judging from the percents in
the 1969—1971 and 1977—1979 intervals for example——6.7 and 7.2
respectively.

For example, 7.2 percent of the homeowners who were 58 in 1969

moved in the next two years, by 1971. Looking down the last
column, there appears to be a slight increase in the probability
of moving at the peak retirement years, 60 to 65, and possibly

some decline with age, although both effects are slight. There
appear to be no important cohort effects, judging by the
similarity of the percents for people of the same age in different

years. One might expect that not moving for several years would
tend to identify stayers versus movers. If this selection effect

Those who enter each successive calculation have not moved for

longer and longer periods of time. For all cohorts this effect is
summarized in the bottom row. Any such effect does not show up
strongly in this tabulation, although possibly indicated by the
decline from around 8 percent in 1971 to about 6 percent in 1979.

Whatever this effect is, it may be indistinguishable from the

effect of age. Calculations below will help to make the
distinction clearer, however.

The data for renters suggest a rather strong selection of stayers

in the sample, after successive periods without moving. There is
on average a substantial decline in the probability of moving as
the number of years without moving increases, summarized in the

bottom row.9 On the other hand, there seems to be little effect
of age, judged by looking down the columns.
B.

Paraineterizatjon of Hazard Rates

Finally, these hazard rates are parameterized as simple
functions of age, retirement, marital status, health status, and

income-housing equity quartiles. Given that a person has not yet
moved at the time of a survey, the probability of moving by the
next survey is estimated as a function of these variables, using a

probit functional font. Those who move in a given interval are
deleted from the calculations for subsequent intervals. The use
of the probit font for the interval probability of moving is
consistent with a Brownian motion formulation of a continuous time

hazard model.1°
The Brownian motion version of a hazard model may be

described briefly. Suppose that at age t there is a gain G(t)

that could be obtained by moving. It may be thought of as

9To the extent that this progressive selection of stayers
versus movers is important, more formal analysis should account
for it.
It must also recognize that persons are observed in mid
tenure at the beginning of the survey, some have moved recently
while others have been in the same dwelling for many years,
sometimes referred to as left censoring. From these data,
however, we know how long homeowners have been living in the
current residence and that will be accounted of in subsequent
analysis.

-0Strictly speaking, this is only true if a move is "non—
absorbing". In our case it is absorbing. The probit estimates,
however, provide accurate descriptions of the hazard rates over
the two—year intervals. See for example Hausinan and Wise (1985].

Page 21

G(t) =

M(t)

-

S(t),

where M(t) is the utility associated with

moving to the best available alternative housing and S(t) is the

utility associated with staying in the present location. The
probability of moving is given by Pr[G(t) =

M(t)

—

S(t)

>

oj.

That G(t) follows a Brownian motion (Weiner) process with
drift u means that:
• Every increment G(t+d) - G(t) is normally distributed with
mean ud and variance c2d; and
-

The increments for every pair of disjoint time intervals
are independent.

Because the increments are assumed to be independent, given G(t),
G(t+d) is a function only of G(t) and the drift u.

If moving is not an absorbing state, meaning that a person
could move and then move back again ——
in our case ——

not a realistic possibility

the probability that a person who has not moved by

age t will move by age t + d is given by
(1)

Pr[G(t+d) > 0

G(t) =

g(t)]

=

F[{g(t)+ud}/cdV2],

where F is a cumulative normal distribution function. This is an
interval hazard rate with a simple probit functional form.

If moving is an absorbing state, a family could not be in the
same house at the beginning and at the end of the period but have

moved during the interval. In this case, the interval hazard

becoines

Pr[G(t+d) > 0

G(t) =

In our case, d is two years and the starting point g(t) must

be estimated. We parameterize u as a function of age; housing
equity and current income; and changes in retirement, marital, and

health status. If the interval d is defined to be 1 and c is set
to 1, equation (1) is in the form of a standard probit

specification. (The variance c is not identified if there is no

variation in d.) The results for the absorbing state version of
the hazard tell the same story as those using the simple model and
are not presented.

An advantage of estimating the interval hazards period by
period is that the effect of each variable is allowed to vary

freely as persons age. The results for the simple probit are
reported in tables 4a and 4b. Table 4a is based on all intervals
combined, while table 4b presents estimates for selected intervals

separately. The last column of the tables shows the change in the

probability of moving due to each of the attributes. The change
is evaluated at the mean of all of the other attributes. For
example, if the sixteen variables describing home equity and
income in table 4a are set to zero -—

identifying

a family with

high income and high housing equity -— and all of the others are

set at their means, the probability of moving is .084. If instead
of high housing and high income, the family had low housing equity

Page 23

and high income, the probability of moving would be .084 + .047 =

.131, or .047 higher.
The estimates support several conclusions. First, as
indicated in the summary tables above, moving is often related to
retirement and is often precipitated by the death of a spouse or

by other changes in marital status. For example, based on the
estimates for all intervals combined, in table 4a, the probability
that a homeowner moves increases from .046 to .101 (.046 + .055)

if the head retires. The probability that the typical married
couple moves is .066. If the husband dies during the interval,
the probability is .118. other changes in marital status, like
divorce or marriage, are much more likely to be associated with a

move. In these cases, the probability of a move is .426 (.066 +

.360)

12

The estimated coefficients on the income-housing equity
indicators in table 4a show that the probability of moving is
greatest for families with the greatest apparent imbalance in

income versus housing equity. The estimated hazard rates for the
three home equity and income levels distinguished in the probit
specification, assuming other attributes at their sample means
are:

12other studies also report substantial increases in mobility
associated with these demographic shocks. See Feinstein and
McFadden [1987] in this volume, who report the effects of both
retirement and changes in family composition; and Merrill (1984],
who reports the effects of retirement, also based on the RI-IS.

hazard rate is 7.6 percent. Holding other attributes

constant, the hazard rate for families with high income and low

housing equity is 13.1 percent. Those with low income and high
housing equity are somewhat less likely to move, although they are

more likely than the average. These estimates provide no evidence
that homeowners typically use housing wealth to increase current

consumption. The results in this section together with those
below suggest that persons with high incomes and low housing
equity are likely to move to increase housing expenditure1 while
those with low income and high housing equity tend to reduce

housing equity when they move. Data in the next section show that
movers in general do not reduce housing equity.

Change in health status has little effect on the probability

of moving, according to our measures. An improvement in health is
associated with a .019 increase in the probability of moving, from

.067 to .086. A worsening of health status is associated with a
.001 decline in the probability of moving.

Page 25

The parameter estimates show no effect of age on moving.
That is, age at the beginning of a two year period is unrelated to

the probability of moving. Note that these variables indicate
ages that are two years greater with each successive interval,

beginning with 58 at the beginning of the 1969-1971 interval. The
year effects, indicated by the first year of each of the two year

intervals, are small but declining consistently. They reflect the
increasing selection of stayers as the number of years without a

move increases. The estimates indicate that those who have not
moved before 1977, are .024 less likely to move in the subsequent
two-year interval than the typical person in the sample in 1969 is
to move by 1971, .078.

Estimates of the effect of individual attributes on the
hazard rates of renters are shown in table 5 for all survey

intervals combined. As with homeowners, retirement and changes in
marital status have substantial effects on probability of moving.

There is no age effect. Unlike homeowners, however, there are
substantial year effects on the probability that renters move,
indicating substantial and increasing selection of stayers as the

number of years without a move increases. The hazard rate
declines from .294 in the 196g—l97l interval to .151 in the 1977—

1979 interval. As shown in the tabulation below, low income
families are somewhat more likely to move, but there is no
relationship between rent and the likelihood of moving.

III. Moving. Housing Value, and User Cost
It has been shown that only about 8 or 9 percent of

homeowners move in any two-year period and that only about 25

percent moved over the entire ten—year period. Renters are much
more likely to move; about a quarter move in any two—year period
and almost 65 percent of initial renters had moved at least once

by 1979. Retirement and death of a spouse are strong
precipitating factors associated with moving.

In this section we consider how housing equity and user cost

change with moving. In particular, we analyze the extent to which

wealth is withdrawn from housing at the time of moving. The
market value of housing and housing equity are the principle
measures that are analyzed for homeowners.
In addition, we consider the change in non—housing

bequeathable wealth. If wealth is withdrawn from housing at the
time of a move, it should show up as an increase in non—housing

bequeathable wealth. This provides a check on the housing equity

Page 27

data. For example, persons may undervalue their houses,

especially during a period of increasing housing prices. When the
person moves and a new house is bought, its actual market value is

revealed. The difference between this value and the estimated
value of the previous house could exaggerate the increase in

housing value when at the time of a move. The change in non—
housing bequeathable wealth would not be subject to this potential

bias, however)-3 If the elderly typically have more wealth in
housing than they would like, we would expect to see a fall in
housing

equity, and an increase in non—housing bequeathable

wealth, among those who move.

Change in rent is determined for renters. In addition, we
follow

the change in the user cost of housing for both homeowners

and renters. This provides a measure that is comparable for both

groups. It also is a direct indicator of the extent to which the
elderly move to reduce such expenditure. We find that the typical
move is just as likely to be associated with an increase as a
decrease in housing equity and that user cost is also just as
likely to increase as to decrease.

-3In addition, housing value and other wealth measures have
been imputed when they are missing. To the extent that this
introduces error in the measurements used here, the error should
be less for bequeathable wealth, which is composed of several
individually reported categories. We also calculated the change
in the housing equity and housing value of movers based only on
the reported values of those who responded to the relevant
questions. The results were virtually the same as those obtained
using imputations for the missing values. We are indebted to
Michael Hurd for putting together a very complete and detailed
asset tape from the RHS original data.

of analysis are discussed. The first is based on

changes between adjacent survey years. In this case, the sample
includes all homeowners in the sample in each of the two survey

periods. The second is based only on respondents who remained in
the sample over the entire period of the RHS. This has the
advantage of providing data on families both before and after a

move. On the other hand, effects of attrition may have a more
substantial effect on the calculations when only those who remain
in the survey for ten years are included in the analysis.

Attrition is unlikely to have an important effect on the
calculations based on two—year intervals.14
Table 6 shows the change in the market value of housing,

housing equity, and non—housing bequeathable wealth for movers and

stayers over each two—year interval of the RHS. The comparison
with stayers provides a control for economy wide changes during

each interval. In two of the six intervals, the change in housing
value for movers is greater than for stayers. In four of the five
intervals more than half of the changes for movers were positive.

The equity value of housing was also as likely to increase as to

decrease when a move occurred. The median change in equity value
was usually somewhat less for movers than for stayers, however, on

14Merrill [1984] used only families in the sample in both
1969 and 1977.

Page 29

the order of $1,500 or $2,000. In four of the five periods, the
fall in non—housing bequeathable wealth was greater for movers

than for stayers. This may be the clearest evidence that wealth
is not typically withdrawn from housing at the time of a move.
The percent with a fall in non-housing bequeathable wealth was
typically almost the same for movers as for stayers.
An alternative description of these measures is presented in
appendix table 2.

It shows housing value, housing equity, and

non-housing bequeathable wealth for those who were homeowners

during the entire period of the RHS. The data distinguish
families by whether they moved or stayed during a particular twoyear interval, and show the values in each of the other years of

the survey as well. Illustrative findings are graphed in figures
la, lb, and lc. The first of each pair of graphs distinguishes
those who moved between 1969 and 1971 from those who didn't.

Persons in either of these move or stay groups may have moved g
stayed in subsequent years. The second of each pair distinguishes

movers and stayers in the 1975-1977 interval. Median home value
increased over the RHS period for both movers and stayers. Movers

typically had greater housing value than stayers. The median home
value of movers always increased at the time of the move. The
median equity value of housing always declines somewhat at the

time of the move, but increases thereafter. Movers have more
housing equity than stayers, based on these data for those who

Page 30

remained in the survey for its duration.15 And the difference is
typically about as large at the end of the RHS period as at the
beginning.

Median non—housing bequeathable wealth declines continuously
for both movers and stayers, and at approximately the same rate.

At the time of the mOve it is as likely to decrease as to

increase. (It decreases in both of the graphs that are shown.)
Again, the typical elderly mover appears to withdraw little if any
housing equity at the time of the move.'6
Finally, we have estimated by linear regression the
relationship between family attributes and the change in hone
equity when the family moves (to another owner—occupied dwelling).

(See table 7.) The variables are the same as those used to
estimate the interval hazard rates above. We emphasize the
relationship between the change in housing equity on the one hand
and initial income versus housing equity on the other.

3-5The analysis based on adjacent survey years indicates the
opposite.

16An apparent anomoly in the data is that among the few
homeowners who are reported to move to rental housing, there is no
appreciable increase in non—housing bequeathable wealth, although
the medians are positive. Indeed, the sum of the change in
housing wealth and the change in non-housing bequeathable wealth
is negative, at the median, for this group. In part, the moves
are associated with the death of the husband and we know from Hurd
and Wise (1987] in this volume that substantial wealth is lost at
the death of the husband. In addition, some wealth may be
transfered to children. Symmetrically, there is an increase in
the reported sum of the changes in these two categories among
families who move from renting to owning. We have been unable to
find a complete explanation.

Page 31

Because of reporting errors, there is a tendency for those

who report an unusually high level of income or home equity in one

survey year to report a lower level in the next. In other words,

errors in variables create a regression toward the mean. To
correct for this, we estimate the change in housing equity for all

homeowners, identifying separately those who move. Thus, for
example, the estimated reduction in home equity for families who
move and who report low income and high home equity in the first
year of a two—year interval is the difference between the
reduction for movers and the reduction for stayers; the regression

toward the mean is netted out. The mean change in home equity for
movers is shown below:

Families with low income and high housing wealth reduce

housing equity when they move. On the other hand, families with
high income and low housing wealth, increase equity substantially

at the time of the move. Overall, movers are as likely to
increase as to decrease housing equity.

Page 32

Homeowners apparently do not typically move to withdraw

wealth from housing. They do not, in general, move to relieve a
liquidity constraint, although some apparently do. Indeed, there
is a somewhat greater tendency for moves to be associated with

high income elderly who want to spend more on housing than with
low income families with high housing wealth who want to withdraw
wealth from housing.

Like the housing equity of stayers, the equity of movers

tends to increase from year to year before and after the move. Of
course, the increase in home value in the absence of a move

reflects the economy—wide trend in housing prices over the period
of the R}IS, not necessarily a conscious decision to increase

saving through housing equity. The change at the time of a move
presumably does reflect conscious intention. Non—housing
bequeathable wealth fell over time and usually more for movers

than for stayers. In considering lifecycle theories of saving,
housing equity is usually thought of jointly with, and like, other

forms of saving, presumably to be consumed in old age. These data

suggest that this view is not correct for housing. Non—housing
bequeathable wealth is observed to fall with age. Most housing
will apparently be left as a bequest, judging by the behavior of
the R11S respondents through age 73.

This does not necessarily suggest that to leave a bequest is

the reason that housing equity is not consumed. Indeed the change
in housing equity at the time of a sale by elderly persons without
children is about the same as the change for those with children.

Page 33

Housing equity increases for about half of movers in each group.
The same is true for the market value of housing. There is some
evidence that non—housing bequeathable wealth falls less for

movers with than without children. The differences are not
substantial, however. This suggests that the elderly may well be
attached to their homes for reasons other than or in addition to
the bequest motive. 17
B.

Moving and Rent

The rent of stayers typically declines over time, as shown in

table 8. On the other hand, the median rent of movers usually
increases. The initial rent of movers and stayers is about the
same. An alternative description of the data is presented in
appendix table 3. Like comparable tables for owners, it
distinguishes movers and stayers in each two year interval, but
also shows rents in each of the other years of the RHS as well.
The respondents used in this table rented in each of the years.

Typical rents are graphed in figure 2. Those who don't move have

declining rents. Thus there appears to be a substantial benefit
to remaining in the same rental unit. Rent increases of stayers
do not keep up with the rate of inflation. Indeed this apparent
rent advantage to continuing renters may provide an incentive not
to move.

17 See similar evidence in Hurd [l986J, that pertains to nonhousing bequeathable wealth.

Page 34

The rent of movers increases at the time of the move, but
typically declines in other years, reflecting the lower price

faced by sitting tenants. For example, the rents of those who
moved between 1971 and 1973 declined somewhat between 1969 and
1971, then increased sharply at the time of the move, and declined

thereafter. Of course, both the movers and stayers in the 19 69—
1971 period could have roved in subsequent or in earlier years.
C.

User Cost

User cost provides a measure that is comparable for both

owners and renters. It includes rent, mortgage payments, heat,

electricity, gas, water, and trash removal. The change in user
cost by tenure and move type is shown in table 9•18 The median
change in the user cost of movers who own in both years is
typically small and close to the change for non—movers.

Consistent with the rent data in the previous section, the change
in user cost for renters who move is usually positive and is

always greater than the change for stayers. The median increase
in user cost for those who move from owner—occupied to rental

housing is in the neighborhood of $800 per year. Between 60 and
70 percent of the increases are positive for this group. The
median change for those who move from rental to owner—occupied

t8secause of a change in the wording of some of the survey
questions used to calculate user cost, the 1969 data are
inconsistent with data for subsequent years. For this reason 1969
figures are deleted from the graphs.

Page 35

housing is negative in each interval, but much smaller than the
increase for those who make the reverse move. Positive changes
are almost as likely as negative ones.

User cost in each year of the survey is shown in figure 3, by

move status in selected two-year intervals. It is easy to see
that median user cost increases at the time of the move. In most
other years user cost declined for both movers and stayers.

Again, it is important to keep in mind that members of either
group could have moved or stayed in intervals other than the one
used for classification.

IV. Summary and Conclusions
We have described the relationship between family attributes
and moving, and between moving and change in housing wealth.

Moving is often associated with retirement and with precipitating
shocks like the death of a spouse or by other changes in marital

status. Median housing wealth increases as the elderly age. Even
when the elderly move, housing equity is as likely to increase as

to decrease. (Although the RHS only follows persons through age
73, Garber [1987] in this volume reports no decline (in fact an
increase) from age 70 through age 95 for non—institutionalized

households, based on the National Long—Ten Care Survey.) The
user cost of housing typically increases for both homeowners and

renters when they move. Holding other attributes constant,
families with high income and low housing wealth are as likely to

Page 36

move as those with low incomes and high housing wealth. The
median housing equity of families in the first group increases
when they move and the median of the second group decreases. Thus
the typical mover is not liquidity constrained, although

apparently some are. High transaction cost associated with moving
is apparently not the cause of the increase in housing wealth as

the elderly age. Apparently, the absence of a well developed
market for reverse mortgages may be explained by a lack of demand

for these financial instruments. The evidence suggests that the
typical elderly family does not wish to reduce housing wealth to

increase current consumption. For whatever reason, there is
apparently a considerable attachment among homeowners to their
habitual housing.

While our analysis is based on quantitative data, the
conclusions are also consistent with qualitative information from

the KHS. When asked why they moved, only 9 to 14 percent of
homeowners and 15 to 17 percent of renters indicated that the

reason for moving was "to save money". Only 11 percent of
homeowners and 12 percent of renters gave as a reason for wanting
to move that they would like to "reduce cost and work of upkeep".
Observed choices when moves were made confirm these stated
preferences; indeed, saving money was not pervasive.

a. The standard errors have not been adjusted for repeated
observations for the same person.

b. The probability of moving in the base case. It is calculated by
evaluating all variables within the category (age, home equity
and income, retirement status, family status, or health status)
at zero and all other variables at their means. The A
probability for other attributes is the increase or decrease
relative to this base. For example, the probability that a move
occurs if a person retires is 0.046 + 0.055. The probability
associated with the intercept is the probability of moving when
all variables are set to their sample means.
c. Includes single to single, divorced to divorced, and widowed to
widowed.

a. The standard errors have not been adjusted for repeated observations for
the same person.

b. The probability of moving in the base case. It is calculated by
evaluating all variables within the category (age, home equity and
income, retirement status, family status, or health status) at zero and
all other variables at their means. The A probability for other
attributes is the increase or decrease relative to this base. For
example, the probability that a move occurs if a person retires in the
1977-1979 interval is 0.022 + 0.077. The probability associated with
the intercept is the probability of moving when all variables are set to
their sample means.

a. The standard errors have not been adjusted for repeated
observations for the same person.

b.

The probability of moving in the base case. It is calculated by
evaluating all variables within the category (age, home equity
and income, retirement status, family status, or health status)
at zero and all other variables at their means. The 8
probability for other attributes is the increase or decrease
relative to this base. For example, the probability that a move
occurs if a person retires is 0.189 + 0.118. The probability
associated with the intercept is the probability of moving when
all variables are set to their sample means.

a. Includes single to single, divorced to divorced, and widowed to
widowed.
