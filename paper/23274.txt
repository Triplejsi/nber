Demand for Information and Asset Pricing

NBER Working Paper No. 23274
March 2017
JEL No. G12,G14
ABSTRACT
Previously, academics have used the supply of information that arrives to market (e.g.,
macroeconomic announcements, earnings reports, or news releases) to study how information
affects asset prices and anomalies, and for tests of market efficiency. In this paper, we instead use
measures of institutional and retail demand for information. We show that institutional demand
for information is associated with increased trading volume and significant price movements.
Average returns and betas are higher on days with higher institutional demand for information.
The magnitude of these effects is much larger than those associated with the supply of news.
However, the impact of demand for information from retail investors, while statistically
significant, is quite small in magnitude. We also show that higher institutional demand alleviates
mispricing in the market. In particular, higher information processing by institutional investors
dampens momentum and enhances long-term reversals. As such, when demand for information
increases, the market becomes more efficient.

1. Introduction
How information becomes incorporated into asset prices is one of the most fundamental
issues in finance (Grossman and Stiglitz, 1976; Copeland, 1976). Not only does this impact market
efficiency and whether price anomalies persist (La Porta, Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny, 1997;
Engelberg, McLean, and Pontiff, 2016), but the arrival of information appears to be associated
with a risk premium (Savor and Wilson, 2014; and Lucca and Moench, 2015). Intuitively, risk
premia should accrue on days when the arrival of information generates systematic price
movements. This has received much more attention recently by academics, and its effects have
been confirmed empirically (e.g., Savor and Wilson, 2016) and investigated theoretically (Ai and
Bansal, 2017; Andrei, Cujean, and Wilson, 2017).
To study the impact of information on asset prices, a natural place to start is with the supply
of information that arrives to market, such as scheduled macroeconomic announcements, earnings
reports, dividend announcements, or news releases (e.g., Beaver, 1968; Kalay and Loewenstein,
1985, among others). This is reasonable because market participants should update their beliefs
about asset values when news arrives. But, people have limited attention (e.g., Kahneman, 1973,
Hirshleifer and Teoh, 2003). Thus, only considering the supply of information might understate
the effects that new information has on asset prices, risk premia, and anomalies that persist in
financial markets. In addition, focusing on firm-specific news may overlook important information
spillover from related firms.
In this paper, we characterize how demand for information on a stock affects its prices. We
posit that when more demand arises, investors are paying closer attention and information in the
market is more likely to have an effect. We consider both institutional and retail demand for
information, and how they interact with the supply of information in the market. We measure

2

demand shocks from institutions by using data from Bloomberg queries and constructing an
abnormal institutional attention variable (AIA; Ben-Rephael, Da, and Israelsen, 2016). We
measure demand shocks from retail investors by analyzing Google search activity and constructing
a similar variable that captures shocks to retail attention (DSVI; Da, Engelberg, and Gao, 2011).
We begin by analyzing what drives institutional demand for information. Naturally, we
find that when news is released about a particular firm, AIA for that stock is more likely to be
positive. But, demand for information about a particular stock commonly arises when no news
about that firm has been released. Instead, institutional demand for information on individual
stocks also appears to be triggered by industry- and other aggregate news events. We show that
industry-level news, news about large firms, and macroeconomic news (especially FOMC
announcements) are all positively correlated with greater institutional demand for information
about individual stocks. When general news arrives in the market, this is associated with increased
demand for information about individual stocks and provides a channel through which systematic
risk is transmitted across the market. Consistent with this, we show that the CAPM beta is roughly
28% higher on days with institutional demand for information on that stock. 1 In contrast, after
controlling for institutional demand for information, the supply of news has no statistically
significant effect on systematic risk.
This motivates us to examine whether demand for information is associated with a risk
premium. We show this to be the case. Days in which there is a spike in demand for information
are associated with a risk premium, even after controlling for both earnings announcement days
and days with major news. In fact, the average daily risk premium that accrues on positive AIA

1

This is also consistent with Peng and Xiong (2006) who show that limited investor attention leads to
category-learning behavior, i.e., investors tend to process more market and sector-wide information than firm-specific
information. Consequently, demand for firm-specific information likely coincides with that of aggregate information
and carries systematic implications.

days is much larger than for days with a spike in the supply of information (16 vs. 5 basis points).
Strikingly, these results are almost identical when we compare days with a demand shock with no
supply of information to days with news, but no demand (14 vs. 4 basis points).
These findings are consistent with the notion that institutional demand for information on
a stock without firm-specific news can be triggered by aggregate news and therefore results in a
risk premium. Alternatively, the finding provides evidence that limited attention is likely present
in the market: some news supply may take time before it is completely incorporated into prices
and that the demand for information is an important driver of asset prices.
While spikes in retail attention are associated with a statistically significant average daily
risk premium, its magnitude is low (1 basis point). We further investigate the interaction of
institutional and retail demand for information and find that retail attention has very little impact
on asset prices. On days when AIA is absent, retail demand for information does not command a
risk premium. It is only when AIA is present that there is a relationship. This provides evidence
that retail participation in the market has little permanent effect on prices, and certainly does not
provide a countervailing effect in the market.
Finally, we study the impact of both the demand for information and its supply on
mispricing following the methodology in Engelberg, McLean, and Pontiff (2016). We focus on
two related and economically important anomalies that were present during our sample period:
momentum (Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993) and long-term reversal (De Bondt and Thaler, 1985).
While both anomalies accrue over relatively long holding periods, we examine whether they
accrue proportionally more on some days than others. Ex ante, two competing hypotheses might
be true. The first is that days with AIA might exacerbate momentum because institutional investors
invest in assets with short-term trends to take advantage of retail investors who are paying less

4

attention. The second is that when institutional investors demand and process information, they
correct for mispricing, which makes the market more efficient and dampens momentum.
We find evidence of the latter: demand for information weakens momentum and enhances
long-term reversal, which is consistent with Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998) who
argue that mispricing can be exacerbated in the medium term, resulting in momentum, and
corrected in the long term, resulting in reversals. By demanding and processing information,
institutional investors help to correct mispricing, therefore enhance reversal by pushing the price
to its fundamental value but dampen momentum by alleviating continuing overreaction. Retail
demand for information and variables that parameterize the supply of information have no such
effect in our sample.
Our paper makes several contributions to the literature on information and asset pricing.
Our paper is the first to examine the impact of the demand for information on the risk premium.
We find that the demand for information by institutional investors is of first-order importance in
explaining when stocks earn a risk premium. Moreover, we find that institutional demand responds
to both firm news and important industry and market news. This provides an intuitive link between
the demand of information and systematic risk. When important industry, aggregate, or
macroeconomic news arrives, institutional investors are more likely to demand and process
information at the individual stock level, which results in transmission of systematic risk. Finally,
we also contribute to the literature on anomalies. We show that when demand for information is
high, stock prices become more efficient. In addition, the impact of information processing on
anomalies varies depending on the nature of the anomaly.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the data and
provide sample statistics. In Section 3, we analyze the determinants of the demand for information,

5

and how demand and supply affect trading volume, price movements, firm betas, and risk premia.
Section 4 analyzes momentum and long-term price reversals. Section 5 examines the role played
by institutional ownership. Section 6 concludes.

2. Data and Sample Statistics
2.1 Sample Construction
Bloomberg provides data that include transformed measures of news reading and news
searching activity on Bloomberg’s terminals. The majority of Bloomberg terminal users are likely
to be institutional investors who have both the incentives and financial resources to quickly react
to important news about a firm (Ben-Rephael, Da and Israelsen, 2016). Based on data availability,
our sample period ranges from February 2010-December 2015. 2 Following Da, Engelberg, and
Gao (2011), we begin with the sample of Russell 3000 stocks. We then require stocks in our sample
to satisfy the following conditions: (1) have measures of news-searching and news-reading activity
on Bloomberg terminals and Google search engine; (2) have a share code of 10 or 11 in the Center
for Research in Securities Prices (CRSP) database; (3) have stock prices greater than or equal to
$5 at the end of the previous month; (4) have book-to-market information for the DGTW risk
adjustment (Daniel, Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers, 1997). After applying these conditions, we
end up with 2,549 stocks and 1,949,960 day-stock observations.

2.2 Measures of the Demand for Information
Our two measures of demand for information are based on institutional and retail attention.
In order to construct their own measure of attention, Bloomberg records the number of times news

2

Bloomberg’s historical attention measures begin on 2/17/2010. Historical data are missing for the periods of
12/6/2010 – 1/7/2011 and 8/17/2011 – 11/2/2011.

6

articles on a particular stock are read by its terminal users and the number of times users actively
search for news about a specific stock. Searching for news requires users to actively type the firm’s
stock ticker symbol followed by the function “CN” (Company News). In contrast, users may read
an article without initially realizing it refers to a specific firm. In order to place more emphasis on
deliberate news seeking for a specific firm, Bloomberg assigns a score of 10 when users search for
news and 1 when users read a news article. These numbers are then aggregated into hourly counts.
Using the hourly counts, Bloomberg then creates a numerical attention score each hour by
comparing the average hourly count during the previous 8 hours to all hourly counts over the
previous month for the same stock. They assign a score of 0 if the rolling average is in the lowest
80% of the hourly counts over the previous 30 days. Similarly, Bloomberg assigns a score of 1, 2,
3 or 4 if the average is between 80% and 90%, 90% and 94%, 94% and 96%, or greater than 96%
of the previous 30 days’ hourly counts, respectively. Finally, Bloomberg aggregates up to the daily
frequency by taking a maximum of all hourly scores throughout the calendar day. Bloomberg
provides these latter transformed scores, but does not provide the raw hourly counts or scores.
The data appendix contains detailed instructions explaining how to download the data from
the Bloomberg terminal. 3 Since we are interested in abnormal attention, and not just the level of
attention, our abnormal institutional attention measure (AIA) measure is a dummy variable that
takes a value of 1 if Bloomberg’s daily maximum is 3 or 4, and 0 otherwise. This captures the right
tail of the measure’s distribution. In other words, an AIA equal to one indicates the existence of
institutional investor attention shock on that stock during that day. The dummy variable allows
easier interpretation of the differential impact of high vs. low institutional attention shocks on

economic outcomes. Ben-Rephael et al. (2016) provide evidence that AIA facilitates the
incorporation of information into prices.
Following Da et al. (2011), retail attention is measured using the daily Google Search
Volume Index (DSVI). Abnormal DSVI (ADSVI) is calculated as the natural log of the ratio of
DSVI to the average of DSVI over the previous month. To facilitate the comparison with AIA which
is a dummy variable, we also create a dummy variable version of ADSVI following Bloomberg’s
methodology (DADSVI). Specifically, we assign DSVI on day t one of the potential 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4
scores using the firm’s past 30 trading day DSVI values. For example, if DSVI on day t is in the
lowest 80% of past DSVI values, it receives the score 0. Then, on day t, the dummy variable
DADSVI is set to one if the score is 3 or 4, and 0 otherwise. In other words, a DADSVI of one
indicates a spike in retail attention on that day.

2.3 Measures of the Supply of Information
Our two measures of the supply of information are based on general news and earnings
announcements. We obtain news coverage of our sample stocks from RavenPack. To facilitate the
economical comparison with AIA and DADSVI, we construct a dummy variable, denoted as NDAY,
which is equal to one for stock i if a news article about the firm is published on the Dow Jones
Newswire on day t and zero otherwise. Because we want to distinguish earnings announcements
from other news, we set NDAY equal to zero on earnings announcement days. We obtain earning
announcements dates from I/B/E/S. Similar to NDAY, we construct a dummy variable, denoted as
EDAY, which is equal to one for stock i on days when the firm announces earnings and zero
otherwise.

8

For each firm we calculate the value-weighted averages of NDAY and EDAY for other firms
in the same (Fama French 48) industry, which we call FF48_NDAY and FF48_EDAY,
respectively. In addition, we create two similar variables, AGG_NDAY, and AGG_EDAY, which
capture the value-weighted averages of NDAY and EDAY using all firms in the sample on a given
day.
Finally, we include several measures based on important macroeconomic news
announcements. Because there are macroeconomic announcements almost every day, we limit
ourselves to those that draw the most attention from institutional investors on Bloomberg
terminals. 4 Those include announcements of nonfarm payroll (which we denote as NFP), the
producer price index (PPI), the Federal Open Market Committee rate decision (FOMC), the
“advance” forecast of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and the Institute for Supply
Management Manufacturing Index (ISM). Announcement dates and times are all from Bloomberg.
For each of these five announcements, we create dummy variables equal to one on announcement
days and zero on other days. In addition to the five individual dummy variables, we also create the
dummy variable MACRO which is set equal to one on days when at least one of the five
announcement dummies is equal to one and zero otherwise.
In terms of timing, NDAY and EDAY are defined based on market trading hours. In
particular, day t is a news day for firm i if the timestamp of the news article is between 4 p.m. on
day t-1 and 4 p.m. on day t. Similarly, day t is an earnings announcement day for firm i if the firm

4

For macro announcements, attention is measured based on Bloomberg’s “relevance score” which represents the
number of “alerts” set on Bloomberg Terminals for an economic event relative to all alerts set for the 130 macro
events in the U.S. Users can choose to be alerted to different types of announcement events.

announces its earnings during the period from 4 p.m. on day t-1 to 4 p.m. on day t. The time stamps
associated with earnings announcements are obtained from I/B/E/S. 5
Other variables used in our analysis are constructed from Compustat and CRSP. Table 1
defines all of the variables used in this paper.

Insert Table 1 about here.

2.4 Summary Statistics
Panel A of Table 2 provides summary statistics. The average frequency of AIA across
stocks is 0.088 in the full sample suggesting that the average stock in our sample experiences an
information demand shock from institutional investors on 8.8% of all trading days. The average
frequency of information demand shocks by retail investors is similar at 0.087.

Insert Table 2 about here.

Exploring the supply of information variables, for a typical firm in our sample, about one
day out of four is a news day on average. Not surprisingly, firms have an average of four earnings
announcement days per year.
Because we exclude stocks with prices less than $5, the typical firm is not small. The
average (median) size is around 7.1 (1.4) billion. On average, $60 million dollars’ worth of shares

5

According to Michaely, Rubin, and Vedrashko (2014), these time stamps are very accurate and should result in very
few misclassification errors at a daily frequency. Stock returns on day t are measured from the market close
(4 p.m.) on day t-1 to the market close (4 p.m.) on day t. AIA and DADSVI on day t are measured during the 24 hours
on that calendar day.

10

are traded per day for a given stock. Finally, the mean (median) daily return in our sample is 4.3
(5.7) basis points.
Panel B of Table 2 provides cross-tabulations for each pair of the four information supply
and demand based on percentages of all day-stock observations as well as cross-tabulations
including the dummy variables DEMAND, and SUPPLY which are set equal to 1 at least one of
the corresponding demand or supply measures is equal to 1, and 0 otherwise. The bottom right
cross tab shows that for a given stock, there is a demand shock on about 20% of all days and a
supply shock on about 28% of all days. About 40% of the day-stock observations include either a
supply or demand shock.
The four cross-tabs on the left examine AIA. There is a slightly positive relation between
AIA and DADSVI. The correlation coefficient of AIA and DADSVI is only 3.2% and only 1.4% of
day-stock observations include demand shocks by both institutional and retail investors. By
contrast, the relation between AIA and information supply is stronger with correlation coefficients
with NDAY and EDAY of 11% and 23%, respectively.
The second cross-tab on the left side shows that institutional demand shocks are more likely
to come on days with and without (non-earnings-announcement) news and only about 16% of
news days draw abnormal attention. The third cross tab on the left side shows that about 2/3 of
earnings days coincide with institutional demand shocks. In the next section, we examine how
each of these sub-cases is related to the risk premium.
The final cross-tab on the left shows that days with institutional demand shocks are split
evenly between days with and without supply shocks.

11

The right column of cross tabs-examine pairs of the remaining three measures. There is a
weak, positive relation between DADSVI and the supply measures. By construction, earnings days
are orthogonal to news days.

3. Demand for Information, Systematic Risk, and the Risk Premium
3.1 Information Demand and Supply
We examine the relation between the demand for information and the risk premium. We
first examine what drives institutional demand shocks. In Table 3, we regress AIA on measures of
information supply at the firm, industry and macroeconomic level. Our firm-level measures are
NDAY and EDAY. To capture important news at the industry level, we include the variables
FF48_NDAY and FF48_EDAY. The variables AGG_NDAY and AGG_EDAY capture aggregate
news and earnings announcements, placing more importance on larger firms. We also include
either our five macroeconomic announcement dummy variables, NFP, PPI, FOMC, GDP, and
ISM, or the combined MACRO dummy variable. Additionally, we include day-of-the-week
dummies to capture seasonality in attention that been previously documented (DellaVigna and
Pollet, 2009; Liu and Peng, 2015; and Ben-Rephael et al. 2016), and the retail attention measure,
DADSVI. Finally, we include combinations of firm level characteristics and AbsRet. The table
presents the results of these Logit panel regressions.

Insert Table 3 about here.

In general, we find firm- and industry-level news and earnings announcements to be related
to greater institutional demand for information. The results suggest that in periods with more firm-

12

level news and news about firms in the industry or the entire market, institutional investors are
more likely to demand information for a stock. This is intuitive given that news about firms in an
industry may have important implications for other firms in the industry.
Additionally, we find that when there is more news about large firms in the wider market,
demand for information is more likely to be high. News about large firms may have systematic
implications for other stocks, even when these firms are in different industries... Finally, in all
cases, earnings news is more important for information demand than other news. Note, however,
that the frequency of earnings announcements is significantly lower.
Focusing on macro news, the first three specifications include the MACRO dummy
variable, while the final three include dummy variables for the five individual macroeconomic
announcements. These events generally coincide with institutional demand shocks. The FOMC
rate announcements seem to draw the most attention.
In sum, the collective evidence suggests that when there is news about other important
firms in the industry, news about large firms in general, or macroeconomic news, institutional
investors are more likely to demand information for a given stock. Hence, shocks in investor
demand are related to news that is systematic in nature. This response of institutional demand to
information provides a channel through which systematic risk is transmitted across the market.

3.2 Demand for Information, Trading Volume, Price Volatility and Firm Betas
In Table 4, we examine the impact of both information supply and information demand
on trading volume and price movement. In particular, we expect information demand shocks to be
associated with higher trading volume and larger price movements. The key point is to compare
the economic magnitude across the different measures.

13

The first set of columns present coefficients for Fama MacBeth (1973) regressions of four
abnormal volume measures on AIA, DADSVI, NDAY and EDAY. The first three measures –
AbnVol_63, AbnVol_126, and AbnVol_252 – measure the stock’s abnormal trading volume
calculated following Barber and Odean (2008) as the stock’s daily volume divided by the previous
63-, 126-, and 252-day average trading volume, respectively. The fourth measure of abnormal
trading volume, DAVOL, is a dummy variable that is equal to one if trading volume is abnormal
and 0 otherwise. The measure is calculated using the same methodology used to create DADSVI.
For all four measures, earnings announcement days are associated with the most abnormal
trading volume. Coefficients are about 3 times as large as those on AIA. However, since days with
abnormal institutional investor attention are 6 times as common as earnings announcement days
(see Table 2), AIA is associated with more aggregate abnormal trading volume for a given firm.
Days with news and days with abnormal retail attention are also associated with higher abnormal
volume, but the economic magnitude is relatively small.

Insert Table 4 about here.

The final three columns of the table measure the impact of information supply and demand
shocks on price movement. We examine absolute returns (AbsRet), absolute DGTW adjusted
returns (AbsDGTW), and squared returns (Ret^2). As was the case with abnormal volume, days
earnings announcement days see the largest price movements. On average, prices move by 267
basis points. On days with an information demand shock by institutional investors, prices move
by an additional 85 basis points. For all three measures, the next most important event is the supply

14

of news. Finally, retail attention is also associated with more absolute price movement, but the
economic magnitude is small, around 6-7 basis points.

We next examine whether systematic risk is higher on days with information demand
shocks or information supply shocks. Specifically, estimate a time varying factor loading CAPM
beta model for each stock using variations of the following model:
𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖1 × 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖2 × 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 × 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖3 × 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 × 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑡𝑡
+ 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖4 × 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 × 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖5 × 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 × 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

where ERet is the stock return minus the risk free rate (in basis points), and MKTRF is the market
return minus the risk free rate (in basis points).

Insert Table 5 about here.

The first three specifications in Table 5 report the equally weighted cross-sectional means
of firm level time-series regressions. Betas on days with no supply or demand shocks are about 1,
on average. In the first specification, we interact the two information demand shock dummy
variables with the market excess return. The table shows that CAPM beta is higher by about 0.28
(0.13) on days with information demand by institutional (retail) investors.
In the second specification, we include only interactions with information supply day
measures. Betas are higher for both measures and statistically significant. However, as shown in
specification 3, after controlling for information demand, the relations are no longer statistically
significant.

15

In the final three specifications in Table 5, we estimate our model using panel regressions
with stock-level fixed effects and standard errors clustered by date. The results are similar to those
from the time-series regressions with two exceptions. First, the magnitudes are lower on the
coefficients of the interaction terms. In particular, the CAPM beta is higher by about 0.16 (0.03)
on days with information demand by institutional (retail) investors. Second, there is some evidence
of

a

higher

beta

on

earnings

announcement

days,

as

seen

in

specification 5. However, once we control for information demand, the coefficient estimate is no
longer significant.
Overall, we confirm that not only is there more abnormal trading and absolute price
movement on days with information demand shocks, there is also more systematic risk.

3.3 Demand for Information and the Risk Premium
Having established that AIA is associated with higher trading volume, price movement and
beta loadings, we next explore whether days with AIA shocks are associated with a risk premium.

Insert Table 6 about here.

To explore this, in Table 6, we run Fama-MacBeth (1973) cross sectional regressions of
daily stock returns on information supply and demand measures as well as various control
variables, including 10 lags of returns, squared returns, trading volume, and NDAY. The first two
specifications of Panel A present results using the information supply variables. News days are
associated with an (additional) risk premium of about 5-6 basis points. This number is statistically
significant at the 1% level and can be compared to the baseline premium of about 12 or 13 basis

16

points on days with no news. We do not find a significant premium on days with earnings
announcements.
In specifications 3 and 4, we examine the two information demand measures. We find that
days with abnormal demand for information by institutional investors are associated with an
additional risk premium of about 16 basis points per day. Based on the baseline risk premium, that
suggests that an overall risk premium of about 30 basis points on these days. Interestingly, days
with abnormal demand from retail investors are also associated with a positive return, however,
the magnitude is only around 1 basis point.
Specifications 5 and 6 include all four measures of supply and demand. Once we account
for all four measures, we confirm that days with information demand by institutional investors are
associated with the highest risk premium.
To investigate the source of the impact of AIA on risk premiums, we divide AIA into two
components: PREDICTED_AIA, which is defined as the fitted value of AIA based on the Logit
model in specification 3 of Table 3, and RESIDUAL_AIA, which is equal to the difference in AIA
and PREDICTED_AIA. RESIDUAL_AIA has a sample mean of 0.10 and standard deviation of
0.12 while PREDICTED_AIA has a sample mean and standard deviation of 0.00 and 0.28,
respectively. Specification 7 of Panel A reports results of regressing returns on these two variables
as well as lags of returns, returns squared and news. The results indicate that both
PREDICTED_AIA and RESIDUAL_AIA are positively related to risk premiums.
Because there may be abnormal supply and demand on the same day (i.e., investors tend
to demand information when there is news), we next examine the incremental impact of the four
measures of supply and demand independent of each other. Because AIA appears to have the
biggest impact on the risk premium, we further explore the interaction of AIA with the other three

17

variables, DADSVI, NDAY, and EDAY. Recall, that all four are dummy variables. Thus, we focus
on cases where one variable is equal to 1 and the other is equal to 0 and when both are equal to
one. The relative frequencies of each of these cases can be seen in Panel B of Table 2.
We reports the results in Panel B, where we extend Panel A’s analysis by including the
interaction terms. The first two columns of Panel B examine the impact of the interplay between
institutional and retail demand for information on the risk premium. As can be seen by the
coefficients on the three interaction dummies, when there is abnormal institutional demand for
information, but no abnormal retail demand, the risk premium is about 14 basis points higher than
the baseline. By contrast, when there is no abnormal demand for information by institutional
investors, but there is a retail demand shock, there is no additional risk premium. Only when
abnormal retail attention is accompanied by institutional attention is there an additional premium
of about 20 basis points per day. The 6 basis points difference is not statistically significant.
Specifications 3 and 4 examine the interplay between institutional demand and the supply
of news. When there is the supply of information, but no institutional demand shock, the risk
premium is about 4 basis points higher. Strikingly, when there is abnormal demand for information
by institutional investors, but no news, the risk premium is 14 basis points higher; and the
difference of 12 basis points is statistically significant. Moreover, the AIA1_NDAY1 coefficient
indicates that when there is both the supply of news and institutional demand, the additional risk
premium is larger, at 20 to 21 basis points. However, this difference is not statistically significant
than the case with only an institutional attention shock.
The final two specifications show that the additional risk premium when there is abnormal
institutional attention is not driven by earnings announcements. While there is weak evidence of
an additional premium when earnings announcements are accompanied by an attention shock, the

18

statistically significant coefficients on the variable AIA1_EDAY0 confirm that the most important
determinant of the risk premium is not the supply of information, but the demand for information.
In the next section, we examine whether information supply or demand help mitigate or exacerbate
mispricing.

4. Demand for Information and Mispricing
To study the impact of both the supply of information and the demand for information on
mispricing, we focus on two related and well-known “anomalies”: momentum, and long-term
reversal. Daniel, Hirshleifer and Subrahmanyam (1998) propose a unified behavioral explanation
of momentum and long-run reversal. In particular, overconfidence together with biased selfattribution could lead to these price effects. Given the recent body of literature on anomalies (e.g.,
Stambaugh, Yu and Yuan, 2015, Stambaugh and Yuan 2016, and Engberg, McLean and Pontiff,
2016), it is of interest to examine whether shocks in information demand by institutional investors
aid in reducing mispricing.
To construct the momentum scores, for each stock in our sample and at the end of month
t-1, we calculate the cumulative stock return during months t-12 to t-2. We then rank all stocks
based on these cumulative returns, and transform the ranking to a continuous scale ranging
between -1 and 1. A momentum score of 1 refers to the stock with the highest past return and -1
refers to the stock with the lowest past return. We call this continuous variable Momentum. Based
on the momentum strategy, stocks with Momentum scores closer to 1 should continue to
outperform stocks with Momentum scores closer to -1.

19

If the momentum effect is associated with overreaction, we would expect abnormal demand
for information by institutional investors to mitigate this effect. In other words, we expect that on
days when institutional investors are paying close attention, returns of stocks with high Momentum
scores should have negative returns relative to stocks with low Momentum scores. Thus, a negative
coefficient on the interaction between momentum and the supply/demand measure is consistent
with the mitigation of mispricing. Table 7 provides estimates of these coefficients. The first two
specifications examine information demand. The second two examine information supply, and
the final two examine both.

Insert Table 7 about here.

Specifications 1 and 2 show that when there is an information demand shock by
institutional investors, past winners have stock returns that are about 6 basis points lower than past
losers. In contrast, retail investor demand doesn’t seem to have an effect. Exploring the impact of
information supply, the next two specifications show no statistically significant difference in
returns for past winners and past losers. The final set of columns, which include all four measures,
confirm the previous results. In fact, the coefficients on the interaction between Momentum and
AIA are even slightly larger. Thus, of the four information supply and demand measures, only AIA
has an impact on mispricing. In this case, its role is consistent with a reduction of overreaction. If
momentum is driven by overreaction, and given that we find evidence that AIA reduces this
overreaction, we next test whether AIA facilitates long-term reversals.
To examine the impact of information supply and demand on long-term reversal, we create
a measure of long-term reversal that is analogous to the momentum measure. In particular, for

20

each stock at the end of month t-1, we calculate cumulative returns for months t-60 through t-13
and rank each stock based on these returns. Since past long-term winners tend to underperform
past long-term losers, we assign the stock with the highest past return a score of -1 and the stock
with the lowest past return a score of 1. We name this continuous variable Reversal and repeat the
analysis from Table 6, substituting Reversal for Momentum. Table 8 reports the results.

Insert Table 8 about here.

The first two specifications examine whether the demand for information helps reduce
mispricing. The main estimates of interest are the coefficients on the interactions between Reversal
and AIA and DADSVI. The positive and significant coefficients on the interaction with AIA provide
evidence that institutional demand for information helps reduce mispricing. Specifically, when
there is abnormal attention by institutional investors, past long term losers tend to outperform past
long-term winners by about 8-9 basis points per day. We find some evidence that retail attention
plays a similar role, though the results are economically weaker and only significant in one of the
two specifications.
Specifications 3 and 4 show that the supply of information may reduce mispricing. In
particular, on news days, past long-term losers outperform past long-term winners by about
2 basis points per day. However, as was the case with Momentum, once we control for all four
measures of supply and demand in the last two columns, only AIA seems to matter.

5. Institutional Ownership, Risk Premium and Mispricing

21

In this section, we examine whether the results on the role of information supply and
demand on the risk premium and mispricing vary based on the composition of a stock’s
shareholders. Specifically, each month, we split the stocks in our sample into two groups based
on whether the institutional ownership is below median (denoted Low InstOwn) or above median
(denoted High InstOwn). We then run the analyses on the risk premium, momentum, and longterm reversal. Table 9 provides these estimates.

Insert Table 9 about here.

Specifications (1) and (2) examine the risk premium for low and high institutional
ownership stocks. Low InstOwn stocks have an additional risk premium of about 19 basis points
on days with institutional demand shocks, while High InstOwn stocks have an additional risk
premium of 12 basis points. The difference of 7 basis points is statistically significant. We further
find that the effect of retail demand shocks on stock prices is about 2 basis points for Low InstOwn
stocks, and basically 0 for the High InstOwn stocks. The difference between the two premium
estimates is only marginally significant. Finally, the risk premium on news days is also larger for
Low InstOwn stocks, with a premium of 6 basis points compared to 3 basis points for the high
InstOwn stocks, and the difference is also statistically significant.
The next two specifications examine mispricing in the form of momentum. The role of AIA
in reducing overreaction to past returns seems to be economically stronger for low institutional
ownership. However, the difference between the two samples is not statistically significance. In
contrast, focusing on Reversal (Specifications 5 and 6), we find that the difference in the effect of
AIA between the low and high samples is statistically significant. In particular, on days with

22

abnormal institutional attention, past long-term winners underperform winners by about 13 basis
points in the Low InstOwn sample, compared to 4 basis points in the High InstOwn sample.
To recap, overall, the results indicate that information demand shocks are associated with
larger risk premiums, reduce overreaction to past returns, and aid in reversion of stock returns are
much stronger in stocks with low institutional ownership.

6. Conclusion
Understanding the relation between information and asset pricing is fundamentally
important. Recent evidence suggests that the arrival of information is associated with a risk
premium (Savor and Wilson, 2014; and Lucca and Moench, 2015).
Exploring this relation, researchers have focused on information supply measures such as
scheduled macroeconomic announcements, earnings reports, and news releases. Since investors
have limited attention (e.g., Kahneman, 1973), we argue that only considering the supply of
information might understate the effects that new information has on asset prices. Consequently,
we add to this growing literature by exploring the effect of investor demand for information.
As our main information demand measure, we use Ben-Rephael, Da and Israelsen (2016)’s
abnormal institutional attention measure (AIA), which captures demand shocks from institutions
by using data from news-reading and news-searching activity on Bloomberg Terminals.
Exploring the relation between the demand for information and information supply, we
find that AIA responds to both firm-level news and important industry- and market-level news.
This provides an intuitive link between the demand for information at the stock level and
systematic risk. Consistent with that, we find that AIA is associated with higher trading volume,
more price volatility and higher CAPM betas.

23

Motivated by these findings, we explore the relation between information demand and the
risk premium and find that the demand for information is indeed associated with a risk premium.
Importantly, this relation is much stronger than the effect of information supply.
Finally, we explore whether institutional investor demand for information is also associated
with correction of mispricing. Focusing on two economically important anomalies, momentum
and long-term reversal, we show that AIA weakens momentum and enhances long-term reversal,
which is consistent with Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998).
In sum, our paper makes several contributions to the asset pricing literature. First, we show
that demand for information plays an important role. Second, our results provide a channel through
which systematic risk is transmitted across the market. Finally, we provide evidence that when
demand for information is high, stock prices become more efficient.

Bloomberg records the number of times news articles on a particular stock are read by its
terminal users and the number of times users actively search for news for a specific stock.
Bloomberg then assigns a value of 1 for each article read and 10 for each news search. These
numbers are then aggregated into an hourly count. Using the hourly count, Bloomberg then
creates a numerical attention score each hour by comparing past 8-hour average count to all
hourly counts over the previous month for the same stock. They assign a value of 0 if the
rolling average is in the lowest 80% of the hourly counts over the previous 30 days. Similarly,
Bloomberg assigns a score of 1, 2, 3 or 4 if the average is between 80% and 90%, 90% and
94%, 94% and 96%, or greater than 96% of the previous 30 days’ hourly counts, respectively.
Finally, Bloomberg aggregates up to the daily frequency by taking a maximum of all hourly
scores throughout the day. These are the data provided to us by Bloomberg. Since we are
interested in abnormal attention, our AIA measure is a dummy variable that receives a value
of 1 if Bloomberg’s score is 3 or 4, and 0 otherwise. This captures the right tail of the
measure’s distribution.
Dummy variable equal to one on days with an announcement of the Institute for Supply

We follow Bloomberg’s methodology and assign Google’s daily search volume index (DSVI)
on day t one of the potential 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 scores using the firm’s past 30 trading day DSVI
values. For example, if DSVI on day t is in the lowest 80% of past DSVI values, it receives
the score 0. DADSVI is equal to one on day t if the score is 3 or 4, and 0 otherwise.

Table 3. Determinants of Institutional Demand
The table reports results from Logit panel regressions of the Abnormal Institutional Attention measure (AIA)
from Bloomberg on information demand by retail investors (DADSVI), various measures of information supply
and additional control variables. All variables are defined in Table 1. DADSVI is based on Google’s daily Search
Volume Index. The information supply measures include a news day dummy (NDAY) and an earnings
announcement day dummy (EDAY). Also included are the value weighted average of NDAY for firm i'’s (Fama
French 48) industry (excluding firm i) (FF48_NDAY), and a similar measure using earnings announcements
(FF48_ENDAY) as well as value weighted measures at the market level for news (AGG_NDAY) and earnings
announcements (AGG_EDAY). The first three specifications include a dummy variable indicating that that there
was at least one of five major macroeconomic news announcements that day (MACRO). The last three
specifications include individual dummy variables for each of the five macroeconomic news announcements:
Nonfarm Payroll (NFP), Producer Price Index (PPI), the FOMC rate announcement (FOMC), the advance
estimate for GDP (GDP), and the ISM Manufacturing index (ISM). Macroeconomic announcement dates are
from Bloomberg. Additional control variables include the natural logarithm of the firm’s market capitalization
(LnSize); the natural logarithm of the firm’s book-to-market ratio (LnBM); the stock’s level of institutional
ownership (InstOwn); the absolute return of the stock (AbsRet); and day-of-the week dummy variables Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Standard errors, clustered by stock, are reported in parentheses. Statistical
significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level is indicated with *, **, and ***, respectively.

Table 4. Information Supply and Demand, Trading Volume, and Stock Price Movements
The table reports results from Fama-MacBeth (1973) cross sectional regressions of various measures of trading
volume (“Volume Measures”) and stock price movements (“Price Measures”) on measures of information
supply, information demand and additional control variables. All variables are defined in Table 1. The two
information demand measures are the Abnormal Institutional Attention measure (AIA) from Bloomberg and the
abnormal retail attention dummy (DADSVI) based on Google’s daily Search Volume Index. The two information
supply measures are a news day dummy (NDAY) and an earnings announcement day dummy (EDAY). Additional
control variables include the natural logarithm of the firm’s market capitalization (LnSize); the natural logarithm
of the firm’s book-to-market ratio (LnBM); Ten lags of returns, squared returns, and trading volume. Standard
errors estimated using the Newey-West adjustment with 10 lags are reported in parentheses. Statistical
significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level is indicated with *, **, and ***, respectively.

Table 5. Information Supply and Demand and Betas
The table reports results from regressions of daily excess stock returns on excess market returns and on
interactions of excess market returns with measures of information supply and information demand. All variables
are defined in Table 1. Excess return (ERet) is measured relative to the risk free rate (RF). Both the market excess
return (MKTRF) and the risk free rate are from Ken French’s website. The two information demand measures
are the Abnormal Institutional Attention measure (AIA) from Bloomberg and the abnormal retail attention
dummy (DADSVI) based on Google’s daily Search Volume Index. The two information supply measures are a
news day dummy (NDAY) and an earnings announcement day dummy (EDAY). The first set of columns include
cross-sectional means from time-series regressions at the firm level. The second set columns include estimates
from panel regressions. For the panel regressions, stock fixed effects are included and standard errors (reported
in parentheses) are clustered by date. Statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level is indicated with *,
**, and ***, respectively.

Table 6. Information Supply and Demand and the Risk Premium
The table reports results from Fama-MacBeth (1973) cross sectional regressions of daily returns on measures of
information supply, information demand and additional control variables. All variables are defined in Table 1.
The two information demand measures are the Abnormal Institutional Attention measure (AIA) from Bloomberg
and the abnormal retail attention dummy (DADSVI) based on Google’s daily Search Volume Index. Additionally,
the variables PREDICTED_AIA and RESIDUAL_AIA are the fitted and residual values, respectively, from the
model in specification 3 of Table 3. The two information supply measures are a news day dummy (NDAY) and
an earnings announcement day dummy (EDAY). Panel A reports the information supply and demand main
effects. Panel B also includes the interaction terms between AIA and DADSVI, NDAY and EDAY, respectively.
Consider, for example, the interaction between AIA and NDAY. We focus on the following three cases: AIA
equals to 0 and the other dummy variable equals to 1 (denoted as AIA0_NDAY1); AIA equals to 1 and the other
dummy variable equals to 0 (denoted as AIA1_NDAY0); and AIA equals to 1 and the other dummy variable equal
to 1 (denoted as AIA1_NDAY1). Additional control variables include the natural logarithm of the firm’s market
capitalization (LnSize); the natural logarithm of the firm’s book-to-market ratio (LnBM). When indicated, we
also control for ten lags of returns, squared returns, and trading volume. Standard errors estimated using the
Newey-West adjustment with 10 lags are reported in parentheses. Statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and
1% level is indicated with *, **, and ***, respectively.

Table 9. Institutional Ownership, Information Demand, and Asset Pricing
The table repeats the main specifications from the analysis conducted in Tables 6, 7, and 8 after splitting the
sample into firms with Low and High levels of Institutional Ownership (InstOwn) as measured at the end of the
previous quarter. As defined in Table 1, Momentum is a continuous variable ranging between -1 and 1, indicating
the relative ranking at the end of month t-1 of the cumulative returns from month t-12 to month t-2; where 1 (1) refers to the highest (lowest) past return. Reversal is a continuous variable ranging between -1 and 1, indicating
the relative ranking at the end of month t-1 of the cumulative returns from month t-60 to month t-13; where 1 (1) refers to the lowest (highest) past return. Standard errors estimated using the Newey-West adjustment with
10 lags are reported in parentheses. Statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level is indicated with *, **,
and ***, respectively.
