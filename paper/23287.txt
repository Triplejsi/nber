ABSTRACT
What is the relationship between bank capital, the risk of a financial crisis, and its severity? This
paper introduces the first comprehensive analysis of the long-run evolution of the capital structure
of modern banking using newly constructed data for banks’ balance sheets in 17 countries since
1870. In addition to establishing stylized facts on the changing funding mix of banks, we study
the nexus between capital structure and financial instability. We find no association between
higher capital and lower risk of banking crisis. However, economies with better capitalized
banking systems recover faster from financial crises as credit begins to flow back more readily.

Introduction

Systemic banking crises are a recurring phenomenon in modern economic history. Recent
macro-finance research points to a general pattern where buoyant conditions in credit
markets, measured by increases in the quantity of credit (Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor,
2013; Mian, Sufi, and Verner, 2017; Schularick and Taylor, 2012), or by low expected
returns on credit assets (Krishnamurthy and Muir, 2016), presage banking crises and severe
downturns. A key question for macroprudential regulators is whether higher capital ratios
are associated with lower crisis risks, or at least will alleviate their economic fallout. Their
instinct is to increase the loss-absorption capacity of banks, at least in recent years. However
as we will show, financial crises have overwhelmed even the highest of defenses.
Bankers have an incentive to take excessive risks if the payouts from their bets are
asymmetric and creditors do not monitor banks closely (Merton, 1977). A remedy might be
to increase equity capital: more skin in the game should induce more prudent behavior and
thereby reduce the probability that financial institutions will face large losses that put their
existence at risk (Holmstrom and Tirole, 1997; Mehran and Thakor, 2011). But this view has
not gone unchallenged. Rajan (2018) raised fundamental doubts whether equity governance
is able to discipline banks ex ante. The regulatory response to the global financial crisis has,
by and large, embraced higher capital buffers and regulation of bank leverage. This is not
the first time that capital ratios have been raised in response to a systemic banking crisis, as
Grossman (2010) reports. But despite all regulatory efforts, crises have not gone away.
A competing explanation for why financial crises happen starts from the observation
that when credit booms are underway, neither financial markets nor the bankers themselves
are necessarily aware that the risks on the balance sheets are rising. Recent research by
Baron and Xiong (2017), Fahlenbrach et al. (2017), as well as Cheng et al. (2014) documents
evidence of overoptimism by insiders and market-wide neglect of crash risk during credit
booms. These findings mesh well with the older insights of Kindleberger (1978), Minsky
(1977, 1986), and Shiller (2000) where, time and again, financial markets have become
overly exuberant only to be disappointed later. They also echo the ideas proposed in recent
theoretical work by Bordalo et al. (2018), Simsek (2013), as well as Greenwood et al. (2018).
In line with the empirical evidence on overoptimism and neglected crash risk, in these
models excessive credit booms are the product of behavioral biases—such as extrapolative
belief formation—and not due to incentive problems of rational agents. In this context,
higher capital will do little to moderate such overoptimism during the buildup of risks,
although it may still act as a buffer for losses once optimism wanes.
How then is capital structure related to banking crisis risk and severity? Ultimately this is

1

an empirical question, and we answer it by turning to 150 years of modern financial history
across 17 advanced economies. Our paper belongs to a growing literature in macrofinance
that relies on long-run and cross-country perspectives to produce new knowledge about
rare crisis events and the role of financial factors in the business cycle (Jordà, Schularick,
and Taylor, 2013; Krishnamurthy and Muir, 2016; Reinhart and Rogoff, 2009; Romer and
Romer, 2017; Schularick and Taylor, 2012).
The backbone of our study is a newly constructed aggregate data set for the advanced
economies over the 1870–2015 period which covers three core categories of the funding mix
of financial intermediaries: capital, deposits, and other (non-deposit) debt instruments. The
new panel data complement prior work on the asset side of banking systems, and bank
credit in particular (see Jordà et al., 2017). Looking ahead, we expect that the new data we
release here will become an important resource for future research, over and above their
contribution to this study.
We make three main contributions, corresponding to three parts of the paper. First, we
establish new stylized facts on the long-run evolution of the capital structure of banking
systems in advanced economies. Importantly, we correct the widely held view that capital
ratios decreased substantially in the decades preceding the 2007–08 crisis. On the contrary,
even unweighted (i.e., not risk-adjusted) capital ratios have remained remarkably stable
over the entire post-WW2 period. Capital-to-asset ratios fell from around 30% in the late
19th century to about 5%–10% in 1950 (see Figure 1 below). Since then they have remained
in a tight range across all the countries in our sample.
Such stability in capital ratios is quite striking compared to the “hockey stick pattern”
seen in many other financial variables in advanced economies, such as aggregate balance
sheets and mortgage lending (Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor, 2017). Instead, the most notable
long-run change in banks’ funding structures occurred in the composition of debt liabilities.
For example, in 1950, bank debt funding consisted almost entirely of deposits. The share
of non-deposit debt liabilities increased rapidly starting in the 1970s. On the eve of the
2007–08 crisis, the deposit share of debt funding had shrunk to 50% of total debt liabilities.
In short, the important development in the capital structure of banks was not a decline
in equity capital, but rather the banks’ increasing reliance on non-deposit and potentially
“runnable” debt funding.
In the second part of the paper, we study the relationship between the capital structure
of banks and systemic banking crises. We establish stylized correlations by comparing the
predictive ability of capital ratios, as a measure of “skin in the game”, to that of credit
expansions and the two liquidity measures: the loans-to-deposits ratio and the share of
non-deposit liabilities to debt. In line with the recent literature, we identify systemic

2

banking crises narratively as periods when significant parts of the banking system fail
or have to be rescued by government intervention (Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor, 2017;
Laeven and Valencia, 2012; Schularick and Taylor, 2012). Our results are robust to other
chronologies, as we will show.
We find scant evidence that bank capital ratios are predictive of systemic banking
crises ex ante. This is true whether we focus on the long-term variation in the levels of
capital ratios, or whether we focus on short-term variation by looking at 5-year changes
in capitalization. Lower capital ratios do not predict elevated crisis probabilities in either
our full sample, or focusing on the post-WW2 period. This is true even after controlling
for a wide range of macroeconomic indicators as well as indicators of asset risk and the
equity market’s perception of bank riskiness. The substantial variation of capital in our data
allows us to show that, historically, banking systems have been overwhelmed by financial
crises even with the highest of capital buffers.
We also show that bank capital, when viewed as a proxy of the “skin in the game”
hypothesis, does not predict future bank stock returns. Instead, quantity-based measures—
credit expansions in particular—perform much better, in line with the results on overoptimism during the boom in Baron and Xiong (2017).
In the third and last part of the paper, we examine the shock absorbing role of bank
equity. We ask how bank capital affects the intensity of banking crises and their economic
costs ex post. Seminal contributions on banking distress in the Great Depression (Bernanke,
1983), the role of financial intermediary health in Japan’s 1990s downturn and the Great
Recession (Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor, 2013; Khwaja and Mian, 2008; Peek and Rosengren,
2000), and recent work in macro-finance (Adrian, Mönch, and Shin, 2014; Brunnermeier
and Sannikov, 2014; Geanakoplos, 2010; He and Krishnamurthy, 2013; Kiyotaki and Moore,
1997; Muir, 2017) all emphasize that financial intermediary balance sheets and leverage
drive macroeconomic dynamics and asset prices. If intermediary health plays such an
important role for economic outcomes, it is natural to suspect that equity capital likely
affects post-crisis economic outcomes.
This is precisely what we find: bank capital limits the economic fallout of financial crises.
A more weakly capitalized financial sector going into the crisis is associated with a deeper
recession and a slower recovery. The differences in social costs are economically sizable.
We also find that in better capitalized banking systems, credit grows much faster in the
recovery, a potential channel that might explain this difference in outcomes.
Overall, the central finding is that our current regulatory system is built on an indicator
that is unrelated to the incidence of systemic banking crises across modern economic history.
Our results on the predictability of crises and returns do not prove, but are consistent with

3

the view that the causes of financial crises are rooted in collective failures to understand
and adequately price risks. In this view, crises occur when overly exuberant expectations
are adjusted and the prices of leveraged assets fall rapidly, thus putting lenders’ solvency
in doubt (Baron and Xiong, 2017; Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer, 2018; Krishnamurthy
and Muir, 2016).1 This view also implies that capital requirements have little bite during
the buildup of risks in a boom.
Once the crisis materializes, capital buffers play a role in limiting damage to the economy;
but substantial losses are baked in, and this is only partial mitigation. The case for bank
capital regulation is intact. At the same time, these findings caution against being lulled
into a false sense of security by rising capital ratios. Higher capital ratios are no shortcut to
evaluate and achieve financial stability. Instead, reducing crisis risk may depend on quite
different actions, e.g. targeting credit growth and maturity mismatch more directly.2

2.

New data

The new dataset introduced here includes balance sheet liabilities of financial institutions on
an annual basis from 1870 to 2015 for 17 advanced economies. Moreover, we disaggregate
bank liabilities into capital, deposits, and other (non-core) liabilities. Schularick and Taylor
(2012), and the updates in Jordà et al. (2017), focused on the asset side of bank balance
sheets (and on macroeconomic aggregates). The new data cover the liability side of the
bank balance sheets, thus completing the picture.
Table 1 describes the coverage of the new data. Except for a few countries, we were
able to locate data for the entire period. The data come from a variety of sources, such as
journal articles, central bank publications, historical yearbooks from statistical offices, as
well as archived annual reports from individual banks. In most cases there is no source
that covers the entire sample period and hence we had to link various sources to construct
a continuous time series.
We take book values from banking sector balance sheets and we aggregate the capital
structure into three broad categories: capital, deposits, and other debt liabilities. Table 2
displays, in simplified form, the typical structure of aggregate banking-sector balance sheets,
displaying data for 1929 and 2007 for the United States as an example. The table already
reveals a big change in the funding mix of banks over time, as we will show: non-core
liabilities have become a much more important source of funding, rising here from under
1 Baron

and Xiong (2017) show that higher crash risk of bank equity during a credit boom is not adequately
priced. Krishnamurthy and Muir (2016) find that credit spreads are too low prior to financial crises. Bordalo
et al. (2018) show that these empirical findings are consistent with extrapolative expectations, where agents
over-weigh incoming information when building expectations about the future.
2 A similar concern has recently been voiced by Sarin and Summers (2016).

one-tenth to almost one-third of liabilities even as capital has remained largely unchanged.

2.1.

Capital

Bank capital corresponds to the Basel III definition of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, i.e.,
shareholders’ funds that allow banks to absorb losses on an ongoing basis. These are
normally common stock (paid-up capital), reserves, and retained earnings.3 Dividing the
resulting measure of capital by total assets yields an unweighted capital ratio akin to the
“leverage ratio” in Basel III (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, 2014). Our definition
of total assets differs from the definition of total exposure used in the Basel III framework
as we observe only balance sheet data on total assets without being able to adjust assets for
3 As

defined in Basel III (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, 2011, paragraph 52), Common Equity
Tier 1 capital consists of the sum of the following elements: (1) common shares issued by the bank that meet
the criteria for classification as common shares for regulatory purposes (or the equivalent for non-joint stock
companies); (2) stock surplus (share premium) resulting from the issue of instruments included in Common
Equity Tier 1; (3) retained earnings; and (4) accumulated other comprehensive income and other disclosed
reserves. Additionally, the Basel definition includes “common shares issued by consolidated subsidiaries of
the bank and held by third parties (i.e., minority interest) that meet the criteria for inclusion in Common
Equity Tier 1 capital” and “regulatory adjustments applied in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1.”

off-balance sheet exposures.4
Paid-up capital, retained earnings, and reserves have been reported in almost all cases
throughout the entire period. We chose this specific definition of a capital ratio, as other
measures based on risk-weighted assets are often prone to changes in the underlying
assessment of risk attributed to certain asset classes and suffer from various problems
discussed in Admati et al. (2013). Furthermore, in contrast to capital measures based on
current market values, such as market capitalization, our book value measure is not affected
by short-term fluctuations in asset prices. We will, however, verify our results later with
market measures of bank capital as a robustness check.

2.2.

Deposits and debt instruments

We include in deposits both term and sight deposits, and both checking and savings accounts
by residents. Whenever possible we exclude interbank deposits and deposits by foreigners,
as we aim to calculate total domestic deposits by non-financial resident entities. Yet in some
instances this was not possible as different types of deposits were not reported separately.
Interbank deposits as well as wholesale funding through interbank loans are included in
the third category, other liabilities. Balance sheet items picked up by this category have
changed over the course of time, but they mainly consist of bonds, repos, and interbank

Committee on Banking Supervision (2011) outlines how to adjust total assets in order to arrive at
the total exposure measure.

loans. By convention, we will also refer to other liabilities as non-core liabilities.

2.3.

Balance sheet ratios

Several key balance-sheet ratios of financial intermediaries are central to the analysis,
starting with the capital ratio defined like today’s Basel III “leverage ratio,” that is, the ratio
of capital over total assets given by
Capital ratio =

Capital
.
Total assets

(1)

Next we compute the ratio of loans to deposits, which is often considered a measure of
banking sector illiquidity or vulnerability (Cecchetti, King, and Yetman, 2011). This ratio is
defined as
LtD ratio =

Loans
.
Deposits

(2)

Finally, we compute the share of other liabilities in total debt liabilities (excluding capital).
In order to avoid confusion, we will refer to this measure as the non-core ratio, defined as
Non-core ratio =

Other liabilities
.
Deposits + Other liabilities

(3)

The non-core ratio has taken on renewed significance since 2007. Recent studies have
argued that large inflows of non-core funds can destabilize the banking system (Hahm,
Shin, and Shin, 2013).

3.

Key trends

In most countries, capital ratios decreased substantially from 1870 up to WW2 and have
remained relatively stable thereafter. Loan-to-deposit ratios show a pronounced V-shape
over the full sample period, with the lowest values during WW2 and, conversely, high levels
at the beginning and the end of the full sample period. Non-core liabilities increasingly
replaced deposits in the last quarter of the 20th century and remained at high levels until
the 2007 crisis. We provide further details on these trends below.

3.1.

Capital ratio

Bank leverage rose dramatically from 1870 until the mid-20th century, as shown in Figure 1.
The cross-country average aggregate capital ratio decreased steadily from around 30% to
less than 10% right after WW2, before fluctuating in the range 5%–10% over subsequent

decades up to the present. A similar picture emerges at the country level as we show in
Figures A.1 and A.2 in the Online Appendix. This is consistent with the work of Saunders
and Wilson (1999), who studied the decline of capital ratios in Canada, the US, and the UK.
It also dovetails with Grossman (2010), who documented a decreasing capital ratio between
1840 and 1940 for a subsample of our countries; it also mirrors developments discussed by
banking historians for many smaller sub-periods at the individual country level. Our new
data show that similar patterns hold across a broader set of advanced economies.
Since scaling issues can make it difficult to track developments after 1945, we separately
present these trends in Figure A.2. In the years preceding the financial crisis, capital ratios
increased slightly in some countries although they are generally stable over this sample.
Table 3, shows for each country in our sample the year with the lowest capital ratio until
the year before the recent crisis. These dates are spread out over the 60 years between the
end of WW2 and the financial crisis of 2007–08.

3.2.

Debt structure

In Figure 2 we plot the share of capital, deposits, and non-core liabilities. While deposits
make up the largest share of funding at all times, the patterns change substantially over
time. Until about 1950, the share of deposits in total funding increased as the capital ratio
decreased. There was little change in the share of non-core liabilities. Deposits made up

80% of all liabilities in the immediate post-WW2 period.
By the early 2000s, the share of deposits had fallen to around 50%. This illustrates
the increasing importance in recent decades of non-core (e.g., wholesale) funding sources,
which is central to the growing separation of money and credit in the post-WW2 period
discussed by Schularick and Taylor (2012) as well as Jordà et al. (2013). The debt funding
mix between non-core liabilities and deposits changed from being almost exclusively
deposit-based in 1950 to a high non-core share in the early 2000s. Figure A.3 shows the
evolution of the non-core funding share for each country in the post-WW2 period. It is
striking that a rising trend is seen in virtually all countries. It is also evident that the
non-core ratio typically declines after financial crises, as in the Scandinavian crises of the
late 1980s and early 1990s, and after the global financial crisis of 2007–08.

3.3.

Liquidity

Banks intermediate funds between borrowers and savers. This intermediation model entails
a maturity transformation since banks borrow short and lend long. In our data on balance
sheets, this mechanism is reflected by deposits, callable on short notice on the liability
side; and loans, with longer maturities, on the asset side. The LtD ratio is a common
metric of bank illiquidity since a higher level means that banks would typically find it more
difficult to withstand large deposit outflows. Table 1 in Cecchetti et al. (2011) shows large
heterogeneity in this ratio across banking systems in the world today.
Figure 3 shows the mean LtD ratio for all 17 countries in the full sample. There is a
V-shape pattern, with a low near 50% at the end of WW2 when banks held a large share of
their assets in government securities, a side-effect of war-time government finance policies
rather than a market outcome. Hand in hand with the increase of deposits as a source of

funds, the average LtD ratio declined from above 100% in 1870 until 1945. It then increased,
from 75% in the 1950s to more than 100% before the global financial crisis. After the crisis,
the LtD ratio has decreased as banks have deleveraged and reduced non-core funding.
Figure A.4 shows long-term LtD ratios at the country level. The trends appear very similar
again. In most countries, the LtD ratio reaches a trough in WW2 and rises thereafter.

Bank capital structure around financial crises

We conclude our exposition of key trends by describing the dynamics of banking sector
balance sheet ratios around financial crises. Crises are identified narratively as periods
when significant parts of the banking system fail or have to be rescued by government
intervention (Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor, 2017; Laeven and Valencia, 2012; Schularick and
Taylor, 2012). The exact crisis dates are listed in the Online Appendix.
Consider the first two panels in Figure 4, which examine the LtD and capital ratios
around financial crises. These ratios are shown relative to their value in the year of the crisis,
year 0, which is normalized to 1. The solid blue line corresponds to the median of the corresponding ratio across all financial crises, and the grey area marks the interquartile range.
We also split the data into a high- and a low-bank capital regimes. The dashed/dotted
green/red lines plot the behavior of the median for financial crises when the lagged level
of the capital ratio was above/below the median.
The left panel of Figure 4 shows that the LtD ratio increases prior to financial crises

and decreases afterwards. The patterns are less clear for the equity capital ratio, shown in
the second panel of Figure 4. Before a financial crisis, book capital ratios do not change
meaningfully. This is true at both high (dashed, green) and low (dotted, red) levels of
capitalization. However, following a financial crisis the trajectory of capital ratios differs
substantially depending on the initial level of capitalization. When capital is relatively
low before the crisis, banks will tend to increase capital following the crisis. One possible
explanation is that creditors probably penalize banks with low levels of capital. Moreover,
changes in the regulatory environment following the crisis likely target banks whose capital
buffers were deemed inadequate. When capital buffers are initially on the high side, they
provide loss absorption capacity for banks following the crisis. As a result equity falls.
Another way to look at the data from the first two panels in Figure 4 is provided in
Figure 5. These bin-scatter plots show that large credit expansions, often before a crisis,
are typically financed with a surge in non-deposit funding (the upward sloping cloud of
points). These non-deposit funds then dry up after the crisis, at a time when credit growth
is low or negative. In contrast, capital ratios remain stable (the flat cloud of points) during
credit expansions, so that loss-absorption capacity does not appear to buildup concurrently,
matching the patterns we described in Figure 4.
These two pieces of evidence speak of a weak connection between bank capital and crisis
risk, a finding that is further corroborated in Figure 6. The graph shows the frequency of
banking crises in five equal-sized bins, where observations are sorted into the bins according
to 5-year averages of changes in capital ratios. Banking crisis risks appear unrelated to

capital ratio changes since the frequency of crises is almost the same in the lowest and
highest bins of average 5-year capital ratio changes.5
Turning from asset and liability composition to the growth of balance sheets, the third
panel of Figure 4 presents the well-known result that crises are preceded by a credit
boom, which is clearly visible in the event windows. This pattern does not depend on
the capitalization of the banking sector, the red dotted and the green dashed lines are
essentially on top of each other. However, capitalization seems to play a role in the aftermath
of financial crises, a pattern we explore in more detail later.
Finally, the fourth panel of Figure 4 shows cumulative log excess returns of bank
shareholders relative to year 0. Returns are high during the boom, but shareholders make
significant losses in the year of the crisis, mirroring the pattern reported in Baron and Xiong
(2017). Even when bank capital ratios are above the median (the green dashed line), returns
do increase prior to systemic banking crises, only for shareholders to be systematically
disappointed in the following years. As argued by Baron and Xiong (2017) bank equity
rallies during credit booms and before crisis events suggest that bank shareholders are not
aware of the impending crisis. The right panel in Figure 4 suggests that bank equity prices
do not seem to reflect risks more accurately when bank capital is above the median.

Capital structure and crisis risk

How is capital structure related to bank risk-taking and the likelihood of financial crises?
The previous section provided some suggestive evidence that we explore more formally
in this section. Before that, it is useful to review what competing theories tell us about
the role of capital. An influential view argues that “more skin in the game” would reduce
bankers’ risk-taking incentives. Bankers have an incentive to take risks since the payouts
from their bets are asymmetric (Merton, 1977). Thus, more skin in the game could lead
to more prudent behavior, improve screening and monitoring incentives for banks, and
thereby reduce the probability that financial institutions face large and life-threatening
losses (Holmstrom and Tirole, 1997; Mehran and Thakor, 2011). Incentives to engage in risk
shifting or asset substitution arise because of limited liability (Jensen and Meckling, 1976)
or to exploit mispriced deposit insurance (Merton, 1977). In this view, higher capital ratios
serve as a remedy for agency frictions at the heart of financial crisis dynamics.6
Another view puts overoptimism and neglect of tail risk at the center of the credit
boom–crisis nexus. In recent credit cycle models (Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer, 2018;
Greenwood, Hanson, and Jin, 2018) positive news during good times are extrapolated into
the future and create overoptimism. Non-rational expectations of market participants allow
financial crisis risks to remain largely unnoticed, until beliefs are suddenly corrected during
a predictable reversal. In this view, bank capital is orthogonal to the buildup of crisis risks
and only plays a buffer role once the reversal occurs.
In sum, theory offers no clear guidance whether higher capital is associated with lower
crisis risk, and better empirical evidence is needed. Some studies have used contemporary
data to study the performance of a leverage ratio as a crisis predictor and found no clear
evidence.7 Our long-run dataset on the liability composition of the banking sector allows us
to study the relationship between capital, risk-taking, and crises systematically, exploiting
6 Empirically,

some studies report evidence consistent with the risk-shifting hypothesis (e.g., Esty, 1997;
Gan, 2004; Landier et al., 2011) while others have found little empirical support (e.g., Gropp et al., 2011 for
banks and Gilje, 2016 for non-financial firms). The disciplining role of equity capital has also been challenged
theoretically. One strand of the literature argues that leverage can be beneficial because uninsured short-term
creditors monitor and discipline bankers more effectively (Calomiris and Kahn, 1991; Diamond and Rajan,
2001) than equity holders. Other studies argue that imposing higher capital requirements may perversely
increase bank risk (Blum, 1999; Gale, 2010; Kim and Santomero, 1988; Rochet, 1992). This will be especially the
case, when banks have to meet profitability targets. Adrian et al. (2015) show that return-on-equity targeting
is indeed a widespread industry practice. Berger and Bouwman (2013) present emprical evidence that capital
protects especially small banks individually against default, but Jiménez et al. (2017) find evidence that higher
regulatory capital buffers even increased risk-taking among Spanish banks during the boom in the early
2000’s.
7 Cihak and Schaeck (2010) and Detken et al. (2014) find no relationship between capital ratios and crisis
risks, while Behn et al. (2013) find a link between low capitalization and crisis risks. Barth et al. (2006) find no
relationship between bank capital regulation and crisis risks.

14

the within country variation in capital ratios over time.
We now turn to a formal econometric model to investigate financial crises and the
predictive ability of our three key balance sheet measures, namely the capital ratio, the
LtD ratio, and the non-core ratio. We will estimate probit regressions and assume, as is
standard in the literature, that the probability of a crisis conditional on observables Xi,t can
be represented in terms of the normal cumulative distribution function,
Pr [Si,t = 1 | αi , Xi,t ] = Φ(αi + βXi,t ) ,

(4)

for all years t and countries i in the sample, where Si,t is an indicator variable for the start
of a systemic financial crisis.
The vector Xi,t includes the average annual change of the ratio of credit to GDP over
the previous 5-year window (denoted ∆5 Loans/GDP), following Schularick and Taylor
(2012). We then evaluate the additional predictive power coming from the lagged level of
each of the three balance-sheet ratios and 5-year average annual changes in capital ratios,
one at a time. The coefficients reported in all the tables correspond to the marginal effect
of the covariate evaluated at its sample mean. To soak up cross-country heterogeneity, we
include a country fixed effect, αi . We exclude 5-year windows after the two world wars to
avoid measuring the effects of wartime financing on banks’ balance sheets. Pooled models
and a variety of other robustness checks are reported in the Online Appendix.
To evaluate crisis predictive ability, we focus on the AUC statistic, the area under the
ROC curve. This standard classification statistic measures the ability of a model to correctly
sort the data into crisis and no-crisis bins. The AUC uses the variation of true and false
positive rates as a function of the entire range of probability cutoffs. The AUC is close to
0.5 for models that have little ability to sort observations correctly, and it approaches 1 for
models that perfectly sort the data.
The central question we address is whether capital ratios improve crisis prediction. We
use as a benchmark null a model that only includes country-fixed effects. This benchmark
has an AUC = 0.61 in the full sample, and an AUC = 0.60 in the post-WW2 sample. Since
some countries are more prone to financial crises than others, fixed-effects already have the
ability to sort the data somewhat. We use this as our benchmark null that observables add
no additional information rather than the more customary 0.5 level.
Table 4 shows the full and post-WW2 sample results for the specifications with covariates.
As in Schularick and Taylor (2012), the credit variable is positively related to a higher
probability of a crisis in all specifications. The model with 5-year annual average changes
in credit/GDP as a single predictor variable (not reported) has an AUC = 0.71 in the full
sample, and an AUC = 0.74 in the post-WW2 sample, statistically different from the fixed

effect null model (with AUC = 0.61 or 0.60). In column (1), for example, the coefficient of
0.82 means that a 2 percentage point increase (about 1 standard deviation) in the average
annual change in the loans to GDP ratio would increase the probability of a crisis by 1.6
percentage points, all else equal. Note that crises happen about 5% of the time in the full
sample, so this is a considerable boost in crisis risk.
We see that models that include the unweighted capital ratio typically have the “wrong”
sign. Higher capital is associated with higher crisis risk. The effects are economically small.
A 2 percentage point boost to capital (an oft discussed figure for countercyclical buffers)
is associated with a 0.34 percentage points higher crisis probability in the full sample, for
the specification in column (1). The coefficient on the loan-to-deposits ratio in column (5)
is more intuitive and statistically significant though economically small. A 10 percentage
point increase in this ratio (about 1 standard deviation) boosts crisis risk by 0.4 percentage
points. Lastly, the model based on the non-core ratio and displayed in column (7) has an
AUC = 0.71, almost equivalent to the credit-only null model in the full sample.
The post-WW2 results have a similar flavor but with a few notable differences. The levels
and changes of the capital ratio now both have a positive coefficient and add no meaningful
predictive value. The coefficient on the loan-to-deposits ratio is highly significant and yields
some improvement in predictive ability: AUC rises from 0.74 in the credit-only model, to
16

0.80 using the LtD ratio in column (6). For the post-WW2 sample, the non-core ratio also
enters significantly, with the expected sign (more non-traditional funding predicts crisis
risk), and with further improvement in predictive ability, as the AUC increases to 0.84 in
column (8). These results reiterate that, in the post-WW2 era, it was credit expansion and
the debt funding structure of banks, not capital ratios, that best predicted crisis risk.

4.1.

Additional controls, market-based capital, and subsamples

Why is there no visible association between bank capital and crisis risk? One explanation
may be that the markets force banks to adjust capital endogenously if the riskiness of assets
changes. Variations in the simple capital ratio might then not properly proxy for changes
in the underlying risk-adjusted capital ratio. Controlling for asset and macroeconomic risks
will thus be an important task, but not the only one. We also study the capital-crisis nexus
replacing the book value of capital with a market-based measure and explore the stability
of our core results across a variety of additional specifications described briefly here and in
more detail in the Online Appendix.
However, all these checks reinforce the central message from Table 4: there is very
little evidence linking capital, as a measure of skin in the game, and subsequent crises.
This is a statement about the absence of predictive ability of the capital ratio, but it has
interesting implications on its own. It means that our current system of global banking
regulation is based on a variable that is not correlated with the outcomes that we care the
most about—namely, reducing the incidence of financial crises.

4.2.

Controlling for asset risk

Table 5 includes controls for macroeconomic risks, asset prices, and the market’s perception
of the riskiness of banks’ balance sheets. For the latter we use the bank equity risk premiums
constructed by Baron and Xiong (2017).8 In addition to risk premiums, we control for house
price booms, proxied by 5-year average changes in real house prices, and the volatility of
house price growth over the preceding 5-year window. Interest rate or inflation volatility, as
well as other macroeconomic risks could also affect the riskiness of banks’ balance sheets
and are therefore included.
We first add macroeconomic controls to the respective baseline model using long- and
short-run variation in capital ratios in the full and post-WW2 sample in Table 5, in the
odd-numbered columns. As for the asset price controls, the house price variables and bank

data on bank index excess returns is not available, we use excess returns on the broad stock market

equity risk premiums are only available for a subset of observations, so these regressors are
added subsequently, in the even-numbered columns.
Summing up, all specifications in this table result in marginal effects nearly identical to
those reported in Table 4. The coefficient on bank capital always enters with the “wrong”
sign: more capital predicts a higher, not lower risk of crisis.

4.3.

Other robustness checks

The Online Appendix presents a large battery of additional robustness tests, briefly described here.
Clustering In Table A.6 and Table A.7 we repeat our two main specifications additionally
clustering standard errors on the year dimension to deal with possible cross-sectional
correlation, but the results remain unchanged.
Deposit insurance Deposit insurance could affect the link between capital and crisis risk.
Hence, we explore the stability of our results, and in Table A.8 we estimate our baseline
specification separately for country-year observations with and without a deposit insurance
scheme in place.
18

Market value of capital Haldane (2011) argues for using market-based capitalization
indicators in addition to accounting data. Using data from Datastream, we included
market-based capital ratios. Table A.9 shows that results do not materially change.
Heterogeneity within banking systems Aggregate capital ratios could mask substantial
heterogeneity within banking systems. Risks could be concentrated in a few, systemically
important institutions or in a subset of banks with very low capital ratios. We employ
more granular data in Table A.10 and Table A.11. In both cases, capital ratios remain poor
predictors of crisis risks.
Booms split by level of capital If more skin in the game induces prudent behavior by
banks, we would expect to find in the data that credit booms at high levels of bank equity
are less likely to end in a crisis than credit booms financed with less equity. In Table A.12,
however, we find no difference between high and low capital booms.
Split samples by period In Tables A.13 and A.14 we present unconditional correlations
from probit specifications including only fixed effects in the full and post-WW2 samples.
Table A.15 shows that there is no systematic relationship between capital ratios and financial
crises in a pre-1914 sample with little or no bank regulation in many countries.9
Saturated model Table A.16 shows results where we start from a full model including
the change in credit-to-GDP, the capital ratio, and the non-core ratio. We then drop one
variable at a time. The resulting decline in predictive accuracy from dropping the capital
ratio is small relative to dropping the other variables. The capital ratio improves predictive
accuracy only when the coefficient has the “wrong” positive sign in the full sample.
Further subsamples and crisis chronologies We then exclude the 2007–08 financial crisis
(Table A.19), and repeat the analysis excluding the UK and the US (Table A.20) since these
two countries have historically the largest share of shadow banking activities. Additionally,
we test robustness to the inclusion of country-decade fixed effects into the probit specifications (Table A.22) to control for unobservable long-run changes across countries. Table A.23
employs a different crisis chronology that is based on crashes in the bank equity index
(Baron, Verner, and Xiong, 2020), but capital ratios are also unrelated to these crashes.
9 For

completeness, Tables A.17 and A.18 repeat the estimates of Tables A.13 and A.14, but without fixed
effects to account for the possibility that the fixed effects capture cross-country differences in capital ratios
and their effects on crisis risks.

19

IV estimate Many results here, and in the Online Appendix, show that higher capital is
weakly, but positively associated with higher crisis risk. As discussed above, one explanation
could be that bank capital is endogenously determined, and our controls for asset risk may
not entirely pick up the reality (or perception) that a bank with risky positions may hold or
be forced to hold more capital. How much could endogeneity bias still matter here?
Ideally, an instrumental variable would be needed to capture exogenous variation in
capital—a tall order. Given data availability, the best we can devise is past return on assets,
a common source of voluntary capital expansions (Appendix I.14). The first stage shows
this candidate IV is strong, but as always the exclusion restriction cannot be formally
evaluated. Assuming that, and controlling for credit growth and risk premiums, changes in
return on assets are otherwise unrelated to crisis risk, and it can serve as an instrument for
bank capital. Subject to these caveats, Table A.24 shows Conditional IV estimates. Here,
capital ratios are still not associated with crisis risk: the point estimate is negative, but is
economically (and statistically) very weak. This exercise goes to show that the purported
strong negative association between capital and crisis risk is hard to find in the data.
The results of all these tests confirm our findings: credit growth, the LtD ratio and the
non-core ratio are significant predictors of financial crisis, but the capital ratio exhibits a
“wrong”-signed, weak, or non-existent predictive relationship with crisis risk.

5.

Capital ratios and bank stock returns

A different approach to analyzing the role of bank capital is by examining its relation to
the returns on bank stocks. In recent work, Baron and Xiong (2017) show that loan growth
predicts lower subsequent returns to bank equity—there is little evidence that investors ask
for compensation for rising risks during credit booms. In line with behavioral theories of
credit cycles, the equity market does not appear to price the risks stemming from rapid
credit expansions. Does the capital ratio help predict stock returns going forward and
signal rising risks in the way that asset-side quantities do?
Predicted bank stock returns To test this, we ask whether balance sheet ratios are correlated with future returns on bank stocks. This is a useful check of whether capital ratios
contain valuable information for regulators. We follow Baron and Xiong (2017) and regress
bank index excess returns on bank balance sheet ratios using credit growth and equity
index dividends as controls using the following specification:

Notes: The dependent variable is the log excess return on the bank equity index from Baron and Xiong (2017) cumulated over h years,
where h is specified in the column header. All specifications include ∆3 Loans/GDP and bank equity index dividend yield as control
variables (with the exception of ∆3 Loans/GDP in the first three columns of Panel A these results are nor reported). All RHS variables
are standardized at the country level using past data to avoid look-ahead bias. All specifications include country fixed effects. Standard
errors in parentheses are computed using the Driscoll-Kraay method accounting for autocorrelation of up to 17 lags (the mean of results
using the automatic bandwidth selection in individual country time series regressions). *, **, *** indicate significance at the 0.1, 0.05,
0.01 level, respectively.

bank is the horizon-h cumulative log-return on bank equity, and r

sponding log-return using the safe rate.
Table 6 reports the estimates of this regression for each balance sheet variable of interest.
Note that we standardize all explanatory variables at the country level and use only past
observations to avoid any look-ahead bias. Table A.31 shows the results where controls are
omitted for completeness. The results are very similar.
Columns (1)–(3) in Panel A in Table 6 are the baseline results with only ∆3 Loans/GDP
and bank equity index dividend yield as regressors. Columns (1)–(3) confirm the core result
from Baron and Xiong (2017) showing that an increase in the credit-to-GDP ratio over a
three-year window is associated with lower bank equity returns going forward.
Next, Panel B looks at the additional explanatory power of the capital ratio measured
two ways: first, in levels (columns (1)–(3)); and, second, over a three-year period (columns

21

(4)–(6)). In both cases, higher capital ratios signal lower returns, but the standard errors are
large and the fit is almost the same as the baseline regression in panel A.
Finally, Panel C examines the two liquidity ratios we discussed earlier. We find that
increasing loan-to-deposit ratios (columns (1)–(3)) are somewhat informative and are
associated with lower returns to bank shareholders, but the effect is very mild (the effects
are larger in the univariate analysis reported in Table A.31 not surprisingly).
Unlike quantity measures of asset growth, and insofar as one can interpret the capital
ratio as a proxy for incentive-driven risk taking, we find that the capital ratio is not
associated with future banking sector risks. In sum, the evidence on return predictability is
also consistent with the view that risk-taking in credit booms is not closely linked to “skin
in the game” explanations based on capital.
Discussion The evidence presented above does not suggest that capital ratios play an
important role in signaling imminent crisis risk or future declines in bank stock returns.
Rather, the evidence suggests that the disciplining effects of bank capital are absent when
they presumably matter most: during credit booms (Jiménez et al., 2017). This finding is
consistent with work that points to the overoptimism of insiders and market-wide neglect
of crash risk during credit booms (Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer, 2018; Kindleberger,
1978; Minsky, 1986; Shiller, 2000).
Capital ratios typically do not change much during the credit boom run-up to banking
crises. Moreover, the market value of equity capital is endogenous and often surges
during the boom. He and Krishnamurthy (2013) therefore argue that intermediary leverage
is counter-cyclical. From a historical perspective, given our new data, this seems quite
plausible.
However, liquidity matters. Rising loan-to-deposit ratios and non-deposit funding
presage banking crises. Growing maturity mismatch and exposure to uninsured short-term
debt pose a measurable threat to financial stability, in line with the seminal insights offered
by Diamond and Dybvig (1983).

Bank capital and the severity of financial crisis recessions

Although modern financial history provides little evidence that higher levels of bank capital
are associated with safer financial systems, could they facilitate the recovery from a crisis?
This is the question we investigate in this section. Higher capital ratios are indeed associated
with milder recessions and swifter recoveries from financial crises. This finding echoes
recent empirical work by Cecchetti et al. (2011) and Berkmen et al. (2012) on the 2007–08
financial crisis and adds nuance to the characterization of financial crisis recoveries reported

by Jordà et al. (2013). The results are consistent with recent models of macroeconomic
amplification through the balance sheets of levered financial intermediaries (e.g., Adrian
and Boyarchenko, 2012). Furthermore, they add an aggregate dimension to empirical results
on the real effects of shocks to financial intermediaries (e.g., Jiménez et al., 2017; Khwaja
and Mian, 2008; Peek and Rosengren, 2000). These results also show that the variation
in leverage ratios that we measure do capture fluctuations in the risk exposure of banks,
linking the first and the second part of the paper.
The experiments that we conduct are straightforward. We take bank capital at its
pre-treatment level. Crises, by virtue of being largely unpredictable with respect to capital,
act as a quasi-random assignment mechanism that permits us a direct comparison of their
aftermath for different levels of capital. We use local projections to conduct this type of
experiment (Jordà, 2005) to allow for appropriate control.
In particular, we focus on recession episodes and split these into financial recessions
(recessions associated with a financial crisis in a ±2 year window), and normal recessions
(all others), as in Jordà et al. (2013). We further split financial recessions into two bins
depending on whether the one-period lagged capital ratio of the banking sector at the onset
of the recession is above or below the historical average.
The dependent variable is defined as the difference in 100 times the log of real GDP per
capita from the year when the recession starts t( p), to h years later t( p) + h, and written as

23

∆h yi,t( p) . The notation t( p) refers to the calendar time period t where the business cycle
peak p takes place. We use the Bry and Boschan (1971) algorithm to determine t( p). At
yearly frequency, this algorithm exactly matches the NBER peak dating for the US. The
definition of the dependent variable can be interpreted as the cumulative growth of real
GDP per capita between the business cycle peak and h years later. The specification includes
country fixed effects.
We define an indicator variable, di,t( p) , which is used to distinguish normal from financial
crisis recessions and is therefore 1 if the recession is a financial recession and zero otherwise.
We define an indicator variable, δi,t( p) , that is one if the one-period lagged capital ratio of
the banking sector in country i at the start of the financial recession t( p) is higher than the
mean of one-period lagged capital ratios over all financial recessions.
We also consider a vector of control variables, Xi,t( p) , which include: the value at peak
and the first lag of the growth rates of real GDP per capita, real investment per capita, CPI
inflation, short and long term interest rates, and the current account to GDP ratio. Thus,
the specification of the local projections is:
∆h yi,t( p) =

I −1

∑ αi,h Di,t( p) + µh + γhH I di,t( p) × δi,t( p) + γhLO di,t( p) × (1 − δi,t( p) )

i =1

+ ΦXi,t( p) + ei,t( p) ,

(6)

for h = 1, ..., 5. The coefficients γhH I (above-average capital) and γhLO (below-average capital),
modulate how the economy behaves after a financial crisis recession as a function of the
level of the bank capital ratio at the start of the recession, as explained. With this setup,
the average path of output per capita after a financial recession with a below- (or, above-)
average capitalized banking sector is given by µh + γhLO (or, µh + γhH I ), which can then be
compared to µh for a normal recession. We will also be interested in characterizing the
average path of the economy after a normal recession, that is, µh .
The estimates of this augmented model appear in Table 7. The coefficients for the two
crisis recession bins separated by the level of banking sector capitalization are statistically
not distinguishable in years 1 and 2, but capitalization begins to matter from year 3 onwards.
The paths are shown in the right panel of Figure 7. The average effect after a financial
recession with an above- (or, below-) average capitalized banking sector is given by µh + γhLO
(or, µh + γhH I ), compared to µh for a normal recession. These outcomes are shown by the
green dashed, red dotted, and blue solid lines, respectively. The grey area is the 90%
confidence region for the normal recession path. As a reference, we provide local projection
estimates without controls on the lefthand side panel. These estimates are reported in
Table A.25. The similarities between the two panels are clear. Indeed, the path differences

seem, if anything, even starker after controls are added.
Financial recessions are worse than normal recessions regardless of the bank capital
ratio. However, while an economy with a well capitalized banking sector (green dashed
line) recovers after year 2, and thereafter grows at a speed similar to that of a normal
recession, an economy with poorly capitalized banking sector (red dotted line) sees a more
protracted slump and recovers more slowly. Figure A.9 in the Online Appendix shows very
similar patterns when we sort financial crisis recessions into four quartiles according to
lagged capital ratios.

6.1.

Capital ratios as a continuous treatment

So far we have split financial recessions into two bins according to the capitalization of
the banking sector. We will now pursue a more ambitious specification to exploit the
information in our measure of bank capital ratios. Instead of splitting the sample at the
mean, we can now use a continuous measure of bank capital. In doing so, we will include
the interaction of the type of recession di,t( p) with the lagged level of the capital ratio wi,t( p)
at the respective peak, demeaned at the country i and bin (F, N) level, that is, (wi,t( p) − wi,N )
and (wi,t( p) − wi,F ), where wi,N refers to the mean capital ratio in country i in normal
recessions and wi,F to the mean in financial recessions.
We compare the economic outcomes within a given country and type of recession, based
on the capital ratio. We also include the six control variables from our baseline control
25

specification above. We then estimate the following set of local projections
∆h yi,t( p) =

I −1

∑ αi,h Di,t( p) + µh + γh di,t( p) + β hN (1 − di,t( p) )(wi,t( p) − wi,N )

i =1

+ β Fh di,t( p) (wi,t( p) − wi,F ) + ΦXi,t( p) + ei,t( p) ,

(7)

for h = 1, ..., 5. Here, µh is the average path after a recession peak, µh + γh is the average
path after a financial peak, and β Fh and β hN are the marginal effects of the capital ratio at the
begin of the recession. Again, all control variables are demeaned within each bin.
The results are presented in Table 8. The coefficient in the first row is the average
path of real GDP per capita for a normal recession, and in the second row is the average
difference from that path for a financial crisis recession. As we have seen before, financial
recessions are deeper and more protracted. Furthermore, we also see in the fourth row
that the interaction of the capital ratio with financial recessions has a significantly positive
effect on the path of real GDP per capita: a higher capital ratio is associated with a higher
path of real GDP per capita after the crisis. That is, financial recessions are less severe in
their output costs after the crisis, the higher is the capital ratio of the banking sector at the
onset. We see that the capitalization of the banking sector seems to matter even more the
longer the horizon we analyze. Putting numbers to these impacts, a bank capital ratio 10
percentage points higher than the country-specific mean at the start of financial recessions
is associated with a cumulative real GDP per capita that is higher in year 5 by 3.1% (and
cumulatively higher by 8.6% over 5 years).
In contrast to this finding, bank capital ratios do not seem to matter for the recovery
path after normal recessions as shown by the insignificant coefficient in the third row. We
present p-values for two tests: First, we see that the coefficients for the average coefficients
of financial and normal recessions differ significantly after year 2. Furthermore, we present
the p-value of a test for equality of the coefficients of the capital ratio in normal and
financial recessions. We see that the hypothesis of these two coefficients being equal is
rejected for the cumulative effect in years 4 and 5. This distinction is consistent with models
of amplification by leverage in which an initial shock to the banking sector propagates
through highly leveraged banks.

6.2.

Accounting for long-run changes in capital ratios

Could our results be biased by the inclusion in our sample of the recent financial crisis and
its aftermath? We saw that banking sectors had significantly higher leverage in the postWW2 period and economic recovery after the recent crisis is slow relative to other recessions.

cumulative change in real GDP per capita from the peak. Financial recession refers to the average path after financial recessions relative
to normal recessions. Interaction terms refer to marginal effects of capital ratios after normal and financial recessions relative to the
historical mean. Capital ratios have been multiplied by 100. See text.

A simple way to rule out that our results are driven only by the global financial crisis is
to exclude those observations. The sample then falls to N = 193 recession observations
(Table A.28). However, the findings are unchanged and a higher capital ratio at the onset of
a financial recession is still associated with a faster economic recovery.
It is also possible that the speed of economic recovery after recessions changed over
our long-run sample. In Table 9 we add more fixed effects to account for decade specific
variations in the speed of economic recovery.10 The results, displayed in Table 9 are
reassuring. A high capital ratio predicts a speedier recovery from a financial crisis recession,
with the average path being close to the path in normal recessions. Low capital ratios are
associated with slower recovery and lower output several years after the crisis.
Both approaches, excluding the recent crisis and including decade fixed effects, are
depicted in Figure 8. The left panel shows average path estimates when we exclude the
recent crisis from our data. The right panel shows the estimates when we include decadal

path, decade fixed effects add up to one and we omit the first decade of the twenty-first century.

fixed effects. In both cases, it is easy to see that economic recovery takes longer if the
banking sector had less loss absorption capacity at the beginning of a financial crisis
recession.

6.3.

Inspecting the mechanism: the credit channel

Previous sections have shown that pre-recession capital ratios and economic recovery
following the crisis are strongly related. It could be that highly levered intermediaries
cannot extend credit after an initial shock to their balance sheets in line with recent research
(Chodorow-Reich, 2014; Khwaja and Mian, 2008; Peek and Rosengren, 2000).
We test this proposition by estimating local projections with cumulative changes in
real private credit per capita as the dependent variable, and by allowing for differences in
capital ratios before the financial peak. We use real private credit instead of normalizing
credit by GDP to avoid measuring the relationship of bank capital with GDP examined in
previous subsections. Hence, ∆h yi,t( p) now refers to the cumulative change in real private
credit per capita extended by financial intermediaries.
In Figure 9 we show results of this specification (estimates are reported in Table A.29
and Table A.30). We compare the path of real private credit per capita after normal and
financial peaks and bin financial recessions by capital ratios. As in previous exercises, the

solid blue line refers to the path after normal recessions, while the dotted red and dashed
green lines reflect financial recessions when banks were above (dashed) and below (dotted)
the mean capital ratio of all such recessions.
We see first that, after a peak, credit growth in a typical financial crisis recession is on
average lower than in a normal recession. Furthermore, capital matters. Similar to the
dynamics of output, below-average capitalized banking systems extend much less credit
for several years in a financial crisis recession. These results therefore complement recent
micro-evidence on the role of capital for lending (Carlson, Shan, and Warusawitharana,
2013; Gambacorta and Marques-Ibanez, 2011; Jiménez, Ongena, Peydró, and Saurina, 2017;
Peek and Rosengren, 2000) and they are consistent with the idea that impairments to credit
creation could be an important vector from low bank capital ratios to the slow pace of
post-crisis economic recovery.

Conclusions

We present several hitherto unknown trends and stylized facts on the financial structure
of banking systems by introducing a new dataset covering the composition of banking
sector liabilities from 1870 to 2015 for a sample of 17 advanced economies. In most
countries, banking sector capital ratios declined rapidly before WW2, but have remained
low and stable since; yet other funding measures associated with banking fragility, like
loan-to-deposit ratios and non-core ratios, have risen markedly.
Over this long time span, our first main finding is that, perhaps counterintuitively,
there is no association between capital ratios and the likelihood of a systemic financial
crisis. This non-finding is robust to subsample changes, to adding macroeconomic and risk
controls and to replacing book capital with market valuations. Capital might protect banks
individually against idiosyncratic shocks, but not collectively against systemic events.
However, we do find that loan-to-deposit ratios are a strong predictor of vulnerability,
as some theories predict. And non-core liabilities have emerged in recent decades as a
risk factor in a departure from the preceding century of modern finance. All that said, the
evidence shows that the best crisis predictor for macroprudential regulators to monitor is
still aggregate credit growth. This conclusion is supported by return predictability exercises
that confirm a more important role for quantity-based measures as compared to balance
sheet ratios.
Nonetheless our second main finding suggests that, even if capital ratios are not
predictive of crisis incidence, well capitalized banking systems allow the economy to recover
faster following a financial crisis and thus result in significantly shallower recessions. One

30

reason appears to be that the recovery of credit is greatly facilitated by boosting the loss
absorption capacity of lenders as a whole rather than individually—higher capital ratios in
banking systems can bring about more resilience.
Of course, the key caveat is that such resilience is incomplete, in the sense that even with
high capital, financial crisis recessions are still much more painful than normal recessions,
and high capital is not associated with a lower risk of ending up in a financial crisis event.
For that, other policy measures focusing on asset growth and liquidity may be needed.
Overall, history lends support to a more nuanced perspective on bank capital. It plays
its main role not so much in reducing the risks of systemic financial crises, but rather in
somewhat mitigating their social and economic costs—a distinct but still important benefit.

Business cycle peak timing

The local projections empirical analysis in the paper employs business cycle peaks from 1870 to
2008, excluding windows around the two world wars, with projections out to five years ahead, with
the annual panel sample data. Peak dates and their classificaton are as shown in the table below,
where “N” denotes a normal business cycle peak, and “F” denotes a peak associated with a systemic
financial crisis (a crisis within ±2 years of the peak). The dating method uses the Bry and Boschan
(1971) algorithm. In the early sample period, with short business cycles, there can be more than one
peak within the window. In these cases we classify according to historical narratives.

I.2

Deposit insurance

The presence or absence of deposit insurance could affect the link between capital structure and
crisis risk. Without deposit insurance, short-term debtors have incentives to monitor banks and force
them to endogenously increase capital when they take more risk. When deposit insurance is in place,
debtor control is weakened and risk-shifting incentives emerge more strongly. In Table A.8 we repeat
the analysis from Table 5, but split the sample depending on whether a deposit insurance scheme
is in place or not. We estimate separate models for the two subsamples consisting of observations
with deposit insurance (DI), and without (No-DI). Unsurprisingly, the number of observations is
higher in the No-DI sample, as deposit insurance was introduced in the mid to late 20th century in
most countries. We include changes in credit/GDP, plus country fixed effects, along with risk and
macroeconomic controls. With deposit insurance, capital ratios are no longer positively correlated
with crisis risk. The coefficient estimate turns negative, but remains statistically weak. A similar
pattern emerges for 5-year average annual changes in capital ratios. Once more, we find little
evidence that lower capital predicts excessive risk taking by banks. Interestingly, it is only after the
introduction of deposit insurance, that the non-core ratio—representing the remaining runnable
debt on bank balance sheets—begins to play an important role (see column (8)).

Market value of capital

We use data from Datastream on the price-to-book ratios for country level bank indices to compute
this measure. Including this data causes our sample size to change substantially as the price-to-book
ratio is only available for 14 of our 17 sample countries starting in 1973 or later.11

Based on the price-to-book ratio and our balance sheet data, we compute market leverage as:12
Market Leverage ≡

Market Value of Equity
= Price-to-book Ratio × Capital Ratio .
Book Value of Assets

(8)

Column (1) of Table A.9 shows that, even with this measure, there is still no systematic relationship between bank capital and banking crises. Moreover, measured by the AUC, the market
capital measure does not add any predictive power. In column (2) we additionally control for
macroeconomic risks and house price changes and their volatility. We do not include bank risk
premiums here, as bank equity risk premiums are closely related to changes in market capitalization.
The coefficient on capital turns negative (the “right” sign), but remains insignificant, in just this one
specification. Columns (3) and (4) confirm that short-run variation in this measure is unrelated to
crisis risk. In short, the results are in line with our previous findings.

11 There

is insufficient data on price-to-book ratios for bank indices in Finland, Norway and Sweden.
that the price-to-book ratio is market value divided by book value of equity and our capital ratio
was defined as book value of capital divided by total assets. The price-to-book measure is only available for
listed banks contained in the bank index. Hence, we have to assume that this ratio is representative for the
entire banking sector.
12 Note

A13

I.4

Concentration of risk

Aggregate capital ratios could mask substantial heterogeneity within banking systems and risks
could be highly concentrated in a few, systemically important institutions or in a subset of banks
with very low capital ratios. Our data do not have sufficient granularity for each country to subject
these mechanisms to empirical tests. However, we can analyze these mechanisms based on available
data for various subsamples. We turn to this now. First, we study whether capital ratios at the most
highly levered banks helps predict a financial crisis. Here we rely on evidence from Italy, where the
Historical Archive of Credit (Natoli, Piselli, Triglia, and Vercelli, 2016) contains micro-level balance
sheet data for the near-universe of banks over more than 80 years, from 1890 to 1973. In a second
step, we focus on the capital at the biggest banks, where we have data for a few countries.

During the period for which we have data, Italy experienced five systemic banking crises: 1893,
1907, 1921, 1930, and 1935. For our analysis, we use all observations on joint-stock banks and savings
banks that are present at least 5 years in the sample and have a market share larger than 0.1% in the

A14

respective year. We exclude cooperative banks as these were sampled only every 5 years. For all the
remaining banks we observe the capital ratio yearly.
In Figure A.7 we present the evolution of different percentiles of the capital ratio distribution
per year. The paths of the 5th (red dot), the 10th (orange dash), and the 25th percentiles (green long
dash) of the distribution of capital ratios across banks display a similar time series pattern as the
aggregate ratio (blue solid) used in our macro-level analysis. In addition, the distribution becomes
less dispersed over time. Unlike today, it does not seem to be the case that the largest banks have
the lowest capital ratios. The banks contained in the 10th percentile for example fluctuate between
6% and 10% of market share, measured by total assets, between 1890 and 1973.
Table A.10 confirms this impression. We again estimate a probit model with the crisis dummy
as the dependent variable and the lagged capital ratio as an explanatory variable, excluding war
years from the sample. Yet instead of only using the aggregate capital ratio, we also use various
percentiles of the capital ratio distribution.
The results reported are consistent with our previous findings. The lagged level of the capital
ratio is positively associated with financial instability. The coefficients are insignificant, but similar
to the one for the aggregate measure in the same sample. The aggregate measure has the highest
AUC, but AUC differences across columns are insignificant. These findings were also confirmed
when we re-estimated the specifications using the 5-year changes in capital ratios instead of lagged
levels.

A15

I.5

Capitalization of the largest banks

The capitalization of the largest and systemically important banks could be key to understanding
financial crisis risks. In fact, current regulations often contain capital surcharges for large and
inter-connected institutions. Hence, we test whether low or falling capital ratios of the largest banks
signal growing financial fragility.
The analysis in this section builds on micro-data collected and kindly shared by Mazbouri et al.
(2017) for a subset of the largest banks in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and the
UK for the period 1890 to 1970. We extended the coverage using data for the same set of banks
in France, Germany, Switzerland, and the UK. We also added recent data from statistics for large
commercial banks from the OECD Banking Statistics. In addition, we collected additional data from
Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the US. The capital ratio measure used here
is now an asset-weighted capital ratio of the largest banks.
The core results are presented in Table A.11. Column (1) shows the baseline regression including
the lagged capital ratio of the largest banks for the full sample. Column (2) includes our control
variables. Columns (3) and (4) repeat these these specifications in post-WW2 data. The results are
similar to our previous findings. As in the aggregated data, the coefficient estimates are positive
in the full sample. They turn negative, but insignificant, when estimated on a post-WW2 sample.
In columns (5) to (8) we look at short-run variation and use 5-year changes instead of the capital
ratio levels. The coefficients are negative, but insignificant and without adding predictive power as
measured by the AUCs.

Notes: The table shows probit classification models where the dependent variable is the financial crisis dummy. All models include
country fixed effects. Coefficients are marginal effects. Interactions are between lagged 5-year average annual changes in loans-to-GDP
and dummies indicating whether the lagged capital ratio is above (high) or below (low) the respective sample median. Macrocontrols
includes volatilities of real GDP per capita, inflation and short-term interest rates as well as averaged real GDP per capita growth,
inflation, and short term interest rates over the previous five years. Asset risks include average changes of real house prices and the
volatility of house price growth over the previous five years and three lags of log excess returns on the bank index if available, on the
general index otherwise. See text. Clustered (by country) standard errors in parentheses. ∗ p < 0.10, ∗∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗∗ p < 0.01

Rapid balance sheet expansions—that is, credit booms—lie at the heart of financial crisis
dynamics. If more skin in the game induces prudent behavior by banks, we would expect to find in
the data that credit booms occurring at high levels of bank equity are considerably less likely to end
in a crisis than credit booms financed with less equity. Hence we define an indicator variable for
high levels of capital, specifically when the lagged capital ratio of the banking sector is above the
median in the respective sample.
We then test the proposition using interaction terms in our original model. Table A.12 provides
no support for the view that higher capital has disciplining effects. The interaction coefficients
for 5-year average annual credit expansion and the indicator for a high capital ratio are typically
positive, for the full sample and the post-WW2 period. This holds both for book values of capital
(columns 1 to 4) and market values of capital (columns 5 and 6). The inclusion of controls for asset
risk and macroeconomic risk predictors lowers the coefficients, but does not change the overall
picture. Credit booms financed with more capital are as dangerous as credit booms financed with
more debt.

Instrumenting changes in capital ratios

The surprising finding that more capital increases the likelihood of a crisis (albeit by a very small
amount indistinguishable from zero statistically) runs counter to intuition. Thus, our strategy of
controlling for observable factors that simultaneously explain crisis risk and are correlated with
capital may have been insufficient. Regulators, market participants, or both could force banks to
increase capital buffers when crisis risk is perceived to be high. This type of simultaneity bias could
be masking the true relationship. Here, we will use an instrumental variable approach to address
potential endogeneity. The instrument relies on variation in the wiggle room that banks have to
adjust capital buffers by retaining profits. Cohen and Scatigna (2016) show that retained earnings
have been the most important source of bank capital increases in advanced economies after the
financial crisis and that banks also retained a significant fraction of earnings in earlier periods.

Notes: The figure shows binned scatterplots for 5-year average changes in capital ratios and 5-year average changes in RoA. Observations
are collapsed into 20 equal sized bins according to 5-year average annual changes in RoA. Each point represents the group specific means
of 5-year average annual changes in capital ratios and 5-year average annual changes in RoA. A fitted regression line is shown in red.

This behavior is also reflected in balance sheet data. As of 2018Q3, undivided profits account
for 37.8% of total bank equity capital of commercial and savings banks in the US, which is slightly
below the average share for the post-1984 period.13 The higher profits are relative to total assets,
the more banks can increase capital ratios by retaining these profits in the bank. Hence, retained
earnings are a natural instrument for variation in capital ratios that can be justifiably be considered
independent of perceptions of impending financial fragility.
We will exploit this relationship using data for banking sector profit and loss accounts from
Richter and Zimmermann (2018) and instrument changes in capital ratios with changes in return on
assets (RoA), the ratio of net income after tax to book assets. We define the 5-year change in this
variable as ∆5 RoAi,t = RoAi,t − RoAi,t−5 . Including controls for asset growth and bank risk premia
ensures that we capture only variation in capital ratios that is driven by changes in RoA that are
unrelated to risk taking, following Meiselman et al. (2018). For the instrument to be relevant, a
positive first-stage association between changes in RoA and changes in the capital ratio is required.
13 Numbers

are based on data from the ”FDIC - Quarterly Banking Profile Time Series Spreadsheets”.

A29

Figure A.8 presents evidence of such a strong relationship between 5-year average changes in RoA
and 5-year average changes in capital ratios.
There is no formal way to evaluate the validity of the instrument with just identification, as it
is the case here. However, the economic justification seems clear. In good times, returns on assets
increase. Banks will then retain some of the higher profits earned. Controlling for asset growth and
bank risk, banks acquire more “skin in the game,” which in turn allows us to evaluate whether
it reduces future crisis risk. It turns out that even as we are able to obtain a more intuitive link
between capital and crisis risk, this link is tenuous economically and statistically, as we will see next.
Table A.24 presents the instrumental variable probit results for the post-WW2 sample and starts
from a simple benchmark model including only changes in the loans-to-GDP ratio over the previous
five years, as shown in the first column; this model has an AUC of 0.75. In the second column,
we now add changes in the capital ratio over the last five years. The change in the capital ratio
is insignificant—just as in our previous exercises—and it does not add any predictive accuracy
to the benchmark model; the AUC is still 0.75. In column (3), the IV model now instruments
changes in the capital ratio with changes in RoA. The first-stage regression (unreported) confirms
the relevance of the instrument and has an F-statistic of 45.05. The coefficient for changes in
capital ratios instrumented with RoA turns negative. But the coefficient of the capital ratio remains
insignificant and does not add any predictive accuracy in comparison to previous models. Thus, if
our IV strategy purges the estimates of endogeneity, it does not alter our main finding. Columns (4)
to (6) follow the same strategy, but also include macrocontrols and asset risks as in our previous
exercises. The message of the table is clear: changes in capital ratios are unrelated to financial crisis
risks, even when we account for endogeneity. The results are statistically and economically small.

Notes: The table shows probit classification models where the dependent variable is the financial crisis dummy. Column (1) includes
lagged 5-year average annual changes in loans-to-GDP. Column (2) additionally includes lagged 5-year average annual changes in
capital ratios. In column (3) 5-year average annual changes in capital ratios are instrumented with 5-year average annual changes in
RoA. The F-statistic of the first stage regression for this model is 45.05. Columns (4), (5) and (6) additionally include macrocontrols
and asset risks. Macrocontrols includes volatilities of real GDP per capita, inflation and short-term interest rates as well as averaged
real GDP per capita growth, inflation, and short term interest rates over the previous five years. Asset risks include average changes of
real house prices and the volatility of house price growth over the previous five years and three lags of log excess returns on the bank
index if available, on the general index otherwise. Coefficients shown are marginal effects. All models include country fixed effects.

Recession

Notes: Standard errors (clustered by country) in parentheses. ∗ p < 0.10, ∗∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗∗ p < 0.01. The dependent variable is the
cumulative change in real GDP per capita from the start of the recession. Financial recessions are binned depending on whether the
lagged capital ratio of the banking sector at the peak was above or below the historical mean.

Estimates in Table A.25 are for the full sample of N = 248 recessions. On average, financial
recessions are worse than normal recessions, as shown by the negative coefficients in the second
and third rows. However, though the path is still much worse than normal, the economy recovers
faster from a financial recession with a well-capitalized banking sector. After 5 years, output per
capita is more than four percentage points lower relative to a normal recession when the banking
sector is poorly capitalized (-7.43%) than otherwise (-2.97%).
Table A.25 reports the p-value of a test of the null that the coefficients for low and high bank
capital ratios at the start of the crisis are equal. The tests show that the coefficients are generally
statistically different from each other (with p-values below 0.10 after year 3). However, economically
speaking, higher bank capital at the onset of a financial crisis coincides with a considerably faster
economic recovery. Over the 5-year period considered, the relative cumulative GDP costs of a
financial crisis with a below-average capitalized banking sector amount, on average, to a loss of
more than 12 percentage points of cumulative GDP as reported in column (6) of the table (compare
-25.40% with -12.79%).
