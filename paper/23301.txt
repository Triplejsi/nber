ABSTRACT
Exploiting a novel geo-referenced data set of population diversity across ethnic groups, this
research advances the hypothesis and empirically establishes that variation in population diversity
across human societies, as determined in the course of the exodus of human from Africa tens of
thousands of years ago, contributed to the differential formation of pre-colonial autocratic
institutions within ethnic groups and the emergence of autocratic institutions across countries.
Diversity has amplified the importance of institutions in mitigating the adverse effects of noncohesiveness on productivity, while contributing to the scope for domination, leading to the
formation of institutions of the autocratic type.

Introduction

Political institutions have been widely viewed as major determinants of economic growth and comparative economic development. The origins of the existing variation in the nature of political
institutions across the globe has been attributed to a variety of proximate factors underlying the
contribution of economic prosperity and the threat of revolution to the onset of democracy as
well as the association between inequality, ethnic fractionalization, and class stratification with
the formation of autocratic intuitions.1 Recently, attention has been drawn towards more fundamental factors that have been argued to a↵ect the nature of the prevailing political institutions
across former colonies, highlighting institutional legacy as well as economic incentives that lead to
the implementation of di↵erential political institutions by the various colonial powers in di↵erent
geographical environments.2
This research explores the origins of variation in the nature and the persistence of pre-colonial
political institutions, highlighting one of the deepest roots of autocracy molded during the dawn
of the dispersion of anatomically modern humans across the globe.3 The study advances the
hypothesis and establishes empirically that variation in the population diversity across human
societies, as determined in the course of the exodus of Homo sapiens out of Africa tens of thousands
of years ago, shaped the characteristics of political institutions in early stages of development and
has persistently a↵ected the attributes of contemporary institutions across societies.
The hypothesized contribution of population diversity to the emergence of autocratic institutions rests on two fundamental building blocks. First, in view of the adverse e↵ect of population
diversity on social cohesiveness and aggregate productivity, the emergence of formal or informal
institutions, and their associated code of conduct, would have plausibly mitigated the detrimental
e↵ects of population heterogeneity on the efficiency of the productive process. The scope for the
emergence of institutions has therefore been larger in more diverse societies. Second, population
diversity, and its manifestation in heterogeneity in cognitive as well as physical traits, has conceivably fostered the degree of inequality and class stratification in society, amplifying the scope for
domination, and permitting elites to implement autocratic institutions. Thus, the dual e↵ect of
population diversity on the demand for institutions and on class stratification has contributed to
the emergence of autocratic institutions.4

Furthermore, pre-colonial state formation has been attributed to the establishment of sedentary communities
and the subsequent rise in social complexity in the post-Neolithic Revolution era (Mann, 1986; Belfer-Cohen and BarYosef, 2002). State formation has been associated with the rise in population density in the post-Neolithic period
(Diamond, 1997), the rise in food surplus necessary for the creation of a non-food producing class due to climatic
shocks, technological advancements, and the gains from trade (Gosden, 1989; Allen, 1997; Arnold, 1993; Fenske, 2014;
Litina, 2014), and the existence of storable crops that permitted extraction by the ruling elite Mayshar et al. (2015).

The hypothesis that genetic diversity is associated with the scope for domination is supported by evidence from
stow of the closest species to human beings. The Chimpanzees whose level of genetic diversity of 0.82, is larger
than the one present in the human species (Pemberton et al., 2013) are characterized by extreme social stratification
associated with a dominating alpha male. In contrast, the Bonobo, that diverged from the common chimpanzees
due to their geographical isolation dictated by the Congo River, are characterized by greater genetic homogeneity
and more egalitarian. This evidence suggests that the hypothesis advanced in this paper may be relevant for the

The conjectured e↵ect of population diversity on the degree of autocratic institutions and the
proposed mechanism that governs this e↵ect are examined empirically across ethnic groups during
the pre-colonial era as well as across nations during the contemporary period. The ethnic level
empirical analysis is conducted on a novel geo-referenced dataset consisting of ethnic groups, for
which population diversity is either observed, or can be predicted, and geographic, ethnographic
and institutional characteristics are mostly available, whereas the country-level empirical analysis
exploits existing data on population diversity as constructed by Ashraf and Galor (2013).
The empirical analysis is conducted in several layers as outlined in Figure 1. The first layer
of the empirical analysis explores the impact of population diversity on the degree of autocratic
institutions across ethnic groups, as well as the hypothesized mechanism that governs this reducedform relationship. In particular, consistent with the conjecture that ethnic groups characterized
by higher population diversity are more likely to form institutions that would mitigate the adverse
e↵ect of the inherent non-cohesiveness associated with diversity, the empirical analysis establishes
that, among the ethnic groups for which data on observed population diversity and institutions
are available, ethnic groups that are characterized by a higher level of population diversity tend to
possess more elaborate institutions, as captured by the degree of jurisdictional hierarchy in those
societies, accounting for potentially confounding geographical characteristics as well as regional
fixed e↵ects.
In light of potential concerns about the endogeneity of observed population diversity and the
size and the representativeness of the ethnic group sample with observed population diversity, the
research exploits two empirical strategies to identify the causal e↵ect of population diversity on
autocracy and to demonstrate the robustness of the estimated e↵ect. First, in view of the negative
e↵ect of migratory distance from the cradle of humankind in East Africa to various settlements
across the globe on population diversity, migratory distance from Africa is exploited as an instrumental variable for observed population diversity, establishing a highly significant causal e↵ect of
diversity on the degree of jurisdictional hierarchy. Second, using migratory distance from Africa to
predict population diversity for 1,267 ethnic groups in the Ethnographic Atlas, the analysis further
establishes the robustness of the result for this extended sample.
Further, consistent with the second element of the proposed mechanism about the impact
of population diversity on social stratification, the empirical analysis establishes that, among the
ethnic groups for which data on observed population diversity and social stratification are available,
ethnic groups that are characterized by a higher level of population diversity tend to have a higher
level of class stratification. In addition, among the ethnic groups for which data on observed
population diversity and the presence of slavery are available, ethnic groups that are characterized
by a higher level of population diversity tend to be have a higher intensity of slavery. Moreover,
exploiting migratory distance from Africa as: (i) an instrumental variable for observed population
diversity, and (ii) to predict population diversity for all ethnic groups in the Ethnographic Atlas, the
undersetting of the emergence of domination across variety of groups distinguished regardless of their scale or their
cognitive functioning.

empirical analysis establishes a highly significant causal and robust e↵ect of population diversity on
class stratification and the intensity of slavery, accounting for potentially confounding geographical
characteristics as well as regional fixed e↵ects.
Moreover, the ethnic-level empirical analysis explores the contribution of the dual e↵ect of population diversity, on the emergence of intuitions as well as on the degree of social stratification,
to the emergence of autocratic institutions. In line with the proposed mechanism, the empirical
analysis establishes that the number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchy and the degree of social
stratification are associated with the presence of autocratic institutions, captured by various measures reported by the Standard Cross Cultural Survey (SCCS) such as: (i) degree of absence of
checks on leader’s power, (ii) difficulty of removal of leaders, (iii) leader’s exercise of authority, (iv)
degree of lack of community decisions, and (v) perception of leader’s power. Hence, these findings indicate that the impact of diversity on the prevalence of autocratic institutions could have
plausibly operated through its dual e↵ect on the formation of institutions as well as class stratification. Finally, the ethnic-level analysis suggests that there exists a positive reduced-form e↵ect of
predicted population diversity on the various measures of autocracy reported by the SCCS.
Thus, consistent with the proposed hypothesis, the first layer of empirical analysis suggests that
population diversity contributed to the degree of pre-colonial autocratic institutions across ethnic
groups, while lending credence to the hypothesized mechanism that governs this reduced-form
relationship, according to which population diversity contributed to the demand for institutions as
well as for the scope for domination, giving rise to institutions of the autocratic type.
The second layer of the empirical analysis explores that importance of the impact of population diversity on pre-colonial autocratic institutions across ethnic groups for understanding the
contemporary variation in autocratic institutions across nations. In particular, it examines the
persistence of ethnic institutions that were formed in the pre-colonial era and their association
with contemporary national institutions. Aggregating pre-colonial ethnic institutions into precolonial national institutions, the analysis suggests that indeed pre-colonial ethnic institutions have
contributed to the contemporary institutions, beyond the persistent e↵ect of geographical determinants. In particular, the degree of autocratic institutions and the absence of executive constraints
in the contemporary period are positively and significantly associated with the degree of autocratic
institutions in the pre-colonial era, accounting for potentially confounding e↵ects of geographical
characteristics and population diversity. Moreover, the findings suggest that the persistence of institutions can be partly attributed to the direct e↵ect of population diversity on both pre-colonial
and contemporary institutions.
The third layer of the empirical analysis examines the reduced-form relationship between population diversity and the nature of contemporary national institutions. Consistent with the proposed
hypothesis, it establishes that population diversity at the national level, as captured by predicted
population diversity has a significant direct e↵ect on the degree of autocracy across countries and
of the absence of executive constraints, accounting for a large number of confounding geographical
characteristics, regional fixed e↵ects, colonial history (i.e., duration and colonizer nation), legal ori-

gins, pre-colonial development and ethnolinguistic fractionalization (and its geographical origins).
Moreover, the e↵ect remains nearly intact if one accounts for arguably endogenous controls such
as income per capita and education.
Thus, the third layer of the empirical analysis suggests that the spatial distribution of population
diversity across the globe has also contributed to contemporary variation in the degree of autocracy
across countries. This reduced-form e↵ect of population diversity on the prevalence of contemporary
autocratic institutions across nations may reflect either persistence of institutions from the precolonial to the modern era, as established in the second layer of the analysis, or a direct e↵ect of
population diversity on contemporary autocratic institutions, capturing the e↵ect of diversity on
the demand for institutions as well as for the scope for domination.

2.1

Empirical Framework
Empirical Strategy

This research advances the hypothesis that diversity contributed to the concentration of power
over the course of human history within social groups, such as ethnic groups or nation states.
Furthermore, it suggests that this e↵ect was governed by the impact of population diversity on the
emergence of institutions as well as on the degree of social stratification.

4

The proposed hypothesis is examined empirically across ethnic groups during the pre-colonial
era as well as across nations during the contemporary period. This empirical setup is desirable
for several reasons. First, the inclusion of the pre-colonial as well as the modern era is designed
to capture the e↵ect of institutions over the course of human history. Second, the analysis of the
pre-colonial era as well as the modern one permits the analyses to capture the e↵ect of population
diversity across groups of various dimensions (i.e., ethnic groups as well as nations). Third, in
view of the important e↵ect of colonialism on institutions, the pre-colonial analysis is immune from
the potential confounding e↵ect of colonialization. Fourth, this intertemporal setup permits the
examination of the persistence e↵ect of pre-colonial institutions on the contemporary ones and it
allows the isolation of the direct e↵ect of population diversity on contemporary institutions from
its lingering e↵ect via the persistence of past institutions. Fifth, the focus on ethnic groups permits
that analysis to disentangle the e↵ect of phenotypic diversity (within an ethnic group) from ethnic
diversity (across groups).

2.2

Measure of Population Diversity

This research highlights the pivotal contribution of population diversity for the emergence of autocratic institutions. While population diversity can be captured by ethnolinguistic fractionalization,
ethnolinguistic polarization, or genetic diversity, several reasons suggests that genetic diversity
ought to be used in order to properly capture the hypothesized e↵ects of population diversity.
First, while population diversity at the national level can be captured by each of the three
measures, diversity within ethnic groups can be captured only by existing measures of genetic diversity. Second, for the country level analysis, measures of ethnolinguistic fractionalization captures
primarily the proportional representation of each ethnic group in the population, while measures
of ethnic polarization incorporate proxies for pairwise dissimilarities amongst ethnic groups within
the population. In contrast, the genetic diversity of a national population is an index that incorporates information on all three dimensions of heterogeneity at the country level: the proportional
representation of each ethnic group, the pairwise dissimilarities across these groups (as captured
by genetic distance), and most importantly, the degree of interpersonal diversity within each group
(as captured by genetic diversity within the group). Third, since the hypothesized e↵ect population diversity on inequality and social stratification is operating via heterogeneity in cognitive as
well as physical traits, the measure of population diversity ought to reflect phenotypic diversity.
A-priori the degree of either fractionalization or polarization does not necessarily reflect the degree
of phenotypic diversity, whereas genetic diversity is correlated with phenotypic diversity.
Thus the study employs various measures of genetic diversity (i.e., observed genetic diversity
within ethnic groups, predicted genetic diversity within ethnic groups, predicted genetic diversity
within countries, and ancestry adjusted predicted genetic diversity within countries) to capture
population diversity.

2.2.1

Observed Population Diversity within Ethnic Groups

Population geneticists use an index known as expected heterozygosity to measure the extent of
diversity in genetic material across individuals in a given population (e.g., an ethnic group). Genetic
diversity captures the probability that two individuals, selected at random from a given population,
di↵er from one another with respect to a spectrum of genetic traits. In particular, the overall
expected heterozygosity for a given population is the average gene-specific heterozygosity (based
on the proportional representations of di↵erent alleles of this trait in the population) over multiple
DNA loci.
Existing measures of expected heterozygosity for indigenous ethnic groups are created by population geneticists utilizing data on allelic frequencies within a particular class of DNA loci labelled
microsatellites, located in non-protein-coding regions of the human genome and are largely regarded as selectively neutral. This attribute has a major advantage, assuring that this measure of
genetic diversity is una↵ected by factors that are correlated with political institutions that could
have governed the process of natural selection. Nevertheless, a conceptually meaningful measure
of genetic diversity (i.e., a measure that can capture the e↵ect of political and economic outcomes)
ought to reflect diversity in phenotypically expressed traits. Reassuringly, diversity in microsatellites is positively correlated with heterogeneity in phenotypically expressed genomic material. In
particular, similarly to expected heterozygosity in neutral genetic markers, evidence suggests that
a serial founder e↵ect associated with migratory distance from East Africa has a negative e↵ect on
various forms of morphological and cognitive diversity (Henn et al., 2012), including diversity in
skeletal features pertaining to cranial characteristics (Manica et al., 2007; von Cramon-Taubadel
and Lycett, 2008; Betti et al., 2013), dental characterisitics (Hanihara, 2008), and pelvic attributes
(Betti et al., 2013), as well as phonemic diversity (Atkinson, 2011).
This research employs a newly assembled data (Pemberton et al., 2013) on observed genetic
diversity in 232 predominantly indigenous ethnic groups across the globe that have been largely
isolated from genetic flows from other ethnic groups.5 The distribution of these ethnic groups across
the globe is depicted in Figure 2 and the summary statistics of this measure of genetic diversity as
documented in Table B.1 establishes that observed genetic diversity ranges from 0.77 in Africa to
0.58 in South America.6 Moreover, the study creates a novel geo-referenced dataset consisting of

5

This dataset combines eight human genetic diversity datasets based on the 645 loci that they share, including
the HGDP-CEPH Human Genome Diversity Cell Line Panel used by Ashraf and Galor (2013).
6
The analysis excludes observations that are not marked as clean by Pemberton et al. (2013). These omitted
observations either reflect genetic diversity of a large geographical region (e.g., Patagonia), rather than an ethnic
group, or ethnicities that were subjected to significant admixture. Furthermore, it excludes two ethnicities (the
Surui and the Ache of South America) that are largely viewed as extreme outliers in terms of genetic diversity (e.g.
Wang et al., 2007). The exclusion of these ethnicities is not particular to our study. In particular, Ramachandran
et al. (2005) omits the Surui, being “an extreme outlier in a variety of previous analyses”, and did not include the
Ache either. Furthermore, these ethnicities have the lowest levels of genetic diversity in the clean sample and the
largest residuals of an OLS regression of genetic diversity on migratory distance from Addis Ababa. Including these
observations, nevertheless, does not a↵ect the qualitative analysis.

ethnic groups, for which observed population diversity is matched to geographic, ethnographic and
institutional characteristics.7
2.2.2

Predicted Population Diversity within Ethnic Groups

The research exploits the tight negative relationship between migratory distance from East Africa
and observed genetic diversity across the ethnic group in the sample of Pemberton et al (2013) in
order to generate a measure of predicted genetic diversity for all ethnic group in the Ethnographic
Atlas, overcoming sample limitations as well as potential concerns about omitted variables and
reverse causality that may a↵ect the relationship between observed genetic diversity and political
institutions.8
The composition of genetic traits within populations has evolved in the course of a stepwise
migration process of anatomically modern human out of Africa 90,000–60,000 BP. The “out of
Africa” migration was associated with a decline in the degree of genetic diversity in populations
that settled at greater migratory distances from Africa. In particular, following the serial founder
e↵ect, since the spatial di↵usion of humans occurred in a sequence of steps, in which a subgroup
of individuals left their parental colony to establish a new settlement farther away, carrying only
a subset of the genetic diversity of their parental colony, the extent of genetic diversity observed
within an indigenous ethnic group decreases with its migratory distance from East Africa (e.g.,

7
A georeferenced mapping of the ethnographic characteristics of the ethnic groups to shed light on contemporary
cultural traits was first introduced by Nunn (2008).
8
Since predicted population diversity for each of the ethnic groups in the sample is a generated regressor, the
analysis based on predicted population diversity employs a two-step bootstrapping algorithm to compute the standard
errors (Table B.2 and B.3 in the Appendix).

Figure 3: This figure depicts the negative impact of migratory distance from East Africa on genetic
diversity across the 230 ethnic groups in the sample. The location of each ethnic group and its
degree of genetic diversity is represented by a point and a World Bank code of the country in which
the ethnic group resides.

Harpending and Rogers 2000; Ramachandran et al. 2005; Prugnolle, Manica, and Balloux 2005;
Ashraf and Galor 2013b).9
Reflecting this chain of ancient population bottlenecks originating in East Africa, the scatter
plot in Figure 3 depicts the highly significant negative e↵ect of migratory distance from the cradle of
mankind in East Africa on genetic diversity in the ethnic-group sample of Pemberton et al (2013).
In particular, regressing genetic diversity on migratory distance from Addis Ababa in this sample
suggest that expected heterozygosity falls by 6.7 percentage points for every 10,000 km increase
in migratory distance from East Africa. Furthermore, migratory distance explains more than 84
percent of the cross-group variation in observed genetic diversity.10
9
In the pre-colonial era, the geographical locations of societies reflected the locations to which their ancestral
populations had arrived at the culmination of their prehistoric “out of Africa” migration from the cradle of humankind,
and as such, the diversity of a precolonial society was presumably determined by the ancient serial founder e↵ect
originating in East Africa.
10
As further elaborated in the Appendix, in estimating the migratory distance from Addis Ababa (East Africa)
for each of the ethnic groups in the data, the shortest traversable paths from Addis Ababa to the interior centroid
of each ethnic group was computed. Given the limited ability of humans to travel across large bodies of water, the
traversable area included bodies of water at a distance of 100km from land mass (excluding migration from Africa
into Europe via Italy or Spain).

The distribution of ethnic groups across the globe in this predicted diversity sample is depicted
in Figure 2 and the summary statistics of this measure of genetic diversity as documented in Table
B.1 establishes that observed genetic diversity ranges from 0.77 in Africa to 0.59 in South America.
2.2.3

Predicted Population Diversity within Countries

While the observed and predicted population diversity for ethnic groups is sufficient in order to conduct the ethnic-level analysis, the examination of the e↵ect of population diversity on autocratic
institutions across countries requires the use of a genetic diversity measure for national populations. However, national contemporary populations are composed of multiple ethnicities, which
may not be indigenous to their current geographical locations. Thus, one needs to construct an
index of genetic diversity for contemporary national populations that accounts for the proportional
representation of each ethnic group within the country, the expected heterozygosity within each
subnational group, as well as the diversity that arises from the genetic distances between the precolonial ancestral populations. Hence, the country-level analysis employs the measure of genetic
diversity, as constructed by Ashraf and Galor (2013b), accounting for these three important elements of population diversity with a national population.11 The summary statistics of this measure
of genetic diversity is documented in Table B.1.

2.3

Measures of Political Institutions, Autocracy, and Social Stratification

In view of the hypothesis that diversity contributed to demand for institutions as well as to the
emergence of pre-colonial autocratic institutions which persisted over time and a↵ected the nature
of contemporary institutions, measures of pre-colonial institutions and pre-colonial and modern
autocracy will be used.
For the analysis of pre-colonial institutions, the study exploits the arguably largest and most
comprehensive collection of ethnographic tabulations found in the Ethnographic Atlas, consisting
of ethnographic data for 1,267 worldwide ethnic groups (Murdock, 1967). Pre-colonial ethic level
institutions are captured by “Jurisdictional Hierarchy Beyond Local Community”, as reported by
the Ethnographic Atlas. This widely used measure of pre-colonial institution (or statehood) consists
of five gradations: (i) no political authority beyond the local community, (ii) one level (e.g., petty
chiefdoms), (iii) two levels (e.g., larger chiefdoms), (iv) three levels (e.g., states), and (v) four levels
(e.g., large states).
The presence of autocratic institutions in the pre-colonial era is captured by various measures
such as: (i) degree of absence of checks on leader’s power, (ii) difficulty of removal of leaders, (iii)
leader’s exercise of authority, (iv) degree of lack of community decisions, and (v) perception of
leader’s power, as reported by the Standard Cross Cultural Survey (Murdock and White, 1969).
Furthermore, the degree of contemporary autocratic institutions is captured by the indexes of

Since predicted population diversity for each country is a generated regressor, the empirical analysis based on
predicted population diversity employs a two-step bootstrapping algorithm to compute the standard errors (Table

research in political institutions: The Polity IV Project dataset (Marshall et al., 2014).
In light of the hypothesis that diversity contributed to the degree of social stratification, contributing to the emergence of pre-colonial autocratic institutions, various measures of social stratification will be used. First, “Class Stratification” as reported by the Ethnographic Atlas. This
measure of social stratification is aggregated into three gradations: (i) absence of stratification,
(ii) the presence of wealth distinctions or elite, and (iii) the presence of complex social classes or
hereditary aristocracy.

Population Diversity and Autocracy in the Pre-Colonial Era

This section explores the impact of population diversity on the degree of pre-colonial autocratic
institutions across ethnic groups. Moreover, it examines the hypothesized mechanism that may
govern this reduced-form relationship. In particular, it investigates: (i) the e↵ect of population
diversity on pre-colonial jurisdictional hierarchy, (ii) the e↵ect of population diversity on pre-colonial
social stratification and slavery, (iii) the associations between pre-colonial jurisdictional hierarchy,
social stratification and slavery, on the one hand, and pre-colonial autocracy on the other hand,
and (iv) the e↵ect of population diversity on pre-colonial autocracy.
In view of the conjecture that ethnic groups characterized by higher population diversity are
more likely to form institutions that would mitigate the adverse e↵ect of non-cohesiveness on
productivity, the empirical analysis first examines whether ethnic groups that are characterized
by a higher level of observed population diversity tend to possess more elaborate institutions, as
captured by the degree of jurisdictional hierarchy in those societies.
In light of potential concerns about the endogeneity of observed population diversity as well as
the size and the representativeness of the ethnic group sample with observed population diversity,
the research exploits two empirical strategies to identify the causal e↵ect of population diversity
on autocracy and to demonstrate the robustness of the estimated e↵ect. First, migratory distance
from Africa is exploited as an instrumental variable for observed population diversity, in order to
examine the potential causal e↵ect of diversity on the degree of jurisdictional hierarchy, accounting
for the potentially confounding e↵ects of geographical characteristics as well as regional fixed e↵ects.
Second, using migratory distance from Africa to predict population diversity for 1,267 ethnic groups
in the Ethnographic Atlas, the analysis explores the robustness of the result for this extended
sample.
Further, in light of the second element of the proposed mechanism about the impact of population diversity on social stratification, the empirical analysis explores whether ethnic groups that
are characterized by a higher level of observed population diversity tend to have a higher level of
class stratification and a higher intensity of slavery. Moreover, exploiting migratory distance from
Africa as: (i) an instrumental variable for observed population diversity, and (ii) as a predictor
of population diversity for all ethnic groups in the Ethnographic Atlas, the empirical analysis ex-

as regional fixed e↵ects.
Finally, the ethnic-level empirical analysis explores the contribution of population diversity to
the emergence of autocratic institutions. In light of the proposed mechanism, the empirical analysis
explores the association between jurisdictional hierarchy and the presence of autocratic institutions
as captured by: (i) degree of absence of checks on leader’s power, (ii) difficulty of removal of leaders,
(iii) leader’s exercise of authority, (iv) degree of lack of community decisions, and (v) perception
of leader’s power, Furthermore, it examines the association between social stratification and the
intensity of slavery and these measures of autocracy. Moreover, the empirical analysis explores the
reduced-form e↵ect of predicted population diversity on each of these measures of autocracy.

Baseline Regression Specifications

This section presents the baseline econometric models that will be used in the empirical analysis
of the relationship between population diversity and autocracy in the pre-colonial era.
3.1.1

Population Diversity and Ethnographic Characteristics

In estimating the association between observed population diversity and pre-colonial (i) jurisdictional hierarchy, (ii) stratification, and (iii) intensity of slavery, the following empirical specification
is adopted and estimated via ordinary least squares (OLS):12
Yi =

0

+

1 Gi

+ Xi0

+ "i ,

(1)

where Yi is a measure of either jurisdictional hierarchy, social stratification, or intensity of slavery,
for ethnicity i; Gi is observed population diversity for ethnicity i, Xi is a vector of potentially
confounding geographical control variables for ethnicity i; Ci is a vector of continental dummies for
ethnicity i; and "i is an error term clustered at the country level for ethnicity i.
Moreover, considering the remarkably strong predictive power of migratory distance from East
Africa for genetic diversity, the baseline regression specification employed to test the e↵ect of
predicted population diversity on pre-colonial (i) jurisdictional hierarchy, (ii) stratification, and (iii)
intensity of slavery (in the extended sample of the entire set of ethnic groups in the Ethnographic
Atlas) is estimated via OLS based on the following empirical specification:13

(i.e., ordered probit).

where Ĝi is the level of population diversity predicted by migratory distance from East Africa for
ethnicity i.
Furthermore, the causal e↵ect of population diversity on pre-colonial jurisdictional hierarchy,
stratification, and inequality is estimated via a 2SLS procedure, instrumenting observed population
diversity with the migratory distance from East Africa in the sample of observed genetic diversity.
In particular, the second stage of the 2SLS regression is given by equation (1), while the first stage
of the 2SLS regression is estimated by the equation
Gi = ↵0 + a1 Zi + Xi0 ↵2 + Ci0 ↵3 + "i ,

(3)

where Zi is the migratory distance from East Africa to the centroid of the homeland of ethnicity i.
3.1.2

Ethnographic Characteristics and Pre-Colonial Autocracy

In estimating the association between pre-colonial autocracy and pre-colonial (i) jurisdictional
hierarchy, (ii) stratification, and (iii) intensity of slavery, the following empirical specification is
adopted and estimated via (OLS):14
Ai =

0

+

+ Xi0

where Ai is a measure of pre-colonial autocracy for ethnicity i; Yi is a measure of either jurisdictional
hierarchy, social stratification, or intensity of slavery, for ethnicity i.

Population Diversity and Pre-Colonial Autocracy

the following empirical specification is adopted and estimated via ordinary least squares (OLS):15
Ai =

by the degree of jurisdictional hierarchy in those societies.

This table presents the results of a series of OLS regression analyses, on the ethnic-group level, of
a measure of pre-colonial jurisdictional hierarchy (the natural logarithm of the number of levels of
jurisdictional hierarchy) on observed genetic diversity, conditional on a range of control variables
at the ethnic-group level. Specifications marked with “Continental FE” accounts for sub-Saharan
Africa, Latin America, and continental fixed e↵ects. Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors are
reported in parentheses. *** Significant at the 1 percent level. ** Significant at the 5 percent level. *
Significant at the 10 percent level.

Table 1 presents the results from OLS regression analyses of the log number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchy in the pre-colonial era on observed population diversity. Consistent with the
prediction of the proposed hypothesis, column 1 establishes a highly statistically and economically significant correlation between the measure of jurisdictional hierarchy and observed genetic
diversity, based on the 131 ethnic groups for which information on both population diversity and
jurisdictional hierarchy is available. In particular, a 1 percentage point increase in observed population diversity is associated with a 2.7 percent increase in the number of levels of jurisdictional
hierarchy. In light of the potentially confounding e↵ects of geographical characteristics on this
association, columns 2–4 establish that this association is robust to the gradual inclusion of control
13

variables, capturing a range of geographical factors. In particular, the association remains highly
significant while accounting for the absolute latitude of the centroid of the homeland of the ethnicity (column 2), soil quality decile fixed e↵ects (column 3),16 and continental fixed e↵ects which
capture unobserved heterogeneity across continents (column 4). In addition, column 5 establishes
that the association remain highly significant while accounting for the potentially confounding effects of elevation of the homelands, terrain ruggedness, length and density of rivers, and the share
of desert. Similarly, column 6 establishes that the association remain highly significant once the
average and range of temperatures is accounted for.
Thus, Table 1 establishes that the estimated association between observed genetic diversity and
pre-colonial jurisdictional hierarchy is highly statistically and economically significant, accounting
for a wide range of potentially confounding geographical characteristics and continental fixed e↵ects.
In particular, a 1 percentage point increase in observed population diversity is associated with a 9.6
percent increase in the number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchy. This partial association between
jurisdictional hierarchy and population diversity, as derived in column 6, is plotted in Panel A of
Figure A.1.
3.2.2

Observed Diversity & Jurisdictional Hierarchy: Instrumental Variable Analysis

In light of potential concerns about the endogeneity of observed population diversity, the second
layer of this empirical analysis exploits an instrumental variable strategy to identify the causal
e↵ect of population diversity on jurisdictional hierarchy. In view of the negative e↵ect of migratory
distance from the cradle of humankind in East Africa to various settlements across the globe on
population diversity, migratory distance from Africa is exploited as an instrumental variable for
observed population diversity, establishing a highly significant causal e↵ect of diversity on the
degree of jurisdictional hierarchy.
Table 2 presents the results from 2SLS regression analyses of the log number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchy in the pre-colonial era on observed population diversity. Interestingly, in
comparison to their OLS counterparts in Table 1, the estimated 2SLS coefficients associated with
the e↵ect of diversity remain relatively stable in magnitude, suggesting that omitted variable bias
or endogeneity of genetic diversity need not be a source of concern. In particular, column 1 establishes that migratory distance from East Africa is a very strong instrument for genetic diversity
(the Kleibergen-Paap F -statistic is 237) and that there is a highly statistically and economically
significant e↵ect of observed genetic diversity on the log number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchy.
In particular, a 1 percentage point increase in the level of observed genetic diversity increases the
number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchy by 2.9 percent.
Furthermore, columns 2–5 establish that this e↵ect is robust to the gradual inclusion of control
variables capturing a range of geographical factors. In particular, migratory distance from East
Africa remains a strong instrument for population diversity, and the e↵ect of population diversity
16

Considering decile fixed e↵ects better accounts for the potential non-linearity of soil-quality on the various
outcomes, but the results are robust to the use of a linear continuous specification.

This table presents the results of a series of 2SLS regression analyses, on the ethnic-group level,

distance from East Africa to the interior centroid of the homeland of the ethnicity, conditional

on jurisdictional hierarchy remains highly significant while controlling for absolute latitude of the
centroid of the homeland of the ethnicity (column 2), soil quality decile fixed e↵ects (column 3),
elevation of the homelands, terrain ruggedness, length and density of rivers, and the share of desert
(column 4), average temperature, as well as the temperature range (column 5). In particular, a 1
percentage point increase in observed genetic diversity increases the number of levels of jurisdictional
hierarchy by 5.2 percent.17
17
In light of the modest sample size of these regressions involving observed population diversity, migratory distance
from East Africa is a powerful predictor of population diversity across the globe, but not within continental regions
and thus, continental fixed e↵ects cannot be used in these instrumental variable regressions. Reassuringly, however,
the subsequent section establishes the causal e↵ect of population diversity while accounting for continental fixed
e↵ects.

3.2.3

Predicted Population Diversity and Jurisdictional Hierarchy

In light of potential concerns about the endogeneity of observed population diversity and the size
and the representativeness of the ethnic group sample with observed population diversity, the
third layer of this empirical analysis exploits an additional empirical strategy to identify the causal
e↵ect of population diversity on jurisdictional hierarchy and to demonstrate the robustness of the
estimated e↵ect. Using migratory distance from Africa to project population diversity for 1,267
ethnic groups in the Ethnographic Atlas, the analysis further establishes the robustness of the
highly significant e↵ect of population diversity on jurisdictional hierarchy in this extended sample.

16

Table 3 presents the results from OLS regressions of the log number of levels of jurisdictional
hierarchy in the pre-colonial era on predicted population diversity using the extended sample with
predicted genetic diversity. Reassuringly, in comparison to the estimates in Table 1 and Table
2, the estimated coefficients on predicted genetic diversity in Table 3 are of the same order of
magnitude and remain highly statistically significant. Furthermore, the estimates are very stable
across specifications.
Column 1 establishes that population diversity, as predicted by migratory distance from East
Africa, has a highly statistically and economically significant e↵ect on the log number of levels of
jurisdictional hierarchy. In particular, a 1 percentage point increase in the level of predicted population diversity increases the number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchy by 5.1 percent. Furthermore,
columns 2–6 establish that this e↵ect is robust to the inclusion of control variables capturing a range
of geographical factors. In particular, the estimated e↵ect of predicted genetic diversity on jurisdictional hierarchy remains highly significant while controlling for absolute latitude of the centroid
of the homeland of the ethnicity (column 2), soil quality decile fixed e↵ects (column 3), continental fixed e↵ects (column 4), elevation of the homelands, terrain ruggedness, length and density of
rivers, and the share of desert (column 5), average temperature, as well as the temperature range
(column 6).
Thus, Table 3 establishes that the estimated e↵ect of predicted population diversity on precolonial jurisdictional hierarchy is highly statistically and economically significant, accounting for a
wide range of potentially confounding geographical characteristics and continental fixed e↵ects. In
particular, the conditional e↵ect of a 1 percentage point increase in predicted population diversity
increases the number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchy by 5.9 percent. This partial association
between jurisdictional hierarchy and predicted population diversity, derived in column 6, is plotted
in Panel B of Figure A.1.
3.2.4

Robustness

The findings are una↵ected qualitatively by alternative geographical characteristic that has been
shown to be correlated with the emergence of the state in general and the presence of autocracy in
particular. First, as suggested by Bentzen et al. (2017) irrigation suitability, and its potential e↵ect
on the desirability of cooperation, is associated with the presence of autocracy across contemporary
countries and regions. As reported in Tables B.8 and B.9, irrigation suitability is also associated
with jurisdictional hierarchy across ethnic groups. Nevertheless, accounting for the potentially confounding e↵ect of irrigation suitability does not alter the qualitative impact of population diversity
on jurisdictional hierarchy in the predicted as well as the observed samples. Furthermore, in line
with the proposed hypothesis about the contribution of population diversity for the scope for domination, the interaction between genetic diversity and irrigation suitability is positive and highly
significant (Table B.10). Moreover, the association between irrigation suitability and jurisdictional
hierarchy becomes significantly positive only in sufficiently diverse societies.

17

Second, as suggested by Fenske (2014), ecological diversity is associated with jurisdictional
hierarchy. Nevertheless, accounting for the potentially confounding e↵ect of ecological diversity
does not alter the qualitative impact of population diversity on jurisdictional hierarchy in the
predicted as well as the observed samples (Tables B.11 and B.12). Third, as proposed by Mayshar
et al. (2015), the suitability of land for tubers is associated with jurisdictional hierarchy. Accounting
for the potentially confounding e↵ect of major crop types does not alter the qualitative impact of
population diversity on jurisdictional hierarchy in the predicted as well as the observed samples
(Tables B.13 and B.14).
The findings are robust to additional confounding geographical and ethnographic characteristics. First, variability of soil suitability that, as established by Michalopoulos (2012), contributes
to ethnolinguistic fractionalization and thus population diversity has no qualitative impact on the
findings (Tables B.15 and B.16). Second, while the scale of each society may be associated with
jurisdictional hierarchy, it has no qualitative impact on the e↵ect of population diversity on jurisdictional hierarchy (Tables B.17 and B.18). Third, the exclusion of the African continent has
no impact on the qualitative results (Tables B.19 and B.20). Fourth, the year of description of
each ethnic group, as recorded in the Ethnographic Atlas, has no qualitative impact on the findings
(Tables B.21 and B.22).
The findings are further robust to alternative specifications and estimation methods. In particular, the use of ordered probit rather than OLS has no impact on the results (Table B.5 and B.4),
and the analysis is una↵ected by the use of the number (rather than the logarithm of the number)
of levels of jurisdictional hierarchy as the outcome variable (Tables B.23 and B.24).

3.3

Population Diversity and Social Stratification Slavery

This subsection establishes the e↵ect of population diversity on the pre-colonial the degree of social
stratification and slavery across ethnic groups.
3.3.1

Observed Population Diversity and Social Stratification Slavery

The first layer of this empirical analysis establishes that ethnic groups that are characterized by a
higher level of observed population diversity tend to be characterized by a higher degree of social
stratification and by the presence of slavery.
Table 4 presents the results from OLS regression analyses of social stratification and slavery in
the pre-colonial era on observed population diversity. Consistent with the prediction of the proposed
hypothesis, columns 1–3 establish a highly statistically and economically significant correlation
between the measure of social stratification and observed genetic diversity, based on the 121 ethnic
groups for which information on both population diversity and social stratification are available.
Column 1 presents the correlation accounting for absolute latitude. Column 2 establishes that the
association remains highly statistically significant while accounting for the baseline geographical
controls, and column 3 establishes robustness of the association to the inclusion of continental fixed
e↵ects. The point estimate implies that a 1 percent increase in observed population diversity is

3.3.2

Observed Diversity and Social Stratification & Slavery: IV Analysis

In light of potential concerns about the endogeneity of observed population diversity, the second
layer of this empirical analysis exploits an instrumental variable strategy to identify the causal
e↵ect of population diversity on social stratification and slavery. In view of the negative e↵ect
of migratory distance from the cradle of humankind in East Africa to various settlements across
the globe on population diversity, migratory distance from Africa is exploited as an instrumental
variable for observed population diversity, establishing a highly significant causal e↵ect of diversity
on the degree of social stratification and slavery.
Table 5 presents the results from a series of 2SLS regressions. The table reveals that the e↵ect
of genetic diversity on social stratification and the intensity of slavery is statistically significant. In
particular, column 1 establishes that migratory distance from East Africa is a very strong instrument for genetic diversity (the Kleibergen-Paap F -statistic is 156) and that there is a statistically
and economically significant e↵ect of observed genetic diversity on social stratification, controlling
for absolute latitude. Furthermore, column 2 establishes that the order of magnitude and the significance of the estimate is robust to the inclusion of the baseline geographical controls. The point
estimate implies that a 1 percent increase in observed population diversity is associated with a 0.05
higher score on the social stratification scale.
Similarly, column 3 establishes that there is a highly statistically and economically significant
e↵ect of observed genetic diversity on the intensity of slavery, controlling for absolute latitude, while
column 4 establishes that the order of magnitude and the significance of the estimate is robust to
the inclusion of the baseline geographical controls. The point estimate implies that a 1 percent
increase in observed population diversity is associated with a 0.08 higher score on the intensity of
slavery scale.
3.3.3

and the representativeness of the ethnic group sample with observed population diversity, the third

of population diversity on social stratification and the degree of slavery and to demonstrate the
robustness of the estimated e↵ect. Using migratory distance from Africa to project population
diversity for 1,267 ethnic groups in the Ethnographic Atlas, the analysis further establishes the

It should be noted that the estimated e↵ect is much larger within continents compared to the estimated e↵ect
across the world as a whole.

Intensity of
Slavery

This table presents the results of a series of OLS regression analyses, on the ethnic-group level, of measures
of pre-colonial stratification and inequality on predicted genetic diversity, based on the migratory distance
from East Africa to the interior centroid of the homeland of the ethnicity, conditional on a range of control
variables at the ethnic-group level. Specifications marked with “Continental FE” accounts for sub-Saharan
Africa, Latin America, and continental fixed e↵ects. Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors are reported
in parentheses. *** Significant at the 1 percent level. ** Significant at the 5 percent level. * Significant at the
10 percent level.

1–3 establish that predicted population diversity has a highly statistically and economically significant e↵ect on the measure of social stratification. Column 1 presents the e↵ect accounting for
absolute latitude. Column 2 establishes that the point estimate is very similar and remains highly
significant in the presence of the baseline geographical control variables, and column 3 establishes
that the point estimate is of the same order of magnitude and remain highly significant as one
accounts for continental fixed e↵ects. This partial association between social stratification and
population diversity is plotted in Panel B of Figure A.2.
22

Similarly, columns 4 to 6 establish that predicted population diversity has a highly statistically
and economically significant e↵ect on the intensity of slavery. Column 5 establishes that the point
estimate is very similar and remains highly significant in the presence of the baseline controls.
Furthermore, column 6 establishes that the point estimate is nearly unchanged and remains highly
significant as one accounts for continental fixed e↵ects.
Thus, Table 6 establishes that the estimated e↵ect of predicted population diversity on precolonial social stratification and slavery is highly statistically and economically significant, accounting for a wide range of potentially confounding geographical characteristics and continental
fixed e↵ects. In particular, a 1 percentage point increase in predicted population diversity increases
the score on the social stratification index by 0.1 and the intensity of slavery index by 0.08.

Jurisdictional Hierarchy, Stratification, & Pre-Colonial Autocracy

This part of the pre-colonial ethnic-level empirical analysis explores the association between the
emergence of intuitions as well as the degree of social stratification with the emergence of precolonial autocratic institutions. In line with the proposed mechanism, the empirical analysis establishes that the number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchy and the degree of social stratification
and slavery are associated with the presence of pre-colonial autocratic institutions, as captured by:
(i) degree of absence of checks on leader’s power, (ii) difficulty of removal of leaders, (iii) leader’s
exercise of authority, (iv) degree of lack of community decisions, and (v) perception of leader’s
power. Moreover, the empirical analysis establishes the reduced form e↵ect of predicted population
diversity on each of these measures of pre-colonial autocracy.
3.4.1

Jurisdictional Hierarchy and Pre-Colonial Autocratic Institutions

The first layer of this empirical analysis establishes that the number of levels of jurisdictional
hierarchy is associated with the presence of pre-colonial autocratic institutions.
Table 7 presents the results from OLS regression analyses of the various measures of precolonial autocratic institutions on jurisdictional hierarchy.20 Columns 1 and 2 establish that precolonial jurisdictional hierarchy is highly significantly associated with the degree of absence of
checks on the leader’s power. Columns 3 and 4 suggest that pre-colonial jurisdictional hierarchy is
highly significantly associated with the difficulty of removal of leaders. Columns 5 and 6 find that
pre-colonial jurisdictional hierarchy is highly significantly associated with the leader’s exercise of
authority. Columns 7 and 8 establish that pre-colonial jurisdictional hierarchy is highly significantly
associated with the degree of lack of community decisions. Finally, columns 9 and 10 suggest that
pre-colonial jurisdictional hierarchy is highly significantly associated with the perception of the
leader’s power.

20

Given the limited number of observations in the SCCS-dataset, the analysis cannot account for continental fixed
e↵ects.

This table presents the results of a series of OLS regression analyses, on the ethnic-group level, of measures of pre-colonial autocracy on a measure of
pre-colonial jurisdictional hierarchy (the natural logarithm of the number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchy), conditional on a range of control variables at
the ethnic-group level. Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors are reported in parentheses. *** Significant at the 1 percent level. ** Significant at the
5 percent level. * Significant at the 10 percent level.

Thus, Table 7 establishes that jurisdictional hierarchy, as reflected by the number of levels of
jurisdictional hierarchy, is highly statistically significantly associated with the various measures of
pre-colonial autocratic institutions.
3.4.2

Stratification and Pre-Colonial Autocratic Institutions

The second layer of this empirical analysis establishes that the degree of social stratification and
slavery is associated with presence of pre-colonial autocratic institutions.
As presented in Table 8, social stratification is significantly associated with the degree of absence
of checks on the leader’s power (columns 1 and 2), and highly significantly associated with the
difficulty of removal of leaders (columns 3 and 4); the leader’s exercise of authority (columns 5 and
6); the degree of lack of community decisions (columns 7 and 8); the perception of the leader’s
power (columns and 10).
As presented in Table 9, the intensity of slavery is highly significantly associated with: the
degree of absence of checks on the leader’s power (columns 1 and 2); the difficulty of removal of
leaders (columns 3 and 4); the leader’s exercise of authority (columns 5 and 6); the degree of lack
of community decisions (columns 7 and 8); the perception of the leader’s power (columns and 10).
Thus, Table 8 and Table 9 establish that the associations between social stratification, the
intensity of slavery, and various measures of pre-colonial autocratic institutions are mostly highly
statistically significant.
3.4.3

Predicted Genetic Diversity and Pre-Colonial Autocracy

The third layer of this empirical analysis establishes that predicted population diversity has a
positive e↵ect on presence of pre-colonial autocratic institutions. Given the limited number of
observations in the SCCS-dataset, the analysis uses predicted diversity, rather than the observed
one.21
As reported in Table 10, predicted population diversity has a significant e↵ect on the degree
of absence of checks on the leader’s power (columns 1 and 2); the difficulty of removal of leaders
(columns 3 and 4); the leader’s exercise of authority (columns 5 and 6); the degree of lack of
community decisions (columns 7 and 8); the perception of the leader’s power (columns and 10).22
Overall, Table 10 establishes that predicted population diversity has significant e↵ects on the various
measures of pre-colonial autocratic institutions.

21

Table B.26 in the appendix establishes that observed population diversity is associated with pre-colonial autocracy if the measure of “Succession to the Office of Local Headman” from the Ethnographic Atlas is used to proxy for
pre-colonial autocracy.
22
It should be noted that the e↵ect of predicted population diversity on pre-colonial autocracy is not quadratic.
In particular, if predicted genetic diversity squared is included to the baseline specifications, the estimated coefficient
of this square term is insignificant in all specifications.

This table presents the results of a series of OLS regression analyses, on the ethnic-group level, of measures of pre-colonial autocracy on predicted genetic
diversity, based on the migratory distance from East Africa to the interior centroid of the homeland of the ethnicity, conditional on a range of control variables
at the ethnic-group level. Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors are reported in parentheses. *** Significant at the 1 percent level. ** Significant at
the 5 percent level. * Significant at the 10 percent level.

As reported in Table B.25, irrigation suitability is associated with some measures of autocracy
across ethnic groups. Nevertheless, accounting for the potentially confounding e↵ect of irrigation
suitability does not alter the qualitative impact of population diversity on autocracy.23
Hence, the findings establish the impact of predicted population diversity on the prevalence of
autocratic institutions, while indicating that this e↵ect could have plausibly operated through the
e↵ect of population diversity on the formation of institutions as well as stratification.

Roots of Autocracy in the Modern Era

This section explores the determinants of contemporary national institutions.24 It examines the
importance of the impact of population diversity on pre-colonial autocratic institutions across ethnic
groups for understanding the contemporary variation in autocratic institutions across nations, via
institutional persistence. Moreover, it analyzes the reduced-form relationship between population
diversity and the nature of contemporary national institutions.

Baseline Regression Specifications
Persistence of Autocracy

In estimating the persistence of institutions from the pre-colonial to the modern era, the following
empirical specification is adopted and estimated via ordinary least squares (OLS):
Am,i =

0

+

1 Ap,i

+ Xi0

2

+ Ci0

3

+ "i ,

(6)

where Am,i is a measure of modern autocracy for country i; Ap,i is a measure of pre-colonial
autocracy for country i; Xi is a vector of geographical control variables for country i; Ci is a vector
of continental dummies for country i; and "i is an country-specific error term.
4.1.2

Population Diversity and Modern Autocracy

In estimating the e↵ect of population diversity on contemporary institutions, the following empirical
specification is adopted and estimated via OLS:
Am,i =

0

1 Gm,i

0
+ Xm,i

2

+ Hi0

0
+ Cm,i

+ "i ,

(7)

where Gm,i is the predicted level of ancestry-adjusted genetic diversity for country i and Hi is a
vector of non-geographical control variables for country i.

23

Unlike the significant positive interaction between population diversity and irrigation suitability reported in
Tables B.9, B.8, and B.10, the interaction term here is insignificant, reflecting possibly the limited sample size.
24
The overall negative association between autocratic institutions and economic development is reflected in Figure
A.3 in the appendix.

4.2

Persistence of Autocracy

The first layer of the empirical analysis of the determinants of modern institutions establishes
the importance of the impact of population diversity on pre-colonial autocratic institutions across
ethnic groups for the understanding of the contemporary variation in autocratic institutions across
nations. In particular, it suggests that ethnic institutions that were formed in the pre-colonial era
persisted over time and are associated with contemporary national institutions.
Aggregating pre-colonial ethnic institutions into pre-colonial national institutions, based on the
average level of autocracy across ethnic-group homelands within each modern country, the analysis
suggests that indeed pre-colonial ethnic institutions have contributed to contemporary institutions,
beyond the persistent e↵ect geographical determinants. In particular, the degree of autocratic
institutions and the absence of executive constraints in the contemporary period are positively and
significantly associated with the degree of autocratic institutions in the pre-colonial era, accounting
for potentially confounding e↵ects of geographical characteristics and population diversity.
The presence of autocratic institutions in the pre-colonial era is captured by the degree of
absence of checks on leader’s power, as reported by the Standard Cross Cultural Survey, whereas
the degree of contemporary autocratic institutions is captured by the corresponding indexes of
“Constraints on the Executive” and “Autocracy” as reported by the Polity IV Project dataset.
In view of the cross continental migration in the post-1500 period and its potential e↵ects on
cross continental di↵usion of institutions as well as on changes in genetic diversity in the new
world, the analysis is restricted initially to the sample of Old World countries in order to properly
assess the presence of institutional persistence, and the role of geographical factors and population
diversity in this persistence.
Table 11 establishes the presence of institutional persistence in the sample of Old World countries. Column 1 establishes that, unconditionally, the pre-colonial degree of absence of checks on
leader’s power is negatively and highly significantly associated with the executive constraints in
the modern period. Column 2 suggests that the association established in column 1 is partly governed by geographical factors and their persistence over time, as reflected by the drop in the point
estimate of past autocracy on modern autocracy. Nevertheless, institutional persistence remains
significant at the 10% level. Furthermore, column 3 suggests that predicted population diversity
has a significant e↵ect on executive constraints in the modern period, and that the association
established in column 2 is partly governed by population diversity, as reflected by the additional
drop in the point estimate of past autocracy on modern autocracy. Nevertheless, institutional
persistence remains significant at the 10% level.
Similarly, column 4 establishes a highly significant negative unconditional association between
the pre-colonial degree of absence of checks on leader’s power and the index of autocracy for the
modern period. Moreover, column 5 suggests that the association established in column 4 is partly
governed by geographical factors and their persistence over time, as reflected by the drop in the point
estimate of past autocracy on modern autocracy. Nevertheless, institutional persistence remains
significant at the 1% level. Furthermore, column 6 suggests that predicted population diversity

established in column 5 is partly governed by population diversity, as reflected by the additional
drop in the point estimate of past autocracy on modern autocracy. Nevertheless, institutional
persistence remains significant at the 5% level.25 Moreover, as reported in Table B.27 in the
Appendix, institutional persistence is present in the global sample as well.26

4.3

Contemporary Population Diversity and Modern Autocracy

The second layer of the empirical analysis of the determinants of modern institutions explores the
contribution of modern population diversity to contemporary autocratic national institutions. It
examines whether population diversity at the national level, as captured by predicted population
diversity, has a significant e↵ect on the degree of autocracy and the absence of executive constraints
across countries, accounting for a large number of confounding geographical characteristics, regional
fixed e↵ects, colonial history (i.e., duration and colonizer nation), legal origins, pre-colonial development and the degree of ethnolinguistic fractionalization and its potential geographical origins.
The country-level analysis employs the measure of genetic diversity, as constructed by Ashraf
and Galor (2013), accounting for three important elements of population diversity with a national
population: the proportional representation of each ethnic group within the country, the expected
heterozygosity within each subnational group, as well as the diversity that arises from the genetic
distances between the pre-colonial ancestral populations.
4.3.1

Population Diversity and Constraint on the Executive

This subsection establishes that consistent with the proposed hypothesis population diversity at
the national level has a highly significant adverse e↵ect on the degree of executive constraints,
accounting for a large number of confounding factors.
As reported in Table 12, column 1 establishes based on data from 145 countries that, unconditionally, the level of predicted genetic diversity within a country in the modern era has a highly
significant negative e↵ect on the constraint on the chief executive.27 The estimated e↵ect indicates
that a 1 percentage point increase in predicted genetic diversity generates a 4.1 percent decrease in
the average level of the “Constraint on the Chief Executive” over the period 1994–2013.28 Columns
25

As established in Table B.28 in the appendix, these findings are robust to using indigenous autocracy, rather
than the degree of absence of checks on leader’s power, as a measure of autocracy across ethnic-group homelands
within modern country borders. Moreover, as shown in Table B.29 in the appendix, using a measure of indigenous
democracy derived from an alternative aggregation procedure from the ethnic group level to the country level, based
on Giuliano and Nunn (2013), produces similar results on a larger set of countries.
26
The e↵ect of population diversity on institutional persistence in this global sample is harder to assess due to the
fact that population diversity has changed in some countries over this time period, and the measures of population
diversity either in the pre-colonial period or in the modern period do not fully capture the dynamic of this variable
in the time period in between these two time points.
27
It should be noted that the e↵ect of predicted population diversity on autocracy in the modern era is not
quadratic. In particular, if predicted genetic diversity squared is included to the baseline specifications, the estimated
coefficient of this square term is insignificant in all specifications.
28
The examination of the e↵ect of genetic diversity on autocracy in earlier periods covered by the Polity IV data
set is not feasible since the data is available only for a small and selected group of countries whose institutions

32

2–4 establish that the e↵ect remains highly significant once additional confounding geographical
characteristics are accounted for. In addition, column 5 indicates that the negative e↵ect of predicted population diversity remains highly significant while accounting for continental fixed e↵ects,
capturing unobserved heterogeneity across continents. Reassuringly, as reported in columns 6 and
7, the e↵ect of genetic diversity on contemporary executive constraints is una↵ected by colonial
history and legal origins fixed e↵ects. This partial association between constraint on the executive
and population diversity, as derived in column 7, is plotted in Figure A.4.
Furthermore, Table B.30 in the appendix establishes that the findings in Table 12 are robust
to focusing on constraint on the executive in 2013. Moreover, accounting for the potentially confounding e↵ect of irrigation suitability does not alter the qualitative impact of population diversity
on autocracy (Table B.31).29 In addition, the findings are robust to the use of additional geographical controls, such as the percentage of land near a waterway (Table B.32), inequality of land
suitability (Table B.33), and percentages of population living in various climate zones (Table B.34).
Furthermore, they are robust to the inclusion of additional measures of colonial history, such as
colonizer nation (Table B.35) and colonial duration (Table B.36). Moreover, the findings are robust
to the inclusion of arguably endogenous controls, such as income per capita (Table B.37), years of
schooling (Table B.38), population density in 1500 (Table B.39), and social infrastructure (Table
B.40). Finally, the use of ethnolinguistic fractionalization as an alternative measure of population
diversity suggests that, while fractionalization has no e↵ect on executive constraints, the e↵ect of
genetic diversity remains nearly intact (Table B.41).
4.3.2

Population Diversity and Executive Constraints: IV Analysis

In light of the potential e↵ect on autocracy on population diversity via the cross-continental migration in the post-1500 era, the empirical analysis exploits an instrumental variable strategy to
identify the causal e↵ect of population diversity on constraints on the executives. In view of the
negative e↵ect of migratory distance from the cradle of humankind in East Africa to various settlements across the globe on population diversity, migratory distance from Africa is exploited as an
instrumental variable for population diversity.
The causal e↵ect of population diversity on the constraint on the executive is established in Table
13, which presents the estimation results from 2SLS regression analyses instrumenting population
diversity by the migratory distance from East Africa. Column 1 establishes that the level of
population diversity has a highly significant e↵ect on the constraint on the chief executive in 1994–
2013. Columns 2–4 establish that the e↵ect remains highly significant once additional confounding
geographical characteristics are accounted for. In addition, column 5 indicates that the negative
were sufficiently growth promoting so as to be included in the sample. In particular, those countries are generally
developed countries with less autocratic institutions today. Furthermore, the analysis based on the Ethnographic
Atlas provides captures some of this period since the description of ethnic groups in these sample is primarily based
on their characteristics around the turn to the 20th century.
29
Unlike the significant positive interaction between population diversity and irrigation suitability reported in
Tables B.9, B.8, and B.10, the interaction here is insignificant, reflecting possibly the limited sample size.

4.3.3

Population Diversity and Autocracy

This subsection establishes that consistent with the proposed hypothesis population diversity at
the national level has a highly significant adverse e↵ect on the index of autocracy, accounting for
a large number of confounding geographical characteristics, regional fixed e↵ects, colonial history,
legal origins, pre-colonial development and the degree of ethnolinguistic fractionalization and its potential geographical origins. Moreover, the e↵ect remains nearly intact if one accounts for arguably
endogenous controls such as income per capita and education.
As reported in Table 14, column 1 establishes based on data from 145 countries that, unconditionally, the level of predicted genetic diversity within a country in the modern era has a highly
significant negative e↵ect on the level of autocracy. The estimated e↵ect indicates that a 1 percentage point increase in predicted genetic diversity generates an 8.7 percent increase in the average
level of the autocracy measure over the period 1994–2013. Columns 2–4 establish that the e↵ect remains highly significant once additional confounding geographical characteristics are accounted for.
In addition, column 5 indicates that the negative e↵ect of predicted population diversity remains
highly significant while accounting for continental fixed e↵ects, capturing unobserved heterogeneity
across continents. Reassuringly, as reported in columns 6 and 7, the e↵ect of genetic diversity on
contemporary autocracy is una↵ected by colonial history and legal origins fixed e↵ects. This partial
association between constraint on the executive and population diversity, as derived in column 7,
is plotted in Figure A.5.
Furthermore, Table B.42 in the appendix establishes that the findings in Table 14 are robust
to focusing on constraint on the executive in 2013. Moreover, accounting for the potentially confounding e↵ect of irrigation suitability does not alter the qualitative impact of population diversity
on autocracy (Table B.43).30 In addition, the findings are robust to the use of additional geographical controls, such as the percentage of land near a waterway (Table B.44), inequality of land
suitability (Table B.45), and percentages of population living in various climate zones (Table B.46).
Furthermore, they are robust to the inclusion of additional measures of colonial history, such as
colonizer nation (Table B.47) and colonial duration (Table B.48). Moreover, the findings are robust
to the inclusion of arguably endogenous controls, such as income per capita (Table B.49), years of
schooling (Table B.50), population density in 1500 (Table B.51), and social infrastructure (Table
B.52). Finally, the use of ethnolinguistic fractionalization as an alternative measure of population

Population Diversity and Autocracy: IV Analysis

The causal e↵ect of population diversity on autocracy is established in Table 15, which presents
the estimation results from 2SLS regression analyses instrumenting predicted genetic diversity by
the migratory distance from East Africa. Column 1 establishes that the level of predicted genetic
diversity has a highly significant e↵ect on autocracy in 1994–2013. Columns 2–4 establish that
the e↵ect remains highly significant once additional confounding geographical characteristics are
accounted for. In addition, column 5 indicates that the negative e↵ect of predicted population
diversity remains highly significant while accounting for continental fixed e↵ects, capturing unobserved heterogeneity across continents. Reassuringly, as reported in columns 6 and 7, the e↵ect
of genetic diversity on contemporary autocracy is una↵ected by colonial history and legal origins
fixed e↵ects.
Thus, the second layer of the empirical analysis of the determinants of contemporary institutions
suggests that the spatial distribution of population diversity across the globe has also contributed
to contemporary variation in the degree of autocracy across countries. This reduced-form e↵ect of
population diversity on the prevalence of contemporary autocratic institutions across nations may
reflect either persistence of institutions from the pre-colonial to the modern era, as established in
the first layer of the analysis, or a direct e↵ect of population diversity on contemporary autocratic
institutions, capturing the e↵ect of diversity on the demand for institutions as well as for the scope
for domination.

Conclusion

This research explores the origins of the variation in the prevalence and nature of political institutions across the globe. It advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically that diversity across
human societies, as determined in the course of the exodus of Homo sapiens from Africa tens of
thousands of years ago, contributed to the formation of autocratic institutions across societies. The
study suggests that while population diversity has amplified the beneficial e↵ects of institutions
in mitigating the adverse e↵ects of non-cohesiveness on productivity, the contribution of diversity
to the range of cognitive and physical traits has fostered the scope for domination, leading to the
formation and persistence of institutions of the autocratic type.
The analysis suggests that diversity contributed to the emergence of autocratic pre-colonial
institutions. Moreover, the findings indicate that the impact of diversity on these institutions has
plausibly operated through its dual e↵ect on the formation of institutions as well as class stratification. Furthermore, reflecting the persistence of institutional, cultural, and human characteristics,
31

While the positive e↵ect of fractionalization on autocracy is significant in the absence of geographical controls, consistent with Aghion et al. (2004), once geographical controls are introduced only genetic diversity remains
significant.

the study suggests that the spatial distribution of population diversity across the globe has also
contributed to contemporary variation in the degree of autocracy across countries.

This table presents the results of a series of OLS regression analyses, on the ethnic-group level, of a measure of pre-colonial jurisdictional hierarchy
(the natural logarithm of the number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchy) on predicted genetic diversity, based on the migratory distance from East
Africa to the interior centroid of the homeland of the ethnicity, conditional on a range of control variables at the ethnic-group level. The table includes
bootstrapped standard errors that account for the uncertainty in the first stage of the prediction of genetic diversity based on the migratory distance
from East Africa. Furthermore, the table includes omitted variable statistics. Specifications marked with “Continental FE” accounts for sub-Saharan
Africa, Latin America, and continental fixed e↵ects. Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors are reported in parentheses. *** Significant at the 1
percent level. ** Significant at the 5 percent level. * Significant at the 10 percent level.

jurisdictional hierarchy (the natural logarithm of the number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchy) on predicted genetic
diversity, based on the migratory distance from East Africa to the interior centroid of the homeland of the ethnicity,
conditional on a range of control variables including a measure of irrigation potential at the ethnic-group level. The
irrigation measure is based on the “area equipped for irrigation” data of the Global Map of Irrigation Areas, version 5.0
(Siebert et al., 2013). Specifications marked with “Continental FE” accounts for sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and
continental fixed e↵ects. Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors are reported in parentheses. *** Significant at the

jurisdictional hierarchy (the natural logarithm of the number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchy) on observed genetic
diversity, conditional on a range of control variables including a measure of irrigation potential at the ethnic-group level.
The irrigation measure is based on the “area equipped for irrigation” data of the Global Map of Irrigation Areas, version
5.0 (Siebert et al., 2013). Specifications marked with “Continental FE” accounts for sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America,
and continental fixed e↵ects. Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors are reported in parentheses. *** Significant at
the 1 percent level. ** Significant at the 5 percent level. * Significant at the 10 percent level.

This table presents the results of a series of OLS regression analyses, on the ethnic-group level, of a measure of pre-colonial jurisdictional hierarchy
(the natural logarithm of the number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchy) on predicted genetic diversity, based on the migratory distance from East
Africa to the interior centroid of the homeland of the ethnicity, conditional on a range of control variables including a measure of irrigation potential,
as well as an interaction term between this measure and predicted genetic diversity, at the ethnic-group level. The irrigation measure is based
on the “area equipped for irrigation” data of the Global Map of Irrigation Areas, version 5.0 (Siebert et al., 2013). Heteroscedasticity-consistent
standard errors are reported in parentheses. *** Significant at the 1 percent level. ** Significant at the 5 percent level. * Significant at the 10

This table presents the results of a series of OLS regression analyses, on the ethnic-group level, of a
measure of pre-colonial jurisdictional hierarchy (the natural logarithm of the number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchy) on observed genetic diversity, conditional on a range of control variables and excluding
observations from Africa at the ethnic-group level. Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors are
reported in parentheses. *** Significant at the 1 percent level. ** Significant at the 5 percent level. *
Significant at the 10 percent level.

Given the low number of observations when excluding Africa and focusing on the sample of observed
genetic diversity, this robustness table is generated without inclusion of continental dummies. Table
B.19 establishes that the results are robust to accounting for continental fixed e↵ects when excluding
Africa in the larger sample of predicted genetic diversity.

This table presents the results of a series of OLS regression analyses, on the ethnic-group level, of measures of pre-colonial autocracy on predicted genetic diversity,
based on the migratory distance from East Africa to the interior centroid of the homeland of the ethnicity, conditional on a range of control variables at the ethnic-group
level including a measure of irrigation potential at the ethnic-group level. The irrigation measure is based on the “area equipped for irrigation” data of the Global Map
of Irrigation Areas, version 5.0 (Siebert et al., 2013). Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors are reported in parentheses. *** Significant at the 1 percent level.
** Significant at the 5 percent level. * Significant at the 10 percent level.

This table shows the robustness of the findings in Table 11 and B.28 to using a measure of indigenous
democracy (rather than indigenous autocracy) that is derived from an alternative aggregation
procedure from the ethnic group level to the country level, based on Giuliano and Nunn (2013) (see
Alesina et al. (2013) for an explanation of the methodology used in the construction of the data).
This procedure generates a larger sample of countries with aggregated institutional information.

This table presents the results of a series of 2SLS regression analyses, on the contemporary country level, of a measure of
contemporary autocracy on predicted genetic diversity, instrumented by the migratory distance from East Africa to the country,
conditional on a range of control variables. Specifications marked with “Continental FE” accounts for sub-Saharan Africa, Latin
America, and continental fixed e↵ects. Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors are reported in parentheses. *** Significant
at the 1 percent level. ** Significant at the 5 percent level. * Significant at the 10 percent level.

This table establishes that the findings in Table 12 are robust to accounting for the percentage of
land near a waterway.

conditional on a range of control variables. Specifications marked with “Continental FE” accounts for sub-Saharan Africa, Latin
America, and continental fixed e↵ects. Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors are reported in parentheses. *** Significant
at the 1 percent level. ** Significant at the 5 percent level. * Significant at the 10 percent level.

This table establishes that the findings in Table 12 are robust to accounting for mid-period income
per capita (i.e., income per capita in year 2000).

This table presents the results of a series of 2SLS regression analyses, on the contemporary country level, of a measure of
contemporary autocracy on predicted genetic diversity, instrumented by the migratory distance from East Africa to the country,
conditional on a range of control variables. Specifications marked with “Continental FE” accounts for sub-Saharan Africa, Latin
America, and continental fixed e↵ects. Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors are reported in parentheses. *** Significant
at the 1 percent level. ** Significant at the 5 percent level. * Significant at the 10 percent level.

This table establishes that the findings in Table 14 are robust to accounting for the percentage of

Definitions of main variables

This section describes the construction of the main variables.
Number of Levels of Jurisdictional Hierarchy
This variable is based on variable 33 in the Ethnographic Atlas, denoted “Jurisdictional
Hierarchy Beyond Local Community”. The Number of Levels of Jurisdictional Hierarchy
variable takes on the value 1 when the original variable indicates “No levels (no political
authority beyond community)”, 2 when it indicates “One levels (e.g., petty chiefdoms)”,
3 when it indicates “Two levels (e.g., larger chiefdoms)”, 4 when it indicates “Three levels
(e.g., states)”, 5 when it indicates “Four levels (e.g., large states)”.
Genetic Diversity
The data on observed genetic diversity on the ethnic group level comes from the newly
assembled data on observed genetic diversity in 232 worldwide (predominantly indigenous)
ethnic groups from Pemberton et al. (2013). The data on predicted genetic diversity on
the modern country level comes from (Ashraf and Galor, 2013).
Social Stratification
This variable is based on variable 66 in the Ethnographic Atlas, denoted “Class Stratification”. The Social Stratification variable takes on the value 0 when the original variable
indicates “Absence among freemen)”, 1 when it indicates “Wealth distinctions” or “Elite
(based on control of land or other resources”, and 2 when it indicates “Dual (hereditary
aristocracy)” or “Complex (social classes)”.
Intensity of Slavery
This variable is based on variable 66 in the Ethnographic Atlas, denoted “Type of Slavery”.
The Intensity of Slavery variable takes on the value 0 when the original variable indicates
“Absence or near absence”, 1 when it indicates “Incipient or nonhereditary” or “Reported
but type not identified”, and 2 when it indicates “Hereditary and socially significant”.
Indigenous Autocracy
This variable is based on variable 72 in the Ethnographic Atlas, denoted “Succession to
the Office of Local Headman”. The Indigenous Autocracy variable takes on the value 1
when the original variable indicates “Election or other formal consensus, nonhereditary”, 2
when it indicates “Informal consensus, nonhereditary”, and 3 when it indicates “Patrilineal
heir”, “Matrilineal heir”, “Appointment by higher authority, nonhereditary”, “Seniority or
age, nonhereditary”, “Influence, wealth or social status, nonhereditary”, or “Absence of
any such office”.

102

Executive Constraints
This variable come from the Polity IV Project dataset (Marshall et al., 2014). The variable
takes on an integer values from 1 to 7, indicating increasing extends of “institutionalized
constraints on the decision-making powers of chief executives, whether individuals or collectivities” (Marshall et al., 2014).
Autocracy
This variable come from the Polity IV Project dataset (Marshall et al., 2014). The variable
takes on the value 0 or an integer value from 1 to 10, indicating increasing extends of “the
presence of a distinctive set of political characteristics” characterizing autocracy. According
to the definition, in their mature form, “autocracies sharply restrict or suppress competitive
political participation” (Marshall et al., 2014).
Migratory Distance from East Africa
In estimating the migratory distance from Addis Ababa (East Africa) for each of the
ethnic groups in the data, the shortest traversable paths from Addis Ababa to the interior
centroid of each ethnic group was computed. Given the limited ability of humans to
travel across large bodies of water, the traversable area included bodies of water at a
distance of 100km from land mass (excluding migration from Africa into Europe via Italy
or Spain). Furthermore, for ethnicities that reside in a distance that exceed 100km from
the traversable area connected to Addis Ababa, the distance was computed in the following
way. A point set was created by clipping the extended traversable area to world boundaries
and aggregating it to a resolution of 2,096,707 pixels which was then converted into points.
For each ethnicity centroid, the nearest four distance points were identified and the great
circle distance from the ethnicity centroid to those points were calculated. These distances
was then added to the migratory distance from Addis Ababa at the distance point to obtain
the total migratory distance from the ethnicity centroid from Addis Ababa to each of these
four points. The point with the shortest total migratory distance from Addis Ababa was
selected to represent the total migratory distance for the ethnicity.
Control Variables
The control variables come from a range of sources. For the analysis of the pre-colonial
era, the developed geo-referenced dataset on within-ethnic-group genetic diversity and
ethnographic information contains a wide range of variables (see Ashraf et al., 2015, for
more information on the data). Since the data is partly based on Fenske (2013), it includes a
range of geographic variables derived by him, in addition to geographic variables derived by
the authors. These geographic variables include elevation, ruggedness, length and density
of rivers in the area, share of desert on the area, as well as the average climatic suitability
for agriculture (as constructed by Ramankutty et al. (2002) and also used by Michalopoulos
(2012)), average temperature, and average diurnal temperature range over the period 1901–
2012 as constructed by the Climate Research Unit (see Harris et al., 2014).
