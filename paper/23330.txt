ABSTRACT
In this paper, we show that labor-market adjustment to immigration differs across tradable and
nontradable occupations. Theoretically, we derive a simple condition under which the arrival of
foreign-born labor crowds native-born workers out of (or into) immigrant-intensive jobs, thus
lowering (or raising) relative wages in these occupations, and explain why this process differs
within tradable versus within nontradable activities. Using data for U.S. commuting zones over
the period 1980 to 2012, we find that consistent with our theory a local influx of immigrants
crowds out employment of native-born workers in more relative to less immigrant-intensive
nontradable jobs, but has no such effect within tradable occupations. Further analysis of
occupation labor payments is consistent with adjustment to immigration within tradables
occurring more through changes in output (versus changes in prices) when compared to
adjustment within nontradables, thus confirming our model’s theoretical mechanism. Our
empirical results are robust to alternative specifications, including using industry rather than
occupation variation. We then build on these insights to construct a quantitative framework to
evaluate the consequences of counterfactual changes in U.S. immigration.

Introduction

There is a large literature on the impact of international trade on wages, employment, and
other labor-market outcomes.1 By contrast, research on how trade conditions the adjustment
of labor markets to changes in factor supplies, including those induced by immigration, is
relatively sparse.2 One explanation for this asymmetry is that the mechanism classical trade
theory posits for how openness regulates such adjustment—most notably, the Rybcznkski
Theorem (Rybczynski, 1955) of the two-good, two-factor Heckscher-Ohlin model—lacks empirical support.3 The theorem’s counterfactural predictions that factor prices and industry
factor proportions are insensitive to changes in factor supplies, and that between-industry
factor movements are what deliver this insensitivity, help justify abstracting from trade when
studying how labor markets adjust to changes in factor availability.4
In this paper, we present theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to show that the
tradability of goods and services affects how local labor markets accomodate inflows of foreign
labor. We intend not to resuscitate the rigid logic of the Rybczynski Theorem, but rather
to introduce a more general framework in which variation in tradability across productive
activities generates smoother and more realistic mechanisms through which workers and
regions respond to changes in labor market conditions.
To motivate our analysis, consider an inflow of labor in the U.S. from Mexico. The literature would characterize the exposure of U.S. workers as varying across regions (e.g., Altonji
and Card, 1991; Card, 2001; Munshi, 2003), skill groups (e.g., Borjas, 2003; Ottaviano and
Peri, 2012), and (or) occupations (e.g., Friedberg, 2001; Ottaviano et al., 2013; Dustmann et
al., 2013). Given the labor forces of the two countries and historical migration patterns, we
would expect labor supplies in the U.S. to expand more for workers without a high-school
degree than for workers with a college education, more in cities with a long history of immigrant settlement such as Los Angeles than in nontraditional locales such as Pittsburgh, and
more in jobs that are relatively open to immigrants such housekeeping or textile-machine
operation than in those that attract few foreign-born workers such as firefighting.
To these standard sources of variation in worker exposure to immigration, we add variation in the tradability of goods and services, as in recent models of offshoring (Grossman and
Rossi-Hansberg, 2008). Although textile production and housekeeping are each activities intensive in immigrant labor, textile factories can absorb increased labor supplies by expanding
exports to other regions in a way that housekeepers cannot. More generally, we show that

See Hanson and Slaughter (2002) and Gandal et al. (2004) for evidence that economies do not absorb
labor inflows by shifting output toward labor-intensive industries and related analysis in Bernard et al.
(2013) on regional covariation in factor prices and factor supplies. Card and Lewis (2007), Lewis (2011),
and Dustmann and Glitz (2015) find that absorption of foreign labor occurs instead through within-industry
changes in factor intensities. See Gonzalez and Ortega (2011) for recent analysis in a line of work dating
back to Card (1990) on how sudden inflows of immigrant labor do not discernibly affect native wages and
employment. For contrasting results on immigration and industry size, see Bratsberg et al. (2017). Empirical
work squarely in the trade tradition, and in the spirit of Rybczynksi, examines how national factor supplies
affect national specialization patterns (Harrigan, 1995; Bernstein and Weinstein, 2002; Schott, 2003).

labor-market adjustment to immigration across tradable occupations differs from adjustment
across nontradable occupations. We derive a simple theoretical condition under which the
arrival of foreign-born labor crowds native-born workers into or out of immigrant-intensive
jobs and explain why this process differs within the sets of tradable and nontradable tasks.
Empirically, we find support for our model’s key implications using cross-region and crossoccupation variation in changes in labor allocations, total labor payments, and wages for the
U.S. between 1980 and 2012; while our focus is on occupations, our results also hold across
industries separated according to their tradability. We then incorporate these insights into
a quantitative framework to evaluate how immigration affects regional welfare.
Our model has three main ingredients. First, each occupation is produced using a combination of immigrant and native labor, where the two types of workers may differ in their
relative productivities across occupations and may be imperfectly substitutable within occupations.5 Second, heterogeneous workers select occupations as in Roy (1951), giving rise
to upward-sloping labor-supply curves.6 Third, the elasticity of demand facing a region’s
occupation output with respect to its local price differs endogenously between more- and
less-traded occupations. In this framework, the response of occupational wages and employment to an inflow of foreign-born labor depends on two elasticities: the elasticity of local
occupation output to local prices and the elasticity of substitution between native and immigrant labor within an occupation. When the first elasticity is low, crowding in occurs, as
in the classic Rybczynski (1955) effect. Because factor proportions within each occupation
are insensitive to changes in factor supplies, market clearing requires that factors reallocate
towards immigrant-intensive occupations. By contrast, a low elasticity of local occupation
output to local prices means that the ratio of outputs across occupations is relatively insensitive to changes in factor supplies. Now, factors reallocate away from immigrant-intensive
occupations, in which case foreign-born arrivals crowd the native-born out of these lines of
work. More generally, native-born workers are crowded out by an inflow of immigrants if
and only if the elasticity of substitution between native and immigrant labor within each
occupation is greater than the elasticity of local occupation output to local prices.7 Factor
reallocation, in turn, is linked to changes in occupational wages. Because each occupation
faces an upward-sloping labor-supply curve, crowding out (in) is accompanied by a decrease
(increase) in the wages of native workers in relatively immigrant-intensive jobs.
The tradability of output matters in our model because it shapes the elasticity of local
occupation output to local prices. The prices of more-traded occupations are (endogenously)
less sensitive to changes in local output. In response to an inflow of immigrants, the increase
in output of immigrant-intensive occupations is larger and the reduction in price is smaller
for tradable than for nontradable tasks. That is, adjustment to labor-supply shocks across
5

In our quantitative analysis, we estimate a high degree of native-immigrant substitutability within occupations, consistent with recent evidence on native-immigrant substitutability at an aggregate level (Ottaviano
and Peri, 2012; Borjas et al., 2012).
6
In marrying Roy with Eaton and Kortum (2002), our work relates to analyses on changes in labor-market
outcomes by gender and race (Hsieh et al., 2013), the role of agriculture in cross-country productivity differences (Lagakos and Waugh, 2013), the consequences of technological change for wage inequality (Burstein
et al., 2016), and regional adjustment to trade shocks (Caliendo et al., 2015; Galle et al., 2015).

The Rybczynski Theorem is a particular knife-edge case of our framework in which, amongst many other
restrictions, the elastcity of local occupation output to local prices is infinite.

tradable occupations occurs more through changes in output when compared to nontradables.8 The crowding-out effect of immigration on native-born workers, whatever its sign,
is systematically weaker in tradable than in nontradable jobs. Since factor reallocation and
wage changes are linked by upward-sloping occupational-labor-supply curves, an inflow of
immigrants causes wages of more immigrant-intensive occupations to fall by less (or to rise
by more) within tradable occupations than within nontradable occupations.
We provide empirical support for the adjustment mechanism in our model by estimating
the impact of increases in local immigrant labor supply on the local allocation of domestic
workers and payments to labor across occupations in the U.S. We instrument for immigrant
inflows into an occupation in a local labor market following Card (2001). Because we target adjustment across occupations within a region, we are able to control for regional time
trends and thus impose weaker identifying assumptions than in standard applications of the
Card approach. Using commuting zones to define local labor markets (Autor and Dorn,
2013), measures of occupational tradability from Blinder and Krueger (2013) and Goos et
al. (2014), and data from Ipums over 1980 to 2012, we find that a local influx of immigrants
crowds out employment of U.S. native-born workers in more relative to less immigrantintensive occupations within nontradables, but has no such effect within tradables. Stronger
immigrant crowding out in nontradables satisfies a central prediction of our model. We
confirm the mechanism behind this result—that adjustment within tradables occurs more
through changes in local output than through changes in local prices when compared to nontradables—by showing that in response to an immigrant inflow, occupation labor payments
(which we use to measure occupation revenue) expand more in more-immigrant-intensive
occupations within tradables as compared to within nontradables. Analysis of wage changes
in response to immigration—at the occupation level, at the region level, and between moreand less-educated workers—provides additional support for our model.
The empirical estimates guide the parameterization of an extended version of our model,
which incorporates multiple education groups and native labor mobility between regions,
building on recent literature in spatial economics (Allen and Arkolakis, 2014 and Redding
and Rossi-Hansberg, 2016). We use this model to characterize the full general-equilibrium
impacts of immigration. The two counterfactual exercises we consider are a reduction in
immigrants from Latin America, who tend to have relatively low education levels and to
cluster in specific U.S. regions, and an increase in the supply of high-skilled immigrants, who
tend to be more evenly distributed across space in the U.S. As expected, reducing immigration from Latin America increases the relative wage of low-education workers, and this
effect is larger in high-settlement cities such as Los Angeles than in low-settlement cities such
as Pittsburgh. More significantly, this shock raises wages for native-born workers in moreexposed nontradable occupations (e.g., housekeeping) relative to less-exposed nontradable
occupations (e.g., firefighting) by much more than for similarly differentially exposed tradable jobs (e.g., textile-machine operation versus computer and communications equipment
operation), a finding that captures the wage implications of differential immigrant crowding out of native-born workers within nontradables versus within tradables. Importantly,
reducing immigration raises the local price index, thereby lowering real wages for native8

This result is related to an idea discussed in the trade and wages literature of two decades ago, in which
greater openness to trade may make labor demand curves more elastic (Rodrik, 1997; Slaughter, 2001).

born workers, except those in the most immigrant-intensive nontraded occupations in the
most-exposed regions.9
Our second exercise clarifies how the geography of labor-supply shocks conditions the
nontradable-tradable contrast in labor-market adjustment. Because high-skilled immigrants
are not very concentrated geographically in the U.S. (compared to low-skilled immigrants),
increasing their numbers does not result in much variation in labor-supply changes across
regions. Adjustment is similar within the set of tradable and nontradables occupations, so
that the reduction of native wages in more exposed occupations is comparable within the two
sets of jobs. For the nontradable-tradable distinction in adjustment to be manifest, regional
labor markets must be differentially exposed to a particular shock.
Previous literature establishes that employment in tradable and nontradable industries
responds nonuniformly to local-labor-market shocks, such as the post-2007 U.S. housingmarket collapse (Mian and Sufi, 2014). On immigration, Dustmann and Glitz (2015) find
that regional wages are more responsive to local changes in immigrant labor supply in nontradable versus tradable industries and Peters (2017) finds that the manufacturing share of
employment rises in regions that are more exposed to the inflow of refugees in post-World
War II Germany. In contrasting results, Hong and McLaren (2015) find that immigrant
inflows in U.S. regional economies are associated with increases in total native employment,
with no consistent difference in response between more and less tradable industries. Our
analysis, while encompassing such between-sector variation in immigration impacts, introduces the new mechanism of differential adjustment within tradables when compared to
within nontradables. We thereby revive a generalized version of the Rybczynski effect for
the analysis of labor-market adjustment to external shocks.
Much previous work studies whether immigrant arrivals displace native-born workers
(Peri and Sparber, 2011a). Evidence of displacement effects is mixed. On the one hand,
higher-immigration regions do not have lower relative employment rates for native-born
workers (Card, 2005; Cortes, 2008). On the other hand, regions that have larger inflows
of low-skilled immigrants have lower relative prices for labor-intensive nontraded services
(Cortes, 2008), pay lower wages to low-skilled native-born workers in nontraded industries
(Dustmann and Glitz, 2015), and employ fewer native-born workers in labor-intensive occupations such as manicurist services (Federman et al., 2006) and construction (Bratsberg and
Raaum, 2012). Our analysis suggests that previous work, by imposing uniform adjustment
within tradable and within nontradable sectors, incompletely characterizes immigration displacement effects. The relaxed Rybczynski logic of our framework explicitly accounts for the
distinctive adjustment of nontraded occupations noted in this empirical literature.
In other related work, Peri and Sparber (2009) derive and estimate a closed-economy
model in which immigration pushes native-born workers into non-immigrant-intensive tasks
(i.e., crowding out), thereby mitigating the negative impact of immigration on native wages.
Ottaviano et al. (2013) study a partial equilibrium model in which firms in an industry may
hire native and immigrant labor domestically or offshore production to foreign labor located
abroad. Freer immigration reduces offshoring and has theoretically ambiguous impacts on
native-born employment, which in the empirics are found to be positive. Relative to the first
paper, our model allows for either crowding in or crowding out and we show theoretically,

empirically, and quantitatively how the strength of these effects differs within tradable versus
within nontradable occupations; relative to the second paper, our work derives the general
equilibrium conditions under which crowding in (out) occurs and shows how the responses
of native employment and wages differ for more and less tradable jobs.
Our analytic results on immigrant crowding out of native-born workers are parallel to
insights on capital deepening in Acemoglu and Guerrieri (2008) and on offshoring in Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008). The former paper, in addressing growth dynamics, derives
a condition for crowding in (out) of the labor-intensive sector in response to capital deepening
in a closed economy; the latter paper demonstrates that a reduction in offshoring costs has
both productivity and price effects, which are closely related to the forces behind crowding
in and crowding out, respectively, in our model. As we show below, the forces generating
crowding in within Acemoglu and Guerrieri (2008) and the productivity effect in Grossman
and Rossi-Hansberg (2008) are closely related to the Rybczynski theorem. Relative to these
papers, we provide more general conditions under which there is crowding in (out), show
that crowding out is weaker where local prices are less responsive to local output changes,
and prove that differential output tradability creates differential local price sensitivity.
Sections 2 and 3 outline our benchmark model and present comparative statics. Section 4
details our empirical approach and results on the impact of immigration on the reallocation
of native-born workers, changes in labor payments across occupations, and changes in wages
for native-born workers. Section 5 summarizes our quantitative framework and discusses
parameterization, while Section 6 presents results from counterfactual exercises in which we
examine the consequence of changes in immigration that mimic proposed changes in U.S.
immigration policy. Section 7 offers concluding remarks.

Model

The model that we present in this section combines three ingredients. First, following Roy
(1951) we allow for occupational selection by heterogeneous workers, inducing an upwardsloping labor supply curve to each occupation and differences in wages across occupations
within a region. Second, occupational tasks are tradable, as in Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg
(2008), and we incorporate variation across occupations in tradability, which induces occupational variation in price responsiveness to local output. Third, as in Ottaviano et al. (2013),
we allow for imperfect substitutability within occupations between immigrant and domestic
workers. We perform comparative statics first abstracting from trade between regions and
then under the assumption that each region is a small open economy.

2.1

Assumptions

There are a finite number of regions, indexed by r ∈ R. Within each region there is a
continuum of workers indexed by z ∈ Zr , each of whom inelastically supplies one unit of
labor. Workers may be immigrant (i.e, foreign born) or domestic (i.e., native born), indexed
by k = {I, D}. The set of type k workers within region r is given by Zrk , which has measure
Nrk . Each worker is employed in one of O occupations, indexed by o ∈ O. In Section 5 we
extend this model by dividing domestic and immigrant workers by education and allowing
5

for imperfect mobility of domestic workers across regions. The empirical analysis in Section
4 implicitly allows for the regional mobility of domestic workers, too.10

where Lkro is the efficiency units of type k workers employed in occupation o in region r, Akro
is the systematic component of productivity of any type k worker in this occupation and
region, and ρ > 0 is the elasticity of substitution between immigrant and domestic labor
within each occupation. In our analytic results, we assume that any changes in productivity
are Hicks-neutral (i.e., equal in percentage terms across factors and occupations). While the
literature has varying results on the substitutability of domestic and immigrant workers in the
aggregate (Borjas et al., 2012; Manacorda et al., 2012; Ottaviano and Peri, 2012), we focus on
substitutability within occupations. We use our reduced-form estimation results to discipline
the choice of ρ in our quantitative model (and find a high degree of substitutability). In
Appendix B, we present a production function in which output is produced using a continuum
of tasks and in each task domestic and immigrant labor are perfect substitutes up to a
task-specific productivity differential, such that immigrant and native workers endogenously
specialize in different tasks within occupations; this setting yields an identical system of
equilibrium conditions and highlights the flexibility of our approach.

Whereas in the model the supply of immigrant workers in a region is exogenous, in the empirical analysis
we treat it as endogenous; see Klein and Ventura (2009), Kennan (2013), di Giovanni et al. (2015), and
Desmet et al. (Forthcoming) for models of international migration based on cross-country wage differences.
In Appendix D we vary the model by allowing for an infinitely elastic supply of immigrants in each regionoccupation pair (which fixes their wage). We show that the implications of that model for occupation
wages of native workers and factor allocations in response to changes in the productivity of immigrants are
qualitatively the same as those in our baseline model for changes in the number of immigrants. We also use
this model to relate our results to those in Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008).

lative distribution function G (ε) = exp −ε
, where a higher value of θ > 0 decreases
the within-worker dispersion of efficiency units across occupations.11
The services of an occupation can be traded between regions subject to iceberg trade
costs, where τrjo ≥ 1 is the cost for shipments of occupation o from region r to region j
and we impose τrro = 1 for all regions r and occupations o. The quantity of occupation o
produced in region r must equal the sum of absorption (and trade costs) across destinations,

Although it plays little role in our analysis, we assume trade is balanced in each region.12
All markets are perfectly competitive, all factors are freely mobile across occupations,
and, for now, all factors are immobile across regions (an assumption we relax in Section 5).

2.2

Equilibrium characterization

We characterize the equilibrium under the assumption that Lkro > 0 for all occupations o
and worker types k, since our analytic results are derived under conditions such that this
assumption is satisfied. Final-good profit maximization in region r implies

The assumption of a Fréchet distribution is convenient to derive our analytic comparative statics and to
parameterize the model (since it only requires one parameter, shaping how occupation wages change with
occupation employment). As is true of any parametric assumption, it is not without loss of generality. Adao
(2016) presents a non-parametric approach to estimate the distribution of ε (z, o).
12
In the empirics, regional trade imbalances are absorbed by region fixed effects. In the quantitative
analysis, this assumption allows us to back out (unobserved) trade shares by region and occupation.

region-occupation ro and the resorting of workers across occupations in region r. In Section

In response to a decline in an occupation wage, a worker may switch occupations, thus mitigating the
potentially negative impact of immigration on wages, as in Peri and Sparber (2009). However, the envelope

effects on changes in individual wages, which solve maxo Wro

it also holds for the average wage across workers, as can be seen in equation (27).

Comparative statics

In this section we derive analytic results for changes in regional labor supply and show that
adjustment to labor supply shocks varies across occupations within regions. We examine the
impact of given infinitesimal changes in the population of different types of workers within a
given region, NrD and NrI , on occupation quantities and prices as well as factor allocation and
occupation wages. Lower case characters, x, denote the logarithmic change of any variable
X relative to its initial equilibrium level (e.g. nkr ≡ ∆ ln Nrk ).
To build intuition and identify how particular assumptions affect results, we start with
the special case of a closed economy in Section 3.1. We then generalize the results, first in
Section 3.2 by allowing for trade between regions under the assumption that each region
operates as a small open economy, and then in Section 3.3 by allowing immigration to affect
aggregate regional productivity. Derivations and proofs are in Appendix A.

3.1

Closed economy

In this section we assume that region r is autarkic: τrjo = ∞ for all j 6= r and o. We
describe the impact of a change in labor supply first on occupation output, prices, and labor

Ψr ≥ 0, an increase in the relative supply of immigrant workers in a region, nIr > nD

the relative wage of domestic workers in a region, w̃r ≥ 0, and makes all occupations more

across occupations, η, increases the size of relative output changes and decreases the size
of relative price changes. In response to an inflow of immigrants, nIr > nD
r , a higher value
of η generates a larger increase (or smaller decrease) in labor payments within immigrantintensive occupations, as we show in Appendix A.2.

By (15) and (16), an increase in the relative supply of immigrant workers, nIr > nD
r , decreases
employment of type k workers and (for any finite value of θ) occupation wages in the relatively
immigrant-intensive occupation if and only if η < ρ. If η < ρ, we have crowding out: an
10

inflow of immigrant workers into a region induces factor reallocation away from immigrantintensive occupations; if on the the other hand, η > ρ, we have crowding in: an immigrant
influx induces factors to move towards immigrant-intensive occupations.
The direction of labor reallocation between occupations is governed by the extent to
which immigration is accomodated by expanding production of immigrant-intensive occupations or by substituting away from native towards immigrant workers within each occupation.
To provide intuition, consider three special cases. First, in the limit as η → 0, output ratios across occupations are fixed. The only way to accommodate an increase in the supply
of immigrants is to increase the share of each factor employed in domestic-labor-intensive
occupations (while making each occupation more immigrant intensive). In this case, immigration induces crowding out. Second, in the limit as ρ → 0, factor intensities within
each occupation are fixed. The only way to accommodate immigration is to increase the
share of each factor employed in immigrant-intensive occupations (while disproportionately
increasing production of immigrant-intensive occupations). In this case, immigration induces
crowding in. Third, if η = ρ, the immigrant intensity of each occupation moves one-for-one
with the region’s aggregate ratio of immigrants to native workers. New immigrants are allocated proportionately across occupations whereas the allocation of native workers remains
unchanged.16 More generally, a lower value of η − ρ generates more crowding out of (or less
crowding into) immigrant-labor-intensive occupations in response to an increase in regional
immigrant labor supply.
Consider next changes in occupation wages. If θ → ∞, then all workers within each k
are identical and indifferent between employment in any occupation. In this knife-edge case,
labor reallocates across occupations without corresponding changes in relative occupation
wages within k (taking the limit of (15) and (16) as θ converges to infinity). The restriction
that θ → ∞ thus precludes studying the impact of immigration (or any other shock) on
the relative wage across occupations of domestic or foreign workers. For any finite value of
θ—i.e., anything short of pure worker homogeneity—changes in occupation wages vary across
occupations. It is precisely these changes in occupation wages that induce labor reallocation:
in order to induce workers to switch to occupation o′ from occupation o, the occupation
wage must increase in o′ relative to o, as shown in (16). Hence, factor reallocation translates
directly into changes in occupation wages. Specifically, if occupation o′ is immigrant intensive
I
I
relative to occupation o, Sro
′ > Sro , then an increase in the relative supply of immigrant labor
in region r decreases the occupation wage for domestic and immigrant labor in occupation
o′ relative to occupation o if and only if η < ρ.
Relation to the Rybczynski theorem. Our results on changes in occupation output and
prices and on factor reallocation strictly extend the Rybczynski (1955) theorem.17 In our
context, in which occupation services are produced using immigrant and domestic labor, the
theorem states that for any constant-returns-to-scale production function, if factor supply
curves to each occupation are infinitely elastic (θ → ∞ in our model and homogeneous labor
16

In Appendix A.2 we solve for the elasticity of factor intensities
within each occupation with respect to

I
D
I
changes in relative factor endowments, nD
ro − nro / nr − nr . Factor intensities are inelastic if and only
if η > ρ (and unit elastic if η = ρ). Moreover, a higher value of η decreases the responsiveness of domestic
relative to immigrant occupation wages, Ψr .
17
Also on relaxing the assumptions underlying Rybczynski, see Wood (2012), who uses a two-country,
two-factor, and two-sector model in which each country produces a differentiated variety within each sector.

in the Rybczynski theorem), there are two occupations (O = 2 in our model), and relative
occupation prices are fixed (η → ∞ in our closed-economy model and the assumption of
a small open economy that faces fixed output prices in the Rybczynski theorem), then an
increase in the relative supply of immigrant labor causes a disproportionate “increase” in
the output of the occupation that is intensive in immigrant labor and a disproportionate

“decrease” in the output of the other occupation. Specifically, if Sr1

factor endowments, and factor-price insensitivity obtains (Feenstra, 2015). Hence, the only
way to accommodate an increase in the supply of immigrants is to increase the share of each
factor employed in the immigrant-intensive occupation. Taking the limit of equation (15) as
θ and η both converge to infinity and assuming that O = 2, we obtain

Rybczynski theorem and its corollary. As we show in Appendix C, in a special case of our
model that is, nevertheless, more general than the assumptions of the Rybczynski Theorem,
we obtain a simplified version of our extended Rybczynski theorem above—immigration induces crowding in or crowding out depending on a simple comparison of local elasticities—in
the absence of specific functional forms for production functions. Hence, our result extends
the Rybczynski theorem under strong restrictions in our model.18

3.2

Small open economy

We extend the analysis by allowing region r to trade. To make progress analytically, we
impose two restrictions. We assume that region r is a small open economy, in the sense that
it constitutes a negligible share of exports and absorption in each occupation for each region
j 6= r, and we assume that occupations are grouped into two sets, O (g) for g = {T, N}, where
region r’s export share of occupation output and import share of occupation absorption are
common across all occupations in the set O (g).19 We refer to N as the set of occupations
that produce nontraded services and T as the set of occupations that produce traded services;
all that is required for our analysis is that the latter is more tradable than the former.
18

Acemoglu and Guerrieri (2008) assume that factor supply curves to each occupation are infinitely elastic
(θ → ∞ in our model), there are two occupations (O = 2 in our model), and the elasticity of substitution
between factors is one (ρ = 1 in our model). They show that there is crowding in if η > 1 and crowding out
if η < 1. In Appendix D, we relate our framework and results to Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008).
19
Our results hold with an arbitrary number of sets. In the empirical analysis, we alter the effective
number of sets by varying the size of occupations of intermediate tradability which are excluded from the
analysis (from zero to one-fifth of the total number of categories). See the Appendix F.

12

The small-open-economy assumption implies that, in response to a shock in region r only,
prices and output elsewhere are unaffected in all occupations: pyjo = pjo = pj = yj = 0 for all
j 6= r and o. As we show in Appendix A.3, in this case the elasticity of region r’s occupation
o output to its price—an elasticity we denote by ǫro —is a weighted average of the elasticity of
substitution across occupations, η, and the elasticity across origins, α > η, where the weight
on the latter is increasing in the extent to which the services of an occupation are traded,
as measured by the export share of occupation output and the import share of occupation
absorption in region r. Therefore, more traded occupations feature higher elasticities of
regional output to price (and lower sensitivities of regional price to regional output).
The assumption that the export share of occupation output and the import share of
occupation absorption are each common across all occupations in O (g) in region r implies
that the elasticity of regional output to the regional producer price, ǫro , is common across
all occupations in O (g).20 In a mild abuse of notation, we denote by ǫrg the elasticity of
regional output to the regional producer price for all o ∈ O (g), for g = {T, N}.
Infinitesimal changes in aggregate labor supplies NrD and NrI generate changes in occupation outputs, output prices, labor payments, factor allocations, and wages across pairs of
occupations that are either in the set T or in the set N (i.e. o, o′ ∈ O (g)), which are given
by equations (12), (13), (14), (15) and (16) except now η is replaced by ǫrg .

wro . However, we assume that conditions on parameters satisfy the following version of the
law of demand: nIr ≥ nD
r implies w̃r ≥ 0. The results comparing changes in occupation
output and prices across any two occupations obtained in Section 3.1 now hold for any two
occupations within the same set: an increase in the relative supply of immigrant workers,
nIr > nD
r , increases the relative output and decreases the relative price of immigrant-intensive
occupations. Moreover, we can compare the differential output and price responses of more
to less immigrant-intensive occupations within T and N. Because ǫrT > ǫrN , the relative
output of immigrant-intensive occupations increases relatively more within T than within
N, whereas the relative price of immigrant-intensive occupations decreases relatively less in
T than in N. Similarly, if o, o′ ∈ O (g), then changes in relative labor payments are given by

By assuming that export shares in region r are common across all occupations in O (g), we are assumI
ing that variation in immigrant intensity, Sro

differently—in terms of quantities, prices, and employment— to a region r shock.

relatively more within T than within N in response to an inflow of immigrants.

The results comparing changes in allocations across any two occupations obtained in Section
3.1 now hold for any two occupations within the same set: for a given elasticity between
domestic and immigrant labor, ρ, the lower is the elasticity of regional output to the regional
producer price, ǫrg , the more that a positive immigrant labor supply shock causes workers to
crowd out of (equivalently, the less it causes workers to crowd into) occupations that are more
immigrant intensive. Because ǫrT > ǫrN , we can compare the differential response of more to
less immigrant-intensive occupations in T and N: within T , immigration causes less crowding
out of (or more crowding into) occupations that are more immigrant intensive (compared to
the effect within N). The intuition for the pattern and extent of factor reallocation between
any two occupations within a given set g = T or g = N is exactly the same as described in
the closed economy presented in Section 3.1. On the other hand, the pattern and extent of
factor reallocation between T and N depend on the full set of model parameters.21
Similarly, the result comparing changes in wages (for continuing workers) across two
occupations obtained in Section 3.1 now holds for any two occupations within the same set.
Because ǫrT > ǫrN , we can compare the differential response of more to less immigrantintensive occupations in T and N: within traded occupations T , immigration decreases
occupation wages less (or increases occupation wages more) in occupations that are more
immigrant intensive (compared to the effect within nontraded occupations N).

3.3

Aggregate productivity

Immigration may also affect aggregate regional productivity. For example, an increase in
immigrants could result in local congestion externalities (e.g., Saiz, 2007), thereby reducing
productivity, or local agglomeration externalities (e.g., Kerr and Lincoln, 2010), thereby
increasing productivity.22 Because the results in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 are proven allowing
for arbitrary values of ar , changes in regional productivity do not qualitatively affect the
relative outcomes within a region studied above.23
Of course, changes in regional productivity do shape regional outcomes. In two specifications of our model, it is straightforward to characterize the aggregate implications of changes
21

Comparisons between T and N have been the focus on previous empirical work, as described in our
Introduction.
22
Peters (2017) shows that post-war refugee inflows in Western Germany increased local productivity.
23
A similar logic applies to incorporating non-labor factors in the occupation production function. If our
labor aggregate and these factors are combined in a Cobb-Douglas aggregator with common shares across
occupations, changes in the supplies of these factors have the same effect as changes in aggregate productivity.

14

in aggregate productivity within region r: (i) if region r is autarkic, or (ii) if region r is a
small open economy and α = ∞ (i.e., for any occupation, the services from all origins are
perfect substitutes). In either case, resulting changes in equilibrium prices and quantities
k
satisfy the following conditions: nkro = pyro = pro = w̃r = 0 and wro
= qro = yr = ar . Labor allocations and relative occupation wages, prices, and quantities are all unaffected by
a change in aggregate productivity, whereas the real wage, output, and absorption in each
occupation move one-for-one with changes in aggregate productivity. Hence, although the
effects of immigration on the real wage and aggregate output in a given region are sensitive
to the impact of immigration on aggregate productivity, the effects of immigration on the
allocation of labor as well as on relative changes across occupations in wages, prices, and
quantities in a given region are not. We parameterize the relationship between regional
productivity and population in our extended model in Section 5.

Empirical Analysis

Guided by our theoretical model, we aim to study the impact of immigration on labor market
outcomes at the occupation level in U.S. regional economies. We begin by showing how to
convert our analytical results on labor market adjustment to immigration into estimating
equations. We then turn to an instrumentation strategy for changes in immigrant labor
supply, discussion of data used in the analysis, and presentation of our empirical findings.
Our analytical results include predictions for how occupational labor allocations, total
labor payments, and wages adjust to immigration. As discussed in Section 2.2, measuring
changes in occupation-level wages is difficult because changes in observable worker wages
reflect both changes in occupation wages and self-selection of workers across occupations
according to unobserved worker productivity. Correspondingly, we begin this section with
the more straightforward analysis of estimating the impact of immigration on occupational
labor allocations and total labor payments and then address wage impacts.

4.1

Specifications for Labor Allocations and Labor Payments

Equation (18) provides a strategy for estimating the impact of immigration on the allocation
of native-born workers across occupations. It can be rewritten as
D
nD
ro = αrg +

θ+1
I
(ǫrg − ρ) w̃r Sro
for all o ∈ O (g) ,
ǫrg + θ

D
where αrg
is a fixed effect specific to region r and the group (i.e., tradable, nontradable) to
which occupation o belongs. If the only shock in region r between time t0 and t1 > t0 is to
the supply of immigrants, then w̃r = ψr nIr , where ψr > 0 by our assumption that parameters
satisfy the law of demand. Hence, we have
D
nD
ro = αrg +

θ+1
I
(ǫrg − ρ) ψr nIr Sro
for all o ∈ O (g) .
ǫrg + θ

This can be expressed more compactly as
D
D
D
nD
ro = αrg + βr xro + βN r Io (N) xro ,

(20)
15

I I
where xro = Sro
nr is the immigration shock to occupation o in region r (i.e., the immigrant
cost share of occupation o at time t0 times the percentage change in the supply of immigrant
workers in region r) and Io (N) equals one if occupation o is nontradable..24
A value of βrD < 0 in equation (20) would imply crowding out of native-born workers
by immigrant labor in tradables: in response to an inflow of immigrants into region r,
native-born employment in tradable occupations with higher immigrant cost shares contracts
relative to those with lower immigrant cost shares. In the model of Section 3.2, βrD < 0 if
and only if ǫrT < ρ (the price elasticity of regional output in tradables is less than the
elasticity of substitution between native- and foreign-born labor within occupations). A
D
value of βrD + βN
r < 0 would imply crowding out in nontradables, which in our model occurs
if and only if ǫrN < ρ (where ǫrN is the price elasticity of regional output in nontradables).
D
Finally, a value of βN
r < 0 implies that crowding out is stronger in nontradables than in
tradables: in response to an inflow of immigrants, native-born employment in nontradables
contracts more (or expands less) in occupations with high relative to low immigrant cost
D
shares compared to tradables. In Section 3.2, βN
r < 0 if and only if ǫrT > ǫrN (the price
elasticity of regional output is higher in tradable than in nontradable occupations).
Equation (17) generates the corresponding specification for occupation labor payments,

lpro = αrg + γ r xro + γN r Io (N) xro ,

(21)

where the left-hand side of (21) is the log change in total labor payments for occupation o
in region r and and αrg is a fixed effect specific to region r and the group (i.e., tradable,
nontradable) to which occupation o belongs. From section 3.2, we know that a value of
γr > 0 in (21) implies that ǫrT > 1, a value of γr + γN r > 0 implies that ǫrN > 1, and a value
of γN r < 0 implies that ǫrT > ǫrN , which provides an additional test of the hypothesis that
crowding out is stronger in nontradables than in tradables.25
To apply (20) and (21) empirically, we must address several issues that are suppressed in
the theory but likely to matter in estimation. By abstracting away from observable differences
in worker skill, we have assumed in the model that all workers, regardless of education level,
draw their occupational productivities from the same distribution within each k = D, I.
To allow the distribution of worker productivities across occupations to be differentiated by
the level of schooling, we estimate (20) by education group (while estimating (21) for all
education groups combined, consistent with that equation’s connection to occupation total
revenues). Relatedly, changes over time in the educational attainment of immigrant workers
may change the profile of immigrant comparative advantage across occupations within a
region. We thus define the immigration shock xro expansively as
xro ≡

X
e

I
Sreo

I
∆Nre
,
I
Nre

(22)

24

As we discuss in Appendix J, a logic similar to that underlying (20) applies to how an immigrant inflow
affects the allocation of foreign-born workers across occupations. In Appendix J, we present results on the
immigrant-employment allocation regressions that are the counterparts to (23) and Table 1 below.
25
In our model the labor share of revenue within each occupation is assumed to be fixed (and equal to
one). The empirical relationship discussed above holds as long as changes in the occupation labor share
are uncorrelated with xro (conditional on covariates), as would be the case if the production function is
Cobb-Douglas between our labor aggregate and other inputs, as discussed in footnote 23.

16

I
where Nre
is the population of immigrants with education e within region r in period t0 ,
I
I
∆Nre
is the change in this population between t0 and t1 , and Sreo
is the share of total labor
payments in occupation o and region r that goes to immigrants with education e in period
t0 .26 In (22), we apportion immigrant flows into a region to occupations according to the
education-group-specific change in immigrant labor supplies and the education-group- and
occupation-group-specific cost shares for immigrants in the initial time period t0 .27
Summarizing the above discussion, regression specifications for changes in native-born
employment and total labor payments derived from our analytical results take the form
D
D
D
D
D
nD
ro = αrg + αo + β xro + βN Io (N) xro + νro ,

(23)

lpro = αrg + αo + γxro + γN Io (N) xro + νro ,

(24)

where nD
ro is the log change in employment for native-born workers (disaggregated by education group) for occupation o in region r, lpro is the log change in labor payments for
occupation o in region r (across all education groups and including both foreign- and nativeborn workers), we define xro using (22), and we incorporate occupation fixed effects, αoD and
αo , to absorb changes in labor market outcomes that are specific to occupations and common
across regions (due, e.g., to economy-wide changes in technology or demand).28 In (23) and
D
(24) we impose common impact coefficients β D , βN
, γ, and γN , such that the estimates of
D
these values are averages of their corresponding region-specific values (βrD , βN
r , γ, γN ) in
(20) and (21). When estimating (23) and (24), we weight by the number of native-born
workers employed or total labor payments within r, o in period t0 .
The regression in (23) allows us to estimate whether immigrant flows into a region induce
on average crowding out or crowding in of domestic workers in relatively immigrant-intensive
occupations separately within tradable and within nontradable occupations. It also allows
us to test whether crowding-out is weaker (or crowding-in is stronger) in tradable relative to
nontradable jobs. The regression in (24) allows us to estimate whether immigrant flows into
a region induce on average an increase or decrease in labor payments in relatively immigrantintensive occupations separately within tradable and within nontradable occupations. This
allows us to test the mechanism in our model that generates differential crowding out within
tradable and nontradable occupations, which is that quantities are more responsive and
prices less responsive to local factor supply shocks in tradable than nontradable activities.

4.2

An instrumental variables approach

In the theory, we treat immigrant inflows into a region as an exogenous event. In the
estimation, unobserved shocks to productivity or demand may affect both the employment
and wages of native-born workers and the attractiveness of a region to immigrant labor.
I I
With only one education group, the only difference between Sro
nr and xro is the use of log changes
versus percentage changes, which makes little difference for our results.
27
Consistent with Peri and Sparber (2011b) and Dustmann et al. (2013), we allow foreign- and native-born
workers with similar education levels to differ in how they match to occupations.
28
Since the immigration shock in (22) is normalized by initial population levels (and not current values),
the specification in (23) avoids concerns over division bias (Peri and Sparber, 2011a). And since we estimate
(23) by education group, the occupation fixed effects control for national changes in the demand for skill
that vary across occupations (due, e.g., to occupation-specific changes in preferences or technology).
26

17

Consider region r that attracts high-education immigrants between periods t0 and t1 . This
region will have a higher value of xro , especially in occupations that are intensive in higheducation immigrants. The inflow of high-education immigrants may have been induced
in part by region-and-occupation-specific demand or productivity shocks, implying that xro

may be correlated with νro
in (23) and with νro in (24). Measurement error in xro may also
be an issue, given small sample sizes for workers in some occupation-region cells.
To identify the causal impact of immigrant inflows to a region on native outcomes, we
follow Altonji and Card (1991) and Card (2001) and instrument for xro using

Here, ∆Nes
is the net immigrant inflow in the U.S. (excluding region r) from immigrantsource-region s and with education e between t0 and t1 , and fres is the share of immigrants
from source s with education e who lived in region r in period t0 .29 We allow immigrants
with different education and sources to vary in their spatial allocation, and allow immigrants
with different education levels within a region to vary in their occupational allocation.
The Card instrument, while widely used, is subject to criticism. One is that it may be
invalid if regional labor-demand shocks persist over time (Borjas et al., 1997). Helpfully, this
concern is less pressing in our context. In (23) and (24) we identify the parameters β, βN ,
γ, and γN using variation across occupations within regions in the change in employment or
D
labor payments. By including region-group fixed effects (αrg
, αrg ) in regressions in which
the dependent variable is a long-period change, we control for time trends that are specific
both to the region (r) and to tradable or nontradable occupations as a group (g). Our
analysis is thereby immune to region, occupation-group specific innovations that may drive
immigration, such as long-run shocks to aggregate regional productivity or amenities.30

4.3

Data

In our baseline analysis, we study changes in labor-market outcomes between 1980 and 2012.
In sensitivity analysis, we use 1990 and 2007 as alternative start and end years, respectively.
29

Regarding measurement error, small cell sizes in Ipums data may imply that the immigrant cost share
used to construct xro may be subject to sampling variation. In Appendix F, we report results using
I
values of Sreo
averaged over the initial sample year (1980) and the preceding time period (1970), to help
attenuate classical measurement error. The coefficient estimates are very similar to our main results.

D
A remaining concern is possible correlation between innovations to employment or labor payments (νro
,
I
νro ) and the initial share of immigrants in region-occupation labor payments (Sreo ), which is used in the
instrument in (25) and which may occur if the region-occupations that experience larger subsequent native
employment growth are ones in which immigrants were initially more concentrated. To address this threat

to identification, in Appendix F we construct the instrument in (25) by replacing Sreo
with S−reo

is the share of immigrant workers in labor payments for occupation o and education group e in the U.S.,
excluding region r. Results again are qualitatively similar to those we report below.

All data, except for occupation tradability, come from the Integrated Public Use Micro
Samples (Ipums; Ruggles et al., 2015). For 1980 and 1990, we use 5% Census samples; for
2012, we use the combined 2011, 2012, and 2013 1% American Community Survey samples.
Our sample includes individuals who were between ages 16 and 64 in the year preceding
the survey. Residents of group quarters are dropped. Our concept of local labor markets
is commuting zones (CZs), as developed by Tolbert and Sizer (1996) and applied by Autor
and Dorn (2013). Each CZ is a cluster of counties characterized by strong commuting ties
within and weak commuting ties across zones. There are 722 CZs in the mainland U.S.
For our first dependent variable, the log change in native-born employment for an occupation in a CZ shown in (23), we consider two education groups: high-education workers are
those with a college degree (or four years of college) or more, whereas low-education workers
are those without a college degree. These education groups may seem rather aggregate.
However, note that in (23) the unit of observation is the region and occupation, where our
50 occupational groups already entail considerable skill-level specificity (e.g., computer scientists versus textile-machine operators).31 We measure domestic employment as total hours
worked by native-born individuals in full-time-equivalent units (for an education group in an
occupation in a CZ) and use the log change in this value as our first regressand. We measure
our second dependent variable, the change in total labor payments, as the log change in total
wages and salaries in an occupation in a commuting zone.
We define immigrants as those born outside of the U.S. and not born to U.S. citizens.
The aggregate share of immigrants in hours worked in our sample rises from 6.6% in 1980 to
16.8% in 2012.32 We construct the occupation-and-CZ-specific immigration shock in (23) and
(24), xro , defined in (22), as the percentage growth in the number of working-age immigrants
for an education group in CZ r times the initial-period share of foreign-born workers in that
education group in total earnings for occupation o in CZ r, where this product is then
summed over education groups. In constructing our instrument shown in equation (25), we
consider three education groups and 12 source regions for immigrants.33
Our baseline data include 50 occupations (see Table 7 in Appendix E).34 We measure
31

We simplify the analysis by including two education groups of native-born workers. Because the divide in
occupational sorting is sharpest between college-educated and all other workers, we include the some-college
group with lower-education workers. Whereas workers with a high-school education or less tend to work in
similar occupations, the some-college group may seem overly skilled to fit in this category. Results are very
similar if we exclude some-college workers from the low-education group.
32
Because we use data from the Census and ACS (which seek to be representative of the entire resident
population, whether in the U.S. legally or not), undocumented immigrants will be included to the extent
that are captured by these surveys. An additional concern is that the matching of immigrants to occupations
may differ for individuals who arrived in the U.S. as children (and attended U.S. schools) and those who
arrived in the U.S. as adults. In Appendix F, we report results limiting immigrants to those who arrived in
the U.S. at age 18 or above. Our results are substantially unchanged.
33
The education groups are less than a high-school education, high-school graduates and those with some
college, and college graduates. Relative to native-born workers, we create a third education category of lessthan-high-school completed for foreign-born workers, given the preponderance of undocumented immigrants
in this group (and the much larger proportional size of the less-than-high-school educated among immigrants
relative to natives). The source regions for immigrants are Africa, Canada, Central and South America,
China, Eastern Europe and Russia, India, Mexico, East Asia (excluding China), Middle East and South and
Southeast Asia (excluding India), Oceania, Western Europe, and all other countries.
34
We begin with the 69 occupations from the 1990 Census occupational classification system and aggre-

19

occupation tradability using the Blinder and Krueger (2013) measure of “offshorability,”
which is based on professional coders’ assessments of the ease with which each occupation
could be offshored. Goos et al. (2014) provide evidence supporting this measure. They
construct an index of actual offshoring by occupation using the European Restructuring
Monitor and find that it is strongly and positively correlated with the Blinder-Krueger
measure.35 We group occupations into more and less tradable categories using the median
so that there are 25 tradable and 25 nontradable entries (see Table 8 in Appendix E). The
most tradable occupations include fabricators, financial-record processors, mathematicians
and computer scientists, and textile-machine operators; the least tradable include firefighters,
health assessors, therapists, and vehicle mechanics.
In Table 9 in Appendix E, we compare the characteristics of workers employed in tradable and nontradable occupations. Whereas the two groups are similar in terms of the
shares of employment of workers with a college education, by age and racial group, and
in communication-intensive occupations, tradable occupations have relatively high shares of
employment of male workers and workers in routine- and abstract-reasoning-intensive jobs.
High male and routine-task intensity arise because tradable occupations are strongly overrepresented in manufacturing. In robustness checks, we use alternative cutoffs for tradables
and nontradables; drop workers in agriculture, manufacturing, mining; and drop workers in
routine-task-intensive jobs. In further robustness checks, we use industries in place of occupations and measure industry tradability using three approaches, including that in Mian
and Sufi (2014).
Our analysis of changes in wages requires measures of wages by occupation, education
group, and CZ. To obtain these, we first regress log hourly earnings of native-born workers in
each year on a gender dummy, a race dummy, a categorical variable for 10 levels of education
attainment, a quartic in years of potential experience, and all pair-wise interactions of these
values (where regressions are weighted by annual hours worked times the sampling weight).
We take the residuals from this Mincerian regression and calculate the sampling weight and
hours-weighted average value for native-born workers for an education group in a CZ (or for
an occupation-education group in a CZ). Finally, we use these values to calculate changes in
education-level wages in each CZ (or in each occupation-CZ).

4.4

Empirical Results on Labor Allocations and Labor Payments

The specification for the impact of immigration on the allocation of native-born workers
across occupations within CZs is given in (23). We run all regressions separately for the
low-education group (some college or less) and the high-education group (college education
or more). The dependent variable is the log change in CZ employment (hours worked) of
native-born workers in an occupation and the independent variables are the CZ immigration
shock to the occupation, shown in (22), this value interacted with a dummy for whether
gate up to 50 to concord to David Dorn’s categorization (http://www.ddorn.net/) and to combine small
occupations that are similar in education profile and tradability but whose size complicates measurement.
35
Given limited data on intra-country trade flows in occupation services, we use measures of offshorability
at the national level to capture tradability at the regional level, a correspondence which is admittedly
imperfect. In the sensitivity analysis we show that our results are robust to using alternative measures of
industry tradability.

20

the occupation is nontraded, and dummies for the occupation and the CZ-occupation group.
Regressions are weighted by initial number of native-born workers (by education) employed
in the occupation in the CZ, and standard errors are clustered by state. We instrument for
the immigration shock using the value in (25), where we disaggregate the sum in specifying
the instrument, such that we have three instruments per endogenous variable.
Table 1 presents results for (23). In the upper panel, we exclude the interaction term for
the immigration shock and the nontraded dummy, such that we estimate a common impact
coefficient across occupations; in the lower panel we incorporate this interaction and allow the
immigration shock to have differential effects on tradable and nontradable occupations.36 For
low-education workers, column (1a) reports OLS results, column (2a) reports 2SLS results,
and column (3a) reports reduced-form results in which we replace the immigration shock with
the instrument in (25), a pattern we repeat for high-education workers. In the upper panel,
all coefficients are negative: on average the arrival of immigrant workers in a CZ crowds
out native-born workers at the occupational level. The impact coefficient on xro is larger in
absolute value for high-education workers than for low-education workers, suggesting that
crowding out is stronger for the more-skilled.
In the lower panel of Table 1, we add the interaction term between the immigration shock
and an indicator for whether the occupation is nontraded, as in (23), which allows for differences in crowding out within tradables and within nontradables. There is a clear delineation
between these two groups. In tradable occupations, the impact coefficient is close to zero
(0.009 for low-education workers, −0.03 for high-education workers) with narrow confidence
intervals. The arrival of immigrant workers crowds native-born workers neither out of nor
into tradable jobs. In nontradable occupations, by contrast, the impact coefficient—the sum
of the coefficients on xro and the xro Io (N) interaction—is strongly negative. For both lowand high-education workers, in either the 2SLS or the reduced-form regression, we reject the
hypothesis that this coefficient sum is zero at a 1% significance level. In nontradables, an
influx of immigrant workers crowds out native-born workers. For low-education workers, a
one σ increase in occupation exposure to immigration leads to a reduction in native-born
employment in nontradables of 0.08 (-0.3 × 0.18/0.64) σ, whereas for high-education workers
a one σ increase in occupation exposure to immigration leads to a reduction in native-born
employment in nontradables of 0.15 (-0.37 × 0.22/0.55) σ (using 2SLS estimates).37 These
results are consistent with our theoretical model, in which the crowding-out effects of immigration are stronger within nontradable versus within tradable jobs.
The specification for the log change in total labor payments in (24) tests for the mechanism underlying differential immigrant crowding out of native-born workers in tradables
versus nontradables. In Table 2, we report results for estimates of γ, which is the coefficient
on the immigration shock, xro , and γN , which is the coefficient on the immigration shock
interacted with the nontradable-occupation dummy, Io (N) xro . In all specifications, the coefficient on xro is positive and precisely estimated, which is consistent with the elasticity of
local output to local prices in tradables being larger than one (ǫrT > 1). Similarly, in all
36

This specification, which does not separate occupations by tradability, is similar to the wage regression
in Friedberg (2001) used to examine national adjustment to the 1990’s Russian immigration in Israel.
37
For reference, the standard deviation of immigration exposure across occupations and CZs for low (high)
education workers is 0.18 (0.22) and the standard deviation of the log change in native-born employment
across occupations and CZs for low (high) education workers is 0.64 (0.55).

Notes: The estimating equation is (23). Observations are for CZ-occupation pairs (722 CZs×50
occupations). The dependent variable is the log change in hours worked by native-born workers in a
CZ-occupation; the immigration shock, xro , is defined in (22); Io (N ) is a dummy variable for the
occupation being nontradable. All regressions include dummy variables for the occupation and the
CZ-group (tradable, nontradable). Columns (1) and (4) report OLS results, columns (2) and (5) report
2SLS results using (25) to instrument for xro , and columns (3) and (6) replace the immigration shock(s)
with the instrument(s). Low-education workers are those with some college or less; high-education
workers are those with at least a bachelor’s degree. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered by
state. For the Wald test, the null hypothesis is that the sum of the coefficients on xro and Io (N ) xro is
zero. Significance levels: * 10%, ** 5%, ***1%.

Notes: The estimating equation is (24). Observations are for CZ-occupation pairs. The dependent
variable is the log change in total labor payments in a CZ-occupation; the immigration shock, xro , is in
(22); Io (N ) is a dummy variable for the occupation being nontradable. All regressions include dummy
variables for the occupation and the CZ-group (tradable, nontradable). Column (1) reports OLS
results, column (2) reports 2SLS results using (25) to instrument for xro , and column (3) replaces the
immigration shocks with the instruments. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered by state. For
the Wald test, the null hypothesis is that the sum of the coefficients on xro and Io (N ) xro is zero.
Significance levels: * 10%, ** 5%, ***1%.

Table 2: Labor payments across occupations
specifications the coefficient on Io (N) xro is negative and highly significant, which implies
that immigrant crowding out of natives is stronger within nontradables than within tradables (i.e., ǫrT > ǫrN ), thus confirming the results in Table 1. Finally, we see that the sum
of these two coefficients is approximately zero in all specifications, which is consistent with
the elasticity of local output to local prices in nontradables, ǫrN , being close to one. These
bounds on coefficients values will be useful for model parameterization in Section 5.
Together, the results in Tables 1 and 2 verify both differential crowding out within tradables versus within nontradables and the key mechanism in our model through which this
difference is achieved. In our model the arrival of immigrant labor results in an expansion
in output and a decline in price of immigrant-intensive tasks both within tradables and
within nontradables. Compared to nontradables, however, adjustment in tradables occurs
more through output changes than through price changes. Consequently, revenues and labor
payments of immigrant-intensive occupations increase by more within tradable than within
nontradable jobs, as does native employment. Consistent with this logic, Tables 1 and 2 show
that, within tradables, an immigration shock generates null effects on native employment
and an expansion in total labor payments for immigrant-intensive activities. In contrast,
within nontradables, the immigration shock has a negative impact on native employment
and no change in labor payments in more immigrant-intensive occupations.
One concern about our estimation is that, by virtue of using the Card (2001) instrument,
we are subject to the Borjas et al. (1997) critique that regional immigrant inflows are the
result of secular trends in regional employment growth, which could complicate using past
immigrant settlement patterns to isolate exogenous sources of variation in future regional
immigrant inflows. To examine the validity of this critique for our analysis, we check whether

23

our results are driven by pre-trends in occupational employment adjustment patterns. We
repeat the estimation of equation (23), but now with a dependent variable that is defined
as the change in the occupational employment of native workers over the 1950-1980 period,
while keeping the immigration shock defined over the 1980-2012 period. This exercise, which
is reported in the Appendix F, allows us to assess whether future changes in immigration
predict past changes in native employment, which would indicate the presence of confounding
long-run regional-occupational employment trends in the data.
In the Appendix we see that for low-education workers, the 2SLS coefficient on the immigration shock for nontradable occupations is negative and insignificant, as opposed to zero in
Table 1, and the 2SLS coefficient on the immigration shock interacted with the nontradable
dummy is also positive and insignificant, as opposed to negative and precisely estimated
in Table 1. For high-education workers, the 2SLS coefficient on the immigration shock is
negative and significant, as opposed to zero in Table 1, indicating that future immigrant
absorption is higher in tradable occupations with lower past native employment growth;
the 2SLS coefficient on the immigration shock interacted with the nontradable dummy reverses sign from Table 1 and is positive and significant, which indicates that immigration
crowds in native-born workers, as opposed to the pattern of crowding out that we observe
in contemporaneous comovements. These exercises reveal no evidence that current impacts
of immigration on native-born employment are merely a continuation of past employment
adjustment patterns. The null effects of immigration on native-born employment in tradable
occupations and the crowding-out effect of immigration on native-born employment in nontradable occupations are not evident when we examine the correlation of current immigration
shocks with past changes in native-born employment.38
In the regressions in Table 1, we divide occupations into equal-sized groups of tradables
and nontradables. In Appendix F, we explore alternative assumptions about which occupations are tradable and which are not. The corresponding regression results are very similar
to those in Table 1.39 Results are also similar, as reported in Appendix F, when we redo the
analysis for region-industries, rather than for region-occupations and identify the tradability
of industries following an approach akin to Mian and Sufi (2014). Immigration induces crowding out of native-born employment in nontradable industries but not in tradable industries,
while leading to an expansion (contraction) of labor payments in tradable (nontradable) industries. We also experiment with changing the end year for the analysis from 2012 to 2007,
which falls before the onset of the Great Recession. Using this earlier end year yields similar
results, as in our baseline sample period, of strong immigrant crowding out of native-born
38

An explanation for the coefficient estimates in Table 1 having the opposite sign from those for the
regression in which the native employment change is for 1950-80 and the immigration shock is for 1980-2012
is that the immigration shock for 1980-2012 is negatively correlated with that for 1950-80 (this correlation,
conditional on occupation and group-CZ fixed effects, is -0.165 and statistically significant). Of the 682 CZs
experiencing an increase in the share of immigrant workers between 1980 and 2012, 347 had a decrease in
the share of immigrants between 1950 and 1980. This implies that the proper specification for the 1950-1980
native employment change would be to regress it on the immigration shock for the same time period. When
we use instead the leading period to measure the immigration shock, we correspondingly obtain coefficient
estimates opposite in sign to those in Table 1.
39
In the Appendix F, we also examine whether our results on tradable occupations are driven by manufacturing industries. When we exclude workers in the manufacturing sector, we obtain results on tradable
versus nontradable occupations that are materially the same as those we report in Table 1.

24

workers in nontradable occupations and no crowding out in tradable occupations. When
we alternatively change the start year from 1980 to 1990, the crowding-out effect weakens
for low-education workers in nontradables, but remains strong for high-education workers in
nontradables. Finally, when we drop the very largest commuting zones from the sample, for
which concerns about reverse causality from local labor demand shocks to immigrant inflows
may be strongest, we see little qualitative change in our impact-coefficient estimates.

4.5

Wage Changes for Native-born Workers

Our analytical results predict how occupation wages per efficiency unit of native-born workers
adjust to an inflow of foreign workers. Equation (19) yields a regression specification that
takes the form
D
D
D
wro
= α̃rg
+ α̃oD + χD xro + χD
(26)
N Io (N) xro + ν̃ro ,
following the same steps—incorporating occupation fixed effects, imposing common slope
parameters across regions, and measuring xro using (22)—that led from equation (18) to
regression specification (23). A positive value of χD would imply that an inflow of immigrants raises native occupation wages relatively more in immigrant-intensive occupations
within tradables whereas a negative value of χD
N would imply that an inflow of immigrants
reduces immigrant-intensive native occupation wages more within nontradables than within
tradables.
In the data we observe not changes in wages per efficiency unit at the occupation level,
D
wro , but rather changes in average wages by occupation, wageD
ro . Under crowding out, an
immigrant influx would tend to drive down the wage per efficiency unit in more-immigrantintensive occupations and also to drive out native-born workers whose unobserved characteristics give them relatively low productivity in these jobs. Because the latter effect works
against the former, the prediction for the estimated impact of immigration on measured
changes in occupation-level wages is unclear.40
To confirm this ambiguity empirically, Table 3 presents results from estimating a version
D
of equation (26) in which we replace the dependent variable, wro
, with observed change in the
D
average wage for a region-occupation, wagero (separately for low and high education workers). The results show no consistent impact of immigration on occupation wages. In the 2SLS
regressions in column (2) immigration impacts are close to zero and statistically insignificant
within tradables and within nontrables, both for low-education and high-education workers. In the reduced-form regressions in column (3), average wage impacts of immigration
are negative and significant for native-born workers within nontradables—indicating larger
average wage reductions in more-immigrant intensive occupations—but these results hold
only for low-education workers; for high-education workers within nontradables, the impact
of immigration on wages is near zero.
As a solution to the theoretically ambiguous impact of immigration on observed occupationlevel average wages, we derive an estimating equation that allows us to use observed changes
in average wages (across education groups) at the region level to infer indirectly the model’s
predictions for occupation-level wage changes, χD and χD
N . Log-linearizing the average wage
40
With a Fréchet-distribution of idiosyncratic productivity draws, these two forces exactly balance out,
implying that changes in average wages are equal across occupations.

the simple average value of xrg in region r across occupations in group g.41
P We presentD regression results for equation (28) in Table 4. The coefficient on the term
xro Io (N) πreo , which captures the differential impact of immigration on changes in regional education-group average wages in nontradable compared to tradable occupations, is
negative and precisely estimated in both 2SLS and reduced-form specifications.42 This finding is consistent with immigrant crowding out of native-born workers within nontradables
being strongerPthan within tradables. For tradable occupations, by contrast, the coefficient
D
on the term
xro πreo
is positive and precisely estimated in the reduced-form and 2SLS
specifications. Consistent with the employment-allocation regressions—in which crowding
out is stronger in nontradable than in tradable occupations—the negative impact of immigration on regional wages appears to work more strongly through nontradables than through
tradables. However, the positive coefficient on the tradable component of the immigration
shock in the wage regressions is distinct from the employment regressions in which there are
null effects of immigration on crowding out (in) of the native-born.
41

In Appendix I we use data generated by our extended model of Section 5.2 to verify that there is a tight
link between estimates of χD and χD
N based on equations (26) and (28), and that the slopes of the wage
regressions are roughly equal to 1/ (θ + 1) times the slope of the allocation regression, as implied by our
analytic expression (16).

As a final exercise on earnings, we relate our analysis to the voluminous empirical literature on immigration and wage outcomes. The specification in (28) is roughly analogous to
the cross-area-study approach to estimating immigration wage effects, which tends to find
null or small negative impacts of local-area immigrant inflows on wages for the native born
(Blau and Mackie, 2016). Our specification differs in important respects from commonly
estimated regressions, which do not distinguish shocks within tradable versus within nontradable occupations, as we do above by aggregating earning shocks across occupations into
the O(T ) and O(N) sets. To contrast our approach with standard approaches, which tend
to assume a single aggregate production sector, we estimate the regression,

D
I
I
wageD
re − wagere′ = β0 + β1 xre − xre′ + β2 zr + υr .

(29)

The dependent variable in (29) is the difference in the change in average log earnings between high-education group e and low-education group e′ native-born workers, where raw
earnings are residualized as in (28) before averaging. The regressors are the
 difference in
I
I
immigration exposure between high- and low-education workers xre − xre′ , and a vector
of controls zr for initial regional-labor-market conditions.43 Immigration exposure xIre is the
percentage growth in immigrant labor supply for group e in region r times the initial share of
immigrant labor in group e earnings in total labor payments in region r. This specification
is a reduced-form version of the main wage equation in Card (2009), where instead of using
the change in relative labor supply for all workers in groups e and e′ we use the weighted
change in relative labor supplies for immigrant workers (instrumented as above using the
Card approach). Differencing changes in log earnings between groups e and e′ helps remove
from the specification region-specific shocks that affect workers across education groups in a
common manner (such as changes in the regional price level).
Appendix I reports results in which we estimate (29) using college educated workers for e
and less-than-college educated workers for e′ . We find a negative but small and insignificant
effect of immigration on relative earnings, consistent with the many studies in the cross-arearegression approach. The difference between these results and those in Table 4 highlight how
the correlation between earnings and immigrant-driven labor supply shocks in the aggregate
may hide substantial variation across occupations in the impact of these shocks, as well as
differential adjustment within tradable and nontradable activities.
Summary. The empirical results show that, consistent with our theoretical model, there
are differences in adjustment to labor supply shocks across occupations within tradable and
within nontradable tasks. The allocation and wage regressions are consistent with immigrant
crowding out of native-born workers within nontradables (ǫrN < ρ) and with less crowding
out within tradables (ǫrN < ǫrT ). Whereas the allocation regression is consistent with neither
crowding in nor crowding out within tradables (ǫrT ≈ ρ), the average wage regression is
consistent with crowding in within tradables (ǫrT > ρ).
43

These initial-period controls are the shares of manufacturing, routine occupations, and women in regional
employment, and the log ratio of college-educated to non-college educated adults.

A Quantitative Framework

We next present an extended quantitative model, in which we impose less restrictive assumptions than in Section 3 (large shocks, large open economies, multiple labor skill groups,
geographic mobility of native-born workers), evaluate changes in real wages by occupation
and region, and perform comparisons across CZs and between the sets of tradable and nontradable occupations, which are not the focus of our empirical and theoretical analyses.
In this section, we describe how we parameterize our quantitative model; in the following
section, we use the model to conduct counterfactual exercises regarding U.S. immigration.

5.1

An Extended Model

We extend our simple model of Section 2 in two ways. First, type k ∈ {D, I} workers are now
differentiated by their education level, indexed by e ∈ E k . The set of type k workers with
k
k
education e in region r is Zre
, which has measure Nre
and which is endogenously determined
for domestic workers as described below. The measure of efficiency units of type k workers
with education e employed in occupation o within region r is
Z
k
k
Lreo = Treo
ε (z, o) dz for all r, e, o, k,
k
z∈Zreo

k
where Treo
denotes systematic productivity for any type k worker with education e employed
k
k
in occupationPo and region r. We assume that productivity is given by Treo
= T̄reo
Nrλ ,
k
where Nr =
k,e Nre is the population in region r and λ governs the extent of regional
agglomeration (if λ > 0) or congestion (if λ < 0). We maintain the same assumptions as in
the one-education-group model on the distribution from which ε (z, o) is drawn, where for
simplicity the parameter θ that controls the dispersion of idiosyncratic productivity draws
is common across education groups, e. Within each occupation, efficiency units of type
k workers are perfect substitutes across workers of all education levels.44 The measure of
efficiency P
units of type k workers employed in occupation o within region r is thus given
by Lkro = e Lkreo . Output of occupation o in region r is produced according to (1). These
assumptions imply that, for any ρ < ∞, within each occupation immigrants and domestic
workers are less substitutable than are type k workers with different levels of education.
Under these assumptions, the share of type k workers with education e who choose to
k
work in occupation o within region r, πreo
, is

This simplifying assumption, which allows us to avoid further nesting of workers with yet more substitution elasticities to calibrate, does not imply that education groups within nativity categories are perfectly
substitutable at the aggregate level. We elaborate on this point below. Borjas (2003) and Piyapromdee
(2017), among others, obtain related results for the impact of immigration on education-group wages by alternatively assuming that education and nativity groups are imperfect substitutes in an aggregate production
function that does not specifically model heterogeneous tasks or occupations.

which is also the average wage for these workers within each occupation.45
The second extension is that domestic workers now choose in which region r to live. We
follow Redding (2016) and assume that the utility of a worker z living in region r depends on
her real wage, a systematic amenity for region r, AD
re , which is common across all domestic
workers with education e, and an idiosyncratic amenity shock from residing in that region,
εr (z, r), which is distributed Fréchet with shape parameter ν > 1. Each worker first draws
her amenity shocks across regions and chooses her region, and then draws her productivity shocks across occupations and chooses her occupation. Under these assumptions, the
measure of domestic workers with education e in region r is given by

In Appendix H.1 we specify a system of equations to solve for changes between two time
periods in prices and quantities in response to changes in exogenously specified regional supplies of immigrant workers. These changes are not restricted to be infinitesimal as in the
analytic results above. The inputs required to solve this system are: (i) initial period allocak

Taking as given changes in the population of domestic workers by education in each region, the equilibrium occupation price and quantity changes then coincide with those in our baseline model if there are no
agglomeration forces, λ = 0, and if education groups within each k are allocated identically across occupak

and (iii) changes in immigrant labor supply by region, N̂re
. In Appendix H.3 we extend the
analytic results of Section 3 to multiple education groups, providing conditions under which
immigration neither crowds in nor crowds out native workers within tradable jobs.
We define a measure of the aggregate exposure of region r to a change in immigration as

between the initial and final periods in education e labor supply of immigrants in region r.
This measure xIr captures the size of the change in effective labor supply in CZ r caused by
changes in the local supply of immigrants.

Calibration

We calibrate the model based on the same U.S. data used in our empirical analysis. We
consider 722 regions (each of which corresponds to a given CZ) within a closed national
economy, 50 occupations (half tradable, half nontradable), two domestic education groups
(some college or less, college completed or more), and three immigrant education groups (high
school dropouts, high school graduates and some college, and college graduates). The values

data. Given the absence of bilateral regional trade data by occupation, we make assumptions
that allow us to construct bilateral trade shares and absorption shares by occupation using
only information on labor payments (equal to the value of output in our model) by region and
occupation, Pro Qro , which we obtain from Census and ACS data. Specifically, in addition to
assuming that regional trade is balanced, we assume that tradable occupations are subject
to zero trade costs (τrjo = 1 for all r and j), whereas nontradable occupations are subject to
prohibitive trade costs (τrjo = ∞ for all j 6= r). Further details are provided in Appendix H.
The trade shares that are backed out from this approach imply that the elasticity of regional
output to the regional producer price for nontradables, ǫrN , is equal to η (since trade shares
are zero for nontradable occupations), and, correspondingly, that the elasticity of regional
output to the regional producer price for tradables, ǫrT , is very close to α (since trade shares
are large for tradable occupations, owing to each region being small in the aggregate).
We assign values to the parameters α, ν, θ, λ, η, and ρ as follows. The parameter α − 1 is
the partial elasticity of trade flows to trade costs. We set α = 5, yielding a trade elasticity of
4, in the middle of the range of estimates seen in the international trade literature surveyed
by Head and Mayer (2014). The parameter ν is the elasticity of native spatial allocations
nD −nD

with respect to native real wages across regions, ν = wD −wreD −prr′e+p ′ . We set ν = 1.5, which is

Since estimates of the elasticity of substitution between occupations, η, and the elasticity
of substitution between native and immigrant workers within occupations, ρ, are not readily
available from existing research,47 we calibrate them as follows. Starting in 1980 we feed into
the model changes in immigrant supply by region between 1980 and 2012 predicted by the
I∗
I
I∗
re
Card instrument, N̂re
= 1 + ∆N
, where ∆Nre
is defined in Section 4. Using data generated
Nre
by the model, we then run the reduced-form employment-allocation regression in (23).48 We
choose η and ρ to target the extent to which immigration crowds in or crowds out native
employment within tradables and within nontradables. Specifically, we target β D = 0 and
D
β D + βN
= −0.295 (the latter is the average of the reduced-form estimates across highand low-education native workers), so that our model replicates our empirical finding that
immigration neither crowds in nor crowds out native employment in tradables and crowds
out native employment in nontradables. The resulting values are ρ = 5 and η = 1.93.
The intuition for our calibration yielding the result that ρ = 5 follows from the analytics
in Section 3.2. Targeting β D = 0 in the employment-allocation regression (no crowding out
in tradables for low- and high-education natives) requires that the elasticity of regional output to the regional producer price within tradables, ǫrT , equals the elasticity of substitution
between native- and foreign-born workers within each occupation, ρ. Moreover, since tradable occupations have trade shares close to one in most regions, and ǫrT is a weighted average
of α and η (where the weight on α is one when trade shares are one), we also have ǫrT ≈ α.
Because we set α = 5, it follows that ρ = 5. A higher value of ρ would imply crowding out in
tradeables, which is inconsistent with our reduced-form estimates. Similarly, setting η < 5
D
is intuitive. Targeting βN
< 0 in the employment-allocation regression (crowding out in
nontradables for low- and high-education natives) requires that ǫrN < ρ. Since trade shares
are zero in nontradables, we have ǫrN = η. Hence, we must have η < ρ.
To better understand how the allocation regression shapes our choice of η beyond requirD
ing η < ρ, the left panel of Figure 1 displays the model-implied values of β D and βN
against
49
the value of η if we fix all other parameters at their baseline levels. As described above, β D
is largely insensitive to η because ǫrT , which is a weighted average of η and α, places almost
D
all weight on α. On the other hand βN
is highly sensitive to η because ǫrN places almost
46

Our parameter θ corresponds to θ + 1 in Burstein et al. (2016) and Hsieh et al. (2013).
The latter elasticity is an occupation-level version of the aggregate immigrant-native substitution elasticity estimated in Ottaviano and Peri (2012).
48
We cannot estimate the elasticity using 2SLS in model-generated data since the model only uses the
predicted inflow of immigrants, not the observed inflow. In the calibration, we elect to target our employmentallocation regression results and not our wage regression results, given that our wage results allow only for
indirect inference on crowding in (out) at the occupation level.
49
D
Consistent with the analytic results in Section 3.2, the model predicts that β D and βN
are both approximately equal to 0 when η = ρ = α (so that ǫrT = ǫrN ).

is largely insensitive to η (since ǫrT places almost all weight on α), while γN is increasing in
η and changes sign approximately when η = α (that is, when ǫrT ≈ ǫrN ).
Table 5 reports calibrated parameter values and Table 6 reports the employment-allocation
and labor-payments regressions using data generated by the model.50 Although we do not
directly target the labor-payments regression coefficients, the estimated coefficients are not
too far from corresponding reduced-form labor-payments regression results reported in column 3 of Table 2. The resulting R-squared values for the allocation and labor payment

regressions run on model-generated data are above 0.99. Because these regressions are not
structural, the tight fit does not follow directly from our modeling assumptions. Instead,
the fit reflects the ability of the reduced-form employment-allocation and labor-payments
regressions to summarize equilibrium occupational employments in the model.

Counterfactual Changes in Immigration

Using data for 2012 as the initial period, we consider two counterfactual changes in the
I
supply of immigrant workers, N̂re
, which we motivate using proposed reforms in U.S. immigration policy. One frequently discussed change is to tighten U.S. border security, which
would reduce immigration from Mexico and Central America, the two source regions that
account for the vast majority of undocumented migration flows across the U.S.-Mexico border. We operationalize this change by reducing the immigrant population from Mexico,
Central America, and South America by one half. Following the logic of the Card instrument, this labor-supply shock will differentially affect commuting zones that historically have
attracted more immigration from Latin America. Local-labor-market adjustment to the immigration shock will take the form of changes in occupational output prices and occupational
wages, a resorting of native-born workers across occupations within CZs, and movements of
native-born workers between CZs. The second shock we consider is expanded immigration of
high-skilled workers. The U.S. business community, and the technology sector in particular,
has advocated for expanding the supply of H1-B visas, the majority of which go to moreeducated foreign-born workers (Kerr and Lincoln, 2010). We operationalize this immigration
shock via a doubling of the supply of immigrants with a college education, which we assume
is implemented proportionally across source regions for immigration.

immigrants with education e in region r and Nre corresponds to the number of immigrants
from Latin America with education e in region r, both in the period 2012. Because Latin
American immigrants tend to have relatively low education levels, reducing immigration
from the region amounts to a reduction in the relative supply of less-educated labor. In
2012, 67.4% of working-age immigrants from Mexico, Central America, and South America
had the equivalent of a high-school education or less, as compared to 26.0% of non-Latin
American immigrants and 34.0% of native-born workers.
By design, the magnitude of the shock is proportional to the initial size of a CZ’s population of Latin American immigrants. To characterize regional variation in exposure to the
shock, consider quantiles of our aggregate exposure measure xIr in (33), which captures the
change in labor supply in CZ r caused by the immigration shock. At the 90th percentile of
exposure to the shock, a commuting zone would see its supply of workers decline by 3.0 percentage points, which grows to 8.6 percentage points at the 99th and 18.1 percentage points
at the 100th percentile. The CZs that are most exposed to a reduction in immigration from
Latin America include El Paso, TX, Los Angeles, CA, Miami, FL, and Yuma, AZ. At the
10th percentile of exposure a commuting zone would see a decline in effective labor supply of

34

Figure 2: 50% reduction in Latin American Immigrants: change in real wage of low
education domestic workers and change in education wage premium of domestic workers,
across CZs
only 0.14 percentage points. Of course, these shocks do not represent equilibrium changes in
regional labor supplies. Because native-born workers are mobile, the shock to foreign labor
is accompanied by a reallocation of domestic workers across CZs.
To summarize the labor market consequences of a reduction in immigrants from Latin
America, we show changes in average real wages (i.e., the change in average consumption
for workers who begin in the region before and remain in the region after the the counterfactual change in immigrant labor supply),51 which capture differences in CZ-level exposure
to immigration, and changes in wages at the occupation level, which capture region- and
occupation-specific exposure to the shock. Figure 2 plots, on the y-axis, the log change in
average real wages for less-educated native-born workers in the left panel and the log change
in the education wage premium for native-born workers (college-educated workers versus
workers with some college or less) in the right panel, where in each graph the x-axis is CZ
exposure to the immigration shock, xIr . In CZs more exposed to the immigration decline,
there is a larger fall in average real wages for less-educated natives. At the 99th and 100th
percentiles of exposure, the real wage falls by 1.9 and 3.3 log percentage points, respectively,
as compared to decrease of only 0.2 percentage points for CZs at the 10th percentile of exposure. This real wage impact arises both because of agglomeration externalities and because
native and immigrant workers are imperfect substitutes, so that reducing Latin American
immigrants reduces native real wages.52 At calibrated parameter values, this effect is largely
transmitted through changes in region price indices rather than changes in nominal wages
(see Figure 8 of Appendix H).
Moving to the right panel of Figure 2, we see that because the immigration shock reduces the relative supply of less-educated immigrant labor in a CZ and because less-educated
51

To a first-order approximation, this equals the change in utility of workers initially located in that region.
In the absence of agglomeration externalities, λ = 0, at the 99th and 100th percentiles of exposure the
real wage falls by 1.3 and 2.2 log percentage points, respectively, instead of 1.9 and 3.3 in our baseline.

immigrants are relatively substitutable with less-educated natives, the education wage premium falls by more in CZs that are exposed to larger reductions in immigration from Latin
America. Less-educated foreign-born workers substitute more easily for less-educated natives than for more-educated natives because less-educated native- and foreign-born workers
tend to specialize in similar occupations and because ǫrg ≤ ρ (which implies that native- and
foreign-born workers are more substitutable within occupations than across occupations).
That is, our Roy model in which education groups are perfect substitutes within occupations endogenously generates aggregate patterns of imperfect substitutability between moreand less-educated workers. The decline in the education wage premium is 1.1 and 0.9 percentage points for CZs at the 99th and 100th percentile of exposure, respectively, versus 0.02
percentage points for a CZ at the 10th percentile of exposure.
More novel are the results for changes in wages at the occupation level. To review, wage
changes vary across occupations in response to a foreign-labor-supply shock because workers are heterogeneous in their occupation-level productivity and because occupations vary
in the intensity with which they employ immigrant labor (where we infer these intensities
from historical occupation employment patterns). At fixed occupation prices, a reduction
in the supply of immigrants from Latin America in a CZ would reallocate native workers
towards less immigrant-intensive occupations, as discussed in Section 3, consistent with the
Rybczynski effect. However, occupation prices respond by increasing in immigrant-intensive
occupations, which reallocates native workers towards more immigrant-intensive occupations. Due to the fact that occupation prices respond by less in tradable occupations (i.e.,
output-price elasticities are relatively high), native workers should reallocate towards more
immigrant-intensive occupations relatively more within nontradable than within tradable
occupations. Changes in occupation wages induce these changes in employment across occupations: occupation wages of native workers in immigrant-intensive occupations increase
by relatively more within nontradable than within tradable jobs.
Figure 3 describes differences across occupations in adjustment to the immigration shock
in nontradable and tradable tasks for a single CZ, which we choose to be Los Angeles because of its high level of exposure to immigration from Latin America. The horizontal
axis reports occupation-level exposure to immigration, as measured by the absolute value
of xro in (22). The vertical axis reports the change in the wage by occupation for stayers
(native-born workers who do not switch between occupations nor migrate between commuting zones in response to the shock) deflated by the change in the absorption price index
in Los Angeles. Across nontradable occupations, there are large differences in real wage
changes according to occupation-level exposure to immigration. The most-exposed nontradable occupation (private household services) sees wages rise by 7.8 percentage points more
than the least-exposed nontradable occupation (firefighting). This difference in wage changes
across nontradable occupations is large compared to the 0.8 percentage point reduction in
the average real wage for low-educated workers in Figure 2. Consistent with our theoretical
model, the adjustment process across tradable occupations differs markedly from that for
nontradables. The most-exposed tradable occupation (textile-machine operators) sees wages
rise by 0.8 log percentage points more than the least-exposed tradable occupations (social
scientists, urban planners and architects). The most-least difference for occupations in wage
adjustment is thus 6.1 percentage points larger in nontradables than in tradables.
We also see in Figure 3 the differential consequences of the immigration shock on changes
36

Figure 3: 50% reduction in Latin American immigrants: change in domestic occupation
wage (deflated by the price index) by occupation in Los Angeles, CA
in real wage levels for stayers in tradables versus nontradables. In tradables, there is a near
uniform decline in real wages, consistent with the negative impact of the loss in labor supply
on the absorption price index discussed above. In nontradables, by contrast, the leastexposed occupations see substantial real wage declines—owing to the immigration shock
mostly affecting the absorption price index for workers in these jobs—whereas the mostexposed occupations see substantial real wage increases—as the wage-increasing effects of
reduced immigrant labor supply more than counteract the increase in the price index. Although the second most exposed occupation in tradables (woodworking machine operators)
and nontradables (agriculture jobs) experience a shock nearly identical in magnitude, the
tradable occupation suffers a real wage loss of 0.7 percentage points while the nontradable
occupation enjoys a real wage gain of 3.1 percentage points. These differences in wage outcomes between tradables and nontradables are not evident in our empirical analysis, given
that the regressions reported in Table 4 capture differential impacts of immigration within
tradable and nontradable sets. It is only in the quantitative analysis that we are able to
calculate differences between tradables and nontradables in impacts.
To summarize wage adjustment across occupations in other commuting zones, we plot
in Figure 4 the difference in wage changes for the most and least immigration-exposed occupations on the vertical axis against overall CZ exposure to the immigration shock on the
horizontal axis. The left panel of Figure 4 reports results across CZs for comparisons among
nontradable occupations, while the right panel reports comparisons for tradable occupations.
The slope coefficients in Figure 4 are 0.95 for nontradables and just 0.08 for tradables. To
put the magnitude of these values in perspective, the slope coefficient for average real wages
in Figure 2 is 0.18. In nontradables, CZs at the 90th percentile of exposure have a difference
in wage changes between the most- and least-exposed occupations of 3 percentage points (for
the 99th and 100th percentiles of exposure, it is 6.5 and 9.4 percentage points, respectively),

Figure 4: 50% reduction in Latin American Immigrants: occupation wage change most
exposed - less exposed occupation across CZs
as compared to a most-least exposed occupation difference in wage changes of 0.3 percentage points in CZs at the 10th percentile of overall exposure. The largest difference in wage
changes between the most and least exposed nontradable occupations, which is for the Santa
Barbara, CA commuting zone, is 10.7 percentage points. The within-CZ dispersion in wage
changes for tradable occupations, shown in the right panel of Figure 4, is substantially more
compressed. For tradables, the most-least exposed occupation differences in wage changes
are clustered around zero, and the largest difference, which is for Los Angeles, CA, is only 1.7
percentage points. Consistent with the case of Los Angeles, across CZs we see substantially
more variation in wage adjustment within nontradables than within tradables.
The intuition we have developed for differences in adjustment across occupations within
nontradable versus within tradable occupations rests on labor supply shocks being region
specific (or highly variable across regions) or on factor allocations across occupations varying
across regions. If, on the other hand, all regions within a national or global economy are
subject to similar aggregate labor supply shocks and if labor is allocated similarly across occupations in all regions, there is no functional difference between nontradable and tradable
activities. Each locality simply replicates the aggregate economy. Because of the geographic
concentration of immigrants from Latin America in specific U.S. commuting zones and because these immigrants specialize in different occupations across commuting zones, the immigration shock we model in this section represents far from a uniform change in labor supply
across region-occupation pairs. Hence, the logic of adjustment to a local labor supply shock
applies when projecting differences in labor market adjustment mechanisms in nontradable
versus tradable activities. The next experiment we consider, an increase in high-skilled immigration, will be closer to a uniform increase in labor supplies across region-occupation
pairs, owing to more diffuse geographic settlement and more similar occupation employment
patterns for immigrants in this skill category. The consequence will be less differentiation in

Doubling of High-Education Immigrants

In this scenario, we set N̂re
= 2 for e = 3 (immigrants with a college education) and N̂re
=1
for e = 1, 2 (immigrants with some college, a high-school degree, or less than a high-school
education). At the 10th percentile of exposure to the immigration shock (i.e., our measure
xIr ), a commuting zone would see its effective labor supply increase by 0.5 percentage points,
which grows to 3.7 percentage points at the 90th percentile, 12.9 percentage points at the
99th percentile and 32.3 percentage points at the 100th percentile of exposure. The CZs with
the greatest aggregate exposure to changes in high-skilled immigration include San Jose CA,
Miami FL, New York NY, Los Angeles CA, San Diego CA, and Houston TX.
To summarize impacts of the shock, we again show changes in average real wages for lesseducated native-born workers and the native education-wage premium, as seen in Figure 5.
In the CZs at the 99th and 100th percentile of exposure, the real wage rises by 2.2 and 4.2
percentage points, respectively, as compared to an increase of 0.8 percentage points for CZs
at the 10th percentile of exposure. As in the previous exercise, this real wage impact arises
because of agglomeration effects and because native and immigrant workers are imperfect
substitutes, so that increasing high-education immigrants raises native real wages.
In the right panel of Figure 5, we see that because the immigration shock expands the
relative supply of more-educated immigrant labor in a CZ and because more-educated immigrants are relatively less substitutable with less-educated natives, the education wage
premium falls more in CZs that are exposed to larger increases in skilled foreign labor.
Consistent with the logic operating in the previous shock, this effect arises because moreeducated immigrants and less-educated natives tend to work in dissimilar occupations and
53

Even if all regions within the U.S. are identical, as long as there is trade between countries there will be a
functional difference between tradable and nontradable occupations in terms of within-occupation adjustment
to shocks. By abstracting away from trade with the rest of the world in our counterfactual exercises, we may
tend to understate differences between tradables and nontradables; on the other hand, by assuming no trade
costs in tradables these exercises may tend to overstate differences between tradables and nontradables.

Figure 6: Doubling of high education immigrants: change in domestic occupation wage
(deflated by the price index) by occupation in Los Angeles, CA
not because they are relatively weakly substitutable within occupations.
Moving to adjustment in wages at the occupation level, Figure 6 shows changes in real
wages across occupations in Los Angeles for tradable and nontradable activities. Since there
is a positive inflow of immigrants, most occupations experience an increase in real earnings,
owing to the negative impact of the increase in labor supply on the absorption price index.
For the occupations that are most exposed to the labor inflow, real wages decline, as the direct
effect of expanded labor supply on occupation wages more than offsets the fall in the price
index. However, in sharp contrast with Figure 3, the difference in real wage adjustment
between the two sets of occupations is now rather modest: the declines in real earnings
for the most-exposed tradable and nontradable occupations are roughly the same, while the
increase in real wages for the least-exposed occupations differ by roughly 2 percentage points
between the tradable and nontradable occupations. In terms of relative earnings within the
two groups, wages for the most-exposed nontradable occupation (health assessment) fall by
6.6 percentage points more than for the least-exposed nontradable occupation (extractive
mining). In tradables, the difference in wage changes between the most- and least-exposed
occupation (natural sciences and fabricators, respectively) is 4 percentage points. Whereas
in the case of the previous counterfactual exercise the difference in wage changes between
the most and least immigration-exposed occupations was 6.1 percentage points larger in
nontradables than in tradables, the difference in Figure 6 is just 2.7 percentage points.
Figure 7, which plots the difference in wage changes between the most- and leastimmigration-exposed occupations across CZs, provides further evidence of reduced differences in occupation wage adjustment between nontradables and tradables in the high-skilled
immigration experiment as compared to the Latin American immigration experiment. In
nontradable jobs, most-least exposed occupation wage differences are clustered between 0
and −6 percentage points, whereas in tradable jobs the points are clustered in the slightly

Conclusion

Empirical analysis of the labor market impacts of immigration has focused overwhelmingly on
how inflows of foreign-born workers affect average wages at the regional or education-group
level. When working with a single-sector model of the economy, such emphases are natural.
Once one allows for multiple sectors and trade between labor markets, however, comparative
advantage at the worker level immediately comes into play. Because foreign-born workers
tend to concentrate in specific groups of jobs—engineering and computer-related tasks for
the high skilled, agriculture and labor-intensive manufacturing for the low skilled—exposure
to immigration will vary across native-born workers according to their favored occupation.
That worker heterogeneity in occupational productivity creates variation in how workers are
affected by immigration is hardly a surprise. What is more surprising is that adjustment to
immigration varies within the sets of tradable and nontradable jobs. The contribution of our
paper is to show theoretically how this tradable-nontradable distinction arises, to identify
empirically its relevance for local-labor-market adjustment to immigration, and to quantify
its implications for labor-market outcomes in general equilibrium.
For international economists, the idea that trade allows open economies to adjust to
factor-supply shocks more through changes in output mix than through changes in relative
prices is thoroughly familiar. For decades, graduate students learned the Rybczynski effect
54

In Figure 7, we see that there are CZs that experience very large changes in wages between occupations
even though their aggregate exposure to immigration is low. These CZs tend to be those that have a small
number of occupations that are very exposed to high-skilled immigration, whereas their other occupations
have little exposure. For these CZs, aggregate exposure to the immigration shock is not necessarily predictive
of the difference in wage changes between the most- and least-exposed occupations.

as one of the four core theorems in international trade theory. Yet, Rybczynski has traveled
poorly outside of the trade field. To labor economists, the claim that factor prices are insensitive to factor quantities seems ludicrous. Although recent theories of offshoring (Grossman
and Rossi-Hansberg, 2008) and economic growth (Acemoglu and Guerrieri, 2008) utilize elements of Rybczynski logic, a distinction between adjustment within tradable and within
nontradable activities is missing from modern labor-market analysis. Our framework—which
softens the knife-edge quality of the standard Rybczynski formulation—provides a road map
for studying occupational and industrial adjustment to external shocks in modern economies.
While our empirical analysis validates the differential labor-market adjustment patterns
within tradables and within nontradables predicted by our theoretical model, it is only in
the quantitative analysis that we see the consequences of this mechanism for differences
in adjustment between occupational groups. Individuals who favor working in jobs that
attract larger numbers of immigrants may experience very different consequences for their
real incomes, depending on whether they are attracted to tradable or nontradable activities.
Workers drawn to less-tradable jobs are likely to experience larger changes in wages in
response to a given immigration shock, owing to adjustment occurring more through changes
in occupational prices and less through changes in occupational output. In contrast to the
lessons of recent empirical work, a worker’s local labor market and education level may be
insufficient to predict her exposure to changes in inflows of foreign labor. Her occupational
preferences and abilities may be of paramount importance, too.
We choose to study immigration because it is a shock whose magnitude varies across
occupations, skill groups, regions, and time, thus providing sufficient dimensions of variation
to understand where the distinction between tradable and nontradable jobs is relevant. The
logic at the core of our analytical approach is applicable to a wide range of shocks. Sector or region-specific changes in technology or labor-market institutions would potentially
have distinct impacts within tradable versus within nontradable activities, as well. What
is necessary for these distinct impacts to materialize is that there is variation in exposure
to shocks within tradable and within nontradable jobs and across local labor markets, such
that individual regional economies do not simply replicate the aggregate economy. Returning to the immigration context, the U.S. Congress has repeatedly considered comprehensive
immigration reform, which would seek to legalize undocumented immigrants, prevent future
undocumented immigration, and expand visas for high-tech workers. Our analysis suggests
that it would be shortsighted to see these changes simply in terms of aggregate labor-supply
shocks, as is the tendency in the policy domain. They must instead be recognized as shocks
whose occupational and regional patterns of variation will determine which mechanisms of
adjustment they induce.

Derivation of analytic results
System in changes

Here we derive a system of four equations that we will use in our analytic exercises to study
the impact of infinitesimal changes in NrD and NrI on changes in factor allocations and
occupation wages. We use lower case characters, x, to denote the log change of any variable
X relative to its initial equilibrium level: x = d ln X.

shown above, zr ≥ 0 implies Ψr ≥ 0.
Comparative statics. First, we show that qro − qro′ converges to zero when η limits to zero
and that the absolute value of qro − qro′ is increasing in η. Equation (12) and the definition

Fourth, we show that the elasticity of domestic relative to immigrant occupation wages
with respect to changes in factor endowments, Ψr , is decreasing in η . From the definitions
of Ψr and zr , we have

Note that if η = ρ then Ψr = 1/ρ, and the elasticity of domestic relative to immigrant
occupation wages with respect to changes in relative factor endowments is exactly the same
as in a model in which there is only one occupation. Moreover, the elasticity of domestic
relative to immigrant occupation wages with respect to changes in relative factor endowments
is higher than in the one-occupation model if and only if η < ρ.

Proofs for Section 3.2: small open economy

In Section 3.2, we extend the results of Section 3.1 by allowing region r to trade.
Two restrictions: We assume that region r is a small open economy in the sense that it
constitutes a negligible share of exports and absorption in each occupation for each region
m
x
j 6= r. Specifically, we assume that Srjo
→ 0 and Sjro
→ 0 for all o and j 6= r. We
additionally assume that occupations are grouped into two sets, O (z) for z = {T, N}, where
x
x
m
m
′
Sro
= Sro
′ and Sro = Sro′ for all o, o ∈ O (z).
The small-open-economy assumption implies that, in response to a shock in region r only,
prices and output elsewhere are unaffected in all occupations: pyjo = pjo = pj = yj = 0 for
j 6= r. Therefore, given a shock to region r alone, equation (38) simplifies to

is a weighted average of the elasticity of substitution across occupations, η, and the elasticity
across origins, α > η, where the weight on the latter is increasing in the extent to which
x
m
the services of an occupation are traded, as measured by Sro
and Sro
. When region r is
x
m
autarkic—in which case Sro = Sro = 0 so that ǫro = η for all o—equation (55) limits to
equation (40), and we are back to the system of equations in Section 3.1.

The assumption that Sro
= Sro
′ and Sro = Sro′ for all o, o ∈ O (z) implies that the
elasticity of local output to the local producer price, ǫro , is common across all occupations
in O (z).

Alternative occupation production function

Here we provide an alternative set of assumptions on the occupation production that yield
the same equilibrium equations as the CES occupation production function in equation (1)
(under the restriction, which we do not impose in our baseline model, that ρ > 1). For
simplicity, here we suppress region indicators.
Setup. Suppose that there are two factors of production, domestic labor and immigrant
labor, indexed by k = D, I, with wages per efficiency unit of labor within occupation o given
by WoD and WoI . Each occupation production function is itself a Cobb-Douglas combination
of the output of a continuum of tasks indexed by z ∈ [0, 1]. Workers within each k may
differ in their relative productivity across occupations, but not in their relative productivity
across tasks within an occupation.
The production function of task z within occupation o is given by

where Lko (z) is employment of efficiency units of factor k in task z in occupation o and
where ρ > 1. Therefore, domestic and immigrant efficiency units of labor are perfectly
substitutable in the production of each task, up to a task-specific productivity differential.
A lower value of ρ implies that this productivity differential is more variable across tasks.
The cost function implied by this production function is Co (z) = min{CoD (z), CoI (z)}, where
the unit cost of completing task z using domestic labor is

for which firms are indifferent between hiring domestic and immigrant workers, where Ho ≡

employ domestic workers is given by [0, Zo ) and the set of tasks in occupation o in which
firms employ immigrant workers is given by (Zo, 1]. Moreover, the share of expenditure on
domestic labor in occupation o is simply Zo .

Connecting to the Rybczynski Theorem

In this section we consider a version of our baseline model in which we derive the basic
Rybczynski Theorem as well as an extended version of the Rybczynski theorem in a closed
economy (similar to Section 3.1). As in the Rybczynski Theorem, we assume that there
is no heterogeneity within factors (θ → ∞), that there are two occupations (O = 2), that
productivity is fixed (ar = 0), and (in the open economy version) that the region treats
occupation prices parametrically (our small open economy assumptions in addition to α → ∞
and τrjo = 1 for all jo). Unlike our baseline model, we do not impose CES production
functions at any level of aggregation. Instead, we impose only that production functions
are continuously differentiable and constant returns to scale: the occupation o production
function in region r is

Qro = Qro LIro , LD
ro for o = 1, 2
Online Appendix 11

and, in the open economy, the production of the final good combining the services of the
two occupations is
Yr = Yr (Yr1 , Yr2) .
Homogeneous factors within k = D, I implies that employment of type k in r equals the
number efficiency units of type k in r, Nrk = Lkr , and similarly for employment in occupation

Closed economy: extended Rybczynski

The system of equations is exactly as in the open economy—given by equations (62), (63),
and (64)—except we do not impose that pro = 0 and we include one additional equation,
which we derive as follows. The assumption that Yr is homothetic implies
yr1 − yr2 = −ηr (pr1 − pr2 )
where ηr is the local elasticity of substitution between occupations. Log differentiating

Fixed immigrant wages

Here we consider a modification of our model in which we take immigrant occupation wages
as given, rather than solving them to satisfy a local labor market clearing condition. This
assumption is justified if the supply of immigrants to each occupation within each region
is infinitely elastic (which is similar to assuming that each worker’s productivity dispersion
across occupations is zero, so that relative wages across occupations are fixed) and immigrant
remuneration is determined in a global market. We use this model to relate our results
Online Appendix 14

to those in Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008) (henceforth GRH), since this model of
immigration can be applied to examining the implications of offshoring (in both cases, foreign
wages are exogenously given).
We derive analytic results under the small open economy assumptions of Section 3.2, asI
suming that wro
= 0 and ignoring the immigrant-labor-market-clearing condition. Since the
supply of immigrants is infinitely elastic, we consider as the driving force of our comparative
statics a change in the productivity of immigrant workers in region r that is common across
occupations, aIro ≡ aIr (which in our baseline model is equivalent in terms of factor allocation
and occupation wages to an increase in the supply of immigrants in region r).

It is natural to guess that a decrease in the cost of hiring immigrant labor in region r—i.e. an increase
in aIr —will increase region r’s output and the average wage of native workers within region r. This implies
that dκrg /daIr > 0.

Therefore, if κrg > − (θ + ǫrg ), then the sign of dw

dSro

the sign of (ǫrg − ρ) ar . In response to a productivity increase of immigrant labor, aIr > 0,
native workers reallocate towards immigrant-intensive occupations within O (g) (crowding
in) and the wages of these occupations rise, if and only if ǫrg > ρ. Moreover, the extent
of this reallocation and wage increase is increasing in ǫrg . These comparative static results
mirror those in our baseline model in which the supply of immigrants into region r is inelastic
and immigrant wages satisfy factor market clearing.56
To provide a better understanding of the mechanism that gives rise to crowding in within
this variation of our model, and to link it to the productivity effect in GRH, suppose that
ǫrg → ∞, so that occupation prices are unchanged, pro = 0, for all o ∈ O (g) (whereas
Rybczynski and GRH consider 2 goods or occupations, our occupation choice model allows
for interior solutions in an open economy under any number of occupations). In this special
case, equation (66) becomes

Hence, if Sro
∈ (0, 1) then dwro
/daIr > 0 so that an increase in the productivity of immigrants within region r increases native occupation wages in all occupations. Intuitively, the
zero-profit condition requires that cost savings induced by an increase in the productivity
of immigrants must be exactly offset by an increase in the cost of employing natives. MoreI
D
I
over, if Sro
∈ (0, 1) then d2 wro
/ daIr dSro
> 0, so that an increase in the productivity of
immigrants within region r increases native occupation wages relatively more in immigrantintensive occupations. Intuitively, the cost savings induced by an increase in the productivity
of immigrants are proportional to the share of costs paid to immigrants, which is higher in
immigrant-intensive occupations. That is, the zero-profit condition requires that the offsetting increase in the occupation wage of native workers must be greater in immigrant-intensive
occupations. We derive these results for occupation wages using only the zero profit condition. However, these results for occupation wages translate directly into results for factor
reallocation using the factor-market clearing condition (68): the increase in the relative native occupation wage of immigrant-intensive occupations induces native workers to reallocate
towards those occupations (crowding in).57

(20) does not hold exactly. However, if θ + ǫrg − (ǫrg − ρ) Sro is not very close to zero, then the fit of equation
(20) remains good.
57
It is straightforward to show that immigrant workers are also crowded in.

Online Appendix 16

Changes in offshoring productivity in GRH and either changes in immigrant productivity
or supply in the present paper generate changes in wages for natives. Whereas GRH consider
offshoring of low-skill tasks in a model featuring three factors—foreign labor, native low-skill
labor, and native high-skill labor—our model instead features two factors—immigrant and
native labor—but introduces factor heterogeneity across workers within each factor. At fixed
output prices, in our model native workers employed in the immigrant-intensive occupation
benefit relatively more from an improvement in immigrant productivity or supply, while in
GRH low-skill natives benefit relative to high-skill natives from a reduction in the cost of
offshoring low-skill tasks (through what they refer to as the “productivity effect”). Hence, at
fixed output prices, our framework provides within-group wage results that are very similar
to the between-group wage results in GRH. The mechanisms generating these results are
also very similar, as is clear from our description of wage changes in the previous paragraph.
Recall that in section C we showed that the mechanism generating crowding in (as well the
increase in the relative wage of immigrant-intensive occupations) at fixed occupation prices is
tightly linked to the mechanism in the Rybczynski theorem. Therefore, at fixed occupation
prices there is a tight link between the mechanism generating relative wage changes and
factor reallocation across Rybczynski, GRH, and our model.
Relative to Rybczynski and GRH, we additionally show that when output prices are
endogenous a simple comparison of elasticities determines whether relative wages rise and
factors crowd into more immigrant-intensive occupations or relative wages fall and factors
crowd out of more immigrant-intensive occupations; we allow for many occupations and
variation across occupations in these elasticities; and we show that there is relatively less
crowding out within more tradable compared to within less tradable occupations.

Robustness

In this section we report robustness exercises on our baseline allocation and labor payment
regressions. First, we vary the set of tradable and nontradable occupations. Second, we study
I
pretrends and alternative periods of analysis. Third, we construct immigrant intensity, Sreo
,
using alternative approaches. Finally, we drop certain regions or workers. We first present
robustness tables for labor allocation regressions and then for labor payments regressions.

Industry analysis

In this section we report results of the baseline labor allocation and labor payments regressions applied to industries rather than occupations. In Table 39, we list the 34 industries
considered in this analysis, defining these industries based on the sub-headings of the 1990
Census Industry Classification System.

Table 39: List of industries
We consider three alternative ways to determine the tradability of these 34 industries.
First we construct a geographical Herfindahl index for each industry, following Mian and Sufi
(2014), using labor income by industry and CZ in the 1980 Census. Industries reliant on
national demand will tend to be geographically concentrated compared to industries relying
on local demand. Hence, industries that have a higher HHI will be more tradable according
to this measure. Second, we use Mian and Sufi (2014)’s industry tradability measure directly.
Third, we categorize all goods industries—agriculture, mining, and manufacturing—as tradable and all service industries as non-tradable. The categorization of industries into the
tradable and nontradable sets according to each of these three approaches is provided in
Tables 40, 41, and 42, respectively.

Table 42: Tradable and non-tradable industries
Notes: + : We group all goods industries, i.e. agriculture, mining and manufacturing, as tradable
industries; and all service industries as non-tradable industries. We drop construction industry for
this analysis.

We revisit our baseline analyses using industries and these three measures of tradability.
Tables 43, 44, and 45 show that our allocation regressions are largely robust to using industries and these three measures of industry tradability. Similarly, Tables 46, 47, and 48 show
that our labor payments regressions are robust to using industries and these three measures
of industry tradability. Results are robust to varying the cutoff between tradable and nontradable industries in the two cases in which we have a continuous measure of tradability.
Results are robust to including construction within non-tradable industries in the case in
which we separate industries into tradable and non-tradable using goods vs. services.

Additional details of the extended model

In this section we present additional details of the extended model.

H.1

System of equilibrium equations in changes

We describe a system of equations to solve for changes in prices and quantities in the extended
model. We use the “exact hat algebra” approach that is widely used in international trade
(Dekle et al., 2008). We denote with a “hat” the ratio of any variable between two time
periods. The two driving forces are changes in the regional supply of foreign workers (denoted
I
by N̂re
) and in the aggregate supply of domestic workers (denoted by N̂eD ).
We proceed in two steps. First, for a given guess of changes in occupation wages for
D
I
domestic and immigrant workers in each region, {Ŵro
}n ando {Ŵro
}, and changes in the
D
supply of domestic workers of each group in each region, N̂re , we calculate in each region

Relation between extended and baseline models

Consider a version of this extended model that takes as given changes in the population of
domestic workers by education in each region and assumes no agglomeration externalities
(λ = 0). Here we show that equilibrium price and quantity changes coincide with those in
the baseline version of our model if education groups within each k are allocated identically
k
k
across occupations (i.e. πreo
= πro
for all e ∈ E k ).
For simplicity, we consider the mapping of the model with many immigrant groups and
the model with a single immigrant group (but the same logic applies when there are many
I
domestic groups). Under the assumptions of this subsection, Sreo

Basic analytic results in extended model

In order to characterize changes in occupation employment and wages in the model with
multiple education groups, we use a log-linearized system of equations under the small open
economy assumptions of Section 3.2. We assume that there are no agglomeration externalities
(λ = 0).
Combining equations (34), (35), and (55) (which hold with one or more education levels
e) and setting ar = 0 yields

In contrast to the model with a single education, in this case equations (35) and (75) do not

imply that wro
− wro
is common across occupations.
To make analytic progress, we assume that ρ = ǫro for all o ∈ O (g). Recall that if there
is only one education group, then in response to changes in labor supply there is neither
crowding in nor crowding out for both worker types k. Consider the case with multiple
education groups. Equation (72)simplifies to

We use equation (77) to provide conditions under which there is no crowding in or out for
worker type k when ρ = ǫro . Suppose that at least one of the two following conditions is
Online Appendix 46

satisfied: (i) the share of workers by education e in occupation o, Lkreo /Lkro , is common across
all occupations o ∈ O (g), or (ii) −θwagekre + nkre is common across education levels e. Under
k
k
′
either condition (i) or (ii), equation (77) implies that wro

k
k
′
equation (74), this implies lreo = lreo′ for all o, o ∈ O (g); that is, there is neither crowding

nkre = nkre′ for all e, e′ and labor k is only employed in the set of occupations g, since in this
k
case wagekre = wrg
for all e.
We can use this result to understand why, in the calibrated model of Section 5, setting
ǫrT ≈ ρ results in neither crowding in nor crowding out for natives workers within the set of
tradable occupations, as in the model with a single education group. This is because immigration induces only small differential changes across education groups in native population
D
D
D
across space and in average wages within a region: nD
re ≈ nre′ and wagere ≈ wagere′ for all
′
e, e . Hence, condition (ii) is approximately satisfied for native workers.
In Section J of the Appendix we show that, because conditions (i) and (ii) are not
satisfied for immigrant workers, setting ǫrT ≈ ρ implies that immigrant workers reallocate
systematically across tradable occupations in response to an inflow of immigrants. This is
also the case in the data when we consider the allocation regressions for immigrant workers.

H.4

Bilateral trade and absorption shares

Given the difficulty of obtaining bilateral regional trade data by occupation that is required
m
x
to construct initial equilibrium trade shares Sjro
and Srjo
, we instead assume that tradable
occupations can be traded at no trade costs (that is, τrjo = 1 for all r and j) while nontradable
occupations are prohibitively costly to trade across regions (that is, τrjo = ∞ for all j 6= r),
and that trade is balanced by region (that is, the exports equal imports summed over all
x
m
tradable occupations). Under these assumptions, for nontradable occupations Srro
= Srro
=
x
m
1 and Srjo = Sjro = 0 for all j 6= r. For tradable occupations, in the absence of trade costs all
regions face the same absorption prices, which implies that the ratio of exports of occupation
o from region r to j relative to absorption of occupation o in region j is equal for all j, so
Pro Qro

Average wage changes for native workers

In this section we report results for wage regressions using data generated by our model as
well as for wage regression 29 using actual data.
We first consider our wage regressions (26) and (28) using model-generated data. Panel
A of Figure 9 reports the estimates of χD and χD
N from our occupation wage regression (26)
based on our parameterization in which we vary η from 1 to 7. At our baseline calibration
of η = 1.93, coefficient estimates are consistent with neither crowding in nor crowding out
within tradable jobs, χD ≈ 0, and crowding out within nontradable jobs, χD
N = −0.15. If
D
D
instead we impose η = α = 5 (so that ǫrT = ǫrN ), we obtain χ ≈ χN ≈ 0, implying no
crowding out (in) in nontradable or tradable occupations. More generally—and consistent
with equations (18) and (19) in Section 3.2—for any value of η the slope of the occupation
wage regression, shown in Panel A of Figure 9, roughly equals a multiple of 1/ (θ + 1) times
the slope of the allocation regression, shown in Figure 1.
59

We use balanced trade and the fact that all regions choose the same ratio of absorption in tradable
occupation o relative to the sum of absorption across all tradable occupations.

Online Appendix 48

Figure 9: Estimates from wage regressions in model generated data
The left and right panels report estimates of the occupation wage regression (26) and the average wage regression (28) varying
η from 1 to 7 and holding all other parameters at their baseline levels. The vertical lines represents the baseline value of
η = 1.93 and the value of η = α = 5.

Panel B of Figure 9 reports estimates of χD and χD
N from our average wage equation (28)
using model-generated data from our baseline parameterization.60 Comparing Panels A and
B, we see a tight link in the extended model between the reduced-form coefficients in (28)
(Panel B), which are based on changes in average wages for each commuting zone educationgroup pair, and those in (26) (Panel A), which are based on changes in occupation wages for
each commuting zone. At our baseline calibration, we estimate χD = 0 and χD
N = −0.15 using
D
variation in occupation wage changes, whereas we estimate χ = 0.002 and χD
N = −0.173
using variation in commuting zone wages. Thus, under the conditions imposed by our model
we can infer the coefficients from the occupation-wage equation—which reveal crowding out
(in)—by estimating the average wage regression.
We now estimate regression 29 using actual and model-generated data. Table 49 reports

Although equation (28) is not structural, it fits the model-generated data quite well: across all values of
η, the R2 of our regression is at least 0.98.

Immigrant occupation reallocation

In Section 4 we analyze empirically how native workers reallocate across occupations in
response to immigration. In this section, we analyze the reallocation of immigrant workers,
both in the extended model and in the data.
We first use model-generated data from our calibrated model to estimate equation the
allocation regression separately for all three immigrant education groups:
I
I
I
nIro = αrg
+ αoI + β I xro + βN
Io (N) xro + νro
.

Table 50 reports the results. Consistent with our results for natives, we find more crowding
I
out within nontradable than within tradable occupations: βN
< 0, for all education groups.
However, unlike our results for natives, we find crowding out within tradable jobs for
all immigrant education groups, β I < 0. This divergence between native and immigrant
reallocations within tradable jobs (β I < 0 and β D ≈ 0) is inconsistent with the analytic
results for our model in Section 3, which has a single education group in which case β k ≡
θ+1
(ǫrg − ρ) ψr . In subsection H.3 we show that if changes in immigrant labor supply vary
ǫrg +θ
by education level and immigrants with different education levels vary in their comparative
advantage across occupations, then immigrants may be crowded in or out within the set of
tradables even if ǫrT = ρ.61
61

In Section H.3 we argue that because immigration induces small differential changes across education
groups in native regional populations and in average wages within a region, immigration neither crowds out
nor crowds in natives within tradables when ǫrT = ρ. Hence, our quantitative results for natives are largely
consistent with our analytic results in Section 3.

Table 50: Allocation for immigrant workers across occupations in model-generated data
This implies that our immigrant-allocation regression suffers from omitted variable bias
(whereas our employment-allocation regression for native-born workers does not). Specifically, when ǫrT = ρ, our regression specification for immigrant reallocation omits the term

Because the correlation (conditional on fixed effects) between yro and xro in the extended
model is negative, when we estimate the immigrant-allocation regression on model-generated
I
data we find β I < 0. Table 51 reports estimates of βN
and β I using real data rather than
I
model-generated data. As in the model-generated data, we find βN
< 0 for all three education
groups (i.e., an inflow of immigrants reduces the share of immigrants in immigrant-intensive
occupations within nontradables more so than within tradables). For high-education (collegegraduate) immigrants, we find a significant and negative estimate of β I (i.e., an inflow
of immigrants reduces the share of immigrants in immigrant-intensives occupations within
tradables). Estimates of β I are insignificant for immigrants with intermediate (high-school
graduates and those with some college) and low (less than high school) levels of education.
