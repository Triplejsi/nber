The Term Structure of Interest Rates

ABSTRACT

This

paper consolidates and interprets the literature on the term

structure, as it stands today. Definitions of rates of return, forward
rates and holding returns for all time intervals are treated here in a
uniform manner and their interrelations, exact or approximate, delineated.
The concept of duration is used throughout to simplify mathematical expres-

sions. Continuous compounding is used where possible, to avoid arbitrary
distinctions based on compounding assumptions. Both the theoretical and the
empirical literature are treated.

The attached tables by J. Huston McCulloch give term structure data for
U. S. government securities 1946-1987. The tables give discount bond yields,
forward rates and par bond yields as defined in the paper. The data relate
to the concepts in the paper more precisely than does any previously
published data series.

The Term Structure of Interest Rates1

Robert J. Shiller

The term of a debt instrument with a fixed maturity date is the time

until the maturity date. The term structure of interest rates at any time
is the function relating interest rate to term. Figure 1. shows the U.S.
term structure of nominal interest rates according to one definition for

each year since 1948. Usually the term structure is upward sloping;
long-term interest rates are higher than short-term interest rates and

interest rate rises with term. Sometimes the term structure is downward
sloping. Sometimes it is hump shaped, with intermediate terms having
highest interest rates.

The study of the term structure inquires what market forces are
responsible for the varying shapes of the term structure. In its purest
form, this study considers only bonds for which we can disregard default
risk (that interest or principal will not be paid by the issuer of the
bond), convertibility provisions (an option to convert the bond to another
financial instrument), call provisions (an option of the issuer to pay off
the debt before the maturity date), floating rate provisions (provisions
that change the interest payments according to some rule) or other special

study of the market price of time, over various intervals, itself.

What follows is an effort to consolidate and interpret the literature

on the term structure, as it stands today. The notation adopted is a little
more complicated than usual, to allow diverse studies to be treated in a

uniform notation. Definitions of rates of return, forward rates and holding
returns for all time intervals are treated here in a uniform manner and

their interrelations, exact or approximate, delineated. The concept of
duration is used throughout to simplify mathematical expressions. Continuous compounding is used where possible, to avoid arbitrary distinctions

based on compounding assumptions. The relations described here can be
applied approximately to conventionally defined interest rates or exactly to
the continuously compounded McCulloch data in the appendix.

The McCulloch

data, published here for the first time, are the cleanest interest rate data
available, in that they are based on a broad spectrum of government bond
prices, and are corrected for coupon and special tax

effects.

Section II below is a brief introduction to some key concepts in the

simplest case, that of pure discount bonds. Section III sets forth the full
definitions and concepts and their interrelations. Section IV sets forth
theories of the term structure, and Section V the empirical work on the term

structure. Section VI is an overview and interpretation of the literature.

2The U. S. government bonds used to produce Figure 1 are in some
dimensions good approximations to such bonds: default risk must be considered very low, the bonds are not convertible, and there are no floating
rate provisions. However, many long-term U. S. bonds are callable five years
before maturity, and some bonds are given special treatment in estate tax
law.

II. Simple Analytics of the Term Structure: Discount Bonds

A discount bond is a promise by the issuer of the bond of a single
fixed payment (the "principal") to the holder of the bond at a given date
(the "maturity"). There are no intervening interest payments; thus the bond

sells for less than the principal before the maturity date, i. e., it is
expected to sell at a discount. The issuer of the bond has no other obliga-

tion than to pay the principal on the maturity date. An investment in a
discount bond is not illiquid because the holder can sell it at any time to
another investor. Let us denote by Pd(t,T) the market price at time t of a
discount bond whose principal is one dollar and whose maturity date is T,

t

T. The subscript d denotes discount bond, to contrast this price from

the par bond price to be defined below. The "term" of the bond (which will
be represented here by the letter in) is the time to maturity, in

— T-t.

Thus,

the term of any given bond steadily shrinks through time, a three-month bond
becoming a two-month bond after one month and a one-month bond after two
months.

All discount bonds maturing at date T for which there is no risk of
default by the issuer ought to be perfectly interchangeable, and to sell at

time t for pd(t,T) times the principal. The price Pd(t,T) is thus determined
by the economy-wide supply and demand at time t for credit to be repaid at
time T. The determination of Pd(t.T) is thus macroeconomic in nature, and is
not at the discretion of any individual issuer or investor.
The price Pd(t,T) of a discount bond may be generally expected to
increase gradually with time t until the maturity date T, when it reaches
its maximum, equal to one dollar. The increase in price for any holder of
the bond over the period of time that he or she holds it is the return to

4

holding it. The actual increase in price, since it is determined by market
forces, may not be steady, and may vary from time to time. It is useful to

have some measure of the prospective increase in price that is implicit in
the price pd(t,T). The yield to maturity (or interest rate) rd(t,T) at time

t on the discount bond maturing at time T can be defined, given Pd(t,T), as
the steady rate at which the price should increase if the bond is to be

worth one dollar at time T. If the growth of price is to be steady, then the

price at time t', t

t'

T, should be given by pd(e,T)e(ttd(tT).

Setting this price equal to one dollar where t' —

T, and solving for

rd(t,T), we find that the yield to maturity is given by:

rd(t,T) —

log(p(t,T))/(Tt)

The term structure of interest rates, for discount bonds, is the function
relating rd(t,t+m) to m. We may also refer to r(t,t+m) as the "rn-period
rate," and if m is very small as the "short rate," if m is very large as the
"long rate."

Note that the term structure at any given date is determined exclu-

sively by bond prices quoted on that day; there is a term structure in every
daily newspaper. Those making plans on any day night well consult the term
structure on that day. We can all lend (that is, invest) at the rates shown
in the paper, and while we cannot all borrow (that is, issue bonds) at these
rates, the rates shown

are likely to be

indicative of the rates at which we

can borrow. If the one-year interest rate is high, arid the two-year interest

rate is low (i. e., if there is a descending term structure in this range)

then individuals firms, or governments who plan to borrow for one year may

5

be rather discouraged, and inclined to defer their borrowing plans for
another year. Those who plan to lend this year rather than next would be
encouraged. The reverse would happen if the term structure were ascending.

Most individuals, of course, do not pay close attention to the term struc-

ture, but many do, and firms and governments do as well. The term structure
on any day is determined by those who enter their preferences in the market
on that day. A descending term structure on that day means that if the term
structure had been flat there would be an excess supply of one-year bonds or
an excess demand for two-year bonds. The descending term structure arises,
of course, to choke off this excess demand.

In making plans using the term structure, it is helpful to realize that
the term structure on any given date has in it implicit future interest
rates, called forward rates. In the above example, where the term structure
is descending between one and two years it is implicit in the term structure
that the one-year interest rate can be guaranteed to be lower next year than

it is this year. To guarantee the forward rate one must be able both to buy
and to issue bonds at quoted prices. One achieves this by trading in bonds
of different maturities available today. One buys a discount bond at time

t maturing at time T at price Pd(t,T) and issues an amount of discount

bonds maturing at t' at price Pd(t,t) ,
of bonds issued equals pd(t,T)/pd(t,t') ,

at time t .

where t < t' < T. If the number

then one will have broken even,

That is, one will not have acquired or lost any cash today in

the transaction. However, at time t' one must pay the principal on the
bonds issued, equal to pd(t,T)/pd(t,t') .

At time T one will receive the

principal on the (T-t)-period bond, equal to 1. Thus, the outcome of the
transaction is in effect that one is committing oneself at time t to buy a

6

discount bond at time t' maturing at time T with price Pd(t,T)/Pd(t,t).
The forward rate fd(t,t' ,T) at time t applying to the time interval t' to T
is the yield to maturity on this contract:

fa(t,t',T) —

log(p(t,T)/p(t,t'))/(Tt')

t < t' < T

This may also be called the t'-t period ahead forward rate of maturity T-

t'. One can as well guarantee that one can borrow at the forward rate
fd(t,t' ,T) by buying discount bonds maturing at t' and issuing bonds
maturing at T.

One might thus consider, in deciding whether or not to defer borrowing
or lending plans, a comparison of the spot rate today rd(t,T) with the
forward rate of corresponding maturity k periods in the future,

There is also another margin to consider. One might hold
one's borrowing or lending plans fixed, deciding, let us say, to invest at
time t+k, but to consider whether to tie down the interest rate today at
or to wait and take one's chances with regard to the future
spot rate rd(t+k,T+k).

The subject of the literature surveyed here is how people who are
making decisions at the various margins interact to determine the term

structure. Before embarking on this, it is important to broaden our
definitions and concepts.

III. Fundamental Concepts

111.1 Bonds: Their Definition
The term "bond" will be used here for any debt instrument, whether

7

technically bond, bill, note, commercial paper, etc., and whether or not
payments are defined in nominal (money) terms or in real terms (that is,
tied to a commodity price index).

A bond represents a claim on a prespecified sequence of payments. A

bond which is issued at time I and matures at time T is defined by a
w-element vector of payment dates (t1, t2, ...,

t,,,1, T) where I < t

T

for all i, and by a w-element vector of corresponding positive payments
(s1, s2, s3, ..

. , s)

.

In

theoretical treatments of the term structure,

payments may be assumed to be made continually in time, so that the payment
stream is represented by a positive function of time s(t), I <
Two

kinds

of payment sequences are common. For the discount bond

referred to above the vector of payment dates contains a single element T
and the vector of payments contains the single element called the principal.
A coupon bond, in contrast, promises a payment at regular intervals of an
amount c called the coupon and a payment of the last coupon and principal
(the latter normalized here at 1) at the maturity date. Thus, for example, a
coupon bond that will mature in an integer number of periods and whose

coupons are paid at integer intervals has vector of payment dates (1+1,
1+2,

I+w) ,

and vector of payments (c, c,

c+l) .

that are greater than t , so long as the purchaser continues to hold the

bond.

3

A coupon bond is said to be selling at par at tune t

if p(t,T)

is equal to the value of the principal, by our convention equal to 1.00.

A coupon bond may be regarded as a portfolio of discount bonds. If
coupons are paid once per time period, for example, then the portfolio

consists of an amount c of discount bonds maturing at time 1+1 , an

amount c discount bonds maturing at time 1+2 ,
of discount bonds maturing at time T .

etc.

,

and an amount c+l

Should all such discount bonds be

traded, we would expect, by the law of one price, that (disregarding
discrepancies allowed by taxes, transactions costs and other market imperfections) the price of the portfolio of discount bonds should be the same as
the price of the coupon bond.4
There is thus (abstracting from market imperfections) a redundancy in
bond prices, and if both discount and coupon bonds existed for all maturities, we could arbitrarily confine our attention to discount bonds only or

coupon bonds only. In practice, we do not generally have prices on both
kinds of bonds for the same maturities. In the United States, for example,

discount bonds were until recently available only for time to maturity of

31n the United States coupon bonds are typically traded "and accrued
interest" (rather than "flat") which means that the price p(t,T) actually
paid for a coupon bond between coupon dates is equal to its quoted price
plus accrued interest which is a fraction of the next coupon. The fraction
is the time elapsed since the last coupon payment divided by the time
interval between coupons.

4Conversely, a discount bond may be considered a portfolio of coupon
bonds, though in this case the portfolio involves negative quantities. For
example, a two-period discount bond may be regarded as a portfolio of oneand two-period coupon bonds whose coupons are c1 and c2 respectively.

The portfolio would consist of -(c2)/[(c1+l)(c2+1)] of the one-period
coupon bonds and l/(c2+1) of the two-period coupon bonds.

one year or less. There is also redundancy among coupon bonds, in that one
can find coupon bonds of differing coupon for the same maturity date.

111.2. Interest Rates: Their Definition
The yield to maturity (or, loosely, interest rate) at time t of a bond

maturing at time T is defined implicitly as the rate r(t,T) that discounts

its vector of payments s to the price p(t,T)

E s.e

p(t,T) —

(1)

_(tit)r(t,T)

1

1

The right-hand side of this expression is just the present value, discounted

at rate r(t,T) ,

of

the remaining payments accruing to bond holders. For

discount bonds, this expression reduces to the expression given in Section
II. above. The yield to maturity may also be given an interpretation as

above. Given the price p(t,T), r(t,T) is that steady rate of appreciation of

price between payment dates so that if the price falls by the amount s at
each t. before T, the price equals ST at time T. In theoretical treatments

of the term structure in which the payments are assumed made continually in
time, the summation in (1) is replaced by an integral.

The expression (1) gives the continuously compounded yield to maturity
r(t,T) .

One can define a yield to maturity with any compounding interval

h: r(t,T,h) —

(etT)

-

1)/h

.

In

the United States, where coupons are

traditionally paid semiannually, it is customary to express yields to

10

maturity at annual rates with semiannual compounding.5 Continuous compounding will be assumed here for consistency, as we do not wish to allow such
things as the interval between coupon dates to dictate the compounding
interval.

6

For coupon bonds, it is customary to define the current yield as the

total coupons paid per year divided by the price. Current yield is not used
to represent the interest rate and should not be confused with the yield to
maturity.

If coupon payments are made once per period, then equation (1) is a

(T-t)-order polynomial equation in e1tT) which therefore has T-t

roots. However, given that s 0 for all i, there is only one real
positive root, and this is taken for the purpose of computing the yield to

maturity r(t,T)
Roots of polynomials of order n can be given an explicit formula in
terms of the coefficients of the polynomial only if n is less than five.

Thus, yields to maturity for T-t greater than or equal to five can be
determined from price only by iterative or other approximation procedures,
or with the use of bond tables.

The term structure of interest rates at time t is the function

compounding (using h — .5 ) gives us exactly the yields in bond value

"instantaneous compound interest," "force of interest,' or "nominal rate
convertible instantaneously." See for example Skinner (1913).

against m is also known as a yield curve at time t .

There is a term

structure for discount bonds and a term structure for coupon bonds. If we
assume the law of one price as described in the preceding section, then,

given the coupons, there is a relation between the different term structures.

111.3. Par Bonds
Consider a bond that pays coupons continuously at rate c per period
until the maturity date T when a lump-sum payment of 1 is made. If we
disregard taxes and other market imperfections, the law of one price implies

that the price of this bond in terms of pd(t,T) is given by:

(2)

P(tT) — 1T

+ pd(t,T)

The yield r(t,T) of a par bond is found from P(t1T) by setting the
left-hand-side of this expression to 1 and solving for c:7

111.4. Estimates of the Term Structure

At any point of time t ,

differing by term, m —

T-t

,

there will be an array of outstanding bnth
and by payment streams. Of course, not all

possible times to maturity will be observed on available bonds at any givefl

time t , and for some terms there will be more than one bond available.
There has long been interest in estimates of rates of interest on stand.ard

bonds in terms of a standard list of times to maturity, interpolated from
the rates of interest on bonds of those maturities that are actively trade.
The U. S. Treasury reports constant maturity yields for its own

securities,

that appear regularly in the Federal Reserve Bulletin. SaThmoL

Brothers (1983) provides yield curve data for government bonds of a wid-e

range of maturities. Durand (1942, and updated) provides yield curve d.ata

fact that for large enough T the price p,(t,T) is virtually zero and hence
cannot decline, but will rise dramaticalTy if there is any decline in rd(t
13

for corporate bonds. These data are interpolated judgznentally.9

McCulloch used a spline interpolation method (1971),(1975b), that deals
statistically with the redundancy of bonds and deals systematically with
some differences among bonds, such as tax provisions pertaining to them.

His method produced an estimate of an after-tax discount function and from

that the price pd(t,T) of a taxable discount bond as a continuous function

of T .

Expression (1) was then used to convert this estimated function

into a function rd(t,T) .

Values of his estimated continuous function for

various values of t and T appear in Table A-l. His method allows for
the fact that, in the U. S. personal income tax law, capital gains are not
taxable until the bond is sold and that, until the 1986 tax act, capital
gains on bonds originally issued at par were taxed at a rate which was lower

than the income tax rate. He describes his function in the appendix. Other
functional forms for estimation of the term structure have been discussed by
Chambers, Carlton and Waldman (1984), Jordan (1984), Nelson and Siegel

(1985), Schaefer (1981), Shea (1984), (1985), and Vasicek and Fong (1982).

McCulloch used his estimated Pd(t,T) to produce an estimate of the
term structure of par bond yields, using an equation differing from (3)
above only for tax effects.

111.5. Duration

The term m —

T-t

of a bond is the time to the last payment, and is

9Other important sources of historical data may be noted. Homer (1977)
and Macaulay (1938) provide long historical time series. Amsler (1984) has
provided a series of high quality preferred stock yields that might proxy
for a perpetuity yield in the United States, a series which is much longer
than that supplied by Salomon Brothers (1983).
14

unrelated to the times or magnitudes of intervening payments s1, 2'

Since bonds can be regarded as portfolios of discount bonds, it may

S1 .

be more useful to describe bonds by a weighted average of the terms of the
constituent bonds rather than by the term of the longest bond in the

portfolio. The duration of a bond, as defined by Macaulay (1938), is such a
weighted average of the terms of the constituent discount bonds, where the
weights correspond to the amount of the payments times a corresponding

discount factor)0 The use of the discount factor in the definition implies
that terms of very long-term constituent discount bonds will tend to have

relatively little weight in the duration formula. Thus, 30-year coupon
bonds and 40-year coupon bonds have similar durations; indeed they are
similar instruments, as the payments beyond 30 years into the future are
heavily discounted and not important today relative to the coupons that come
much sooner.

By either definition of duration, if the bond is a discount bond, then

Otherwise, (since payments s are positive) the duration is less than the

duration using (4) is:

Thus, duration may be used as an index of the "risk"

of a bond. The concept of duration has thus played a role in the literature
on 'immunization' from interest rate risk of portfolios of financial

intermediaries. A portfolio is fully immunized if there is complete cashflow matching, that is, if the payments received on assets exactly equal

12This fact was used by. Hicks and was rediscovered by Samuelson (1945),
Fisher (1966), Hopewell and Kaufman (1973) and others.
16

payments paid on liabilities. When such cash-flow matching is infeasible,

portfolio managers may instead try to match the overall duration of their

assets with the duration of their liabilities. As long as the term structure makes only parallel shifts, the yields on bonds of all terms being
increased or decreased by the same amount, then duration matching will

perfectly immunize the portfolio and there is no uncertainty about net

worth. However, the term structure rarely makes a parallel shift, long- -

term interest rates being more stable than short-term interest rates, and so
duration tends to overstate the relative riskiness of long-term bonds.
Other methods of immunization have been proposed that take this into account
(see Ingersoll, Skelton and Weil (1978)).

111.6. Forward Rates

13

The time t discount bond forward rate applying to the interval from

t' to T ,

fd(t,t',T),

alluded to in Section II. above, is defined in

terms yields to maturity and duration in Table 1, expression 1. Using (1)

one verifies that this expression is the same as the expression given in

13The earliest use of the term 'forward rate,' and the first indication
that it can be thought of as a rate on a forward contract that can be
computed from the term structure appears to be in Hicks (1946) (first
published (1939). Kaldor [1939] speaks of forward rates and their interpretation as rates in forward contracts, but attributes the idea to Hicks.
Macaulay (1938) speaks of computing "implicit interest rates" without making
an analogy to forward contracts (p. 30). Of course, the notion that long
rates are averages of future short rates has a longer history; the earlier
authors appear not to have written of computing forward rates from the long
rates, or of showing an analogy of such rates to rates in forward contracts.
I wrote Sir John Hicks asking if he had coined the term forward rate in
the term structure. He replied that he only remembers being influenced by a
1930 paper in Swedish by Lindahl, later published in English (1939), which
which is couched, Hicks writes, "in terms of expected rates rather than
forward rates; it is likely that the change from one to the other is my own

contribution."

fd(t,t',T,h) —

(exp(hfd(t,t',T))l)/h

The limit of expression (1) of Table 1 as t'

approaches T

denoted fd(t,T,T) or just f(t,T) is the instantaneous forward rate:14

(6)

f(t,T)

rd(t,T) +

(T-t)drd(t,T)/dT

or:
(7)

f(t,t+m)

rd(t,t+m) + mdrd(t,t+m)/dxn

It follows that the instantaneous forward rate follows the same relation to

the spot rate as does marginal cost to average cost. To see this relation,
think of in

as output produced and rd(t,t+m) as price of a unit of

output. As with the familiar cost curves, the instantaneous forward rate
(marginal) equals the instantaneous spot rate (average) when in equals
zero, that is, f(t,t) —

r

.

The forward rate is less than the spot rate

where the slope of the term structure is negative and is greater than the

spot rate where the slope of the term structure is positive. An example

'4McCulloch, who was concerned with the effects of taxation, writes
((1975b), page 823) what appears to be a different expression for the
instantaneous forward rate. If we adopt some of the notation of this paper
this is:
f(t,T) —

-{88(t,T)/8T)/((1-z)6(t,Tfl

where 6(t,T) is the price at time t of an after-tax dollar at time T
and z is the marginal tax rate. However, since &(t,T) —

exp((lz)(Tt)rd(t,T))

,

his

formula is identical to the one shown here,

i.e., the tax rate drops out of the formula expressed in terms of rd(t,T)

The tax rate should drop out because both the interest rate rd(t,T) and
the forward rate are taxable.

Thus, the forward rate fd(t,t',T) is a simple average of the instantaneous
forward rates between t' and T
Par bond forward rates can also be computed. These are especially
useful if one wishes to make comparisons with spot interest rates as

commonly quoted, since longer-term bonds usually trade near par. At time t
one can guarantee for oneself a par bond issued at time t' and maturing at

time T (t

T) by buying at time t one discount bond maturing at

buying discount bonds maturing continually between t' and T

whose principal accrues at rate c ,

and selling a discount bond maturing

at date t' such that the proceeds of the sale exactly equal the total

purchases made. If one then chooses c such that the number of bonds
maturing at time t' sold is 1, one will have guaranteed for oneself, in

effect, the rate of interest on a par bond at time t' maturing at T . The

par forward rate F(t,t',T) equals c or:'6
15lnstantaneous forward rates computed using McCulloch's data for large
T-t seem to be very erratic. Vasicek and Fong (1982) have suggested that
the problem would be eliminated if McCulloch had used exponential splines
instead of the ordinary splines of his procedure, however McCulloch (1984)
has disputed whether this would solve the problem.

16This formula for the forward rate differs slightly from that in
with 8(x,y)
McCulloch ((1975b) page 825). His formula replaces

formula is
quite identical to the one shown here if z > 0. However, the

when both t'-t and T-t' are large.

bonds as discount factors, (4'), and compute duration at time t of a bond

of bonds) and selling at a later date. The simple discount bond holding

buying at time t a discount bond maturing at date T and selling it at

IV. Theories of the Term Structure
IV.l Expectations Theories of the Term Structure

The expectations hypothesis, in the broadest terms, asserts that the
slope of the term structure has something to do with expectations about
future interest rates. The hypothesis is certainly very old, although it
apparently did not receive an academic discussion until Fisher (l896).22
Other important early discussions were in Fisher (1930), Williams (1938)

Lutz (1940) and Hicks (1946). The expectations hypothesis probably derives
from observing the way people commonly

discuss

choices between long and

short debt as investments. They commonly speak of the outlook for future
interest rates in deciding whether to purchase a long-term bond rather than

a short-term bond as an investment. If interest rates are expected to
decline, people may advise "locking in" the high long term interest rate by

21The quality of this linear approximation to H(t,t',T) is generally
quite

good; see Shiller, Campbell and Schoenholtz (1983) and Campbell

(1986).

22Fisher (1896) appears to say that the market has perfect foresight
(p. 91). I have been unable to find any earlier discussion of the expectations theory of the term structure. Bohm-Bawerk (1891) discussed how
expectations of future short rates affect today's long rate, but appears to
conclude that the term structure is always flat (p. 280). Perhaps there is a
hint of the expectations theory in Clark (1895), p. 395. Malkiel (1966)
claims (p. 17) that "one can find anticipations of the expectations theory"
in Sidgwick (1887) and Say (1853). In reading any of these works, one is led
to conclude that the hint of the expectations theory is very slight.
23

buying a long-term bond. If everyone behaves this way, it is plausible that
the market yield on long-term interest rates would be depressed in times
when the short rate is expected to decline until the high demand for
long-term interest rates is eliminated. Thus, relatively downward sloping
term structures are indicative of expectations of a decline in interest
rates, and relatively upward sloping term structures of a rise.
Early term structure theorists apparently could not think of any formal
representation of the expectations hypothesis other than that forward rates
equalled actual future spot rates (plus possibly a constant).23 Early
empirical work finding fault with the expectations hypothesis for the
inaccuracy of the forecasts (Macaulay (1938), Hickman (1942), and Culbertson
(1957)) were later dismissed by subsequent writers who thought that the
issue should instead be whether the forward rates are in accord with a model
of expectations (Meiselman (1962), Kessel (1965)). Since the efficient

markets revolution in finance in the 1960's, such a model has generally
involved the assumption of rational expectations.

IV.2, Risk Preferences and the Expectations Hypothesis
Suppose economic agents can be characterized by a representative
individual whose utility function has the simple form:

(11)

U —

u(C
t—0

23Conard (1959) wrote, "I assume not only that expectations concerning
future rates are held with confidence by all investors, but also that these
expectations are realized. Only by adding this last assumption is it
possible to build a theory whose predictions can be meaningfully tested
empirically." (p. 290)
24

where C is consumption at time t ,

p

is the subjective rate of time

preference, and u(C) is momentary utility or "felicity." Calling v
the real value (value in terms of the consumption good rather than money) of
any asset or portfolio of assets including reinvested coupons or dividends,
a first order condition for maximization of expected utility is that:

(12)

u'(C)v(t) —

Et{(l+p)ttu(Ctf)v(t*)},

t < t < T

If there is risk neutrality, then u(C) is linear in C, and

u(C) — a + bC .

Ev(t')
(13)

v(t

It

follows from (12) that:

(l+i)

If the asset is a discount index bond maturing at time T, then v(t') =

Pd(t

,T) and the left-hand side of this expression is one plus the expected

holding return compounded every t'-t periods, i.e., it is one plus

Et(ed(ttT) -

l)/x

,

where

x equals t'-t .

This means that under

risk neutrality expected holding period returns as computed in the left-

hand-side of (13) will be equalized, i.e., will not depend on T .

This

in

turn suggests that a particular formal expectations theory of the term

structure follows from risk neutrality. Of course, risk neutrality may not
seem a very attractive assumption, but approximate risk neutrality might be
invoked to justify the intuitive expectations hypothesis described in the

preeding section. Invoking risk neutrality to justify an expectations
theory of the term structure was done by Meiselman (1962), Bierwag and Grove
(1967), Malkiel (1966), Richards (1978) and others.

There are, however, fundamental problems with the expectations hypothe25

sis as derived from risk neutrality. It is not possible for all expected
holding period returns as defined in the left-hand-side of (13) to be

equalized if future interest rates are uncertain. This point was emphasized

by Stiglitz (1970), who also attributed it to C. C. von Weizsacker. If
one-period expected holding period returns are equalized for a one-period
compounding interval, then

=Eopd(l,2)/pd(O,2) .

If two-period

expected holding period returns are equalized for a two-period compounding

interval then 1d0'2 —
Eopd(l,2) —

Eo(l/pd(l,2))/pd(O,l)

l/Eo(l/(pd(l,2))

.

.

It

follows that

This is a contradiction, since Jensen's

inequality states that for any random variable x that is always greater

than zero, unless x is nonstochastic, E(x) > l/E(l/x))
For index bonds, the equation (13) implies that interest rates are
random, and that thus Jensen's inequality does not come into play (Cox,

Ingersoll and Ross (1981), LeRoy (1982a)). This can be easily seen by

substituting pd(t,t') for v(t) in (13). Since t' is the maturity date,
and the real value of the index bond at maturity is specified as v(t') — 1,
it follows that v(t') is not random. Clearly, (13) then implies that

Pd(t,t) is not random either. It will be known with certainty at any date

before t .

Thus, while risk neutrality gives us an expectations hypo-

thesis, it gives us a perfect foresight version that is extreme and uninter-

esting. It would be possible to alter the utility function (11) to allow
the subjective rate of time preference i

to

vary through time, and that

would give us a time varying yield curve. Still, we would have a perfect
foresight model and a model in which preferences alone determine interest

26

rates.

24

Risk neutrality is of course not a terribly attractive assumpticri,

given various evidence on human behavior. The theoretical literature does
not appear to contain any argument for appealing simple restrictions on

ferences or technology that singles out for us an attractive versiofl of e
expectations hypothesis; see LeRoy (1982a) for a discussion. Cox, Ingersc.
and Ross (1981) offered two sets of assumptions other than risk neutralitr
that can produce an expectations hypothesis for the term structure: cie
involving locally certain consumption changes, the other involving stateindependent logarithmic utility. 3ut by offering such special cases they
not giving any reason to suspect that the expectations hypothesis shc.ild
taken seriously in applied work.

Applied workers, actually, have rarely taken seriously the risk

neutrality expectations hypothesis as it has been defined in the theceti1
literature, and so the theoretical discussion of this expectations h-pothsis may be something of a red herring. The applied literature has defined

the expectations hypothesis to represent constancy through time of diferences in expected holding returns or, constancy through time of the differ-

ence between forward rates and expected spot rates, and not that these

constants are zero. We shall see in the next section that these theores c-.

be described as assuming constancy of the 'term premia.'Campbell (l9E) h

LeRoy (1983) showed (correcting errors in his own papers (l982a
(1982b)) a sense in which when there is near risk neutrality," that s,
when utility functions are nearly linear, the expectations hypothesis is

the empirical literature.25

IV.3. Definitions of Term premia26
There is little agreement in the empirical literature on definitions
of term preinia, and often term premia are defined only for certain special

cases. Here, some definitions will be adopted which are clarifications and

generalizations of definitions already commonplace. As suggested in the
discussion in the preceding section, economic theory does not give us
guidance as to how to define term premia, and so choices will be made here
to retain essential linearity, which will simplify discussion.

The forward term premium f.(tt'T) ,

i — p,d

will be defined as

the difference between the forward rate and the expectation of the

corresponding future spot rate. Unless otherwise noted, this expectation

will be defined as a rational expectation, i.e., Et is the mathematical
expectation conditional on information available at time t .

Ingersoll and Ross (1981) showed that if there are fewer relevant
state variables in an economy than there are bond maturities outstanding and
if bond prices follow Ito processes, then only one version of the rational
expectations hypothesis, what they called the "local expectations hypothesis," can obtain in a rational expectations equilibrium. Campbell showed
that this conclusion hinges on the assumption of a zero, not just constant,
risk premium. He also showed a sense in which the other versions of the
expectations hypothesis (which they claimed to reject as inconsistent with
rational expectations equilibrium) may not be im?ortantly different from
their local expectations hypothesis.

(1986).

The rollover term premium r .(t,t',m) for t < t+rn < t' will be defined

Although earlier authors did not always clearly intend rational expectations, and often used different conventions about compounding, we can
loosely identify the above definitions with definitions given by earlier

authors. Hicks (1946), who is commonly credited with first defining these

in the terni structure literature, referred to both f(tt' ,T) and
as the "risk premium."28 Because of a subsequent liquidity
theory of interest by Lutz (1940), and analogy with the Keynes' (1936)

liquidity preference theory, the risk premium has also become known as the
"liquidity premium." In this survey, the phrase "term premium" will be used
throughout as synonymous with risk premium and liquidity premium; it is

preferred to these because the phrase does not have an association with a
specific theory of the term structure. The holding period term premium

27Note that this risk premium has the form interest rate minus expected
holding yield,in contrast to expected holding period yield minus interest
rate in the preceding expression. This way of defining risk premia seems to
be conventional; the rate on the longer asset comes first with a positive sign.

IV.4. Early Presumptions Pertaining to the Sign of the Term premium
Hicks (1946) thought that there was a tendency for term premia to be

positive. In this context he referred to the forward rate term premium

f,i(tt ,T)

,

but

if this term premium is always positive then by (17)

above so must the holding period term premium h,i(t,t',T)

and by (18) the

rollover term premium rj(t,t',m)
Hicks' reasons to expect that term premia should be positive had their
motivation in the theory of "normal backwardation" in commodity forward
markets of Keynes (1930). Hicks wrote:29
•

. . the forward market for loans (like the forward

market for commodities) may be expected to have a
constitutional weakness on one side, a weakness which

(1946), p. 146.
30

offers an opportunity for speculation. If no extra
return is offered for long lending, most people (and
institutions) would prefer to lend short, at least in
the sense that they would prefer to hold their money on
deposit in some way or other. But this situation would
leave a large excess demand to borrow long which would
not be met. Borrowers would thus tend to offer better
terms in order to persuade lenders to switch over into
the long market.

He offered no evidence (other than that on average risk premia themselves) that would support such a "constitutional weakness" on one side of
the forward market.

Lutz (1940) offered a "liquidity theory of interest" that also predicted positive term premia:
.The most liquid asset, money, does not bear interest. Securities, being less liquid than money, bear an
interest rate which is higher the longer the maturity,
since the danger of capital loss due to a change in the
interest rate in the market is supposed to be the
greater (and therefore luidity the smaller) the longer
the security has to run.

His theory appears to ascribe term premia to own-variance, contrary to
received wisdom in finance theory today.

Such theories were disputed by Modigliani and Sutch (1966) by merely
pointing out that it is not clearly rational for individuals to prefer to

lend short or to be concerned with short-term capital losses. If one is
saving for a child's college education 10 years ahead, it is least risky to
put one's savings in the form of a (real) 10 year bond rather than roll over

short bonds. They proposed as an alternative to Hicks' theory the "preferred habitat theory." A trader's habitat is the investment horizon he or
she is most concerned about, and that person will prefer to borrow or lend

at that term. There is a separate supply and demand for loanable funds in

30Lutz (1940), p. 62.
31

each habitat, which could give rise to any pattern of term premia. Trader's
may be "tempted out of their natural habitat by the lure of higher expected
returns"31 but because of risk aversion this will not completely level term
premia.

The idea that individuals have a single habitat must be described

as heuristic.32 The intertemporal capital asset pricing model typically
assumes maximization of an intertemporal utility function that involves the
entire future consumption stream, with exponentially declining weights, and

thus no single "habitat." However, the Modigliani-Sutch conclusion that
term premia might as well, on theoretical grounds, be positive as negative
seems now to be generally accepted.33
IV.5. Risk Preferences and Term uremia

therefore satisfies the first-order condition (12) then it follows that:34

32Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (1981) consider an economy in which all
investors desire to consume at one fixed date. They find that the risk
premium, defined as the expected instantaneous return minus the instantaneous interest rate, may not be lowest for bonds maturing at this date.
Still, they argue that a preferred habitat theory holds f the habitat is
defined in terms of a "stronger or weaker tendency to h.
against changes
in the interest rate." (p. 786).
LeRoy (1982) has argued that the risk premia are likely to be
positive on theoretical grounds in a model without production, but had no
results on the sign of the risk premium when production is introduced.

where S(r1,r2) is the marginal rate of substitution between time

For equation (20), the precise definition of S(r1,r2) will depend on

whether we are dealing with index bonds or bonds whose principal is defined
in nominal terms, that is, on whether rd(rl,r2) is a real or nominal rate.

With index bonds, S(r1,r2) is defined as u,(C(r2))/(u?(C(r1))(l+)(72Tl)).
With bonds whose principal is defined in nominal terms S(r1,r2) is defined

as u'(C(r2))/u'(C(r1)) x ((T1)/(T2))/(l+)(T2nl). Here, (r) is a
commodity price index at time r, that is, the price of the consumption good
in terms of the unit of currency. Thus, S(r1,r2) is the marginal rate of
substitution between consumption at time

and consumption at time

rate of substitution between t and t' and the marginal rate of substitution

to be above expected spot rates, as Hicks originally hypothesized, and risk
the premium is positive.38 In the case of index bonds, a negative covariance
means that if real consumption should increase faster than usual between t
and t' ,

it

tends to increase less fast than usual between t' and T. In the

case of nominal bonds, the interpretation of the sign of the term premium is

less straightforward. But consider the utility function u(C)

log(C).

Then for nominal bonds S(t,t') equals nominal consumption at time t divided
by nominal consumption at time t÷l. Then, the nominal term premium

f

would tend to be positive if it happens that when nominal

consumption increases faster than usual between t and t it tends to
increase less fast than usual between t' and T.

One can also derive (taking unconditional expectations of (20)) an
expression like (21) for unconditional expectations:
37

.

LeRoy (1984) gives an expression for the term premium defined as the
expected real j-period remrn on an i-period nominal bond minus the return
to maturity of a j-period real bond.
38Woodward [1983] discusses term premia in terms of the serial
correlation of marginal utility of consumption rather than the serial
correlation of marginal rates of substitution. Her principal result is that
in a case where the correlation conditional on information at t between
u'(c,) and u'(cT) is negative then the sign of the term premium may be
sensitive to the definition of the premium. She defines as an alternative
definition of the term premiui, the "solidity premium" based on forward and
actual discounts. The negative correlation she defines is an unlikely
special case. Actual aggregate consumption in the United States roughly
resembles a random walk (Hall, 1978), for which the correlation she defines
is positive.

Thus, the mean tern premium

-cov(S(t,t'),S(t',T))/(T-t')

d(t,t,T) is positive if the unconditional

covariance between S(t,t') and S(t',T) is negative. Such a negative covariance might be interpreted as saying that marginal utility is 'unsmooth'
between r—t and r—T. This means that when detrended marginal utility
increases between r—t and i--t' it tends to decrease between t' and T. A

positive covariance, and hence a negative term premium, would tend to occur
if marginal utility is 'smooth' between r—t and r—T.
If the values of bonds of all maturities are assumed to be deeermiriis-

tic functions of a small number of state variables that are continuous
diffusion processes, then theoretical restrictions on risk premia beyond
those defined here can also be derived e.g. Brennan and Schwartz (1983),

Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (1981), Dothan (1978), Langetieg (1980), Marsh

(1980), Richard (1978) and Vasicek (1978). When bond values are such
deterministic functions of diffusion processes, if the restrictions did not

hold there would be riskless arbitrage opportunities. The assumption of
such a state variable representation has been convenient for theoretical

models. It has even led to a complete general equilibrium model of the term
35

structure in a macroeconomy, Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (1985a), (l985b), a
model subjected to empirical testing by Brown and Dybvig (1986).

V. Empirical Studies of the Terni Structure

V.1 Empirical Expectations Hypotheses for the Term Structure
One need not assume rational expectations to proceed with studying an
expectations theory of the term structure if one has data on expectations or
can infer expectations from other data. The first study of the term structures using an expectations model was performed by Meiselman (1962).
Meiselman proposed the "error learning hypothesis" that economic agents
revise their expectations in proportion to the error just discovered in
their last period expectation for today's one-period rate. This hypothesis
then implies that f.(t,t+n,t+n+l)-f.(t-l,t+n,t+n+l) — a

f.(t-l,t,t+l)).

I-fe took as

encouraging for the model that the signs of the estimated b were all
positive and declined with n. However, Buse (1967) criticized his
conclusion, saying that ".

.. .such results are implied by any set of smoothed

yield curves in which the short-term interest rates have shown a greater
variability than long-term interest rates."
It was pointed out later by Diller (1969) and Nelson (1970a) that the
error learning principle is a property of optimal linear forecasts. They

found that the coefficients b that Meiselman estimated compared rather

n

favorably with the coefficients implied by an estimated linear forecasting

equation. However, the univariate form of the error learning principle
proposed by Meiselman applies only to univariate optimal linear forecasts

36

(Shiller (1978)), and thus the Meiselman theory is unfortunately restrictive.

Other authors have used survey expectations data for market expectations of future interest rates. Survey methods seem particularly attractive
since surveys can be focussed on the institutional investors who hold most

government and corporate bonds, and who are probably not well-described in
terms of the expected utility of consumption models described in the
preceding section.

B. Friedman (1979) used data 1969-78 from a quarterly survey of
financial market participants by the Goldsniith-Nagan Bond and Money Market

Letter. He found that the term premium on U. S. treasury bills d(t,t+l,t+2)
and d(t,t+2,t+3) (where time is measured in months) was positive on average
and depended positively on the level of interest rates. He showed (1980c)
that his model differed substantially from a rational expectations model, in
that the survey expectations could be improved upon easily. Kane and Malkiel
(1967) conducted their own survey of banks, life insurance companies and
nonfinancial corporations to learn about the relation of expectations to the
term structure of interest rates. They learned that many investors seemed
not to formulate specific interest rate expectations (especially for the
distant future) and those that did did not have uniform expectations. Kane
(1983) found using additional Kane-Malkiel survey data 1969-72 that term
premia appear positively related to the level of interest rates.
V.2.

The Rational Expectations Hypothesis in Enmirical Work
Although the rational expectations hypothesis regarding the term

ultimately have claims on the assets of these institutions; still there is
an institutional layer between them and the bonds held on their behalf.
37

structure has had many forms, it has its simplest form used in empirical
work in terms of the continuously compounded yields discussed here. Often,
the other forms of the hypothesis do not differ importantly from that
discussed here (see Shiller, Campbell and Schoenholtz (1983), Campbell
(1986)). In the definition to be used here, the rational expectations

hypothesis is that all term premia: h(t,t+n,t±m+n) ,
'f .(t,t+n,t+m-4-n) ,

0 < m, 0 < n r .(t,t+n,m) ,

0 < m ,

0 < m < n ,

0 < n
do not

depend on time t.4° This means that all term premia depend only on
maturity and not time, and the changing slope of the term structure can onl7
be interpreted in terms of the changing expectations for future interest
rates.

41

The literature testing forms of the rational expectations hypothesis
like that defined here is enormous.42 It is difficult to summarize what we

know about the expectations hypothesis from this literature. We are studyir
a two-dimensional array of term prernia; term premia depend on m (the

40When dealing with par bonds, the expectations model defined here
relates to the linearized model. The assuiption here is that the point of
linearization R does not depend on the level of interest rates, otherwise
the model will not be linear in interest rates.
41Note that in this expectations hypothesis, stated in terms of
continuously compounded yields, it is possible for all risk premia to be
zero. We do not encounter the Jensen's inequality problem alluded to above
in connection with risk neutrality. The problem alluded to by von
Weizsaecker and Stiglitz was essentially one of compounding, and is
eliminated when we couch the model in terms of continuously compounded
interest rates.

42The literature has to do almost entirely with nominal interest rates.
as an observed term structure of index bonds is observed only for brief
periods in certain countries. Campbell and Shiller (l986b) in effect looked
at the real term structure in the postwar United States corporate stock
price data by correcting the dividend price ratio for predictable changes i
real dividends, leaving a long-term real consol component of the dividend
price ratio. The expectations hypothesis was not supported by the evidence.
38

maturity of the forward instrument and n (the time into the future that the
forward instrument begins). Term premia may be approximately constant for
some m and n and not for others; certain functions of term premia may be
approximately constant and not others. Term premia may be approximately
constant for some time periods and not others, or in some countries and not
others.

Testing for the constancy of term premia ultimately means trying to
predict the right hand side of the equations defining terni premia (equations

(14), (15) or (16) above) from which the conditional expectations operator
is deleted, in terms of information at time t. This means predicting
either excess holding period returns or the difference between forward rates
and corresponding spot rates in terms of information at time t. Because of
the relations between the definitions of term premia (equations (17), (18),

or (19) above) it does not matter whether the regression has excess holding
yields or the difference between forward rates and corresponding spot rates
as the variable explained; the difference has to do only with a multipli-

cative constant for the dependent variable. Of course, most studies do not
use the exact definitions of term prenlia defined here, in terms of continu-

ously compounded rates or, in the case of par bonds, linearized holding
yields, but the differences in definition are generally not important.
Some studies may report some tests of the rational expectations
hypothesis that have the appearance of something very different; for
example, Roll (1970) tested (and rejected using 1-13 week U. S. treasury
bill data 1949-64) the martingale property of forward rates by testing

whether changes in forward rates fd(t,t'T) -

fd(tl,t',T)

are serially

correlated through time t. But in fact testing the hypothesis that there is

39

no such serial correlation is no different from testing the hypothesis that
changes in the difference between forward rates and corresponding spot rates
cannot be predicted based on information consisting of past changes in
forward rates. For another example, some researchers have noted that for
large m and small n the holding return h.(t,t+n,t+m) is approximately equ.a.

to r.(t,t+m)-r.(t+n,t+n+m), the change in the long rate, divided by D.(n).
If n is very small, l/Di(n) is a very large number, and the excess holding
return is heavily influenced by the change in the long rate. The rational

expectations hypothesis thus suggests that r.(tt+m)-r(t+nt+n+m) is
approximately unforecastable, and hence that long rates are in this sense
approximately random walks. The random walk property for long-term interest
rates was tested by Phillips and Pippenger (1976), (1979), Pesando (1981),
(1983), and Mishkin (1978).

43

Of all the studies of the rational expectations hypothesis for the teri
structure, of greatest interest are the results in which the explanatory

variable is approximately (or approximately proportional to) the spread

between a forward rate f(tm.n) and the spot rate of the same maturity as
the forward rate, r.(t,t-i-m). This spread forecasts the change in r.(t,t+ni)

over the next n periods. Regressions in the literature that can be interpreted at least approximately as regressions of the actual change in spot
rates r.(t+n,t+m+n) -

r.(t,t+m)

on the predicted change f.(t,m,n)-r.(t,t+n

43The random walk property is an approximation useful only under
certain assumptions (see Mishkin (1980), Begg (1983)). Phillips and
Pippenger (1978) (1980) used the random walk approximation to assert that
the Modigliani-Sutch (1966) and Modigliani and Shiller (1973) distributed
lag regressions explaining the long rate must be spurious. Looking at the
out-of sample fit of the equation does not suggest that term-structure
equations like that in Modigliani-Shiller are completely spurious: see And:
and Kennickell (1983).
40

and a constant are shown in Table 2.
What is clear front Table 2 is that the slope coefficient is quite far
below one - and often negative the maturity in

of

for

low forecast horizon n, regardless of

the forward interest rate, but rises closer to one for

higher n. This result may at first seem counterintuitive. One might have
thought that forecasts into the near future would be more accurate than
forecasts into the more distant future; the reverse seems to be true.
When both n are in are small, both less than a year or so, the slope
coefficients are positive (the right sign) but substantially lower than one.

Thus, for example when two month interest rates exceed one month rates by

more than the average term premium ri(t2l) the one month rate does tend
to increase as predicted, but by substantially less than the predicted
amount.

44

The results in Table 2 look especially bad for the rational expectations hypothesis when the forecast horizon n is small (a year or less in the

Table) and the maturity of the forward rate m is large (20 or more years in

the Table). Here, the spread between the forward rate and spot rate
predicts the wrong direction of change of interest rates. One might
consider it the "essence" of the rational expectations hypothesis that art

unusually high spread between the forward rate and current spot rate
portends increases in interest rates, not the decrease as observed.
It is helpful in interpreting this result to consider a caricature, the
44

.
Regressions for large n and small m are not in Table 2.

Since such
forward rates are very sensitive to rounding error or small noise in the
long term interest rates, we cannot accurately measure such forward rates.
Some more favorable results for the expectations theory with small n
were reported in Shiller (198la); however these results were later found to
be related to a couple anomalous observations (Shiller Campbell and
Schoenholtz (1983)).
41

case of a perpetuity (for which m —

) paying

coupon c once per period, and

where, for simplicity, the term premium is zero. Then the price of the

perpetuity p(t,) equals coupon over yield c/r(t,,l), and the spread
between the one-period-ahead forward consol yield and the one-period spot
rate is proportional to the spread between the consol yield and the one-

period rate. When the consol yield is above the one-period interest rate

r(t,t+l,l) then its current yield c/P(t) is greater than the one-period
rate r(t,t+l,l). This would suggest that consols are then a better investment for the short run than is short debt. Since the rational expectations
hypothesis with zero term premium would deny this, it follows that the

consol yield r(t,c,l) should be expected to increase over the next period,
producing a decline in price, a capital loss that offsets the high current

yield. But, in fact when the consol yield is high relative to the short
rate the consol yield tends to fall subsequently and not rise.45 The
capital gain tends to augment rather than offset the high current yield.

The naive rule that long bonds are a better investment (in an expected value
sense) whenever long rates are above short rates is thus confirmed.

Froot (1987) attempted a decomposition of the departure from 1.00 of
the coefficient in Table 2 here into two parts: a part due to expectation
error and a part due to time-varying term premium. He used used survey data
published in the investor newsletter Reporting on Governments (continuing
the Goldsmith-Nagan data series) to represent expectations. He found that

for three-month ahead forecasts of three-month rates, the departure from

45That long rates tend to move opposite the direction indicated by the
expectations theory was first noted by Macaulay (1938): "the yields of bonds
of the highest grade should fall during a period when short rates are
higher than the yields of bonds and rise during a period in which short
rates are the lower. Now experience is more nearly the opposite." p. 33.
42

1.00 is due primarily to time-varying term premium. But for forecasts of
changes in 30-year mortgage rates, expectations error bears most of the
blame for the departure of the coefficient from i.oo.46
V.3 The Volatility of Long-Term Interest Rates
According to the rational expectations theory of the term structure, nperiod interest rates are a weighted moving average of one-period interest
rates plus a constant term premium; that is, from (16) and Table

r,i (t,t+m,1) is constant through time. Since long moving

Where

averages tend to smooth the series averaged, one might expect to see that

long rates are a very smooth series. Are long-term rates too "choppy"
through time to accord with the expectations theory? It is natural to
inquire whether this is so, and, if so whether it is possibly related to the
poor results for the expectations hypothesis that were obtained in the Table
2 regressions.

Because of the choppiness of long-term interest rates, short-term
holding returns on long-term bonds, which are related to the short-term

change in long-term interest rates, are quite variable. Culbertson (1957),
in his well-known critique of expectations models of interest rates, thought

the volatility of holding yields was evidence against the model. He showed

46See Froot (1987) Table 3. Note that his regressions are run in a
slightly different form than in Table 2 here, but that our Table 2
coefficients can be inferred from his.

For par bonds, it is necessary to evaluate D (k) with (5) using a

fixed point of linearization r, so that (25) will b linear in interest rates.
43

a time-series plot of holding yields on long bonds and, noting their great
variability, remarked "what sort of expectations, one might ask, could
possibly have produced this result?"

48

It is possible, using the expectations hypothesis, to put limits on the

variability of both long-term interest rates themselves and on short-term

holding returns on long-term debt. The expectations hypothesis implies that
r.(t,t-i-m) —

where r1*(t,t+m) is the "perfect foresight" or

"ex post rational" long-term interest rate defined as:

is a forecast

error, if forecasts are rational u cannot be correlated with anything

known at time t; otherwise the forecast could be improved. Hence u must

be uncorrelated with r.(t,t-4-ni). Since the variance of the sum of two

independent variables is the sum of their variances it follows that
Var(r.*(t,t+m)) —

Var(r.(t,t+m))

+ Var(u) and since Var(u) cannot be

so there is an upper bound to the variance of rn-period rates given by the

where in the case i—p of par bonds D(m) and D(l) are computed from equation

Both of the above inequalities were found to be violated using U.S.
data and m of 2 or more years (Shiller (1979), (1981a), (1986),

Singleton (1980b)). Their rejection could have either of two interpretations: The rational expectations hypothesis could be wrong, in such a way
as to make long rates much more volatile than they should be. Or, the
measures of the upper bound in the inequalities could be faulty: the
measures of Var(r(t,t+m)) or Var(r.(t,t+l)) could understate the true
variance.

The latter view of the violation of the inequalities was argued by
Flavin (1983) who showed with Monte-Carlo experiments that if the one-period
interest rate r..(t,t+l) is a first order autoregressive process with

autoregressive parameter close to one (see the next section) the inequalities are likely to be violated in small samples even if the rational

expectations model is true. Such a process shows a great deal of
persistence, and r.(t,t+l) may thus stay on one side of the true mean
throughout the sample thus, the sample variance around the sample mean of

r.(t,t+l) or of r(t,t+m) may be strikingly downward biassed measure of
their true variance.

Flavin's is apparently a viable interpretation of the excess volatility

results. The volatility tests do not allow us to tell whether there is too

45

much variability in long rates or just nonstationarity in short rates. They
allow us to reject the idea that movements in long rates can be interpreted in terms of rational expectations of movements in short rates within
the range historically observed.

V.4 Encouraging Results for the Rational Expectations Hvtothesis
It does not follow from the Table 2 results with small n that the
spread between very long-term interest rates and short-term interest rates

is totally wrong from the standpoint of the expectations hypothesis. One
way of summarizing the relatively good results (Shiller [1986]) for this
spread for larger n is to compute both actual and perfect foresight spreads
between very long-term interest rates and short-term interest rates.

Defining the spread S.(m) —

r.(t,t+m)

r(tt+l)

-

(in integer > 1) then the

rational expectations hypothesis implies:

(29)

S.(In) —

ES(m)

(30)

St(m)

ri*(t,t±m) -

i — p,d
r.(t,t+l)

*
*
From the definition (26) of r. (t,t+m), it can be shown that S.(m) is the
duration weighted average of expected changes in the n-period rate.
Equation (29) thus asserts that when long rates are high relative to short
rates the weighted average of increases in short rates should tend to be

high. The values of Sd(m) and Sd(m) are plotted for m—l0 in figure 4 for
those years for which data are available in the appendix. The correspon-

dence between Sd(m) and Sd(m) is apparent. This might be viewed as a
striking confirmation of some element of truth in the expectations hypothesis. Moreover, a variance inequality analogous to (28) above is that

var(S(m)) Var(S(m)). This variance inequality is satisfied by the data.
This result does not by itself establish whether or not Flavin's view of t-.e

46

variance inequality violation described in the preceding section is
correct.

50

One must consider, though, whether this apparent confirmation of the
expectations theory for large m cou.d also be described in a less inspiring

way: as reflecting largely just that the long rate is much smoother than
the short rate. In fact, the correspondence in postwar U. S. data between
S(l0,l) and Std(lO,l) would still be apparent if the long rate r(t,t-4-l0)

had been a simple trend through the path of short rates. Short-term
interest rates have shown an apparent tendency to revert to trend, thus a
duration weighted average of future changes in the short rate is approximately minus the detrended short rate.
It was shown by Modigliani and Shiller [1973] and Shiller [1972]

(following Sutch [1967]) that a regression of a long rate on a distributed
lag of short rates produces distrib..ted lag coefficients that crudely
resembled the "optimal" distributed lag coefficients implied by an autore-

gression in first differences for the short rate. Similarly a regression of
the long rate on a distributed lag of short rates and a distributed lag of
inflation rates is consistent with a vector autoregression in first differ-

ences using the short rate and the inflation rate.51 The basic principle
50

*

Indeed, even if S(m) and S.(m) look good by this criterion, there

could be some small noise contai.inafing S .(in) which, if the noise is not
highly serially uncorrelated, could cause*olding period yields to be much
more volatile than would b implied by the expectations model. Moreover, the

appearance of S.(m) and S.(m) may also be relatively little affected by a
gross overstatement of the variability of r.(t,t+m), so long as it is
substantially less variable than the short ate. See Shiller (1986).

51Distributed lag regressions explaining the term structure have had
different functional forms: see for example Bierwag and Grove (1967),
Cargill and Meyer (1972) or Malkiel (1966). A comparison of eight different
distributed models of the term stru:ture is in Dobson, Sutch and Vanderford
47

of these analyses can be illustrated by assuming for simplicity here (as in
Flavin) that the short rate r (t,t+l) follows a first-order autoregressive
process around a mean i:
where

is a realization of a random variable with zero mean independent of

Ak(r(t,t+l)p).

(31) and (32) imply:

(33) r (t,t+o)

(1-7)
r (t,t+1) + 'i'.
(l-7A)

One can therefore evaluate the rational expectations model by first

regressing r (t+l,t+2) on r(tt+l) and a constant (i.e. estimating A in
31), and computing the theoretical coefficient of r(t) using (33). This
theoretical coefficient can be compared with the slope coefficient in a
regression of r(t, t+co) onto r (t,t-i-l) and a constant. Now, in fact, our

assumption that r (t,t+l) was forecast by the market according to (31) would

imply that (33) should hold without error. However, it can be shown that

whether or not r(t,t+l) is an AR-l process if

(1976).
48

is the

optimal forecast of r(t+kt+k+l) conditional on an information set that
includes r(t,t+l), then a theoretical regression of r (t,t+a) on r(t,t+1)
and a constant should produce the coefficient (l--y)/(1---1A), where A is the

slope coefficient in a theoretical regression of r (t+l,t+2) on r(t,t+l),
(Shiller [19721). With this assumption, there is an error term in (33)
reflecting information held by market participants beyond r(t,t+l).
Comparing such estimated coefficients using more complicated autoregression
models was the method used in the aforementioned papers.
Note that if y and A are both near one, then (l-y)/l--1A) may be very

sensitive to A. When data are limited, we cannot tell with much accuracy
what A is, and hence cannot pin down what is the value of (l-7)/(l-7A).
Thus, we cannot say with much assurance whether the consol yield in fact is
or is not too volatile.
Such simple comparisons of estimated coefficients are not formal tests

of the rational expectations model. Rather, they are indications of the
"fit" of the model. If we are given data on a consol yield r(t,cx) and the
one period rate r(t,l), then a likelihood ratio test of all restrictions of
the model (except for a restriction implied by the stationarity of

amounts to nothing more than a regression of the excess return h(t,t+1,) -

Note that such tests may not have much power to determine whether long

rates are too volatile to accord with market efficiency. Suppose, for
example, that the short rate r(t,t+l) is a first-order autoregressive
process as above, and suppose that the long rate overreacts to the short
rate, r(t,c)-.

excess return is approximately proportional to b, and changing b would do
little more than scale it up or down. If the excess return is not very
forecastable for one b, it is likely also to be not very forecastable for
another b. Then, a regression of excess holding returns on the short rate

may have little power to detect even major departures of b from (1-)/(1-

Tests of the rational expectations model are not so straightforward
when using data on a single long rate that is not a consol yield and a short

rate. Sargent (1979) showed how, using a companion-form vector autoregression, it is readily possible to test the restrictions implied by the
rational expectations model even with such data. He was unable to reject
these restrictions on the vector autoregression of long and short rates
using a likelihood ratio test. However, it was later discovered that
Sargent's paper did not test all restrictions, and when the additional
restrictions were incorporated into the analysis, the hypothesis was
rejected (Hansen and Sargent (1981), Shiller (l98la)). These rejections,
however, do not deny the similarity between actual and optimal distributed
lag coefficients. Campbell and Shiller (l986a) used a cointegrated vector
autoregressive framework, where the vector contained two elements, the long
rate and the short rate, and confirmed both that the rational expectations
model is rejected with a Wald test and that the model is of some value in
describing how long rates respond to short rates and their own lagged
values.

There is also some evidence that the relation of long rates to lagged
50

interest rates changes approximately appropriately when the stochastic
properties of interest rates change. It was shown by Shiller (1985) that
such a correspondence between the distribution lag coefficients holds up
crudely speaking even when one uses 19th century U.S. data, or 19th or 20th

century British data. In the 19th century in Britain, for example, short
rates appeared to be sharply mean reverting, so that long rates should have
been nearly constant: indeed the distributed lag regressions of the British
consol yield on the short rates showed sharply reduced coefficients relative
to the 20th century coefficients in a distributed lag regression of long

rates on short rates. Mankiw, Miron, and Weil (1986) found an abrupt, and
they interpreted appropriate, given the rational expectations model, change
in the distributed lag coefficients, at the time of the founding of the
Federal Reserve.

How is it then that the forward-spot spread f(t,t+m, t+m+n) -

r(t,t+m)

seems to predict well only for large n and not small n? Faina and Bliss
(1986) interpreted this finding as reflecting the fact that interest rates

are not very forecastable into the near future, but better forecastable into

the more distant future. He gave as an example the story of AR-l Model
described in connection with equations 31 - 33 above. The expectation as of
time t

or

the change r(t+n,t+n+l) -

r(t,t+l)

is (ynl)(r(t,t+l)i). For -y

close to, but below, one, the variance of the expected change is quite small

for small n, and grows with n. Thus, for small n any noise in the term
premium might swamp out the component in the forward spot spread
F(t,t+n,t+m+n) -

r(t,t+m)

that is due to predictable change in interest

rates.

V.5. Interpreting Departures from the Expectations Theory

51

Of course, as a matter of tautology, the fact that the coefficients in
Table 2 do not all equal one has something to do with time-varying term

premia. But the nature of the time varying term premia has not been given
an ample description for all n and in.

One story for the negative coefficients in Table 2 for large in

(

20

years) and small n ( one year) is that there might be noise in term premia
on long-term interest rates unrelated to short-term interest rates. The
noise might be due to exogenous shift to investor demand, or even to

changing fashions and fads in investing. Suppose, for example, that this
"noise" is serially uncorrelated, as though it were due to an error in

measuring long-term interest rates.52 Consider for simplicity consols, m,

for which f(t,t+n,) -

r(t,) (D(n)/(D() D(n))(r(t,) r(t,n)).
r(t,) on this then one has r(t,) on both

-

If one regresses r(t+n,') -

sides of the equation with opposite signs. Thus, any "noise" in r(tco)
might give a negative slope coefficient in the regression.

This simple story about extraneous noise like measurement error in long
rates, while suggestive, is not completely adequate in explaining the wrong
signs in the Table 2 regressions for large in

the and small n. If the

problem were just exogenous noise in long rates then an instrumental
variables approach to the estimation of the above regressions with economic
variables as instruments would correct the wrong sign; yet it does not

52Just as well, the wrong signs in some regressions could be due to
measurement error in interest rates, a point considered and rejected as the
main explanation for the wrong signs by Shiller (1979) and Mankiw (1986).
However, measurement error is taken more seriously by Stambaugh (1986) and
Brown and Dybvig (1986). The latter needed measurement error to study the
one-factor version of the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model because without it there
would be a perfect dependence among the interest rates of different
maturity.
52

(Mankiw (1986).

A different story for the wrong sign in the regression is that long

rates do not react properly to short rates. The distributed lag regressions
noted above of long rates on short rates, while similar to the distributed
lag implied by an autoregressive forecasting regression for short rates, are

not quite the same. In fact, the distributed lag coefficient of long rates
on short rates tend to show too simple a pattern, like a simple exponential
decay pattern instead of a relatively choppy pattern seen in the optimal
responses of long rates to short rates implied by the forecasting equation

(Shiller (1985)). This result might come about because people who price
long bonds tend to blur the past somewhat in their memories, or because
people use a simple "conventional" pricing rule for long bonds.53

V.6 Seasonality and Interest Rates
The above discussion suggests that the expectations hypothesis works
best when interest rate movements are well forecastable. With many economic
variables seasonal movements are forecastable far into the future. If there
is any seasonality in interest rates, one would expect to see a seasonal
pattern to the term structure. We would not expect that long rates and short
rates should show the same seasonal pattern, that is, reach their highest
point in the same month. Instead, the expectations theory would predict a
phase shift between long and short rates. Macaulay (1938) investigated
whether this occurred using data on call money and time rates 1890 to 1913,

Keynes (1936) said that the long rate is highly conventional . .
actual value is largely governed by the prevailing view as to what its
value is expected to be." The idea here is apparently that a simple rule of
thumb used to price long-term bonds may become validated when market prices
appear to follow the rule.

its

53

and concluded that there was "evidence of definite and relatively successful
forecasting,"54 for seasonal movements, though not for movements other than
seasonals.

Sargent (1971) noted that the maturity on the call rates was not well-

defined, and in fact the actual maturities of the call loans are likely to
have had a seasonality themselves. He thus sought to reproduce Macaulay's
work using more recent data for which maturity can be defined more
precisely. Sargent showed that in a perfect foresight model the simple
expectations theory for discount bonds implies that the rn-period rate

rd(t,t+m) should lead the 1-period rate rd(t,t+l) by (m-l)/2 periods across
all frequencies. He used U. S. Treasury Bill rates on one to thirteen week
bills for 1953 to 1960. He found that long rates did tend to lead short
rates at the seasonal frequencies, but by much less than the theoretical (ml)/2.

The post World War II data set that Sargent used, however, contained a
much milder seasonal than was evident in the prewar data that Macaulay had
used. The Federal Reserve was founded in 1913 to "provide an elastic
currency" and this clearly meant that one of their missions was to eliminate
seasonals, which they then largely did (See Shiller (1980) and Miron (1984),

(l986)). Mankiw and Miron (1986) found a time series on pre-1913 U. S.
interest rates for which maturity was better defined, and found more
encouraging results for the expectations theory.

54F. Macaulay, (1938), p. 36.
55Clark (1986) questioned whether the decline in seasonality was due to
the founding of the Fed. He noted that seasonals disappeared in the United
States and other countries at about the same time, and that seasonals
disappeared approximately three years before the seasonals in currency and
high powered money changed.
54

V.7 The Sign of Term Premia
Kim (1986) investigated whether the observed terni premium between

nominal 3 and 6-month treasury bills in the United States 1959-1986 could be
reconciled with the covariance between S(t,t+3) and S(t+3,t+6) as described
by equation 22 or 24 as the theory prescribes. He used a co-integrated
vector autoregressive model for the two log interest rates, log consumption
and a log price index, and a lognormality assumption for the error term. He
transformed the vector with the cointegrating vector so that the transformed
vector has as elements the spread between the two log interest rates, the
change in one of the interest rates, the change in log real consumption and

the change in the log price index. For the model, the covariance in
equation 22 is constant through time. He tested the restrictions across the
mean vector, coefficient vector and variance matrix of residuals using a
Wald test. The test rejected the restrictions; on the other hand, the sign
of the term premium is as predicted by the sign of the covariance.
Other studies of consumption and the term structure of interest rates
looked at short-term real returns on long and short bonds and their correlation with real consumption changes, to see if the difference in mean real
returns between long and short bonds could be reconciled with the covariance
of real returns with real marginal rates of substitution. Grossman, Melino

and Shiller (1985) found that the excess real one-period returns between
long-term debt and short-term debt had negligible correlation with real per
capita consumption changes with annual U. S. data 1890-1981 and with U. S.
quarterly data 1953-83. They rejected at high significance levels the
covariance restrictions using a vector autoregression model including real

55

returns on long-term debt, short-term debt, and corporate stocks.56

V.8. Modelling Time-Varying Term Premip
Since the rational expectations hypothesis can be rejected, as dis-

cussed above, it follows that the term premium is time-varying. Although the
term premium is not observed itself without error, we can study its projec-

tion onto any information set by regressing the variables represented on the
right-hand-sides of the expressions defining term premia, (14), (15), and
(16) above, from which the expectations operators have been deleted, onto
information available at time t. The above discussion of the projection onto
the forward-spot spread concerns only one possible such regression.

There is no theory of the term structure well-developed enough to allow us
to predict what variables to use, so the empirical literature here often
looks like a "fishing expedition."

Kessel (1965) regressed the forward-spot spread fd(t,t+1,t+2)
rd(t+l,t+2) Ofl

rd(t,t+l)

where the time unit is four weeks to test whether

term premia are related to the level of interest rates. He found using
monthly U. S. treasury bill data 1949-61 that there was a positive coefficient on rd(t,t+l). However, Nelson (l972b) using analogous methodology
found the opposite sign for the coefficient of the interest rate. Both
Kessel and Nelson gave theories why risk considerations should imply the

sign they got. Shiller (1979) in effect regressed f(t,t+1,t+in+1) -

r(t+1,t+m-4-l)

on r(t,t+m) for m very large with quarterly, monthly and

annual time periods for U. S. and U. K. history and found a consistently

positive coefficient, which was interpreted as a sign of possible excess
volatility of long-rates. Campbell and Shiller (1984) in effect found a
negative slope coefficient in a regression (in effect) of fd(t,t+l,t+24l) -

rd(t+l,t+24l)

on rd(t,t+l) where time is measured in months, and interpreted

this result as reflecting a possible underreaction of long rates to short
rates. It is difficult to produce a useful summary of these conflicting
results.

Other researchers have used some measure of the variability of interest
rates in such regressions. Modigliarii and Shiller (1973) and Shiller

Campbell and Schoenholtz (1983) used a moving standard deviation of interest
rates. Fama (1976), Mishkin (1982) and Jones and Roley (1983) and Bodie,

Kane and MacDonald (1984) used other measures of the variability in interest
rates. Such measures were often statistically significant. Engle, Lilien and
Robins (1987) used an ARCH model to model time-varying variance of interest
rates, and concluded that the risk premium so modelled helps to explain the
failures of the expectations theory.

Still other variables have been used to explain time-varying term
premia. Nelson (l972b) used an index of business confidence. Shiller
Campbell and Schoenholtz (1983) used a measure of the volume of trade in
bonds. Keini and Stambaugh (1986) used a low-grade yield spread variable (the

difference between yields on long-term under-BAA-rated corporate bonds and

short-term treasury bills), and a small-firm variable (the log of the share
price, averaged equally across the quintile of smallest market value on the
New York Stock Exchange). Campbell (1987) used a latent variable model of
the returns on bills, bonds and common stocks to infer time-varying risk
premia in all three markets.

57

V.9. Flow of Funds Models
Clearly term premia do vary and are correlated with observable
economic variables. But what kind of structural model might clarify why they
vary? One might expect that when the federal government issues a large
amount

of

long term debt, the supply of long-term debt should rise and other

things equal term premia should rise. One might also expect that in time
when funds flow into life insurance companies, major purchasers of long-term
bonds, then the demand for long term debt should rise and, other things
equal, term premia should decline. Thus, the term structure might be related
to such flows of funds.57

There was a flurry of research on the effects of government debt policy
on the term structure following the policy, brought in by the Kennedy
Administration in the U. S. in 1961, known as "Operation Twist". Operation
Twist consisted of Federal Reserve open market operations and Treasury debt
management operations directed toward shortening the average term to
maturity of outstanding public debt, with the intention of 'twisting' the
term structure.58 Okun (1963) and Scott (1965) correlated the term structure
with federal debt measures without accounting for expectations. Modigliani
and Sutch (1966), (1967) added dummy or debt composition variables to their
distributed lag regressions of long rates on short rates, but found evidence

D7Co:iversely when the government attempts to peg the term structure,
there should be consequential flows of demand across maturities. Walker
(1954) noted that when the Federal Reserve attempted to peg an upward
sloping term structure there was a great shift out of short-term securities
into long-term securities by the holders of government debt. Such a shift is
implied by the expectations hypothesis.
58Operation twist also involved relaxing some interest rate ceilings.
The federal debt structure during the early 1960's in fact went in exactly
the opposite direction to what was implied by operation twist, as the
Treasury's debt policy was contradicting the Fed's. See B. Friedman, (1981).
58

of only a "weak" effect of national debt on the term structure. Indeed the
simple distributed lag on short rates explained long rates so well, that
there was little room for much improvement of fit using debt policy varia-

bles. 59

.

.

.

.

The Modigliani-Sutch conclusions were criticized by Wallace (1965)

for the assumption that government debt policy is exogenous over the sample
period.

There is a substantial literature on models that relate interest rates
to such flows of funds, see for example Ando and Modigliani (1975), Brainard
and Tobin (1968), DeLeeuw (1965), Friedman (1977), (1980a), Hendershott
(1971), or Backus, Brainard, Smith and Tobin (1980). But much of this
literature makes no explicit use of expectations of future interest rates
that ought to play a pivotal role in the term structure of interest rates.

Many of the models are not complete, e. g. providing estimates of some
demands for funds, and not providing a general equilibrium that might give a
theory of the term structure.

Friedman and Roley (1979) and Roley (1982) estimated a flow of funds
model (along lines of Friedman (1977), (l980b), and Roley (1977)) but
incorporating as determinants of the demand functions not yields to maturity
but rational expectations of short-run returns.
Flow of funds modelling has offered the promise of estimating
consistently general equilibrium models of the determination of interest
rates, but such modelling has to date been hampered by the same problems
that have prevented any consensus on other inacroeconometric models. A lot of

subjective judgment goes into specifying the identifying restrictions,

59B. Friedman (1977), (1981) did find a significant coefficient in a
term structure equation for a variable which was the ratio of outstanding
federal long-term securities to outstanding federal short-term securities.
59

exogeneity specifications and other assumptions that lie behind a compli-

cated simultaneous equation model. Hence, there is a lot of uncertainty
about the validity of particular models.
VI. Some Concluding Observations

There has been a lot of progress in our understanding of the term
structure in the last twenty years. We now have formal heuristic theoretical

models of the term structure in terms of the ultimate objectives of economic
agents and the stochastic properties of forcing variables. These models are
beginnings that have changed our way of thinking about the term structure.

We have now an extensive empirical literature describing in great detail how
the term structure is correlated with other economic variables. But we could
hope for still more progress.
It is of course very difficult to say where the actual opportunities
for productive research lie, but it is possible to say where there are
problems to be solved.

Theoretical work on the term structure, while it has offered many
insights, still does not allow us to say much about the term structure we
observe. Most theorists are currently using a representative individual
utility of consumption model, while most corporate and government bonds in
the United States are held by institutions. Even if institutions were
somehow behaving as if they were representative consumers, we must face the
fact that the expected present value of utility of consumption model has not
held up well in tests of the returns on assets other than bonds. Probably,
the theoretical model is just not a good descriptor of human behavior.

Most of the theoretical work on the expectations hypothesis has worked
on the term structure of index bonds, but freely tradable true index bonds

60

of varying maturity are virtually nonexistent. The theoretical literature
has tried to find justifications for a zero term premia model, while the
assumption of zero term premia has never been an issue for empirical
researchers. That term premia are not zero and change through time has not
suggested any well-posed problems for theoretical researchers working in the
current paradigm that would produce any idea as to how to expect them to
change.

Empirical work on the term structure has produced consensus on little

more than that the rational expectations model, while perhaps containing an
element of truth, can be rejected. There is no consensus on why terni premia

vary. There does not seem even to be agreement on how to describe the
correlation of the term premia with other variables. A lot more research
could be done leading to consensus on, for example, the senses in which long
rates may be influenced by government fiscal policy, term premia are related
to some measures of risk, interest rates overreact or underreact to short
rates, or be influenced by or depend on rules of thumb or "satisficing"
behavior. Flow of funds models have some interest, but seem to have been
largely dropped by researchers in the wake of the rational expectations
revolution, just when they should have been integrated with it.

Appendix II.

U. S. Term Structure Data, 1946.8760
J. Huston McCulloch

The three tables which follow summarize the term structure of interest
rates on U.S. Treasury securities from December 1946 to February 1987.
Table 1 shows the zero-coupon yield curve on an annual percentage,

continuously compounded basis. This yield curve is inferred from the prices
of whole securities, rather than being based on the recently developed (but

much less liquid) market for stripped Treasury securities. In Shiller's
notation, this is 100 rd(t, t-+-m), as used in his (1).

Table 2 shows the instantaneous forward rate curve on the same annual

percentage, continuous compounding basis. This curve shows the marginal
return to lengthening an investment in rn-year zeroes by one instant. The
zero coupon yield for maturity in is the unweighted average of these forward
rates between 0 and in.

In

Shiller's notation, these forward rates are 100

f(t, t+m), as used in his (7).

Table 3 shows the par bond yield curve, again on an annual percentage,

continuously compounded basis. This is defined as the (unique) coupon rate
that would make a bond of maturity in be quoted at par, and gives a precise

meaning to the ambiguous conventional concept of a "yield curve" for coupon
bonds. The par bond yield for maturity in

is

a weighted average, with

Sciences Economiques et Commerciales (ESSEC), Cergy, France, on Professional Leave

83

declining weights, of the forward rates between 0 and m. The tabulated

values are essentially 100 r(t t+m), as used in Shiller's (3).
These values were computed by fitting the discount function that gives

the present value of a future dollar to Treasury security prices. This
discount function (pd(t, T) in Shiller's nomenclature) was curve fit with a
cubic spline, as described in McCulloch (1975b), and as modified at NBER-

West during l97778.61
Briefly, the data sets include most of the marketable U.S. government

bills, notes and bonds. Closing bid and asked quotations for the last
working day of the month indicated, as reported in dealer quote sheets or

the next day's Wall Street Journal, were averaged. These observations were

given weights inversely proportional to the bid-asked spread. Callable
bonds were treated as if maturing on their call dates, if currently selling
above par, and as if running to final maturity, if currently selling below

par. "Flower bonds" (redeemable at par in payment of estate taxes if owned
by the decedent at the time of death) could not all be eliminated, as they
constituted the bulk of the observations for many maturities during the

earlier part of the period. Accordingly, they were selectively eliminated
during these years if the estate feature appeared to be active. For further

6l. NBER version fits the actual "flat" price to the sum of the values of
the individual payments. This is slightly more accurate than the version I
developed at the Treasury in 1973 and described in McCulloch (l975b), which fit
the "and interest" price to an idealized continuous coupon flow. McCulloch (1971)
contains further background information on this procedure.
In only one instance prior to March 1986, namely the zero-maturity rates for
May 1958, did the cubic spline indicate a negative interest rate, of -0.11%. This
value was not significantly negative, however (its estimated standard error was
0.54%), and so it was replaced with a zero in the tables. The zero at m — 0 for
May 1947 is the actually estimated value. Since March 1986 forward rates in the
range 27 to 29 years have often been negative, but these maturities are beyond the
range of the tables.
84

details see McCulloch (1981, 229-30). Since August, 1985, callables are not
used.

During the early 1970's, a legislative ceiling on the interest rates
the Treasury could pay on long-term debt effectively prevented the issue of

new bonds. As existing bonds approached maturity, the longest available
maturity therefore fell to under 15 years, so that values over 10 years are

occasionally missing during this period. The longest available maturity
sometimes also fluctuates by five years from month to month if the longest

securities are callable and hovering near par. Since the cubic spline does
not lend itself to extrapolation, this methodology cannot be used to infer
longer term interest rates than those shown.62
The curve-fitting procedure was adjusted for tax effects, as described

in McCulloch (l975b). The capital gains advantage on deep discount bonds
could not be ignored during the earlier part of the period, when most of the

long-term bonds were heavily discounted. The importance of this adjustment
greatly diminished after 1969, however, when the tax laws were changed so
that commercial banks were required to treat capital gains and losses

symmetrically. After this date, the best fitting apparent marginal tax rate
generally was much lower than before, and was often less than lO%63
The par bond yields in Table 3 are based on hypothetical continuous-

62The exponential spline approach proposed by Vasicek and Fong (1982) has the
considerable virtue of making such as extrapolation meaningful. Chen (1986) has
implemented the VF approach along with a modification proposed by the present
author, with mixed preliminary results; the forward curves are better behaved at
the long end, but often the restrictions implicit in the VF model and in the
modified model can be formally rejected with a likelihood ratio test.
should be noted that the identity (9') holds for the values in Table 3,
but only using the discount function that applies to after-tax payments. Cf.
Shiller's footnote 13.
