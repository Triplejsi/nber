Price Risk, Production Flexibility, and Liquidity Management: Evidence from Electricity
Generating Firms

ABSTRACT
Production inflexibility together with product price uncertainty creates price risk, which is a
potentially important factor for firms’ liquidity management. One industry for which price risk
can be measured is the electricity producing industry. We use data on hourly electricity prices in
41 markets to measure fluctuations in output prices and information on over 60,000 power plants
to approximate firms’ flexibilty to vary output quantities. Our results suggest that higher
electricity price volatility leads to increased cash holdings, but only in firms using inflexible
production technologies. This effect is robust to a number of specification choices including
instrumenting for volatility in electricity prices using weather forecast data. After deregulation,
firms hold 20-25% more cash, suggesting that the process of deregulation increases the risk
firms’ face. Price risk affects cash holdings most in financially constrained firms, and in firms
that cannot easily hedge the electricity price through derivative markets. Capital market liquidity
and balance sheet liquidity appear to be substitutes for one another.

1. Introduction
One source of risk facing many firms is price risk. Price risk occurs when firms with inflexible
production face uncertainty about the market price of their products. For instance, if firms must decide on
the production volume before knowing the exact demand for their product, they will face costs when they
have to alter production. The magnitude of these costs depends on the nature of the production process:
the more inflexible the production process is, the higher the ex post cost of altering production and hence
the higher the ex ante price risk.1 For this reason, price risk can potentially be an important factor in
firms’ liquidity management decisions.
An industry for which price risk is both relevant and empirically measurable is the electricity
generating industry. In many parts of the world, this industry has been deregulated. In deregulated
electricity markets, electricity producers sell their product on a wholesale market to electricity retail firms,
who then distribute it to the consumers. Because generation capacities are fixed in the short-run,
wholesale prices fluctuate considerably when demand for electricity changes, which often occurs because
of changes in weather or seasonal factors. Since storing electricity is prohibitively expensive, electricity
prices tend to fluctuate much more than prices in other commodity or financial markets. Consequently,
generating firms have to adjust production in response to demand changes, which often entails the
shutdown and later restart of plants. Depending on the method used to produce electricity, shutdowns and
restarts of plants can take considerable time, and such disruptions to production can be very costly for
producers. For this reason, price fluctuations and the associated uncertainty create risk for energy utilities,
especially those using inflexible production technologies such as coal-fired power plants.

Discussion of price risk dates to the classic paper by Sandmo (1971), and the idea that flexibility in production
affects its magnitude comes from Turnovsky (1973) and Epstein (1978).

This paper measures the extent to which price risk affects the liquidity management decisions of
electricity producing companies. It considers a sample of 481 electricity-generating firms between 1999
and 2014. These firms operate more than 60,000 individual plants, which use technologies ranging from
wind power to coal to nuclear power, and represent the vast majority of publicly traded electricity
generating firms in the world. In most of our empirical tests, we focus on the 253 firms that sell electricity
in organized markets in which retail firms purchase electricity from the wholesale market. In 41 regional
markets from 30 countries, we are able to obtain the hourly wholesale prices received by our sample firms
during our sample period. 2
However, price uncertainty is unlikely to create the same price risk for all electricity producing
firms. Rather, their production technology is likely to play a key role. Using data on firms’ power plants
to approximate how easy the can adjust production to changing prices, we analyze whether firms’
liquidity choices vary systematically with the price risk they face. Firms which operate flexible plants
such as gas-fired plants can quickly shut down these plants as soon as the price falls below their variable
cost. For less flexible plants like coal this is more difficult as the shut-down and restart typically requires
several hours and involves considerable cost. 3 To measure price uncertainty, we use data on hourly
electricity wholesale prices in a power market. These data allow us to estimate a firm’s price risk because
electricity producers sell most of the electricity in the market where the plant is located. 4 Hourly prices
are used instead of daily or weekly prices because power plants are dispatched within a day. For instance,
gas-fired power plants would be turned on as soon as the price increases above their marginal cost. Daily
prices average all hourly prices of a day and are thus less precise. 5 Based on these hourly prices, we
These are virtually all markets around the globe that operate a day-ahead market for electricity and have hourly
pricing. Section 2.1 provides an overview on the markets and the criteria for their inclusion.
3 Instead of shutting down a plant, the operator could also reduce its load. However, there are considerable technic al
limitations to this approach. For instance, operators of gas combined cycle and coal-fired power plants typically
limit the minimum generation to about 40% to 50% of its capacity. Furthermore, the efficiency of thermal power
plants decreases significantly for low load levels.
4 Selling in electricity to other markets is possible, but there are substantial technical (e.g., losses due to
transmission) and legal (e.g., market regulations) limitations. Based on geographical segment data, we estimate that
our sample firms sell more than 90% of their production in the market where they are located.
5 For instance, consider a daily average electricity price of 50 USD/MWh and a gas-fired power plant with variable
cost of 75 USD/MWh. To know whether this plant was switched on or not, it is necessary to know the distribution of
2

calculate the electricity price volatility during a firm’s fiscal year. We use the average volatility during the
whole fiscal year because cash holding decisions are typically not made on short-term (e.g., daily or
weekly) basis. We focus on firms’ cash holdings, since they are the most common way that firms adjust
the liquidity of their balance sheet. Because of the many institutional, tax, and cultural differences across
countries and markets, we include firm fixed effects in all equations we report, so that the results should
be interpreted as the way in which a particular firm changes its cash holdings in response to changes in
market conditions.
Our estimates suggest that firms with inflexible production do adjust their cash holdings in
response to changes in price uncertainty. For firms using relatively flexible technologies such as gas-fired
power plants, in which output can be adjusted very quickly and at little or low cost, we find little effect of
price uncertainty on liquidity management. However, firms using inflexible production technologies such
as coal react to changes in the volatility of wholesale prices changing the amount of cash they hold. These
findings suggest that firms do hedge price risk through liquidity management.
To isolate the channel through which price risk affects liquidity decisions, we rely on the fact that
electricity prices are heavily influenced by an exogenous factor – the weather. While electricity capacity
is rather fixed in the short-run and supply can be planned by energy utilities, electricity demand varies
considerably. One important determinant of electricity demand is the weather (Perez-Gonzalez and Yun,
2013). 6 Since adjustments in the electricity supply are costly and slow, demand changes due to
unexpectedly high or low temperatures lead to price fluctuations. We approximate such unexpected
weather events by deviations of actual temperatures from forecasted values, which lead to unexpected

hourly prices within the day. For a price of 50 USD/MWh for all hours, the plant would not run; for a price of 100
USD/MWh during 12 hours and 0 USD/MWh during the other 12 hours, the plant would run 50% of the time.
Similarly, consider a coal plant with variable cost of 30 USD/MWh. In the first scenario, this plant would be highly
profitable. However, in the second scenario, the plant would likely also produce despite a price below marginal cost,
which reduces its overall profitability.
6 In this context, Vattenfall, a large European energy utility, states that “[e]lectricity prices on the Nordic electricity
exchange, Nordpool, are 70 per cent governed by the elements.” (http://corporate.vattenfall.com/news-andmedia/news/2014/how-the-weather-affects-the-electricity-price/)

demand and increase the volatility of electricity prices. 7 Using this logic, we construct an instrument for
electricity price volatility based on how uncertain (or unpredictable) future temperatures are in a power
market and year. This instrument varies considerably between different regions and over time. 8
Instrumenting for volatility using this approach leads to similar findings to those discussed above: price
uncertainty increases cash holdings of firms with inflexible production technologies but not those with
flexible production technologies.
We perform a number of robustness tests to ensure that these results do not occur because of
arbitrary choices we have made in our empirical design. For instance, we use alternative proxies for
operational adjustment cost or alternative measurements for electricity price volatility (based on annual
prices). To mitigate concerns that our results are driven by a specific production technology (e.g., nuclear
power plants which are special along several dimensions), we reestimate our equations excluding all firms
that operate several specific technologies. To ensure that the results do not reflect the actions of energy
utilities who have market power and therefore can influence wholesale electricity prices, we reestimate
our equations without all firms that account for more than five or ten percent of the production capacity in
any specific market. All of these tests confirm the main finding that price risk coming from volatility in
wholesale prices is an important factor in electricity producing firms’ liquidity management decisions.
As originally argued by Keynes (1936), holding cash for precautionary reasons only makes sense
if there is some likelihood of a firm facing financial constraints in the future. Holding cash is costly for a
number of reasons, so if a firm can always borrow costlessly at the appropriate cost of capital, reliance on
the capital market should dominate holding cash. Therefore, we expect that if the results we present occur
because of firms hedging price risk by holding cash on their balance sheets, the effect should be larger for
firms likely facing financial constraints.

Ronald N. Keener, Senior Scientist of Duke Power Company states in this context that a “conservative annual
estimate of weather error costs associated with startup-shutdown of generation units is $8,000,000 for Duke Power.”
(http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/socasp/weather1/keener.html)
8 For time series variation, two effects are important. First, forecasting techniques are becoming more precise over
time. Second, the weather tends to be more extreme and unpredictable due to the climate change.

To evaluate this argument, we split our sample into subsamples of firms based on their production
flexibility. For each sub-sample, we then estimate how financial constraints affect the way in which firms
adjust their cash holdings in response to wholesale price volatility. We use four measures of financial
constraints: firm size (with smaller firms being more constrained), whether the firm has participated in the
syndicated loan market, whether a firm has a bond rating, and whether a firm is in a Common Law
country, since these firms tend to have superior access to financing through equity markets. The estimates
imply that for the subsample of firms with inflexible production, the impact of price uncertainty on cash
holdings is much more pronounced in financially constrained firms. However, for the subsamples of firms
that are not likely to be financially constrained, price uncertainty does not appear to affect firms’ liquidity
management decisions. These results suggest that, consistent with theoretical predictions, constrained
firms are more prone to manage price risk through their cash positions than unconstrained firms.
An alternative way to manage price risk is to pre-sell electricity through a liquid futures market.
In our sample period, the existence and liquidity of futures markets for electricity varied substantially
across regions. We reestimate our equation on subsamples of firms that are in regions with liquid futures
markets, and those in markets that either do not have a futures market, or have one that is relatively
illiquid. Our estimates suggest that the sensitivity of cash holdings to price volatility varies inversely with
the ability of firms to hedge their exposure to potential shocks through futures markets: if firms can easily
hedge shocks through derivatives, even those with low production flexibility have very small changes in
cash holdings following changes volatility. Since it is usually cheaper to hedge through the derivatives
market than by holding cash, firms appear to do so when such markets exist and are liquid. This result
highlights the way in which derivative markets are substitutes to liquidity management, and suggests that
a benefit of having liquid derivative markets is that they allow firms to hold less cash on their balance
sheets.
We evaluate whether firms build up liquidity reserves in response to price risk by restricting
payouts. Consistent with this idea, we find that price risk leads to lower payouts, both in terms of

5

dividends alone and also dividends plus share repurchases. Adjustments in payout policy seem to be one
way in which firm using inflexible technologies achieve higher liquidity in response to price uncertainty.
Finally we consider the extent to which price risk represents a cost of deregulation to firms. Since
firms hold more cash because of the wholesale price risk and holding cash is costly, the price risk
electricity producers face is potentially an additional cost of deregulation. As a direct test of this idea, we
compare the cash holdings of deregulated electricity producers and otherwise identical regulated ones.
Consistent with the notion that deregulation increases the risk faced by electricity producers, our results
suggest that firms selling on wholesale markets hold about 20-25% more cash than otherwise identical
firms in regulated markets.
Our analysis extends the literature in a number of ways. First, we measure the extent to which
electricity producers in deregulated markets adjust their cash holdings in response to the risk they face
from wholesale price movements. While there has been prior research documenting a relation between a
firm’s cash flow volatility and its cash holdings, measuring this relation is challenging. Most prior
literature uses accounting based measures that are only available at an annual frequency. In contrast, we
rely on micro data about the output prices faced by particular producers, which leads to a clean
identification of this relation. Second, the fact that we directly measure output prices rather than use firmlevel cash flow data allows us to identify the impact of uncertainty on cash holdings because we can
instrument for electricity price volatility by weather forecast uncertainty. Third, our detailed data on the
methods of producing electricity used by different firms enables us to measure the way in which price risk
depends on the inflexibility of the production process. Fourth, we use cross-firm and cross-country data
to evaluate the importance of the factors that potentially influence the importance of liquidity
management. In particular, we identify the way that greater access to equity and debt markets, as well as
the ability to hedge in liquid futures markets are substitutes for active management of the liquidity of a
firm’s balance sheet.

Fifth, we consider the way in which deregulation imposes risks on firms by

exposing them to wholesale price movements, which lead them to have to pay costs to adjust their

6

production decisions. We document the way in which firms compensate for this additional risk by
comparing the liquidity choices of otherwise similar firms in regulated and unregulated markets.
There has, nonetheless, been a substantial literature on liquidity management.

The most

prominent explanation why firms hold cash dates to Keynes (1936), who originally proposed that firms
hold cash as a hedge against potential future financial constraints. Opler, Pinkowitz, Stulz, and
Williamson (1999) was the first paper to examine this idea empirically, and started a literature that
generally concludes that the precautionary motive is an important determinant of firms’ liquidity
management decisions. 9
This paper also contributes to a long line of research about the economics of energy utilities.
Fabrizio, Rose and Wolfram (2007), for instance, analyze how efficiency of energy utilities is affected by
regulatory changes. Furthermore, Becher, Mulherin, and Walkling (2012) investigate corporate mergers
in the energy utilities industry, Perez-Gonzalez and Yun (2013) use energy utilities to disentangle the
value contribution of risk management with derivatives, and Rettl, Stomper, and Zechner (2016) measure
competitor inflexibility in this industry. Reinartz and Schmid (2016) analyze the impact of production
flexibility on the financial leverage in the electricity-generation industry. For this purpose, they also
construct flexibility measures based on the plants which are operated by firms. Reinartz and Schmid
(2016) focus on the impact of flexibility on leverage, whereas this paper analyzes how price uncertainty
affects cash holdings of firms with flexible and inflexible production.
This paper’s analysis suggests that a cost of delivering electricity through wholesale markets is
the risk that such markets expose firms to; since electricity producing firms are price takers in the
wholesale market, price fluctuations create risk they must manage, either through adjustment in their cash
positions or through the derivative markets.

2. Wholesale Price Fluctuations and Utilities’ Demand for Liquidity
2.1. The Wholesale Market for Electricity
Competitive wholesale markets for electricity exist in many countries. In these markets, the prices
for electricity adjust to reflect the supply and demand at a particular point in time. Consumers typically
pay a pre-arranged rate to their retail company. These retail companies, however, typically purchase
electricity they sell to consumers from the wholesale market at whatever the prevailing price happens to
be. The suppliers of electricity on the wholesale markets are electricity-generating firms, many of which
do not directly sell to final consumers. The Electricity Power Supply Association (EPSA) summarizes
that “[i]n many cases, electricity is generated by a power company that ultimately will not deliver it to the
end-use customer. A single megawatt […] is frequently bought and re-sold a number of times before
finally being consumed. These transactions are considered "sales for re-sale," and make-up the wholesale
electricity market.”10
Wholesale markets for electricity usually have a day-ahead market (DAM) in which market
participants buy and sell electricity for delivery on the following day. Thus, this market is essentially a
very short-term future market. The DAM typically features contracts for the delivery of electricity during
individual hours of the following day. 11 The price for electricity is formed independently for each contract
and thus for every hour. Some wholesale markets also offer real-time markets in which electricity for
delivery on the same day is traded. Because these markets are generally not very liquid, we focus on the
DAM in which most of the trading takes place.
Wholesale electricity markets have developed in different regions of the world, with (slightly)
different structures and regulations. In the U.S., the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)
order 2000, which was issued in February 2000, set the starting point for the creation of regional
wholesale markets for electricity. Independent system operators (ISOs) and regional transmission
organizations (RTOs) then formed market regions with day-ahead wholesale markets for electricity.
https://www.epsa.org/industry/primer/?fa=wholesaleMarket
We focus on markets for which hourly electricity prices are available. If a market uses half -hourly prices, we
define the hourly price as the average of the two half-hourly prices.

Currently there are seven organized markets in the U.S. These are ISO New England, New York ISO,
PJM, Midwest ISO, Southwest Power Pool, ERCOT, and California ISO. Whereas some of those markets
focus (approximately) on a single state (e.g., ERCOT covers most of Texas), others serve regions with
multiple states (e.g., PJM covers all or part of 13 different states). 12 According to EPSA, two-thirds of the
United States' economic activity occurs within the boundaries of these markets. States outside these
markets still do not have competitive markets for electricity, so in these states, electricity is still supplied
by regulated utilities.
In Europe, the process of deregulating electricity markets and introducing wholesale markets for
electricity was started in 1996 by the European Union Directive 96/92/EC. By the early 2000s, the
majority of all E.U. markets were deregulated. European markets are generally organized as day-ahead
markets, and most but not all wholesale markets in Europe cover one country. Nordpool, the largest
electricity market in Europe, is an important exception and covers several northern European countries.
In Asia and Oceania, the deregulation process varied across countries. Australia was an early
adopter and started introducing wholesale markets in the mid-1990s. It now has multiple markets, which
generally cover single states. There are no markets for which we are able to get data during our sample
period in South America and Africa.
Overall, we collect hourly electricity prices for 41 power markets located in 30 countries. We do
not consider markets which were active for less than two years during our sample period, markets without
day-ahead trading, and markets without hourly pricing. 13 Figure 1 illustrates the regions of the world that
supply electricity competitively through wholesale markets. These regions cover a large portion of the
developed economic world. However, while the basic structure of electricity markets is similar across the
globe, the markets differ in a number of ways. For this reason, we focus on time-series variation in the

For simplicity, we assume that a market exists in a state if it covers all or most of the state according to the FERC.
For this reason, we do not include the Southwest Power Pool (starting in 2013), IBEX in Bulgaria (2014), EPIAS
in Turkey (2015), and CROPEX in Croatia (2016). Furthermore, we ignore markets which do not feature a typical
day-ahead market with hourly pricing (WESM, Philippines). Hourly electricity prices could not be obtained for the
markets in Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia.

volatility of electricity prices in our empirical tests because of potential cross-regional differences that are
potentially difficult to control for econometrically.
2.2. Wholesale Price Risk and Production Flexibility
Price risk faced by electricity producers should vary as a function both of the market and also by
production technology. In some markets, demand for electricity is relatively stable and easy to forecast,
leading wholesale prices to be relatively stable.

However, in other markets, demand can fluctuate

substantially and be difficult to predict accurately. For example, a heat wave in Texas in early August
2011 led to an electricity supply shortage and boosted prices peaks of more than 2,000 USD per MWh
(the average price being around 30 USD per MWh). 14 In contrast, the electricity price went down to
around negative 150 USD per MWh in Germany in May 2016.15 The reason for this negative price was a
combination of higher than expected production by wind turbines and the inflexibility of other power
plants, which continued producing despite the negative price. Fluctuating wholesale prices impose
adjustment costs on electricity producers, since they cannot store electricity easily if prices are low, and
must pay setup costs to increase production if prices are high. Furthermore, because there is no way to
dispose of electricity costlessly, these firms have to sell all the electricity they produce, even if the price is
negative. Thus, wholesale price volatility creates a demand for liquidity from electricity producing
companies, since unforeseen price fluctuations impose incremental costs on these firms.
Electricity producing firms differ from one another in terms of their exposure to price risk,
because they face differences in regional demand fluctuations and also because their methods of
producing electricity have different costs of adjusting output. Since electricity producers sell their product
in the wholesale market, their revenues will vary with the price they receive in the wholesale market.
Because consumers’ demand for electricity tends to be price inelastic, a shock to demand can lead to large
changes in wholesale prices. Supply curves of electricity producing firms, in contrast, can be relatively
elastic, so changes in prices can lead firms to desire to adjust quantities substantially. Therefore, the

ability to adjust output quantities at relatively low cost in response to price movements can be very
valuable to electricity producers.
The cost to electricity producers of changing output varies dramatically with the method they use
to produce electricity. The average cost of adjusting output for each of the main technologies is
summarized in Table 1. Gas-fired power plants are very flexible, with run-up times of only several
minutes and a low cost for starting the plant. 16 Gas combined cycle power plants are also quite flexible,
with run-up times of about 90 minutes. However, for other production technologies the time needed to
stop and start the plants and the associated cost can be considerable. For example, lignite-fired plants need
about six hours to start at a cost of about 35 Euro per megawatt of production capacity, while coal-fired
power plants cost about 50 Euro per megawatt. The most inflexible technology is nuclear power, since it
can take days to shut down or restart a plant, with a very high cost of doing so (above 100 Euro per
megawatt).
The total cost associated with starting and stopping of plants to electricity producing firms can be
sizable. To gauge the magnitude of these costs, consider an average sized firm with 15 coal-fired plants.
The average capacity of a coal-fired plant is 750 megawatts and the cost of cycling a coal plant (stopping
and restarting it), is about $56 per megawatt, so each cycle costs about $42,000 per plant. If there are 50
cycles per year at each plant, the total cost is about $31.5 m annually per firm, which is more than 10% of
the annual net income for a typical firm in our sample. 17
The importance of production flexibility for energy utilities is highlighted by the existence of
negative electricity prices in many markets. In this context, the European Power Exchange states that
“[n]egative prices are not a theoretical concept. Buyers are actually getting money and electricity from

For wind and solar power, start costs and time are zero as these technologies are typically not actively dispatched
(we present a robustness test later which excludes these technologies to ensure that they do not bias our findings).
17 These cost estimates are for "warm starts", which means that the plant is not totally shut down. Costs for "cold
starts", in which the plant is completely shut down would be higher, but these events are much rarer. Estimates for
the number of warm start-ups of coal-fired plants varies slightly between different sources, but 50 is an average
estimate. For instance, the International Energy Agency estimates that a typical coal-fired plant has about 45 warm
starts per year (see Trueby, 2014, p. 19), whereas data from Aptech suggests more than 50 start-ups for coal-fired
plants (see Leyzerovich, 2007, p. 316).

sellers. However, you need to keep in mind that if a producer is willing to accept negative prices, this
means it is less expensive for him to keep their power plants online than to shut them down and restart
them later.”18 The fact that electricity prices are sometimes negative increases the value of being able to
adjust output at low cost, as well as the downside risk that firms with inflexible production face from
price volatility.
2.3. Empirical Implications
Uncertainty about future prices combined with high inflexibility creates price risk for electricity
producers. If the wholesale price changes substantially, then the optimal response of the suppliers would
be to move along the supply curve and adjust output accordingly.

However, it takes time to change

output, e.g., by shutting down a power plant, especially for firms producing electricity with inflexible
technologies. For this reason, an inflexible producer will be left producing a suboptimal quantity after a
demand shock for a period of time. Because it is costly to change output, inflexible suppliers sometimes
choose to produce a suboptimal quantity for limited periods of time rather than pay the costs of stopping
and restarting the plant. Regardless of whether a firm pays to shut down a plant temporarily or continues
to operate at a loss, the firm can suffer a cash flow shock when there are declines in the wholesale price.
The potential of such cash flow shocks provides a reason why electricity producers should use
liquidity management.

Almeida, Campello, Cunha, and Weisbach (2014) formally model a problem

similar to the one faced by electricity producers. In this model, the firm faces an uncertain cash flow
requirement to continue a valuable investment so holds cash in anticipation of the potential cash flow
shock. A clear implication of this model is that when the magnitude of a potential cash flow shock
increases, a firm should hold more cash in anticipation of a cash flow shock. This effect is lessened when
a firm has better access to capital markets or can hedge the cash flow shocks in other ways, such as
through a derivatives market.
For electricity producers, the potential cash flow shock arises from the risk coming from
uncertainty about the wholesale price of electricity when there is inflexibility in their production process.

When price uncertainty is low and/or production flexibility is high, such price risk is relatively
unimportant. However, when price uncertainty is high and the cost of adjusting production is high, price
risk is substantial, increasing the probability of negative cash flow shocks. Consequently, firms are
expected to hedge such price risk ex ante by holding more liquidity. In addition, we expect this hedging
via liquidity effect to be larger when firms are more likely to be financially constrained and when they do
not have access to derivative markets that can be used to hedge cash flow shocks directly.

3. Data Description
3.1. Sample of Electricity-Producing Utilities
To construct a sample of energy utilities from all over the world, we start by combining lists of
active and inactive utility companies from Thomson Reuters. We focus on publicly-traded utilities
because reliable data for unlisted firms is often not available. The sample covers the years 1999 to 2014,
which is the period for which we can obtain the necessary data on firms' production assets.
We perform several steps to clean the sample. First, we eliminate all firms without a primary
security classified as equity. Second, we wish to consider only companies that focus on the generation of
electricity. To ensure that other companies are not included, we rely on firms’ SIC and ICB codes, the
business description obtained from Capital IQ, and additionally conduct manual research on the
companies’ business lines. This process leads to a sample of 481 utilities for which we are able to obtain
data on production assets. For much of the analysis, we focus on the subsample of the 253 firms that are
located in regions that have wholesale markets for electricity during some portion of our sample period.
These firms are located in 33 different electricity markets and have a total of nearly 40,000 unique power
plants.
Table 2 provides a detailed overview of the composition of the sample over time. The number of
sample firms increases significantly over time. The main reason for this increase is that many regions
deregulated their electricity markets and created wholesale markets during our sample period.
3.2. Wholesale Electricity Price Data
13

To measure the degree of electricity price volatility, we use hourly data on electricity prices in
each market. These data are available for 41 regional markets from 30 countries. Most countries have
their own national market but some markets cover more than one country (e.g., Nordpool, which covers
several Northern European countries) and some countries have more than one market (i.e., Australia,
Canada, and the U.S.). We obtain the price data from the websites of the power exchanges, direct contact
with those exchanges, or from Thomson Reuters. To make the prices comparable across countries, all
prices are converted into U.S. dollars.
Table 3 provides descriptive statistics for electricity prices in each market. It is evident from this
table that there is substantial variation across the world in electricity prices. Prices are highest in markets
in Japan and Singapore, which have to import resources to produce electricity. In each of these markets,
the mean and median wholesale prices are around $100 per megawatt hour. In contrast, prices in the
Russian wholesale market, which has abundant energy resources, average about one fifth of this level,
$22 per megawatt hour.
To illustrate that there are consistent differences across markets, we present in Figure 2 a time
series plot of electricity price times for one month (January 2012) in three selected markets: the German
market, the Italian market, and Nordpool, which covers several Northern European countries. This figure
indicates that the degree of fluctuations varies considerably between different markets and over time.
Even though all three markets are for developed European countries, the Italian market consistently has
higher price than the German market’s price, which is in turn higher than the price in Nordpool.
Since our goal is to evaluate the way in which wholesale price fluctuations affect firms’ liquidity
management, we calculate a measure of the price fluctuations in a particular market. To do so, we first
match all sample firms to electricity markets based on their geographical location. We calculate a measure
we refer to as VOLATILITY, which equals the standard deviation of returns of hourly electricity prices
during a firm’s fiscal year. Daily prices, which are simply aggregations of hourly prices because the

14

hourly contracts are those which are typically traded, are less precise than hourly prices for our purpose. 19
Returns are calculated as differences between hourly prices in U.S. dollar and standardized by the average
price in a market.

Table 2 presents statistics on VOLATILITY in each market. This measure of price

volatility varies substantially across markets, with an average of .05 for Russia, .08 for Nordpool, and
over 2 for the Australian markets.20
3.3. Measuring Production Flexibility
Our measures for production flexibility are based on the generation technologies of the sample
firms’ power plants. Data on the production technologies for single power plants is obtained from the
annual versions of the Platts World Electric Power Plant database. This comprehensive database contains
information on power plants and their technologies around the globe. It includes information on single
power plant units, including their production technologies, capacities, geographic locations, start dates of
commercial operation, and their owners/operators. 21
We obtain this database for all years between 2000 and 2014 and manually match each power
plant in this database to the energy utilities sample. 22 About 50% of the plants match to our sample firms;
the remainder are owned by large utilities that are not publicly listed and are excluded from our sample
for this reason. These data on production processes allow us to calculate the degree of production
flexibility for each firm in each year.

For example, assume a daily price of 100 USD. If the price was 100 USD for all hourly contracts, it would have
been optimal to run coal-fired plants in all hours. However, if the price was zero for 12 hours and 200 for the other
12 hours, switching on and off the plant would have been the optimal strategy. These two c ases cannot be
distinguished when using daily prices. Nevertheless, we perform a robustness test with daily prices and find similar,
but slightly weaker results (which is to be expected due to the loss of measurement precision).
20 An alternative approach is to use longer time intervals to calculate volatility, since the decision to shut down
plants is presumably made for longer than hourly periods. We construct measures for daily and annual volatility
below in section 4.4.1 and the results using these measures are similar to those using hourly volatility.
21 A detailed description of the database is provided by Platts’ Data Base Description and Research Methodology
(www.platts.com/IM.Platts.Content/downloads/udi/wepp/descmeth.pdf). Reinartz and Schmid (2016) contain
additional information about it as well as other information about electricity markets.
22 We use the yearly version of the database because they only include the current owner/operator. For 1999, we use
the database version of 2000 but exclude all power plants that were started after 2000.
19

15

Based on these data, we follow Reinartz and Schmid (2016) and use RUN-UP TIME as a measure
of production flexibility for a particular firm-year. RUN-UP TIME is calculated as the capacity-weighted
average run-up time:

with index i for firm, t for year, k for production technology and M for the number of different
technologies. The technology specific values for run-up time and their sources are summarized in Table 1.
We define FLEXIBILITY as one minus the normalized RUN-UP TIME (i.e., the run-up time divided by
the maximum value of RUN-UP TIME). This measure for flexibility is bounded between zero and one,
with higher values being associated with greater production flexibility. 23
3.4. Financial variables
Our measure of cash holdings is calculated as total cash holdings of the firm divided by book
value of assets. Control variables included in all models are size (measured as the natural logarithm of
total assets), cash flow (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization scaled by total
assets), and GDP (the natural logarithm of the GDP per capita).24 In additional tests, we also control for
several other possible determinants of cash holdings, such the market-to-book ratio (market capitalization
divided by the book value of equity), capital expenditures (scaled by total assets), leverage (total debt
divided by the sum of total debt and book value of equity), and dividend payments (a dummy variable
which equals one if a divided is paid). Fiscal years that end between January and June are allocated to the
previous year; only complete fiscal years are considered. To restrict the impact of outliers, all financial
variables are winsorized at the 1% and 99% levels.
3.5. Descriptive statistics

In robustness tests, we use alternative measures for production flexibility based on ramp-up cost, full-load hours,
and a relative ranking of all production technologies.
24 All financial variables are measured in U.S. dollars. Both the measure of cash holdings and the control variables
have become standard in the literature on cash holdings since Opler, Pinkowitz, Stulz and Williamson (1999).
23

16

Table 4 shows the descriptive statistics for our sample firms, averaged for the whole sample
period. On average, energy utilities have cash holdings equal to eight percent of their total assets. This is
comparable to values reported for multi-industry samples (see Almeida, Campello, Cunha, and Weisbach
(2014)). Furthermore, there is considerable variation in the cash ratio with an inter-quartile range of nine
percentage points. The average firm in our sample has total assets of around 18 billion USD (median: 4
billion USD). The average electricity price is 56 USD per megawatt hour (MWh), with 25th and 75th
percentiles of 33 and 68 USD per MWh, respectively. The average value of VOLATILITY is 0.36, with
considerable variation as indicted by the standard deviation of 0.76. The average run-up time is 3.7 hours
with a standard deviation of 5.1, while FLEXIBILITY has an average value of 0.91. Our sample firms
contain an average of 235 different power plants and use 6 different production technologies.

4. Estimating the Impact of Price Risk on Utilities’ Liquidity
4.1. Empirical Specification
To measure the impact of price risk on utilities’ liquidity management decisions, we estimate the
extent to which utilities’ cash holdings reflect price risk coming from wholesale price uncertainty and the
inflexibility of the production process. As emphasized by Duchin, Gilbert, Harford and Hrdlicka (2017),
this variable includes holdings of a number of securities, some of which are risky. Firms do, of course,
have other ways managing liquidity; for example, they can acquire lines of credit, build debt capacity, or
hedge through derivatives markets.

We focus on cash holdings for two main reasons. First, cash is

straightforward to measure and has been the focus of the prior empirical literature. Second, there are
theoretical reasons why cash is the preferred way of managing liquidity. Lines of credit and debt capacity
can disappear during poor financial conditions when they are most needed, effectively being used to fund
overinvestments in good times rather than efficient investments in poor times (see Acharya, Almeida and
Campello (2007) or Almeida, Campello, Cunha, and Weisbach (2014)). Hedging price risk by pre-selling
electricity in the OTC or futures markets is common in many markets; we address this possibility and
analyze how it affects our findings below in Section 5.2.
17

We estimate equations predicting an energy utility’s cash holdings. We use the measures of price
volatility and production flexibility we discussed above as our primary independent variables. Because of
cross-sectional differences caused by firm-level, country-level, and market-level factors, we include firm
fixed effects in all equations. The inclusion of these firm fixed effects implies that the important variation
in the data determining our estimates are time series changes undergone by individual firms rather than
differences across firms. We include year fixed effects to control for factors that affect the entire industry
at any point in time. Finally, we include the firm’s log (assets), its cash flow (normalized by assets), and
GDP per capital (in 2010 USD) in each equation. 25
4.2. Estimates of the Way Wholesale Price Volatility and Production Flexibility Affect Cash Holdings
We present these estimates in Table 5. The results presented in Column (1) suggest that higher
wholesale price volatility is associated with higher cash holdings, while higher production flexibility
leads to lower cash holdings. This pattern is consistent with theoretical predictions because both higher
price volatility and lower production flexibility are associated with higher price risk. When production is
more flexible, the cost of adjusting output is lower, so utilities with more flexible production approaches
hold less cash on their balance sheets.
Theoretically, according to a model such as Almeida, Campello, Cunha, and Weisbach (2014),
what should affect liquidity choices is the expectation of cash requirements. This expectation equals the
product of the likelihood of a required cash inflow with the quantity of the required cash inflow
conditional on one being needed. The likelihood of a cash inflow requirement is a function of the
uncertainty of wholesale prices, and the size of any potential cash flow shock is a function of the
inflexibility of the production process used. Therefore, we expect that the magnitude of each of these
variables will affect the impact the other has on liquidity. In other words, utilities that have a high price
risk due to both inflexible production methods and high product price uncertainty should adjust their cash

The reported t-statistics are based on cluster-robust Huber/White standard errors (White, 1980), clustered by
countries.
25

18

holdings more in response to an increase in price volatility than utilities with more flexible production
methods.
To evaluate this hypothesis, we split the sample in two subsamples based on the flexibility of the
production process used. In Column (2) of Table 5, we reestimate our equation on the subsample of
observations for which FLEXIBILITY is above the median value in a country and year, and in Column (3),
we reestimate the equation on the subsample in which FLEXIBILITY is below the median in a country and
year. The results suggest that impact of price volatility on cash holdings comes primarily from the sample
of firms with relatively inflexible production technologies. The coefficient on volatility for the subsample
of firms using flexible production technologies is very close to zero; for those firms using inflexible
technologies, it is much larger and the difference between the two is statistically significant. The positive
impact of volatility on cash holdings appears to be driven by firms with inflexible production
technologies. In contrast to flexible firms, these energy utilities cannot easily adjust their production in
case of adverse price shocks. Because of the possibility of an unexpected cash flow shock, these firms
build up liquidity buffers if the electricity price is highly volatile.
This pattern suggests that the appropriate specification of our model includes a term interacting
price volatility with our measure of production flexibility. In Column 4 of Table 5, we present estimates
of the equations including this interaction term and in Column 5 we reestimate this specification with
additional control variables.

In each specification, the estimated coefficient on the interaction term is

negative and statistically significantly different from zero.
The estimated magnitude of this effect is substantial. According to the estimates presented in
Column 5, a one-standard deviation increase of the electricity price volatility would translate into an
about five percentage-point increase (in absolute terms) of the cash to total assets ratio for the most
inflexible firms. Since the average cash ratio in our sample is 0.08, this increase represents a more than 50
percent change in relative terms. For a firm with average flexibility, a one-standard deviation increase in
volatility would go along with a 0.6 percentage-point increase of the cash ratio, nearly a ten percent
relative change. These calculations emphasize the importance of production flexibility, since the impact
19

of high wholesale price volatility on an electricity-producing firm’s cash holdings is much more
pronounced for firms using inflexible methods of producing electricity.
In addition to these statistical analyses, we also plot the relationship between electricity price
volatility and cash holdings in Figure 3, separately for all firms, firms with high production flexibility,
and those with low flexibility. Here, electricity price volatility is set to zero for firms in regions without
wholesale markets for electricity. For all firms, we find a clear correlation between cash holdings and
price volatility. When looking at the sub-samples of firms with high and low production flexibility, we
find that this comovement is driven by firms with low production flexibility. Thus, this graphical analysis
confirms the implications of the estimated regressions: inflexible firms react to an increase in price
volatility with higher cash holdings.
4.3. Identifying the Equation Using Weather Uncertainty as an Instrument for Price Volatility
The estimates in Table 5 are all based on firm-fixed effects estimations and thus are based on
variation of wholesale price volatility over time rather than across firms. While it is unlikely that one
firm’s financial policies can have a major impact on the volatility of wholesale price volatility, it is
conceivable that electricity price volatility in a market could be correlated with other time-variant country
factors, such as economic growth expectations. If these factors affect firms’ production flexibility at the
same time, they could lead to correlation between volatility and the residuals in the estimated equations.
To address such concerns and to identify the impact of price risk on firms’ liquidity policies more
cleanly, we exploit the fact that electricity prices are heavily influenced by an exogenous factor – the
weather. One of the most important factors influencing electricity demand is the temperature. Energy
utilities typically apply sophisticated temperature forecasting models and plan electricity supply
accordingly. 26 Since adjustments in the electricity supply are costly and slow, electricity prices react with
an increase in volatility if uncertainty about future temperatures is high and temperature forecasts change
frequently. Thus, electricity price volatility should increase if temperatures are difficult to forecast.
Because energy utilities use sophisticated weather forecasting techniques, measures based on deviations of actual
temperature from historical averages are unlikely to have a strong effect on price volatility. Expected temperature
changes also lead to price changes, but these changes are less pronounced compared to unexpected demand shocks.
26

20

Using this logic, we construct an instrument for electricity price volatility based on how
unpredictable future temperatures are in a power market. We obtain data on historical weather forecasts
from Intellovations, and consider all 3-day forecasts for various locations in the U.S., which are available
between 2005 and 2014. 27 We do not obtain only an aggregated forecast, but also individual forecasts
from six different forecast providers. Based on these data, we construct the variable WEATHER
FORECAST UNCERTAINTY. We start by calculating the forecast error for each forecast provider for
each location on each day, defined as the squared difference between the forecasted and actual average
temperature at a specific location. To measure the uncertainty of forecasts, we then calculate the standard
deviation of these temperature forecast errors across different forecast providers. Lastly, we calculate the
average of this standard deviation for each market and year. High values of WEATHER FORECAST
UNCERTAINTY imply that there is high uncertainty among forecast providers about the future weather,
so that it is difficult to estimate future electricity demand precisely.
We present estimates of the equation using this instrument for firms with low flexibility in Panel
A of Table 6, and those with high flexibility in Panel B of Table 6. First, we estimate a simple firm-fixed
effects regression with the uninstrumented volatility variable in Column (1) as baseline model. As before,
we find a positive effect of volatility on cash holdings for the subsample of firms with low production
flexibility. As a next step, we replace volatility with WEATHER FORECAST UNCERTAINTY and find
similar results in Column (2).
In the last two columns, we conduct an instrumental variables analysis. For WEATHER
FORECAST UNCERTAINTY to be a valid instrument for electricity price volatility, it must be unrelated
to the residuals in the equations predicting firms’ cash holdings but correlated with electricity price
volatility. The weather is clearly exogenous to any firm-level decisions. 28 To evaluate whether it is related
to electricity price volatility, we estimate a first stage regression, in which we predict electricity price

A comprehensive time series of weather forecasts is only available for the U.S; forecasts for most other countries
start in 2012, and coverage is much weaker than for the U.S. Thus, we focus on the U.S. markets in this test, using
more than 10 million daily temperature forecasts to construct the instrument.
28 Except possibly those involving the firm’s CO emissions.

volatility as a function of WEATHER FORECAST UNCERTAINTY. Estimates of this equation, reported in
Column 3, indicate that WEATHER FORECAST UNCERTAINTY clearly predicts movements in
electricity price volatility (with K-P rk Wald F statistics of above 20). Therefore, because WEATHER
FORECAST UNCERTAINTY is exogenous but correlated with electricity price volatility, it appears to be
a valid instrument. In Column (4), we analyze the impact of volatility on cash holdings using the
instrumented values for volatility. As in the specifications reported in Table 5, we find a strong and
positive impact of variations in the electricity price and firm liquidity for firms with low flexibility that is
virtually the same magnitude as in the fixed effect specification in Column 1. Overall, this finding
suggests that the relation changes in electricity price volatility occurring because of weather uncertainty
causally affect a firm’s liquidity management decisions.
4.4. Robustness
We have argued that electricity-producing utilities face risk coming from uncertain wholesale
prices they receive for their electricity and inflexible production. This price risk can lead to negative cash
flow shocks, so firms hold more liquidity in response to this risk. We have provided evidence suggesting
that firms do adjust their liquidity in this fashion. We now present a series of tests designed to ensure that
these results are robust to alternative specifications, definitions of variables, and other choices we have
made in designing our empirical tests.
4.4.1. Measurement of Volatility
The measure we use for the volatility of electricity prices is based on hourly electricity prices. An
alternative approach would be to use daily or annual prices instead of hourly prices. Daily prices are the
average of all 24 hourly prices within a day. Although they are less precise than hourly prices because
they ignore hourly variation (which can be a very important factor for start/stop decisions of power
plants), we use them as robustness test. Annual prices reflect long-term changes in the cost of electricity,
but cannot be used to calculate the volatility within a firm’s fiscal year because there is only one price
observation per year. Thus, we estimate the volatility of electricity prices as the standard deviation of the
returns from the previous four years. These data have the advantage of providing a more long-term
22

perspective on price volatility, although they are measured at much longer intervals so cannot capture
short term changes in price volatility.29
In Columns (1) and (2) of Table 7, Panel A, we present estimates of the main equation using
measures of price volatility constructed using daily and four years prior annual data on electricity prices.
Although the measurement of volatility is very different from that in the equations presented above, the
results are similar. Higher volatility still leads to higher cash holdings and this effect is concentrated in
firms using inflexible approaches to producing electricity. Our results do not appear to depend on any
particular approach we use to measure electricity price volatility.
4.4.2. Measurement of Flexibility
Our main flexibility measure is based on the run-up time of a particular technology, which
measures how long it takes to restart a power plant. In Columns (3) and (4) of Table 7, Panel A, we apply
two alternative measures of production flexibility. The first is based on a relative ranking of the
technologies flexibilities based on run-up time. Higher rank values are assigned to more flexible
technologies so that a higher value of this measure indicates more production flexibility. These
technology-specific values for ranking are summarized in Table 1.
The second alternative flexibility measure is based on ramp-up cost, which is an estimate of the
cost for a hot start of a power plant (in Euro per megawatt). A higher ramp-up cost indicates less
production flexibility. The estimates of ramp-up cost are also summarized in Table 1. Similar to our main
flexibility measure which is based on run-up time, we first calculate the capacity weighted average rampup cost for a firm and year, normalize it by dividing it by its maximum value, and then calculate the
flexibility proxy as one minus the normalized ramp-up cost.
The estimates of the equations using these alternative approaches to measuring production
flexibility are similar to the ones presented above in Table 5. In each estimated equation, higher volatility
leads to higher cash holdings and that this effect is concentrated in inflexible firms.
The data on annual electricity prices is obtained from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) for U.S. states
and from the International Energy Agency (IEA) for all other countries.
29

23

4.4.3. Sensitivity to Particular Technologies
One potential concern is that the differences we observe across technologies do not reflect the
differences in flexibility, but instead occur because of one or two particular technologies that are different
for some reason. For example, nuclear power is likely to contain risks not present with other technologies
that could lead firms using nuclear power to have more liquid balance sheets, although it is not clear why
those risks would lead to a relation between cash holdings and price volatility. Furthermore, the cost
structures of nuclear power plants are opaque because cost for the final deposition of nuclear waste are
often unclear and difficult to consider. Nonetheless, in Panel B of Table 7, we reestimate our equation
excluding individual technologies to ensure that the results are general and are not driven by the
idiosyncrasies associated with any particular technology. In Columns (1) to (4), we exclude all firm years
that have at least one plant with the following technologies: nuclear, coal, and gas. Another possible
concern is that certain types of power plants are not actively switched dispatched (i.e., switched on and
off). In particular, wind and solar plants produce electricity whenever there is wind or sun with little
active dispatching of such power plants. To a smaller extent, this concern also applies to hydro power
plants. To analyze whether such not actively dispatched power plants bias our results, we exclude all
firm-years of utilities operating any of these three technologies in Column (4). The results are similar to
those in the main specification in Table 5. Thus, it does not appear that the use if any particular
technology is driving our results. Regardless of which firms are included into the equation, their liquidity
decisions appear to be a function of both the price volatility and the flexibility of the production
technology.
4.4.4. Other Alternative Specifications
In Panel C of Table 7, we present several additional specifications to evaluate the robustness of
our empirical results. First, we replace our main measure for liquidity (cash holdings scaled by total
assets) with the natural logarithm of cash holdings scaled by total assets. The estimates using this
alternative dependent variable are presented in Column (1) and are very similar to our main specification
in Table 5.
24

In Columns (2) and (3), we only consider observations of firms that account for less than 10% or
5% of the market’s total capacity. It is possible that if firms have a large market share, they can
manipulate the wholesale prices and could potentially not be price takers in this market. In the subsample
used to estimate this equation, the average firm accounts for only 2.5% (median: 1%) of the market’s total
capacity, so is unlikely to have power to influence prices. The estimates in this equation are nonetheless
similar to those reported above. In Column (4) we exclude small energy utilities operating fewer than 25
power plants. None of these alternative specifications changes the results substantially.

5. Cross-Sectional Differences
5.1. Financial Constraints
As Keynes (1936) originally pointed out, liquidity management and financing constraints are
fundamentally linked. If financial markets work as well as most models in the finance literature assume
they do, firms’ liquidity decisions would be irrelevant. However, if financial markets contain frictions
making it costly for firms to issue debt or equity, liquidity management becomes important. In the case of
electricity production, this logic implies that it should be more important for firms to hedge price risk
through liquidity management when firms are more financially constrained.
We evaluate the extent to which the relation between firms’ cash holdings and price risk varies
with the financial constraints facing the firms in our sample. To do so, we construct four measures of
financial constraints: firm size (with smaller firms being more constrained), a dummy variable indicating
that the firm has issued a syndicated loan, a dummy variable indicating that the firm has a bond rating,
and a dummy variable that indicating if the firm resides in a common law country (which is likely to be
related to access to equity financing).30 As before, we split the sample into high and low flexibility firms
and interact our measure for volatility with a dummy variable which equals one for the subset of firms
that are less likely to face financial constraints and zero otherwise.

30

We find similar results using other measures of access to equity capital such as the anti self-dealing index.

25

The estimates are reported in Columns 1-8 of Table 8. They suggest that regardless of the
measure we use to construct the subsamples, the impact of electricity price volatility on cash holdings in
firms using inflexible methods of producing electricity is much more pronounced for the financially
constrained subsamples (i.e., small firms, those without syndicated loan issuances, those without a bond
rating, and those with worse access to equity financing). For firms using inflexible technologies, price
volatility does not affect cash holdings regardless of whether the firms are likely to face financial
constraints. This pattern suggests that the extent to which firms change their liquidity in response to
wholesale price volatility varies dramatically with the costs firms face in accessing capital markets. The
dependence of the observed relation between corporate liquidity and price volatility on access to financial
markets provides support for the view that the relation that we have documented does reflect the
precautionary motive for holding cash.
5.2. Hedging through Derivatives Markets
An alternative to holding cash as liquidity is to hedge directly using derivatives. Derivatives can
substitute for cash holdings because they transfer cash flows to the states of the world where they are
most valuable (Froot, Scharfstein and Stein, 1993).

However, derivatives are imperfect substitutes

because they only allow firms to hedge risks for which appropriate markets exist, and the use of these
markets for hedging is limited by their liquidity.
In the case of electricity markets, the relevant markets are the futures or forwards markets, in
which firms can sell part of their output in advance. Doing so at least partly protects them from
fluctuations in the day-ahead spot market. However, hedging opportunities vary substantially across
power markets: some markets have very liquid electricity forward and/or future trading, while it is
difficult to hedge price risk in other markets. For instance, a report by the Economic Consulting
Associates (2015) on European electricity forward markets and hedging products “found weaknesses in
liquidity in many forward energy markets with only Austria, Germany and the Nordic area exhibiting
high levels of churn” (p. VII).

26

To evaluate the importance of derivative markets on liquidity management decisions, we again
divide the sample into firms with high and low flexibility and interact volatility and evaluate the extent to
which the existence of a liquid derivatives market exists affects the relation between price volatility and
cash holdings in each subsample. We manually classify each power market as having a liquid derivatives
market or not based on multiple sources. First, we use the percentage of a country’s annual electricity
demand that is traded in hedging products (i.e., forward or futures) as proxy for the availability of hedging
products. Data for this proxy is available for European countries from a report by the Economic
Consulting Associates (2015). Furthermore, we are able to collect the necessary information for this
dimension for the Australian markets from an OECD report (“Infrastructure to 2030”) and for New
Zealand from the market operator. Second, we use information from a survey among market participants
that was conducted for the European Commission. 31 Data on this measure is only available for European
countries. Lastly, we collect information on the availability of hedging products from industry reports,
newspaper articles, or publications by the operators of the power markets or electricity exchanges. 32
We present estimates of these equations in Columns (9) and (10) of Table 8. We find that
volatility affects cash holdings in inflexible firms much more when firms have poor hedging
opportunities. When liquid derivative markets exist, firms can more easily sell their electricity in advance
and hedge the risk coming from price fluctuations. However, if derivative markets do not exist or if they
are not sufficiently liquid, then firms change their cash holdings in response to volatility changes. This
finding provides direct evidence that hedging through derivatives markets is a substitute for holding cash.
5.3. Payout Policy

In this survey, active market participants were asked to rate the ability to trade forwards as “weak,” “moderate,” or
“strong” (see “Review and analysis of EU wholesale energy markets”, 2 nd July 2008).
32 For instance, neither of the two previous measures is available for PJM, but there is strong evidence that the
trading of forwards and futures is quite liquid for this market. Thus, we would set the general liquidity of PJM to
high. Classifying markets this way, we define markets to have a liquid hedging derivative product are AMEO NSW,
AMEO QLD, AMEO VIC, AESO, APX UK, CAISO, EPEX Switzerland, EPEX Germany, EPEX France, ERCOT,
EXAA, IESO, ISO New England, MISO, Nordpool, NYISO, OTE, and PJM. Markets without liquid hedging
products according to our classification are AMEO SA, AMEO WA, ATS, BELPEX, EMC, EMI, GME, HUPX,
IEX, JEPX, KPX, NP LITHUANIA, OMIE PORTUGAL, OMIE SPAIN, OPCOM, and TGE.
31

27

The results to this point suggest that electricity-generating firms adjust their cash holdings as a
function of price risk due to uncertainty in the power price and inflexible production. However, it is not
clear from these results exactly how the utilities go about adjusting their output. One possibility is that
the utilities make adjustments to their payouts as a way of managing their cash balances.
We evaluate the extent to which firm manage their liquidity through adjustments through payout
policy. To do so, we estimate equations predicting utilities’ payouts as a function of VOLATILITY and
FLEXIBILITY, as well as the interaction of the two. We also include firm-level control variables that
potentially also explain payouts, and firm and year fixed effects. The firm fixed effects imply that even
though the dependent variable in the equations is the level of payouts, they measure the level relative to
the firm’s average payout over the sample period. Consequently, the equations measure the effect of the
independent variables on the abnormal payout level for the firm in question.
We present estimates of this equation in Table 9. This table includes four columns, each of which
contains estimates using a different dependent variable: the natural logarithm of total payouts (dividends
plus share repurchases), total payouts normalized by the firm’s market capitalization, the natural
logarithm of dividends, and dividends normalized by the firm’s market capitalization. In each column,
the coefficients have the opposite sign from those predicting cash holdings in Table 5: higher price
volatility decreases payouts, and the positive coefficient on the interaction term implies the negative
effect of volatility in payouts comes primarily from firms using inflexible technologies.

The fact that

payouts decrease in exactly the same circumstances as when liquidity increases suggests that the two
effects are related. These results are consistent with the view that the changes in utilities’ liquidity due to
changes in price risk come from adjustments to their payouts.

6. Deregulation as a Source of Risk
The results we have presented suggest that electricity producing firms’ cash holdings change with
the volatility in wholesale prices, especially when firms use a relatively inflexible technology to produce
the electricity.

The implication of this result is that volatility in wholesale prices leads to volatility in
28

electricity-producing firms’ cash flows that they compensate for by holding additional cash. Presumably,
if the price electricity producing firms received were either constant or a function of the firms’ costs, then
they would choose to hold less cash, since holding cash is tax disadvantaged in most countries and creates
potential agency problems. Under deregulation, electricity-producing firms sell in the wholesale market,
and must bear price risk they do not have to bear in a regulated environment. This risk leads electricity
producing firms to add liquidity to their balance sheets, the cost of which should be considered when
making regulatory decisions.
An implication of this view is that producing firms that operate in deregulated markets should
face more risk, and consequently hold more cash, than otherwise similar firms who operate in regulated
markets.

This prediction can be tested in our sample, since of the 452 electricity-producing firms for

which all the necessary data is available, 213 change from regulated to deregulated markets during our
sample period, and the remaining 253 are in regulated or deregulated markets for the entire sample period.
Using the larger sample of both regulated and deregulated firms, we reestimate the equation presented
throughout the paper. We include a dummy variable Market equal to 1 if the firm sells its electricity in a
wholesale market in a particular year, and 0 otherwise. Estimates of this variable measure the incremental
cash held by deregulated firms relative to otherwise similar regulated ones. 33
We present estimates of this equation in Table 10.

In Column 1, we present the basic

specification without country and firm fixed effects and in Column 2, we include country fixed effects. In
Column 1, the estimated coefficient on Market is .018, and in Column 2 it is .015, each of which is
statistically significantly different from zero. Since the mean cash holdings (normalized by assets) is .08,
this equation implies that deregulation leads to about a 20% increase in firms’ cash holdings.

Because most markets were deregulated in the late 1990s and early 2000s, we use 1995 as the starting year for this
test. Furthermore, electricity wholesale markets typically require some time to become fully functional, we exclude
the start year and the year thereafter. For this test, we use the start year of the wholesale market in each country. In
most cases, this corresponds to the start year of the wholesale price data as summarized in Table 3. For some
countries, the wholesale market started before the data on prices became available. Brazil, Chile, and Colombia
started a market during our sample period, but electricity price data for these markets is not available.
33

29

In Column 3, we include firm fixed effects to control for factors that vary by firm or country.
With firm fixed effects, Market is perfectly correlated with the fixed effects when firms are either
deregulated or regulated throughout the entire sample period. Consequently, in this specification, Market
is identified from the firms that switch from being regulated to deregulated in our sample period. In this
fixed effect specification, the estimated coefficient on Market equals .02, slightly larger than the
coefficient in the specification without firm fixed effects.

This coefficient implies that having to sell

electricity through a wholesale market leads firms to increase cash holdings by 25%. Finally, in Column
4, we include Flexibility and Flexibility interacted with Market into the equation. 34 The estimates in this
equation also imply that having a market increases firms’ cash, and presumably the risk they are exposed
to. It also suggests that the impact of a market on firms’ cash holdings is larger for firms with inflexible
production technologies, for which it is more costly to adjust their output in response to price movements.

7. Conclusion
One of the most important decisions a financial manager must make concerns the liquidity of the
firm’s balance sheet. Holding cash is costly for tax and other reasons, while at the same time it can
insulate the firm from the obligation to raise external capital should there be an unexpected cash shortfall.
We evaluate firms’ decisions to hold cash by isolating one specific source of risk faced by firms in one
industry: the risk faced by electricity producing firms when electricity wholesale prices are volatile and
their production is inflexible.
We estimate the extent to which firms’ balance sheets vary with the potential price risk they are
likely to face. Our analysis makes use of variation in hourly wholesale regional electricity price data to
measure the likelihood that firms will desire to change the amount of electricity they produce, and of data
on firms’ power plants to measure the flexibility of the firms’ production processes. We focus on firms’
cash holdings, since cash holdings are the easiest way that firms can adjust the liquidity of their balance
sheet.
34

We use flexibility values as of 2000 for years prior to 2000.

30

Our estimates imply that firms’ cash holdings are positively related to both demand fluctuations
and the cost of adjusting production. Firms operating in markets with more volatile prices and firms with
more inflexible production technologies for which altering output is costly, tend to hold more cash. In
contrast, electricity price uncertainty has little impact on firms’ cash holdings if their production
flexibility is high. This pattern is consistent with the view that firms’ liquidity choices reflect the expected
costs of price risk.
To isolate the channel through which wholesale electricity price volatility affects producing
firms’ liquidity choices, we rely on the fact that movements in electricity prices often occur because of
weather-induced demand shocks. We construct an instrument for electricity price volatility based on the
uncertainty of future weather, and reestimate the equations predicting electricity producing firms’
liquidity choices using instrumental variables. Instrumenting for volatility this way, we find the same
pattern as when we use our baseline firm-fixed effects models for estimation: price volatility leads to
changes in cash holdings, with this relation much stronger for firms using methods of production for
which it is more difficult and costly to change output quantities.

This result suggests that price risk

causally affects firms’ cash policy in the manner suggested by the precautionary theory of liquidity.
We evaluate several cross-sectional predictions of the precautionary theory of liquidity
management. A key assumption underlying the precautionary theory is that it is costly to access financial
markets. Therefore, we expect that the dependence of liquidity on changes in price volatility will be
stronger for firms that have a higher cost of external finance and are likely to be financially constrained.
Using four alternative measures of the cost of external finance, our results imply that regardless of the
measure we use, firms’ changes in liquidity in response to changes in price risk are substantially larger for
firms more likely to be financially constrained.
In addition, the ability of firms to hedge price risk through futures or forward markets by selling a
portion of their electricity in advance through the derivative market varies across countries. The ability to
hedge in this manner is potentially a substitute for holding liquidity. Empirically, we find that, consistent

31

with this argument, the existence of a more liquid futures or forward market in electricity reduces the
impact of price risk on firms’ liquidity choices.
To understand the manner in which firms change their liquidity in response to demand shocks, we
estimate the way in which firms’ payouts respond to changes in price risk. The results imply that the
factors that lead firms to increase their liquidity are exactly the opposite of those that increase payouts;
payouts increase with reductions in volatility with this effect larger for firms with inflexible production
processes. This finding suggests that one way in which firms change their liquidity is through changes in
their payouts.
Wholesale price volatility appears to increase the risk faced by electricity producers, who
compensate by holding more cash on their balance sheets.

This additional risk faced by electricity

producers is a consequence of the deregulatory environment. As a test of this idea, we compare the cash
holdings of firms operating in regulated markets to those operating in deregulated ones. Consistent with
the notion that deregulation increases the risk faced by electricity producers, our results suggest that firms
selling on wholesale markets hold about 20-25% more cash than otherwise identical firms in regulated
markets.
Overall, our findings suggest that in the electricity producing industry, price risk can be an
important factor affecting firms’ liquidity choices. The flexibility of the production process is a major
factor affecting this risk. The electricity producing industry provides a useful laboratory for studying
liquidity management issues, since we can observe the production processes and output price volatility.
However, it is likely that price risk affects liquidity management choices in a similar manner in other
industries as well.
Our analysis highlights the fact that firms’ balance sheets are endogenous, and that economy or
industry level factors can affect them. In doing so, these factors can impose potentially substantial costs
on firms that have not been fully appreciated. First, deregulating the electricity industry had the effect of
forcing producers to face wholesale price risk, and compensate for this risk by holding more cash than
they otherwise would. The cost firms face from having to adjust their balance sheets is real effect of
32

deregulation that has not been fully appreciated. Second, the results emphasize an important implication
of more liquid capital markets; in particular, more liquid capital markets mean firms can hold less liquid
balance sheets. Since it is costly for firms to hold liquidity, when a country adopts policies that lower the
cost of external finance, a consequence is that firms in that country can hold less cash. Third, more active
derivative markets mean firms can hold less liquid balance sheets. Again, since it is costly for firms to
hold liquidity, the effects of liquid derivative markets on firms’ balance sheets is a social benefit of
having such markets.

Run-up time is measured in hours and refers to warm-starts in the
case of thermal power plants. The values for coal, gas-combined
cycle, lignite, and nuclear are based on Eurelectric’s “Flexible Generation: Backing-up Renewables”, p. 19. Danish Energy Agency’s
“Technology Data for Energy Plants” is the source for the values
of biogas, biomass, and waste. Information from life-cycle power
solutions provider Wärtsilä is used to calculate the run-up time for
oil. The values for hydro and pump storage power plants are based
on data from Duke Energy, FirstGen, MWH Global, and Liang and
Harley (2010). The run-up time for solar and wind is zero, as such
plants are usually not actively dispatched and start generation as
soon as sun or wind are available. Similarly, zero run-up time is
assumed for geothermal power plants.
Ramp-up costs are measured in USD per MW. The values for coal,
lignite, nuclear, gas combined cycle, and oil are based on Boldt et al.
(2012). Euro values are converted to USD based on the EUR/USD
exchange rate at the end of 2014. We assume that ramp-up costs for
gas power plants equal those of oil power plants and that ramp-up
costs for geothermal, hydro, pump storage, solar, and wind power
plants are zero. For biomass and waste power plants, we assume
equal ramp-up costs as for coal plants. For biogas, we assume same
cost as for gas combined-cycle.
Ranking is the relative ranking of all production technologies. The
least flexible technology has a rank of one. The ranking is based on
run-up time and ramp-up cost.

The dependent variable is cash holdings [wc02001] normalized by total assets [wc02999].
Volatility is defined as the standard deviation of hourly electricity price changes, normalized
by a market’s average electricity price level. Flexibility is defined as the one minus the
standardized run-up time of a firm’s power plants. The sample is restricted to firms with
a production flexibility which is higher (lower) than the median value in a particular year
and country in Column 2 (Column 3). The sub-samples do not sum up to the full sample
because the median firm in a market and year is not included. All models are firm fixed effects
regressions. Control variables are lagged by one year. T-statistics based on Huber/White
robust standard errors clustered by countries are presented in parentheses. ***, ** and *
indicate significance on the 1%-, 5%- and 10%-levels, respectively. A detailed description of
all variables can be found in Appendix A.

The dependent variable is cash holdings [wc02001] normalized by total assets [wc02999].
The sample for this test is restricted to U.S. firms with a production flexibility above the
median in Panel A and those with a flexibility below the median in Panel B. Weather
forecast uncertainty is the average standard deviation of the 3-day weather forecast error
across different forecast providers in an electricity market and year. Weather forecast error
is defined as the squared difference between the forecasted and actual average temperature
at a specific location. IV stands for instrumental variables regression. T-statistics based on
Huber/White robust standard errors clustered by countries are presented in parentheses.
***, ** and * indicate significance on the 1%-, 5%- and 10%-levels, respectively. A detailed

The base specification is as follows: the dependent variable is cash holdings [wc02001] normalized by total assets [wc02999]; volatility is defined as the standard deviation of hourly
electricity price changes, normalized by a market’s average electricity price level; flexibility
is defined as the one minus the standardized run-up time of a firm’s power plants.
In Panel A, volatility is calculated as the standard deviation of returns of daily prices in
Column 1 and annual prices (over the last four) in Column 2. Annual electricity prices in
USD are based on EIA and IEA data. The alternative flexibility measures are ranking and
ramp-up cost.
In Panel B, firm-years with plants using the technology specified in each column are excluded.
Control variables are lagged by one year.
In Panel C, the dependent variable is the natural logarithm of cash holdings scaled by total
assets in column 1. Only firms which account for less than 10% or 5%of the total production
capacity in a country/state and year are considered in Column 2 and 3. In Column 4, only
firms with more than 25 different power plants are considered. In Column 4, we exclude firms
which operate in more than one electricity market.
All models are firm fixed effects regressions. Control variables are lagged by one year. Tstatistics based on Huber/White robust standard errors clustered by countries are presented in
parentheses. ***, ** and * indicate significance on the 1%-, 5%- and 10%-levels, respectively.
A detailed description of all variables can be found in Appendix A.

All models are firm fixed effects regressions. Control variables are lagged by one year. T-statistics based on Huber/White robust standard errors clustered
by countries are presented in parentheses. ***, ** and * indicate significance on the 1%-, 5%- and 10%-levels, respectively. A detailed description of all
variables can be found in Appendix A.

In Columns 1 to 6, we use firm size, syndicated loans, and bond ratings to split firms in financially constrained and unconstrained firms. For firms
size, a firm is financially unconstrained if total assets are higher than the median total assets in a country and year. For syndicated loans, financially
unconstrained are those firms which have issued a syndicated loan during our sample period. We define a firm to be financially unconstrained if S&P
issued a long-term bond rating in the current or any previous year. In Columns 7 and 8, access to equity is high for countries with common law. Hedging
opportunities in Columns 9 and 10 is set to one if the liquidity of the market for electricity price hedging products is high and zero if the liquidity is
low or no such market exists. We classify each market based on multiples sources, such as newspaper articles, industry reports, or reports issued by the
exchanges. Furthermore, we use date on the annual volume of electricity futures/forwards relative to demand from the “European Electricity Forward
Markets and Hedging Products - State of Play and Elements for Monitoring” report by the Economic Consulting Associates and a survey for the European
Commission which investigates the ability to trade forwards.

The base specification is as follows: the dependent variable is cash holdings [wc02001] normalized by total assets [wc02999]; volatility is defined as the
standard deviation of hourly electricity price changes, normalized by a market’s average electricity price level; flexibility is defined as the one minus the
standardized run-up time of a firm’s power plants.

The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of 1 plus the total payout
amount (i.e., dividends [wc04751] plus share repurchases [wc05376]) in Column 1 and total payout amount scaled by market capitalization [wc08001]
in Column 2. Only dividends are considered in Columns 3 and 4. Volatility

The dependent variable is cash holdings [wc02001] normalized by total assets
[wc02999]. Market is a dummy variable which equals on if a wholesale market
for electricity exists in a region and year. The year in which a market is introduced and the first year thereafter are excluded because markets are frequently
not fully functional at the beginning. Flexibility is defined as the one minus
the standardized run-up time of a firm’s power plants. For years before 1999,
we use the earliest available flexibility value as approximation. Models are
pooled OLS or firm fixed effects regressions. Control variables are lagged by
one year. T-statistics based on Huber/White robust standard errors clustered
by countries are presented in parentheses. ***, ** and * indicate significance
on the 1%-, 5%- and 10%-levels, respectively. A detailed description of all
variables can be found in Appendix A.
