The Life Cycle of Scholarly Articles across Fields of Research

NBER Working Paper No. 23447

JEL No. B0
ABSTRACT
Aggregate citation behavior plays a key role in scientific knowledge diffusion, as citations document
the collective and cumulative nature of knowledge production. Additionally, citations are commonly
taken as input for several influential evaluative metrics used to assess researchers’ performance. Nevertheless,
little effort has been devoted to understanding and quantifying how article citations evolve over the
years following an article’s publication and how these trends vary across fields of research. By collecting
and analyzing a dataset consisting of more than five million citations to 59,707 research articles from
12 dissimilar fields of research, we quantify how citations evolve across fields of research as articles
grow older. Analyzing raw citation data spanning different periods poses several methodological challenges;
to tackle them, we employ quantile regression, a technique that makes it possible to control for citation
inflation (the fact that citations have become more common nowadays) and to take into consideration
the well-known asymmetry in the distribution of citations. We find that citations follow a life-cycle
pattern. In the first years after publication, articles generally receive a small but growing number of
citations until, eventually, they reach a peak from which they then decline. Importantly, the shape
of these life cycles varies greatly from one field to the next. Given that several influential metrics restrict
their input to a certain range in terms of the number of years since publication, these differences are
by no means neutral and should be taken into account when evaluating researchers or their institutions.

policymaking, as it is considered to be a key driver of
economic growth and prosperity [1, 2, 3]. When the
area of knowledge under consideration is narrowed
to that of scientific knowledge, interest is usually
centered on its flow within and between scientific
areas, which is traced through citations in scientific
publications [4, 5, 6]. In this sense, citations serve
to document the collective and cumulative nature of
knowledge production [7]. Citations also influence
knowledge creation and diffusion in a less direct, but
by no means negligible, way: many of the influential
metrics used to evaluate researchers and research
institutions are based on citation counts [8, 9, 10, 11].
This is a topic of debate and concern in the scientific
community, and opposing views regarding the issue
are held [12]. On the one hand, proponents of the use
of citation counts argue that metrics, if correctly used,
provide transparency and objectivity in evaluating
researchers’ performance. On the other hand, there
is also a widespread perception that metrics can be
manipulated and that their use crowds out valuable
qualitative reviews.

Aggregate citation behavior plays a key role in scientific knowledge diffusion, as citations document the collective and cumulative nature of knowledge production. Additionally, citations
are commonly taken as input for several influential evaluative
metrics used to assess researchers’ performance. Nevertheless,
little effort has been devoted to understanding and quantifying
how article citations evolve over the years following an article’s
publication and how these trends vary across fields of research.
By collecting and analyzing a dataset consisting of more than
five million citations to 59,707 research articles from 12 dissimilar fields of research, we quantify how citations evolve across
fields of research as articles grow older. Analyzing raw citation
data spanning different periods poses several methodological
challenges; to tackle them, we employ quantile regression, a
technique that makes it possible to control for citation inflation
(the fact that citations have become more common nowadays)
and to take into consideration the well-known asymmetry in
the distribution of citations. We find that citations follow a
life-cycle pattern. In the first years after publication, articles
generally receive a small but growing number of citations until, eventually, they reach a peak from which they then decline.
Importantly, the shape of these life cycles varies greatly from
one field to the next. Given that several influential metrics
restrict their input to a certain range in terms of the number
of years since publication, these differences are by no means
neutral and should be taken into account when evaluating researchers or their institutions.

One of the main reasons for the widespread use
of bibliometric indices is that, once citation data are

number h such that the researcher being evaluated
has published h articles such that each of them is
cited h or more times [13, 14, 15]. The n-year journal
impact factor, for any given year, is defined as the
average number of citations received by papers published in the journal during the n preceding years
(typically, n equals 2 or 5 years) [16, 17, 18]. In terms
of computation, the first index involves sorting authors’ articles in ascending order by the number of
total citations and checking which one is the last one
for which a simple condition is satisfied, whereas
the second involves calculating a simple arithmetic
mean.

values of these indices. Furthermore, it is not clear
how these dynamics vary across different fields of
research or how they are affected by citation inflation. For example, for a metric that excludes citations
coming from articles that are older than 2 or 5 years,
disciplines in which articles receive most of their
citations in the first few years after publication may
be perceived as more influential or important than
disciplines in which article citations take longer to
reach a peak. The fact that these patterns are not
well understood suggests that caution should be
used when comparing researchers across disciplines
or even when comparing researchers who are at different stages of their careers. In this study, we help
to fill this gap by identifying, analyzing, and quantifying annual trends in citations as articles grow
older. In doing so, we place a strong emphasis on
the analysis of differences across a broad range of
disciplines and across articles having different levels
of success (as measured by citation counts).

Even though calculating these metrics from citation data is an easy task, citation behavior (i.e., the
data generation process) is a complex phenomenon
[19] which is influenced by many factors besides scientific merit (understood in terms of quality or relevance). Among these various elements, two stand
out. First, citations are presumed to be influenced
by field-dependent factors. For example, in some
fields, recent papers are cited more frequently than
in some others [20], and literature in relatively small
and isolated fields attracts fewer citations than more
general papers do [19, 21]. Second, citation activities are also influenced by time-dependent factors.
Concretely, as the number of publications in peerreviewed journals steadily grows [22], and as newer
articles tend to cite more sources than older ones
[23], citations have become more common from year
to year. Following [23] and [24], we refer to this
phenomenon as citation inflation.

Results
To arrive at our results, we collected detailed Google
citation data on more than five million citations spanning 59,707 research articles and 12 fields of research
(astronomy & astrophysics, biochemistry, biology,
economics, finance, mathematics, medicine, physics,
political science, psychology, sociology, and statistics). As detailed in Materials and Methods, an important and distinctive feature of our analysis is that,
when sampling these articles, we took special care
to obtain a representative sample of articles across
fields of research, time, and level of success.
To place our results in context, we first show
that, at the stock level (i.e., considering total citation
counts), citation counts vary greatly across fields of
research. Then, we show how raw annual trends in
citations vary across these fields. In doing so, we
make explicit the importance of taking into account
citation inflation and skewness in the distribution
of citations. Finally, and taking into consideration
both of these issues, we present our estimates of the

Surprisingly, even though citation behavior is regarded as an important issue, little effort has been
devoted in either studies on scientific knowledge
diffusion or the evaluative bibliometric literature to
understanding and quantifying how article citations
evolve as articles grow older. The importance of
these trends is by no mean negligible, given that, as
citation indices usually restrict the range of articles
that they use as input on the basis of the number
of years that have passed since their publication, annual trends in citations may strongly influence the

for medicine compared to biology or physics. For
medicine, an article published in the period 19851999 received little more than five citations per year,
on average, in its peak year, while, for the period
1995-1999, in its peak year it received almost three
times more citations. On the other hand, in the fields
of biology and physics, the peak in citations per year
did not vary as much, but the newer articles tended
to age better (i.e., the decay in annual citations was
less pronounced). Second, the fact that mean citation
curves for any given period lie at higher values than
the curves for median citations signals the existence
of a strong positive skewness in the distribution of
citations per year. Note that this asymmetry in the
distribution of citations is common to all fields of
research and persists as the papers age. Nevertheless, the strength of this trend also seems to differ
across fields. Let us consider, for example, the case
of psychology and biochemistry as compared to biology, medicine and economics. In psychology and
biochemistry, the mean estimates are as much as double the median values, while, in biology, medicine
and economics, the mean estimates are more than
quadruple the median ones.

and conducting inference about conditional quantile functions. Just as ordinary least squares (OLS)
regressions estimate models for conditional mean
functions by minimizing sums of squared residuals,
quantile regression estimates, through analogue minimizations, models for conditional median functions,
as well as for a full range of other conditional quantiles. Using QR to estimate the life cycles of research
articles offers several advantages. First, QR is more
robust than OLS to the presence of skewness in the
response variable distribution and to outliers. Second, by introducing dummy variables representing
the year in which citations were received, estimates
can be controlled for citation inflation. Third, estimating conditional quantiles of a response variable
distribution makes it possible to examine not only
the life cycles of “typical” or “central” articles, but
also those of articles having different levels of conditional success.
Concretely, using QR and the collected citation
data, for each field of research we fit the following
regression model:
ci,t (τ ) = β 0 (τ ) +

∑ β s (τ ) It,s + ∑ γy (τ ) Ii,t,y + ei,t (τ )

Life-cycle of scholarly articles across
fields of research
Annual citations are presumed to have a life-cycle:
after publication, articles begin to be read and cited;
eventually, the number of citations reaches a peak, after which it declines (probably because newer papers
supplant the older articles). Associating articles’ life
cycles with raw citation trends, such as the ones presented in Fig. 2, is misleading, however, owing to the
effect of citation inflation. Moreover, the skewness
in the distribution of annual citations also suggests
that associating life cycles with average values for
citations may introduce a bias in the results.
In order to address both of these issues, in this
study we identify the life cycles of research articles by means of quantile regression (QR) [25, 26].
QR is a regression technique used for estimating

where ci,t stands for citations of paper i at age t
(years since publication, which range from -2 to 15).
The set S contains integers ranging from -2 to 15
except for 0 (which we set as our base category for
years since publication). It,s is an indicator variable
that takes the value 1 if t equals s and 0 if not.2
The set Y contains integers ranging from 1986 to
2015 which represent the calendar year in which
citations were received. (Note that this specification
leaves 1985 as our base category.) Ii,t,y is another
indicator variable that takes the value 1 if year t is

equals 10, thereby neutralizing the effects of any coefficient β s (τ )

As many bibliometric indices are especially sensitive to highly successful articles (e.g., total number
of citations, average number of citations per paper,
journal impact factors), understanding the dynamics
of highly cited articles is also important in order to
better understand the potential drawbacks associated with the use of these indices. In Fig. 4, we
present the estimated life cycles obtained by using
the specification presented in Eq. 1 for the 0.85 and
0.95 percentiles of the conditional distribution of the
annual number of citations. Detailed estimated coefficients are presented in SI Appendix, Tables S1-S12.
Fig. 4 shows that, even for highly successful research articles, a life-cycle pattern is observed in
all the disciplines covered by this study. Moreover,
this figure again points to differences across disciplines. It is notable that, for disciplines which have
a sharp peak in annual citations (i.e., astronomy &
astrophysics, biochemistry, biology, medicine and
physics), the shape of the estimated life cycles remains quite constant relative to those presented in
Fig. 3, with the major difference being that, in Fig. 4,
these peaks represent higher annual citation values.
This does not seem to hold for disciplines such as
economics, finance, political science, sociology, and
statistics, where highly successful articles not only
reach higher peaks, but also seem to reach those
peaks later than in the other disciplines mentioned
above.

range of disciplines. In addition, these patterns tend
to vary greatly across different fields of research.
Social sciences such as economics, political science,
and sociology exhibit longer life cycles, with annual
citations of articles tending to reach a peak later on
than in other disciplines and then declining after this
peak quite gradually. Mathematics and statistics articles display a somewhat similar pattern, although
the number of citations per year is much lower than
in the case of the social sciences. In addition, in a
number of fields, article citations are much more
concentrated in the first years after publication. This
is the case for astronomy & astrophysics, biochemistry, biology, medicine and physics. As filtering
articles by their age is a common practice when calculating evaluative metrics, these differences are by
no mean neutral and should be taken into account
when evaluating researchers or research institutions.

Data collection
As a first step in quantifying citation trends, we
had to select which fields of research we would analyze. With the aim of covering a broad range of
patterns in citation trends, we chose fields of research in the social sciences, life sciences, physical
sciences, mathematical studies, and health studies.
Specifically, we analyzed articles from the following
disciplines: astronomy & astrophysics, biochemistry,
biology, economics, finance, mathematics, medicine,
physics, political science, psychology, sociology, and
statistics.
For each of these twelve fields of research, we
chose five prestigious journals from which to sample articles. We restricted our selection to general
research journals within each field or to sets of journals that, taken together, cover a wide range of topics within each area of research (as in the case of
the physics journals that we selected). Our criteria
for inclusion were that the journals had to be well
known and be high-impact publications within each
field and had to have high standards for acceptance.
To ensure that the selected articles accurately represented the field under consideration, we chose to
exclude multidisciplinary scientific journals such as
Science, Nature and Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences. To guide our search, we made use of publicly available journal rankings such as the Scimago
Journal & Country Rank (www.scimagojr.com) and
the Eigenfactor Score (www.eigenfactor.org). SI Appendix, Table S13 lists the selected journals by field of
research.
For each of the 60 journals that we selected, we
downloaded data on all the research articles published from 1980 up to 2004 from Thomson Reuters’
Web of Science (WoS). The data included their titles,
authors, publication dates, journal volumes, and total WoS citation counts. From this population of
published research articles, we obtained a representative sample of articles using the following stratification scheme. First, for each field of research,

Analyzing the reasons for the existence of these
patterns is beyond the scope of this article. Of course,
the size of the different disciplines influences the
number of citations, as well as how much the discoveries made in each subject area transcend the fields
of research which generate them [24, 27]. Nevertheless, a factor that is not commonly mentioned
which might also affect these trends is time to publication. As an article is going to be cited by future
articles, if those articles take a long time to be published, citations will be a long time in coming. Previous research suggests that time to publication varies
markedly across fields [28]. For example, social science articles are known for having a long publication
lead time. As stated in [29], a business/economics article usually takes 18 months to be published, while
a physics article takes less than 10 months and an
article on chemistry generally takes 6 months. Mathematics and statistics articles also take a long time
to be published [30, 31], with mean times to publication in several journals being on the order of 20
months. We hope that future research will build on
these findings by focusing on the different factors
that shape citation patterns.
