ABSTRACT
Almost all of the literature about the growth of income inequality and the relationship between
skilled and unskilled wages approaches the issue from the production side of general equilibrium
(skill-biased technical change, international trade). Here, we add a role for income-dependent
demand interacted with factor intensities in production. We explore how income growth and trade
liberalization influence the demand for skilled labor when preferences are non-homothetic and
income-elastic goods are more intensive in skilled labor, an empirical regularity documented in
Caron, Fally and Markusen (2014). In one experiment, counterfactual simulations show that
sector neutral productivity growth, which generates shifts in consumption towards skill-intensive
goods, leads to significant increases in the skill premium: in developing countries, a one percent
increase in productivity leads to a 0.1 to 0.25 percent increase in the skill premium. In several
countries, including China and India, simulations suggest that the historical growth experienced
in the last 25 years may have led to an increase in the skill premium of more than 10%. In a
second experiment, we show that trade cost reductions generate quantitatively very different
outcomes once we account for non- homothetic preferences. These imply substantially less
predicted net factor content of trade and allow for a shift in consumption patterns caused by
trade-induced income growth. Overall, the negative effect of trade cost reductions on the skill
premium predicted for developing countries under homothetic preferences (Stolper-Samuelson) is
strongly mitigated, and sometimes reversed.

Introduction

Over the past three decades, the large increase in income inequality, especially between skilled and
unskilled workers, has led to a vast body of research aiming to explain these changes, often focusing
on the roles of trade and (or versus) skilled-biased technological change.1 Other recent work has
highlighted the role of several alternative channels in explaining these changes, such as trade and offshoring through Heckscher-Ohlin-type mechanisms,2 heterogeneous technology adoption across firms,3
changes in matching patterns between heterogeneous workers and firms,4 and quality upgrading encouraged by trade liberalization.5 While this significant body of work concentrates on the production
side of general equilibrium, there is a smaller literature that considers shifting patterns of demand
across sectors which require different types of skills.6 The source of these demand shifts are in some
cases modeled explicitly and in others simply taken as exogenous as the consequences of the shifts for
the skill premium are explored. Our paper fits with some of this demand-driven literature, though we
link characteristics of goods in consumption to characteristics of goods in production in a very explicit
way. We will first describe our approach, and then explain how it relates to other literature later in
the section.
In this paper, we illustrate how income growth and reductions in trade costs affect the skill premium
when preferences are non-homothetic. Our results rely on the correlation between income elasticity
in consumption and skill intensity in production across goods, shown to be very large in Caron, Fally
and Markusen (2014). This correlation implies that homogeneous productivity growth across sectors
is no longer neutral for the skill premium in general equilibrium. It implies that as countries get richer,
their consumers increase their relative consumption of goods which are more skill-intensive in their
production, thereby increasing the returns to skilled labor relative to those of unskilled labor. The
effect of trade cost reductions on the skill premium also differ when preferences are non-homothetic
and when income-elastic goods are more skill intensive, as they affect the factor content of trade and
interact with trade-driven income growth.
To quantify these mechanisms, our analysis proceeds in three steps. In step 1, we describe a model
of production, trade and consumption in general equilibrium. In step 2, we estimate the preference,
trade cost and technology parameters of the model. We take a cross-sectional approach which allows
us to identify the role of income in explaining shifts in consumption. In step 3, we simulate various
counterfactual equilibria to quantify and illustrate the impact of productivity growth and trade cost
reductions on the skill premium.
Before proceeding, it might be appropriate to emphasize that our methodology does not permit
a “horse race” between alternative theories of the skill premium mentioned above, and we make
no attempt to evaluate the relative contributions or lack thereof of alternative mechanisms. Our

conclusions are limited to the argument that the overlooked correlation between income elasticities
and skill intensities is likely an important contributor to understanding the skill premium, especially
for developing countries where standard trade theory offers quite different predictions.
The first step of our analysis is to develop a model combining non-homothetic preferences with a
standard multi-sector and multi-factor model on the supply side. Consumption patterns are derived
from “constant relative income elasticity” (CRIE) preferences as in Caron et al (2014) and Fieler
(2011). The supply-side structure is an extension of Costinot et al. (2012) and Eaton and Kortum
(2002) with multiple factors of production and an input-output structure as in Caliendo and Parro
(2012). The model can be used to derive first-order approximations of the response of the skill
premium to small changes in productivity and trade costs, with and without taking the demand for
intermediate goods into account. These approximations help develop intuition behind the mechanisms
and emphasize the role played by the correlation between income elasticity and skill intensity.
In a second step, we estimate preference, trade cost and technology parameters. Our estimations
rely on the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) version 8 dataset (Narayanan et al., 2012) for
2007, which comprises 109 countries with a wide range of income levels, 56 broad sectors including
manufacturing and services, and 5 factors of production including the disaggregation of skilled and
unskilled labor. This dataset is uniquely suited to our purposes, as it contains a consistent and
reconciled cross-section of production, input-output, consumption and trade data. However, the broad
categories of goods and services make it unsuitable for the discussion of issues related to product
quality and within-industry heterogeneity. We follow the same estimation method as Caron et al
(2014). We first estimate gravity equations within each sector, which allows us to identify patterns of
comparative advantage and construct price indexes across importers and sectors. We then estimate
consumer preferences, adjusting for these price differences. To account for endogeneity, we instrument
prices with indices which do not depend on domestic demand. This strategy allows us to estimate
and identify price and income elasticity parameters for a large range of sectors. Doing so is usually
complicated by the lack of consistent price and expenditure data as well as endogenous prices. We
find that per capita income plays a crucial role in determining demand patterns across countries and
sectors. Income-elasticity in consumption varies largely across goods and is highly correlated with
skill intensity in production, as documented also in Caron et al (2014), with an estimated correlation
close to 50 percent across all goods, and even higher if we exclude services.
In a third step, we use our estimates of preference, trade cost and technology parameters to
quantitatively illustrate the role of non-homothetic preferences, by comparing results to an homothetic
preference benchmark, with two sets of counterfactual simulations in general equilibrium. The first
set of counterfactual exercises aims to quantify the potential for growth in income to affect the skill
premium through shifts in consumption patterns. We simulate a homogeneous one percent increase in
factor productivity across all sectors. If this increase is uniform in all countries, homothetic preferences
imply that the counterfactual equilibrium should be identical to the baseline equilibrium in terms of
skill premium, consumption shares, trade and production patterns. However, with our non-homothetic
preference estimates, homogeneous productivity growth leads to an increase in the skill premium in

2

all countries in our dataset. Our results are very close to the first-order approximation provided in the
first step. They are driven by the strong correlation between skill intensity and income elasticity, which
induces a quantitatively large increase in the demand for skill intensive goods as per capita income
increases. The main mechanism in this counterfactual does not rely on trade and we obtain no sizable
difference between closed and open economy simulations, except for a few small open countries. The
results are also only slightly mitigated when we account for input-output linkages, since the industries
that are upstream of skill-intensive final demand industries tend to be skill intensive themselves.
We also simulate country-specific productivity growth based on historic rates. The magnitude of
the skill premium estimates coming out of the model suggests that this demand-driven mechanism
may have played a quantitatively important role in driving observed changes in relative wages7 . The
predicted increase in the skill premium is especially large in the developing world. For example, the
growth in income which occurred between 1990 and 2014 would have led to a 10% predicted increase
in the skill premium in China. This compares to the 40% increase believed to have occurred in China
between 1992 and 2006 (Ge and Tao Yang, 2009). The predicted increase is larger in many of the
least developed countries. In rich countries the effect is smaller, but not negligible: the mechanism
generates an increase in the skill premium which represents about 20% of the increase in the US over
that period (Parro, 2012). These findings are overall consistent with the fact that the observed skill
premium increases have generally been more important in developing countries during that period.
Our second set of counterfactuals examines how preferences affect the relationship between trade
liberalization and the skill premium. We simulate a one percent trade cost reduction, both uniformly
across all countries or to and from a given country. The impact of trade costs reductions depends on
export and import patterns across industries. The standard Stolper-Samulelson argument suggests
that in skill-abundant rich countries, the direct effect of trade costs reductions is to lead to an increase
in the relative demand for skilled workers. The reverse would occur in developing countries. Our results
suggest that the introduction of non-homothetic preferences into the model substantially moderates
this prediction: the benefits of trade for the unskilled workers of the developing world are smaller. We
highlight and quantify four channels through which non-homothetic preferences affect results.
The first channel reflects how non-homothetic preference affect predicted trade patterns and the
strength of the Stolper-Samulelson effect. With non-homothetic preferences, consumption and production patterns are more correlated, as rich and skill abundant countries are predicted to consume
more of the income-elastic and skill-intensive goods which they have a comparative advantage in producing. As documented in Caron et al (2014), this leads to less trade overall and relatively more trade
between countries which have similar levels of income per capita. The net factor content of trade is
thus smaller, which leads to a weakening of the Stolper-Samuelson effect and a weaker relationship
between trade cost reductions and the relative demand for skilled labor. Our results indicate this to
7

We emphasize that our discussion of the skill premium is strictly a counterfactual: we do not estimate the effect
of actual productivity changes on the skill premium nor do we assert that neutral technical change is a characteristic
of recent history. Previous research has emphasized the role of skill-biased technological change (Autor et al., 1998), as
well as outsourcing and competition from low-wage countries (Feenstra and Hanson, 1999). Our counterfactual does not
dispute the findings of this research, we just use it to help quantify the significance of our results.

be especially important for developing countries which are predicted to export less unskilled-intensive
goods and for which trade liberalization has a smaller depressing effect on the skill premium. The
opposite occurs to rich countries, but to a lesser extent.
A second channel highlights the income effect of trade. As trade costs decline, gains from trade
make countries richer. Similar to the effect productivity growth, consumption thus shifts towards
income-elastic and skill intensive goods. Simulations show that the trade-induced income effect is
quantitatively large in many developing countries and neutralizes a significant share of the remaining
Stolper-Samuelson effect on the skill premium. We also illustrate the role of input-output linkages
(which magnify our results) and general-equilibrium feedbacks (which mitigate our results), but we find
that these two channels only moderately affect the first two. Combined, these effects suggest that nonhomothetic preferences generate a higher skill premium for the same amount of trade liberalization.
The difference is most striking for developing countries, many of which see trade’s depressing effect
on the skill premium disappear altogether.
As noted earlier, there is a great deal of literature on the skill premium. Since we are not attempting
to run a horse race among approaches as also noted earlier, we will not review the large literatures
focusing on skill-biased technical change and standard Heckscher-Ohlin type trade mechanisms. These
models and results are clearly empirically important, but for the sake of exposition we instead focus
on work more related to our own.
In the international trade literature, Markusen (2013) theoretically identified the potential consumption - driven impacts on the skill premium which we quantify. In a stylized model, he postulates
that non-homothetic preferences and a possible correlation between income elasticity in consumption
and skill intensity in production would make neutral productivity growth increase the relative wage
of skilled workers. Caron, Fally and Markusen (2014) show that the correlation is empirically strong
and illustrate the consequences for trade patterns, trade-to-GDP ratios, and the missing trade puzzle.
Here, we examine and quantify the implications of this correlation for the skill premium.8
More generally, this paper is part of a renewed interest in non-homothetic preferences in openeconomy settings in the trade literature. Fieler (2011), Simonovska (2015), Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016) also incorporate non-homotheticities in consumption, adding to a literature initiated by
Markusen (1986), Flam and Helpman (1987), Matsuyama (2000) among others. While related to our
work in terms of non-homotheticity, these papers concentrate on issues other than the skill premium,
such as explaining trade volumes and patterns, and markups in relation to per-capita incomes. Matsuyama (2017) pushes this literature further by endogenizing the relationship between non-homothetic
preferences and differential productivity growth rates across sectors and patterns of specialization in
production.
Conversely, work on trade and the skill premium has mostly focused on the supply-side. Few
papers have confirmed Stolper-Samuelson effects for developing countries (e.g. Robertson 2004 for

Mexico, Gonzaga et al. 2006 for Brazil) which are often at odds with increasing wage inequality
that we observe in most countries (Goldberg and Pavcnik 2007). Most of the recent literature on
trade and the skill premium thus aims to explain why trade may lead to a larger increase on the skill
premium than suggested by the standard Heckscher-Ohlin model. Bustos (2011) proposes a mechanism
whereby access to foreign markets triggers the adoption of skill-biased technologies and provides
supportive evidence from Argentinian firm-level data. Burstein and Vogel (2016) also examine how
the heterogeneous effect of trade across firms influences the relative demand for skilled labor, and show
that this within-sector reallocation channel can be potentially much larger than standard HeckscherOhlin channels. Costinot and Vogel (2010) indicate that poor countries facing large demand for skill
intensive goods from rich countries might experience a positive effect of trade on the skill premium,
but do not examine this claim empirically. Cravino and Sotelo (2016) show that a reduction in trade
costs leads to a relative expansion of the service sector relative to the manufacturing sector when those
are strong complements. Since service activities are more intensive in skilled labor, this leads to a
larger increase in the skill premium.
Non-homotheticity in consumption also plays an important role in the literature on trade and
quality (e.g. Hallak, 2010, Feenstra and Romalis, 2014). If the production of higher-quality goods
requires relatively more skilled labor, the idea developed here can be applied to link the skill premium
to the demand for quality. Opening to trade with richer countries, as well as increasing income per
capita should both lead to increasing demand for higher-quality goods and an increase in the skill
premium. The link between quality and skill labor is present in the work of Fieler et al. (2016) who
examine the effect of trade liberalization in Columbia. They argue that opening to trade led to a
quantitatively important increase in the demand for skilled workers due to the increase in the quality
of goods being produced.
Since our model and approach rely on shifts in the composition of demand across sectors, at
least two papers that provide strong evidence for these shifts should be noted. In the literature
examining the source and consequences of structural change, Buera and Kaboski (2012) discuss how
productivity growth leads to an increase in the skill premium. They develop and calibrate a two-sector
model in which growth leads to a higher share of services that are more skill intensive. They do not
however estimate or quantify the role of non-homothetic preferences, nor do they discuss the correlation
between skill intensity and income elasticity beyond the two-sector approach. Our estimated income
elasticities tend to be larger for services sectors, but the correlation between skill intensity and income
elasticity holds even when we exclude services. Since it holds for traded goods, the correlation also
has implications for the composition of trade and can help us explain why trade has a smaller effect on
the skill premium in developing countries relative to standard models. A second paper is Johnson and
Keane (2013) who examine how sectoral shifts in consumption influence the demand for many different
types of labor. In particular, they document the importance of demand shifts across occupations, such
as the shift toward (heavily female) service occupations.9 However, Johnson and Keane (2013) do not

Parenthetically, they document a number of other facts that cast doubt on the proposition that skill-biased technical
change is the main culprit behind the skill premium.

model or explain these sectoral demand shifts, a primary purpose of our paper.
Finally, a growing literature examine the differential effect of trade on the cost of living across
workers and households within a country. This channel has been examined, among others, by Fajgelbaum and Kandelwahl (2016), Nigai (2016) and He and Zhang (2017).10 For most countries,
Fajgelbaum and Kandelwahl (2016) estimate that poor households gain relatively more from trade
through cost-of-living effects, while Nigai (2016) tends to find the opposite. He and Zhang (2017)
extend Fajgelbaum and Kandelwahl (2015) to allow for worker sorting across multiple sectors, and
show that the effect of trade on the cost of living can be quantitatively larger than the effects on
nominal income. While we acknowledge that cost-of-living effects matter for welfare, we focus here
on the channels through which trade (and growth) affects the skill premium in nominal terms.11 Our
approach is closer to the Heckscher-Ohlin tradition of multiple factors of production, so we can easily
analyze skilled versus unskilled wages and distinguish sectors by factor intensities, which is exactly
what we have in our data.
The rest of the paper is organized in three sections. We describe our theoretical framework in
Section 2, our empirical strategy and estimation results in Section 3, and the quantitative implications
for the skill premium in Section 4.

Theoretical framework
Benchmark Model set-up

The model closely follows Caron et al (2014) with the same non-homothetic preferences but a more
flexible production function in terms of skilled and unskilled workers.
Demand
The economy is constituted of heterogeneous industries. In turn, each industry k is composed of a
continuum of product varieties indexed by jk ∈ [0, 1]. Preferences take the form:
U=

where α1,k is a constant (for each industry k) and Qk is a CES aggregate:

See also Porto (2006) for Argentina, Faber (2014), Cravino and Levchenko (2016) for Mexico, Faber and Fally (2017)
for the US.
11
Our approach allows us to generate predictions of the change in the relative wage of skilled vs. unskilled workers
even if there is no available data on initial wages by skill category in most of the developing countries in our sample.
Adjusting for cost-of-living effects would instead require data on initial wages differences between types of workers and
the distribution within each type.

6

Preferences are identical across countries, but non-homothetic if σk varies across industries. If σk = σ,
we are back to traditional homothetic CES preferences.12
The CES price index of goods from industry k in country n is Pnk =

and is constant across countries.13

Production
We assume a constant-returns-to-scale production function that depends on several factors and bundles
of intermediate goods from each industry. We assume that factors of production are perfectly mobile
across sectors but immobile across countries. We denote by γhk the share of the input bundles from
industry h in total costs of industry k (direct input-output coefficient), and each input bundle is a
CES aggregate of all varieties available in this industry (for the sake of exposition we assume that the
elasticity of substitution between varieties is the same as for final goods). We denote by wf n the price
of factor f in country n. Total factor productivity Zik (jk ) varies by country, industry and variety.
Labor inputs, comprised of unskilled or low-skill labor (f = L) and high-skilled labor (f = H), are
combined into a CES aggregate with elasticity of substitution ρ.
As common in the trade literature, we assume iceberg transport costs dnik ≥ 1 from country i to
country n in sector k. The unit cost of supplying variety jk to country n from country i equals:
pnik (jk ) =

These preferences are used in Fieler (2011), with early analyses and applications found in Hanoch (1975) and Chao
and Manne (1982). To the best of our knowledge, there is no common name attached to these preferences, so we will
refer to them as constant relative income elasticity (CRIE) tastes.
13
Note that CRIE preferences (and separable preferences in general) preclude any inferior good: the income elasticity
of demand is always positive for any good. Another notable feature of income elasticities is that they decrease as income
increases (holding prices fixed). This property is actually quite general: average income elasticities decrease with income
for any Walrasian demand.

7

Parameters µikH and µikL capture the high and low-skilled-labor intensity of sector k in country i,
and ρ the elasticity of substitution between types of labor.
There is perfect competition for the supply of each variety jk . Hence, the price of variety jk in
country n in industry k equals:
pnk (jk ) = min{pnik (jk )}
i

We follow Eaton and Kortum (2002) and assume that productivity Zik (jk ) is a random variable
with a Frechet distribution. This setting generates gravity within each sector. Productivity is independently drawn in each country i and industry k, with a cumulative distribution:
h

Fik (z) = exp −(z/zik )−θk

i

where zik is a productivity shifter reflecting average TFP of country i in sector k. As in Eaton and
Kortum (2002), θk is related to the inverse of productivity dispersion across varieties within each
sector.14 As in Costinot, Donaldson and Komunjer (2010), we also allow the shift parameter zik to
vary across exporters and industries, keeping a flexible structure on the supply side and controlling
for any pattern of Ricardian comparative advantage forces at the sector level.
Endowments
Each country i is populated by a number Li of individuals. The total supply of factor f is fixed in
each country and denoted by Vif . Each person is endowed by Vif /Li units of factor Vf i implying no
within-country income inequality.15

2.2

Equilibrium

Equilibrium is defined by the following equations. On the demand side, total expenditures Dnk of
country n in final goods k simply equals population Ln times individual expenditures as shown in (1).
This gives:
Dnk = Ln (λn )−σk α2,k (Pnk )1−σk

(5)

where λn is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the budget constraint:
Ln e n =

demand for final consumption Dnk and intermediate use:

Note that we also assume θk > ξk − 1 for all k to insure a well-defined CES price index for each industry.
We show in Caron et al (2014) that we obtain very similar preference estimates when account for the distribution of
income across quintiles for a subset of countries.

where Ynh refers to total production in sector h.
On the supply side, each industry mimics an Eaton and Kortum (2002) economy. In particular,
given the Frechet distribution, we obtain a gravity equation for each industry. We follow Eaton and
M as import shares
Kortum (2002) notation with the addition of industry subscripts. By denoting πnik

and Xnik as the value of trade from country i to country n, we obtain:

where Sik and Φnk are defined as follows. The “supplier effect”, Sik , is inversely related to the cost

In turn, we define Φnk as the sum of exporter fixed effects deflated by trade costs. Φnk plays the

Finally, two other market clearing conditions are required to determine factor prices and income in
general equilibrium. Income for each factor equals the sum of total production weighted respectively
by factor intensity. With factor supply Vf i and factor price wf i for factor f in country i, market
clearing for factors other than labor implies:

Alternatively, we can generalize this model and assume that the elasticity of substitution for intermediate use differs
from the elasticity of substitution for final use, and depends on the parent industry. This does not affect the elasticity of
the price index w.r.t. Φk . Differences in elasticities of substitution would be captured by the industry fixed effect that
we include in our estimation strategy and would not affect our estimates.

Counterfactual equilibria

Following Dekle et al. (2007) and Caliendo and Parro (2014), the model lends itself naturally to
counterfactual simulations in general equilibrium. By reformulating the above equilibrium conditions
in terms of changes relative to the baseline observed equilibrium, counterfactuals can be obtained
using a set of observed variables and only a few parameters to estimate. We do so with the help of
hat notation, where Zb = Z 0 /Z denotes the relative change for variable Z (Z 0 referring to the value in
the new equilibrium).
We consider two sets of counterfactual simulations. In a first set, we examine the impact of an
increase in productivity zc

. We will simulate both a homogeneous 1% productivity increase

across all countries and sectors and growth in productivity corresponding to recent changes in real
GDP per capita for each country, as well as the impact of factor-specific changes in productivity.
In a second set of counterfactual equilibria, we examine the impact of a uniform 1% decrease in
trade costs dd

across all country pairs as well as the impact of country-by-country decrease

in trade costs.

We solve this system in three iterative steps. In a first step, taking income and factor prices as
given, we use equations (21), (22) and (23) to solve for prices. Then, in a second step, given the
change in prices from step 1, we use equations (16) to (20) to solve for demand, trade and production.
In a third step, we adjust for changes in factor prices and income using (24) to (26). We iterate these
three steps until convergence is achieved.

2.4

Implications for the skill premium

In this section, we illustrate how productivity growth and trade can have an impact on the returns of
some factors production if demand is non-homothetic and there is a systematic relationship between
preference parameters and factor intensities. Such a relationship is supported by the results presented
in Caron et al (2014) which finds, in particular, a positive correlation across sectors between skilledlabor intensity and income elasticity.
2.4.1

Productivity growth and the skill premium

When skill intensity and income elasticity are correlated across industries, productivity (TFP) growth
has a positive effect on the skill premium through the composition of consumption. The intuition is
simple. As productivity increases, people become richer and consume more goods from income-elastic
industries which are, as we show, more intensive in skilled labor.17 This increases the demand for
skilled labor relative to less skilled labor and thus increases the relative wage of skilled workers. On
the contrary, with homothetic preferences, uniform productivity growth across countries is neutral in
terms of skill premium. To develop intuition, we now derive first order approximations of the response
of the skill premium to productivity growth. We show later on how these approximations compare
17

Assuming that the evolution of income is not driven by an accumulation of skills, which can of course mitigate the
increase in the skill premium.

11

with estimates of changes in the skill premium from general equilibrium simulations. The complete
derivation of these approximations can be found in Appendix B.
Autarky without intermediate goods If countries are in autarky and intermediate goods are
ignored, all changes in production can be traced back to changes in domestic consumer demand.
Holding nominal GDP constant (normalization), homogeneous productivity increase zb leads, as a first

obtain that the changes in demand, and therefore production, in country n and sector k are simply

given by the income elasticity ηnk : log D

is the share of sector k in the total skill labor employment in country n (and

shL
nk refers to to the share of unskilled workers in sector k), and ηnk is the income elasticity in sector
k, country n. In this expression, the effect on the skill premium is deflated by an adjusted elasticity
of substitution ρ̃i = ρ − (ρ − 1)

H
k (shik

P

− shL
ik )βikH , which is very close to ρ for most countries (and

always smaller than ρ given the positive correlation between skill intensity and income elasticity).
We can see that this term is positive if income elasticity ηnk is correlated with the demand for high
L
vs. low-skilled labor (the term in shH
nk − shnk ) across sectors. In that case, growth in TFP generates

an increase in the skill premium.
This first-order approximation neglects the feedback effect of the changes in the skill premium on
relative prices across products. When the skill premium increases, the relative price of skill-intensive
goods increases, decreasing the relative demand for these goods and thus the relative demand for
skilled workers. Our general equilibrium simulations indicate that that this feedback effect is small
and can be neglected in a first-order approximation. Note also that this equation provides a good
approximation of the skill premium increase even if labor is not the only factors of production – we
also consider capital, land and other natural resources in our simulations to confirm this. Finally, let
us also point out that this relationship would hold with income elasticities derived from any other
type of preferences as a first-order approximation: the structure imposed on the model only matters
for large changes and for the estimation of income elasticities.
Input-output linkages and trade can also affect the relationship between income elasticity and the
demand for skills, and can be approximated as described just below.
With trade in final and intermediate goods: Under the assumption that the productivity increase

and Blair, 2009; Johnson, 2014). If we denote this matrix by Γ, the coefficients of the matrix (I −Γ)−1 ,
also called Leontief total requirement coefficients, can be then used to link changes in output to changes

we can then express the difference in the

and therefore as a function of income elasticities in downstream sectors, following the same first-order

nk − shnk ) is correlated with the average income elasticity

of all its downstream sectors, in all countries.
2.4.2

Trade cost reductions and the skill premium with non-homothetic preferences

How does a reduction in trade costs affect the skill premium? Standard models of trade such as
Heckscher-Ohlin model have focused on the supply side and ignored any role for the demand side in
explaining the changes in the skill premium. Here we discuss how the structure of preferences may
affect these results relative to a similar structure where we impose homothetic preferences.

13

In a similar fashion as above for the productivity and the skill premium, we can provide a firstorder approximation of the effect of trade cost reductions dˆ on the skill premium (additional details
ˆ 2 . The decomposition isolates
are provided in Appendix) by neglecting second-order terms in (log d)
the direct effect of changes in trade costs and the direct effect of changing consumption patterns from
remaining general equilibrium effects.
Combining equations (25) for factor prices, (20) for production and (19) for bilateral trade, we
obtain:

X
is the share of production in country n that is purchased as inputs by sector h. πnik

M are fitted export and import shares which are constructed based on consumption patterns
and πnik

derived from either homothetic or non-homothetic preferences.
This decomposition, (31) through (34), can be used to illustrate several mechanisms through which
consumption patterns and trade costs affect the demand for skills. The first term captures the direct
incidence of trade costs on production, ignoring changes in consumption patterns and other generalequilibrium effects, while the remaining terms capture indirect effects. The second term captures the
effect of changes in the composition of final demand caused by changes in income and prices. The
third term captures the effect of changes in intermediate demand through input-output linkages. The
fourth term captures changes in factor costs. As we will show, the quantification of all of these terms
depends on preferences being homothetic or non-homothetic.
The first term, which reflects the most direct effect of trade costs on production, depends crucially
on export shares π X across countries and sectors. In particular, it reveals that trade cost reductions
will lead to a larger increase in the skill premium in countries in which the sectors which employ
L
X
the largest shares of skilled workers (high shH
ik − shik ) have the highest export shares (1 − πiik ).

P

M ) is a term capturing import competition, indicating that the skill premium will be
(1 − πnnk

negatively affected by the decrease in trade costs in a country that imports a large share of their
14

consumption of skill-intensive products.
As we will illustrate, fitted export shares depend not only on the supply side (comparative advantage) but also differ largely across specifications on the demand side. With non-homothetic preferences,
poor countries consume relatively less skill-intensive and income-elastic goods than other countries,
and thus have higher export shares for these goods. Conversely, they have relatively lower export
shares in income-inelastic and less skill-intensive goods. A consequence is that a reduction in trade
leads to proportionally larger increases in the production of skill-intensive goods relative to the homothetic case in poor countries. In rich countries, the opposite should hold.
Another direct impact of trade cost reductions on the skill premium can potentially stem from
differences in tradability and trade elasticities across sectors. If skill-intensive sectors have higher
elasticity of trade to trade costs θk or higher export shares, they would expand relatively more with
a reduction in trade costs, and the demand for skills would increase with trade openness. Hence we
will later examine whether trade shares 1 − πiik or θk are correlated with skill intensity and income
elasticities (section 3.4).
The remaining channels in the decomposition relate to different ways in which the model’s endogenous variables react to the reduction in trade costs. The second channel identifies the role of
trade-induced income effects in final demand described in (32), leading to changes in consumption
patterns across industries. As a country and its neighbors open to trade, their income increases, λn
decreases, and consumption shifts towards income-elastic and skill-intensive goods. This mechanism
is the same as was highlighted in the first set of counterfactuals in which we increase productivity.
Obviously, this income effect is not present if we assume homothetic preferences. The term (32) also
captures a price effect, as trade affects the relative price of final goods.
The third term in (33) captures the relationship between the skill premium and changes in the
demand for intermediate goods. Skill-intensive sectors tend to require skill-intensive inputs, so differences in demand patterns caused by non-homothetic preferences can potentially magnify both the
direct effect and the final demand effect through input-output linkages.19
Finally, the fourth “Cost feedback” term (34) reflects changes in the supplier terms Sjk and captures
general-equilibrium feedback on wages and other factor prices. This feedback mitigates the effect of
trade on the skill premium. For instance, a higher skill premium leads to relative higher costs in skillintensive industries, lower exports in these industries, and mitigation of the skill premium increase.

3

Estimation

We now discuss the data and the estimation of the key parameters in the model. The estimation here
closely follows Caron, Fally and Markusen (2014), although with a newer dataset and a number of
additional robustness checks.
19

One should note that we assume Cobb-Douglas production functions, which implies constant input-output requirement coefficients. Additional effects on the skill premium can be obtained by assuming strong complementarity between
manufacturing goods and services, as described in Cravino and Sotelo (2016).

15

3.1

Data

Our empirical analysis is mostly based on the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) version 8 dataset
(Narayanan et al., 2012). This dataset contains consistent and harmonized production, consumption,
endowment, trade data and input-output tables for 57 sectors20 of the economy, 5 production factors,
and 109 countries in 2007. The set of sectors covers both manufacturing and services and the set of
countries covers a wide range of per-capita income levels. Demand systems are estimated over all available countries using final demand values based on the aggregation of private and public expenditures
in each sector.
Factor usage data by sector are directly available in GTAP and cover capital, high-skilled and
low-skilled labor, land and other natural resources. In our counterfactual simulations, we use countryspecific labor shares to characterize our benchmark equilibrium, but our results remain essentially
identical when we use averages of labor shares instead, either across all countries or across relevant
subset of countries. These robustness checks are discussed in Section 4.3.21
Finally, bilateral variables describing physical distance, common language, access to sea, colonial
link and contiguity, required to estimate gravity equations, are obtained from CEPII (www.cepii.fr).22
Dummies for regional trade agreement and common currency are from de Sousa (2012).
Among other model parameters, all but one will be estimated. We do not estimate the elasticity
of substitution between skilled and unskilled labor, ρ, and instead calibrate ρ to 1.4 as estimated by
Katz and Murphy (1994). We examine alternative calibrations in Section 4.3 and show that the effect
of productivity growth and trade costs reductions are approximately proportional to

1
ρ.

Since most

estimates in the literature lie between 1 and 2, our results are robust to alternative calibrations.

3.2

Estimation strategy

The value of final demand in an industry is determined as in Equation (5) or equivalently Equation
(1) for individual expenditures xnk =

Dnk
Ln .

In log, the model provides:

log xnk = −σk . log λn + log α2,k + (1 − σk ). log Pnk

(35)

where α2,k is a preference parameter which varies across industries only. In addition, final demand
should satisfy the budget constraint which determines λn : a higher income per capita is associated
with a smaller Lagrange multiplier λn .
20
Some sectors in GTAP are used primarily as intermediates and correspond to extremely low consumption shares of
final demand. 6 sectors for which less than 10% of output goes to final demand (coal, oil, gas, ferous metals, metals
n.e.c. and minerals n.e.c.) are assumed to be used exclusively as intermediates and are dropped from the final demand
estimations. We also drop “dwellings” from our analysis, as it is associated with no trade and large measurement errors
in consumption and factor intensities.
21
The results are also not sensitive to using either country-specific or average direct requirement coefficients to calibrate
the cost parameters γkhi (equation 9).
22
Distance between two countries is measured as the average distance between the 25 largest cities in each country
weighted by population. Similarly, internal distance within a country is measured as the weighted average of distance
across each combination of city pairs. See Mayer and Zignago (2011).

16

If there were no trade costs, the price index Pnk would be the same across countries and could not
be distinguished from an industry fixed effect. If, in richer countries, consumption were larger in a
particular sector relative to other sectors, the estimated σ̂k would be larger for this sector. Since trade
is not costless, estimated income elasticities would be biased if we did not control for the price index
Pnk (to capture supply-side characteristics). As richer countries have a comparative advantage in skillintensive industries, the price index is relatively lower in these industries. Conversely, poor countries
have a comparative advantage in unskilled-labor-intensive industries and thus have a lower price index
in these industries relative to other industries. When the elasticity of substitution between industries
is larger than one, these differences in price indexes in turn affect the patterns of consumption. If we
were not controlling for Pnk , we would overestimate the income elasticity in skill-intensive sectors.
We thus proceed in two steps. The main goal of the first step is to obtain a proxy for the
price index log Pnk . According to equilibrium condition (11), log Pnk depends linearly on log Φnk
which itself can be identified using gravity equations. Gravity equations by sector are derived from
equation (8). Specifying trade costs log dnik as a linear combination of trade proxies, we obtain our
first-step estimation equation:

b nk equal 0.4 on average. This implies that σk lies around 2 for most sectors.

We describe our procedure in the appendix in more details, along with alternative specifications

approximating the log of the Lagrange multiplier by a linear function of the log of income per capita:
log λn ≈ −ν log en . This approach allows us to identify σd
k ν up to a constant term ν, but one can
see that this constant term drops out of equation (39): the implied income elasticities estimates are
scale invariant. Finally, we have also re-estimated (38) by calibrating θk = 4 across all sectors thereby

Parameter estimates

Gravity

Table 1 presents the results of the gravity equation estimations (Equation 36). The first

column shows the average estimated coefficient across industries while the second column shows the
standard deviation of the coefficient estimate across industries. These standard deviations reflect the
variations of the coefficients across industries but do not reflect measurement errors: all coefficient
estimates are significantly different from zero for most industries. There is significant variation in
the distance and border effect coefficients across industries. As usually found in the gravity equation
literature, the coefficient for distance is on average close to minus one and the border effect coefficients
are large. Coefficients for political variables such as free trade agreements and currency unions are
also significant. These estimates imply an important role for geography in explaining relative prices.
Proximity to countries with a comparative advantage in certain industries leads to significantly lower
b nk terms, which vary greatly
relative prices in these industries. These effects are captured in the Φ
b nk is 1.22, taking the residual
across countries and sectors (the standard deviation of demeaned log Φ
b nk on country and sector fixed effects).

Preferences:

Table 2 describes our income elasticities estimates for the average-income country, as

well as differences in skill intensity across sectors. Estimates range from nearly zero for rice to 1.311
Note that the level of sigmas does not affect the computation of income elasticities, as described in equation (39). Note
that while CRIE preferences imply an explicit link between price and income elasticities, In Section 4.3 we examine the
robustness of our results by using Comin et al. (2015) preferences, which results in an estimated elasticity of substitution
of 0.76 across sectors.

for financial services, with a clear dominance of agricultural sectors at the low end and service sectors
at the high end. Half of the estimates are significantly different than unity at 95 %, with standard
errors between 0.05 and 0.2 for most sectors.24
Comparing our estimation results with the same regression imposing homotheticity (i.e. imposing σk = σ), we confirm the results from Caron, Fally and Markusen (2014): allowing for nonhomotheticity improves the R-squared (non-homotheticity reduces by 25.6% the variance left unexplained with a homothetic preference specification). The contribution of non-homotheticity to the fit of
demand patterns is statistically significant: the F-stats associated with imposing common σk ’s across
industries show that homotheticity is clearly rejected (F-stat equal to 12.15, all P-values < 0.001).25
We also examine several alternative specifications as robustness checks. First, removing the budget
constraint as a constraint in our estimation leads to very similar results, with the new estimates of
Lagrange multipliers correlated at 99% with our baseline estimates. In other words, given the large
variations in per capita income, introducing error terms in the budget constraint constraint does not
affect our results. In all these regressions, Lagrange multipliers and per capita income are highly
correlated, hence once can obtain very similar results by approximating log λn by a linear function of
b nk by an alternative
the log of per capita income. In an alternative specification, we instrument log Φ

measure based only on foreign markets, taking the sum of exporter fixed effects across all other
countries but excluding its own market, but the estimated income elasticity estimates remain very
close, as shown in Figure A.1 in Appendix. Finally, imposing θk = 4 leads to estimates of income
elasticities that are highly correlated with our baseline estimates, as illustrated again in Figure A.1 in
Appendix.
Aside from alternative estimations of preferences featuring Constant Relative Income Elasticities (CRIE), we have also estimated preferences as in Comin, Lashkari and Mestieri (2016). These
preferences impose a common price elasticity σ across sectors while allowing for different income elasticities of demand. Again, this specification leads to very similar results. We also refer to Caron et
al (2014) for a comparison between CRIE, LES (Stone Geary) and AIDS (Deaton and Muellbauer,
1980). While LES yields to much smaller differences in income elasticities across sectors, estimates
based on AIDS are fairly similar to CRIE (the rank correlation is higher than 85% between any two
of these specifications).

Empirical regularities

Correlation between income elasticity and skill intensity

We now investigate the relationship

between income elasticities and factor intensities across sectors, as in Caron, Fally and Markusen
(2014). As we illustrated in the theory section, the correlation between skill intensity and income
elasticity plays a crucial role in determining the impact of productivity growth and trade on the
relative demand for skilled labor. Table 3 reports correlation coefficients between skill intensity and
24

Two sectors have standard deviations between 0.2 and 0.3: gas and wheat.
As in Caron et al (2014), the Akiake (AIC) and Bayesian (BIC) information criterions favor the specification allowing
for non-homotheticity.

income elasticity, or, in columns 2 and 4, the beta coefficients associated with each intensity parameter
in regressions of income elasticity on several factor intensities, as well as robust standard errors.26
Our measures of factor intensity correspond to the ratio of skilled labor, capital or natural resource
(including land) to total labor input. These factor intensities are computed including the factor
usage embedded in the intermediate sectors used in each sector’s production. The correlation is also
illustrated in Figure 1.
We find that skill intensity is positively and significantly correlated with income elasticity. This
correlation is particularly large and higher than 50%, while income elasticity is only weakly correlated
with natural resources intensity and capital intensity once we control for skill intensity. Part of this
large correlation is explained by the composition of consumption into services vs. manufacturing
industries, with services being generally associated with a larger income elasticity. However, the
correlation remains above 50% even after excluding service industries.
As described in appendix, we examine the robustness of our income elasticities estimates using
alternative specifications: imposing θk = 4, instrumenting log Φnk , using a reduced-form approximation, etc. In all these specifications, the correlation between the estimated income elasticity and skill
intensity remains very high, above 50%. Moreover, we find similar correlations if we estimate alternative (non-homothetic) preferences such as AIDS, LES or implicitly additive preferences as in Comin
et al (2016).
Correlation between income elasticity and other factor intensities

It is interesting to note

that capital intensity is positively correlated with income elasticity, as found by Reimer and Hertel
(2010), but this correlation is not as large as for skill intensity (less than 10% in most specifications)
and not robust to controlling for skill intensity as shown in columns (2) and (4) of Table 3. In our
framework, this implies for instance that growth should not greatly affect the returns from capital
relative to wages. Income elasticity also tends to be negatively correlated with intensity in natural
resources, which supports Prebisch-Singer hypothesis and implies that a growth in income per capita
would lower the relative price of natural resources. However the correlation is small and not robust
to controlling for skill intensity (Table 3).
Correlation with trade shares

Another potential determinant of the incidence of trade costs on

the skill premium is the correlation between trade shares and skill intensity across sectors. A decrease
in trade costs leads to a increase in the relative price of traded products, and therefore a change in the
relative employment share of sectors, depending on the elasticity of substitution among sectors. Here
X )
we examine the cross-sectoral correlations between skill intensity and average export shares (1 − πiik

(averaged across countries).
Burstein and Vogel (2016) document that skill intensive sectors tend to be more traded, but
do not consider service sectors. In our data, we find that the correlation depends crucially on the
26

In Caron et al (2014), we find that robust standard errors are very close to bootstrap standard errors constructed by
resampling importers and sectors in all steps of the estimation in order to account for generated variable biases (income
elasticities are estimated rather than observed).

inclusion of service sectors. If service sectors are ignored, the correlation is positive at +30%. Once
we include services, however, the correlation is considerably reduced, weakly negative (-6%) and no
longer significantly different from zero. These patterns are illustrated in Figure 2.
Similar patterns are observed for the correlation between export shares and income elasticities.
Looking across all sectors, income-elastic goods tend to be less traded (-27% correlation). Once we
exclude services, this correlation becomes significantly positive (+38%).

Quantitative implications for the skill premium

4.1

Productivity growth and the skill premium

As argued in Section 2.4, non-homothetic preferences may help explain why the skill premium has
been increasing for a large number of countries (see Goldberg and Pavcnik 2007 for empirical evidence
on the skill premium increase).
When preferences are homothetic, an homogeneous increase in productivity in all countries should
neither affect the patterns of trade nor the relative demand for skilled labor. However, when preferences
are non-homothetic and when the income elasticity of demand is positively correlated with the skill
intensity of production, an increase in productivity makes consumers richer which in turn induces a
relative increase in consumption in skill-intensive industries (high-income elastic industries) and thus
raises the relative demand for skilled labor. This demand-driven explanation contrasts with previous
studies that have focused on the supply side.
In this section, we use our general equilibrium model27 to quantitatively estimate the elasticity
of the skill premium to total factor productivity (TFP). We first simulate a 1% increase in TFP
in all countries and examine how it affects the skill premium in an open economy setting. This
counterfactual pinpoints the role of non-homothetic preferences since the same counterfactual would
keep the skill premium unchanged if preferences were homothetic. We also simulate productivity
increases corresponding to growth rates of per capita income in each country between 1990 and 2014.
Finally, we use the approximations provided in Section 2.4.1 to decompose the role of preferences,
intermediate goods and trade.
Figure 3 displays the elasticity of the skill premium to TFP resulting from an exogenous 1%
TFP increase in all countries28 . Very similar elasticities are obtained by simulating a 10% increase.
Our simulations show that this elasticity is positive for all countries and often large, particularly for
developing countries. For instance, the elasticity of the skill premium to productivity is about 0.07
for China. The predicted elasticity is higher than 0.2 in a number of the least developed countries,
particularly those of South Asia and Africa. The elasticity for South American countries and other
middle income countries is generally in the 0.05 to 0.10 range, while the elasticity for most rich
countries is around or below 0.05.
27

The model is formulated in GAMS and solved by the non-linear PATH solver.
The elasticity is simply the result of dividing the simulated change in the skill premium by the exogenous change in
TFP, 0.01.
28

21

Role of trade and input-output linkages

We now use the approximations derived in the theory

section to identify the relative roles of trade and intermediates in explaining the results above. As
discussed in section 2.4.1, the main argument for the role of non-homothetic preferences does not
involve trade. It also applies to closed economies. To identify the role of trade, we compute closedeconomy approximations of the elasticity of the skill premium to productivity. We use our estimates
L
for income elasticities (ηnk ) as well as labor shares (shH
nk and shnk ) and input-output coefficients, in

the approximation described by equation (30), which accounts for input-output linkages.
These closed-economy elasticity approximations are plotted on Figure 4 against the simulated
open-economy elasticity estimates. As can be seen, there is a very high correlation between the approximated skill-premium elasticity in closed economy and the simulated elasticities in open economy.
The coefficient of the fitted line yields a coefficient equal to 1.03 (s.e. 0.03) with an R-squared of 99%.
Besides production being mostly destined to local consumption, the difference between the closedeconomy and open-economy counterfactuals is small because countries tend to trade with countries
of similar per capita income, so that the change in the composition of consumption of their trading
partners is fairly similar to their own. We conclude that ignoring trade linkages when investigating
the role of income-driven shifts in consumption would not lead to substantial biases.
We next investigate the importance of input-output linkages in determining the skill premium
estimates. Figure 4 shows that the skill premium elasticity approximations implied by the formula
in equation (27), which only takes the final demand for goods into account, also provides a good
approximation of the open-economy simulated elasticity. In this case, though, approximated elasticities
are consistently above the simulated elasticities, suggesting that ignoring input-output linkages would
lead to over-estimating the increase in skill premium somewhat.
Decomposition

Why is this effect on the skill premium larger for poor countries? As we have

shown in section 4, it depends on the income elasticity of demand and employment shares across
skills and sectors. CRIE preferences generate income elasticities of consumption which decrease with
income, which could explain why the effect on the skill premium may be smaller for richer countries:
income growth leads to less re-allocation of consumption across sectors.
A simple decomposition shows that while this mechanism is at play, differences in employment
shares across skills and countries play a more important role. In developing countries, a larger share
of the low-skilled labor force produces income-inelastic goods while skilled workers produce incomeelastic goods. In rich countries, there are smaller differences in income elasticity between the goods
that skilled and less-skilled workers produce. This is illustrated in Figure 5: the predicted elasticity
of the skill premium to productivity also decreases with income if we replace employment shares by
their average across countries within each sector, but the difference across countries is slightly more
pronounced if instead we replace income elasticity by its average across countries within each sector
(i.e. such that all the variations across countries comes from differences in employment shares).

22

With actual growth in per capita GDP Finally, we examine the change in the skill premium
predicted by our mechanism if each country grew at historical rates. Figure 6 shows our estimates of
the change in the skill premium resulting from the simulation of growth rates from the Penn World
Table (version 9 “cgdpe”) between 1990 and 2014. Per capita GDP and simulated skill premium
increases are also reported in Table 4) in Appendix. The objective of the exercise is not to provide
predictions of future changes in the skill premium, nor quantify the share of observed changes which
the mechanism might have explained. Observed estimates of skill premium are likely caused by a
number of confounding and possibly interacting mechanisms. Rather, it aims to provide an estimate
of the potential magnitude of the effect which can simply be contrasted with observed values.
Results vary considerably between countries. The predicted increase can be very large (above
10% for 18 countries) or negative (for only 3 countries). For China, our simulation leads to a 10.1%
increase in the skill premium. To contrast, Ge and Yang (2009) find that the skill premium increase
was 40% in China between 1992 and 2006.

29

Our simulation yield a 15.6% increase for India, to

be contrasted to an observed 11.9% increase over the 1987-2004 period (Azam, 2009). For Thailand,
our simulations lead to a 5% increase, to be contrasted to the 17.2% observed skill premium increase
from 1990 to 2004 (DiGropello and Sakellariou, 2010). Overall, the effect is largest in fast-growing
developing economies.
In Latin America, the mechanism explains smaller but still significant shares of observed increases:
our simulations lead to a 6.2 % increase in Peru, contrasted to an observed increase of 23.9% from 1994
to 2000 (Mazumdar and Quispe-Agnoli, 2004); a 1.8% increase in Mexico, contrasted to an observed
12.5% increase (Verhoogen, 2008) from 1990 to 2001; and a 3.5% increase in Columbia to be contrasted
to an observed 26.4% skill premium increase between 1990 and 2000 (Gutierrez, 2009).
Among developed countries, the predicted increase in skill premium driven by demand-side reallocation is rather small but non-negligible: slightly less than 1% for instance for the US, contrasted to
an observed 3.1% skill premium increase (Parro, 2013); 1% in Great Britain, contrasted to an observed
2% increase for 1990-2005 (Parro, 2013). The low estimates resulting from the simulations generally
match the lower observed increases in the skill premium for the richest countries.
Another observation which we can make is that despite large differences in skill premium estimates,
we find that the implied elasticities of the skill premium to productivity using actual income growth
are similar to what we obtain in the neutral productivity growth simulations. Indeed, most of the
variation in estimates stems from the high variation in the growth rates which countries experienced
during this time period, especially among developing countries. This suggests again that trade linkages
between countries are not major drivers of this demand-driven mechanism.

4.2

Trade liberalization and the skill premium

Our next set of counterfactual simulations examines the effect of a 1% reduction in trade costs, first
across all country pairs, then, in Section 4.3, country-by-country (to and from each country in turn).
29
The Gini coefficient in China has also sharply increased from less than 30 in the early 1990s to 42 in 2005 (World
Bank data).

23

In each case, we compare two specifications, one imposing homothetic preferences and one allowing
for non-homotheticity, using our baseline estimates.
Figure 7 displays the percentage change in the skill premium caused by the 1% reduction in trade
costs. With homothetic preferences, the effect of trade on the skill premium tends to be negative for
developing countries and positive among the richest countries. This is in line with standard StolperSamuelson predictions: trade leads to a decrease in the relative demand for skilled labor in countries
that are abundant in unskilled labor, and an increase in the skill premium in more skilled-labor
abundant countries.
This effect is mitigated, and sometimes reversed, when we allow for non-homothetic preferences. As
can be seen in Figure 7, the significant correlation between the effect of trade on the skill premium and
a country’s per capita GDP largely disappears. To make things clearer, Figure 8 plots the difference in
the effect of trade on the skill premium between non-homothetic and homothetic preferences. While
the difference is largest for countries with low per capita income, it is positive for almost all countries:
trade cost reductions lead to a larger increase in the skill premium with non-homothetic preferences.
Decomposition:

We use equations (31) through (34) to examine the channels that explain these

systematic differences between homothetic and non-homothetic preferences.
Figure 9(a) plots the “direct trade patterns effects” term of the decomposition, (31). This term
approximates the direct effect of a trade cost reduction on the skill premium, holding trade and
demand patterns constant (for each specification of preferences) and neglecting general-equilibrium
feedback effects caused by changes in factor costs. Figure 11(a) plots the difference between nonhomothetic and homothetic preferences. These differences are driven only by variations in trade shares
caused differences in demand patterns, as the supply-side parameters are held constant across both
preference specifications. With non-homothetic preferences, low income countries have a relatively
smaller demand for skill-intensive goods, and thus tend to export a larger share of these goods relative
to the homothetic preferences benchmark. As a result, a decrease in trade costs leads to a larger
expansion of skill-intensive sectors and therefore a larger increase in the relative demand for skilled
labor and the skill premium. The converse holds for rich countries, who end up facing a relatively
smaller demand for skill-intensive goods when they open up to trade. The difference between nonhomothetic and homothetic preferences is quite large and explains (on average) about half of the
overall simultated difference in skill premium changes for the poorest countries. While the effect on
high-income countries is much weaker, it does reveal that a homothetic model would slightly overestimate the impact of the skill premium on very open rich countries. We conclude that models
imposing homothetic preferences when describing trade shares would substantially over-estimate the
net factor content of trade, and therefore the effect of trade on the skill premium.
As equation (31) suggests, the direct effect of trade costs may also be affected by a systematic
correlation between income elasticity, skill intensity and average tradability across sectors. In Section
3.4, however, we find that such a correlation is slightly negative but very weak once services are

24

included.30 In order to further test for the potential relevance of this correlation, we have re-evaluated
the direct effect using average export shares at the sector level. The difference between non-homothetic
and homothetic preferences in this case is very small. Most of the direct effect, thus, relies on variations
in country-specific export shares driven by differences in comparative advantage.
Figure 9(b) plots the second “income effects in final demand” term of the decomposition and Figure
11(b) plots the difference between the two preference specifications. This term captures changes in
consumption patterns driven by changes in prices and income. With homothetic preferences, trade
only generates small changes in consumption patterns.31 However with non-homothetic preferences,
trade liberalization generates an increase in real income which, similar to productivity growth, leads
to a reallocation of consumption towards income-elastic goods which are also more skill intensive,
and leads to an increase in the skill premium. Contrasted to the direct impact of trade on the skill
premium, this channel is quantitatively strong. The effect of trade on income changes consumption
patterns in a way that explains a large part of the differences in the effect of trade across preference
specifications. As in the first set of counterfactual simulations, it is strongest for developing countries.
Note that this term only reflects the direct impact of changes in final demand, the effect of intermediate
demand being captured in the following term.
Figure 10(a) illustrates the role of input-output linkages for each specification, while Figure 11(c)
plots the difference between the two specifications. Since trade-driven income growth leads to a larger
expansion in skill-intensive sectors with non-homothetic preferences, it also leads to a relatively larger
demand for skill-intensive intermediate goods. One can see in Figure 11(c) that the difference in the
specifications is not as large as what is explained by the first two decomposition terms (and about
half of the differential effect on final demand).
Finally, as illustrated in the fourth term of our decomposition, general equilibrium effects captured
by the differences in Sik mitigate the direct effect of trade costs. As shown in Figure 10(b) this feedback
effect can be large for some countries, especially those for which the direct effect was large. However,
the difference between homothetic and non-homothetic preferences is small (as also illustrated in
Figure 11(d) – notice the scale on the Y axis): while general equilibrium feedbacks mitigate the
differences described with the previous decomposition terms, they are far from offsetting them.
To summarize, a combination of the income-driven consumption composition effect (which drives
the second and third terms) and the substantially reduced Stolper-Samuelson effect (identified through
the first term) explains why, in our general equilibrium simulations, non-homothetic preferences imply
only a small depressing effect of trade on the skill premium in poor countries. For rich countries,
non-homothetic preferences play a smaller role, in part because the two effects coming from nonhomotheticities (direct and income effects) go in opposite directions. In their case, though, the income
effect generally dominates and the skill premium is slightly higher than with homothetic preferences.
30
Note that to be able to simulate general equilibrium effects on the skill premium, we must include all sectors in the
economy.
31
With lower price elasticities, as in Cravino and Sotelo (2016), we find higher effects on the skill premium, but the
effects remain larger with non-homothetic preferences, as documented in our robustness checks in Section 4.3.

25

4.3

Robustness

Elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled workers

As made evident in the

analytical approximations provided in Section 2.4, the effects of productivity and trade are sensitive
to the elasticity of substitution ρ between skilled and unskilled labor. A higher ρ leads to smaller
effects. While this elasticity is difficult to estimate in practice, most estimates lie between 1.4 and 1.7
(Acemoglu 2007).
Using our analytical approximations, it is fairly straightforward to predict the role of alternative
elasticities on the effect of productivity and trade. Relative to the Cobb-Douglas specification (ρ = 1),
the change in the skill premium is scaled by a ratio of 1 over ρ̃i = ρ − (ρ − 1)

H
k (shik

P

− shL
ik )βikH .

We find that this adjustment provides a very good approximation of actual simulations results with
higher elasticities as long as the changes are not too large. It can therefore be used to quickly identify
the sensitivity of results to ρ.
For instance, for the trade counterfactual (reducing trade costs by 1%), we compare results with
ρ = 1.4 (as in our benchmark calibration) and ρ = 1.7, after multiplying the skill premium increase
by ρ̃i = ρ − (ρ − 1)

H
k (shik

P

− shL
ik )βikH . Elasticities of substitutions between 1.4 and 1.7 imply values

of ρ̃i between 1.3 and 1.6. As shown in Figure 12, there is virtually no difference between simulations
once we account for the ρ̃i adjustment. Also, the effect of growth and trade remains sizeable across
this range of elasticities.
Homogeneous trade elasticity θk = 4

Another parameter which may potentially affect our sim-

ulation results is θk . This parameter drives the response of trade flows to changes in trade costs. It
affects our price index estimates and thus the estimation of income elasticities, and may also affect
the results of the trade cost counterfactual. Our baseline simulations rely on sector-specific estimates
of θk which we recover from the estimation of preferences of equation (38). As documented in Caron
et al 2014, the income elasticity estimates are sensitive to this choice. Moreover, our estimated θk
are slightly correlated with income elasticity (11% correlation) but this correlation is not crucial for
our results. To check the robustness of results, a simple alternative is to assume that θk = 4 in all
sectors as in Simonovska and Waugh (2011), a calibrated value often borrowed by the international
trade literature, also in line with estimates by Costinot et al (2012), Donaldson (2012) among others.
In appendix, we show that this assumption leads to alternative estimates of income elasticities that
are highly correlated (at 86%) with our baseline estimates. As these are also highly correlated with
skill intensity, using these estimates in our simulations leads to similar results for the skill premium.
Figure A.3 in appendix replicates the productivity counterfactual and Figure A.4 replicates the trade
cost counterfactual with these alternative preference estimates.
Price elasticity and Comin et al (2016) implicitly-additive preferences The preferences assumed in our benchmark specification are separable. Separability is a natural and common assumption
but an important disadvantage is that it imposes a strong link between price elasticities and income
elasticities in consumption. Comin et al (2016) and Matsuyama (2017) explore “implicitly-additive”
26

preferences that have the advantage of breaking the link between price and income elasticities. As a
robustness check, we estimate Comin et al (2016) preferences using our data and similar tools.
This specification is described in equation (A.11) in Appendix. We impose a value θk = 4 for
this specification, and estimate the elasticity of substitution between sectors. Our estimated elasticity
of substitution is equal to 0.76, which is within the range of Comin et al (2016)’s own estimates
(0.8 and 0.6 with cross-section and panel data respectively). Using mean expenditure shares, implied
income elasticities are highly correlated with our benchmark income elasticities (CRIE) as described
in Figure A.5 (89.9% correlation) and are again highly correlated with skill intensity in production
(71.2% correlation).
As argued by Cravino and Sotelo (2016), lower elasticity of substitution between sectors leads
to larger skill premium increases with both types of preferences, yet the difference between nonhomothetic and homothetic preferences remains large, if not larger with Comin et al (2016) implicitlyadditive specification. The results of our two main counterfactuals (1% productivity increase and 1%
trade costs decrease) are plotted in Figure A.6(a) and (b) and are qualitatively and quantitatively
similar to our benchmark specification.
Alternative measures of skill and unskilled labor intensity

While the GTAP dataset provides

skilled and unskilled labor usage for all countries, part of this information is extrapolated from a subset
of European countries and 6 non-European countries (US, Canada, Australia, Japan, Taiwan and
South Korea).32 Also, skilled labor is defined on an occupational basis for a few of these countries (e.g.
the US). In our baseline analysis, we use country-specific shares of skilled labor (provided by GTAP)
βikL and βikH in equation 23 in order to solve for the counterfactual change in wages. Our results
are however not very sensitive to this choice. An alternative would be to use a cross-country average
of skilled labor and unskilled labor intensity (β̄kL and β̄kH ) in equation 23. As shown in Figure A.3
for the productivity counterfactual and Figure A.4 for the trade cost counterfactual, this specification
leads to similar results. The robustness of results is due to income elasticities being strongly correlated
with the country-specific measures of skill intensity of most countries, as documented in Caron et al
(2014).
Reducing trade costs one country at a time An alternative set of counterfactual simulations
is to reduce trade costs for each country, one at a time (to and from a given country). The effect
of trade costs reductions on the skill premium slightly differs from the main counterfactuals, but the
main point remains: non-homothetic and homothetic preferences yield very different changes in the
skill premium for the country for which we consider a trade cost reduction. With this set of counterfactuals, we can derive a similar decomposition as in Equation (31-34), highlighting a direct effect of
trade costs on production patterns (taking demand and factor prices as given) as well as an income
effect and general-equilibrium feedback effects. We provide the details in Appendix and results are
provided in Figure A.7. In this graph, each point is a different counterfactual (one counterfactual
32

See: https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/download/4183.pdf

27

separately for each country liberalizing trade) and we plot the effect on the skill premium for the corresponding country. Simulated changes in the skill premium are similar to the baseline counterfactual
for the country from and to which trade costs are reduced. Importantly, the results strongly differ
between homothetic and non-homothetic specifications, especially for developing countries where the
skill premium does not decrease as much as in the homothetic case.

Summary and conclusions

Growing income inequality is a defining feature of our time, and many reasons for the increasing
premium awarded to skilled workers have been identified and studied by the literature. We provide a
quantitative assessment of a simple yet overlooked mechanism: growth in income increasingly shifts
consumption patterns towards goods and services that require relatively more skilled labor in their
production. We assess the potential scope for this mechanism through a general-equilibrium framework
which relates consumption choices to the demand for skills. Our approach relies on cross-country
variations in income and consumption to identify the income elasticity of demand.
Simulations suggest that factor-neutral productivity growth can indeed lead to substantial increases in the skill premium, especially for developing countries which are rapidly transitioning out of
unskilled-labor intensive sectors such as agriculture and basic manufacturing. The predicted changes
in the skill premium caused by the changing composition of consumption represents a sizable share
of observed increases in many countries and is comparable in magnitude to other well-studied mechanisms such as skill-biased technological change in explaining why, despite accumulation of skills,
inequality has been increasing.
We then show that income-driven changes in the composition of consumption can also be quantitatively important during an episode of trade liberalization – another commonly studied cause of
changes in the skill premium. Like productivity, trade raises incomes and increases the return to skill
labor, with, once again, a strong effect in the developing world. The relationship between income
and consumption patterns has further implications: relative to a homothetic preference benchmark in
which consumption shares across sectors are independent of income, accounting for non-homothetic
preferences reduce trade’s impact on the skill premium. The sector-level correlation between income
elasticity and skill intensity implies a country-level correlation between relative specialization in consumption and relative specialization in production. This leads to a lower predicted net factor content
of trade and therefore a weaker link between trade and relative wages. In many developing countries,
this weakening of Stolper-Samuelson forces, combined with the effect of shifting consumption patterns,
completely cancel the decrease on the skill premium predicted by a standard homothetic-preference
model. In rich countries, both of these effects are weaker. Overall, our simulations suggest much
smaller differences in the impact of trade liberalization on the skill premium between rich and poor
countries.
We do not claim this to be the main mechanism behind increasing wage disparities. It is likely
working alongside other forces, such as skill-biased technical change (Burstein and Vogel 2015) and

28

structural transformation (Cravino and Sotelo 2016), with which it is not incompatible. Future research may want to integrate and contrast alternative mechanisms in a unified framework.
Our results are contingent on the cross-country approach which we have taken. While the broad
cross-section of countries allows us to predict the range of per capita incomes in which the effect is
likely to be strong, we cannot directly test whether preferences are indeed identical across countries nor
constant in time. Our approach also does not allow us to make out-of-sample predictions regarding
the continuing evolution of income-driven consumption shifts in the richest countries. Instead, we
rely on a robust empirical fact (the correlation between income elasticity and skill intensity) and a
structural approach to illustrate the impact of trade and growth on the skill premium.

A) Baseline and counterfactual equilibria
From the demand equation (5):
Dnk = Ln (λn )−σk α2,k (Pnk )1−σk
It is easy to obtain the counterfactual change in demand as a function of the change in prices and
Lagrange multiplier, which yields equation (16) in the main text:
c
d
D
nk = λn

−σk

d
P
nk

1−σk

The change in the Lagrange multiplier is such that total expenditures equal income (equation 6). This
yields equation (26); the change in total expenditures also equals the change in income:
ecn =

P d
k Dnk Dnk
P

Dnk

Total demand Xnk for goods k in country n is the sum of the demand for final consumption Dnk and
intermediate use (equation 7). This also holds in the counterfactual equilibrium, which yields:

nk = Dnk Dnk +

In this equation, importer fixed effects correspond to log X
Φnk and exporter fixed effects correspond to

log Sik . These terms are identified up to an industry constant (e.g. αk in preferences). We normalize
the exporter fixed effect SU S,k to unity in each sector k.
T Cvar,ni refers to the variables (indexed by var) included in the gravity equation to capture trade
costs between n and i. Following the literature on gravity, we include the log of physical distance
(including internal distance when i = n), a common language dummy, a colonial link dummy, a border
effect dummy (equal to one if i 6= n), a contiguity dummy (equal to one if countries i and n share
a common border), a free-trade-agreement dummy (equal to one if there is an agreement between
countries i and n), a common currency dummy and a common-legal-origin dummy (equal to one if i
and n have the same legal origin: British, French, German, Scandinavian or socialist). Parameters
δvar,k capture the elasticity of trade costs to each trade cost variable var, which may differ across
industries. Since all coefficients to be estimated are sector specific, we estimate this gravity equation
separately for each sector. Following Silva and Tenreyro (2006) and Fally (2015), we estimate gravity
using the Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood estimator (Poisson PML).

Step 2: Demand system estimation and identification of σk
The first step estimation gives us an estimate of Φnk . From Equation (11), we know that the price
index Pnk is a log-linear function of Φnk which we can use as a proxy for Pnk on the right-hand side
of Equation (35) describing final demand.33
As described in the text, we estimate equation (38) for final demand:
log xnk = −σk . log λn + log α3,k +

(σk − 1)

log Φ

(A.7)

where εD
nk denotes the error term. In each country n, we further impose the sum of fitted expenditures across sectors to equal observed total per capita expenditures en , which leads to the following
constraint:

exp −σk . log λn + log α3,k +

We jointly estimate these equations using constrained non-linear least squares (we minimize the sum

of squared errors (εD
nk ) while imposing both Equations 38 and A.8 to hold). Observed variables

b nk , individual expenditures xnk per industry (net of intermediate goods) and
are: the price proxies Φ

total expenditures en .Free parameters to be estimated are the σk , θk , λn and α3,k . This estimation
procedure can be seen as a non-linear least squares estimation of equation (38) in which λn is the
implicit solution of the budget constraint, equation (A.8), and thus a function of fitted coefficients
and observed per capita expenditures en .
At least one normalization is required. Given the inclusion of industry fixed effects, λn can be
identified only up to a constant.34 We normalize λU SA = 1 for the US.
Alternative specifications
We explore several alternative specifications to illustrate the robustness of our income elasticity estimates:
• Specification without budget constraint
33

In Caron et al (2014), we show that this approach yields better and more conservative outcomes than using actual
prices from the International Comparison Program. Using actual prices leads to a lower R-squared and a stronger
correlation between income elasticity and skill intensity across sectors.
34
To see this, we can multiply λn by a common multiplier λ0 and multiply the industry fixed effect αk by (λ0 )σk . Using
0
λn λ instead of λn and αk (λ0 )σk instead of αk in the demand system generates the same expenditures by industry.

8

In our baseline estimation, we constraint our fitted per capita expenditures to sum up to observed
per capita total expenditures en for each country. In other words, we assume that en is observed
without measurement errors. However, we obtain similar estimates without this constraint, as
illustrated in Figure A.1.
Given our good fit for final demand at the country-by-sector level, the fit of total expenditures
for each country is then also very good. The difference is negligible if we compare it to the very
large variations in per capita income across countries. Hence, imposing a perfect fit for en does
not generate substantial differences in our estimates.
• Reduced-form estimation
While our estimation procedure is consistent with general equilibrium conditions and our specification of preferences, we show that similar estimates are found when estimating Equation (38)
with a reduced-form approximation in which log λn is replaced by a linear function of log en .
Assuming that log λn ≈ ν log en , we obtain:
1 − σk
. log Φnk + nk
θk

log xnk = −σk ν log en + log α4,k +

(A.9)

where log α4,k and ν are constant terms. Even if ν is not separately identified from σk , we can
obtain an estimate of income elasticities in each sector:

We report our estimates in Figure A.1.
• Specification with θk = 4
The benchmark specification described above identifies σk and income elasticities solely based
on the coefficient associated with the Lagrange multiplier λn . The σk parameter also appears
in the coefficient for Φnk in Equation (38) but the benchmark specification does not impose any
constraint on the coefficient for Φnk since θk is a free parameter. In an alternative estimation,
we jointly identify σk from the coefficients on λn and Φnk by constraining θk to equal 4 in all
sectors. This choice of θ is close to the Simonovska and Waugh (2014) estimates of 4.12 and
4.03. Donaldson (2012), Eaton et al. (2011), Costinot et al. (2012) provide alternative estimates
that range between 3.6 and 5.2. Alternative values for θ (e.g. θk = 8) yield very similar results
for income elasticities.

Figure A.2 indicates that the two approaches yield very similar estimates with the exception of
a few small sectors (“wtr”: water, “c b” cane and beet sugar, “ros”: recreational services).
To illustrate how controlling for trade costs matters, we also estimate final demand by dropping
b nk = 0 in the regression. This is equivalent to assuming that there is no trade costs and
log Φ

that all countries face the same prices. In this specification, we find even larger differences in
estimated income elasticity, as illustrated in Figure A.1. These estimates are correlated at 93%
with our baseline estimates.
• Comin, Lashkari and Mestieri (2016)
Following Comin, Lashkari and Mestieri (2016), we examine a specification where utility Un for
consumers in country n is implicitly defined by:

αkσ Un

σ−1

Qnkσ = 1

k

This leads to final demand:35
1−σ
xnk = αk eσn Unk −σ Pnk

(A.11)

This implicit utility function does not impose any link between income elasticities (parameterized
by k ) and price elasticities (σ), unlike separable utility functions where income elasticities are
proportional to price elasticities across sectors for any country.
We estimate equation (A.11) by letting Un be a free parameter. An alternative (as in Comin
et al 2016) would be to construct a proxy for Un , which would be roughly equivalent to the
reduced-form approach discussed above (estimation equation A.9).36
Using these estimates, the income elasticity can be retrieved as:
ηnk = 1 + (1 − σ)

k − ¯n
¯n − σ

where ¯n is an average of k weighted by consumption shares to ensure that the weighted average
of income elasticities equals one for each country n (Engel aggregation).
Figure A.5 compares these estimates to our baseline specification, using average expenditures
to compute ¯n . The two sets of estimates are very close and correlated at 89.9%. Moreover, the

k −σ

σ−1

In this sum, each term is equal to the share of good k in expenditures: xenk
= αkσ Un σ Qi σ .
n
36
One can see from the definition of U above that we can rescale with any exponent U 0 = U a , hence (i − σ) is defined
only up to a constant term. However, the income elasticity in CLM can still be identified as it is invariant to re-scaling
utility by an exponent a.

income elasticities estimated with Comin et al (2016) preferences remain highly correlated with
skill intensity in production (71.2% correlation).

D) Robustness of counterfactual simulation results
D1) Using Comin Lashkari Mestieri preferences
Here we describe the counterfactual equilibrium conditions for final demand when we use the preferences as in Comin et al (2016). Taking change ratios of final demand (equation A.11), we obtain:

D2) Reducing trade costs, one country at a time
We now examine the effect of a trade cost reduction log dd
nik for all countries pairs that include a given
country i.
The decomposition is the same as before up to equation A.4. The only term that differs from the
previous decomposition is the first “direct effect” term:
