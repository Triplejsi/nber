Kinship, Cooperation, and the Evolution of Moral Systems
Benjamin Enke
NBER Working Paper No. 23499
June 2017, Revised October 2018
JEL No. D0,O0
ABSTRACT
Across the social sciences, a key question is how societies manage to enforce cooperative
behavior in social dilemmas such as public goods provision or bilateral trade. According to an
influential body of theories in psychology, anthropology, and evolutionary biology, the answer is
that humans have evolved moral systems: packages of functional psychological and biological
mechanisms that regulate economic behavior, including a belief in moralizing gods; moral values;
negative reciprocity; and emotions of shame, guilt, and disgust. Based on a stylized model, this
paper empirically studies the structure and evolution of these moral traits as a function of
historical heterogeneity in extended kinship relationships. The evidence shows that societies with
a historically tightly-knit kinship structure regulate behavior through communal moral values;
revenge taking; emotions of external shame; and notions of purity and disgust. In loose kinship
societies, on the other hand, cooperation appears to be enforced through universal moral values;
internalized guilt; altruistic punishment; and an apparent rise and fall of moralizing religions.
These patterns point to the presence of internally consistent, but culturally variable, functional
moral systems. Consistent with the model, the relationship between kinship ties, economic
development, and the structure of the mediating moral systems amplified over time.

Introduction

Social and economic life are pervaded by social dilemmas – situations that are characterized by a conflict between collective and individual interests. Be it in the contexts of
the tragedy of the commons, bilateral trade, stealing, team production, or mutual aggression, people could in principle effectively cooperate with each other, yet basic game
theory tells us that defecting on others is often a rational strategy for self-interested individuals. Given the ubiquitous presence of social dilemmas, psychologists and anthropologists argue that this “fundamental problem of human existence” (Greene, 2014) is
of such importance that it has induced societies to build its entire social organization
around solving this problem (Henrich, n.d.).
In these theories, researchers point to the existence of variation in societal structures, as they are induced by differences in kinship systems. Some societies are said to
consist of multiple, disjoint, tightly knit and cohesive in-groups that form dense social
networks of kith and kin. Here, these social groups form the basic unit of society. People are believed to effectively cooperate with in-group members, yet everybody outside
the in-group is considered an enemy, which effectively partitions society into “us” and
“them”. In other societies, in contrast, the individual is the basic unit of society. Here,
people are said to have weaker personal relationships, but presumably also engage in
mutually beneficial interactions with members of society at large because they have less
pronounced in-group vs. out-group notions (see, e.g., Hofstede, 1984; Shweder, 1991;
Markus and Kitayama, 1991; Triandis, 1995; Nisbett, 2003). Loosely in line with these
accounts, experimental games have revealed that cooperation behavior indeed varies
widely across societies (Henrich et al., 2001, 2010; Herrmann et al., 2008).
Economists, psychologists, and anthropologists alike have long worked towards an
understanding of which mechanisms sustain and enforce cooperative behavior. However, if societies exhibit different scopes of cooperation, then they should also employ
different tools to incentivize people to behave cooperatively. While economists typically emphasize institutions and social norms, psychologists, anthropologists and evolutionary human biologists have recently started to argue that certain psychological
and biological facets have specifically evolved to support effective cooperation, so that
cross-cultural variation can be rationalized as reflecting differential needs for “internal
police officers”, i.e., psychological punishment devices (e.g., Haidt, 2012; Greene, 2014;
Norenzayan et al., 2016; Henrich, 2015, n.d.). The key argument is that maintaining
cooperation within in-groups that typically depend on repeated interaction requires a
different set of psychological or biological adaptations as well as formal or informal institutions than regulating behavior in societies that largely rely on impersonal exchange.
According to this literature, key mechanisms for sustaining cooperation in the latter
1

type of society are hypothesized to be (i) “moralizing” gods that are actively concerned
with and supportive of human morality (Norenzayan and Shariff, 2008; Norenzayan,
2013; Botero et al., 2014), (ii) an emphasis on universal moral values versus “tribalistic” values such as in-group loyalty (Fei et al., 1992; Shweder et al., 1997; Haidt,
2012; Greene, 2014), (iii) a prevalence of emotions of internal guilt relative to external shame (Dodds, 1957; Benedict, 1967; Bowles and Gintis, 2003; Henrich, n.d.), and
(iv) widespread altruistic punishment (Fehr and Gächter, 2002; Boyd et al., 2003). On
the other hand, enforcing behavior in a kith-and-kin based society is hypothesized to
rely on “tribalistic” moral values, an emphasis on second-party punishment (revengetaking), external shaming of wrongdoings, strong local institutions, and conformity to
social norms, including values related to norm adherence.
This paper presents a unified empirical analysis of this large body of psychological and anthropological theories. The contribution is twofold. First, the paper develops a novel measure of the tightness of historical kinship systems as proxy for social
organization, which builds directly on observable societal characteristics and can be
used to study variation across a large number of historical and contemporary societies.
Second, by linking kinship tightness to various cross-cultural datasets from economics,
psychology, and anthropology, the empirical analysis documents the presence of a continuum of social cooperation systems that are associated with fundamentally different
enforcement devices, including aspects of human psychology and biology. At one end
of the spectrum, societies with weak kinship ties cooperate and trust broadly, but do
not place special emphasis on helping in-group members in need. Such cooperation
patterns appear to be enforced through a belief in moralizing gods, universal moral values, internalized guilt, altruistic punishment, and large-scale institutions. At the other
extreme, societies with tight kinship structures are readily willing to support in-group
members, but cheat on and deeply distrust the out-group. This cooperation system of
in-group favoritism tends to be regulated within the group through strong local institutions, conformity to social norms, relationship-specific “tribalistic” moral values such
as in-group loyalty, revenge-taking, and emotions of shame.
According to cultural anthropologists, the structure of kinship systems is the most
important determinant of social organization. Kinship describes the system of procreative relationships in society, i.e., patterns of relatedness as they arise through mating
and birth. This concept is much broader than Western notions of the nuclear family.
Kinship is relevant in the present context because cohesive and tight kinship systems
are believed to give rise to “clannish” social structures (Henrich, n.d.), and are hence
directly related to the scope of people’s cooperation patterns. This paper develops a
measure of the historical tightness of kinship systems that is based on information in

2

the Ethnographic Atlas, an ethnographic dataset on the historical structure of 1,311
pre-industrial ethnicities around the globe (Murdock, 1967; Giuliano and Nunn, 2017).
Anthropological textbook knowledge prescribes that kinship systems can be classified
along three dimensions, i.e., family structure, marriage patterns, and descent systems
(Parkin, 1997; Haviland, 2002; Schultz and Lavenda, 2005; Henrich, n.d.). Closely following prior anthropological work, for each of these dimensions, I identify two variables
in the Ethnographic Atlas that measure the respective dimensions of kinship, and aggregate them through a factor analysis. The resulting score of kinship tightness loads
positively on the presence of extended versus nuclear family systems, negatively on
neolocal post-marital residence (family structure), positively on the presence of both
cousin marriage and polygamy (marriage patterns), and positively on the presence of
lineages and localized clans (descent systems). Thus, the score intuitively corresponds
to what anthropologists consider tight kinship systems. This composite index can be
used to study variation (i) within the Ethnographic Atlas, i.e., across historical ethnicities, (ii) across contemporary countries by matching historical ethnicities to contemporary populations (Giuliano and Nunn, 2017), (iii) across contemporary ethnicities
within countries in the World Values Survey by linking historical ethnicities to contemporary ethnicities, (iv) across contemporary second-generation migrants in the European Social Survey by linking migrants to the characteristics of their ancestors from
their country of origin, and (v) across contemporary first-generation migrants in the
Global Preference Survey (Falk et al., 2016) and the Moral Foundations Questionnaire
(Haidt and Joseph, 2004; Graham et al., 2012).
The empirical analysis begins at the country level, by investigating the relationship
between kinship tightness and the radius of trust. The analysis documents that kinship
tightness is positively correlated with trust in in-group members (e.g., neighbors), but
negatively associated with both generalized trust and trust in specific categories of outgroup members such as strangers or foreigners. In addition, by exploiting variation in
kinship tightness and trust across contemporary ethnicities in the World Values Survey and across second-generation migrants in the European Social Survey, the analysis
documents that the relationship between ancestral kinship tightness and people’s trust
extends to individual-level within-country analyses. Here, again, people from tight kinship societies exhibit higher in-group trust, but lower trust in people in general. In a final
step of the analysis of trust patterns, I exploit ethnographic records that code the extent
to which historical ethnicities in the Ethnographic Atlas inculcated trust into their children. The results reveal that the negative relationship between kinship tightness and
trust was already present in pre-industrial times.
The strong distinction between trust towards in-group and out-group members in

3

tight kinship societies is mirrored in people’s cooperation behavior. Across countries, ancestral kinship tightness is strongly negatively correlated with out-group cooperation,
measured by contributions in an experimental public goods game that was conducted
among students across countries (Herrmann et al., 2008). In addition, ancestral kinship
tightness is positively correlated with cheating on an out-group member in the crosscultural experiments of Gächter and Schulz (2016). But while tight kinship is associated with lower cooperation and more cheating on out-group members, it is strongly
positively associated with cross-country variation in in-group favoritism in the business
domain, i.e., the fraction of management jobs that is assigned based on kin relations
Van de Vliert (2011). Similar results hold within countries: again exploiting variation
across contemporary ethnicities and across second-generation migrants in the World
Values and European Social Surveys, tight kinship is positively correlated with the importance people attach to helping and caring for in-group members, while controlling
for country of residence as well as a host of other covariates.
Next, the paper analyzes the relationship between kinship tightness and the structure of psychological, biological, and institutional enforcement devices, i.e., religious
beliefs, moral values, shame versus guilt, altruistic versus second-party punishment, formal institutions, and social norms. First, the analysis uncovers that historical ethnicities
with strong kinship ties were less likely to honor a moralizing god, consistent with the
idea that moralizing gods are more beneficial in regulating behavior when interactions
are mostly not of a repeated nature.
Second, the analysis documents that kinship tightness is positively related to the
relative importance of “communal” or “tribalistic” over universal moral values. For example, tight kinship societies highly value in-group loyalty, also relative to moral values
that emphasize concepts such as individual harm, rights, and justice. These relationships hold (i) across historical ethnicities by exploiting variation in ethnographic records
of societies’ moral values, (ii) across contemporary countries, and (iii) in within-country
analyses across migrants in the Moral Foundations Questionnaire.
Third, extending the analysis to partly biological aspects, I study the relationship
between kinship tightness and the relative importance of internalized guilt versus external shame. Based on the idea that online searches reveal the subjective importance of
psychological phenomena (Stephens-Davidowitz, 2014), the analysis employs the frequency with which people across countries searched for “shame” or “guilt” on Google
in their respective language as proxy for the relative prominence of these two concepts
in daily life. The results document that, exploiting variation within languages, kinship
tightness is positively related to the relative frequency of googling shame. Moreover,
self-reports contained in cross-cultural psychological questionnaires reveal that people

4

in tight kinship societies perceive emotions of shame as significantly more intense and
long-lasting than feelings of guilt, again in line with the notion that biology is part of the
coevolutionary process that is at the heart of this paper (Wallbott and Scherer, 1995;
Sapolsky, 2017).
Fourth, the analysis relates kinship tightness to the relative prevalence of altruistic
(third-party) and second-party punishment. Consistent with the notion that altruistic
punishment is akin to contributing to an impersonal public good, and should hence
be more prevalent in loose kinship societies, the results document that members of
societies with weak kinship ties are significantly more likely to incur personal costs to
sanction wrongdoing, even without having a personal stake in the issue. In tight kinship
societies, on the other hand, direct revenge-taking is relatively more pronounced.
Fifth, turning to an analysis of institutional structures, the analysis provides evidence that – across historical ethnicities – kinship tightness is negatively related to the
development of large-scale institutions that supersede local groups, such as chiefdoms
or states. At the same time, kinship tightness is positively correlated with the sophistication and power of institutions at the level of local communities, including jurisdictional
hierarchies at the village level.
Sixth, the analysis illuminates the role of conformity to social norms. In contemporary cross-country data, ancestral kinship tightness is strongly related to experimentally measured norm compliance or conformity (Bond and Smith, 1996). In addition,
kinship tightness is positively correlated with the importance of values that mandate
norm adherence: across contemporary countries, within countries across ethnicities in
the World Values Survey, within countries across second-generation migrants in the European Social Survey, and across historical ethnicities is tight kinship associated with
the importance people attach to proper behavior or rule-following.
In sum, the structure of enforcement devices closely corresponds to the observed
cooperation and trust patterns, hence pointing to a coevolution of kinship structures,
cooperation regimes, institutions, and psychological or biological traits. These results
propose a new explanation both for the existence of large cultural variation (“culture”
enforces different cooperation regimes) and for Alesina and Giuliano’s (2015) observation that cultural traits are often correlated (some of them jointly enforce the same
cooperation systems).
The final part of the paper sheds light on the origins of tight kinship and its relation
to economic development. Anthropologists have long argued that kinship tightness is
hump-shaped in societal complexity (Blumberg and Winch, 1972). The gist of the argument is twofold. First, tight kinship is believed to have evolved to serve a functional
role in enabling effective cooperation within suitably defined in-groups for the purposes

5

of agricultural (as opposed to hunter-gatherer) subsistence (Johnson and Earle, 2000;
Gowdy and Krall, 2016). Second, however, tight kinship is believed to have turned
into a sticky disadvantage once technological change required increased specialization,
geographic mobility, and trade with strangers (Henrich, n.d.). While examining the
causal relationships in these accounts is inherently difficult, I provide a series of correlational tests. Consistent with the anthropological narrative, historical ethnicities that
subsisted on agriculture exhibit tighter kinship systems than hunter-gatherers. On the
other hand, ancestral kinship tightness is strongly negatively correlated with contemporary per capita income, and this relation first emerged during the Industrial Revolution.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses related literature. Section 3 lays out the hypothesized relationship between kinship tightness,
cooperation patterns and enforcement devices. Section 4 presents the data. The analysis starts in Section 5 with the relationships between kinship tightness and coperation,
cheating, and trust. Section 6 presents evidence on how kinship tightness is associated
with enforcement devices. Section 7 reports robustness checks. Section 8 discusses the
emergence of tight kinship and its relationship to development. Section 9 concludes.

Related Literature

Behavioral and experimental economists have invested massive efforts into studying
cooperation behavior in different contexts (e.g. Fehr and Gächter, 2000), yet despite
exceptions (Herrmann et al., 2008), understanding the cultural variation in coperation
behavior and enforcement devices has not attracted much attention in this literature.
In cultural economics and political economy, research on social organization and
cooperation started with the classic theoretical treatment of Greif (1994) and Tabellini
(2008b), yet empirical work on cooperation and corresponding enforcement devices
is limited. Instead, research on social structures has focused on the cross-country relationships between contemporary cousin marriages and corruption levels or democracy (Akbari et al., 2016; Schulz, 2016), analyses of how segmentary lineage organization shapes civil conflict and trust in Africa (Moscona et al., 2017a,b), the relationship between matrilineal kinship systems and intra-household bargaining (Lowes,
2017), or studies of the relationship between survey measures of individualism and per
capita income (Gorodnichenko and Roland, 2016). Recent work on (nuclear) family
ties (Bertrand and Schoar, 2006; Alesina and Giuliano, 2013) shares this paper’s focus
on social structures, but differs greatly in terms of substantive focus and measurement.¹
¹Research on the relationship between agriculture and social structures includes Olsson and Paik’s
(2012; 2016) analysis of the role of collectivism in an “agricultural reversal” as well as the contemporary
work by Buggle (2017).

6

More broadly, this paper is part of the literature on cultural variation in economic
preferences and attitudes (Guiso et al., 2009; Algan and Cahuc, 2010; Voigtländer and
Voth, 2012; Chen, 2013; Falk et al., 2016; Dohmen et al., 2016; Desmet et al., Forthcoming), in particular papers that highlight the endogeneity or evolution of cultural
traits (Bisin and Verdier, 2001, 2017; Fernández, 2007; Doepke and Zilibotti, 2014;
Becker et al., 2016; Galor and Özak, 2016; Litina, 2016; Buggle and Durante, 2017).
Finally, the paper is also related to various literatures in moral and cultural psychology and anthropology. While the various – often disjoint – narratives that were
developed in these fields serve as basis for my analysis, my results contribute to this literature by proposing an explicit measurement of kinship tightness as well as a rigorous
and quantitative investigation of the topic in a unified empirical framework.

Research Hypothesis and Background

The various literatures in psychology and anthropology that deal with human cooperation share one aspect in common: they emphasize that enforcing cooperation is not
achieved by any single mechanism, but rather by an entire package of tools. The goal of
this paper is to understand the relationship between kinship systems, cooperation and
corresponding enforcement devices as broadly as possible. Thus, the paper does not
focus on highlighting a single variable or mechanisms, but rather on presenting a comprehensive pattern of correlations that integrate variables and hypotheses from across
the social sciences. This analysis is based on large literatures in cultural psychology and
anthropology.

3.1

Tight Kinship, Cooperation and Trust

For cultural psychologists, the idea that societies exhibit heterogeneity in basic social
organization regarding how deeply people are embedded in cohesive in-groups, is as
basic as the idea that markets equilibrate supply and demand to an economist (Triandis,
1995). In some societies, economic and social life is organized around dense, tightly
structured in-groups that form the basic unit of society. Here, people are said to think
of themselves as “we”: they rely on the in-group for food and other necessities of life in
exchange for unquestioning loyalty. Outsiders to their group (be it the family, extended
family, ethnicity, or village) are considered strangers at best, and enemies at worst.
At the other extreme of the spectrum, psychologists say, lie societies in which people
think of themselves as “I”. Such individuals are said to have weaker personal relationships with in-group members and cannot rely on unconditional loyalty, but at the same

7

time enter productive relationships with people outside their own group. Thus, one expects a negative correlation between kinship tightness and cooperation with (or trust
in) out-group members, but a postive relation between kinship tightness and treating
in-group members well or trusting them.

3.2

Tight Kinship and Enforcement Devices

If it is true that societies exhibit heterogeneous cooperation schemes, it is also conceivable that they have developed different devices to sustain and enforce such cooperation.
Across the social sciences, researchers have proposed various mechanisms to enforce
cooperative behavior, including religious beliefs, moral values, basic emotions and their
physiological consequences, formal institutions, and social norms, some of which predominantly apply to enforcing cooperation within an in-group, or across groups of people. Excellent overviews of (various subsets) of the hypotheses outlined below can be
found in Boyd and Richerson (1988); Fei et al. (1992); Boyd and Richerson (2009);
Greene (2014); Henrich (n.d.). To clarify any potential ambiguity, the hypotheses below are not intended to suggest that kinship systems cause the emergence of certain
institutional or cultural structures – the argument is merely about the coevolution of
social organization, cooperation schemes, and enforcement devices.
Moralizing gods.

Cultural psychologists, anthropologists, historians, and scholars of

religious studies routinely emphasize the importance of religious practices and beliefs in
sustaining cooperation. In this context, moralizing gods are believed to play a key role
(Roes and Raymond, 2003; Norenzayan and Shariff, 2008; Norenzayan, 2013; Botero
et al., 2014). A god is said to be moralizing if they are concerned with and supportive of
human morality by, e.g., punishing wrongdoing or rewarding prosocial behavior.² The
notion that a god is moralizing is often implicit in contemporary discussions because
– mostly due to the spread of the Abrahamic religions Islam and Christianity – today
the vast majority of humans live in a society that honors a moralizing god. However,
historically, this was not the case. Animistic religions, for example, usually featured
gods that were not particularly interested in the actions of mortal humans.
Crucially, moralizing gods are hypothesized to have evolved to solve human social
dilemma problems. In large-scale anonymous societies in which direct enforcement and
punishment is difficult, belief in a moralizing god is helpful because it functions as an
internal “policeman” who punishes human wrongdoing even in the absence of wordly
punishment. But this logic makes it clear that societies with tight kinship ties are in
²Small-scale behavioral experiments have shown that belief in a punitive god is positively correlated
with cooperative behavior (Purzycki et al., 2016; Norenzayan et al., 2016).

8

less need of a moralizing god: because people predominantly interact within their own
group in which personal monitoring is feasible, a moralizing god has a smaller upside,
but presumably the same downside in terms of paying the costs of religious beliefs such
as attending mass and extending sacrifices.
Moral values.

Moral and evolutionary psychologists argue that human morality partly

evolved to solve social dilemma problems by imbuing principles that prevent people
from defecting on others (e.g., Haidt, 2012; Greene, 2014). However, if true, this
implies that moral principles should vary across societies: societies with tight kinship
should have evolved “tribalistic” or “communal” moral values such as in-group loyalty
that sustain in-group cooperation. Those societies with low kinship tightness, on the
other hand, should develop moral principles that apply universally, i.e., equally to everyone. In line with this, moral psychologists have indeed documented cross-cultural
variation in the moral principles people employ, in particular with respect to whether
moral reasoning emphasizes universal moral values or relationship-specific obligations
that predominantly apply to in-groups (Shweder, 1991; Shweder et al., 1997; Fei et
al., 1992; Haidt, 2012). In the words of Shweder (1999), “there is an “ethics of autonomy,” which strongly emphasizes harm, rights, and justice. . . There is an “ethics of
community”, which emphasizes such issues as duty, hierarchy, and interdependency.”³
Shame versus guilt.

Basic emotions and their physiological consequences are concep-

tually very similar to moralizing gods and moral values in that they are internal to an
individual In contrast to these “psychological police officers”, emotions are both psychological and biological in nature. In a by now classic cultural psychology paper, Markus
and Kitayama (1991) argue that cultural contexts that are characterized by cohesive ingroups emphasize emotions that occur between individuals, rather than within a certain
person. In particular, cultural psychologists and anthropologists have long coined the
terms “shame” and “guilt” cultures (Dodds, 1957; Benedict, 1967; Scherer and Wallbott, 1994; Bowles and Gintis, 2003; Gintis, 2003; Wong and Tsai, 2007; Henrich, n.d.)
to draw attention to the notion that societies inculcate different emotional responses
to wrongdoing into their children. In this terminology, guilt refers to something that
is internalized and can be evoked even when nobody knows about the event. Shame,
on the other hand, describes an emotion that is invoked in front of others, presumably in particular those one cares about (in economics terminology, this distinction is
reminiscent of the difference between social and self image). In impersonal exchange
societies, the argument goes, people often engage in anonymous one-shot interactions,
³Haidt (2012) refers to these two different types of values as “individualizing” and “binding”, respectively, because the communal values are said to bind people together into moral groups.

9

so that instilling feelings of shame is less effective than inculcating internalized guilt.
Thus, loose kinship systems should be associated with a more pronounced importance
of guilt relative to shame. Because emotions like shame and guilt also have physiological consequences, this hypothesis implies a coevolution of psychology and biology
(Sapolsky, 2017).
Altruistic punishment.

Across the social sciences, researchers have emphasized the

important role of negative reciprocity in sanctioning wrongdoings. The probably most
important conceptual distinction in the discussion of such punishment patterns is the
extent to which punishment reflects altruistic motives, i.e., the extent to which people
are willing to incur personal costs to punish wrongdoing even if they did not personally
suffer from the misconduct. As is implied in its name, altruistic punishment is conceptually very similar to cooperation behavior itself, because it requires that the punisher
give up private resources to contribute to a common good, i.e., preventing the villain
from future misbehavior. From this discussion, it follows immediately that altruistic
punishment should be higher in loose kinship societies. After all, if an individual in a
tight kinship society is unconcerned with the well-being of an out-group member, then
why would they incur personal costs to sanction someone who mistreated them? In contrast, punishment patterns in tight kinship societies should be characterized by a higher
prevalence of direct punishment and revenge-taking, i.e., second-party punishment.
Institutions and social norms.

Differences in social organization should go hand in

hand with the development of institutions and social norms, where I will speak of norms
simply as a less formal way to regulate behavior than through laws and courts. If people
mainly interact with in-group members and everybody outside of that group is considered an enemy, then there is less of a need to bear the cost of setting up large-scale
formal enforcement institutions that supersede each separate group. Instead, such societies have incentives to develop strong institutions at the local level. That is, this perspective suggests that kinship tightness is negatively correlated with the development
of formal institutions above the level of an in-group, but positively correlated with the
development of institutions at the local level, including the strength of and conformity
to informal social norms.
To sum up the discussion, Table 1 presents an overview of the hypotheses underlying
the empirical analysis.

Measure of Kinship Tightness

Cultural psychologists and anthropologists agree that the single most important aspect
of people’s in-group ties are their kin relations. Kinship describes the system of procreative relationships in society. It clarifies what rights and obligations people have, and
oftentimes even constitutes the foundation of people’s social lifes (Schultz and Lavenda,
2005). Accordingly, this paper measures social organization by developing an index of
historical kinship tightness. In contrast to the more qualitative survey-based approach of
psychologists, this measure is based on observable characteristics and is hence arguably
amenable to direct interpretation.
The measure of kinship tightness is based on variables in the Ethnographic Atlas
(EA), an ethnicity-level dataset that contains detailed information on the living conditions and social structures of 1,265 ethnic groups prior to industrialization (Murdock,
1967). The EA is arguably the leading collection of anthropological knowledge on historical ethnicities. Murdock constructed the data by coding ethnicities for the earliest
period for which ethnographic data is available or can be reconstructed from written
records. The average year of observation is 1898, but even for those ethnicities for which
information was sampled during the 20th century, the data are meant to describe living
conditions prior to intense European contact or industrialization.⁴ Following work in
ethnography, Giuliano and Nunn (2017) extend this dataset by additionally including
⁴The year of observation is only weakly and insignificantly correlated with the index of kinship
tightness that I develop below (ρ = 0.04).

11

46 ethnicities to broaden coverage in Europe. The EA contains information on mode
of subsistence (agriculture, animal husbandry, hunting, gathering, and fishing), family structure and community organization, religious beliefs, language, and institutions,
among others. In fact, for a subset of 186 ethnicities – the so-called Standard CrossCultural Sample (SCCS) – very detailed ethnographic information on local customs,
beliefs etc. is available.⁵
The dimensions that cultural anthropologists use to classify the nature of kinship
systems are textbook knowledge. This paper closely follows the – largely overlapping
– discussions in Parkin (1997), Haviland (2002), Schultz and Lavenda (2005), and
Henrich (n.d.). At a broad level, kin relations describe patterns of relatedness as they
arise through mating and birth. Dimensions of kinship can hence be partitioned into (i)
family structure, (ii) marriage patterns, and (iii) descent systems (Parkin, 1997; Schultz
and Lavenda, 2005). For each of these categories, I identify those two variables in the
EA that are closest to the presentations in Haviland (2002) and Henrich (n.d.); this is
straightforward given that these discussions are based on the terminology or even data
in the EA:
1. Family structure
(a) Domestic organization. A key distinction in anthropological research is the
presence of independent nuclear versus extended families. I generate a binary variable that equals zero if the domestic organization is around independent nuclear families and one otherwise (Q8 in the EA).
(b) Post-wedding residence. Post-marital residence varies widely across cultures.
Anthropologists argue that close kinship ties are indicated by social norms
that prescribe residence with the husband’s (or the wife’s) group. Weak kinship ties, on the other hand, are indicated by couples either living by themselves or flexibly with either the wife’s or the husband’s group. Accordingly,
I generate a variable that equals 1 if the wife is expected to move in with
the husband’s group or vice versa, and 0 otherwise (Q11).
2. Marriage patterns
(a) Cousin marriage. Endogamous marriage, i.e., marriage within in-groups is
believed to be a key characteristic of tight kinship, and the most important
⁵Murdock assembled the EA by relying on the records of different ethnographers, so that that Murdock’s own predispositions are unlikely to be a major source of bias in the dataset. In addition, many
of the theoretical developments in cultural psychology and anthropology that link social structure to
enforcement devices took place relatively recently and are hence implausible to have affected ethnographers’ perceptions during the time of coding.

12

case of this is cousin marriage (also see Schulz, 2016). While many cultures
allow marriage among (certain) first- or second-degree cousins, others do
not. I construct a three-step index that equals one if marrying first-degree
cousins is allowed, 0.5 if marriage among second-degree cousins is allowed,
and zero otherwise (Q24). Since this variable is missing for 253 ethnicities in
the EA (which leads to a loss of more than a dozen countries), I supplement
this variable with information on local kin terminology (Q27). Anthropologists have long noted that those cultures that allow cousin marriage tend to
make a linguistic distinction between those cousins that can be married and
those that cannot. Thus, information on kin terms can be used to impute
levels of cousin marriage for those ethnicities for which the cousin marriage
variable is missing.⁶
(b) Polygamy. Polygamy is argued to support strong kinship ties because it allows
the building of large interconnected families. For example, if a man has
several wives and children from all of them, then in a patrilineal society the
children would all be considered part of the same lineage, even though they
have different mothers. To capture this aspect of kinship systems, I code a
variable that equals 0 if polygamy is absent and 1 otherwise (Q9).
3. Descent systems
(a) Lineages. Descent groups are defined by people’s ancestry. Key defining characteristic of a descent system is whether it features unilineal or bilateral
descent groups. Unilineal descent systems track descent primarily through
one line as opposed to through both lines, and are said to induce particularly strong and cohesive in-groups because they make people feel close to
a particular part of the family. A lineage is hence a group of people who
trace descent to a known common ancestor (alive or dead), i.e., people who
can specify the links that unite them. Such groups are typically much larger
than Western notions of “the family” and can be composed of more than
1,000 people. In contrast, bilateral systems such as in large parts of Western Europe are ego-oriented, meaning that everybody relates to a different
family, which is believed to prevent the build-up of extended tight linkages.
I construct a variable that equals 0 if descent is bilateral, and 1 otherwise
(Q43).
⁶Specifically, for each of eight different kin terminology systems, I compute the average cousin marriage index described in the main text for all societies in the EA that have information on both Q24
and Q27. Then, I assign this index of “expected cousin marriage” to those ethnicities for which cousin
marriage information is missing, based on their respective kin terminology. All main results in the paper
are robust to excluding cousin marriage from the construction of the kinship tightness index altogether.

13

(b) Segmented communities and localized clans. When lineage systems become
too large to be tractable and memorized, they split into new, smaller lineages.
In such cases, people across lineages continue to recognize their “broad relatedness” even though they could not describe the specific path that connects them. Such systems are called clans. Clans are more or less closely
interconnected, partly depending on whether clans determine geographical
residency as opposed to being geographically dispersed. Accordingly, I code
a variable that equals one if a clan takes the form of localized clans that live
as segmented communities in, e.g., clan barrios, and zero otherwise (Q15).
In sum, this paper characterizes kinship systems through a set of six variables. To
aggregate these dimensions of kinship tightness, I compute the first principal component.⁷ This score endogenously has the appealing property that it loads to a substantial
extent on all six of the above variables in a direction that is consistent with anthropological notions of tight kinship.⁸ The index loads negatively on independent nuclear
families (weight 0.35), negatively on neolocal residence (0.42), positively on cousin
marriage (0.19), positively on polygamy (0.34), negatively on bilateral descent (0.54),
and positively on the presence of segmented communities or clans (0.50).⁹ The resulting Kinship Tightness Index (KTI) is normalized to be in [0, 1]. Figure 7 in Appendix B
depicts the distribution of the kinship tightness index at the level of 989 historical ethnicities for which data on all six dimensions are available.¹⁰

4.2

Additional Data Sources and Nature of Variation

The measure of kinship tightness can be utilized to exploit variation across historical
ethnicities. In addition, the data can be matched to contemporary populations, hence
allowing for contemporary cross-country, cross-ethnicity, and cross-migrant analyses.
To facilitate a comprehensive analysis of cooperation patterns and enforcement devices,
⁷Principal component analysis constructs a set of uncorrelated principal components from the observations such that the first principal component accounts for as much of the variance in the data as
possible. Each succeeding component is then constructed to also explain as much of the variance as
possible, conditional on being orthogonal to all previous principal components.
⁸This first component has an eigenvalue of 2.10, whereas that of the second component is 1.07. This
second component is difficult to interpret given its weights. For example, it loads positively on cousin
marriage, but also positively on bilateral descent and nuclear families, a combination that is hard to
reconcile with anthropological notions of tight kinship.
⁹To interpret these weights, recall that all six variables are in [0,1].
¹⁰Table 14 in Appendix A documents that the country-level index of kinship tightness is positively
correlated with measures of collectivism (vs. individualism) that people have previously employed, including the collectivism vs. individualism index of Hofstede (1984), a measure of family ties by Alesina
and Giuliano (2013), and the fraction of the population speaking a language that allows dropping the
pronoun (Tabellini, 2008a).

14

the analysis links the kinship tightness index to various cross-cultural datasets such as
experiments, surveys, and ethnographic records. Thus, most of the dependent variables
are independent from the sampling and coding scheme in the EA. Appendix C provides
a detailed description of all variables used in this study.
Cross-Country.

Giuliano and Nunn (2017) propose a method to match the historical

ethnicities in the EA to contemporary populations using the language people speak. Appendix C.3.1 provides a desciption of this matching procedure. Following their methodology, Figure 1 depicts the country-level distribution of historical kinship tightness, as
it applies to contemporary populations.¹¹ The color coding roughly corresponds to the
seven-quantiles of the distribution of kinship tightness. Evidently, kinship tightness exhibits geographic clustering: with a few exceptions, Western Europe and their offshoots
have loose ancestral kinship ties, whereas parts of Eastern Europe, Asia, and Africa exhibit substantial variation. South America lies in between Western Europe and Asia or
Africa. The analysis will link this variation to data on behavioral experiments, surveys,
and language use across countries. In light of the geographical clustering of kinship
tightness, the analysis will include within-country regressions to alleviate potential
concerns about cross-country results. In addition, cross-country analyses will control
for continent fixed effects.
World Values Survey: Ethnicities Within Countries.

The World Values Survey (WVS)

contains information on respondents’ ethnicity. While these data are often very coarse,
111 ethnicities in 41 countries were described in sufficiently great detail for me to be
able to match a total of 45,958 respondents to their ancestors in the EA. Thus, I can
investigate the relationship between ancestral kinship tightness and respondents’ trust
or values by exploiting variation across contemporary ethnicities within countries.
European Social Survey: Second-Generation Migrants.

The European Social Sur-

vey (ESS) provides detailed information on the migration background of respondents’
parents. Thus, following Giuliano (2007) and Fernández (2007), I can study the relationship between people’s values and the kinship tightness of their ancestors by computing the average kinship tightness index across the country of origin of father and
mother (where the country-level data are computed as described above). That is, in
these analyses, the sample is restricted to respondents who were born in the country
¹¹In cases in which the kinship tightness index is missing for the dominant ethnicity in a country, the
country-level score is based on ethnicities that account for only a relatively small share of the population.
I have verified that excluding all countries in which this is the case has only very minor, if any, effects
on coefficient estimates and significance levels in the cross-country regressions. Figure 9 in Appendix B
provides a map of the kinship tightness index that accounts for these populations.

Figure 1: Distribution of kinship tightness across countries

of current residence, yet their ancestral kinship tightness varies because of the parents’
migratory background. Thus, similarly to the cross-ethnicity analysis in the WVS, this
analysis identifies pure within-country correlates of kinship tightness. In total, I can
make use of 319,137 respondents in 32 countries of residence. Of these, 42,962 people
are second-generation migrants (with respect to at least one parent); their fathers and
mothers migrated from 184 and 186 countries of birth, respectively.
Global Preference Survey and Moral Foundations Questionnaire: Migrants.

The

Global Preference Survey is a survey dataset on economic preferences from representative population samples in 76 countries (Falk et al., 2016). The data include information on respondents’ country of birth. Thus, similarly to the ESS, I can leverage withincountry variation in kinship tightness by relating people’s preferences to the ancestral
kinship tightness in their country of birth. In total, I can make use of 68,601 respondents in 66 countries of residence for which information on migration background is
available. Of these people, 3,341 are migrants from 148 different countries of birth.
The Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ) is a psychological questionnaire on
moral values (Graham et al., 2012). The authors uploaded this questionnaire to www.
yourmorals.org in 2008, where thousands of people have completed the question-

16

naire and provided basic background information including their country of birth. The
sample of respondents is purely based on self-selection and hence not representative of
a country’s population. At the same time, I am not aware of reasons why the nature of
differential self-selection into the survey across countries or groups of migrants should
bias the results in favor of my research hypothesis, as opposed to just inducing measurement error. Similarly to the GPS, the MFQ allows to leverage within-country variation in
kinship tightness by relating people’s moral values to the ancestral kinship tightness in
their country of birth. In total, I have access to 285,792 respondents from 206 countries
of residence, of which 26,657 are immigrants from 199 different countries of birth.

Tight Kinship, Cooperation and Trust
Empirical Approach and Covariates

To study the relationship between kinship tightness, cooperation, trust and enforcement devices, the analysis leverages variation across countries, within countries across
ethnicities, within countries across migrants, and across historical ethnicities. For each
concept, I will work at one or more levels of analysis, depending on data availability.
Contemporary Cross-Country. In cross-country analyses, I present multiple specifications for each dependent variable if feasible given the respective number of observations. Depending on the specification, I make use of three sets of covariates: (i) control
variables for ancestral characteristics of contemporary populations from the EA, i.e., historical dependence on agriculture, number of jurisdictional hierachies above the local
level, and year of observation; (ii) additional country-level covariates, including distance from the equator, log land suitability for agriculture, and ancestry-adjusted log
population density in 1500; (iii) continent fixed effects and colonizer fixed effects (to
capture potential cultural transmission). Section 7 reports robustness checks.
Contemporary Within-Country. The contemporary within-country analyses are all
based on large-scale surveys. Here, I control for both individual-level variables (age,
age squared, gender, and education) and characteristics of the groups based on which
the kinship tightness index is assigned to a given individual. That is, in analyses that
leverage variation across ethnicities, I control for the following historical characteristics
of ethnicities: dependence on agriculture, number of jurisdictional hierachies above the
local level, distance from the equator, and year of observation in the EA. In analyses
that leverage variation across migrants, I control for the same characteristics of the
respondent’s (or their parent’s) country of birth as in the cross-country analyses.
17

Historical Cross-Ethnicity.

In historical analyses, I make use of background informa-

tion in the EA on subsistence mode (e.g., dependence on agriculture), number of jurisdictional hierachies above the local level, settlement complexity, year of observation,
distance from the equator, longitude, and elevation.
In all analyses, unless noted otherwise, the dependent variable is transformed into
a z-score, so that OLS coefficients can be easily interpreted: a coefficient of x means
that increasing kinship tightness from its minimum of zero to its maximum of one is
associated with an increase of x% of a standard deviation in the dependent variable.
To keep the exposition concise, tables do not report the coefficients of covariates.

5.2

The Radius of Trust

Researchers in economics have long used beliefs about whether “people in general” can
be trusted to measure the extent to which people are likely to effectively cooperate with
others (Knack and Keefer, 1997; Glaeser et al., 2000). I hence start by considering this
well-known and commonly used proxy for societal cooperation, before moving on to
study less widely used, but more direct, data on cooperation behavior.
To study the relationship between kinship tightness and trust, I rely on both the “general trust” question in the World Values Survey (WVS) and six additional trust questions
that got added to the WVS more recently. These more specific questions ask respondents
for their level of trust in their family, their neighbors, people they know, people they
meet for the first time, people of another religion, and foreigners, respectively (Delhey
et al., 2011). These data will allow to evaluate people’s trust radius.
The analysis starts with OLS cross-country regressions which relate the different
trust variables to kinship tightness, with and without covariates. Columns (1)–(3) of
Table 2 reveal that kinship tightness is negatively associated with trust in people in
general.¹² To disaggregate this result and develop deeper insights into people’s trust
radius, I consider levels of trust in specific groups. I omit “trust in family” due to a ceiling
effect: on a four-point scale, the average trust in family across countries is 3.80. But
while all societies seem to trust their own family, systematic patterns hold regarding
the other groups. Columns (4) through (8) show that kinship tightness is positively
correlated with trust in neighbors, but negatively with trust in all other groups. Also, as
the analysis successively moves to more “distant” forms of out-group members (from left
to right in Table 2), the point estimate monotonically decreases in size and eventually
becomes highly statistically significant.
¹²The Global Preference Survey (Falk et al., 2016) likewise contains a question that elicits a concept
related to genral trust, by asking respondents to state their agreement with the statement: “I assume
that people have only the best intentions.” Responses to this question are likewise significantly negatively
correlated with kinship tightness, ρ = −0.25, p < 0.05.

General trust

Notes. Individual-level OLS estimates in the WVS / ESS, standard errors in parentheses. In columns (1)–(4),
the sample consists of individuals in the WVS. The dependent variables are people’s generalized trust and
the difference in trust between family, neighbors and people one knows on the one hand, and all other three
groups on the other hand, compare Table 2. The standard errors are clustered at the ethnicity level. Individual
level controls include gender, age, age squared, and educational attainment. Ethnicity level controls include
dependence on agriculture, number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchies above the local level, distance from
the equator, and year of observation in the EA. In columns (5)–(6), the sample includes individuals in the
ESS and the standard errors are clustered at the level of the country of birth of the father times the country
of birth of the mother. Individual level controls include gender, age, age squared, years of education, and a
second-generation migrant dummy. Country of origin controls include dependence on agriculture, number of
levels of jurisdictional hierarchies above the local level, and year of observation (all from the EA, but computed as pertaining to contemporary populations) as well as distance from the equator, log land suitability for
agriculture, and ancestry-adjusted log population density in 1500. All dependent variables are expressed as
z-scores. ∗ p < 0.10, ∗∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗∗ p < 0.01.

To draw out the distinction between trust in in-group and out-group even more
clearly, I construct a variable of difference in trust between in- and out-group. For this
purpose, I add up trust in family, neighbors and people one knows and then subtract
trust in all other groups. As columns (9)–(11) show, kinship tightness is strongly and
significant correlated with this measure of the radius of trust. The left panel of Figure 2
visualizes the relationship between kinship tightness and the difference between ingroup and out-group trust.
To investigate whether these results might be spuriously driven by omitted crosscountry variables, the analysis proceeds with within-country regressions. For this purpose, I again make use of variation (i) across ethnicities in the WVS and (ii) across
second-generation migrants in the ESS. Table 3 presents the results, which mirror those
established in the cross-country analysis. In the WVS, columns (1)–(4), the point estimates suggest that people exhibit lower trust in people in general, yet this correlation is
not statistically significant. However, kinship tightness is significantly related to larger

20

differences between in- and out-group trust. Table 15 in Appendix A shows that the latter result again hides the fact that kinship tightness is positively correlated with trust in
neighbors, yet negatively with trust in strangers. Columns (5) and (6) show that similar
results obtain in the ESS using the general trust question. Here, an individual’s trust
is strongly and significantly negatively correlated with the average ancestral kinship
tightness of the countries of birth of father and mother, conditional on a large set of
individual-level controls as well as country of origin controls of the country of birth of
father and mother. In sum, even though the nature of variation differs in various ways
– across countries, across ethnicities, and across second-generation migrants – do the
results consistently point to a relationship between kinship tightness and contemporary
trust levels.
In a final step, the analysis provides evidence that tight kinship ties were already
negatively correlated with trust levels in historical ethnicities. For a subset of societies
in the Ethnographic Atlas, the so-called Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (SCCS), very
detailed information on the practices and values of historical ethnicities are available,
based on the records of ethnographers. Ross (1983) coded an eleven-step variable that
describes the extent to which parents in the respective ethnicity inculcated trust into
their children. For the lack of more detailed information, I interpret this abstract trust
variable as being similar to the “general trust” question in the WVS, i.e., that it describes
trust levels in other people in general, as opposed to in the family or neighbors only.
To reiterate, these types of variables reflect the impressions of ethnographers of values
and beliefs in the respective communities; while such variables are probably noisy, I am
not aware of reasons to expect that they are somehow biased in favor of the research
hypothesis. To conserve space, I present these results as part of Table 6 below. Columns
(1) and (2) provide evidence that the trust variable is negatively correlated with kinship
tightness, which is reminiscent of the correlations found in contemporary data.

5.3

Cooperation, Cheating and In-Group Favoritism

To complement the analysis of people’s beliefs with evidence on their behaviors, the
analysis continues by investigating the relationship between historical kinship tightness and contemporary behaviors pertaining to cooperation, cheating, and in-group
favoritism. First, Herrmann et al. (2008) conducted public goods games across 15 countries in which participants were students and hence presumably strangers to each other,
or at least not in-group members.¹³ My dependent variables are (i) initial contribution
¹³The cross-cultural public goods games run by Henrich and collaborators are less useful for my purposes because they were administered on small-scale societies that may have had little cultural overlap
with the majority of the population of the country they reside in (Henrich et al., 2001, 2010).

Cheating

Notes. Country-level OLS estimates, robust standard errors in parentheses. The dependent variables in
columns (1) and (2) are initial contribution levels in the PGG of Herrmann et al. (2008) in the treatments without (NOP) and with availability of punishment (P), respectively. In column (3), contribution
levels are averaged across both conditions and all ten periods of the PGG. In columns (4)–(5), the dependent variable is the average monetary payout subjects reported in the lying game of Gächter and Schulz
(2016). In columns (6)–(8), the dependent variable is the fraction of jobs that is assigned based on kinship
(Van de Vliert, 2011). All dependent variables are expressed as z-scores. EA controls include dependence
on agriculture, number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchies above the local level, and year of observation
(all computed as pertaining to contemporary populations). Other controls include distance from the equator, log land suitability for agriculture, and ancestry-adjusted log population density in 1500. ∗ p < 0.10,

levels in an experimental treatment without availability of punishment, (ii) initial contribution levels in a treatment with punishment, and (iii) average contribution levels
across conditions and periods. Second, Gächter and Schulz (2016) conducted an experimental cheating game across 23 countries in which participants could lie to the
experimenter – an out-group member – to increase their monetary reward. I use average lying levels as proxy for cheating behavior. Third, while the aforementioned experimental games capture the treatment of out-group members, a survey conducted among
managers in large firms gives insights into people’s preferential treatment of in-group
members (Van de Vliert, 2011). Here, managers in large companies were asked which
fraction of management jobs in their company is assigned based on kin relationships as
opposed to personal qualifications.
Table 4 presents the results from OLS estimations. Columns (1)–(3) document that
country-level ancestral kinship tightness is negatively correlated with contributions in
a public goods game, hence providing evidence that societies with strong kinship ties
are less cooperative when interacting with out-group members. Columns (4) and (5)
establish that kinship tightness is positively associated with cheating on an out-group
member in a lying game. The right panel of Figure 2 visualizes the relationship between
kinship tightness and cheating behavior. While these behavioral tendencies suggest that

Figure 2: Relationship between kinship tightness and the difference between in-group and out-group
trust in the WVS (left panel) and between kinship tightness and cheating in a lying game (Gächter
and Schulz, 2016, left panel). Both plots are partial correlation plots conditional on the vector of “EA
controls”, compare column (5) of Table 4.

social structures that are characterized by tight kinship have detrimental consequences
for interactions among out-group members, the opposite holds true for in-group interactions. As columns (6)–(8) show, kinship tightness is significantly positively related
to nepotism in the business domain. Here, the larger number of observations allows to
condition on the full set of covariates described above, including continent fixed effects
and colonizer fixed effects.
Table 4 has provided evidence for a cross-country difference in how members of tight
kinship societies treat in- and out-group members. Table 5 shows that – analogously to
the cross-country findings – tight ancestral kinship is also postively associated with
people’s willingness to help in-group members within countries. For this purpose, the
analysis exploits individual-level variation in ancestral kinship tightness in the WVS and
ESS. In these analyses, the unit of observation is always an individual, yet the kinship
tightness index is assigned (i) based on the ethnicity of the respondent (WVS) or (ii)
based on the respondents’ parents’ countries of birth (ESS).
Both the WVS and the ESS ask respondents how important it is for them to help
people around them and to care for their well-being. I interpret these survey questions as asking about respondents’ attitudes towards their in-group.¹⁴ Columns (1)–(2)
establish that ancestral kinship tightness is positively correlated with the importance
people attach to helping in-group members in the WVS. This relationship holds conditioning on individual-level covariates (age, age squared, gender, and education) as
well as historical ethnicity-level controls from the EA, including dependence on agricul¹⁴The WVS also contains a question that asks people how important it is for them to “do something
for the good of society”. This question is arguably difficult to interpret given that “society” could pertain
either to the local community or to, e.g., the country as a whole. In any case, in analogous regressions to
columns (1) and (2) of Table 5, kinship tightness is significantly positively correlated with this variable.

Notes. Individual-level OLS estimates in the WVS / ESS, standard errors in parentheses. In columns

attach to helping others nearby. The standard errors are clustered at the ethnicity level. Individual level
controls include gender, age, age squared, and educational attainment. Ethnicity level controls include
dependence on agriculture, number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchies above the local level, distance
from the equator, and year of observation in the EA. In columns (3)–(4), the sample includes individuals
in the ESS and the standard errors are clustered at the level of the country of birth of the father times
the country of birth of the mother. Individual level controls include gender, age, age squared, years of
education, and a second-generation migrant dummy. Country of origin controls include dependence on
agriculture, number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchies above the local level, and year of observation

Columns (3) and (4) show that similar results obtain in the ESS. Here, the importance
individuals attach to “helping people around him or her” and to “care for their wellbeing” is significantly positively correlated with the average ancestral kinship tightness
of the countries of birth of father and mother. Again, this relationship holds conditional
on individual-level covariates as well as country of origin controls that control for the
(average) characteristics of the country of birth of father and mother. These controls
include ancestral characteristics of contemporary populations from the EA, i.e., historical dependence on agriculture, number of jurisdictional hierachies above the local level,
and year of observation in the EA. In addition, the country of origin controls include
distance from the equator, log land suitability for agriculture, and ancestry-adjusted
log population density in 1500.
In sum, the cross-country and within-country results on people’s experimental behaviors, willingness to help others, and trust beliefs draw a consistent picture. Tight

Notes. Historical ethnicity-level OLS estimates, robust standard errors in parentheses. In
columns (1)–(2), the dependent variable is a categorical 11-step variable that describes
the extent to which ethnicities inculcated trust in their children. The dependent variable
in columns (3)–(4) is an indicator for whether the ethnicity had a moralizing god. In
columns (5)–(6), the dependent variable is the extent to which people are loyal towards
their local community. All dependent variables are expressed as z-scores. In column (4), the
historical controls include dependence on agriculture, dependence on animal husbandry,
year of observation, settlement complexity, number of jurisdictional hierarchies above the
local level, distance from the equator, longitude, and average elevation. Due to the smaller
number of observations, the historical controls in columns (2) and (6) only include distance
from the equator, longitude, average elevation, and number of jurisdictional hierarchies
above the local level. ∗ p < 0.10, ∗∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗∗ p < 0.01.

kinship is associated with low cooperativeness and trust towards the out-group, but
in-group favoritism and strong trust in the in-group, while loose kinship societies cooperate relatively well with out-group members and do not disproportionately favor
or trust in-group over out-group members. The analysis now turns to studying the enforcement devices that are associated with these two different systems.

Enforcement Devices

6.1

Moralizing Gods

The relationship between the presence of a moralizing god and kinship tightness cannot
be meaningfully studied in contemporary data because – due to the spread of Christianity and Islam – the vast majority of human societies today honor a moralizing god. However, in the EA, only 26% of historical ethnicities are coded as believing in a moralizing
god.
Columns (3) and (4) of Table 6 study the relationship between religious beliefs and
kinship tightness in the EA. The dependent variable is a (standardized) binary indicator
that equals one if a society has a moralizing god and zero otherwise, i.e., if the society
25

has no high god or a god that is not moralizing (Q34 in the EA). The results show that
societies with high kinship tightness were significantly less likely to develop beliefs in a
moralizing god. This result holds up against a large and comprehensive vector of control
variables that account for pre-industrial heterogeneity in subsistence style, settlement
patterns, year of observation in the EA, geography, as well as continent fixed effects.¹⁵

6.2.1

Moral Values: Tribalistic vs. Universal Moral Principles
Moral Values: Evidence from Historical Ethnicities

To study of the link between the structure of moral values and kinship tightness, the
analysis again makes use of the detailed information contained in the SCCS. Specifically, a variable (Q778) measures the extent to which people are loyal to their local
community on a scale of 1–4. According to Ross (1983), who assembled these data, this
variable is meant to measure the degree of in-group loyalty and “we” feelings. Columns
(5)–(6) of Table 6 present the results. Loyalty to the local community is significantly
increasing in kinship tightness, both with and without covariates.
6.2.2

Moral Values: Contemporary Evidence

In a second step, the analysis investigates the relationship between ancestral kinship
tightness and contemporary values, both across and within countries. For this purpose,
I exploit variation in universal vs. tribalistic moral principles in the MFQ, which was
specifically designed to measure variation in moral principles that go beyond traditional notions of distributional fairness, reciprocity, and not harming others. In particular, building on research in cultural anthropology (Shweder et al., 1997), the moral
psychologist Haidt (2012) and his collaborators noticed that while the previously mentioned dimensions are moral principles that are meant to apply universally to everyone,
other moral principles such as in-group loyality or submitting to authorities refer to
relationship-specific obligations, i.e., to moral rules that differ depending on the person
concerned. The latter types of values have also been referred to as “communal” or “tribalistic”. The MFQ contains survey-based measures of five “moral foundations”: fairness
/ reciprocity, harm / care, in-group loyalty, respect / authority, and purity. For example,
the in-group loyalty dimension includes an item that asks respondents to indicate their
agreement with the statement “People should be loyal to their family members, even
when they have done something wrong”, see Appendix C for details.
¹⁵Table 16 in Appendix A shows that similar results hold when I restrict the sample of ethnicities to
(i) societies that have a high god or (ii) continents that were largely not influenced by the Abrahamic
religions at the time of recording (Christianity, Islam, Judaism), i.e., the Americas and Oceania.

Rel. imp. tribalistic values

Notes. Country-level OLS estimates, robust standard errors in parentheses. The
dependent variable in columns (1)–(3) is the in-group loyalty dimension in the
MFQ. In columns (4)–(6), I compute the relative importance of universally applicable values by adding the MFQ dimensions of fairness / reciprocity and harm
/ care and subtracting in-group loyalty and submission to authority. The sample
is restricted to countries with at least 18 respondents in the MFQ, which corresponds to the 25th percentile of the distribution. Table 18 in Appendix A reports
a robustness check that includes the full sample of countries, and weights each
observation by the number of respondents. EA controls include dependence on
agriculture, number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchies above the local level,
and year of observation (all computed as pertaining to contemporary populations). Other controls include distance from the equator, log land suitability for
agriculture, and ancestry-adjusted log population density in 1500. ∗ p < 0.10, ∗∗
p < 0.05, ∗∗∗ p < 0.01.

In line with the research hypothesis discussed in Section 3, the analysis employs
two dependent variables, i.e., (i) the measure of in-group loyalty, and (ii) an index of
the importance of universal values relative to the more “communal” ones. That is, the
hypothesis is explicitly not about some societies being more or less moral than others,
but merely about heterogeneity in the relative importance that people attach to structurally different types of values. To construct the index, I compute the first principal
component of fairness / reciprocity, harm / care, in-group / loyalty, and respect / authority. The resulting score endogenously has the appealing property that – in line with
the research hypothesis – the index loads positively on the first two values and negatively on the latter two, see Appendix C for details. Since purity relates to the religious
domain, it is not directly related to the research question pursued here.¹⁶ I compute
country-level scores by averaging responses by country of residence of respondents.
Table 7 presents the cross-country results. Kinship tightness is strongly and significantly correlated with in-group loyalty as well as the relative importance of tribalistic
vs. universal moral values. The left panel of Figure 3 depicts the relationship between

Table 8 presents analogous within-country analyses in the MFQ. These regressions
leverage variation in the country of birth of respondents, conditional on the same country of residence. The regressions control for both individual-level covariates (age, age
squared, gender, education) and country of origin controls. Across specifications and
dependent variables, kinship tightness is significantly correlated with moral values.

Emotions: Shame versus Guilt

Measuring the relative importance of different emotions across cultures requires nonstandard data. First, I make use of ISEAR, i.e., the “International Survey on Emotion
Antecedents and Reactions” (Scherer et al., 1986; Scherer and Wallbott, 1994). This
dataset consists of responses to a psychological questionnaire on how university students across cultures experience emotions (N = 2, 921; 37 countries). Among other
questions, respondents were asked to describe a situation in which they experienced
shame and guilt, respectively. Then, for each emotion, they were asked to describe how
long-lasting (minutes, an hour, several hours, a day or more) and how intense (not very,
moderately, intense, very) the feeling was.¹⁷ I convert responses to these questions to
a scale of 1–4, respectively. Then, I compute the difference in intensity and length between shame and guilt, respectively, and average these two differences to arrive at an
¹⁷The ISEAR questionnaire contains many more detailed questions, including about shame and guilt.
The two questions that I use are the ones that are asked initially and represent the broadest assessment.
Follow-up questions, which I have not analyzed, include detailed questions about the physiological symptoms and expressive behaviors that were associated with or followed the emotion.

individual-level summary statistic of the relative (self-reported) strength of shame over
guilt. A country-level index is then computed as average across respondents.¹⁸
In addition, I develop a second measure of the relative importance of shame and
guilt, which does not rely on self-reports. I explore how often people across cultures
think about shame and guilt by analyzing how often they entered the respective term
into Google (Stephens-Davidowitz, 2014). Google Trends allows to assess this frequency
relative to overall search volume, separately for each country. To avoid a potential bias
that might arise by comparing search behavior across different languages, the analysis only relies on within-language variation. Accordingly, I restrict attention to languages that are an official language in at least two countries (since otherwise no withinlanguage variation can be exploited) and that are covered in the linguistic study of Jaffe
et al. (2014), so I have access to translations for shame and guilt. To take English as
an example, I entered “guilt” and “shame” separately into Google trends and recorded
how often (relative to total search volume) people across countries searched for either
concept in the last five years. I repeated the same procedure for each language in the

the cross-cultural indices of Hofstede (1984).

Notes. Country-level OLS estimates, robust standard errors in parentheses. In columns (1)–(3), the dependent
variable is the difference between the relative frequency of Google searches for shame and guilt in a given

on agriculture, number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchies above the local level, and year of observation (all
computed as pertaining to contemporary populations). Other controls include distance from the equator, log

consideration set. In total, I gathered data on search frequency in 59 country-language
pairs (consisting of 9 languages and 56 countries) and computed the difference in word
use between shame and guilt.¹⁹ Importantly, this procedure implies that any noise or
bias in the construction of the language variable that operates at the level of languages
(say, through translation) is netted out because in the empirical analysis I only compare
populations that speak the same language.
Table 9 presents the results. Columns (1) and (2) document that kinship tightness is
positively correlated with the relative strength of feelings of shame over guilt, according
to the self-reports of respondents in ISEAR. Columns (4)–(6) exploit variation within
languages (by including language fixed effects) in search behavior on Google. I find
that kinship tightness is significantly correlated with the relative importance of shame,
also conditional on controls. The right panel of Figure 3 visualizes this correlation.

6.4

Altruistic Punishment

To study people’s punishment patterns across societies, I focus on the difference between altruistic and other forms of punishment, as discussed in the research hypothesis. For this purpose, the analysis employs two dependent variables. First, I consider
observed punishment patterns in the cross-cultural public goods games of Herrmann
et al. (2008). Here, I compute as dependent variable the difference between altruistic
and antisocial punishment, i.e., the difference in punishment in cases in which the punisher contributed more and less than the punished participant, respectively. Second, the
analysis makes use of the preference measures on negative reciprocity in the GPS. The
GPS explicitly includes survey items to measure both people’s propensity for altruistic
punishment (“How willing are you to punish someone who treats others unfairly, even
if there may be costs for you?”) and for second-party punishment. I again compute the
difference between these variables, see Appendix C for details.
Columns (6)–(9) of Table 9 document that kinship tightness is negatively correlated
with the prevalence of altruistic punishment, relative to other forms of punishment. This
result holds both using punishment data in the PGG and in the GPS. The latter result
is visualized in the left panel of Figure 4.
Table 10 provides ancillary regressions using within-country data from the GPS.
Here, the dependent variable is again the difference between altruistic and secondparty punishment, yet the analysis exploits individual-level variation in ancestral kinship tightness across countries of residence, holding fixed respondents’ country of residence as well as other covariates. The results document that kinship tightness is negatively correlated with the relative importance of altruistic punishment within countries.

6.5

Institutions

To understand the relationship between the development of institutional structures and
kinship tightness, I consider variation across ethnicities in the EA. As outlined above,
this analysis requires me to distinguish between institutions at the local (community)
level and those that supersede separate groups, which I refer to as “global”. First, the
data contain a five-step variable that measures the number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchies beyond the local community (e.g., no levels, petty chiefdom, large chiefdom,
state, large state, Q33 in the EA). This is the standard variable in the literature that people have used to proxy for the institutional sophistication of ethnicities in the EA (e.g.,
Giuliano and Nunn, 2013). However, the data also contain a variable that measures the
levels of jurisdictional hierarchy at the local level (Q32), which is used less frequently
in the literature. Local levels of hierarchy include nuclear family, extended family, clan,

age, age squared, self-reported cognitive skills, and educational attainment fixed effects (three
categories). Country of origin controls include dependence on agriculture, number of levels of
jurisdictional hierarchies above the local level, and year of observation (all from the EA, but computed as pertaining to contemporary populations) as well as distance from the equator, log land

and village. These institutional structures are arguably not just more “local”, but also
more informal than the jurisdictional hierarchies above the local level.
Columns (1)–(4) of Table 11 relate these two variables to the kinship tightness index. As hypothesized, kinship tightness is negatively correlated with the development
of institutions above the local level, but positively associated with levels of hierarchy
at the local level, conditional on the society’s dependence on agriculture and animal
husbandry, respectively, settlement complexity, year of observation, distance from the
equator, longitude, average elevation, and continent fixed effects. These findings are
consistent with the idea that tight kinship coevolved with strong institutions at the
local level to regulate behavior within the group, while loose kinship requires the development of broader institutional frames to sustain cooperation across groups.
To shed further light on the nature of local institutions, I again make use of detailed ethnographic information from the SCCS and consider the power these local
institutions had in terms of spelling out sanctions and enforcement for community decisions²⁰ Columns (5) and (6) show that high kinship tightness is associated with local
institutions that were not just more developed, but also more powerful in enforcing
behavior. Here, the smaller number of observations only allows me to condition on a
subset of covariates, including continent fixed effects and geographic covariates.
²⁰For this purpose, I extract the first principal component of Q776 and Q777 in the SCCS. These items
code the power of local institutions in enforcing community decisions and the presence of enforcement
specialists, respectively, see Appendix C for details.

Figure 4: Relationship between kinship tightness and the relative importance of altruistic punishment in
the GPS (left panel) and the subjective importance of behaving properly in the WVS (right panel). Both
figures are partial correlation plots conditional on the vector of “EA controls”, compare, e.g., column (5)
of Table 4.

In sum, tight kinship is associated with less developed institutions above the local
level, but powerful institutions at the local level to regulate in-group behavior. A potential concern with these regressions is that they compare ethnicicities with different
subsistence modes. Chiefly, while some ethnic groups followed sophisticated farming
or herding practices, others subsisted largely on hunting, gathering, and fishing. The
analysis addresses this issue by controlling for (i) the extent (0-100%) to which an ethnicity subsisted on agriculture and animal husbandry, respectively, (ii) the complexity
of local settlements as proxy for local development, and (iii) the year of observation in
the EA. In a further robustness check, Table 17 in Appendix A shows that very similar
results hold if I exclude all hunter-gatherers from the sample.

6.6

Social Norms

Social norms can be thought of as informal institutions, i.e., a set of rules that regulates
behavior without elaborate formal enforcement structures. The study of norms can be
partitioned into people’s behavioral conformity to social norms, and their intrinsic values
related to norm adherence.²¹
The standard method to experimentally measure norm compliance in social psychology consists of Asch’s (1956) famous conformity game. Here, subjects are asked
to point out the longest line out of a set of three, and are implicitly induced to give
blatantly obvious wrong answers because seven other “subjects” (who are actually confederates) provided the same mistaken response beforehand. That is, these confeder²¹The cultural psychologist Gelfand et al. (2011) develops a survey-based measure of “tight” vs.
“loose” countries with respect to social norms. This country-level index exhibits a correlation of ρ = 0.31
with kinship tightness (p < 0.1).

dependent variables in columns (1)–(2) and (3)–(4) are the number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchy above the local and at the local level, respectively. In columns (5)–(6), the dependent variable
is the extent to which there is local enforcement and sanctioning for community decisions. The dependent variable in columns (7)–(8) is the average of the z-scores of four variables that measure the
extent to which societies instill obedience into young boys, old boys, young girls, and old girls, respectively. All dependent variables are expressed as z-scores. In columns (1)–(4), the historical controls
include dependence on agriculture, dependence on animal husbandry, year of observation, settlement
complexity, distance from the equator, longitude, and average elevation. Due to the smaller number

ates uniformly point to the same wrong line to make the subject feel like they “have to”
conform. Since the implementation of this seminal study, researchers have replicated
this design across 17 countries, as summarized in the meta-study of Bond and Smith
(1996). This meta-study contains a total of 133 studies. The measure of conformity is
the fraction of wrong responses in this experimental game, i.e., the fraction of subjects
who follow the confederates.
Second, to assess the extent to which people’s conformity with group norms is
driven by values related to norm adherence, the analysis makes use of a range of questions in the WVS and ESS that ask people to assess to which extent it is important to
“behave properly”, “follow the rules”, and “not draw attention”.
The analysis begins at the country level. Column (1) of Table 12 shows that kinship
tightness is strongly positively correlated (ρ = 0.69) with conformity in Asch’s game.
Columns (2)–(4) provide evidence that valuing proper behavior is also significantly
positively related to kinship tightness. The right panel of Figure 4 depicts the crosscountry relationship between kinship tightness and valuing proper behavior.
In a next step, the analysis provides within-country evidence for the relationship between social norm adherence and kinship tightness. For this purpose, I exploit variation
in values related to norm adherence in the WVS and ESS, see Table 13. Columns (1)–

Notes. Country-level OLS estimates, robust standard errors in parentheses. The dependent variable in column (1) is the fraction of errors in Asch’s conformity game, i.e., the fraction of subjects who follow the responses of the confederates. In columns (2)–(4), the dependent variable is the average importance respondents in the WVS

as z-scores. EA controls include dependence on agriculture, number
of levels of jurisdictional hierarchies above the local level, and year
of observation (all computed as pertaining to contemporary populations). Other controls include distance from the equator, log land
suitability for agriculture, and ancestry-adjusted log population density in 1500. ∗ p < 0.10, ∗∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗∗ p < 0.01.

(2) exploit variation across native ethnicities within countries in the WVS to show that
valuing proper behavior is positively related to kinship tightness. Similarly, columns
(3)–(8) exploit variation across second-generation migrants in the ESS to show that ancestral kinship tightness (of mother’s and father’s country of birth) are correlated with
valuing proper behavior, rule-following, and not drawing attention.²²
In a final step, the analysis investigates the importance of social norm adherence in
historical ethnicities. For this purpose, I again make use of detailed information in the
SCCS on the values that parents inculcated in their children, according to ethnographic
records. In particular, four separate variables describe the extent to which obedience
is instilled into young boys, old boys, young girls, and old girls, respectively, on a scale
of 0–9 each (Q322-325). I compute the z-scores of these four obedience variables and
then average them to arrive at a summary measure of obedience. Columns (7) and
(8) of Table 11 show that obedience is positively correlated with kinship tightness in
historical ethnicities. In sum, across contemporary countries, ethnicities, and migrants
as well as historical ethnicities, kinship tightness is positively related to the importance
²²Similar results hold when I use the importance of inculcating obedience into children from the WVS
in the within-country analyses.

sample consists of individuals in the WVS. The dependent variable is the importance people attach to behaving
properly. The standard errors are clustered at the ethnicity level. Individual level controls include gender, age, age

of jurisdictional hierarchies above the local level, distance from the equator, and year of observation in the EA. In
columns (3)–(8), the sample includes individuals in the ESS and the standard errors are clustered at the level of
the country of birth of the father times the country of birth of the mother. The dependent variables are the extent
to which respondents deem following rules, behaving properly, and not drawing attention important. Individual

of norm adherence.
Taken together, the analysis in this section has brought to light that the two extreme
poles of cooperation systems are associated with fundamentally different enforcement
schemes. On the one hand, the broad cooperation and trust patterns of loose kinship
societies are supported by large-scale institutions and “internal police officers” that
broadly sanction wrongdoing even outside of the in-group, including moralizing gods,
universal moral values, and guilt. On the other hand, the in-group oriented cooperation system of tight kinship societies appears to be sustained by strong social norms
and corresponding values of norm adherence, combined with strong local institutions,
tribalistic moral values, and an increased importance of being shamed in front of others. Thus, punishment in tight kinship societies is largely personal and direct, while it
is often anonymous and “psychological” in loose kinship societies.

Further Robustness Checks
Additional Covariates

The empirical analysis accounted for a number of geographic, climatic and historical
control variables. This section assesses the extent to which the contemporary crosscountry and migrant-level results are robust against the inclusion of further covariates.
Further geographic covariates.

Tables 19 and 20 in Appendix A replicate all cross-

country analyses (with a sufficiently large number of observations), but additionally
control for longitude, average elevation, average temperature and the fraction of the
population at risk of malaria. Tables 21 and 22 conduct analogous analyses by replicating the migrant-level analyses in the ESS and MFQ, respectively. All results are robust
to these additional covariates.
Fraction of the population of European descent. Second, Tables 23 and 24 in Appendix A replicate the cross-country analyses, but additionally control for the fraction
of the population of European descent, constructed from the migration matrix of Putterman and Weil (2010). This control variable is of particular interest because many
European ethnicities have relatively low kinship tightness. Still, the results remain almost unchanged when the fraction of Europeans is accounted for. Tables 25 and 26
conduct analogous analyses by replicating the migrant-level analyses in the ESS and
MFQ, respectively. Again, controlling for the fraction of Europeans in migrants’ country
of birth leaves the results unaffacted.
National income and human capital. Next, I control for national income per capita
and the average years of schooling in a given country. These variables are arguably
“bad controls” in the sense that the hypothesized coevolution of kinship structures and
cooperation systems that is at the heart of this paper might plausibly also affect these
proxies for comparative development. Still, Tables 26–32 in Appendix A show that a
large majority of both the cross-country and the within-country results reported above
hold up when controlling for income per capita or average years of schooling.

7.2

Separate Kinship Tightness Proxies

Thus far, the empirical analysis has relied on the summary statistic of kinship tightness
that was derived from six characteristics of ethnicities in the EA. While the idea behind
this index – that kinship is a multidimensional concept – is arguably very much in line

37

with how anthropologists think about these issues, it may be of interest to ask whether
any single of these six characteristics alone is strongly predictive of cooperation patterns and enforcement devices. To assess this, Tables 33–38 in Appendix A replicate
one specification for each dependent variable from the above analyses by using each
kinship tightness variable separately. The results are strongest for post-wedding residence patterns, the presence of lineages, and the presence of localized clans, yet all
of the kinshop tightness variables appear to have “explanatory” power for the different
outcome variables.

Tight Kinship, Agriculture and Development

Anthropologists have long argued that – correlationally – kinship tightness is humpshaped in economic development (see Blumberg and Winch, 1972, for an early account). In essence, their argument has two ingredients. First, they assert that tight
kinship ties optimally evolved when societies transitioned from hunter-gatherer subsistence to agricultural production. According to these accounts, agricultural subsistence lead to the emergence of tight kinship systems because (i) agriculture implies
an enhanced need for small-scale cooperation for the sake of planting or harvesting
crop under time pressure, or controlling and defending territory to protect fields in the
timeframe between harvesting and planting, that can be achieved in extended families
(Johnson and Earle, 2000; Talhelm et al., 2014; Gowdy and Krall, 2016), (ii) sedentary
agriculture often implies de facto moving restrictions because farmers’ wealth is “tied
to the soil”, implying that people are less likely to mingle with geographically distant
groups and thereby weaken local kinship structures (Fei et al., 1992), and (iii) agricultural subsistence often comes with increased pathogen prevalence, against which one
mode of protection is to reduce out-group interaction (Fincher et al., 2008; Fincher
and Thornhill, 2012). In line with these hypotheses, recent small-scale anthropological
evidence suggests that farming societies are indeed especially prone to marry within
clan (Walker, 2014). In contrast, hunter-gatherers predominantly have large social networks and reside with genetically unrelated individuals (Hill et al., 2011).
Second, in contrast to the hypothesized positive association between kinship tightness and development at very early stages in the development process, anthropologists
hold that tight kinship might have been detrimental in the transition from simple agricultural to more advanced production modes. The argument is that tight kinship prevents people from cooperating and interacting broadly, trusting strangers, participating
in specialization and trade, and being geographically mobile, all of which are activities
that increasigly paid off after the Industrial Revolution took place (e.g., Henrich, n.d.).

Figure 5: The left panel depicts average kinship tightness and corresponding standard errors for each
of six levels of agricultural intensity. The right panel visualizes the partial correlation between kinship
tightness and per capita income conditional on the vector of “EA controls”, compare, e.g., column (5) of
Table 4.

This paper investigates these theories on a correlational basis. The left panel of
Figure 5 presents a histogram of average kinship tightness across six categories of agricultural intensity of societies in the EA. According to this classification, agricultural
practices vary from no agriculture, to casual, to extensive, and eventually to intensive
and intensive irrigated agriculture. Here, intensive agriculture should be thought of
as technologically more advanced production techniques including fertilization, crop
rotation, or other techniques to shorten or eliminate fallow periods.
The histogram reveals that kinship tightness indeed significantly increases by almost 30% as the subsistence mode changes from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle (first two
categories) to extensive agriculture. However, as the agricultural production technology becomes more advanced, kinship tightness decreases again, which is reminiscent
of the “curvilinear hypothesis” in anthropology (Blumberg and Winch, 1972). Table 41
in Appendix A analyzes this pattern more rigorously through OLS regressions and confirms that the relationship between kinship tightness and agricultural intensity is indeed
hump-shaped. At the same time, the variance explained in these regressions is fairly
small (10%). In other words, while there appears to be systematic covariation of kinship
tightness and agricultural production modes, the data exhibit large heterogeneity on
top of this mechanism. For example, the large difference in kinship structures between
Western Europe and large parts of Asia cannot be “explained” by agricultural intensity:
after all, many East and Southeast Asian ethnicities employed advanced intensive irrigated production modes that – according to the classification in the EA – are at least as
advanced as the subsistence style of early Western Europeans.
In any case, the data presented in this section evidently do not lend themselves to
a straightforward (causal) interpretation: even if it was true that agricultural subsis-

39

tence caused the emergence of tight kinship structures, it is not obvious whether the
decreasing part of the relationship between kinship tightness and agricultural intensity
reflects the causal negative effect of kinship tightness on technological progress, or, e.g.,
a by-product of more general social change (e.g., Greenfield, 2009, 2013).
Given that contemporary societies consist of few hunter-gatherer groups, the anthropological theory of a hump-shaped relationship between development and kinship
tightness predicts that contemporary income and kinship tightness are negatively correlated. The right panel of Figure 5 shows that this is indeed the case, ρ = −0.53.²³
However, this strong negative correlation appears to have emerged relatively recently.
To make this point, I regress country-level log population density (as adequate proxy for
development in pre-industrial times) in any given available year since 1000 CE on kinship tightness and then analyze the evolution of OLS coefficients over time. To keep the
analysis meaningful in light of the changes in the structure of populations in the course
of the post-Columbian migration flows, I restrict the sample to those 127 countries in
which at least 50% of the current population are native, according to the migration
matrix of Putterman and Weil (2010). The left panel of Figure 6 presents the results.
In this figure, each dot represents the regression coefficient of kinship tightness from a
given year and the color coding is used to denote statistical significance.²⁴
As the figure shows, the relationship between country-level population density and
kinship tightness starts out to be small and statistically insignificant. However, around
the onset of the Industrial Revolution, the coefficient rapidly increases in absolute size
and becomes statistically significant. Moreover, a set of Seemingly Unrelated Regressions brings to light that the regression coefficient in 1900 is statistically significantly
larger than those in, e.g., 1000, 1500, 1600, 1700, and 1800 (p < 0.01).
The right panel of Figure 6 replicates the preceeding analysis, but uses urbanization
rates instead of population density as dependent variable. The resulting picture is very
similar in that the relationship between kinship tightness and development becomes
much stronger in the course of the Industrial Revolution.

²³Table 40 in Appendix A investigates this correlation more thorougly through multiple regression
analysis and shows that the correlation is robust to the standard control variables that are commonly
used in the literature. While the hump-shaped relationship between kinship tightness and agricultural
intensity is statistically significant and in line with prior anthropological work, it should be emphasized
that this relationship per se does not account for the contemporary cross-country correlation between per
capita income and ancestral kinship tightness. For example, in an OLS regression of per capita income
on kinship tightness and ancestral agricultural intensity, the former is statistically highly significant,
compare Table 40 in Appendix A.

except that the dependent variables are urbanization rates.

Conclusion

Based on prominent narratives in cultural psychology and anthropology, this paper has
presented an analysis of cultural variation in cooperation patterns and corresponding
enforcement devices. The results suggest that social organization matters: it is intimately linked to the way people cooperate with and trust each other, and the formal
and informal mechanisms they put in place to enforce cooperation.
The key insight of the analysis is that – in line with prominant accounts in psychology and anthropology (Greene, 2014; Henrich, 2015, n.d.) – basic aspects of human
psychology and biology including the structure of religious beliefs, moral values, social
preferences, and basic emotions, seem to have adapted to serve the functional role of
enforcing cooperation within specific social structures. Indeed, the results suggest that
maintaining cooperation in society necessitates the coevolution of an entire bundle of
tools including institutions, psychology, and biology. These results shed light on two
prominent puzzles in cross-cultural research.
First, the results provide a rationale why we observe such a large cultural variation in such dimensions: because some cultural traits regulate different cooperation
regimes, they necessarily differ across societies. Second, the analysis illuminates the
co-occurrence of various cultural traits. Across the social sciences, researchers with an
interest in cultural variation have noted that cultural traits are frequently highly correlated, yet insights into why that is the case are rare (Alesina and Giuliano, 2015). The
present paper sheds light on this issue by showing that different cultural traits serve a

41

similar role in enforcing cooperation within a given regime, so that their co-occurrence
is simply a by-product of them disciplining prosocialbehavior in similar ways.
A key open question concerns the origins of the large heterogeneity in ancestral
kinship systems. The analysis has taken a first step in this direction by discussing the
relationship between agricultural subsistence and kinship ties, yet – as discussed in
Section 8 – this does not explain, e.g., the stark difference between Western Europe
and many other parts of the world. Historians and anthropologists have put forward
a number of potential proximate mechanisms through which European local kinship
structures got dismantled (most prominenently the Roman Catholic Church, Goody,
1983; Henrich, n.d.; Schulz, 2016), yet what ultimately set these social changes in
motion is beyond our current understanding.

Notes. Country-level OLS estimates, robust standard errors in parentheses. In columns (7)–(9), the standard
errors are clustered at the dominant language in a country. The dependent variable in columns (1)–(3) is the
individualism variable of Hofstede (1984). In columns (4)–(6), it is family ties as discussed in Alesina and Giuliano (2013), and in columns (7)–(9) it is the fraction of the population that speaks a language which allows
dropping the pronoun, see Appendix C. EA controls include dependence on agriculture, number of levels of
jurisdictional hierarchies above the local level, and year of observation (all computed as pertaining to contemporary populations). Other controls include distance from the equator, log land suitability for agriculture, and
ancestry-adjusted log population density in 1500. ∗ p < 0.10, ∗∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗∗ p < 0.01.

Notes. Country-level WLS estimates, robust standard errors in parentheses. The
dependent variable in columns (1)–(3) is the in-group loyalty dimension in the
MFQ. In columns (4)–(6), I compute the relative importance of universally applicable values by adding the MFQ dimensions of fairness / reciprocity and harm
/ care and subtracting in-group loyalty and submission to authority. The sample
includes all countries, and each observation is weighted by the square root of the
number of respondents in the MFQ. EA controls include dependence on agriculture, number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchies above the local level, and year
of observation (all computed as pertaining to contemporary populations). Other
controls include distance from the equator, log land suitability for agriculture,

Notes. Country-level OLS estimates, robust standard errors in parentheses. In columns (1)–(2), the dependent variable is the fraction of jobs that is assigned
based on kinship (Van de Vliert, 2011). In columns (3)–(4), it is general trust and in (5)–(6), the difference between in- and out-group trust, see Table 2.
In columns (7)–(8) and (9)–(10), the dependent variables are in-group loyalty and the relative importance of tribalistic moral values in the MFQ, compare
Table 7. All dependent variables are expressed as z-scores. EA controls include dependence on agriculture, number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchies above
the local level, and year of observation (all computed as pertaining to contemporary populations). Other controls include distance from the equator, log land
suitability for agriculture, and ancestry-adjusted log population density in 1500. Additional geography include longitude, average temperature, average
elevation, and the fraction of the population at risk of malaria. ∗ p < 0.10, ∗∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗∗ p < 0.01.

C.1.1

Ethnographic Atlas
Construction of Kinship Tightness Index

Extended vs. nuclear family.

Q8. Binary variable that takes on value of zero if do-

mestic organization is around nuclear families (1 and 2), and one otherwise.
Post-wedding residence. Q11. Binary variable coded as 1 if couples can live with
either the husband’s or the wife’s family or have neolocal residence (3) or no common
residence (8), and zero otherwise.
Kin terminology. Q27. Binary variable coded as zero if the kin terminology (q27) is
“Eskimo’ (3) or “Hawaiian’ (4), and one otherwise.
Cousin marriage. Q24. Three-step variable that takes on value of zero if no first or
second cousins can be married (8), 0.5 if second cousins can be married (5-7), and one
otherwise. Whenever Q24 is missing, the cousin marriage variable is imputed from the
kin terminology variable. For this purpose, I first compute the average cousin marriage
variable for each of the eight possible values of Q27, and then assign this average value
to an ethnicity based on its kin terminology if Q24 is missing.
Polgamy.

Q9. Binary variable that takes on value of zero if monogamous (1) and zero

otherwise.
Lineages. Q43. Binary variable that takes on the value zero if descent is bilateral and
one otherwise.
Segmented communities and localized clans.

Q15. Binary variable that takes value

of one in the presence of segmented communities or localized clans (2, 5 and 6) and
zero otherwise.
Kinship tightness. First principal component of extended vs. nuclear family, postwedding residence, cousin marriage, polygamy, lineages, and segmented communities
and clans.

Q34. Binary variable coded as one if a High Gods is present and

supportive of human morality, and zero otherwise.
Number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchy above local level. Q33. Five-step categorical variable that describes the number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchies above
the local level (0-4 levels).
Number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchy at local level.

Q32. Three-step cate-

gorical variable that describes the number of levels of jurisdictional hierarchies at the
local level (2-4 levels).

Q5. Ranges from 2.5% to 92.5% by taking midpoint of

respective interval.
Dependence on animal husbandry. Q4. Ranges from 2.5% to 92.5% by taking midpoint of respective interval.
Agricultural intensity. Q28. Categorical variable that characterizes the intensity of
agriculture production modes, ranging from 1 to 6. The categories are: 1 for no agriculture, 2 for casual agriculture, incidental to other subsistence modes, 3 for extensive or
shifting agriculture, long fallow, and new fields cleared annually, 4 for horticulture, vegetal gardens or groves of fruit trees, 5 for intensive agriculture, using fertilization, crop
rotation, or other techniques to shorten or eliminate fallow period, and 6 for intensive
irrigated agriculture.
Year of observation.

Q101 and Q102. Year of observation in EA.

Settlement complexity.

Q30. Eight-step categorical variable that describes settlement

patterns as: 1 for nomadic or fully migratory, 2 for seminomadic, 3 for semisedentary,
4 for compact but impermanent settlements, 5 for neighborhoods of dispersed geamily
homesteads, 6 for separated hamlets that form a single community, 7 for compact and
relatively permanent settlements, and 8 for complex settlements.
Distance from equator, longitude.

Q103, Q104.

C.2

Standard Cross-Cultural Sample

Trust in children. Q335. Describes the extent to which societies inculcate trust in
their children. Categorical variable ranging from 0 to 9, with 0 representing “no inculcation or opposite trait” and 9 “extremely strong inculcation”.
Obedience in children. Q322-Q325. Describes the extent to which societies inculcate
obedience into young boys, old boys, young girls, and old girls, respectively. Categorical variables ranging from 0 to 9, with 0 representing “no inculcation or opposite trait”
and 9 “extremely strong inculcation”. The final score of obedience is computed as unweighted average of the z-scores of the four separate obedience variables.
Loyalty to community. Describes the extent to which members of society feel loyal
to their local community. Categorical variable ranging from 0 to 3 (“especially high”,
“high”, “moderate”, and “low”).
Strength of local enforcement.

Q776 and Q777. Q776 describes the extent to which

societies made use of formal sanctions and enforcement for community decisions (2:
“great sanctioning power available”, 1: “some”, 0: “little or none”). Q777 encodes the
presence of enforcement specialists (1: “present” or “not specialized but done by leaders
who do other things as well”, 0: “absent, or carried out by social pressure of wider community”). The final score of strength of local enforcement is computed as first principal
component of these two variables.

C.3.1

Cross-Country Data
Construction of Country-Level Kinship Tightness Index

Giuliano and Nunn (2017) develop a method to match ancestral ethnicity-level characteristics in the EA to contemporary populations. They do so by matching each of 7,000
contemporary language groups in the 16th edition of the Ethnologue manually to one
of the ethnicities in the EA (through the language spoken by the historical ethnicities).
The Ethnologue maps the current geographic distribution of languages, so that after
matching historical ethnicities to language groups, average ancestral traits based on
the EA can be computed at various different levels of aggregation. The analysis in this
80

paper only relies on a country-level summary statistic. Thus, the country-level kinship
tightness indexis computed by first constructing kinship tightness at the ethnicity level
as described above, and then applying Giuliano and Nunn’s 2017 matching procedure.

General trust.

Answers to WVS question: do you agree that most people can be

trusted (A165). Country level results calculated as means of all individual level responses across waves.
Out-group trust.

Based on answers to three WVS questions on how much one trusts

people that one meets for the first time (G007_34), people of another nationality
(G007_01) and people of another religion (G007_35). Country level variable constructed
as average across individuals and waves, averaged across the three different trust variables.

In-group trust

Based on answers to three WVS questions on how much one trusts

one’s family (D001), neighbors (G007_18) and people known personally (G007_33).
Country level variable constructed as average across individuals and waves, averaged
across the three different trust variables.
Trust [In-group – Out-group].

Difference between in-group and out-group trust.

Google searches for shame and guilt.

First, I restricted the set of languages to

those that are an official language in at least two countries (since otherwise no withinlanguage variation can be exploited) and that are included in Jaffe et al. (2014) so I
have access to the most apt translations for shame and guilt. This is the case for English, Arabic, French, German, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Persian, and Slovakian.
Second, for each remaining language, access the relative search frequency of “shame”
and “guilt”, respectively, on Google Trends, restricting attention to countries in which
the respective language is an official language. Note that this procedure implies that
those countries with multiple official languages appear multiple times in the resulting
dataset. Second, rescale the Google Trends output such that the maximum in the consideration set of countries is always 100 (Google Trends sclaes their data to be between 0
and 100. I need to adjust these data in cases in which the maximum of 100 is a country
outside of the consideration set, e.g., a country in which the respective language is not
an official language.) Finally, for each country-language-pair, compute the difference
between the search frequency index for shame and guilt.
ISEAR self-reports of shame and guilt. The ISEAR is a multi-national psychological
study led by Klaus Scherer and Harald Wallbott. In 36 countries, researchers distributed
questionnaires among university students. These questionnaires contained questions on
seven emotions (joy, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, shame, and guilt). Respondents were
first asked to describe a situation in which they experienced an emotion. Then, for each
emotion, they were asked to describe how long-lasting (1=minutes, 2=an hour, 3=several hours, 4=a day or more) and how intense (1=not very, 2=moderately, 3=intense,
4=very) the feeling was. For each of these categories, I compute the difference between shame and guilt, and then average these two differences to arrive at a summary
statistic of the relative strength of shame. For details and data access see http://www.
affective-sciences.org/en/home/research/materials-and-online-research/
research-material/.

Altruistic punishment in PGG. Relative prevalence of altruistic over antisocial punishment in the public goods game of Herrmann et al. (2008). This variable is com82

puted based on the data presented in Figure 1 in Herrmann et al. (2008). Specifically,
I compute average altruistic punishment as average punishment in cases in which the
punisher contributed weakly more than the punished participant. Average antisocial
punishment is analogously computed as average punishment in cases in which the punisher contributed strictly more than the punished subject. The dependent variable of
interest is then the difference between altruistic and antisocial punishment.
Altruistic punishment in GPS.

Relative prevalence of altruistic over second-party

punishment, based on data in the GPS Falk et al. (2016). To construct this variable, I
first combine two survey items that were intended to measure second-party punishment.
These questions asked respondents to assess themselves regarding the statement “If I
am treated very unjustly, I will take revenge at the first occasion, even if there is a
cost to do so.” and to indicate “How willing are you to punish someone who treats
you unfairly, even if there may be costs for you?”. I aggregate these two variables by
computing the average of their z-scores. Altruistic punishment, on the other hand, is
the z-score of responses to the question “How willing are you to punish someone who
treats others unfairly, even if there may be costs for you?”. The dependent variable is
then the difference between the measures of altruistic and second-party punishment.
Tightness of social norms.

Index measuring the strength of social norms developed

by Uz (2015). The index computes the standard deviation in responses for various
morally disputable behaviors in the WVS. The underlying reasoning is that the presence
of strong social norms should induce people to give similar responses, irrespective of
what that response may be. Data taken rom Uz (2015).
Conformity.

Measure of conformity based on a meta-analysis of Asch’s conformity

game by Bond and Smith (1996) that covers 133 studies across 17 countries. The variable is the average fraction of errors people make in the conformity game, i.e., the
fraction of times respondents give the same (wrong) response as the experimental confederates, across experimental studies within a given country.
Importance of behaving properly. Based on answers to WVS question: It is important to this person to always behave properly (A196). Aggregate to country level based
on country where the interview was conducted.
In-group loyalty.

Based on data in the online version of the Moral Foundations Ques-

tionnaire, www.yourmorals.org. The in-group loyalty index is based on answers to
six questions. First, people are asked to assess to which extent the following behaviors
83

are morally relevant: Whether or not someone cared for someone weak or vulnerable
(q3), Whether or not someone did something to betray his or her group (q9), Whether
or not someone did something disgusting (q14). Second, respondents are asked to indicate their agreement or disagreement with the following statements: It is more important to be a team player than to express oneself (q19), I am proud of my countryś
history (q25) and People should be loyal to their family members, even when they
have done something wrong (q30). All of these questions have response options between zero and five. The in-group loyalty score is then computed as sum of responses
across the six questions. The country score is obtained as average in-group loyalty of
all respondents in the MFQ in a given country of residence.
Relative importance of tribalistic moral values. Based on data in the online version
of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire, www.yourmorals.org. This composite index
measures the relative importance of the moral dimensions of “fairness / reciprocity”
and “harm / care” (which constitute universally applicable moral principles) over “ingroup / loyalty” and “authority / respect”, which are relationship-specific obligations,
i.e., “groupish” or “tribalistic” values. The full Moral Foundations Questionnaire can be
accessed here: http://www.moralfoundations.org/questionnaires. The score
of the relative importance of universal moral values is computed through the following
procedure: First, at the individual level, normalize each moral foundation by dividing
it through the sum of all four dimensions to express the importance of values relative
to each other rather than in absolute terms. Second, conduct a principal component
analysis. Here, the resulting weights in the index of the relative importance of universal
moral values are -0.60 for harm / care, -0.33 for fairness / reciprocity, 0.53 for ingroup
/ loyalty and 0.50 for authority / respect. Finally, compute the average of this index by
country of residence.
Individualism.

Variable generated by Hofstede (1984) and taken from https://

geert-hofstede.com/countries.html. The data are available at the country level

and are based on qualitative questionnaires conducted with IBM employees. According
to Hofstede, this measure is meant to capture the following: “The high side of this dimension, called individualism, can be defined as a preference for a loosely-knit social
framework in which individuals are expected to take care of only themselves and their
immediate families. Its opposite, collectivism, represents a preference for a tightly-knit
framework in society in which individuals can expect their relatives or members of a
particular in-group to look after them in exchange for unquestioning loyalty. A society’s position on this dimension is reflected in whether people’s self-image is defined in
terms of “I” or “we”.”
84

Family ties. Following Alesina and Giuliano (2013), defined as first principal component of answers to three World Value Survey questions: how important is family in life
(A001), one should respect and love parents (A025) and parents have responsibilities
towards their children (A026). Larger values correspond to stronger agreement to the
statement. Country level results calculated as means of all individual level responses
across waves.
Pronoun drop. Following Tabellini (2008a), this variable measures whether a given
language allows to drop the pronoun. The argument is that languages that forbid dropping the first-person pronoun give more emphasis to the individual as opposed to the
group. The score is computed by applying the classification in the World Atlas of Languages, supplemented by Kashima and Kashima (1998). To arrive at a country-level
score, I compute a weighted average across languages, weighted by the fraction of
speakers according to Ethnologue. The analysis is restricted to countries in which I
could classify at least 75% of the population.
