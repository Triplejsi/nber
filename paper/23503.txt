Trade Induced Structural Change and the Skill Premium

JEL No. F16,F62,F63
ABSTRACT
We study how international trade affects manufacturing employment and the relative wage of
unskilled workers when goods and services are traded with different intensities. Manufacturing
trade reduces manufacturing prices worldwide, which reduces manufacturing employment if
manufactures and services are complements. We document that manufacturing production is
unskilled-labor intensive, so that these changes increase the skill-premium. We incorporate this
mechanism in a quantitative trade model and show that trade has had a negative impact on
manufacturing employment and the relative wage of unskilled workers. The impact on the skill
premium was larger in developing countries where manufacturing is particularly unskilled-labor
intensive.

Introduction

What is the impact of international trade on manufacturing employment and wage inequality? Policy makers in developed countries are increasingly concerned that competition from poor countries may be shifting manufacturing jobs overseas and hurting unskilled workers. These concerns are in line with the predictions of the standard HeckscherOhlin model, which indicates that, as countries open up to trade, sectors where a country
has a comparative advantage will expand at the expense of other sectors, while the skill
premium will rise in skilled-labor abundant countries and fall in other countries.1 Manufacturing employment, however, has been falling both in countries that are net-importers
and net-exporters of manufactured goods. Moreover, as noted by Goldberg and Pavcnik
(2007), the model’s predictions for the skill premium appear to be at odds with the trade
liberalization experiences of developing, unskilled-labor abundant countries.
This paper evaluates an alternative mechanism through which international trade can
reduce the relative size of the manufacturing sector and the relative wage of unskilled
workers simultaneously in all countries. Rapid growth in manufacturing trade lowers
the relative price of manufactured goods worldwide, and, if manufacturing and services
are complements, it also reduces the share of manufactured goods in total value added
and in total employment.2 If the production of manufacturing goods is unskilled-labor intensive, increasing manufacturing trade can then raise the skill premium in all countries.
We incorporate this mechanism in a quantitative trade model and measure how changes
in trade patterns affected manufacturing employment and the skill premium across countries between 1995 and 2007.
We first document three features of the data that are key for determining the direction and strength of this mechanism. First, we show that for a broad set of countries,
the pace of trade integration between 1995 and 2007 has been quite uneven across goodsproducing (manufacturing, agriculture and mining) and service sectors. While growth
in services trade has outpaced growth in goods trade, the share of domestically produced services in total absorption of services has remained roughly constant, whereas
the share of domestically produced goods in total absorption of goods has declined dramatically. Second, we document large differences in skill intensities across broad sectors: goods-producing sectors are unskilled-labor intensive, as are some service sectors
1 See

Leamer and Levinsohn (1995) for a survey of the early Heckscher-Ohlin literature, and Goldberg
and Pavcnik (2007) for a review of the more recent literature.
2 The effect of relative price changes on the sectoral composition of the economy was first studied by
Baumol (1967). Growth in manufacturing trade is akin to growth in manufacturing productivity, as it
allows countries to specialize in the production of manufactured goods in which they have a comparative
advantage.

(such as construction and retail), while other service sectors (such as FIRE and health)
are skilled-labor intensive. Third, we show that relative to skilled-labor intensive sectors, unskilled-labor intensive sectors (both goods and services) use more intermediate
inputs from goods-producing sectors. The first two observations imply that, if goods
and services are complements, the changes in trade patterns between 1995 and 2007 were
skill-biased, as they induced reallocation of employment out of unskilled-labor intensive
goods and into skilled-labor intensive services (i.e. they induced structural change). The
third observation implies that the effect of a decline in the relative price of goods is magnified by the intensive use of goods as intermediate inputs in unskilled-labor intensive
sectors.
We quantify the importance of these mechanisms using a multi-country, multi-sector
model of trade. In the model, trade patterns shape the allocation of workers across sectors
that are traded with different intensities and that employ skilled and unskilled workers
in different proportions. Our model extends that of Eaton and Kortum (2002) by allowing
for a non-unitary elasticity of substitution across sectors and for aggregate imbalances,
in a context of heterogeneity in workers’ skills. When the elasticity of substitution across
sectors is less than one, the goods sector shrinks following a decline in the share of domestically produced goods in absorption, as this lowers the relative price of goods. In
the model as in the data, goods-producing sectors are unskilled-labor intensive, so that
a decline in employment in these sectors increases the skill premium. In addition, as the
relative price of goods declines, so does the relative price of unskilled-labor intensive sectors that use intermediate goods inputs intensively, magnifying the effects of trade on the
skill premium. Finally, as in the standard Heckscher-Ohlin model, an increase in net imports in unskilled-labor intensive sectors also increases the skill premium. We highlight
that, while the Heckscher-Ohlin mechanism affects the skill premium through sectoral
differences in comparative advantage, trade also affects the skill premium in our model
through differences in the extent to which goods and services are traded.
We show that, as in Eaton and Kortum (2002), sectoral domestic expenditure shares
are sufficient statistics for how changes in trade costs, foreign technologies, and foreign
factor supplies affect relative prices in our model. The other key statistics needed for determining the impact of trade in the skill premium are sectoral net exports in skilled- and
unskilled-labor intensive sectors. We build on these results to write changes in sectoral
value added shares, employment shares, and the skill premium as functions of changes in
sectoral domestic expenditure shares, the ratio of net exports in each sector to economywide revenues, domestic productivities, and domestic labor endowments. We show that
the key elasticities that determine the strength of our mechanisms are: (i) the elasticity
2

of substitution across sectors, (ii) the elasticity of substitution across workers, and (iii)
the trade elasticity in each sector. We follow Herrendorf, Rogerson and Valentinyi (2013)
and estimate the elasticity of substitution across sectors from changes in relative prices
and relative expenditures using time series data for the US. We take the remaining key
elasticities (ii) and (iii) from the labor and the trade literature respectively.
We use the calibrated model to conduct two counterfactuals to evaluate the quantitative importance of the mechanisms described above. In the first counterfactual we estimate changes in trade costs between 1995 and 2007 and evaluate how these changes affect
employment in the goods sector and the skill premium across countries in our model.3
We show that, as in the data, the goods sector shrinks in most countries in this counterfactual. The employment share of the goods sector declines by about 8 percent in the
average country and by 12 percent in the US, relative to 21 and 25 percent in the data.
More importantly, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the slope of a regression between changes in sectoral employment shares in the data and those in the counterfactual
is equal to one, and the same is true when we consider changes in value-added shares.
Thus, while the counterfactual misses part of the global decline in the size of the goods
sector, the reduction in trade costs substantially contributes to understanding how this
decline has differed across countries. The skill premium in this counterfactual increases
in almost every country in our sample, by an average of 2.3 percent. Notably, the counterfactual change in the skill premium is larger in developing countries where the goods sector is particularly unskilled labor intensive, such as Turkey, Romania, Portugal or Poland.
Finally, we provide evidence for the mechanisms in the model by decomposing changes
in the share of skilled workers in employment into within-sector skill upgrading and
between-sector labor reallocation, and show that the reduction in trade costs is important
for understanding how the contribution of each component varies across countries.
The counterfactual described above isolates the effect of changes in trade costs on
wages and sectoral employment, and purposely abstracts from other international forces
that may affect these variables, such as productivity growth in foreign countries. A limitation of the exercise is that it requires bilateral trade data to be available simultaneously
for every country, and this is only available starting in 1995.4 This is unfortunate, as
much of the changes in the skill premium in some developed countries, such as the US,
took place during the 1980’s. In our second quantitative exercise, we take a sufficient
statistic approach to conduct counterfactuals country by country (so that we only need
3 In

particular, we estimate changes in trade costs over this period following Head and Ries (2001)
and use the “hat-algebra” approach developed in Dekle, Eaton and Kortum (2008) to evaluate how these
changes in trade costs affect the equilibrium of our model.
4 The main constraint is that service trade data for some of our countries is only available starting in 1995.

data for one country at a time), without having to take a stand on the underlying changes
in primitives driving the observed changes in trade patterns. In particular, we change a
country’s domestic expenditure shares and sectorial net exports from their observed levels in 1995, or an earlier year for countries where data are available, to those observed in
2007, while keeping domestic technologies and factor endowments fixed. This counterfactual measures, to a first-order approximation, how a country’s sectoral employment
shares and skill premium respond to all changes in technologies, endowments, and trade
costs over this period, relative to the response to these same changes, had that country
been in autarky.5 We show that in the US, in response to the observed changes in trade
patterns over the 1977-2007 period, the counterfactual generates a 20 percent decline in
the employment share of the goods sectors, relative to the 45 percent decline observed in
the data. These changes in turn affect the skill premium, which increases by 3.2 percent
in the US between 1977 and 2007 and by 3.8 percent in the average country of our sample
between 1995 and 2007.
We repeat this last exercise under three alternative calibrations to assess the importance of the features of the data highlighted above for our results. First, we re-calibrate
the model under the assumption that there are no intermediate inputs in production. We
show that while the qualitative results remain, the changes in sectoral employment shares
and the skill premium are only half as large as in our baseline calibration. Second, we calibrate a two-sector model that does not take into account the substantial heterogeneity in
skill and input intensities that we observe across service sectors. We show that, while the
counterfactual decline in the share of the goods producing sector is roughly the same as in
the baseline three-sector model, the counterfactual increase of the skill premium is about
27 percent smaller on average. Our last alternative calibration extends our baseline model
to allow for non-homothetic preferences using the generalized CES aggregator proposed
by Comin, Lashkari and Mestieri (2015), and shows that the counterfactual changes in the
skill premium are almost identical in the homothetic and the non-homothetic models.6
Finally, we use our model to re-evaluate measures of the effects of trade on the skill
premium that are based on the factor content of trade (FCT). The FCT measures the quantity of a factor of production that is embodied in a country’s net exports. Intuitively, an
increase in the trade-adjusted supply of a factor should decrease the factor’s price. We
use data generated by our model to show that FCT based measures of the skill premium
5A

similar interpretation to this type of counterfactual was first given by Burstein, Cravino and Vogel
(2013) and Burstein, Morales and Vogel (2015).
6 Intuitively, this follows from the fact that the real income gains from trade in our model are relatively
small (as is typically the case in the gravity models covered by Arkolakis, Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare
(2012)).

can greatly underestimate the effects of trade on the skill premium.7 In our context, trade
in goods increases the skill premium even if the factors embodied in a country’s exports
are the same as those embodied in a country’s imports.
Our paper is related to two strands of the literature. The first is the literature that uses
multi-country quantitative general equilibrium models to assess the importance of different channels through which trade affects the skill premium globally. Recent examples of
this literature are Parro (2013) and Burstein, Cravino and Vogel (2013), who measure the
effects of capital imports when the production function exhibits capital-skill complementarity, and Burstein and Vogel (2016), who study within-sector factor reallocation across
firms with different skill intensities.8 Our contribution to this literature is to propose and
quantify a novel mechanism through which trade can affect the skill premium: by inducing reallocation of labor across sectors that are traded with different intensities. To
provide a transparent quantification of this new channel, we abstract from other forces
already discussed in the literature.
Our work is also related to the recent literature that studies structural change in open
economies. Matsuyama (2009) shows that the growth of manufacturing productivity and
the relative size of the manufacturing sector can be decoupled in open economies. Uy,
Yi and Zhang (2013) use a two-country growth model featuring a Baumol effect and nonhomothetic preferences to study structural change in South Korea, while abstracting from
aggregate trade imbalances. Fajgelbaum and Redding (2014) study how changes in trade
costs affected structural change and spatial patterns of specialization in Argentina at the
end of the 19th century. Kehoe, Ruhl and Steinberg (2013) build a model of the US and
the rest of the world to assess the quantitative impact of U.S. borrowing on goods-sector
employment, in a context in which trade costs are fixed. Our contribution to this literature is to study how trade affects the skill premium through structural change, using a
parsimonious model that allows us to incorporate both trade imbalances and trade costs
reductions simultaneously in a setting with arbitrarily many countries.
Finally, Buera, Kaboski and Rogerson (2015) document that increases in GDP per
capita are associated with a shift in the composition of value added towards service sec7 Katz

and Murphy (1992) argue that the effects of international trade on the US skill premium are small
according to FCT measures. Burstein and Vogel (2016) point out that, if exporters and domestic producers
use different technologies, measures based on sector-level data underestimate the FCT. We show that in our
context the FCT severely understates the effect of trade on the skill premium even when perfectly measured.
8 In other related work, Matsuyama (2007) argues that trade can increase the skill premium if the factor
intensities for supplying a good depend on where the good is sold. Basco and Mestieri (2013) study how
asymmetric globalization patterns across sectors affect wage inequality in a North-South economy. Caron,
Fally and Markusen (2014) note that differences in skill intensities across goods with different income elasticities coupled with differences in skill endowments across countries can account for the excessive trade
among rich countries.

tors that are intensive in skilled labor. They find that these compositional changes account for roughly a quarter of the increase in the skill premium due to technical change.
Relative to Buera, Kaboski and Rogerson (2015), we document that, compared to serviceproducing sectors, goods-producing sectors experienced faster trade opening in the past
decades. In our multi-country setup, this makes international trade an additional driver
of the observed reallocation of labor out of unskilled labor intensive sectors and the increase in the skill premium. We also highlight the role of differences in input intensities
across sectors in magnifying the effects of changes in the price of goods on the skill premium.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reports differences in trade
patterns and in skill and input intensities across sectors for a panel of countries. Section
3 introduces our quantitative model and characterizes how trade and net exports shape
sectoral revenue shares and the skill premium in our framework. Section 4 shows how we
parameterize the model. Section 5 presents our quantitative results, and the last section
concludes.

Sectoral trade patterns and factor and input intensities

This section documents, for a wide set of countries, three differences across broad sectors that determine the effect of recent changes in trade patterns on real wages and the
skill premium. First, we show that the share of expenditures on domestically produced
goods relative to total absorption of goods declined dramatically between 1995 and 2007,
while the share of expenditures on domestically produced services relative to total absorption of services remained roughly constant. Second, we show that goods sectors
are unskilled-labor intensive. Finally, we show that unskilled-labor intensive sectors use
more intermediate inputs from goods-producing sectors.

2.1

Sectoral changes in trade patterns

We start by documenting differences in trade patterns across goods sectors and service
sectors. Figure 1 uses data from the World Input Output Database (WIOD) to plot imports of goods and services between 1995 and 2007.9 Both panels in the figure show the
dramatic increase in trade relative to GDP over this period. They also show that imports
9 We

classify Agriculture, Mining, and Manufacturing industries as goods-producing sectors, and the
remaining industries as services. We provide a detailed account of how we group industries in WIOD into
goods and services in Section 4 and in the data Appendix.

of services have grown slightly faster than imports of goods. For the US, the ratio of
service imports to GDP grew about 49 percent, while the ratio of goods imports to GDP
only by about 35 percent. Appendix Table A2 shows that this pattern is pervasive for the
sample of countries we construct based on the WIOD.
We are interested in understanding how changes in trade patterns affected relative
prices across sectors. We define the ’domestic expenditure share’ of each sector j in counj
try i, denoted by πii,t , as the ratio of expenditures on domestically produced goods or
services relative to total expenditures in that sector.10 Figure 2 reports domestic expenditure shares in 2007 relative to 1995 for the countries in our sample (see Appendix Table A3
for the exact values). The figure reveals that domestic expenditure shares in goods sectors
declined dramatically in most countries. In contrast, domestic expenditure shares in service sectors remained roughly constant in every country of our sample with the exception
of Denmark and Ireland. In the average country, the domestic expenditure share in goods
producing sectors declined by 18 percent, relative to only 2 percent for service sectors.
For the US these numbers are roughly 10 and 0 percent respectively. We summarize this
finding in the following observation:
Observation 1 Between 1995 and 2007, domestic expenditure shares in goods producing sectors declined dramatically, while domestic expenditure shares on service producing sectors remained roughly constant.
10 The

domestic expenditure share equals one minus the share of imports in total absorption. We focus
on changes in domestic expenditure shares because they summarize the effects of trade on relative price
movements in our model. This is a feature shared by most workhorse trade models (see Arkolakis, Costinot
and Rodriguez-Clare, 2012).

Sectoral trade patterns and skill intensities

We now report how skill intensities vary across broad sectors using data on employment
and educational attainment by sector from the WIOD Socio Economic Accounts. We classify workers with complete college education as skilled workers, and workers that have

not completed college as unskilled workers.11 In what follows, we let Hi and Li denote
skilled and unskilled employment in country i and sector j. We refer to the ’skill intensity’
of a sector as the ratio of skilled to unskilled workers in the sector relative to the ratio of
skilled to unskilled workers in the overall economy.12
Figure 3 plots the average skill intensities and the 1995-2007 changes in domestic expenditure shares in each one-digit ISIC Rev. 3 sector across countries in our sample. The
figure reveals that sectors in which domestic expenditure shares declined the most (Agriculture, Manufacturing and Mining) are unskilled-labor intensive. Among the sectors in
which domestic expenditure shares remained roughly constant, some are unskilled-labor
intensive (such as Construction and Retail), while some are skilled-labor intensive (such
as FIRE and Education). Appendix Figure A.2 shows that this pattern is pervasive across
countries. We summarize these findings in the following observation:
11 WIOD

Socio Economic Accounts sorts workers into 3 educational groups: “Low” (no college),
“Medium” (some college), and “High” (college graduate and above). We classify “Low” and “Medium”
education as unskilled workers, and classify the workers with “High” education as skilled workers.

Skill intensities and intermediate input shares

Finally, we report how the use of intermediate inputs from goods-producing sectors varies
across sectors with different skill intensities. In particular, we compute the share of intermediate inputs from goods-producing sectors in total output for each one-digit ISIC Rev.
3 sector using data from the WIOD as described in Appendix E.
Figure 4 plots skill intensities and the share of goods inputs by sector for the average country in our sample. The figure reveals that unskilled-labor intensive sectors use
more intermediate inputs from goods-producing sectors. This observation applies to both
goods-producing sectors (Agriculture, Manufacturing and Mining) and unskilled-labor
intensive service sectors (such as Construction and Hotels and Restaurants). In contrast,
skilled-labor intensive service sectors use relatively fewer inputs from the goods sector.
Appendix Figure A.3 documents the finding across countries, which is summarized in
the following observation:

Summary

The data in this section show that the sectors that experienced the sharpest declines in
domestic expenditure shares between 1995 and 2007 are unskilled-labor intensive. In addition, unskilled-labor intensive sectors use relatively more highly-traded intermediate
inputs than skilled-labor intensive sectors. In the following section, we present a quantitive trade model in which these differences across sectors shape how trade affects the
composition of value-added and employment across sectors and the skill premium.

Model
Setup

Preliminaries: We consider a world economy featuring I countries indexed by i and J
sectors indexed by j. Each country is endowed with Hi and Li efficiency units of skilled
and unskilled labor. The final output of each sector can be used for consumption or as
an intermediate input in the production of any sector. Within each sector j, there are

10

K j industries indexed by k.13 Heterogeneous producers use skilled and unskilled labor
to produce intermediate varieties in each of the industries. Producers differ in terms of
their productivity and the sector in which they produce. All labor and goods markets are
perfectly competitive.

13 While allowing for industries within sectors is not crucial for the direction of our mechanisms, the
quantitative effect of trade on relative prices does depend on the level of disaggregation at which trade
elasticities and the domestic expenditure shares are computed. Costinot and Rodriguez-clare (2014) and
Ossa (2015) show that the real wage gains from trade for the average country get larger as one moves from
a one-sector to a multi-sector model. Following the recent literature on international trade and real wages
(see for example, Costinot and Rodriguez-clare 2014, Caliendo and Parro 2015, Ossa 2015 and Levchenko
and Zhang 2016) we allow for multiple industries within sectors of our model, though we assume that all
industries within a given sector have identical factor intensities.

follow most of the quantitative trade literature in assuming that there is no value-added in the
production of sectorial and industrial output. An interpretation for why this output is not traded is that
the aggregation of intermediate varieties may be done by the households or the firms directly, so that the
bundles in equations 2 and (4) are not traded in the market.

common for all industries k within each sector j. The intermediate input bundle mi (ω, k )
lj
aggregates inputs from all sectors, where xi (ω, k ) denotes the use of inputs from sector
lj
l in the production of intermediate variety (ω, k) in sector j; the parameter ᾱi controls
the share of inputs from sector l on total input expenditures in sector j, and is common
across industries within sectors. The elasticity of substitution across inputs from different
sectors is the same as the elasticity of substitution across sectors in the consumption bundle, which is given by ρ. The employment bundle combines unskilled labor, l, and skilled
j
labor, h, with a constant elasticity of substitution γ, and the shares, µ̄i are sector but not
industry specific.
The productivity of country i producers of variety (ω, k ) is given by the product of a
j
country-industry specific term, Ai (k), shared by all industry k producers in the country,
j
and a country-intermediate-variety specific productivity, zi (ω, k ). Note that, up to the
j
j
productivity terms Ai (k ) zi (ω, k ) , the parameters of the production function are common
across all industries K j within each sector j. The country-intermediate-variety specific
j
j
productivity is equal to zi (ω, k) = u−θ (k) , where u is an i.i.d random variable that is
exponentially distributed with mean and variance 1. A higher value of θ j (k ) increases
the dispersion of productivities across producers within industry k.
International trade Only intermediate varieties can be traded internationally. Delivering a unit of intermediate variety (ω, k ) from country i to country n requires producing

τin (k ) ≥ 1 of the good. We assume that trading domestically is costless, τii (k ) = 1.

A competitive equilibrium is a set of prices and quantities such that all markets clear.
Each producer satisfies worldwide demand for its output. Sectoral output must satisfy
the resource constraints (3). The demand for unskilled and skilled labor across producers
must equal the endowments Li and Hi , respectively. The total demand for intermedij
ate inputs from each sector must equal Xi . The household’s budget constraints must be
satisfied. We fully characterize the equilibrium in Appendix A.1.

3.2

A simplified model to illustrate the mechanism

We start by solving a simplified version of our model to clarify the new mechanisms in
the paper. Consider a version of the model with two sectors, goods and services, indexed
by G and S, with only one industry in each sector. Assume further that the production of
goods uses only low-skilled labor, (µ̄G = 1, and βG = 1) that the production of services
uses only high-skilled labor (µ̄S = 0, and βS = 1), and that the parameters θ and φ̄ are
constant across sectors. Finally, to underscore that the effects of trade on sectorial valueadded shares and the skill-premium can go in the same direction in every country, we

14

focus on the case of symmetric countries are symmetric.15
In this version of the model, total compensation to high- and to low-skilled workers
equals value-added in the service and the goods sectors respectively. In addition, from
balanced trade (which follows from symmetry), and the assumption that there are no
intermediate inputs (β j = 1), sectorial value-added equals sectorial consumption expenditures. That is:

where v j denotes the share of sector j in total value added, and the last equality follows

to the domestic expenditure shares:

. Equation (9) shows that
more trade in goods relative to services (π G < π S or τ G < τ S ) results in a lower relative
price of goods in all countries. Combining equations (8) and (9) we can solve for the skill

Equations (10) and (11) show that, if goods and services are complements, ρ < 1, more
trade in goods relative to services (π G < π S or τ G < τ S ) is associated with a larger skill
premium and a smaller goods sector in terms of value added in all countries.16 The intuition is that more trade in goods reduces goods prices world wide, as shown in equation
(9).

3.3

International trade, structural change and the skill premium

We now examine the central forces shaping real wages, the skill premium, and the sectoral
composition of value-added and employment in the general model model described in
section 3.1, and evaluate what are the key elasticities that determine these forces. We start
by relating the skill premium to sectorial value added shares. Competitive factor markets

is the share of unskilled labor in sector j’s value-added, and vi is the

share of sector j in aggregate value-added.17 From equation (12), changes in country i’s
skill premium are fully determined by changes in country i’s endowments of skilled- and
j
unskilled-labor and by changes in sectoral value-added shares. Given µi ’s, an increase in
j
j
the size of the skilled labor intensive sectors (i.e. an increase in vi in sectors where µi is
low) increases the skill premium.
j
Changes in the skill premium will in turn affect factor shares µi ’s. To better understand
j
these forces we substitute for µi and take a first-order approximation to equation (12) in
Appendix B, which yields:

labor intensive sectors grow (ṽi > 0 in sectors where Hi > Li ). The direct effects of
i
i
these changes in the skill premium are magnified or mitigated depending on whether the
elasticity of substitution between skilled- and unskilled-labor is greater than 1 (which dej
termines the value of γ̄i ). If γ is greater than 1, a change in Hi /Li or vi ’s that increases the
skill premium is mitigated by an increase in the share of unskilled labor in value-added,
j
µi ’s, while the reverse is true when γ is smaller than 1.
j
Note that sectoral value-added shares, vi ’s, are endogenous, and depend on the entire matrix of trade costs (between each pair of countries and in each sector), changes
in net transfers to each country, changes in each country-sector specific productivities,
and changes in labor endowments in each country. We can show, however, that there
is a set of sufficient statistics that fully determine the equilibrium change in the skill
premium. Appendix A.3 presents a set of 23 equations from which, given changes in
these sufficient statistics, changes in sectorial value-added shares and changes in the
skill premium (and the real wages of skilled and unskilled workers) can be calculated
for any country i. In particular, given values of the elasticities of substitution (γ and ρ),
the dispersion of productivities in each industry θ j (k ), and factor shares in the initial
equilibrium, the change in country i’s skill premium depends only on changes in: (i ) a
weighted average of the industry-level domestic expenditure shares in each sector, given

Li . Importantly, conditional on (i ) − (iv), changes in trade costs, transfers, changes in
other countries’ technologies and endowments, and changes in all other trade shares do
not affect country i’s skill premium. That is, international trade costs, foreign technoloj
gies, transfers and foreign endowments only affect country i’s skill premium through πii
j
j
j
and λi . Moreover, given changes in πii and λi , we do not need to compute the multicountry general equilibrium model to calculate the change in country i’s skill premium.
We highlight that this result does not rely on the approximation. We exploit this property
of the model when we conduct Counterfactual 2 in Section 5.
3.3.1

Trade and structural change

We now show how changes in prices and sectorial net exports shape changes in valueadded shares by log-linearizing the equilibrium equations. To facilitate the exposition, we
j
focus on a special case of the model in which there are no intermediate inputs, β i = 1, and
j
make the approximation around λi = 1 (we relax these assumptions for the quantitive
17

exercises of Section 5, which do not rely on approximations). Appendix B shows that in
this case, first-order changes in sectoral value-added shares are given by:

where ri denotes the share of sector j in aggregate revenues.18 The first term in equation
(14) captures the effect of price changes on sectoral value-added shares. If the elasticity
of substitution across sectors is less than 1 (ρ < 1), sector j’s value-added share is inj j
creasing in its price relative to the price of the other sectors (summarized in ∑ j vi P̃i ). The
second term captures the effect of changes in sectoral trade deficits or surpluses. Other
j
things equal, an increase in a sector’s net exports relative to aggregate revenues (λ̃i > 0)
increases the sector’s share in value-added.
3.3.2

Trade, the skill premium and real wages

This section provides a first-order approximation for how changes in factor supplies, domestic expenditure shares, and sectorial net exports affect the skill premium. We continue

to abstract from intermediate inputs (β i = 1) and to approximate our results around

Equation (15) decomposes the change in the skill premium into three components.
The first component depends on the growth of skilled labor relative to unskilled labor,
and captures the relative supply effect already present in equation (13). All else equal, an
increase in the relative supply of skilled labor reduces the skill premium with an elasticity
of 1/Γi . The last two terms show how changes in trade patterns affect the skill premium.

sectors (i.e. a decline in the domestic expenditure share π ii in these sectors) results in an

in sectoral deficits affect sectoral revenue shares directly and indirectly, as explained in
equation (14) above. It shows that a decline in net exports in low skill intensive sectors

Real wages We now show how changes in domestic expenditure shares and sectorial
net exports shape changes in real wages for skilled and unskilled workers. Real wages
of skilled and unskilled workers are simply si /PiC and wi /PiC respectively, where PiC is
the consumption price index associated with the bundle in equation (1). We show in
Appendix B that changes in real skilled and unskilled wages are, to a first-order approximation, given by:

because a decline in λ̃ii reduces the size of the sector j without directly affecting the aggregate price index.

3.3.3

Trade and structural change

We conclude this section by relating changes in employment and value-added shares
across sectors to changes in trade patters. Appendix B shows that, to a first order ap19

Equations (18) and (19) state that, if ρ is less than one, sectorial value-added and employment shares are increasing in the sector’s domestic expenditure shares and decreasing
in the sector’s productivity. In addition, sectorial shares are increasing the sectorial net
j
exports, summarize in λi . In the following sections, we calibrate the model and conduct
two counterfactual exercises to quantify the impact of international trade on structural
change, real wages, and the skill premium.

4

Data and parameterization

To conduct the counterfactual exercises of the next section we need data on trade flows
and we need to assign values to our model’s parameters. In what follows, we first describe our data sources and discuss how we map them to the model. We then compute the
sectoral factor intensities, which according to equation (15) determine whether changes
in trade patterns are skilled biased. Next, we show how we pick values for the parameters and input shares in the model. Finally, we describe how we construct changes in
domestic expenditure shares and net exports to total revenue ratios.

4.1

Taking the model to sectoral data

We take the model to the data focusing on 3 sectors motivated by our observations from
Section 2: a goods-producing sector, j = G; and two service sectors, one that is skilled
labor intensive, j = F, and one that is unskilled labor intensive, j = S. We start by briefly
discussing how we aggregate industries to match the sectors in the model. Our main sam20

ple combines input-output data from the WIOD with data on employment and compensations from the WIOD Socio Economic Accounts. We follow Costinot and Rodriguezclare (2014) and include seven small economies in WIOD into the “Rest of the World”
category, so that we are left with a sample of 34 countries.20 While WIOD data covers
the 1995-2011 period, we mainly focus on the 1995-2007 to exclude the great trade collapse and the great recession from our sample.21 We classify the sectors of the IO tables
into the three sectors of our model as follows: i) goods G (including Agriculture, Mining,
and Manufacturing), ii) skilled-labor intensive services F (including Finance and Insurance, Real Estate, Health, and Education), and iii) unskilled-labor intensive services S
(including the remaining services).22 Within sector G industries k correspond to the most
disaggregated industrial classification available in WIOD (see Table A1).
Trade data We use the IO tables to compute bilateral trade shares and the ratios of secj
torial net exports to aggregate revenue ratio. The trade shares πin (k ) are the spending of
country n in imports from country i relative to total absorption in industry k in sector j,
where absorption is defined as gross output plus imports minus exports. To calculate the
j
net export to revenue ratios, λi , we measure revenues as gross output, and net exports at
the level of the broad sector j.

4.2

Parameterization

According to equations (A.18)-(A.23), the key moments and parameters that determine
how changes in trade patterns affect the skill premium are: (i) the sectoral factor intenj
j
sities Hi /Hi and Li /Li in the initial equilibrium, (ii) the share of unskilled labor in total
labor payments in the initial equilibrium, µi , (iii) the industrial shares in aggregate abj
j
sorption in the goods sector, σi (k ), (iv) the sectoral value-added shares, β i , (v) the shares
lj
of inputs from each sector that are used in the sectoral input bundles, αi , (vi) the trade
elasticities θ j (k), (vii) the elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled labor, γ,
and (viii) the elasticity of substitution across sectors, ρ. We describe how we assign these
values below.23
20 Following

Costinot and Rodriguez-clare (2014), we include Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, and Malta in the expanded ROW category.
21 We exclude the trade collapse and the recession as the model is not designed to measure how high
frequency shocks affect labor market outcomes.
22 That is, Utilities, Construction, Wholesale and Retail Trade, Hotels and Restaurants, Transport and
Communications, and Other Community, Social and Personal Services.
23 From these, one can infer other initial shares, such as φ j and µ j .

21

Factor and input shares We follow the skill classification described in Section 2 and use
j
data from WIOD Socio Economic Accounts to compute the sectoral skill intensities Hi /Hi
j
and Li /Li , which we report in Appendix Table A5. We measure the share of unskilled
labor in total labor payments, µi , as the ratio of labor compensation to unskilled workers
relative to total labor compensation. We use data from IO tables (WIOD) to compute
σiG (k ) as industry k’s share in total absorption in the goods sector in the initial year. We
j
calculate the sectoral value-added shares, β i , as the ratio of value-added to gross output
in each sector, also using the Input-Output Tables. We construct the input shares in each
lj
sector’s input bundle, αi , as the share of expenditures in intermediate inputs from sector
l relative total input expenditures by sector j. The resulting value-added and input shares
are reported Appendix Table A6.
Elasticities Finally, we calibrate the trade elasticities, 1/θ j (k ), and the elasticities of substitution across workers and across sectors, γ and ρ. The first two elasticities are taken
directly from the literature. We take the industry-level trade elasticities 1/θ j (k ) from
Caliendo and Parro (2015) (see Appendix Table A1). We set γ = 1.51, to match an aggregate elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled workers of Γ = 1.42 in the
US, following Katz and Murphy (1992).
While an extensive literature has studied how low elasticities of substitution across
sectors can shape structural change, there are three important differences between the
structural parameter ρ in our model and most estimates of the elasticity of substitution
across sectors in this literature.24 First, while the structural transformation literature typically breaks sectors into agriculture, manufacturing and services, the sectoral breakdown
in our model is across goods, low-skilled services, and high-skilled services. Second,
while the elasticity is typically estimated from consumption data, the parameter ρ in our
model simultaneously governs the elasticity of substitution in the consumption- and in
j j
the input-bundles. Finally, the definition of consumption expenditures Pi Ci in our model
cannot be mapped directly to either the ’final-expenditure’ nor to the ’value-added’ data
described in Herrendorf, Rogerson and Valentinyi (2013), a point we discuss in detail
below.
With this in mind, we estimate ρ from time series data on prices and expenditure
shares in the US in a way that is consistent with our model, following the macro-approach
24 For

example, Buera, Kaboski and Rogerson (2015) use an elasticity of 0.2. Kehoe, Ruhl and Steinberg
(2013) use an elasticity 0.5 in the consumption bundle, and a Leontief input bundle. Comin, Lashkari and
Mestieri (2015) estimate an elasticity around 0.65. Herrendorf, Rogerson and Valentinyi (2013) estimate
an elasticity of 0.85 using final consumption expenditure data, and of roughly 0 when using value-added
expenditure data.

22

in Herrendorf, Rogerson and Valentinyi (2013) and Comin, Lashkari and Mestieri (2015).
For our baseline estimation, we allow for non-homotheticities in consumption demand
using a generalized CES aggregator, as in Comin, Lashkari and Mestieri (2015).25 In particular, Appendix F derives the following demand system:

Here e j is a parameter that governs the income elasticity of consumption of goods from
j jl
sector j, and Pi xi denotes expenditures on inputs from sector j by producers in sector
l = S, G, F.
Herrendorf, Rogerson and Valentinyi (2013) note that elasticity estimates based on final expenditure data are higher than estimates based on value-added data, as final expenditures are produced using intermediate inputs that contain value-added from multiple
sectors. As noted above, the expenditure shares and relative prices in our model cannot
be measured directly with either final consumption expenditure data nor with the consumption value-added data constructed by Herrendorf, Rogerson and Valentinyi (2013).
On the one hand, data on final consumption expenditures includes distribution margins,
but our model does not have a distribution sector (note that consumption in retail, wholesale trade, and transport are all included in the unskilled labor intensive service sector in
our parameterization). On the other hand, while consumption value-added data as measured by Herrendorf, Rogerson and Valentinyi (2013) subtracts the input content from
consumption expenditures, the value of intermediate inputs is included in the sectoral

consumption expenditures in our model, Pi Ci .26 Measuring expenditure shares in a way
that is consistent with our model thus requires measuring how the gross output of each
sector, valued at producer prices (i.e. before distribution margins are applied), is used in
the economy. Appendix F describes in detail how we construct expenditure shares at producer prices using the Input-Output Use Tables for the US, and how we construct sectoral
producer price indexes using the Chain-Type Price Indexes for Gross Output published

note that this aggregator nests the CES aggregator in our baseline model, so that we can estimate
the elasticity of substitution while allowing for non-homotheticities without loss of generality. Our model
can be easily extended to allow for non-homotheticities as shown in Appendix C. We opted to keep the
baseline model homothetic to facilitate exposition, since as shown in the next section, allowing for nonhomotheticies does not affect our main results.
26 That is, while the value of intermediate inputs is not counted in the consumption value-added data, the
sectoral production functions in our model are not value-added production functions.

by the BEA.
Figure A.4 plots the relative prices and relative expenditure shares in consumptionand each of the input-bundles. Both the price and the expenditure shares of skilled labor intensive services relative to goods rose during this period, which is consistent with
an elasticity of substitution smaller than 1. These changes in relative expenditure shares
are similar for the consumption and all of the input bundles. In addition, a similar pattern arises also for the relative price and relative expenditure shares of unskilled labor
intensive services vs goods. Overall, the strong positive comovements of prices and expenditure shares are indicative of strong complementarities across sectors.
Columns 1 to 4 of Table A7 report the results of estimating equations (20) and (21)
for l = S, G, F using iterated feasible generalized nonlinear least square estimation, as
Herrendorf, Rogerson and Valentinyi (2013). To constrain the elasticity of substitution to
be positive, we make the transformation ρ = eb0 and estimate the unconstrained parameter b0 ∈ (−∞, +∞). The estimate for ρ is statistically less than 1 in all of the columns,
and indicates an elasticity of substitution of 0.59 when estimated using the consumption
bundle and of roughly 0 when estimated using the input bundles. The last column simultaneously estimates the 4 equations for the consumption and input bundles, imposing
the restriction that the elasticity of substitution should be the same across the equations.
The resulting elasticity of substitution suggest a Leontief aggregator. With these results
in mind, we pick a value within the range of our estimates and set ρ = 0.2 in our baseline
calibration.

Quantitative results

This section quantifies how international trade affects sectorial employment, value-added,
real wages and the skill premium in our model. We conduct two counterfactual exercises
to measure these effects, compare the implications of the model to the data, provide evidence of the mechanisms in the paper, and show how our quantitative results change
under alternative parameterizations. We then show that measures based on the factor
content of trade greatly underestimate the effect of trade on the skill premium in our
model.

5.1

Counterfactual 1: Changes in trade costs between 1995 and 2007

Our first counterfactual directly evaluates the effect of changes in trade costs between
1995 and 2007 on the sectorial composition of the economy and on the skill premium
24

across countries. We begin by measuring changes in bilateral trade costs from changes in
bilateral expenditure shares, following the approach in Head and Ries (2001). In particular, we use equation (7) to write the change in trade costs between two periods as

year, that is, x̂ ≡ xx01 . Assuming symmetric trade costs, τ̂ni (k ) = τ̂in (k) , and given values
for the trade elasticities θ j (k), we use equation (22) to estimate the changes in trade costs
j
from observed changes in bilateral trade patterns, π̂ni (k). We then follow the “exact
hat algebra” approach in Dekle, Eaton and Kortum (2008) to compute the equilibrium
response to these changes in trade costs.27
5.1.1

Changes in trade shares
j

We begin by reporting how domestic expenditure shares πii change in response to the
changes in trade costs we estimate. Figure 5 shows that the counterfactual changes in
domestic expenditure shares line up well with those observed in the 1995-2007 data. In
the goods sector, regressing the changes in expenditure shares in the data on those generated by the counterfactual generates an R-squared of 0.8 and a slope that is close to 1.
The changes in trade costs also do a good job in accounting for the observed changes in
domestic expenditure shares in the service sectors for most countries, with the notable
exceptions of Hungary and Slovakia, where expenditure shares decline dramatically in
the counterfactual equilibrium but increase in the data. We show below that our results
are not driven by these two countries. Crucially, in the counterfactual equilibrium as in
the data, the decline in domestic expenditure shares is much larger in the goods sector
than in the services sectors for all countries with the exception of Ireland.
5.1.2

Structural change

Figures 6 and 7 compare the counterfactual changes in value-added and employment
shares to those observed in the data.28 As explained in Section 3.3, the declines in do27 Appendix

A.3 characterizes the changes in the equilibrium of our model as a function of changes in
the model’s fundamentals (trade cost, endowments, productivities and transfers). Counterfactual 1 is computed by feeding in the changes in trade costs implied by equation (22), and keeping the other fundamentals
fixed.
28 The exact numbers behind this figure are listed in Appendix Table A8.

mestic expenditure shares in the goods sector reported in Figure 5 lead to a decline of the
goods sector relative to the service sectors. As a result, the counterfactual share of the
goods sector in value-added falls in most countries, by 8.5 percent in the average country,
and by 12.3 percent in the US. Likewise, the counterfactual share of employment in the
goods sector also declines in most countries, by an average of 8.2 percent. The figures
reveal a great deal of heterogeneity in these counterfactual changes across sectors and
countries, ranging from -20 to 5 percent for goods, and from about -10 to 20 in skilledlabor intensive services. In most countries, skilled-labor intensive services expand faster
than unskilled-labor intensive services, because in the model, as in the data, the later uses
relatively more intermediate inputs from the goods sector.
Figures 6 and 7 show that, as in the data, the goods sector shrinks in most countries, although the contraction in the data is larger. This is not surprising given that the
counterfactual abstracts from other forces that could have generated structural change,
such as productivity growth in the goods sector (see equations 18 and 19). More importantly, there is a statistically significant relation between the changes in the counterfactual and those in the data, and we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the slope of
a regression between the observed and counterfactual changes in value-added shares is
equal to one (this is also true when we consider changes in employment shares). Thus,
while the counterfactual misses part of the global decline in employment in the goods
sector (which could be attributed to global changes in productivity, AG ), the reduction in
trade costs substantially contributes to understanding how the goods-sector decline has
differed across countries.29 Note that an important fraction of the heterogeneity is not
captured by the changes in trade costs, reflecting the reality that countries differ along
multiple dimensions in addition to the ones emphasized in the counterfactual (such as
j
country-specific changes in productivity, Ãi ). Appendix Figure A.1 shows that the model
can also account for the global decline in employment in the goods sector in a counterfactual where we change both trade costs and global productivity in the goods sector, AG ,
where the change in global productivity is calibrated to match the decline in the goods
sector employment share in the US (see Appendix G).
5.1.3

Changes in net exports vs price effects

As discussed in Section 3.3, changes in trade costs affect the equilibrium both through
j
j
domestic expenditure shares, πii ’s, and through sectorial net exports, λi ’s. In this section
29 These

findings are robust to excluding Hungary and Slovakia from the sample, countries for which
our trade costs estimates imply a large counterfactual decline in the domestic expenditure share in skilled
services.

we disentangle the contribution of these two effects to the results presented above. To do
so, we re-compute Counterfactual 1 in a calibration where the elasticity of substitution
across sectors is set to ρ = 1, so that sectorial absorption shares are constant. As noted
in equations (18) and (19), in this case trade only affects value-added and employment
j
shares through sectorial net exports, summarized in λi .
Figure 8 presents the counterfactual changes in the share of the goods sector in valueadded and employment in this calibration. The goods sector grows for about half of the
countries: on average it increases by 1.1 percent in terms of its share in value-added,
and by 0.9 percent in terms of its share in employment. This stands in contrast to the
results in Figures 6 and 7, where the goods sector shrinks in most countries. In addition,
both the slope and the R-squared of the regression between the counterfactual predictions
and the data fall dramatically relative to the baseline calibration. We conclude that price
effects play an important role in shaping how the sectorial composition of the economy is
affected by trade.

age of 3.2 percent. The notable exceptions are Slovakia and Hungary, countries for which
the high-skill intensive sector shrinks in the counterfactual equilibrium. The change in
the skill premium is especially large in developing countries where the goods sector is
particularly unskilled-labor intensive, such as Turkey, Romania, Portugal or Poland. In
the US, the counterfactual generates a modest increase in the skill premium of 0.8 percent.
Columns 2 and 3 in first panel of Table A9 report the predicted changes in real wages for
skilled and unskilled workers in this Counterfactual. Note that, while in most countries
the counterfactual skill premium increases, unskilled workers gain from the reduction in
trade costs in all countries.
To understand the size of the change of the skill premium in this counterfactual, consider equation (15) again. The change in the skill premium depends on the sectoral skill
intensities in the initial equilibrium and the changes in domestic expenditure shares. Figure 9 reflects this result, showing that skill intensity in 1995 is positively correlated with
the counterfactual changes in the skill premium. Since by 1995 the fraction of both types
of workers in the goods sectors was already very small in most developed countries, the
decline of the goods sector on wages in those countries has a limited effect. Unfortunately,
we cannot extend this counterfactual back in time, since bilateral data on service trade for
many of our countries is only available starting in 1995. In the next section, we build on
the theoretical results from Section 3 and take a sufficient statistic approach for measuring
the effects of trade on the skill premium.

31

5.1.5

Inspecting the mechanisms: within-sector skill upgrading vs between-sector reallocation

We conclude this section by providing additional evidence on the mechanisms through
which changes in trade patterns affect the skill premium in the model. As in the HeckscherOhlin model, trade affects the skill premium in our model by inducing reallocation of labor from unskilled labor intensive sectors to skilled labor intensive sectors. If trade were
the only driver of the observed changes in the skill premium, we should expect to see
labor reallocating from unskilled labor intensive sectors to skilled labor intensive sectors,
coupled skill downgrading within each sector (due to the rise in the skill premium). A
large and influential literature has measured the extent of within-sector skill upgrading
and between-sector factor reallocation and argued that, since most of the shift in demand
for skilled labor is accounted for by within sector skill upgrading, the increase in the
skill premium is likely to be driven by skill biased technical change.30 While this view
is consistent with a version of our model that incorporates global skill biased technical
change, we ask instead: can trade account for the observed differences in within-sector
skill upgrading across countries? The answer speaks directly to our mechanism, since the
model predicts that, other things equal, between reallocation should be larger the larger
the change in trade costs in the goods sector (and hence the contribution of within skill
upgrading should be smaller).
With this objective in mind, we decompose changes in the share of skilled labor in
employment, HE,i ≡ H H+i L , into changes in skilled labor shares within each industry,

between the contribution of within-sector skill upgrading in the counterfactual and in
the data. The second panel shows that, if we simulate the model without changes in
trade costs, the correlation between the counterfactual and the data falls dramatically.
We conclude that reductions in trade costs are an important factor in accounting for the
cross-country variation in the contribution of within-sector skill upgrading.

Counterfactual 2: Using observed changes in trade patterns as sufficient statistics

allows us to explore a broader notion of the impact of trade on structural change and the

Equation (24) answers the question: What are the additional effects of changes in primitives on the skill premium and real wages in an open economy relative to the effects in a
closed economy? From equation (24), we can answer this question (to a first order approximation) using observable changes in domestic sectoral expenditure shares and revenue
to absorption ratios, with no need to observe the underlying changes in primitives. Table
A4 presents the changes in πiiG and λiG used to conduct this quantitative exercise.

discussion that follows is based on Corollary 1 in Burstein, Cravino and Vogel (2013).

Notes: The figures report the percent change in the share of value-added and employment in the goods
sector in Counterfactual 2. The x-axis reports the weighted change in domestic expenditure shares for each
j
country, π̂iiG , and the y-axis reports the change in value-added and employment shares, v̂iG and ω̂ i,E .

5.2.1

Observed changes in trade patterns, structural change and the skill premium
j

We start by showing the results of the counterfactual when we use the changes in π̂ii
j
and λ̂i we observe between 1995 and 2007 for each country. The predictions of the secj
j
ond counterfactual in response to the changes in πii and λi are summarized in Figure
11. Dots in the figure relate the counterfactual changes in sectoral value-added shares,
j
v̂i , to the counterfactual changes in the domestic expenditure shares in the goods sector.
For the average country in our sample, the counterfactual share of the goods sector in
value-added declines by approximately a 10 percent. Larger declines in the domestic expenditure shares in the goods sector are associated with larger declines of the size of the
goods sector. The decline of the goods sector is larger for those countries that experienced
a large increase in their goods-trade deficits, such as the US.
The counterfactual changes in the skill premium are summarized in Figure 12. For
the average country in our sample, the model generates a 3.8 percent increase in the skill
premium in response to the observed changes in trade patterns. Note that the increase is
larger in countries with large declines in domestic expenditure shares, such as Hungary,
Turkey and Slovenia. The change in the skill premium is especially large in developing
countries where the good producing sectors are particularly unskilled labor intensive,
with the exception of China and Indonesia, where domestic expenditure shares are constant or mildly increase. For most countries, international factors summarized in these
changes either increased the skill premium or had a negligible effect on it. For the skill
premium, these changes are larger on average than those in the first counterfactual. For

structural change, the difference depends on the country. The reason is that this counterfactual takes into account all the effects of changes in trade patterns, rather than focusing
on those that arise from changes in trade costs. For example, even with constant trade
costs, cross-country changes in productivity can increase or decrease net exports. In the
next section, we further extend this exercise to go back in time for countries in which data
on both IO tables and employment shares are available.
5.2.2

Trade patterns, structural change and the skill premium over longer horizons

We conclude this section by extending the second counterfactual to go further back in
time.33 Given the large reallocation of activity away from the goods sectors in developed
countries in the decades before 1995 (e.g. in the US and the UK), our previous exercise
might underestimate the role that trade has played in those countries. With the sufficient
statistic approach, we can conduct the second counterfactual for individual countries for
which the required data are available.
Table 1 reports the results of this exercise. Not surprisingly, for these countries, the
decline in domestic expenditure shares is larger over this longer period. As a consequence
the associated decline in value-added and employment shares in the goods sector are
33 We

bring in Input-Output data from the OECD, for which the start year ranges from 1977 to 1990,
depending on the country. We combine it with data on employment and compensation from KLEMS. We
process these data in the same way as described in Section 4. Only 6 countries contain data from both
sources.

larger than those in Figure 11. In the US, the manufacturing employment share declines
by 20 percent in this counterfactual, relative to the 45 percent that we see over this period.
In addition, since for these countries the share of employment in the goods sector was
larger at the beginning of this sample than in 1995, the elasticity of the skill premium
with respect to changes in domestic expenditure shares in the goods sector is larger than
in the previous counterfactual (see equation 15). Therefore, the associated increase in
the skill-premium is also larger for all countries. Although the increase of 3.1 percent in
the US skill premium over this period is now is much larger than before, it is still small
relative to the 40 percent estimated by Krueger et al. (2010) for the 1980-2006 period.

5.3

Alternative parameterizations

This section evaluates the importance of our modeling choices for our quantitative results. First, we evaluate the quantitative importance of incorporating intermediate inputs
into the model. Second, we evaluate the importance of the differences in skill and input intensities across the service sectors by simulating a two sector model in which the
skilled and unskilled labor intensive services are aggregated into a single sector. Finally,
we evaluate how our results change if we allow for non-unitary income elasticities in
consumption demand. Under these alternative calibrations, we perform the same type of
sufficient statistic exercise as in Counterfactual 2.
No intermediate inputs We start by evaluating the importance of incorporating intermediate inputs for our quantitative results. To do so, we recalibrate the model imposing
37

j

that the share of the employment bundle is equal to one in each sector, β i = 1, and recalculate the change in the skill premium under Counterfactual 2. The resulting changes
in the skill premium are compared to those under the baseline parameterization in Figure
13a. The figure shows that the skill premium increases in most countries under the two
calibrations. However, the increase in the skill premium is smaller in the model with no
intermediates relative to the baseline in all countries, and about half of that in the baseline calibration for in the average country, which reveals that accounting for intermediate
inputs is important for establishing the magnitude of our quantitative results.
Two sector model We now evaluate the importance of incorporating differences in skill
intensities across services in our model by calibrating an economy with just two sectors:
goods and services. Note that this is equivalent to a three sector economy in which the
two service sectors are identical. Hence, we re-calibrate all the sectoral shares in the service sectors to match the aggregate service shares in each economy. We then conduct
Counterfactual 2 in this economy and compare the results to those obtained from our
baseline calibration. The resulting changes in the skill premium are reported in Figure
13b. For the average country, the increase in the skill premium is 29 percent smaller in
the two sector model than in our baseline calibration. Note, however, that the two models predict roughly the same decline in the employment share of the goods sector. The
differences in the models arise from the fact that, in the baseline model, sector F grows
by more than sector S, since it uses relatively more intermediate inputs from the goods
sector. Since sector F uses skilled labor more intensively, this magnifies the increase in
the skill premium. This extra effect is not present when the service sectors are identical.
We conclude that accounting for the differences in factor intensities across service sectors
is important for quantifying the effects of trade integration on structural change and the
skill premium.
Non-homothetic Preferences Finally, we extend our baseline model to allow for nonhomotheticities in demand. In particular, we assume that consumers aggregate goods
from different sectors with the generalized CES aggregator used by Comin, Lashkari and
Mestieri (2015). Appendix C shows how the equilibrium conditions of our model are
changed with this extension, and discusses how we parameterize the income elasticities of the different sectors following Comin, Lashkari and Mestieri (2015).34 Figure 13c
34 In

particular, to give the non-homothetic model the biggest chance to have a differential impact on the
skill premium, we calibrate the income elasticities e j using the values reported in the first column of Table
A7 (this is the specification that gives the largest differences in the income elasticities across sectors).

does not greatly affect the results for the skill premium.

Measuring the skill premium using the factor content of trade

We conclude this section by assessing, in the context of our model, an alternative approach that has been used in the literature to measure the impact of trade on factor prices:
the factor content of trade (FCT).35 The FCT measures the quantity of a factor that is em35 See

e.g. Katz and Murphy (1992).

39

bodied in a country’s net exports. Intuitively, an increase in the trade-adjusted supply of
a factor should decrease the factor’s price. We first use our model to measure changes in
the FCT implied by Counterfactuals 1 and 2. Then we show that these measured changes
greatly underestimate the model’s predictions for the changes in the skill premium.
We start by deriving an expression that formally links the FCT to the skill premium.
Appendix D shows that we can write the skill premium as:

where FCTiL ≡

Deardorff and Staiger (1988) and Burstein and Vogel (2011) show in a class of models that,


supplies and the FCT, captured by Li − FCTiL / Hi − FCTiH . In that context, changes
in the FCT are sufficient statistics for the effect of trade on the skill premium. Clearly,
these conditions are not satisfied in our model, where both sectoral absorption shares
and factor shares change in response to changes in trade patterns.36 The FCT approach,
therefore, does not capture all of the effects of trade on the skill premium.
Figure 14 compares the counterfactual change in the skill premium to the changes in
the skill premium that we measure from the counterfactual changes in the first term of
equation (25).37 The figures show that the change in the FCT greatly underestimates the
counterfactual changes in the skill premium in our model in almost every country. In
fact, the FCT-based measure moves in the opposite direction to the counterfactual skill
premium for about half the countries in Counterfactual 1, and for about fifteen percent of
the countries in Counterfactual 2.
36 Burstein and Vogel (2016) also note that the FCT cannot be measured from sectoral data if exporters and
domestic firms use different technologies. While the FCT is not a sufficient statistic for the skill premium
in their context (the term Φi is not constant in their framework), they show that if measured accurately, the
FCT does provide a good approximation to the effect of trade on the skill premium. This not the case in our
context, even if the FCT is perfectly measured.

Conclusion

Goods-producing sectors are intensive in unskilled labor. In this paper we used a quantitative model to study how increased trade integration in these sectors affects the skill
premium by inducing a reallocation of labor towards service sectors in all countries.
Changes in trade costs between 1995 and 2007 generate an 8.5 percent decline in the size
of the goods sector in our model, and account well for the cross-country differences in the
changes in the size of the goods sector. The observed changes in trade patterns of the past
three decades can generate roughly half of the observed decline in the value added share
of the goods-producing sector. These changes can in turn generate sizable increases in the
skill premium in all countries (2.3 percent on average). The increase in the skill premium
is larger in developing countries where the goods sector is particularly unskilled-labor
intensive.

Note that, after choosing a numeraire, (30 × I − 1 + I × I × (K S + K G + K F )) aggregate
variables must be determined in equilibrium. Equations (A.1)-(A.11) and (7) give a system of (30 × I − 1 + I × I × (K S + K G + K F )) independent equations, since the market
clearing conditions together with the budget constraints and the definition of revenues
make one budget constraint redundant.

Solving for price changes

We now combine equations (A.3), (A.4), (A.5), (A.12), and (A.13) to solve for changes in
sectorial value-added shares and the skill premium as a function of changes in domestic
expenditure shares and the ratio of sectorial net exports relative to GDP. We solve for all
the variables in changes following Dekle, Eaton and Kortum (2008). Define x̂ ≡ x1 /x0 .

We use the hat algebra in the system of equations above to conduct our alternative
parameterization exercise in Section (5.3). To give the non-homothetic model the biggest
chance to have a differential impact on the skill premium, we calibrate the income elasticities e j using the values reported in the first column of Table A7 (this is the specification that gives the largest differences in the income elasticities across sectors). Our
results in the main body show that even in this parameterization, accounting for nonhomotheticities has small effects on our quantitative results.

Appendix D

The factor content of trade

This section shows how the skill premium can be written as a function of the factor content of

Data and Parameterization

This section first describes our data sources and then explains how these are combined to
parameterize our model.

E.1

Data Sources

Our main sample combines two data sources. We use the IO tables from the World Input Output Database (WIOD) to construct changes in domestic expenditure shares, net
export to aggregate revenue ratios, intermediate input shares β j and αij , and sectorial
value-added shares. We use the Socio Economic Accounts included in the WIOD (SEA)
j
j
to calculate baseline employment shares, Hi /Hi and Li /Li , aggregate payments to skilled
relative to unskilled labor, si Hi /wi Li , and aggregate employment shares.
In Section 5.2.2, to extend our sample backward in time, we also bring in data on IO
tables from the OECD IO tables (1995 version) and data on employment and labor compensation from KLEMS. We use these data in the same way as described in the previous
paragraph.
Table A1 provides our own concordance to aggregate industries across datasets and
levels of aggregation, and the trade elasticity in each industry and sector. We use different
levels of aggregation in the paper, depending on the calculation. The column “Category”
lists our most disaggregated industries, which correspond with the index k in the paper.
The next column, “One Digit”, aggregates the sector G industries that correspond to manufacturing; we use this classification for illustration purposes in Figures 1 and 3. Finally,
the column “Sector” classifies industries into goods, unskilled and skilled labor intensive
services.
In the following sub-sections, we describe the datasets and their use in detail.
World Input-Output Tables For each year between 1995 and 2007, we observe the input
output tables and bilateral trade shares from the World Input-Output Tables Database
(WIOD), with industries disaggregated according to ISIC rev 3. These data are available
at http://www.wiod.org/new_site/database/niots.htm. Column “WIOD code” in Table
A1 lists the original industrial classification of the dataset and how we use it to compute
industry and sector aggregates. We exclude “Private Households with Employed Persons
(P)” from the calculations.
The WIOD also extends the labor and compensation data from KLEMS in its own
Socio Economic Accounts module. For each year, we observe the share of total hours em56

ployed in each industry, corresponding to the hours of each skill type in {Low, Medium,
High}, where “High” includes workers with a college degree. We also observe, for each
industry, the total hours employed, which allows us to calculate, for each labor type, the
total hours of employment. We also observe total compensation for {Low, Medium, High}
skills, which we use to compute the ratio sH/wL.
OECD Input-Output Tables We download the data from http://www.oecd.org/trade/inputoutputtables.htm, 1995 edition (ISIC Rev 2). Coverage is sparse until the 1990s. The earliest observations we use are for the year 1977, but the beginning of the sample varies
by country. Column “OECD Description” in Table A1 lists all disaggregated industries
in this dataset and shows how we aggregate them into the sectors and industries of our
model. We exclude the categories “Other producers” , “Statistical discrepancies”, and
“Private household activities” from the analysis.
One limitation of this dataset is that Education and Health are aggregated into the category “Community, social & personal services.” Since we interpret Education as skilled
labor intensive and Other services as unskilled labor intensive, we split this category into
sectors S and F according to the 1995 share of Education in Education + Other Services
for the US, 0.75, from WIOD.
KLEMS We downloaded data at http://www.euklems.net/, March 08 release: (i) Labour
input files and (ii) Country basic files. For Canada we repeat the same steps, but we use
separate files (also available in the KLEMS webpage). KLEMS provides yearly data from
1970 to 2005, disaggregated by ISIC Rev. 3 industries. We treat these data just as the
WIOD SEA data. Finally, we also obtain data on total revenue and absorption. Column
“KLEMS Code” in Table A1 relates the original industrial classification in KLEMS to ours.
We drop Private Households with Employed Persons (P).

E.2

Data construction

In this section, we discuss details on data construction not contained in the main body of
the paper.
E.2.1

Sample

Table A2 reports the countries in our main sample, all of them starting in 1995 and ending
in 2007. For Section 5.2.2, we strived to maximize coverage across countries and time. The
resulting sample is the largest possible panel for which we could obtain data on both employment shares and input-output data. We provide next the details of the construction
of our variables and the splicing across datasets.
E.2.2

Constructing sectoral changes in trade shares and net exports to total revenue
ratios

Table A1 shows the correspondence between the classification in the OECD IO data and
the classification in the WIOD data. The table also reports the classification we con57

structed to bridge the different levels of aggregation of these two classifications (which
correspond to k in our model), and how we associated industries to the trade elasticities from Caliendo and Parro (2015). The calculation of the sectoral trade shares requires
choosing a single elasticity for the “Auto and Other Transport” and “Electrical, Communication and Medical”, and “Basic Metals and Metal Products” categories. In these cases,
we chose the average elasticity.
E.2.3

Share of intermediate inputs in total revenue 1 − β j and share of each sector

in the intermediate input bundle αlj

For each country and sector, we calculate at the beginning of the sample,
1 − βj =

Sector

j0 s

Sector j’s Total Intermediate Use
,
Total Intermediate Use + Sector j0 s Value Added

where Sector j0 s Total Intermediate Use is measured as Total Intermediate Use of S, G,
and F (Imported and Domestic). Sector j0 s value-added is measured as Sector j0 s Total
Output less all inputs purchased by aggregate sector j.
We measure the share of sector l in the intermediate input bundle used in sector j,
which we denote by αlj , as
αlj =

Estimating the elasticity of substitution across
sectors

This section provides details for our estimation of the elasticity ρ in Section 4. Equation
(20) in the paper follows from taking ratios and logs in the demand functions in equation (C.2) for sectors j and j0 . Equation (21) follows from aggregating the input demand
functions across producers and industries,

and then taking logs and differences across inputs l.
To estimate equations (20) and (21), we measure expenditure shares in a way that is
consistent with our model, which requires measuring how gross output of each sector, valued at producer prices (i.e. before distribution margins are applied), is used in the economy.
We measure expenditure shares at producer prices using the US Input-Output Use Tables
for every year in the 1977-2012 period. In particular, we group the sectors in the InputOutput Tables into the sectors of our model following the definitions from Appendix E
and compute the share of each sector in total consumption expenditures and in total intermediate inputs used by the goods, unskilled and skilled intensive service sectors. We

construct sector specific price indexes from the Chain-Type Price Indexes for Gross Output by NAICS 2-digit Industry published by the BEA. We aggregate these prices using
the yearly expenditure shares of the US Input-Output Tables to construct chain-weighted
price indexes for the three broad sectors in our model. We compute aggregate consumption expenditures per capita, Ci , from the Input-Output data Chain-Type Price index data.
In particular, we aggregate final private consumption at producer prices and aggregate
the Chain-Type Price Indexes using the consumption expenditure shares to construct an
aggregate price index for consumption at producers prices that is consistent with our
other data. We compute Ci,t as final consumption divided by the price index, divided by
population.

Appendix G

Global productivity growth in the goods sector

In this counterfactual we augment Counterfactual 1 with global productivity growth.
That is, in addition to declines in trade costs obtained from (22), we assign ÂiG = ÂG
to every country i, and we calibrate ÂG such that the model exactly replicates the decline
in the US employment share in the goods sector between 1995 and 2007.
Figure A.1 compares the results of this counterfactual to the data, with a 45-degree
line as a reference. The figure shows that once we allow for global productivity change
to account for the changes in good employment in the US, then the counterfactual can
account quite well for the decline in the share of employment in the goods sector in most
countries.
