Government Saving, Capital Formation and Wealth
in the United States, 1947-1985

ABSTRACT
This paper presents new updated and improved estimates of various
components of governments' contribution to national wealth and its growth in
the post-war period. The primary conclusions drawn are:

1. The federal government's assets, tangible and financial, are
substantial; they grew more rapidly than the national debt in the l970s.
By 1980, federal tangible assets amounted to $1.7 trillion and financial
assets $940 billion, compared to liabilities of $1.5 trillion (in 1985
dollars);
2. Since 1980, conventional liabilities have grown much faster than
assets, causing about a $727 billion decline in federal "net worth";
3. The state-local government sector contributes importantly to
government and national wealth. State-local fixed reproducible capital is
twice the federal amount, about $1.9 trillion in 1985. The difference
between assets and liabilities is both larger and more stable for statelocal governments than for the federal government. The estimated "net
worth" of state-local governments is $2.5 trillion in both 1980 and 1985;

4. Total government reproducible capital was about 55% of the
corresponding private non-residential capital stock in 1985;
5. Government net investment has often been sufficient to turn the
government sector into a net saver despite large budget deficits;
6. Extending the traditional National Income Accounts to include
imputed returns to government capital and consumer durables while treating
government net investment and durables purchases as saving indicate that the

while that devoted to net saving has fallen sharply in the period 1951-85.
The private consumption rate has risen from 63% to 69% over this period
while the government consumption rate has fallen slightly;

7. The inclusion of consumer durables and government tangible
investment raises the national saving rate substantially. In 1985, the
gross and net saving rates rise from a traditionally measured 13.8% and 3.2%
to 24.5% and 8.8%, respectively (about one and a half percentage points of
this increase is due to our different depreciation methodology).
Thus, the data presented in this paper reveal much about the post-war
fiscal history of the United States. In addition to their importance in
understanding trends in national wealth, they may also prove important
inputs into future studies of the long-term growth of the economy and to the
short-run effects of fiscal policy.

Introduction
In all countries, the public sector owns substantial amounts of

capital. Governments also invest as well as consume and make transfer

payments. Government capital, like private capital, also depreciates. Most
advanced countries attempt to incorporate this information, however
imperfectly, in their formal budget documents, by generating separate

capital and current accounts. The United States federal government is the
most conspicuous exception.
Government capital formation raises a number of issues important to

national economic well-being. For example, net capital formation may be
a major component of net national saving or dissaving. It may be more
appropriate to finance government capital formation than government

consumption by borrowing rather than taxing. Some types of government
capital formation are complementary to private activity and enhance

productivity, but government investments do not have to meet the same

kind of market test as private investment) We do not have an
analogue to the stock market to value it. Thus, measures of government
capital and investment may be particularly useful information which
cannot be inferred from other data.

Measuring government capital raises difficult conceptual issues (see,

for example, Eisner and Nebhut (1982)). Among these are the definition of

1. The theory of local public goods suggests there may be at least a partial
market test for site-specific investments.

1

what is government versus private product, and what is capital.2 Another
set of questions concerns whether to include and how to measure, government
human capital investment.3

2. Various government sponsored enterprises which are, at least nominally,
private, also maintain a specific line of credit at the Treasury. Still
more subtle is the treatment of mandated private activity. While the
economic "rules of the game", establishing property rights and the like, are
made by the government, in advanced economies, governments have increasingly
required the private sector to engage in various activities and provide
various types of benefits. For example, when pollution and safety control
equipment are mandated by law for automobiles, regardless of whether the
activity mandated passes social cost-benefit tests, the expenditures are
counted as part of gross private auto sales, although they are close
substitutes for the government levying a tax and paying the automobile
companies to install them. Various recent proposals would require employers
to pay for health insurance coverage for all employees. Quite aside from
the impacts this might have on wages and/or employment, it would be
considered as private compensation of employees in the data, not government
taxes and spending.
A related issue is what to do about uncompensated or below market
compensation services "purchased" by the government. For example, a
military draft presumably enables the government to hire military personnel
at below market wage rates (see Eisner and Nebhut (1982) for estimates of
these uncompensated services in the 25 years after World War II). This
issue is not confined to the government but extends to the private sector as
well. For example, substantial uncompensated volunteer time is given by
millions of Americans every year to various charitable causes. This often
enables the free or below market price dispensation of various services, and
hence, the size of this product is underestimated in the National Income
Accounts. We do not propose magic answers to these problems, but only raise
difficult questions and applaud those who have sought to assign plausible
O_

Another important distinction is between consumption and investment
expenditures. Again, accounting rules and various conventions in the
private sector make even the traditional private sector data somewhat
suspect. In the booming microelectronics and software industries, much of
what an economist might think of as investment -- a purchase made to enhance
future earnings - - becomes totally obsolete before the three year period
elapses which distinguishes investment from consumption expenditures.
3. The government spends substantial amounts on education and health -- as does
the private sector -- and other forms of spending which may include a
substantial human capital component. How much of this is investment versus
consumption? Various recent studies have attempted to ascertain this human
capital component for both the private and government sector (see Kendrick
(1976) and Eisner and Nebhut (1982)). Certainly the expenditures are quite

2

Still, separating out capital and current expenditures, and generating
sensible measures of depreciation and net investment can be important inputs

into various kinds of economic analyses. It would enable us to provide a
more accurate picture of how government is using the funds that it raises.

It could help develop better measures of productivity and capital. It can
improve our understanding of fiscal history and highlight emerging fiscal

issues, such as the alleged deterioration of the infrastructure. It may be

useful in explaining private consumption and saving (Boskin (1986a)). Most
important from the standpoint of this paper, it is a necessary input into
comprehensive measures of net national saving and national wealth and into
government balance sheets.

One purpose of this paper is to provide estimates of various types

of government investment, depreciation, and capital. Our major
innovations lie in the estimates of depreciation of fixed reproducible
capital, the value of government land, and the value of government
mineral rights.
We then use these series, and corresponding ones for the private
sector, to obtain values for government consumption and net worth and to
adjust GNP, NNP, and national saving and investment figures from the

National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA). Thus, we seek to complement
previous studies attempting to extend measures of national income and

large, and if all such expenditures are included, gross investment in human
capital is about as large as gross investment in tangible capital. But not
all of the expenditures is investment; and of course, the stock of such
capital depreciates and obsolesces.

product to a more comprehensive treatment of the government sector (such as
Eisner and Nebhut (1982), Goldsmith (1962, 1982), Martin, Landefeld and
Peskin (1982), Kendrick (1976), Eisner and Pieper (1984), and Eisner
(1986)).

We focus on a particular subset of improvements to the NIPAs and

previous studies while ignoring others. For example, we do not examine
mandated private activity or uncompensated or undercompensated services;

nor do we examine human capital expenditures. This is not because we
consider these issues unimportant; it is to allow us to focus on others.

Even with this deliberately narrow focus, our estimates of gross and net
national product extended to include the return to government capital

substantially exceed the traditional numbers. Our estimates of the combined
state-local and federal government capital stock are a large fraction of the

analogously computed private capital stock. Government net saving, defined
as revenues less consumption rather than by the traditional budget surplus
or deficit figures (in accord with the OECD and United Nations system of
national accounts for other countries) and government net capital formation

are substantial. They also vary over time and can be important components
of net national saving and net national investment.

The paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses fixed
reproducible capital --

the

methodology, concerns with the traditional

estimates of the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and various estimates and
trends of fixed reproducible capital of the federal and state-local

governments in the United States. Importantly, it provides estimates based
on depreciation assumptions which are consistent with empirical estimates

for the private sector. The depreciation estimates generate internally
consistent capital stock and imputed rent series. It also presents
consistent real net revaluation estimates.

4

Section 3 discusses government inventories, presents data on inventory
values including military and non-military as well as a breakdown by level
of government, and compares inventory investment with fixed reproducible

investment. It also discusses real revaluations for inventories.
In Section 4, we provide comparisons of these estimates of government
investment and capital stocks to estimates of net investment and capital

stocks in the private sector. We update through 1985 and expand to consumer
durables and residential capital the estimates of Hulten and Wykoff (1981).

We also compare government and private capital stocks using consistent
depreciation assumptions, although they may be controversial ones.

Section 5 presents revised saving, investment and consumption as well

as adjusted GNP and NNP estimates. In addition to imputing the rental flow
from government capital as current consumption, developing improved

estimates of depreciation to estimate net investment and the accrued capital
stock, we also make corresponding adjustments for consumer durables

purchases. These are substantial in the United States and substantially
exceed the depreciation of the durables and hence contribute an important
component to national capital formation (see Boskin and Roberts (1986) for
an elaboration of the importance such adjustments can make in international

comparisons (e.g., with Japan)). The data reveal interesting patterns of
government consumption, saving and net investment. The government sector,
federal and even more importantly state and local, are major contributors to

national capital formation, and their patterns of capital formation have
differed substantially over time and relative to the private sector.

Financial assets and conventional liabilities are discussed in Section
6.

It presents the real market values of federal and state and local

financial assets and liabilities. It updates and makes minor changes to

5

the work of Eisner and Pieper (1984) and Eisner (1986), which draw on the

work of Seater (1981) and Cox and Hirschorn (1983). In addition to the
tangible assets, government units also have substantial financial assets,

as well as the traditional liabilities which have drawn so much recent
attention.

Section 7 updates and corrects estimates of the value of federal
mineral rights developed by Boskin, Robinson, O'Reilly and Kumar (1985) and
extends the analysis - -

albeit

based on scanty data -

- to

state and local

mineral rights. The value of these rights is quite large and fluctuates
substantially as one might suppose given the substantial flucuation in the

prices of minerals. In some years the change in the value of mineral rights
exceeds the conventionally measured budget deficit.

Section 8 discusses the value of federal and state-local ownership

of land. Again, this extends the analysis in Boskin, Robinson, O'Reilly
and Kumar (1985) to the last several years and to the state and local

sector. Various methodological issues are discussed. Governments own a
substantial fraction of the total acreage of land in the United States,
and a modest fraction of the total value of land.

Section 9 is concerned with contingent liabilities such as loan

guarantees, deposit insurance and government pension liabilities. We do not
provide systematic time series on the value of these contingent liabilities,

but discuss the conceptual issues in valuing them, and some data on the

outstanding value of loans, guarantees and insured deposits. The economic
consequences of subsidized loans or loan guarantees depend heavily upon
one's view of credit markets, especially the supply of funds to them (see

Gale (1987)). Various issues are discussed in defining a sensible estimate
of the expected present value of the contingent liabilities flowing from new
commitments of subsidized loans and guarantees and deposit insurance.

6

Section 10 discusses the most important set of potential government
liabilities, the unfunded liabilities in social security and government

pension plans. We refer the reader to other sources for time series on
these data, but discuss a variety of issues surrounding these unfunded
liabilities, their sensitivity to various economic and demographic
assumptions, as well as to political decisions, and highlight some key
recent events in the system.

In Section 11, we present a preliminary attempt to develop a balance

sheet for the government sector of the U.S. economy. After discussing the
advantages and numerous limitations of our estimates, and government net
worth calculations in general, we present balance sheets for federal and

state-local governments for selected years. The trends, particularly in
federal "net worth", are sometimes dramatic. Looking at tangible and
financial assets and conventional liabilities, the federal government had a
net worth (in 1985 dollars) of over $1.0 trillion in 1980, substantially
higher than in 1970, but had lost two-thirds of it by 1985.
A brief conclusion summarizes the results and emphasizes the large

number of caveats we have had to invoke along the way. It also suggests
various avenues for future research.

2.

Fixed Reproducible Capital
Goldsmith (1962) and Kendrick (1976) both estimated the government

capital stock as part of their pioneering studies of national wealth. The
most recent and comprehensive estimates of fixed reproducible government

7

capital stocks have been made by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.4 All
three studies use the perpetual inventory method to calculate net capital
stocks: gross investment is cumulated and estimated accumulated

depreciation is subtracted. Our estimates use the BEA's gross investment
series and most of their service life assumptions, but we adopt a different
depreciation method.

The BEA assumes straight-line depreciation over the estimated economic

service life of each asset.5 However, within each category of
structure or equipment, the BEA allows for a distribution in service lives

around the mean, reflecting a retirement distribution.6 Since the assets
with the shortest assumed lives are retired first, the depreciation rate
for any category of investment slows down once retirements start to occur.

The resulting overall depreciation pattern resembles a geometric decay.
The straight-line assumption made by the BEA is basically arbitrary.

A more satisfactory approach to estimating economic depreciation makes use

of the observed sales prices of used assets. For the private sector,
Hulten and Wykoff (1981) collected data on used asset price from several
sources, weighted these price by estimated survival probabilities to
account for discarded assets, and estimated the form and rate of economic

depreciation. They used a functional form which included all the common

4. Musgrave (1980,1986) and Bureau of Economic Analysis (1982).
5. See BEA (1982) and Musgrave (1980) for more details on the BEA
methodologies.
6. A bell-shaped Winfrey S-3 retirement distribution is used to assign service
lives ranging from 45% to 155% of the mean service life for each category.

8

assumptions --

geometric,

linear, or one-hoss-shay -- as special cases.

Although none of the common forms was accepted statistically, the estimated
price-age profiles were found to be close to geometric for the classes of
assets considered.7 The authors then estimated the constant depreciation
rate which provided the best fit.
These results were used to derive depreciation rates for the types of
producers' durables and nonresidential structures defined in the NIPAs.

There was sufficient data to estimate some types directly. The

declining-

balance rates, R, found for these categories were used to infer depreciation
rates, 6, for the remainder from the definition S =

R/T, where T equals the

BEA estimated service life. The average R value for four equipment
categories was 1.65, so depreciation rates for other equipment classes were
calculated as 6 =

l.65/T.

The average R value for two types of structures

was 0.91, so depreciation rates assigned to other types of structures were S
0.91/T.

The Hulten-Wykoff depreciation rates are consistent with the
observations of Young and Musgrave (1980) and Hulten and Wykoff (1981)

summarizing earlier studies: equipment depreciates faster than straight-line

in the early years, while structures depreciate more slowly. These
depreciation rates are certainly significant topics for future research, but
we feel that the Hulten Wykoff depreciation estimates are the best

7. Hulten and Wykoff (1981) state that "the age-price profiles estimated using
the Box-Cox model were very close, on average, to being geometric in form."
(p.93) The eight NIPA asset categories for which depreciation rates were
calculated directly as averages of rates for the assets they study were
tractors, contruction machinery, metalworking machinery, general industrial
equipment, trucks, autos, industrial buildings and commercial buildings.

9

available.8
In addition to fitting the used asset price data more closely, the
geometric depreciation assumption has important theoretical advantages.9
The depreciation methods and measures used in the national income accounts,
the BEA capital stock series, the important work of Denison (1957, 1962,

1967, 1972, 1974, 1979 and 1985), Kendrick (1973) and studies using the NIPA

and/or BEA capital stock data are internally inconsistent. The measures of
capital must employ the same pattern of relative differences of capital

goods of different vintages for both capital stocks and rental prices. As
pointed out originally by Jorgenson and Griliches (1972), the depreciation
patterns assumed in these studies cannot be used both to impute the rental
prices and measure the capital stocks against which the rental prices are

applied to measure imputed rent, gross or net.1° The principal disadvantage
of geometric depreciation is that retirement never occurs. Of course, all
simple depreciation formulae assume that depreciation is constant over time
and across assets within a category.

Given the empirical evidence and theoretical advantages, we assume

that fixed government capital depreciates geometrically. Lacking evidence

8. See Hulten and Wykoff (1981), DeLeeuw (1981), Taubman (1981) and Boskin,
Robinson, and Roberts (1986), for further discussion of the strengths and
weakness of the estimates and the used-asset-price approach.

9. See Boskin, Robinson, and Huber (1987) for additional discussion of the
theoretical issues.
10. See Jorgenson (1986) for further discussion of this point.

10

on prices for used government assets,11 we use the market evidence on used
private assets gathered by Hulten and Wykoff; that is, the depreciation
rate for government equipment is l.65/(service life) and that for each type

of structure is O.91/(service life). With one exception, the BEA estimated
service lives for the various types of government capital are used to infer
depreciation rates.

12

Our estimates of the net investment and net stock of government fixed

reproducible capital in 1985 dollars are shown in Table 1. We give our
separate estimates for federal and state and local governments in Table 2.
Both tables give the corresponding estimates for the BEA, updated by us to
1985 dollars.13

11. For some categories, such as military equipment, there are no private
analogs and little or no secondary market. Even for government assets
comparable to private categories, depreciation may be systematically
different, due, for example, to differences in maintenance. Any
adjustments to depreciation rate would be quite arbitrary, however, without
more information.
12. Based on several studies (Jack Faucett Associates Inc. (1974), Kendrick
(1976)) which estimate or assume a shorter service life than the BEA, we
assume a 40 year service life for highways and streets, instead of the
BEA's 60 year life.
13. The BEA 1982 dollar estimates were updated by the price indices used by the
BEA to derive its current and constant dollar estimates. These price
indices are implicit in the BRA current and constant cost net capital
stock, investment and depreciation data, as found in the 1986 BRA wealth
data tape. Separate indices are used for each asset type and values differ
slightly for stocks (end of year) and flows (yearly average).
Thus, we converted the constant cost net capital stock estimates from
1982 to 1985 dollars for each BEA asset category by multiplying the 1982
dollar net capital stock series by the ratio of the 1985 BRA current cost
net capital stock to the BEA constant cost (1982$) net capital stock.
Similarly, we multiplied the corresponding investment and depreciation
flows by the ratio of 1985 current cost depreciation to 1985 constant cost
depreciation (1982$). This reflects the BEA's use of an end of the year
price index for stocks and a yearly average price index for investment and
depreciation flows.

We estimate that the net government fixed reproducible capital stock
exceeds $2.7 trillion dollars, having more than doubled in real terms since

World War II. As can be seen in Figure 1, the broad trends of our
estimates are consistent with those of the BEA, which is not surprising
since we use their gross investment data and most of their service lives.

Nevertheless, there are important differences between the two series
regarding both the level and postwar growth of the government capital

stock. Our 1985 estimate is 19% higher than that of the BEA, while at the
end of World War II our value was 8% lower.14 The BEA's estimate of the
postwar growth in net government capital is more than 40% below ours.

With the exception of World War II, state and local government capital
stocks have been larger than those of the federal government, as shown in

Figure 2. Currently, state and local governments own 69% of total
government fixed reproducible capital. Except during military buildups,
state and local governments provide an even larger fraction of total

government investment, as can be seen in Figure 3. The surges in federal
investment roughly coincide with World War II, the Korean and Vietnam Wars
and the Reagan defense buildup.

We attempted to reproduce the BEA estimates from the gross investment
and service life data. We exactly succeeded for several categories, but
were slightly off on others. We believe the differences result from our
incomplete data on BEA adjustments for intersectoral transfers. To correct
for this and other possible statistical discrepancies, we subtracted the
excess of our straight-line estimates over the BEA's from our BRH
estimates.
14. The different trend is due to the smaller share of equipment in government
investment in the postwar years. See Boskin, Robinson, and Roberts (1986)
and Boskin, Robinson, and Huber (1987) for further discussion and detailed
estimates.

The behavior of the various components of federal and state and local
investment and capital sheds light on several policy debates, though we can

only touch on them in this paper. Figure 4 pictures the division of
aggregate federal net investment between military and non-military. For a
twenty-five year period beginning in 1954, the military and non-military
series track fairly closely, with non-military investment usually slightly

larger. Starting in 1979, however, the two series diverge, as military net
investment has reached record postwar levels while civilian investment has
dropped.

In Figure 5, we divide net state and local investment into three major

categories: educational buildings, highways, and other. The "other"
category is primarily other types of structures; equipment is less than 5%

of the net state and local stock. The three components have a similar
pattern: after disinvestment during World War II, all three reach peaks in

the late l960s and drop to troughs in the recent recession. The observed
pattern of aggregate net investment, therefore cannot be attributed solely
to the baby boom or the construction of the interstate highway system.

The

substantial levels of net investment in the highway and other categories,

even in recessions, casts doubt on reports of a deteriorating
infrastructure 15

15. Much of the worry about the infrastructure, however, concerns deferred
maintenance. As Hulten and Peterson (1984) point out, maintenance is not
counted as investment. If governments spend less on maintenance than the
private sector, our depreciation estimates may be too low, Of course, we
are also considering the entire state and local sector. The infrastructure
may well be deteriorating in some areas while substantial investment goes
on elsewhere.

Real Revaluations of Tangible Fixed Reproducible Capital
The data discussed above and presented in Tables 1 and 2 do not include
net revaluations for tangible reproducible capital due to changes in capital

goods prices relative to the general price level. They deflate current
dollar figures by the BEA implicit deflators for each type of capital.
Because real revaluations can be substantial (see Eisner (1980)), we present

data on real revaluations (in constant 1985 dollars) of federal and

state-local tangible fixed reproducible capital in Table 3. Real net
revaluations are defined as the change in the value of capital minus real
net investment and minus the change in the value of capital which would just

compensate for changes in the general price level. Thus, real net
investment (calculated from the specific implicit price deflators for
investment goods) plus real net revaluations plus the real capital stock in
period t-l equals the real capital stock in period t (where the real capital
stocks are just the current cost series as deflated by the repective end-of-

year CNP deflator))6
As Table 3 reveals, both the federal and state-local sector have
experienced substantial real capital gains and losses on their corresponding

fixed capital stocks. The net revaluations were generally negative in the
l950s and l960s, positive in the l970s, and negative in the 1980s. While
real revaluations are substantial in absolute dollars and relative to net

16. We have scaled the CNP deflator to equal 1.0 at the end of 1985. Eisner's
(1980) definition of real net revaluations seems to be identical to ours.
However, he deflates slightly differently. We believe our method coresponds
more closely to the definition.

investment, they are modest relative to the capital stock. For example, the
$170 billion and $32 billion real revaluations of state-local and federal
capital stocks for 1974 amount to about 10% and 5% of the corresponding
stocks, but were much larger than net investment.

These large real capital

gains were offset the following year by real losses approximately one-half

as large. Indeed, cumulating the combined state-local and federal net
revaluations from 1948-85 yields a total of about $160 billion, or 6% of the
estimated 1985 real net stock excluding revaluatjons.

Thus, while the year-

to-year fluctuations are important, the overall cumulative real wealth

effect of revaluations has been quite modest, as is evident from Figure 1.
In principle, one would add real net revaluations to real net investment to

obtain total net capital formation for each year. Since we often wish to
compare gross or net investment spending with borrowing, we adopt the

procedure here of separate presentations of real revaluations, but do
include the values adjusted for revaluations in the balance sheets in
Section 11.

3. Government Inventories

The focus of the previous section

was on government equipment and

structures, but inventories are an important part of government
reproducible capital, at least at the federal level.

Table 4 presents

estimates of inventory stocks and investment for both the federal

government and the government sector. These are unpublished BEA series

Government inventories are substantial, exceeding $200 billion dollars
in 1985, finally surpassing the World War II peak. Almost all the
inventories are held by the federal government; for most years, state and

local governments had less than 1% of the total. Figure 6 illustrates that
most of these federal inventories are military, such as munitions. Not
surprisingly, military inventories are quite volatile.

Non-military inventories have grown, however, from 5% of the stock in

1945 to almost 40% in 1985. A further breakdown of non-military
inventories reveals that, in 1982, more than half were strategic stockpiles
of minerals, nuclear materials, helium and oil (the Strategic Petroleum

Reserve))8 More than two-thirds of the remaining non-military inventories
were surplus crops.

Real inventory stocks declined steadily from 1954 through 1980. Since
then, inventory investment has taken off, reaching $33 billion in 1985.

Inventory changes have a large effect on the level of net federal

investment in reproducible capital, as shown in Figure 7. Net federal
investment in structures and equipment has been positive every year since

1950, according to our estimates. When inventories are added in, however,

17. The data were kindly provided to us by John Musgrave. We are also grateful
to Paul Pieper for his assistance. The BEA 1982 constant dollar estimates
of federal government military and nonmilitary, and state and local
government, inventories were each updated to constant 1985 dollars by
multiplying by the ratio of the 1985 BEA current dollar stock to the 1985
constant (1982) dollar stock for each type. Inventory investment was then
calculated as the change in net stock from the previous year.
18. This breakdown was provided to us by Paul Pieper, based on BEA data.

net federal investment becomes negative in 5 of the last 35 years. When
inventories increase, as in the '80s, the impact is also large: more than
half of our estimated $64 billion in net federal investment in 1985 is
inventory investment.

Real Inventory Revaluations
As with fixed reproducible capital, real net revaluations may occur for

government inventories. Table 4 includes a column on estimated real
inventory revaluations defined analogously to that for the fixed

reproducible capital stock. These data reveal that capital losses on
inventories occurred in every year except 1953-55 and 1972-80.

Cumulatively, the total real capital loss was approximately $70 billion,
about one-third quarter of the value of the net stock excluding
revaluations.

4. Comparisons with Private Capital
One of the purposes of this paper is to present more comprehensive

measures of national product and investment. While we concentrate on
government capital, consistency requires adjustments to private capital

measures as well, These adjustments also allow a more accurate comparison
between private capital and investment and our estimates for the government
sector.

Our measures differ from the NIPAs in the treatment of consumer

17

durables and in our depreciation assumptions. As many have noted,19
expenditures on consumer durables should be treated as investment, while an
imputed service flow from these assets should be added to consumption.

Accordingly, we add expenditures on consumer durables to gross private
domestic investment.

In order to determine private capital stock and net investment,

depreciation assumptions must be made. For the various classes of
structures and equipment, we generally use the constant depreciation rates

which were estimated and imputed by Hulten and Wykoff (1981).20 For
those categories whose service lives, as estimated by the BEA, changed, we
imputed depreciation rates using the formulas described in section 2.

For

residential structures, we assumed a depreciation rate of 0.91/(service
life) for the various components, as with most other categories of

structures. For consumer durables other than vehicles, we followed
Christensen and Jorgenson (1973) in assuming double-declining balance

depreciation and we used the BEA's estimated service lives for the various

components.21 For vehicles, we took the depreciation rates for the
corresponding business categories estimated by Hulten and Wykoff.

19. See Katz (1983) for a review of the literature on valuing the services of
consumer durables.

20. Hulten and Wykoff only applied their rates through 1974. Recent work by
Hulten, Robertson, and Wykoff (1986) suggests that depreciation did not
shift substantially after the oil shocks. Hulten and Wykoff did not
attempt to find a depreciation rate for residential capital, either.
21. The BEA methodology is described in Musgrave (1979). Kendrick (1976) also
used double-declining balance for non-vehicle consumer durables. See Katz
(1983) for a discussion of alternative depreciation assumptions for
consumer durables.

18

Our estimates of the various components of the private capital stock

are presented for selected years in 1985 dollars in Table 5. Our value for
the total private capital stock in 1985 is $11.0 trillion, which is 16%
above that of the BEA.22

Regardless of whether one takes our estimates or those of the BEA, the
government sector clearly owns a large fraction of our national capital

stock. As shown in Figure 8 and Table 5, total government tangible capital
is 27% of the size of the private capital stock and is 55% as large as the

stock of private nonresidential structures, equipment, and inventories. A
comparison of government and private net investment is made in Figure 9.

Government investment is much less cyclical than private investment and
actually exceeded total private nonresidential investment in 1982.

Saving and Investment

The discussion above highlights the size of the government capital

stock and investment. Governments create a large share of the national
capital formation, and the failure to include the imputed return on
government capital seriously distorts measures of total consumption and

income. The inappropriate treatment of consumer durables also distorts our
understanding of investment, income, and consumption. These issues are

22. Our depreciation estimates for residential and nonresidential structures
are significantly lower than the BEA's, while our estimates of the
depreciation of consumer durables are much higher.

well-known (see, for example, David and Scadding (1974), Eisner and Nebhut

(1982), Kendrick (1976), and Holloway (1987)). In this section, we present
estimates of GNP and NNP

including

imputed rent to durables and government

capital, and adjusted estimates of government and private consumption,

saving and investment rates. The advantages of the work reported here,
relative to earlier studies, include the following:

(1) The estimates of government and private depreciation are
consistent with the best available empirical evidence.
(2) The depreciation assumptions are internally consistent, i.e., the

estimates of rental prices of capital services are consistent with the

corresponding estimates of capital stock. Unfortunately, the depreciation
estimates of the BEA capital stock series and those used in the national
income accounts are based on an internally inconsistent set of estimates of
depreciation, stemming from an important paper presented at a previous NBER

Conference on Income and Wealth by Denison (1957). Jorgenson and Griliches
(1972) pointed out long ago that the Denison/NIPA approach to estimating
depreciation is consistent with the basic economic concept of depreciation
only if the relative efficiencies of capital of different ages decline
geometrically.

(3) We impute a constant 3% real rate of return net of depreciation and

maintenance to government capital and consumer durables. Given the
illiquidity of most government capital and consumer durables, it is unlikely
that the service flow from these assets fluctuates with any short-term

variation in the real interest rate. A sensitivity analysis showed only

20

very minor changes to variations in the assumed real interest rate.23
(4) We include an imputed return for government land.

Table 6 presents a reconciliation for 1985 of GNP, NNP, private
consumption, saving and investment, and government consumption, saving and

investment based on the adjustments we have made. While real net
revaluations might be included in net saving and investment, we do not do so

here. First, these estimates are more readily comparable to the traditional
figures. Second, we may wish to compare direct investment spending with
various variables, not presuming revaluations were being forecast and used

in decision-making. Further, they are more important for year-to-year
variation than cumulatively. Finally, we often compare saving or investment
to government borrowing. In the sections which follow we develop more
comprehensive measures of changes in real assets and liabilities. One might

23. Martin, Landefeld and Peskin (1982) consider several methods for calculating
the value of services of government capital net of depreciation. The
current-cost framework values all vintages of capital at current prices and
interest rates. This method would be appropriate if we were using a market
value of government capital as set, for example, in a stock market, since
the market would demand the same rate of return on all capital of similar
risk. With our cost-base capital estimates, such a measure would overstate
fluctuations as interest rates change.
A second method used by Martin, Landefeld and Peskin is a vintage
framework, where investment in any year is assumed to meet a cost-beneift
test with an interest rate appropriate to the year. They use a five-year
average of nominal interest rates as their proxy for the discount rate used
at the time of investment. It seems unlikely, however, that investment
decisions vary with fluctuations in interest rates, particularly nominal
rates. When inflation rates change, using nominal rates means that the real
value of services would vary for the existing capital.
We prefer their third method of assuming a constant real rate of
return. Martin, Landefeld, and Peskin use a 7% real rate, but we believe
that is probably above the rate of return actually achieved on government
capital. Hence, we use a 3% real rate. The calculations, particularly of
saving rates, are quite insensitive to the constant real rate chosen.

Notes:

1Rent equals opportunity cost plus depreciation. We assume a constant real
interest rate of 3% in calculating opportunity cost for government capital
and consumer durables. We apply this discount rate to midyear stocks for
year t obtained by averaging the end of year stocks for years t and t-l.
Because the return on government enterprise capital is, at least in theory,
already included in GNP, we do not include imputed rent on government
enterprise capital in our expanded measures of government consumption and
GNP. See Martin, Landefeld, and Peskin (1982) for further discussion. All
depreciation estimates used in the adjusted calculations are the authors'
as described in Sections 2 and 4.
2This entry includes private equipment and nonresidential and residential
structures. Consumer durables are listed separately. Inventories are
assumed not to depreciate. The adjusted estimate is from the authors'
calculations while the "traditional" entry is the NIPA capital consumption
allowance.
3In the adjusted calculations gross investment data for fixed reproducible
capital and consumer durables is from the 1986 BEA Wealth Data Tape, with
our conversion to 1985 dollars based on BEA price indices. These series
differ slightly from the NIPA series from which they are derived, because
of adjustments for intersectoral transfers, for instance. Most of the
difference between the gross private investment series presented here is in
equipment. Government inventory investment is measured as the change in
year-end stocks, based on BEA data converted to 1985 dollars. Government
gross investment in land is based on estimates of yearly net acquisitions
(see Section 8 for a discussion of our land estimates) and does not include
revaluat ions.

well wish to compare, for example, government investment with the change in
real net debt (the changes in the real value of financial liabilities in
excess of financial assets) or even with an estimate of real "net worth".

Again, we adopt the more conventional comparisons in this section, leaving

the discussion of these other adjustments to subsequent sections. As can be
seen, including the gross rent on government capital and consumer durables
increases GNP by more than 10%, while including net rent and using our
estimates of depreciation increases NNP by about 4%.

Government consumption likewise is slightly different from government
purchases of goods and services as the rent on government capital was about

$20 billion smaller than government gross investment. Private consumption,
however, is quite close to NIPA personal consumption expenditures, as the
estimated rental flow of services from the stock of consumer durables in

1985 (but not in general) is close to gross investment in durables. To
total gross investment, we add approximately $190 billion of government

investment and almost $350 billion of consumer durable investment. Thus,
total gross investment is almost 80% larger than gross private investment as

traditionally reported in the NIPA. Using our depreciation estimates, both
for traditional private investment and for government capital and consumer
durables, yields adjusted net national investment of $406 billion, also 80%
larger than the NIPA figures.

Turning to saving, gross saving substantially exceeds NIPA gross

private saving, about $1.1 trillion compared to $551 billion. NIPA net
saving of $114 billion is only about one-third of our adjusted net saving.

Corresponding differences would be found in saving, investment, and
consumption rates, although recall that NNP and GNP are slightly larger
than the NIPA figures, so the proportionate increases would be slightly

less. Table 7 presents estimates of U.S. saving and investment from

1951 to 1985, using our adjusted accounts, as percentages of adjusted

gross national product. For the three decades from 1951 to 1980, we
present simple averages of annual figures for the decade.24
The data reveal some interesting trends in total net saving and total

net investment in the United States. Total net saving, while substantially
higher than the traditional NIPA figures, has declined substantially

relative to the 1950s and l960s. It declined about 15% between the 1950s
and 1960s on the one hand, and the 1970s on the other, and has deteriorated

markedly in the 1980s. By 1985, the third year of an expansion, the total
net saving rate, expanded to include government saving and saving in the
form of consumer durables, was almost 40% below the average for the 1950s

and 1960s. Net private saving (also substantially larger than the
corresponding NIPA figures because of the inclusion of net saving in

consumer durables) was only slightly below historical levels in 1984-5. Net
government saving, however, which averages a substantial fraction of GNP in
the 1950s and l960s, and a modest fraction in the 1970s, turned negative
from 1982 to 1985.

Federal government net saving turned sharply negative, and more than

offset state-local government saving. Note here that saving is defined to
adjust the traditional surplus or deficit figures for net investment. It is
interesting to note, for example, that while the federal government borrowed
4.4% of adjusted GNP in 1985, federal government net investment was

24. While we have alternative estimates based on different combinations of
deflators of the various components, the estimates reported here for
comparability with the traditional national income accounts are
presented as current dollar estimates for the corresponding period. The
corresponding constant dollar figures are similar, but show a smaller
rise in private consumption and fall in government consumption.

23

estimated as 1.4% of GNP, about one-third of the deficit figure. Whether
the value of these assets the federal government was accumulating is

properly measured by purchase price and should be thought of as representing
a substantial available set of public assets to offset the growing public
liabilities represented by the deficits is a question we do not address
here.

The state-local government sector has always been a large net saver.
In the period 1951-80, this was primarily because of net investment, for

example, in educational buildings. In the l980s, the pattern has changed.
Net investment by state-local governments has fallen to one-third of its

earlier historical level, perhaps desirably so in view of changing

demographics. Counteracting this has been the swing to a very substantial
state-local surplus, although the latter is heavily concentrated in pension
plans, whose simultaneously accruing liabilities are not accounted for in
these data.

Net investment in the United States has been more stable than national

saving. Domestic investment was actually a higher fraction of national
product in the '70s than in the '60s. The net domestic investment rate in
1984-85 was only 14% below its level from 1951-80, compared with a 32% drop

in net saving rates. Making up for much of the savings decline of course,
has been the substantial decline in net foreign investment (due both to a
decrease in U.S. investment abroad and an increase in foreign investment in

the U.S.), the other side of the trade deficit. Over 20% of domestic
investment was financed from abroad in 1984-85.

Government net investment in 1985 was about at the same ratio of
national income as over the previous three decades, although state-local

government net investment had fallen substantially. Federal government net

24

investment heavily reflects the military buildup; in 1985, federal
investment was at a level not attained since the 1950s.

It is worth mentioning that gross saving and investment rates were in
the low to mid twenty percent range with the expanded definitions, with
total capital consumption having risen from fifteen to sixteen percent in
the 1951-80 period to seventeen to eighteen percent in the 1980s. Two-thirds
of the difference between the net saving rates in the '60s and '80s is
attributable to an increased rate of capital consumption. A similar rise is
reported in NIPA, but the gross saving, gross investment, and depreciation
figures are all substantially higher under the expanded definitions.

We present, in Table 8, estimates of gross and net saving rates on

various adjusted bases. We start with the traditional NIPA basis, show the
rates on an OECD basis (including government non-military investment, but
neither government military investment nor consumer durables), and move to

broader definitions. While the trends in these rates are important, perhaps
at least as important is the fact that traditional comparisons between the
United States and other countries are marred by numerous comparability
problems, among the most important of which is the differential role played
by government relative to private capital formation and net investment,
especially military investment, on the one hand, and consumer durable

purchases on the other. These comparisons are particularly misleading with
respect to Japan (see Boskin and Roberts (1986)).

As the data in Table 9 and Figure 10 reveal, private consumption as a
share of NNP has risen from 62.9% in 1950 and 63.7% in 1960 to 69.0% in

1985. This six percentage point rise -- about a 10% increase --

is

close to

the volume of traditional net private saving. Had private consumption
remained at its 1950-60 ratio, and the government sector been unchanged, net
private saving would have been almost doubled in 1985.

Government consumption, as shown in Figure 11, remains about 25% of NNP
throughout the '50s and '60s, but has since declined to only 21.3% by 1985.

This aggregate marks a ten percentage point decline in federal government
consumption since the Korean War (despite the growth of the government

capital stock) and a four percentage point rise in state-local government

consumption. The former heavily reflects the growth of federal transfer
payments (which by the mid 1970s exceeded purchases of goods and services)

and the latter the demographic pressure of the baby boom on government
spending on education.

The share of NNP devoted to national consumption has risen from about

86% in 1950 to over 90% by 1985. Though the consumption ratio has
fluctuated substantially, partly for cyclical reasons, the continued upward
trend is marked.

While the share of national product devoted to consumption has risen,

the government's role in the trend is complex. While direct government
consumption has fallen, part of the increase in the private consumption rate
undoubtedly reflects the incentives created by growing government transfer

payment programs and by tax policies. Thus, the decline in the national
saving rate alluded to earlier reflects both the growth of the private
consumption ratio -

- partly

resulting from government transfer payment

growth -- and the decline in the net saving rate of the government sector --

indeed, its shift to net dissaver - -

resulting

both from historically large

federal deficits and from the decline in state-local government net
investment.

public. Little noticed is that governments also hold substantial
financial assets, as well as off-budget liabilities. Though, as Boskin
(1982) argues, the appropriate definition of deficits depends on the
question being asked, the conventional measures of debt and deficits are
not accurate answers to almost any of them.

The Federal Reserve's Flow of Funds presents balance sheets with
financial assets and liabilities for both the federal and the state and

local governments. As Eisner and Pieper (1984) point out, the Flow of
Funds figures should be adjusted to reflect their market, rather than

the par, value. They make a series of careful adjustments to the
various components on the balance sheet.25 Eisner (1986) updates the
par-to-market conversions and extends them to state and local
governments. The conversion factors are particularly large during
periods of increasing inflation and interest rates, like 1980.26
Financial assets and liabilities in 1985 are presented for both

levels of government in Table 10. We have made only Eisner and Pieper's
par-to-market corrections to the Flow of Funds accounts.27 The federal
government had more than $1 trillion in financial assets. More than half
of these were loans, but there was also more than $140 billion in cash,

time deposits and gold. Conventional debt also understates liabilities,

25. The methodology is described in an appendix to Eisner (1986). Eisner and
Pieper build on work by Seater (1981) and Cox and Hirschhorn (1983).
26. The large interest subsidies received by state and municipal bondholders and
some borrowers from federal agencies might suggest further refinements of
these adjustments if one were willing to contemplate sales of portfolios to
the private sector which continued to carry tax advantages.
27. We are grateful to Paul Pieper for providing us with 1985 par-to-market
indicies.

which include more than $250 billion in agency debt. State and local
government financial assets exceeded $450 billion and were within $100

billion of their financial liabilities. Nearly half of state and local
financial assets were federal government liabilities.
Figures 12 and 13 show the trends in financial assets and liabilities

for the two sectors in 1985 dollars. Federal financial liabilities fell
rapidly after the war, then changed relatively little in real terms through

1981. At the same time, federal financial assets were gradually rising in
real terms. The difference, called by Eisner the net debt, was less than
$600 billion in 1980, only slightly above its postwar low.

In the last few

years, of course, federal liabilities have exploded, and in 1985 they

exceeded the 1945 peak for the first time. Since financial assets grew by
only 10%, the net debt, as shown in Table 11, grew by 145%.
State and local government financial liabilities grew more rapidly

than financial assets through 1971. Liabilities fell sharply in real terms
in the late '70s, while financial assets continued their steady growth, so
that net debt in 1985 was $66 billion, less than one-third its peak.

Government Oil and Gas Mineral Rights

Governments own a large fraction of the mineral rights in the United

States. Federal and state governments own all mineral rights on offshore
and tidal lands. In addition, all levels own the mineral rights under

government land. For consistent accounting, the value of these assets
should be counted as wealth and revenues from government-owned lands should
be charged as sales of the assets.

Oil and gas rights are by far the most valuable to the government
sector, though other minerals, particularly coal, may be more valuable in

some states. For the federal government, we correct, update, and convert to
1985 dollars the estimates of the value of oil and gas rights made by
Boskin, Robinson, O'Reilly, and Kumar (l985).28
When a government leases the mineral rights in a particular area --

rights

essentially to as yet undiscovered resources -

- it has

reduced

its mineral wealth by transferring claims to part of it to the private

sector. In return the government receives some payment immediately in
the form of a bonus, with the rest of the payments deferred as royalties

or rental payments. Bonuses are cash payments that are not conditional
on the existence or size of the resource, and are typically the variable

subject to bidding. Royalty payments are fractions, usually fixed in
advance, of the gross revenue of the produced output, if any. By the
time reserves are proven', their only value to the government is the
present value of royalties they represent.29
The method used by BROK takes advantage of several institutional and
theoretical characteristics of oil and gas production to value federal oil

and gas rights with the limited information available.30 The base-year

28. While revising and updating the data, we discovered a programming error
underlying Table 1 of Boskin, Robinson, O'Reilly, and Kumar (BROK). We
correct the series in Table 12. Fortunately, the qualitative conclusions of
BROK are unaffected by the error, but the revised estimates are about onethird lower than in BROK.
29. We shall argue below, however, that severance taxes on the production
should also be counted as royalties.
30. See BROK for a more complete description and discussion of the method.
The following persons provided unpublished data or other assistance with
this section: L. Cordova of the Minerals Management Service, D.
Everitts and H. Gonzalez of the California State Lands Commission, S.
Sharlot of the Texas General Land Office, B. Van Dyke of the Alaska
Division of Oil and Gas, and C. Logsdon of the Alaska Department of
Revenue.

29

value of oil and gas rights to the government is the sum of three
components: future royalties on proven reserves; future royalties on
estimated undiscovered reserves; and future bonuses on unleased land.

Fortunately, royalties are historically fixed percentages of the gross

revenues. Since the percentage is known, forecasting royalties requires
forecasting production and prices. By definition, expected future
production, with current prices and technology, is the sum of proven and

estimated undiscovered reserves. Since oil and gas are exhaustible
resources, there are theoretical, as well as empirical, reasons to expect

increasing real prices. BROK assume that real prices will grow at the real
rate of interest, since this is both convenient and roughly consistent with
historical evidence and theory.

31

Bonuses on unleased land are assumed to

be proportional to royalties on undiscovered resources.

BROK obtain the value of federal oil and gas rights in other years

by making two additional assumptions. First, the quantity of oil and
gas reserves changes only with production.32 Second, the expected
future price path at any date is proportional to actual prices at that

31. Without this assumption, one needs to know the rates of leasing,
discovery, and production of the resources. See BROK for a
justification. We consider alternative assumptions, as did BROK, below.

32. Since the government only receives royalty revenue on oil actually
produced, it seems appropriate for a wealth calculation to use the best
estimate of oil reserves, rather than have reserves fluctuate with
changing geologic predictions. Reserve estimates should change, though,
as prices and technology change. Given the assumption of rising real
prices, however, oil which is not profitable to produce at current
prices will probably become profitable in the future. Even using a
reserve estimate made with high real prices (BROK use 1981 figures) will
probably understate ultimate recovery of oil and gas.

30

date.33 With these assumptions, capital gains or losses are
proportional to price changes and the change in value from year to year
is the capital gain less bonuses and royalties received.

The corrected values of federal oil and gas rights, converted to 1985

dollars using the GNP deflator, are given in Table 12. The magnitudes are
enormous, particularly after the second oil shock. The 1980 value is the
largest of any single asset on the federal balance sheet, substantially

higher than structures, gold, mortgages, or inventories. It is almost as
large as the net federal debt in that year. Even after the dramatic drop in
world oil prices, we estimate the value of federal oil and gas rights

exceeded one-third of a trillion dollars in 1986. As Figure 14 shows,
changes in the value of federal rights can also be large, occasionally

exceeding the conventionally measured budget deficit. Some volatility is
appropriate since the method is designed to give a contemporaneous estimate
of the value of mineral rights.

Before turning to state and local mineral rights, let us add some

caveats. Our calculations are sensitive to estimates of undiscovered,
economically recoverable reserves. As shown in BROK, the value of oil and
gas rights could be up to 39% higher or 29% lower if one took the 5% or 95%

bounds calculated by the U.S. Geological Survey (1981). The estimates are

33. Implicitly, this assumes that oil and gas markets are in equilibrium
each year.

also sensitive to the assumptions on price growth.34
Since state and local governments do not appear, for the most part,
to keep records on either production or reserves on state-owned lands,

it is difficult to make estimates of the value of oil and gas rights for

them. We have obtained information from three states which account for
more than 60% of U.S. oil production and a higher fraction of the value
of state-owned oil and gas rights: Alaska, Texas, and California.35

By far the most valuable oil and gas rights are owned by the state of

Alaska. More than 99% of Alaska's production is on state-owned land; this
compares to an estimated 6.5% for Texas and 1.8% for California.36 Since

essentially all of Alaskas production is on state-owned land, it is
artificial to treat taxes on petroleum differently than royalties. If the
severance tax rate were lower, for example, royalty rates could be raised

by the same amount without changing production or state revenues. Even the
corporate tax on oil companies should be viewed as payment for oil rights;

oil companies pay more than 90% of corporate income taxes and the formula

34. If prices grow more slowly than the interest rate by 1% or 2%, and we
assume that 10% of proven reserves are produced and 3% of undiscovered
reserves are proven each year, the value in 1981 would fall to $494
billion or $383 billion, respectively.
35. Production figures are from U.S. Dept. of Energy (l986a), Petroleum Supply
Outlook, 1985. Except for Alaska, most oil and gas on state land is
underwater. Louisiana is the only significant omission.
36. The figure for Alaska is based on a phone conversation with the state
Department of Revenue (the quoted figure was 99.75%). The California and
Texas percentages are based on niinieo sheets on tttide and submerged lands"
with the Texas figure inferred from royalties, royalty rates, and an
assumed price. No information was available on other state-owned land in
either state.

32

for calculating the base was changed to maximize the take from the oil

producers.37 Accordingly, we include all petroleum taxes and royalties as
part of the value of rights.

In 1985, Alaska's revenues from petroleum were $3.1 billion or $4.64

per barrel produced. Alaska had 7.1 billion barrels of proven oil reserves,
so under the price growth assumption of BROK, these alone were worth at

least $32.9 billion in 1985.38 Alaska was estimated to have 6.9 billion
barrels of undiscovered, economically recoverable oil onshore. If this was
all on state land, the value of oil rights would have been $65 billion in

1985. Finally, the state was estimated to have 71 trillion cubic feet of
natural gas either proven or undiscovered. If the value to the state of
10,000 cubic feet of gas were the same as a barrel of oil, this would make

the total value of Alaskan oil and gas rights $98 billion in l985.
By comparison to Alaska, even Texas looks small. The average royalty
rate on state-owned land was 12% and the severance tax rates were 4.6% for

37. Alaska changed from using a formula based on fraction of investment and
employment in the state to one based on sales when the oil pipeline was
completed. Percentage is calculated using figure is State of Alaska (1986).
38. Actually the figure is even greater, since Alaskan revenue increases more
than proportionally with the world oil price and BROK assume rising oil
prices. In part, this is due to the high transportation cost of Alaskan
oil. The state is currently forecasting revenues of $1.70 per barrel for
fiscal 1987, a drop of 63% from the 1985 figure with only a 44% drop in the
world oil price. This makes calculating the value of oil and gas rights
over time even more difficult.
39. Without a gas pipeline, the value of Alaska's gas is problematical.

33

oil and 7.5% for gas.4° If the reserve-to production ratio is the same on
private and state-owned land, the value of proven reserves of oil and gas

on state land in 1985 was $2.2 billion and $1.6 billion respectively.41 If
state land contains the same fraction of undiscovered reserves as of

production, the total value of Texas's oil and gas rights was roughly $12
billion in 1985.

42

Since California has much smaller proven and estimated undiscovered
reserves, and since the state owns a much smaller fraction of those

reserves, the value of California's rights is lower by an order of

magnitude. The state collects an average royalty of 16.5%. Under the BROK
assumptions, the value of California's oil and gas rights were $0.8 billion
in 1985, if the ratio of both undiscovered and proven reserves to
production was the same on private and state land.

Our estimates of the total value of oil and gas rights in 1985 owned by

the three states for which we have data is $110.8 billion. Using the method
described by BROK, we adjust for royalty and bonus payments and price

changes to create current dollar estimates for earlier years. Converting
the estimate to 1985 dollars using the GNP deflator, we obtain an estimate

40. Royalty rates are based on the average of royalty rates on Relinquishment
Act lands and State Fee lands weighted by the acreage in each category
under lease. Severance tax rates were provided by the U.S. Advisory
Commission on Intergovernmental Relations.
41. Reserve figures are from U.S. Dept. of Energy (l986b).
Production on
state land calculated using royalties, royalty rates, and a $26 per barrel
price for oil and $2.60 per mcf price for gas.

42. Undiscovered reserve estimates were taken, as usual, from U.S. Geological
Survey (1981). Texas figures are approximate, since the regions the
U.S.G.S. used were not contiguous with state boundaries.

34

for state oil and gas rights in 1980 of $125 billion. We wish to stress,
however, that data limitations forced several assumptions about the quantity
and value of oil and gas reserves, both proven and undiscovered, on state

land. In addition, we are limited to three states - omission being Louisiana - -

and,

the

most important

due to a lack of royalty data, to the

1980s. Our 1980 estimate of the value of state oil and gas rights exceeds
our figures for the value of any single category of financial asset on the
state and local balance sheet or the value of state and local residential
structures, equipment and inventories combined.

8.

Government Land
Governmental units own

substantial

amounts of land in the United

States, with the federal government alone holding nearly one-third of the

nation's land area. In this section, we present annual estimates of the

value of federal and state-local land from 1946 to l985. The estimates
for 1946-51 are taken from Goldsmith (1962) and those for 1952-68 are from

Milgram (1973). Our contribution is to update these series from 1969
forward. In doing this we follow Milgram's basic methodology with some
modifications.

43. For a discussion of previous estimates of government land values and
another version of estimates for the federal government, see Boskin,
Robinson, O'Reilly, and Kumar (1985).
The following persons provided unpublished data or other assistance
with this section: Z. Addison of the Federal Housing Administration, R.
Gary of the National Forest Service, B. Daniels of the General Services
Administration, J. Jones of the USDA, and W. Sischel.

35

Unfortunately, the data available on acreage and market values of
government land are incomplete, especially for state and local governments,

and not entirely reliable. Like Goldsmith and Milgram, we use these data to
update estimates made for 1946 by Reeve, et al (1950), and more current and

more rigorously-derived benchmark estimates are desirable. These
limitations restrict the degree of confidence that can be placed in any
estimate of government land values.

The General Services Administration publishes estimates of rural and
urban acreage owned by the federal government and its original acquistion
cost in its annual Suimnary Report of Real Property Owned by the United

States Throughout the World. These data are compiled from detailed
inventory reports submitted by federal agencies. In 1985 the GSA estimated
that the federal government owned 723.0 million acres of rural land and 3.7
million of acres of urban land, which had a total acquisition cost of $12.9

billion. Given the significant share of national wealth accounted for by
land, it is perhaps surprising that there is not a large body of carefully-

derived data on land prices. We construct a price index for federal rural
land that gives equal weight to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
estimated average value of farmland and to stumpage prices paid for timber

harvested in national forests. Our price index for federal urban land is
based on the average site price per square foot of one-family homes

purchased with FHA-insured mortgages. We estimate the value of federal
urban and rural land in each year by applying our price index for each to

36

the corresponding GSA acreage series.44
In Table 13 we present estimates of federal, state-local and total

government land values for 1946-85. We have used the GNP deflator to
convert the estimates drawn from Goldsmith, Milgram, and our calculations

into 1985 dollars. We estimate the value of federal land in 1985 at $231.3
billion, with urban land accounting for more than three-fourths of the

total value despite comprising only 0.5% of total acreage. (See Table 14
for a breakdown of the total federal land stock into rural and urban

components and Figure 15 for a chart of government land values.) The
sizable increase in the federal total from $99.4 billion in 1968 results
from an increase of about 160% in urban acreage, which is far more valuable
than rural land, and from increases in both our land price indices that

exceed the general inflation rate. The real value of federal urban land
more than triples over 1968-85, and most of the increase occurs in 1970-74

and 1979-81. The rural land series primarily reflects price changes, and
it increases gradually until the late l970s and early 1980s before

decreasing sharply. Our 1985 total value estimate is 8% lower than the

44. Although there is a clear upward trend in urban acreage from 1.4 million
acres in 1968 to 3.7 million acres in 1985, the observations for three
years are outliers, i.e., there is a change in the time series of more than
20% which is reversed in the following year. These aberrations are due to
temporary reclassifications of land between the urban and rural categories,
twice in the Department of the Navy and once in the Interior Department.
We have replaced the irregular values for the agencies in these instances
with the average of the previous and following years' values.

Less information is available on land owned by state and local
governments; there are neither estimates of total acreage nor a breakdown

between rural and urban components. Yet the significance of these land
holdings is indicated by Milgram's finding that they were more than three

times as valuable as federal land in 1968. Thus, it is important to update
the previous work on state and local government land also. Here we follow
Milgram's methodology almost exactly, partly because a paucity of data

constrains us from doing otherwise. We construct one price index for
all state-local land which gives equal weight to USDA average farmland
values and to the average site price per square foot of homes purchased

with FHA-insured mortgages. To estimate acquisitions, we use a Census
Bureau data series on state and local governments' "capital outlays for

land and existing structures." Lacking other information, we follow
Milgram in reducing these values by 10% to adjust for both the value of

45. The uncertain nature of government land value estimates is illustratd by
using the same price and acreage data in the slightly different formulas
used by Milgram. The differences in methodology arise in the treatment of
land that has been newly acquired or reclassified as urban or rural.
Milgram uses the change in the GSA acquisition cost series to measure total
net land acquisitions instead of relying on the GSA acreage series and
price data. In contrast to our procedure, Milgram's estimate of total
federal land value does not increase when government land is reclassified
from rural to urban, since the original acquisition cost is unchanged.
There is an increase in the value of urban land that is exactly offset by a
decrease in the value of rural land. These differences cause Milgram's
method to generate much lower estimates of federal land values. The 1985
value for Milgram's method is $133 billion. We prefer our method since
reclassification of land from rural to urban as cities expand reflects
genuine increases in the value of land. However, the large difference in
estimates derived from somewhat different methods suggests that further
research remains a high priority.

existing structures located on these lands that are purchased for
continuing use and for sales of state and local government land, which

are not reported separately in the Governmental Finances data. We use
this net acquisitions series At and our price series P to calculate the
value of state-local land Vt as

Pt-i

Estimated values of state and local government land are found in

column 2 of Table 13. Our 1985 market value is $580.5 billion. As can be
seen in Figure 15, the value of this land grows steadily at a slightly

increasing rate between 1968 and 1981. This reflects real increases in
average land prices and yearly net acquisitions of 1-2% of the stock.

Since 1981 the value of state-local land has decreased a total of 18%, as
a significant decrease in nominal farmland values and a levelling off in
urban land values have caused our composite price index to decrease.

Contingent Liabilities
The federal government and closely allied federally sponsored agencies

engage in activities which generate contingent liabilities (and also

assets) for the government. The most important of these are loans, loan
guarantees, and deposit insurance. The recent developments in real estate,
agriculture, energy, and less developed country loans threaten the solvency
of the two major deposit insurance programs - -

the

Federal Deposit

Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Saving and Loan Insurance

Corporation (FSLIC). The agricultural debt crisis has already brought the
Farm Credit System (FCS), a federally regulated and sponsored financial

intermediary, to Congress for emergency financial relief. Agricultural

39

loan guarantees by the Farm Home Administration (FmHA) are in the process

of major default and substantial federal payouts. Other federal insurance
programs of questionable solvency include the Pension Benefit Guarantee

Corporation (PBGC) and Social Security. We discuss Social Security in the
next section.

The exact nature and extent of these federal liabilities and those of
the smaller but often analogous state-local insurance program liabilities

are unclear. Various statements have been made which provide estimates of
the "maximum" exposure or risk or potential liabilities of the federal

government. For example, the federal government publishes annually a
document showing total insured deposits. Arthur Anderson & Co. (1986)
presents estimates of the maximum risk exposure in notes appended to a

government balance sheet. But as documented in Boskin, Barham, Cone and
Ozier (1987), the history of deposit insurance has been primarily one in

which the uninsured deposits are insured as well. These amount to thirty
percent of all bank deposits. But it is also unlikely that a severe
financial crisis would result in such payoffs. It is only imaginable in a
state of the world where the entire economy is in chaos and the government
would be forced to resort to hyperinflation to pay its debts.
On the other hand, current budgetary treatment of deposit insurance,

loans, and guarantees is misleading and inaccurate. There is no sense of
accrual accounting, usually only net spending (net of revenues) is reported,

there is no separate capital account, and no adjustment from par to market

value. Still, it is helpful to have some rough idea of the size and nature
of these contingent liabilities. Table 15 presents postwar time series data
on the total outstanding --

at

par value --

of

direct loans, loan

guarantees, and federally sponsored enterprise debt. It should be

Federally Sponsored Enterprises are the Federal National Mortgage
Association (FNMA)m the Federal Home Loan Banks, Federal Land Banks, Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, Banks
for Cooperatives and the Student Loan Mortgage Association.

emphasized that the total outstanding figures are not only at par value, but

include some double counting as there are secondary guarantees. To avoid
the double counting, a rough rule is that twenty or twenty-five percent of
the total outstanding in the recent years are secondary guarantees.

Each year new commitments amount to a tremendous volume of lending and

guaranteeing. For example, in 1986, new commitments of loan guarantees were

almost $300 billion. Of this total, the overwhelming bulk were renewing
previously extended guarantees that had expired. The total outstanding
year to year changes reflect the net new commitments. These figures do not
include deposit insurance or Social Security. Of these hundreds of
billions in outstanding loans and guarantees, what is a sensible estimate

of the contingent liability of the federal government? It is clearly
implausible that all the loans will default with probability one, so the
total outstanding amounts are a substantial upper bound (although Bartlett

(1983) adds them to the regular national debt). While some loans are
ultimately forgiven and cost the government the original amount, many are

repaid completely. The likely course of future repayments will reflect
various factors including economic conditions such as commodity prices,
interest rates, the level of real economic activity and the like.

It is possible to develop a lifecycle projection of new loan guarantee
commitments to determine, based on longitudinal data, the net spending
equivalent in present value terms that is likely to occur per dollar of new
commitments of loan guarantees and correspondingly for direct loans and

agency debt. While in some contingencies the historically based data might
prove to be exceedingly inaccurate, it is potentially useful to develop some
insight into the historical pattern of actual government spending and

support of guarantees and loans. Boskin, Barham, Cone and Ozier (1987)
present an analytical schema and apply it to longitudinal data on cohorts of

41

loan guarantees for government agencies, especially the Small Business
Administration, and they estimate that for each dollar of new commitment,
the present value of ultimate spending in support of that commitment is

approximately 12 cents. If -- and it is a big if -- such a figure could be
applied to other programs, a rough estimate of the likely value of the
ultimate federal government liability based on the value of the loans would
be about 12% of the figures reported in Table 15, about $30 billion dollars
in support of loans, $80 billion in support of loan guarantees, and perhaps

$50 billion in support of federally sponsored enterprises in 1985. There
are a variety of reasons to believe that the 12% figure may be too low or
too high in various circumstances for different kinds of lending activity,

but we only mention this because it has become somewhat fashionable either
to ignore these contingent liabilities or to report them as the maximum risk
exposure or the total value outstanding, as if that figure was readily

comparable to, say, the privately held regular national debt. Clearly, that
procedure is inappropriate.

Deposit insurance raises similar, through in some ways more subtle and

more quantitatively important issues. First, the nature of the banking
deposit insurance system is that the risks are systematically correlated to
a much greater extent than in other federal government lending programs.

There is a small probability of extremely high payouts. But even defining
the maximum exposure of the FDIC or FSLIC is questionable. As noted above,
the Treasury notes the total insured deposits. But that exceeeds by a
factor of at least 50 the properly measured net worth of the FDIC or FSLIC.

By law, the FDIC and FSLIC (and several other smaller analogous
organizations) have a line of credit at the Treasury, but this line of

credit is quite modest. Does the Treasury and/or the Federal Reserve stand

42

behind all insured depdsits? All deposits? Or only the amount in the
funds plus the standby borrowing authority at the Treasury? Total deposits
at insured banks were $l.974 trillion --

privately held national debt --

in

coincidently

about the size of the

1985, whereas the insured amounts were

$l.503 trillion. The total assets of the FDIC were $26.4 billion in 1985,
and the standby borrowing authority at the Treasury, $3 billion.

The FDIC and FSLIC are technically independent agencies, so they could
legally default on their liabilities without giving their creditors a claim

on the Treasury. Clearly, the potential liabilities of the FDIC and FSLIC
substantially exceed their assets in bad case scenarios. What is a sensible
expected present value to put forth for such contingent liabilities?

Surely, they are substantially less than either the total deposits insured

at institutions, or the total insured deposits. Formally, we would like to
sum the present discounted value of expected payouts in each period to

obtain an appropriate loss reserve as the best single number to provide as a

contingent liability. This would depend not only on future economic
conditions, but on the interpretation of the various rules, laws and

political decisions concerning backing the thrift industry. Rather than
present a time series of estimates, we refer the interested reader to
Boskin, Barham, Cone and Ozler (1987) for analytical discussion and report
in the balance sheets presented in Section 11 alternative estimates of these
contingent liabilities of the deposit insurance system.

As noted above, state-local government also have various contingent
obligations, including those to state chartered banks, unfunded pension

liabilities, etc. We raise these issues here but do not attempt to
elaborate the analysis.

10. Social Security
Because the Social Security program looms so large in the financial
picture of so many and because, until recently, it has been more or less a
pay-as-you-go system, the currently unfunded liabilities of the Social
Security system at any point in time are usually large, subject to
substantial variation depending upon assumed patterns of economic and
demographic trends, and subject to enormous change with seemingly minor
(relative to the intense debate over budget deficits and tax reform)

changes in rules relating to benefits or taxes. It is not our purpose here
to review the voluminous literature concerning the potential impact of
Social security "wealth" on real economic activity, such as the
saving/consumption choice or retirement decisions.46

How to define the expected obligations of the Social Security system

is also a subject of much controversy. Under a closed group approach, the
expected future taxes and benefits paid by particular cohorts, for example,
all those currently alive or currently above a certain age, such as 18,

would be calculated, discounted to the present, and compared. The
difference between the expected present value of benefits and taxes would

be the surplus or deficit. This concept, using current participants as the
group, is adapted by Arthur Anderson & Co. (1986). Under an open group
concept, the expected present value of benefits and taxes paid over some
time period, often taken to be the 75-year long-term actuarial projection
period of the Social Security Administration, would be compared, with the

46. The interested reader might consult Hurd and Boskin (1984), Diamond and
Hausman (1984), Feldstein (1974), and Barro (1974).

44

difference being the deficit or surplus. Thus, taxes paid in the early
working years of the currently unborn, and benefits paid to persons during
retirement who are not yet in the labor force, would be counted. While 75
years is an extremely long time period, and modest changes in growth rates
or demographic assumptions can make huge swings in the expected balances in
Social Security, swings the size of the regular national debt, the time
frame is somewhat arbitrary, as are the various assumptions involved.

Table 16 presents estimates of the long-term actuarial deficit in the
retirement and disability part of Social Security over the next 75 years
under alternative economic and demographic scenarios (as developed by Boskin

and Puffert (1987) and Boskin (l987b)). The annual amounts are adjusted for
inflation and discounted to the present at a real discount rate of 2% (the
interest rate assumed earned on Social Security balances by the Social

Security Trustees). As can be seen, in the base case, the Social Security
Administration's intermediate assumptions for economic and demographic
trends over the next 75 years, there is a deficit of almost one-half
trillion dollars, slightly under one-half percent of taxable payroll over

the period. Under the SSA actuary's optimistic assumptions, there is a $3.4
trillion surplus, while under the overall pessimistic assumptions, there is

a $2.6 trillion deficit. Thus, moving all of the economic and demographic
projections from intermediate to either optimistic or pessimistic results in

a change which is larger than the privately held national debt. But all of
the assumptions do not have to change for there to be an enormous variation

in the expected surplus. For example, leaving all the other assumptions
aside and just adopting the high wage growth assumptions of the SSA
actuaries results in a surplus of almost $900 billion, a $1.4 trillion

increase over the base case. Adopting the low mortality assumption, holding

all the other demographic assumptions and economic assumptions to those of
the intermediate case, results in a deficit of $1.7 trillion, a $1.2
trillion increase.

The numbers revealed in Table 16 are substantial, and Social Security
looms large in the lives of many Americans - -

there

are 37 million

current beneficiaries and over one hundred million taxpayers, the majority

of whom pay more in Social Security taxes than in income taxes. It would

be surprising if there were no effects of these variations. However, the
75 year period is somewhat arbitrary. The deficit occurs for a variety of
reasons, not the least of which is the passage of the extra large baby boom
generation into retirement, followed by the baby bust generation paying

high tax rates to finance the benefits of the baby boom. The period beyond
the 75 year projections would be one of surplus if the benefits were raised
no further and the high tax rates maintained as the ratio of workers to
47

retirees edges upwards as the baby bust generation retires.

For a variety of reasons, projections of Social Security deficits

should be taken with a certain degree of caution. Not only are they
enormously sensitive to these economic and demographic assumptions, about
which reasonable people might disagree, but future Social Security benefits
are also not contractual obligations in the same way as the regularly issued

national debt. While the national debt is issued in bonds of nominal dollar
value, and hence could be altered substantially by unexpected inflation as
emphasized by Eisner (1986), it is unlikely to be repudiated, even in part.
Social Security benefits and taxes and their difference, on the other hand,

result in a permanent increase in the aged dependency ratio.

46

are really pçntial future obligations. They can be changed by
Congressional action changing the benefit formulae, e.g., changing the bend
points in the retirement plan as proposed, but rejected, in the early l980s,

taxing all Social Security benefits, or one-half of them as was done in
1983, changing marginal tax rates in the income tax, as was done in the Tax
Reform Act of 1986, or raising the age of eligibility for future Social
Security beneficiaries, as was done in 1983 prospectively for the early
twenty-first century, etc.

Another important issue surrounds the fact that for the first time
Social Security retirement funds are projected to be on a path which

deviates systematically from pay-as-you-go finance. Under pay-as-you-go
finance, the long-term actuarial deficit in Social Security is identically
zero, as each year's benefits are paid by each year's taxes, although they
may not line up so evenly for a particular age group, income group or

families of different marital status. Concern about the long-run deficit
really seems to be concern about whether taxes will be raised or benefits
reduced when projections create a situation where the two are likely to

diverge systematically. For the old age and survivors insurance system,
the real discounted value of the projected surplus peaks around 2020 at
almost $800 billion (see Figure 16), and several hundred billion dollars

would be added by the disability fund. To provide some insight into the
possible difference in the Social Security retirement system's long-run

surplus, consider two scenarios: we use the temporary surplus to raise
benefits without correspondingly raising taxes later on in the 75 year

period; or we revert to pay-as-you-go finance by lowering tax rates during
the period of the surplus. As the final two rows of Table 16 reveal, the
long-run actuarial deficit in the retirement part of the system increases
to $3.7 trillion under the benefit-ratchetting up case, but is eliminated

under the pay-as-you-go tax rate reduction case (in which tax rates are
reduced during years of surplus and raised during the years of deficits to
restore the pay-as-you-go nature of the system).

The hospital insurance system is projected to be in much worse shape
than OASDI (see Figure 17), because the tax rate for HI is fixed at 2.9% of
taxable payroll, while health care expenditures are growing, partly for

demographic reasons and partly because of differential growth in health care

costs versus general inflation. Even if the latter is brought under
control, the demographics will cause the expenditures under the hospital

insurance part of medicare to rise, so when compared with slowly growing tax

revenues, the deficit must widen. Thus, over the next several decades the
options for Social Security are:

(1) Accruing a surplus in the retirement and disability funds;

(2) Dissipating it for other uses such as assigning some of the tax
proceeds to medicare, etc.
For all these reasons we prefer to provide the supplemental
information concerning Social Security as additional potential liabilities

in any balance sheet for the government sector. We do not propose to add
it to the regular national debt.48

48. In addition to the Social Security system's accrued liabilities, the federal
government has substantial other accrued pension liabilities as well. These
include military, veteran, and civilian retirement and disability
compensation plans. Various studies have been done analogous to those on
Social Security, attempting to estimate these liabilities. The pension
funds of current military employees and the civil service pension system,
while probably subject to revision in years ahead, represent some
substantial degree of contractual obligation of the federal government.
They amount to well over one trillion dollars among them. The unfunded
pension liabilities of state and local governments have been, at times,
substantial. Again, similar caveats to those mentioned above apply.

11. Government Balance Sheets

With our estimates of government tangible and financial assets and
liabilities, the temptation to create government balance sheets is

irresistible. Before giving in, however, we must stress numerous
caveats and cautions.

While we believe that we have developed improved estimates of

tangible

assets, each of the major categories of assets and liabilities presents
conceptual and measurement difficulties. The 'net worth' figures we shall

present are, accordingly subject to substantial error. Moreover, extremely
important classes of liabilities -

contingent

and potential -

are

excluded,

at least above the line, because, unlike financial liabilities or assets,
they are mostly not traded on a market or easily quantified with existing

data and are subject to large uncertainty. Presenting rough estimates of
contingent liabilities on loans, guarantees, and deposit insurance and
potential liabilities in unfunded pension programs (especially Social
Security) "below the line" is not meant to suggest that they are less

important than those included above the line. However, they are subject to
different degrees of precision, contractual olbligation and conceptual

estimation. Also, they are taken from other sources (althougy some are by
Boskin). Of course, governments have enormous intangible assets, including
the power to tax, so a negative net worth would not imply bankruptcy or

imminent debt repudiation. Accordingly, our calculations, like similar ones
by Eisner and Pieper (1984) and Eisner (1986), should probably be viewed as
illustrative of trends, rather than accurate point estimates of net worth.
Further, how to add up various components is by no means obvious.

Finance theory tells us we should place greater value on future income
streams which are negatively correlated with other sources of income.

49

Thus, if one concludes that the value of government mineral rights will
rise substantially when oil prices accelerate sharply, and this is

associated with a deep recession or some other long-lived economic
event, these revenues may be systematically negatively correlated with

other sources of government revenue; and similar issues arise on the

outlay side. The conceptually proper thing would be to apply a risk
charge to the various components in the various time periods based on
subjective probability distributions of outcomes and estimates of the
risk tolerance (the reciprocal of the Arrow-Pratt measure of risk

aversion), and discount them to the present. We have not sought to do
this here, but do wish to emphasize that the variability of likely
future returns or outlays stemming from various government activities is
large, as it is for the private sector, but there may also be systematic

covariance among components which should be taken into account in
establishing a balance sheet.

Estimates of the real change in net worth have important, but still

limited, uses. The net worth provides some indication of future tax
liabilities. When oil was discovered in Alaska, expected future tax
liabilities of Alaskan residents dropped dramatically.

Changes in net worth indicate what legacy, in the form of future
government service net of tax liabilities, current generations are

providing future generations. Of course, this does not imply that the
only ethical course is to leave net worth unchanged.

If future

generations will be richer, or if the current generation has made large
sacrifices, as, for example, in World War II, it may be entirely
appropriate to pass tax burdens forward.

Changes in net worth are not necessarily a good indicator of fiscal

tightness. But information on conventional deficits may usefully be

50

supplemented by various adjustments to government assets and liabilities.
Eisner and Pieper (1984) and Eisner (1986) provide some evidence that
changes in real net debt are a better measure of fiscal policy than

conventional deficits. Boskin (1986a) presents evidence that the private
propensity to consume out of the excess of government tangible capital over
explicit debt is 0.04, about the same as generally found for private wealth.
This suggests that public and private saving are substitutes in the sense
that increased government tangible capital increases private consumption and

decreases private saving. These studies indicate that the type of data
generated in this paper may be of some use in the studies of the impact of
fiscal policy on short-run stabilization and/or long-run growth.
Having discussed their usefulness and limitations, we turn to the

numbers. In Table 17, balance sheets for the federal government for 1970,
1980, and 1985 are provided. As throughout this paper, the figures are in
1985 dollars. While real liabilities of the federal government grew by 18%
between 1970 and 1980, the net debt, due in part to rising gold prices, fell

by 14%. Net worth grew by $692 billion, to over $1.0 trillion. While many
were bemoaning record deficits, the value of federal assets, especially oil

and gas, was growing rapidly. In the 1980's, the picture is very different.
Despite large investment in reproducible assets, particularly for the
military, the value of federal assets increased by about 8% (less if 1986

were considered, because of falling real oil prices). Meanwhile, federal
liabilities reached record levels. The result is that net worth dropped by
$727 billion in only five years, unravelling the gains made over the '70s.
Most of this drop occured after the end of the recession.
State and local government net worth, excluding pension obligations,

also grew substantially during the '70s, as shown in Table 18. Tangible

State-local mineral rights estimates are calculated only for 1980
and 1985 and because of the data limitations are perhaps less reliable
than the other items included. Tangible assets and "net worth" for 1970
are understated because of the absence of a mineral rights estimate.
See text for a discussion of contingent liabilities and unfunded pensions.
lncludes real revaluations as discussed in text.
From R. Inman (1985). Estimates are for 1980 and include teachers
retirement systems only; they are therefore a lower bound.

-

assets increased by about $1.0 trillion, while net debt fell. Net worth

grew by more than 80% in real terms. Neither net debt nor tangible assets
changed much from 1980 to 1985, so that net worth remained about $2.5

trillion. The net worth of state and local governments is still larger,
according to our calculations, than the total financial liabilities of the
federal

government.

Finally, with the provisos mentioned above, we report estimates from

other sources of

large contingent and potential liabilities. For example,

the estimate of the unfunded liability for the retirement and disability
part of Social Security is almost $500 billion under the intermediate

economic and demographic projections; for hospital insurance, it is over
two trillion dollars (see Boskin (1987b) and Boskin and Puffert (1987)).

Federal civil service and military retirement systems unfunded liabilities
amounted to over $1 trillion for 1980.

12. Conclusion
We have presented above new, updated, and adjusted estimates of
various components of the government's contribution - -

- to

positive

or negative

national wealth and its growth in the postwar period. We have

invoked numerous caveats along the way, and have attempted to highlight

what we believe are some important points. We have not gone as deeply
into some aspects of these issues as some other previous authors, in

order to go further in other dimensions of the problem. Our primary
substantive conclusions are as follows:

(1) The share of national output devoted to consumption has risen
substantially, while that devoted to net saving has fallen sharply, in

the period 1951-85. The private consumption rate has risen about six
percentage points, from 63% to 69% over this period, while the

52

government consumption rate has fallen slightly. The national saving
rate has fallen about four percentage points.

(2) The federal government consumption rate has fallen dramatically,

from 13.7% to 8.7% from 1950-85. In the same period, the state and local
consumption rate has risen from 9.7% to 12.6%.

(3) The extension of traditional saving and investment measurement
to include consumer durable and government tangible investment raises
the national saving rate substantially, as do our depreciation estimates.

For example, in 1985, the gross and net saving rates rise from a
traditionally measured 13.8% and 3.2% to 24.5% and 8.8%, respectively,
about one and a half percentage points of the increased net saving rate

resulting from our lower estimates of depreciation on conventionally defined
business capital.

(4) The federal government's assets, tangible and financial, are
substantial; throughout the 1970's, they grew much more rapidly than the

national debt. By 1980, in constant 1985 dollars we estimate federal
tangible assets at $1.7 trillion and financial assets at $940 billion
compared to liabilities of $1.5 trillion.

(5) Since about 1980, the "net worth" news is much worse, as
conventional liabilities have grown much faster than assets, causing about
a $727 billion decline in federal "net worth".

(6) The state and local government sector also contributes
importantly to government and national wealth. The state and local sector
fixed reproducible capital is about twice the federal amount, $1.9 trillion

in 1985 versus $1.0 trillion. The difference between assets and
liabilities is also greater, as well as more stable, for state and local

governments. The estimated "net worth" of state and local goverments was

53

about $2.5 trillion in both 1980 and 1985.

(7) Total government reproducible capital amounts to a sizeable
fraction of corresponding private capital. In 1985, the public capital
stock was 55% of the private nonresidential capital stock.

(8) Government net investment has often been sufficient to turn
the government sector into a net saver despite large budget deficits,
i.e. assets were accruing more rapidly than liabilities.

(9) It is important, if difficult, to go beyond traditional
structures and equipment investment and capital stocks. Inventories,
mineral rights, and land are quantitatively quite important (over $900

billion in 1985 for the federal government alone) and the most volatile
components of government saving. Real revaluations of tangible capital,
inventories, land and mineral rights are frequently substantial.

(10) Very large contingent and potential liabilities must be
considered, although we prefer not to add them directly to the more

contractual obligations. Changes in rules governing social security, for
example, can produce changes in potential unfunded liabilities almost as

large as the regular privately held national debt. Some previous attempts
to incorporate contingent liabilities and unfunded pensions have
inappropriately focused on either the maximum risk exposure in the former
and a closed group concept of liabilities for the latter.

In establishing the value of various components and aggregate
government assets, liabilities and net worth, the covariance of the likely
revenues or outlays associated with the assets and liabilities with other
returns and outlays for the government, and indeed, other components of

national income, must be considered. We have not even begun to do so here.
Additional considerations concern the government's power to print money and
to tax.

54

We hope that this study, by focusing attention on the role of the
government sector in the generation and formation of national wealth will
join a growing list of important studies enabling us to improve the system
of accounts used in reporting economic activity in the United States and in

analyzing the performance of the economy. Much research remains to be done
before some of the thorny issues addressed here are resolved to the extent
that such accounts can stand alongside traditional national income accounts

on a daily basis,49 but the evidence from this and other recent studies
suggest that failing to do so may seriously distort our notion of the
levels and rates of growth of national saving, capital formation, and other
dimensions of economic performance.

49. Attempts to measure either private or government saving, investment or
consumption and correspondingly private and government capital should
use depreciation methods consistent in treatment of relative vintages of
the capital stock, i.e., depreciation methods consistent between
formation of the capital stock series and the imputed rental flow
series. This is not true of the national income and product accounts
depreciation, nor of the depreciation methods and estimates used in most
studies of growth accounting. Two recent important exceptions are
Jorgenson, Gollop and Fraumeni (1987) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics
(1983). While it is not our purpose to evaluate the importance of these
distinctions in growth accounting, some studies (see Jorgenson (1986))
suggest that these differences can be enormously important in
partitioning the sources of growth. For our purposes it is clear that
the depreciation series, and therefore the net investment series and
capital stock series, differ substantially, primarily because of
differences in the treatment of structures, relative to NIPA and the BEA
capital stock series.

Source Notes for Tables and Fi&ures

Table 1. Fixed reproducible capital includes equipment and nonresidential
and residential structures. The BEA series are 1982$ constant cost
estimates updated to 1985$ by our use of price series implicit in the BEA
current and constant cost estimates of net capital stocks and depreciation

flows for each asset category. The same procedure was used to convert our
estimates from 1982$ into 1985$. Our estimates employ the perpetual
inventory method and use BEA gross investment data. Given the evidence of
Hulten and Wykoff (1981) on the depreciation of private assets, we assume
geometric depreciation of government capital with a declining-balance rate
for equipment of l.65/(service life) and for structures of O.91/(service

life). We use BEA estimated service lives, including detailed lives
available for some types of capital based on observed usage, to infer
depreciation rates, except that we assume a shorter 40 year service life for

highways and streets. The 1986 BEA wealth data tape, unpublished BEA data
kindly provide by John Musgrave, and several Survey of Current Business

articles are our principal data sources. See text for further details on
our methods.

Table 2. See note to Table 1 and text.

Table 4. Source: Unpublished BEA 1982 constant dollar estimates of end-ofyear stocks of federal government military, federal government nonmilitary,

and state and local government inventories were each updated to 1985
constant dollars by multiplying by the ratio of the 1985 BEA current dollar
stock to the 1985 constant (1982) dollar stock for each type.

Revaluations

are calculated as described in text.

Table 5. Private nonresidential capital includes our estimates of fixed
private nonresidential capital and inventories. Inventory data is from the

1986 Economic Report of the President, Table B-17; 1982 constant dollar

stocks were updated to 1985$ by multiplying by the ratio of 1985 current to
constant (1982) dollar stock.

Our estimates of the private fixed nonresidential capital stock may be

considered an updating of those in Hulten and Wykoff (1981). We use gross
investment data from the 1986 BEA wealth data tape. We assume geometric
depreciation patterns and generally use the depreciation rates estimated by

Hulten and Wykoff. For asset categories where depreciation rates were
inferred by Hulten and Wykoff from the the average relationships 6
=l.65/(service life) for equipment and S =O.91/(service life) for structures
and where the BEA estimated service lives have been revised, as reported in

Gorman et al (1985), we calculated revised depreciation rates. Where there
are now multiple service lives for asset subcategories within a type of
capital, we have used the subcategory service life closest to the previous
single service life for the asset type to infer a single depreciation rate.
We convert our constant dollar estimates from 1982$ to 1985$ by using the
price indices implicit in BEA current and constant cost estimates for each
asset type.

Our estimates of net private residential capital are based on BEA gross
investment and service life data and a geometric depreciation rate of
O.91/(servjce life), which is the average relationship for nonresidential

structures found by Hulten and Wykoff (1981). Gross investment data is from
the 1986 BEA wealth data tape and the BEA detailed industry investment tape.
BEA service lives are listed in Gorman et al (1985).

For consumer durables our estimates use BEA gross investment data from
the 1986 BEA wealth data tape and employ BEA estimated service lives to
infer geometric depreciation rates for some assets (see Musgrave (1979)).
For durables other than vehicles we assume double-declining balance

depreciation. For vehicles we use the depreciation rates for the
corresponding business categories estimated by Hulten and Wykoff. Again,
our 1982$ estimates are updated to 1985$ by using price indices implicit in
the BEA current and constant dollar data for each type of consumer durable.

Government reproducible capital includes equipment, inventories, and

all structures. See notes to Tables 1 and 4.
Table 7. Our adjustments to NIPA measures to better account for government
capital and consumer durables are described in Table 5 and in the text.
Here we use current dollar data and present our saving, investment, and
capital consumption series as percentages of expanded GNP, i.e. NIPA GNP
expanded to include rental flows from general government capital and

consumer durables. For the three decades from 1951 to 1980 we present
simple averages of annual figures for the decade.

Government saving equals the traditionally measured budget balance plus
government net investment in reproducible capital and land.

Our net

investment estimates and the capital consumption figures reported use our
estimates of the depreciation of government capital, fixed private capital,

and consumer durables; the latter is included here in "private capital
consumption.

Table 8. These estimates are derived from our 1985 constant dollar
adjustment of the NIPAs to account for government capital and consumer

durables. Denominators (GNP or NNP for gross and net saving rates
respectively) in each column have been expanded to include the rental flows
associated with the types of government investment included in the

numerator. The depreciation estimates used are from our calculations, as
described earlier. For this reason the net saving rates reported here in
column 1 differ from those calculated from NIPA data, which obviously uses

the NIPA capital consumption allowance instead.

Table 10. Source: Par-to-market indices kindly provided by Paul Pieper and
described in an appendix to Eisner (1986) were applied to end-of-year 1985
data on government financial assets and liabilities contained in the Federal

Reserve Flow of Funds Accounts. See text.
Table 11. Net debt is defined by Eisner as the excess of government
financial liabilities over financial assets. Current dollar series on the
estimated market value of government financial liabilities and assets for
1945-84 are taken from Eisner (1986) and converted into 1985$ via the GNP

deflator. The differences in these series for federal and state-local
governments are reported here as net debt. Estimates for 1985 are from
Table 10.

Table 12. The value of oil and gas rights for 1981 was obtained from
estimates of proven and undiscovered, but economically recoverable, reserves

on federal land, 1981 prices, royalty rates, historic ratios of bonuses to

future royalties. The values for other years was obtained by adjusting for
bonuses and royalties paid and price changes. A detailed description of the
methodology and underlying assumptions, as well as sensitivity analyses, are

given in Boskin, Robinson, O'Reilly and Kumar (1985). The series was
converted to 1985 dollars using the GNP deflator.
