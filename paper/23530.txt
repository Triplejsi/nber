ABSTRACT
Little is known about how the adoption and diffusion of medical innovation is related to and
influenced by market characteristics such as competition. The particular complications involved
in investigating these relationships in the health care sector may explain the dearth of research.
We examine diagnostic angiography, percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), and coronary
artery bypass grafting (CABG), three invasive cardiac services. We document the relationship
between the adoption by hospitals of these three invasive cardiac services and the characteristics
of hospitals, their markets, and the interactions among them, from 1996-2014. The results show
that the probability of hospitals adopting a new cardiac service depends on competition in two
distinct ways: 1) hospitals are substantially more likely to adopt an invasive cardiac service if
competitor hospitals also adopt new services; 2) hospitals are less likely to adopt a new service if
a larger fraction of the nearby population already has geographic access to the service at a nearby
hospital. The first effect is stronger, leading to the net effect of hospitals duplicating access rather
than expanding access to care. In addition, for-profit hospitals are considerably more likely to
adopt these cardiac services than either nonprofit or government-owned hospitals. Nonprofit
hospitals in high for-profit markets are also more likely to adopt them relative to other nonprofits.
These results suggest that factors other than medical need, such as a medical arms race, partially
explain technological adoption.

Introduction
Innovation is often an important product of competition. Yet, although researchers have

studied some causes of the adoption and diffusion of medical innovations, little is known about
how that adoption is related to and influenced by market characteristics such as competition. The
relationships between competition and technological innovation (Aghion et al., 2014) and the
diffusion of innovation (Shapiro, 2012) are difficult to specify, even in markets for ordinary
goods. The particular complications involved in investigating these relationships in the health
care sector may explain the dearth of research.
Because medical care is so different from ordinary market goods, it is even more difficult
to characterize competitive medical markets and to predict or identify how competition affects
innovation and diffusion of medical technology than in the case of other goods and services.
Unlike other goods, in which the concentration of suppliers in populated areas helps consumers
benefit from low prices, dispersion of medical suppliers is critical for patient access. In addition,
medical care is often provided by hospitals, which are highly regulated, are organized as
different types of legal entities, compete as local monopolies and oligopolies, receive payments
from third parties instead of patients, and receive reimbursements based on governmentregulated prices rather than market demand. Further, prices are not posted, and are typically
unknown both to patients and medical staff. Unsurprisingly, there is no general theory of
competition in such markets, much less a theory to explain the effects of such competition on
technology development and diffusion. Despite these challenges, providing appropriate access to
care, controlling costs, and insuring the quality of medicine all critically depend on
understanding how and why medical providers adopt technology. Therefore, we document

1

important empirical regularities that provide evidence of the effects of hospital competition on
the provision of care.
To investigate the connection between competition and medical technology diffusion, we
study the relationship between the adoption of invasive cardiac services by hospitals and the
characteristics of those hospitals, their markets, and the interactions among them. The bulk of
payments for invasive cardiac services at hospitals come from government payers, making it
unlikely that differences in demand because of price explain our results. In addition, we include
rich controls for market demographics that are strong predictors of the need for cardiac
interventions.
We focus on the adoption of three types of invasive cardiac services from 1996-2014:
diagnostic angiography, percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), and coronary artery bypass
grafting (CABG). These are particularly important services to study for several reasons. First,
these services are meant to treat heart attacks (acute myocardial infarctions or AMIs), a leading
cause of morbidity and mortality around the world and in the United States, making the
interventions critical for a large part of the national and world populations. Second, AMI is one
of the five most expensive inpatient conditions to treat; in 2013 AMI accounted for
approximately $12 billion or 3.2 percent of national aggregate costs for all hospitalizations and
602,000 hospitalizations (Torio and Moore, 2016). Understanding the diffusion of treatments
would help develop interventions to control their costs. Third, there is evidence that for some
patients, medical therapy alone is as effective as the far more expensive and invasive PCI.
Finally, there is large variation in treatment of cardiovascular disease by geographic area, and
those differences are “predominantly driven by differences in local capacity and local medical
decision making” (Wennberg, 1999, preface). These findings suggest that the diffusion and use

2

of medical technology are driven, at least in part, by factors other than medical need. There is
room for policy interventions that guide diffusion to increase the efficiency of medical care.
Previous research has demonstrated that by 2000, almost 80 percent of the U.S.
population lived within 60 minutes of a hospital with PCI (Nallamothu et. al., 2006). Given this
coverage, there has been little room for new hospitals to increase geographic access to care.
Previous research has shown that hospitals are most likely to introduce new invasive cardiac
services when neighboring hospitals already offer such services, and this diffusion has not
improved geographic access to care, but rather duplicated existing services (Horwitz et al., 2013;
Concannon et al., 2012). In fact, because hospitals are more likely to adopt a service if nearby
hospitals already offer it, simulations suggest that more people would have had greater
geographic access to care if, instead of allowing hospitals to decide whether to adopt a new
service, new services had been randomly distributed to existing hospitals that did not already
offer them (Horwitz et al., 2013). Strategic selection of hospitals to newly offer care would
improve access more than random distribution, so the pattern of endogenous selection we find
here is doubly inferior to the first best.
This paper builds on those findings in several important ways. First, unlike previous
research which uses fixed distances, geopolitical designations, or hospital referral regions to
define markets, we define hospital markets by travel time to the hospital based on medical
recommendations of how quickly patients suffering the symptoms of a heart attack should be
treated. Second, we consider hospital and market characteristics related to adoption of new
technology. The latter include demographic characteristics of the population in each hospital’s
market, which are important to consider because these characteristics are associated with the
probability that residents are insured, the type of insurance, and the costs and profit margins of

3

medical treatment. The services studied here are both expensive to provide and, on average,
profitable for hospitals, making the demographics of the patient population particularly
significant for a hospital’s bottom line. Third, we focus on the role of the legal ownership of
hospitals – nonprofit, for-profit, and government. Here we consider the role of ownership in a
hospital adopting new services as well as the role of the market mix and the interaction between
the two, factors that play important roles in the decisions of hospitals to offer medical services
(Horwitz and Nichols, 2009). Finally, our study period, 1996-2014, is lengthy.
We find the probability of hospitals adopting a new cardiac service depends on
competition in two distinct ways. First, hospitals are substantially more likely to adopt an
invasive cardiac service (defined as performing 11 or more such procedures per year) if
competitor hospitals (defined as those within an hour drive of the observation hospital) also
adopt new services. However, we also find that hospitals are less likely to adopt a new service if
a larger fraction of the nearby population already has geographic access to the service at a nearby
hospital (defined as residents that live within an hour drive of the observation hospital also live
within an hour of another hospital offering that service).
Although these two effects are offsetting, the response of hospitals mimicking nearby
adoption despite that hospital’s patient market already having access to care has the net effect of
duplicating access rather than substantially expanding access to care. That is, for a hospital
which has not yet adopted a particular invasive cardiac service, the adoption of the service by
nearby hospitals increases the proportion of the population that has access, which modestly
reduces the probability a given hospital adopts it, but the local increase in adoptions dominates,
leading to a net increase in its probability of adoption. These results suggest that hospitals are

4

engaging in a medical arms race rather than offering services that would increase geographic
access to care.
Moreover, during the study period, for-profit hospitals are considerably more likely to
adopt the three services studied here than either nonprofit or government-owned hospitals.
Nonprofit hospitals also are more likely to adopt these cardiac services if they are in a high forprofit market, relative to nonprofit hospitals in a market with lower for-profit penetration,
However, tests regarding the relationship among the ownership of an individual hospital and
whether competitors adopt a service yield few consistent or statistically significant results. In
sum, the evidence is consistent with previous research on geographic variation in health care and
suggest that factors other than medical need explain technological adoption.
2.

Background
Technology progress in medicine has saved many lives. Cutler (2004), for example, has

shown that technological innovation and associated spending has been, on average, well worth
the costs. However, other researchers have questioned the value of rapid development and
diffusion of medical technology. For example, Robinson and Luft (1985) characterized new
service adoption as the result of a medical arms race, one that leads to inefficient investment in
medical technology. Scholars later found evidence that the acquisition of new medical
technology was driven by, among other factors, a hospital’s attempt to maintain or expand a
local market (Hillman et al., 1987) and the importance a hospital attaches to being a
technological leader (Teplensky et al., 1995). Skinner & Staiger (2015, pg. 3) made progress in
reconciling these views—that technology adoption led to improvements in health and that
technology adoption was caused by, at least in part, nonmedical reasons—in arguing that health

5

care “improvements are largely associated with the adoption of effective treatments, rather than
more factor inputs per se.”
Indeed, researchers have found that expensive and profitable medical technology diffuses
before there is a strong case for its widespread use. For example, Ladapo et al. (2009) found that
64-slice computed tomography was widely adopted by hospitals for its role in angiography for
cardiac patients despite the lack of evidence regarding its effectiveness for that purpose, raising
concerns about haphazard acquisition.
The services we focus on here—diagnostic angiography, PCI, and CABG—provide apt
examples of this phenomenon found in health care more generally. Diagnostic cardiac
angiography is a procedure that involves the placement of a catheter through veins or arteries and
into the heart to inject a contrast agent, taking a picture with an x-ray machine, and evaluating
whether the patient has a blockage in a coronary artery (Lange and Hillis, 2003). PCI,
commonly called coronary angioplasty, is a procedure that opens coronary arteries that have
been blocked by plaque. A doctor inflates a balloon at the tip of a catheter to open an artery and
may place a stent to keep the artery open. CABG, commonly known as open heart surgery, is a
surgery to allow blood to flow to the heart by using a healthy artery or vein from a patient and
grafting it into a coronary artery so as to go around the blocked portion of the artery.
These services have provided great value for some patients, but not for all (Chandra &
Skinner, 2012). On the one hand, advances in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular
disease, including the services studied here, have led to striking improvements in morbidity and
mortality. For example, from the mid-1970s through the early 2000s, age-adjusted death rates
from coronary heart disease declined by more than 60 percent (Weisfeldt and Zieman, 2007).
Cutler and Kadiyala (2003) estimate that about one third of these reductions can be explained by

6

invasive procedures. In another estimate, Cutler and McClellan (2001) conclude that
approximately 70 percent of the survival improvement in cardiac mortality between 1984 and
1998 was attributable to technological change.
On the other hand, there is evidence of considerable geographic variation in treatment.
Matlock et al. (2013) found that “the 2007 rate of coronary angiography varied nearly 6-fold
from 6.8 per 1000 Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries in Honolulu, [Hawaii], to 39.8
per 1000 in Gulfport, [Mississippi]” (p. 3). In addition, in 2003, “[r]ates varied by a factor of
five, from 1.9 per 1,000 enrollees to 9.5.” (Center, 2005, p. 9).
There is also evidence of overuse. For example, a meta-analysis of randomized
controlled trials evaluating outcomes of treatment for stable coronary artery disease with PCI
compared to medical therapy concluded, “Initial stent implantation for stable coronary artery
disease shows no evidence of benefit compared with initial medical therapy for prevention of
death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unplanned revascularization, or angina” (Stergiopoulos
and Brown, 2012 at p. 312; Boden, 2012; Stergiopoulos et al., 2014). Although PCI volume
declined after the publication of these results, many patients continued to receive PCI for stable
coronary artery disease (Howard and Shen, 2014). In addition, findings that high spending is not
well correlated with mortality and readmission outcomes in studies that control for population
characteristics (Skinner et al. 2006) suggest that there is considerable room for reform to
eliminate wasteful and unnecessary care. On the other hand, there is also evidence that higher
spending hospitals perform more procedures in the first part of a hospital stay, leading to higher
cost and higher short-term mortality but dramatically lower long-term mortality (Doyle et al.,
2015).

7

Service diffusion may also lead to reductions in the volume of procedures performed at
individual hospitals and related reductions in quality. Professional guidelines recommend against
the provision of cardiac interventions by low-volume physicians or at low-volume cardiac
centers, although those guidelines recognize the complicated and potentially offsetting
relationship among institutional and individual operators. (Levine et al., 2011). The positive,
albeit attenuating, association between volume and outcomes (Ross et al., 2010) suggests that
diffusion concentrated within hospital markets may undermine the effectiveness of the
treatments studied here. That is, it may be optimal to perform a more limited number of
interventions in a more restricted set of cases in a broad geographic area, but outcomes may be
better as more interventions are performed in a location, suggesting that the concentration of
procedures in a smaller number of hospitals is better for patients.
In fact, some researchers have found that lower volume occurs in markets where hospitals
have begun performing CABGs, and that such low volume has led to increased mortality
(Wilson, 2007). However, others have found that improvements in the quality of technology,
implementing safeguards like checklists, and physician skill have led to decreased CABG
mortality overall. (Finks, 2011). Similarly, Ho (2002) found that as hospitals developed staff
capacity to provide percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), they achieved
substantial reductions in inpatient mortality and emergency bypass surgery. Yet, hospital
procedure volume was also associated with a small positive effect on outcomes. Ho concludes
that centralizing PTCA by offering it at fewer hospitals could lower costs, but may not have a
strong effect on quality. Nonetheless, in an effort to improve quality, there have been calls for
concentrating AMI treatment to a limited number high quality, centralized providers that offer
PCI treatment within a region. (Chen et. al., 2010).

8

Finally, these services are quite costly and, to the extent that they are unnecessary,
reducing inappropriate provision could lead to large savings. Cardiovascular disease accounts
for 17 percent of national health expenditures; given the aging of the U.S. population, the direct
costs of treating cardiovascular disease are predicted to triple from $273 to $818 billion, in 2008
dollars, between 2010 and 2030 (Heidenreich et al., 2011).

Data and Market Definitions.
3.1

Data and Descriptive Statistics

Data on hospital characteristics are from the American Hospital Association’s Annual
Surveys of Hospitals (AHA) 1996-2014. We include all non-federal, general medical and
surgical hospitals and heart hospitals in the continental United States, including those in the
District of Columbia. We exclude children’s hospitals and hospitals for which driving times to
nearby residential zip codes could not be computed (including several rural cases, and one
hospital on an island). We identified the longitude and latitude of each hospital from the AHA or,
if the AHA coordinates were missing or differed among years for the same address, we identified
the coordinates using Google maps.
To determine whether a hospital treated any patients with AMI and whether a hospital
provided any of the three services examined here, we rely on data from Medicare Provider
Analysis and Review (MedPar) files for 100 percent of Medicare beneficiaries who received
hospital inpatient services 1996-2014. The MedPar dataset included only fee-for-service
beneficiaries who were eligible for both Medicare Part A and B and were also U.S. residents.
Because of restrictions that forbid using federal data with values smaller than eleven in a cell, we
coded a hospital as having treated patients with AMI if they treated at least eleven patients in a
year with an International Classification of Diseases-9 (ICD-9) primary diagnosis code for AMI

9

(ICD-9 Codes 410.00-410.92). We identified a hospital as providing a service in a given year if
that hospital billed the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for at least eleven procedures
to Medicare beneficiaries, using the following ICD-9 codes: diagnostic angiography (37.21
through 37.23); PCI (depending on the year 36.01-.02; 00.66; 36.05-36.07); and CABG
(36.1036.19). Once a hospital is coded as providing a service, we assume the hospital continues
to provide the service for as long as it is in the sample, a reasonable assumption given the costs
of starting new invasive cardiac services. We coded all other hospitals as not treating patients
with an AMI diagnosis or as not providing one or more of the invasive cardiac services studied
here. Adoption is defined as the first year after 1996 in which a service is offered.
We identified the centroid of every zip code tabulation area (ZCTA) using shape files
available from the U.S. Census Bureau for the 2010 Census. Demographic data for each ZCTA
are from the American Community Survey (2010-2014) and the U.S. Census (2000). We
attributed the 2010-14 ACS to 2012. We then interpolated and extrapolated from these data to
all years in the sample using a log or logit scale for demographic variables that were counts or
percentages, respectively.
Driving distances are primarily from Google maps and, secondarily, from Open Source
Road Mapping System (OSRM). We relied on OSRM to estimate approximate travel times and
distances based on the closest road only when Google Maps did not estimate driving distance,
such as when the centroid of a ZCTA lies in a rural area without roads, on an island, or in a body
of water.
4.2

Market Definitions and Competitor Attributes

Our definition of geographic markets differs from others in health economics research.
Previous researchers typically use political configurations such as counties or, more recently,

10

hospital referral regions. The former do not track actual markets for care well (Wennberg,
1999). Although hospital referral regions are an improvement over using political areas to define
health care markets, they define markets based on the actual use of medical services at hospitals
and not the markets that would best serve patients. Because we are interested in how
competition may or may not produce access to medically-indicated care in this project, which
endogenously affects actual use patterns, we use a definition of market based on a potential
patient’s travel time to each hospital.
We identified each hospital’s market to include all the residents of ZCTAs, the centroid
of which is sixty minutes or shorter driving time in a car to the hospital. We chose sixty minutes
based on medical guidelines recommending the maximum amount of time from a patient’s first
contact with emergency medical personnel to treatment and the total amount of time from
symptoms to treatment that produce the best medical outcomes. More specifically, although
medical authorities often refer to a “first golden hour” in which myocardial infarction can be
treated with the best results (Boersma et. al., 1996), therefore making the sixty-minute driving
time too long for the best results, medical recommendation recognize the difficulty of such rapid
treatment and tend to include longer times. For example, for primary PCI, some sources report
that the “[b]est clinical outcomes…[are] achieved within 120 minutes after symptom onset.”
(Bates and Jacobs, 2013, p. 890). Bates and Jacobs (2013) recommended a maximum “door-toballoon” time of 90 minutes. Meeting this standard has become the focus of national quality
improvement initiatives as well as quality markers for CMS reimbursement (Menees et al.,
2013). In 2008, median time between arrival at the hospital and treatment was 76 minutes for
patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who are undergoing
percutaneous coronary intervention (Flynn et. al., 2010), which represented an improvement over

11

past years. That implies that during our study period, fewer than half of patients with STEMI
were treated within the time recommended by guidelines (Bradley et al., 2006). Moreover, mean
symptom duration is two hours before first medical contact (Bates and Jacobs, 2013), i.e. patients
are receiving treatment several hours after symptom onset in most cases, which leads to worse
outcomes.
Further, for each observation hospital in our dataset, we identified another hospital as a
competitor if that hospital is within a sixty minute drive from the centroid of the observation
hospital’s zip code. However, as all nearby hospitals contribute to a weighted mean which also
uses current admissions as a measure of size, small variations in measured distance from a focal
hospital have minimal influence on measured adoption rates; that is, the weighted mean is very
robust to small errors in measurement of distance.
Thus, there are measures of (1) the population that lives in the market area of each
hospital, and characteristics of that population, (2) the fraction of that population that is within an
hour of another hospital providing the relevant cardiac service, and (3) nearby hospitals’ service
offerings. Note that when a nearby hospital adds a new service, it has two effects: some nearby
zip codes may newly have access to cardiac care (there is a drop in the population counted as
having no access), but the fraction of nearby hospitals offering the service jumps at other nearby
hospitals which are at risk of adding the service. These two changes are correlated but very
imperfectly, both due to the sizes of affected areas and differences in the weighting (population
weights across all nearby zip codes, or admission weights across all nearby hospitals). With these
two imperfectly correlated variables used as separate predictors, we expect the standard errors to
be larger but to the extent that effects are large enough to be detectable, there is no bias
introduced by modest collinearity.

4.

Empirical Specification
In our main specifications, we investigate the extent to which the probability that each

hospital adopts a new service (alternately diagnostic services, PCI, and CABG) in a given year
depends upon (1) the percentage of patients in the market that already have access to these
services in the current year, and (2) the percentage of competing hospitals in the market that also
adopt a service that same year. More specifically, we fit a discrete-time hazard model to annual
data, assuming that the hazard of adoption (conditional probability of adoption of a given
technology by the hospital, given no adoption to date) is proportional to a common baseline
hazard specified flexibly over time. The continuous time Proportional Hazard (PH) model is of
the form log(Hit; Xit) = f(t) + Xitb or Hit = exp(f(t) + Xitb), where f(t) is an arbitrary function of
time. The interval-censored PH model is of the form cloglog(Hij; Xij) = g(j) + Xijb, where t is
continuous time, j is an index for ordered intervals i.e. years, and g(j) is an arbitrary function
estimated via year dummies. The cloglog regression for a discrete-time hazard model is fit via a
generalized linear model
hij=f(Zija+Xijb+Tijg)+eij
where the inverse cloglog function f(x) = 1-exp(-exp(x)) and j indexes time to indicate
that time is measured in discrete intervals. This model is similar to a logit for low-probability
events (as is the case with the hazard of adoption in any given year), as demonstrated by the
comparison of the inverse cloglog and inverse logit functions shown in Figure 1. Hazards of 5
percent are -2.94 on the logit curve and -2.97 on the cloglog curve; hazards of 3 percent are -3.48
on the logit curve and -3.49 on the cloglog curve. At the rate of 1 to 2 percent for the baseline
hazard of adoption of cardiac services in our data, the cloglog and logit models are essentially
indistinguishable.

13

We use hazard models to estimate the risk of a hospital offering a new cardiac service,
alternately diagnostic angiography, PCI, and CABG. Generally, hospitals that offer PCI also
offer diagnostic angiography, and those that offer CABG also offer diagnostic angiography and
PCI (fewer than 12 hospitals per year (0.32%) offered a different mix of services). The primary
independent variables measure the extent to which patients in each observation hospital’s market
already had access to that service and the rate by which the observation hospital’s competitors
adopted a new service. We estimate the following model:
(1)

E(ServiceProvided)it = f [ βo + β1Nit + β2Yt + β3Dit+ β4Hit]

where N are the primary independent variables of interest, including: (1) the percentage
of the population in each observation hospital’s market that already has access to the service in
question in the current year; and (2) the rate at which an observation hospital’s competitors,
defined as all hospitals that also lie within 60 minutes driving time of the observation hospital,
adopt the service in question during the same year. The percentage of the population in each
hospital's market that already has access to a service at a hospital they are likely to visit was
determined by examining zip code tabulation areas within an hour's drive. For each of these
nearby zip codes, we calculate whether hospitals (other than the observation hospital) within a
maximum of sixty minutes of the centroid of that ZCTA offered the service, then computed the
weighted average of that indicator by hospital size and distance to get the zip-code probability of
coverage. We then averaged those zip-code probabilities of coverage, across all zip codes within
an hour of the hospital in question, weighting by population size and distance, to get the
percentage of the nearby population likely to already have access. The rate at which an
observation hospital's competitors adopted the service is an average of nearly hospitals'
indicators, weighted by hospital size and distance. D is a vector of demographic variables for the

14

hospital’s patient market, again defined as all residents of ZCTAs, the centroids of which lie a
maximum of sixty minutes driving time to the centroid of a ZCTA. The demographic variables
are weighted by the size of the ZCTA’s population and driving time from the observation
hospital to the centroid of the ZCTA. We include these measures to account for differences by
demographic status in the demand for invasive cardiac procedures. For example, men, especially
older men, are more likely than women to suffer from cardiovascular disease (Cutler and
Kadiyala, 2003). Education, income, race (being white), and age are all positively correlated
with having health insurance (Smith and Medalia, 2015) and, therefore, variation in these
attributes likely is correlated with geographic differences in the demand for (or profitability of)
services. For similar reasons, we include variables measuring population size, age and sex (by
percentage of the population in the market that is male or female and under 18, between 18 and
44, between 45 and 54, between 55 and 64, and equal to or older than 75), education (percentage
of the population in the market with a high school degree or GED, some college, a college
degree, with a graduate degree), percent income ≥ 100K, the percentage of people on public
assistance, and race (white, black, and other – which included native American, Asian & Pacific
Islander, or mixed race; Hispanic).
Finally, we also measure whether the hospital is in an urban market, meaning the
population density is at least 500 people per square mile. According to the criteria published in
the Federal Register on March 15, 2002 (67 FR 11663), an "urbanized area" consists of densely
settled territory that contains 50,000 or more people, with the "densely settled" criterion referring
to at least 500 residents per square mile. This last variable, an indicator of density of the
population, also effectively adjusts for regional differences in the patient population’s
willingness to drive longer distances.

15

H is a vector of hospital and hospital market variables, including the size of the hospital
measured by quintile of annual admissions, whether the hospital is a teaching hospital (measured
by membership in either of two nonprofit organizations for teaching hospitals) and whether the
hospital is part of a hospital network.
We also measure each observation hospital’s Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) to
account for the concentration of hospitals in each hospital’s observation market, defined as the
sum of squared admission shares over all hospitals within sixty minutes driving time, unweighted
by distance.
Y is a dummy variable for each year of data, to account for the baseline hazard of
adoption in the most flexible nonparametric manner possible.
All standard errors (SE) are clustered at the hospital level. This clustering represents a
conservative approach as to the nature of serial correlation within hospital, as the Maximum
Likelihood Estimator of the discrete-time hazard model does not require a cluster-robust SE to
account for multiple observations per unit of observation, but the cluster-robust SE is robust to
any form of serial correlation.
We then estimate models of the form:
(2)

E(ServiceProvided)it = f[ βo + β1Nit + β2Yt + β3Dit+ β4Hit+ β5Oit]

Equation (2) is the same as equation (1) with the addition of a vector of variables O
which includes indicator variables for nonprofit, for-profit, or government ownership of the
observation hospital. We also interact ownership variables with the variable measuring the
adoption rate of competitor hospitals in the observation hospital’s market.
To investigate the influence of market penetration by organizational form, we estimate
models of the form:

16

(3) E(ServiceProvided)it = f[ βo + β1Nit + β2Yt + β3Dit+ β4Hit+ β5Oit+ β6Mit]
Equation (3) is the same as equation (2) with the addition of M, a variable measuring the
penetration of for-profit ownership in each market. The variable is an indicator variable
representing whether more than 10 percent of the hospitals in a market have for-profit ownership
(the median for-profit penetration across all markets and years is 6 percent, increasing from 5 to
7 percent between 1996 and 2014, and the mean is 13 percent, ranging from 12 in 1996 to 15 in
2014).The for-profit penetration variable is constructed as the average of a for-profit indicator
over all hospitals within an hour drive of each zip code, weighted by distance, then weighted by
population in that zip code and distance to the focal hospital. That is, market penetration is
defined analogously to coverage in the population.
We also include interaction terms for the variable measuring high for-profit markets with
the ownership of the observation hospitals and with the variable measuring the rate at which an
observation hospital’s competitors adopts each service:
(4) E(ServiceProvided)it = f[ βo + β1Nit + β2Yt + β3Dit+ β4Hit+ β5Oit+ β6Mit+ β7MitOit +
β8MitNit]

Results and Limitations
5.1. Unadjusted Results.
From 1997 to 2014, the proportion of hospitals offering invasive cardiac services grew

over the study period (Table 1a). As can be seen in Table 1a, column 1, the proportion of
hospitals not offering any invasive cardiac service declined; as can be seen in the remaining
columns, a lower proportion of hospitals offered only diagnostic angiography over the study

17

period (column 2) and higher percentage offered diagnostic and treatment services (columns 3 &
4).
The rate of new service adoption by hospitals varied by year and by service type,
although the proportion of hospitals newly adopting any of the services declined over the study
period (Table 1b), as the fraction that had not yet adopted fell. The percentage of hospitals that
adopted diagnostic angiography in a year fell from 1997 to 2014, from 5.7 percent to 0.9 percent
of hospitals that did not offer the service in the previous year (Table 1b, Column1). The
percentage of hospitals that adopted PCI fell from 2.0 percent to 1.1 percent of hospitals that did
not previously offer PCI in the previous year (Table 1b, Column 2). The percentage of hospitals
that adopted CABG fell from 1.8 percent to 0.3 percent of hospitals that did not previously offer
CABG (Table 1b, Column 3). Descriptive statistics for all variables are reported in Table 2 for
the samples at risk of adoption (including all years in the risk pool). That is, the samples differ
across columns in Table 1b because the numbers of hospitals yet to adopt a service differ across
service types. Still, we can see that adoption rates are roughly comparable comparing across
columns.
Note that even relatively low adoption rates in one year imply large gains over time in
offering rates. One and half percent of the risk pool adopting in each year (a 1.5 percent constant
hazard) aggregated over 18 years would imply nearly a quarter of the hospitals not offering a
service in the first year offer it by the last. Likewise, a small change in adoption rates can
produce large changes over time, as hazard rates compound. For this reason, we compute
changes in the expected rate of adoption and compare to baseline adoption rates.
5.2. Service Adoption, Geographic Access to Care, and Competitor Behavior.

18

The probability of an observation hospital adopting a new service depends upon
competition through two paths. First, it depends on the degree to which the observation
hospital’s potential patient pool has access to services at another hospital. The potential patients
are the residents of ZCTAs the centroids of which fall a maximum of 60 minutes driving time
from the observation hospital and whether they have access at another hospital is determined by
whether the centroids of the ZCTAs in which they reside are within 60 minutes of another
hospital offering that service. For economy of expression, we describe this variable as the
hospital’s market population already having access to care. Second, it depends on the degree to
which an observation hospital’s competitors also adopt the service in a given year. These two
effects operate in different directions.
Controlling only for the year and demographic and hospital factors listed above, hospitals
generally are more likely to adopt a new service if the populations in their markets already have
access to that service at another hospital (Table 3, columns 1, 4, and 7, coefficients on the
percent of the population with access to each service). To interpret the magnitude of the effects,
we calculated the effect of a 10 percent increase in the percent of each hospital’s market
population who resided in a ZCTA the centroid of which is a maximum of sixty minutes driving
time from another hospital offering the service in question. More specifically, we add
coefficients to the transformed1 baseline hazard in the sample, then retransform to recover an
estimated effect on the hazard for only that coefficient.
The probability of hospitals adding diagnostic angioplasty increases by approximately
0.09 percentage points or slightly over a 4 percent increase in the probability that a hospital

The cloglog transformation of baseline hazard h is –ln[ln(1-h)], whereas the logit transformation is the log
odds ln[(h)/(1-h)]. If we add a coefficient c to the transformed hazard to get y= c –ln[ln(1-h)], we retransform via 1exp[-exp(y)] for the new estimated hazard.

newly adopts diagnostic angioplasty that year (the mean adoption rate in the sample is 2.38
percent per year). The corresponding percentages for PCI are considerably higher—0.63
percentage points or a 29.0 percent increase over a base rate of 2.16 percent per year in the
sample. For CABG the numbers fall in the middle—0.10 percentage points or about a 10.7
percent increase over a base adoption rate of 0.964 percent per year in the sample. However,
only the results for PCI differ statistically from zero.
As can be seen in Table 3 in the coefficients on the adoption rates of competitors for each
service (column 2, 5, 8), hospitals are also quite responsive to the behavior of their competitors
in terms of adopting new services. Hospitals are more likely to adopt a new service if their
competitors also adopt the service in a given year. The magnitudes of these effects are very large
and the coefficients for all three services are significant at the 1 percent level. The magnitude of
the probability of a hospital adding diagnostic angioplasty increases by approximately 3.0
percentage points or about a 127 percent increase in the probability that a hospital newly adopts
diagnostic angioplasty that year (the mean adoption rate is 2.39 percent). The corresponding
percentages for PCI and CABG are even higher: for PCI, an increase of 2.83 percentage points,
or a 133.1 percent increase over a base rate of 2.13 percent; for CABG, 1.79 percentage points or
about a 185 percent increase over a base adoption rate of 0.967 percent.
The two effects operate in opposite directs. Including both measures of percentage of
residents in a hospital’s market area with access to care at competing hospitals and the adoption
behavior of competitors is perhaps most telling. As can be seen in Table 3, columns 3, 6, and 9,
when the adoption rate of competitors is included in the model, the coefficients on the percentage
of the population with access to each service is large, negative, and significant at the 1 percent
level. Hospitals are deterred from offering a new service if the market population already has

20

access to that service elsewhere. However, the coefficients on adoption rates for each service by
competitors of each observation hospital is larger, in regressions adjusting for the percentage of
the population with access elsewhere, than in regressions that do not control for that variable.
These coefficients are also statistically significant at the one percent level.
Estimating the magnitude of these effects together is somewhat complicated because an
increase in the number of competitor hospitals adopting a new service will also increase the
percentage of the population that has geographic access to that service at another hospital.
Nonetheless, to give a sense of the magnitude of the joint effect, we considered the case of a fifty
percent increase in the number of competitors offering a new service. We assumed for the
purposes of the simulation that this increase led to a twenty percent increase in the population
with geographic access to the service, using the observed correlations of adoption and change in
population coverage in our sample.2 Applying these assumptions, the probability of adopting
cardiac angioplasty increases from 2.39 percent to 60.4 percent, for PCI from 2.13 percent to
51.3 percent, and for CABG from 0.97 percent to 81 percent.
5.3 Hospital Ownership and Effects of Ownership Mix in Hospital Markets
Consistent with previous research (Horwitz and Nichols, 2009), for-profit hospitals are
more likely than nonprofit hospitals, which in turn are more likely than government hospitals, to
adopt each of these three relatively profitable cardiac services and the coefficients on ownership
of the observation hospital are all statistically significant at the one percent level (Table 4, rows 1

2

These are large changes in market structure, but not infeasible, as such large changes are observed in only
one to 5 percent of cases in our data, but a typical positive adoption rate is 20 percent (median for diagnostic
angiography, with a 30 percent mean; 13 percent median and 19 percent mean for PCI; and 9 percent median and 15
percent mean for CABG).

21

and 2). Moreover, the magnitude of the effect of ownership of the observation hospital on the
probability of adopting a new service is large.
Based on the coefficients reported in Table 4, column 1, for-profit hospitals are 2.02
percentage points more likely to adopt diagnostic angiography than are nonprofit hospitals; this
represents an 84.3 percent increase in the probability of adoption on a base of 2.39 percent. The
corresponding magnitudes for PCI are a difference of 1.32 percentage points, for an increase of
62.1 percent increase in the probability of adoption on a base of 2.13 percent, comparing forprofit hospitals to nonprofits. For CABG, the difference is 0.85 percentage points, or an 88.3
percent increased hazard, on a base of 0.97 percent.
Government hospitals are less likely to adopt new services than are nonprofit hospitals.
Government hospitals are 0.97 percentage points less likely to adopt diagnostic angiography than
are nonprofit hospitals; this represents a 40.1 percent decrease in the probability of adoption on a
base of 2.39 percent. The corresponding magnitudes for PCI are -0.84 percentage points,point
differential, for a decrease of 39.6 percent in the probability of adoption on a base of 2.13
percent. For CABG, -the difference is 0.58 percentage points, or 60.1 percent decrease on a base
of 0.97 percent.
Table 5 reports the probability of a hospital adopting a new service taking into account
the penetration of for-profit hospitals in the market. When controlling for ownership of
observation hospitals, the coefficients on the variable measuring high for-profit market
penetration are negative, but only the coefficients on CABG are statistically significant. (Table 5,
row 3).
Table 6 reports the results of interactions between an indicator variable for high for-profit
penetration markets and 1) the ownership of observation hospitals, and 2) the adoption rate of

22

their competitors. The results are consistent with previous research demonstrating nonprofit
hospitals are more likely to adopt profitable cardiac services in markets with high for-profit
penetration than in markets with fewer for-profits (Horwitz and Nichols, 2009), effectively
behaving more like for-profits in markets with more for-profit competitors.
The interactions between hospital ownership and the adoption rates of competitors (FP/
Gov * Comp. adopting DxAngio/PCI/CABG), adjusting for the ownership of observation
hospitals and high for-profit penetration in their markets, yields inconclusive results (Table 6).
The only consistently statistically significant results suggest that for profit hospitals are more
likely than nonprofit hospitals to increase the sophistication of their cardiac services as their
competitors start offering invasive cardiac services in the form of diagnostic angiography.3 This
can be seen in columns 3 and 4 (FP*Comp. adopting dxAngio). For-profit hospitals are 4.6
percentage points more likely than nonprofits to adopt PCI if their competitors adopt diagnostic
angiography; this represents a 216 percent increase in the probability of adoption on a base of
2.13 percent. The magnitude of the effect increases when adjusting for the interaction between
the adoption rates of competitors and being in a high for-profit market.
5.4 Limitations
There are several limitations to our study. First, there may be some measurement
error in the service adoption variables. We identify hospitals as offering a service based on
whether a hospital bills (or has billed) for eleven or more procedures on Medicare fee-for-service
beneficiaries. It is possible that a hospital newly offers a service in a given year and provides
fewer than eleven procedures or provides more procedures on patients who are not insured under

3

Compared to nonprofit hospitals, for profit hospitals are less likely to adopt CABG if their competitors do
(column 8; fp*adoption rate of competitors-CABG), but this is no longer statistically significant after adjusting for
being in a for profit market (column 9).

23

the Medicare fee-for-service program. However, patients who receive the services studied here
tend to be old enough to qualify for Medicare. Medicare was the primary expected payer for 51.1
percent of hospital stays involving a cardiac stent insertion procedure in 2009 (Auerbach et. al.,
2012). Over sixty percent of CABG patients are 65 or older (Epstein et. al., 2011; Table 2) and
therefore are old enough to qualify for Medicare. Younger cardiac patients may also be covered
by Medicare. In fact, in 2012, approximately seventeen percent of Medicare beneficiaries who
were under 65 had Ischemic Heart Disease (CMS, 2015).
Nonetheless, hospitals may perform these services on patients insured under the
Medicare Advantage program instead of, or in addition to, those covered by Medicare fee-forservice. However, even those regions with the highest levels of Medicare Advantage enrollment
also have high levels of fee-for-service enrollment. At the end of the study period, in 2014,
thirty percent of Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in Medicare advantage plans, and by 2016
the rate was at least forty percent in five states (Jacobson, 2016). Therefore, even in these high
enrollment states, sixty percent of all enrollees were in fee-for-service plans.
Second, as with any study using observational data, it is not possible to completely
rule out bias due to endogeneity. Our results are consistent with hospitals simultaneously
adopting new services in response to changes in an unobserved common factor driving up the
demand for cardiac services in their markets, rather than in reaction to each other’s decisions.
However, because government reimbursement through Medicare payments accounts for the bulk
of cardiac spending, it is unlikely that differences in market prices account for the differences in
technology diffusion we find here. Moreover, our inclusion of extensive demographic and
hospital control variables—most importantly, variables that control for population growth and

24

changes in the age distribution in the markets—suggest that simultaneous response to demand
shocks does not explain our results.
Following Oster (2017), as an additional robustness test we exclude groups of controls,
alternately excluding: (1) education and income covariates and (2) race covariates, and rerun all the
analyses described above. The coefficients and proportions of variance explained remain stable across
analyses, with the coefficients in these alternate specifications remaining within the range of a single
standard deviation of the specifications reported here (i.e. within one standard error). This exercise
supports the notion that results are robust to the inclusion of multiple varieties of control variables.

Nonetheless, it is possible that we have not measured, yet hospitals observe, changes in the
population of a hospital’s geographic market or other local shocks explain the results we have
found. For example, if the adoption of catheterization labs is promoted by a third party (such as a
stent manufacturer) in an area, or a conference is held in the area that promotes such adoption, all
hospitals would be exposed to a common shock. In this case, adoptions could be correlated for
that reason and not because hospitals are competing against each other. Even if that type of
hypothetical common shock were the cause, however, the pattern of adoption we document is of
direct policy concern, since it results in duplicative services more than increased access, and can
lower welfare relative to a situation where some adoptions of new services are moved from a
service-rich area to a service-poor area.
Third, it may be that hospitals simultaneously adopted new services, not in response to
information that a competitor hospital planned to adopt, but rather in response to changes in the
costs of supplying the service such as a decrease in input prices of the equipment or the
physicians. It is unlikely that such decreases explain the patterns we observe. Over the study
period, the percentage and number of hospitals adopting a new service decreased. And the
patterns of adoption were clustered within markets as defined in this analysis (relatively small

25

areas based on 60 minute driving distances) and were not consistent across the country, whereas
markets for technology or talent are much larger if not national.

Discussion
Between 1996 and 2014, hospitals have continued to adopt new invasive cardiac

services, although the rate of adoption slowed over the study period. Larger hospitals are more
likely to adopt new services than are smaller hospitals. For-profit hospitals are more likely to
adopt new services than are nonprofit hospitals, which, in turn, are more likely than government
hospitals to adopt new services. On average, hospitals appear to make decisions regarding the
adoption of new services based on the behavior of competitors in the markets in which they
operate, controlling for population size and other characteristics.
The welfare effects of our findings regarding cardiac technology diffusion are uncertain.
Although the spread of technology is generally good for social welfare, this has not always been
the case with health care technology. Large geographic differences in the provision of care and
in spending on care cannot be explained by differences in the population treated and have not led
to differences in health outcomes, suggesting that there is a great deal of waste. Cardiac
treatments are typically quite profitable services for hospitals (Horwitz, 2005), and oversupply is
a particular worry for the provision of services that tend to be profitable for providers. In fact, at
the extreme, there have been distressing cases of hospitals and physician providing services,
particularly profitable services such as cardiac treatments, to patients who did not need the
intervention (Eisler and Hansen, 2013; Vrana and White, 2003).
Although our study does not measure social welfare directly, the results suggest that
current patterns of cardiac technology diffusion can either increase or decrease social welfare,
depending on conditions of a health care market. Social welfare is enhanced if hospitals base

26

their decisions to adopt on the existence of unmet medical need in their markets. And, there is
some evidence that they are doing so. They are less likely to adopt a new service if the patients
in their markets already have geographic access to a service at another hospital.
However, previous research finding little increase in geographic access to care suggests
that adoption decisions are in fact driven by a competitor’s decision to adopt (Horwitz et al.
2013). Our results strongly support this finding. Although hospitals respond to the needs of
potential patients to be within sixty minutes driving time of an invasive cardiac service, they also
respond to the behavior of their competitors and adopt even if doing so duplicates existing
services, failing to increase geographic access.
Nonetheless, even if competition has led to inefficient diffusion, there may well be
offsetting benefits to hospital competition. Recent studies have identified benefits to hospital
competition in terms of reducing excess capacity (Santerre and Adams, 2002), prices (Town and
Vistnes, 2001), and adverse outcomes (Kessler and McClellan, 2000). The link between hospitallevel volume and improved patient outcomes implies such effects are unlikely for the cardiac
services in this study, but such effects are outside the scope of this study. Future research should
investigate the relationship among adoption, the role of hospital competition for patients and
services, and outcomes such as health status and spending.
In addition to identifying two mechanisms that may explain a hospital’s decision to adopt
a new service, we find that for-profit hospitals are considerably more likely than nonprofits to
adopt new services. However, this study does not find many differences in the relationship
between ownership and responsiveness to the adoption decisions of competitors.
Despite improvements in treatments, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death
in the United States and has been for many decades, though whether cancer or cardiovascular

27

disease is the leading cause has recently begun to vary by race and socioeconomic status (Heron
and Anderson, 2016). Understanding the continued diffusion of treatments in markets that
already have geographic access may help in addressing this persistent health problem.

Total Number
of Hospitals

Notes: Proportion offering a service is the fraction of hospitals treating cardiac patients that offered a service /total
number of hospitals in the year. A hospital is treated as offering a service if it newly adopted a service in the
observation year or any previous year in the sample. Columns 1-4 may not sum to one due to rounding and due to
hospitals (fewer than 12 per year (0.32%)) offering a different mix of services, such as diagnostic angiography and
CABG but not PCI, or PCI and CABG but not diagnostic angiography.

Medicare beneficiaries (1996-2014).

Notes: Proportion adopting a service is the number of hospitals treating cardiac patients that newly adopted the
service in that year divided by the number of hospitals that did not offer the service the previous year (the risk pool
for adoption). A hospital may only adopt each service once. The denominator differs by service and only includes
hospitals that were in both that year and the previous year (the risk pool must be observed in both years). For
diagnostic angiography the denominator equals the number of hospitals that did not offer any service in the previous
year. For PCI, the dominator equals the number of hospitals that did not offer PCI; the denominator for CABG is
the number of hospitals that did not offer CABG the previous year. A hospital is considered not to have offered a
service in a year if it has not previously adopted the service, not adopted the service in that year, and did not offer
the service in the base year (1996).

Notes: % pop with service access and % pop with demographic characteristics are determined based on the
percentage of the population in each hospital’s market that is in a ZCTA with a centroid ≤ 60 min driving distance to
a hospital with the service or with the characteristic. Adoption rate of competitors = distance and admission
weighted percentage of competitors that adopt a service; hospital sizes based on annual admissions.
