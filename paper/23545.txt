Targeted Debt Relief and the Origins of Financial Distress: Experimental Evidence from Distressed
Credit Card Borrowers
Will Dobbie and Jae Song
NBER Working Paper No. 23545
June 2017
JEL No. D14,J22,J31,K35
ABSTRACT
We study the drivers of financial distress using a large-scale field experiment that offered
randomly selected borrowers a combination of (i) immediate payment reductions to target shortrun liquidity constraints and (ii) delayed debt write-downs to target long-run debt constraints. We
identify the separate effects of the payment reductions and debt write-downs using variation from
both the experiment and cross-sectional differences in treatment intensity. We find that the debt
write-downs significantly improved both financial and labor market outcomes despite not taking
effect for three to five years. In sharp contrast, there were no positive effects of the more
immediate payment reductions. These results run counter to the widespread view that financial
distress is largely the result of short-run constraints.

Financial distress is extraordinarily common in the United States. Over one-third of Americans
have a debt in collections, and more than one in ten will file for bankruptcy at some point during
their lives. Americans are also severely liquidity constrained, with approximately one-quarter of
households unable to come up with $2,000 to cope with an unexpected need (Lusardi, Schneiderm,
and Tufano 2011).1 As a result, there is a widespread view that liquidity constraints are the most
important driver of financial distress and that debt relief will be most effective when it targets these
short-run constraints. This view has important implications for understanding both the growing
level of financial distress in the United States and the optimal design of debt relief programs such
as consumer bankruptcy. In this paper, however, we show that this view significantly overstates the
benefits of debt relief targeting short-run liquidity constraints, while significantly understating the
benefits of debt relief targeting longer-run financial constraints, such as the distortionary effects of
excessive debt (so called “debt overhang”).
Estimating the effects of targeted debt relief is challenging because most debt relief programs
are designed to address both short- and long-run financial constraints at the same time. For
example, consumer bankruptcy protection offers both lower minimum payments (to address shortrun liquidity constraints) and generous debt write-downs (to address longer-run debt overhang).
As a result, standard “black box” estimates of consumer bankruptcy cannot be used to predict
the effects of specific types of targeted debt relief or to understand the relative importance of
addressing short- or long-run financial constraints alone. An added complication is that most debt
relief recipients are negatively selected, biasing cross-sectional comparisons, and many of the most
proximate causes of debt relief receipt, such as job loss and expense shocks, also impact later
outcomes, biasing within-individual comparisons.
In this paper, we overcome these challenges using information from a randomized field experiment matched to administrative tax, bankruptcy, and credit records. The experiment was designed
and implemented by a large non-profit credit counseling organization in the context of an important but under-studied debt relief program called the Debt Management Plan (DMP). The DMP
is a structured repayment program that allows distressed borrowers to simultaneously repay all
of their outstanding credit card debt over a three to five year period. In exchange for enrolling
in a DMP, credit card issuers will lower the minimum payment amount at the beginning of the
repayment program (to address short-run liquidity constraints) and provide a partial write-down
1
An additional 19 percent of households could only come up with $2,000 by pawning or selling possessions or
taking out a payday loan (Lusardi, Schneider, and Tufano 2011). There is also evidence that many households have
a high marginal propensity to consume out of both transitory income shocks (e.g., Johnson, Parker, and Souleles
2006, Parker et al. 2013) and new liquidity (e.g., Gross and Souleles 2002, Agarwal, Souleles, and Liu 2007, Agarwal
et al. 2015, Gross, Notowidigdo, and Wang 2016), and recent work shows large changes in financial distress and
consumption just after anticipated reductions in mortgage interest rates (e.g., Di Maggio, Kermani, and Ramcharan
2014, Keys et al. 2014, Fuster and Willen 2015). There is also an important literature showing that present-biased
preferences can potentially explain both low levels of liquidity and the use of high-cost credit (e.g., Laibson 1997,
Heidhues and Kőszegi 2010, Meier and Sprenger 2010, Laibson et al. 2017). See DellaVigna (2009) and Zinman
(2015) for reviews of the literature on present-biased preferences and liquidity constraints, respectively. Evidence on
longer-run problems such as debt overhang is more limited, although recent work shows that debt overhang can affect
a household’s labor supply (Bernstein 2016), entrepreneurial activity (Adelino, Schoar, and Severino 2013), and home
investment (Melzer forthcoming).

of interest payments and late fees at the end of the repayment program (to address longer-run debt
overhang). Each year, more than 600,000 individuals repay between $1.5 and $2.5 billion credit
card debt through these repayment programs (Wilshusen 2011).
During the experiment, borrowers in both the treatment and control groups were offered a repayment program. While control borrowers were offered the status quo repayment program that
had been offered to all borrowers prior to the randomized trial, treated borrowers were offered a
much more generous repayment program that included a combination of two different types of targeted debt relief: (i) immediate minimum payment reductions meant to address short-run liquidity
constraints and (ii) delayed debt write-downs meant to address longer-run debt overhang. The
additional debt relief provided by the experiment was substantial: the typical minimum payment
reduction for the treatment group was just over $26 (6.15 percent) per month larger than those
in the status quo program, while the typical debt write-down in the treatment group was $1,712
(49.17 percent) larger than those in the status quo program. The economic magnitudes of the
payment reductions and debt write-downs in the treatment group were also relatively similar, at
least as measured by the net present costs of providing the debt relief (approximately $440 for the
typical borrower).
We identify the separate impact of the debt write-downs and minimum payment reductions
using variation from both the randomized experiment and cross-sectional differences in treatment
intensity. Each of the credit card issuers participating in the randomized trial offered a different
combination of debt write-downs and minimum payment reductions to treated borrowers, and
individual borrowers made different decisions about how much to borrow from each of these credit
card issuers before the experiment began. These decisions translated into economically significant
differences in the debt write-downs and minimum payment reductions offered to the treatment
group. For example, treated borrowers at the 75th percentile of the debt write-down distribution
received write-downs that were $1,521 larger than treated borrowers at the 25th percentile of
the distribution. Similarly, treated borrowers at the 75th percentile of the minimum payment
distribution received payment reductions that were $33 per month larger than treated borrowers
at the 25th percentile of the distribution. The interaction of the randomized experiment and these
cross-sectional differences in treatment intensity allows us to isolate the effects of the payment
reductions and debt write-downs in the treatment group.
To see the intuition for our approach, imagine a group of borrowers with a low debt writedown intensity and a low minimum payment intensity, and a second group of borrowers with a
high debt write-down intensity but the same low minimum payment intensity. In this scenario,
we can isolate the impact of a larger debt write-down at the margin by comparing the effect of
the randomized treatment eligibility for the low debt write-down intensity borrowers to the effect
of treatment eligibility for the high write-down intensity borrowers. We can similarly isolate the
causal impact of the minimum payment reductions at the margin by comparing the effects of
treatment eligibility for borrowers with different minimum payment intensities but identical debt
write-down intensities. Our approach builds on identification strategies commonly used in studies

2

of local labor markets, immigration, and trade, which exploits the combination of state- or citylevel variation in potential treatment intensity and national-level variation in treatment status (e.g.,
Bartik 1991, Blanchard and Katz 1992, Card 2001, Autor, Dorn, and Hanson 2013). In contrast to
these earlier studies, however, we use individual-level differences in treatment status determined by
random assignment, and individual-level differences in potential treatment intensity determined by
decisions made without knowledge of the experiment. As a result, our research design is robust to
many of the potential concerns that typically arise from these types of instruments (e.g., GoldsmithPinkham, Sorkin, and Swift 2017).
We begin our analysis by estimating the effect of treatment eligibility on repayment, bankruptcy,
collections debt, credit scores, employment, and savings. These intent-to-treat effects measure the
impact of both the debt write-downs and minimum payment reductions. We find that treatment eligibility increased the probability of finishing the repayment program and decreased the probability
of filing for bankruptcy, particularly for the highest-debt borrowers. We also find that treatment
eligibility decreased the probability of having collections debt for high-debt borrowers. There were
no detectable effects of treatment eligibility on labor market outcomes or 401k contributions for
either high- or low-debt borrowers, although large standard errors mean that we cannot rule out
modest treatment effects in either direction.
Next, we estimate the separate impact of the minimum payment reductions and debt writedowns. We find that the debt write-downs significantly improved both financial and labor market
outcomes despite not taking effect until three to five years after the experiment. For the highest-debt
borrowers, the median debt write-down in the treatment group increased the probability of finishing
a repayment program by 1.62 percentage points (11.89 percent) and decreased the probability of
filing for bankruptcy by 1.33 percentage points (9.36 percent). The probability of having collections
debt also decreased by 1.25 percentage points (3.19 percent) for these high-debt borrowers, while
the probability of being employed increased by 1.66 percentage points (2.12 percent). The estimated
effects of the debt write-downs for credit scores, earnings, and 401k contributions are smaller and
not statistically significant. Taken together, however, our results indicate that there are significant
benefits of debt relief targeting long-run debt overhang in our setting.
In sharp contrast, we find no positive effects of the minimum payment reductions targeting
short-run liquidity constraints. There was no discernible effect of the payment reductions on completing the repayment program, with the 95 percent confidence interval ruling out treatment effects
larger than 0.15 percentage points in the pooled sample. The median payment reduction in the
treatment group also increased the probability of filing for bankruptcy in this sample by a statistically insignificant 0.70 percentage points (6.76 percent) and increased the probability of having
collections debt by a statistically significant 1.40 percentage points (3.56 percent). There are also
no detectable positive effects of the payment reductions on credit scores, employment, earnings, or
401k contributions. In sum, there is no evidence that borrowers in our sample benefited from the
minimum payment reductions, and even some evidence that borrowers seem to have been hurt by
these reductions.

3

We show that these null results can be explained by the unintended, negative effect of increasing
the number of months a borrower remains in the repayment program. The payments reductions
increased the length of the repayment program in the treatment group by an average of four months
and, as a result, increased the number of months where a treated borrower could be hit by an adverse
shock that causes default (e.g., job loss). We find that the positive effects of increased liquidity in
the treatment group were nearly exactly offset by the negative effects of this increased exposure to
default risk. These results help to reconcile our findings the vast literature documenting liquidity
constraints in a variety of settings (e.g., Gross and Souleles 2002, Johnson, Parker, and Souleles
2006, Agarwal, Souleles, and Liu 2007, Parker et al. 2013, Agarwal et al. 2015, Gross, Notowidigdo,
and Wang 2016), while indicating that the potential benefits of targeting these short-run constraints
may have been significantly overstated, at least in our setting.
Our results contribute to an emerging literature estimating the “black box” effects of consumer
bankruptcy protection, which, as mentioned above, addresses both short- and long-run financial
constraints at the same time. Consistent with our findings, bankruptcy protection increases postfiling earnings and decreases both post-filing mortality and financial distress (Dobbie and Song 2015,
Dobbie, Goldsmith-Pinkham, and Yang forthcoming). There is also evidence that the availability of
consumer bankruptcy as an outside option provides implicit health (Gross and Notowidigdo 2011,
Mahoney 2015), consumption (Dobbie and Goldsmith-Pinkham 2014), and mortgage insurance (Li,
White, and Zhu 2011). However, none of these papers are able to identify the effects of targeting
either short-run liquidity constraints or long-run debt overhang alone.
This paper is also related to recent work estimating the effects of debt relief in the mortgage
market. Mortgage modifications made through the HAMP program modestly decreased both mortgage and non-mortgage defaults, although it is unclear whether the effects were driven by lower
minimum payments or lower debt burdens (Agarwal et al. 2012). More recent work suggests that
the principal write-downs made through HAMP had no impact on underwater borrowers (Ganong
and Noel 2017), while both cross-sectional regressions and theoretical work suggest that principal
forgiveness may be effective for non-underwater borrowers (Haughwout, Okah, and Tracy 2010,
Eberly and Krishnamurthy 2014).2 While our results are broadly consistent with this literature,
we caution against generalizing our results to the mortgage market. It is possible, for example, that
liquidity constraints may be more important in the mortgage market, where delinquent borrowers
often have fewer outside options than otherwise similar credit card borrowers.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section I describes the institutional setting
and experimental design. Section II provides a simple conceptual framework for interpreting the
experimental results. Section III describes our data and empirical design. Section IV presents our
main results of how the randomized experiment impacted repayment, bankruptcy, financial health,
employment, and savings. Section V explores potential mechanisms, and Section VI concludes.

Related work shows that anticipated mortgage interest rate reductions decrease mortgage defaults and increase
non-durable consumption (e.g., Di Maggio, Kermani, and Ramcharan 2014, Keys et al. 2014, Fuster and Willen
2015), although it is unclear whether these effects are driven by a lower minimum payment or a lower debt burden.

I. Background and Experimental Design
A. Background
The randomized experiment described in this paper was implemented and designed by Money
Management International (MMI), the largest non-profit credit counseling agency in the United
States. In the early 1950s, the first non-profit credit counseling organizations were established to
increase credit card repayment rates and decrease the number of new bankruptcy filings. Today,
non-profit credit counseling organizations such as MMI provide a wide range of services to its
clients via phone and in-person sessions, including credit counseling, bankruptcy counseling, and
foreclosure counseling.
One of the most important products offered by non-profit credit counselors is the debt management plan (DMP), a structured repayment program that simultaneously repays all of a borrower’s
outstanding credit card debt over three to five years.3 Under the DMP, the credit counseling agency
negotiates directly with each of the borrower’s credit card issuers to lower the minimum payment
amount (to address short-run liquidity constraints) and partially write-down interest payments and
late fees (to address longer-run debt overhang). In most cases, credit card issuers will also agree to
stop recording the debt as delinquent on the borrower’s credit report. Compared to making only
the minimum payment on a credit card, enrolling in a DMP will reduce the average borrower’s
monthly payments by about 10 to 15 percent and reduce the total cost of repayment by about
20 to 40 percent. Following the negotiations with the credit card issuers, the borrower makes one
monthly payment to the credit counseling agency that is disbursed to his or her creditors according
to the terms of the restructured agreements. The minimum monthly payment for each credit card
account is typically about two to three percent of the original balance, although borrowers can
make additional payments to reduce the length of the repayment program. In our sample, the
average minimum monthly payment for the control group is 2.38 percent of the original balance,
or about $437, and the average length of the repayment program is 52.7 months.
Creditors will usually allow borrowers to resume the repayment program if they miss just one or
two payments. However, if a borrower misses too many payments or withdraws from the program,
the remaining credit card debt is usually sent to collections. At this point, either the original credit
card issuer or a third-party debt collector will use a combination of collection letters, phone calls,
wage garnishment orders, and asset seizure orders to collect the remaining debt. Borrowers can
make these collection efforts more difficult by ignoring collection letters and calls, changing their
telephone number, or moving without leaving a forwarding address. Borrowers can also leave the
formal banking system to hide their assets from seizure, change jobs to force creditors to reinstate
a garnishment order, or work less so that their earnings are not subject to garnishment. Most
borrowers also have the option of discharging the remaining credit card debt through the consumer
3

Under current regulatory guidelines, the term length for a DMP cannot exceed five years. If borrowers cannot
fully repay their credit card debts within this five-year limit, they cannot participate in a DMP unless the creditor is
willing to write off a portion of the original balance and recognize the loan as impaired. To date, however, creditors
have typically been unwilling to do this (Wilshusen 2011).

bankruptcy system. In all of these scenarios, however, borrowers’ credit scores are likely to be
adversely affected, at least in the short run.
To help ensure that creditors benefit from their participation in the repayment program, the
counseling agency screens potential clients to assess whether the borrower has a sufficient cash
flow to repay his or her debts over the three to five year period of the repayment program, but
not enough to reasonably repay his or her debts without the repayment program. In practice,
potential clients who pass this screening process have similar credit scores and financial outcomes
as bankruptcy filers, but more adverse outcomes than the typical credit user in the United States
(e.g., Dobbie et al. forthcoming). Historically, credit card issuers have given credit counseling
agencies the incentive to effectively screen potential clients through a combination of monitoring
and the fair share payments discussed above. To strengthen the counseling agencies’ incentive to
effectively screen clients, many credit card issuers also condition their payments to the counseling
agency on the borrower’s completion of the repayment program (Wilshusen 2011).4
The participation of the credit card issuers in a DMP is voluntary, and card issuers may choose
to participate in only a subset of the DMPs proposed by the credit counseling agencies. In principle,
a credit card issuer will only participate in a repayment program if doing so increases the expected
repayment rate, presumably because the borrower is less likely to default or file for bankruptcy
(Wilshusen 2011). Consistent with this view, individuals enrolled in a DMP are less likely to file
for bankruptcy (Staten and Barron 2006) and less likely to report financial distress (O’Neill et al.
2006) than observably similar individuals who are not enrolled in a DMP. Credit card issuers can
also directly refer borrowers to a credit counseling agency if the risk of default or bankruptcy is
particularly high. In our sample, approximately 15.5 percent of individuals report that they learned
about MMI from a card issuer. In comparison, 33.7 percent of individuals in our sample report
that they learned about MMI from an internet search, 19.8 percent from a family member or friend,
and 20.0 percent from a paid advertisement.
Each year, MMI administers over 75,000 DMPs that repay nearly $600 million in unsecured debt.
Nationwide, it is estimated that non-profit credit counselors administer approximately 600,000
DMPs that repay credit card issuers between $1.5 and $2.5 billion each year (Hunt 2005, Wilshusen
2011).
B. Experimental Design
Overview: In 2003, MMI and eleven large credit card issuers agreed to offer more generous minimum payment reductions and debt write-downs to a subset of borrowers interested in a structured
repayment program. The purpose of the experiment was to evaluate the effect of more generous
debt relief on repayment rates, particularly for the most financially distressed borrowers.
4
The costs of administering the DMP are covered by a small administrative fee of about $10 to $50 paid by the
borrower and these larger “fair share” payments paid by the credit card issuers. Fair share payments have become
somewhat less generous over time, falling from an average of twelve to fifteen percent of the recovered debt in the
1990s to about five to ten percent of the recovered debt today (Wilshusen 2011). To the best of our knowledge, both
the fair share payments and administrative fees remained relatively constant throughout the experiment.

6

The resulting randomized experiment was conducted between January 2005 and August 2006.
The experimental population consisted of the near universe of prospective clients that contacted
MMI during this time period. There were two main restrictions to the experimental sample. First,
the experiment was restricted to individuals contacting MMI for the first time during this time
period; individuals who had already enrolled in a DMP before January 2005 were excluded from the
randomized trial. Second, the experiment was restricted to individuals assigned to counselors with
more than six months of experience. In total, the experimental sample included 79,739 borrowers
assigned to 709 different counselors.
Sequence of the Experiment: First, each prospective client was randomly assigned to a credit
counselor conditional on the contact date, the individual’s state of residence, and the reference
channel (i.e. web versus phone). For each counselor, the MMI computer system would automatically
switch from the control group repayment program to the treatment group repayment program
every two weeks. This automated rotation procedure was meant to ensure that experimental
protocols were followed by the counselors and that any counselor-specific effects would not bias the
experiment. The rotation procedure was also staggered across counselors so that, on any given day,
approximately 50 percent of individuals were assigned to the treatment group and approximately
50 percent were assigned to the control group. Counselors were strictly instructed not to inform
prospective clients of the experiment, and a senior credit counselor conducted frequent audits of
the counselors to ensure that the experimental protocols were followed and that the treatment
and control populations remained of relatively similar sizes during the experiment. MMI worked
with the participating credit card issuers to design the automated rotation procedure, but none of
the card issuers were directly involved with the implementation of the experiment or the auditing
process.
Following the assignment of an individual to a credit counselor, the assigned counselor collected
information on the prospective client’s unsecured debts, assets, liabilities, monthly income, monthly
expenses, homeownership status, number of dependents, and so on. Identical information was
collected from both the treatment and control groups, and there was no indication of treatment
status communicated to individuals. Using the information collected by the counselor, the MMI
computer system would then calculate the individual-specific terms of the repayment program,
including the minimum payment amount, the length of the program, and the total financing fees.
These terms depended on the amount of debt with each credit card issuer and whether the individual
was assigned to the treatment or control group.
Next, the credit counselor would explain the individual’s options for repaying his or her debts.
The details of this process closely followed MMI’s usual procedures and were identical for the
treatment and control groups. In most cases, the repayment options were explained in the following
way. First, individuals were told that they could liquidate their assets and repay their debts
immediately, although relatively few individuals in our sample had enough assets to make this a
viable option. Next, individuals were told that they could file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which
would allow them to discharge their unsecured debts and avoid debt collection in exchange for any
7

non-exempt assets and the required court fees. Third, individuals were told what would happen
if they continued paying only the minimum payment on their credit cards. In a representative
call provided to the research team, the MMI counselor explained that “if you continue making the
minimum payment of $350, it will take you 348 months to repay your credit cards and you will have
to spend about $21,300 in financing charges.” Finally, individuals were told about the benefits of
enrolling in a structured repayment program. In the same representative call, the MMI counselor
explained that if the individual enrolled in a DMP, her payments would “drop to $301, you would
repay all of your credit cards in 56 months, and only have $3,800 in financing charges. That is a
savings of about $17,500.”
Finally, the individual would indicate whether he or she wished to enroll in the offered repayment
program following the counselor’s explanation of the repayment options. Individuals could also call
back at a later date to enroll in the repayment program under the same terms.
Treatment Intensity: Table 1 illustrates how the experiment impacted the typical borrower’s repayment program. Each row presents DMP terms for a hypothetical borrower with the control
mean for credit card debt acquired before the experiment ($18,212). We first calculate the DMP
terms for this hypothetical borrower as if he or she had been assigned to the control group, i.e.
using the control means for the both minimum payment requirement (2.38 percent of initial debt)
and the implied interest rate (8.50 percent). For this hypothetical borrower, the control repayment
program requires making minimum payments of $433.45 for 50.05 months, with $3,482 in financing
fees.
Next, we recalculate the DMP terms for this hypothetical borrower using the median debt
write-down in the treatment group (a 3.69 percentage point decrease in the implied interest rate),
holding the minimum payment percentage constant. The median debt write-down in the treatment
group decreases these financing fees by $1,712, or 49.17 percent, by dropping the last four payments
of the borrower’s repayment program. However, the debt write-down does not affect the borrower’s
minimum payment amount. As a result, the debt write-down will only increase enrollment in the
repayment program if borrowers value debt forgiveness at the end of the repayment program, about
three to five years in the future.
Finally, we recalculate the DMP terms using the median minimum payment reduction in the
treatment group (a 0.14 percentage point decrease in the minimum payment percentage), holding
fixed the debt write-down amount. The median minimum payment reduction in the treatment
group decreases the typical borrower’s minimum payment by $26.68, or 6.15 percent, by adding
an additional four months to the repayment program. The longer repayment period also increases
the financing fees by $289, or 8.30 percent. Thus, the minimum payment reductions may decrease
liquidity-based defaults at the beginning of the repayment program by lowering the minimum
payment amount and increase defaults at the end of the repayment program by mechanically
increasing the exposure to default risk.
Variation in Treatment Intensity: As discussed above, an important feature of the experiment
8

is the significant cross-sectional variation in potential treatment intensity (see Appendix Figure
1). To illustrate the economic significance of this variation, we recalculate the DMP terms using
debt write-downs and minimum payment reductions at different points in the treatment intensity
distribution. The difference between the 25th percentile and 75th percentile debt write-downs
within the treatment group is roughly equivalent to the difference between the median control
group write-down and the median treatment group write-down ($1,521 versus $1,712). Similarly, the
difference between the 25th percentile and 75th percentile minimum payment reductions within the
treatment group is slightly larger than the difference between the median control group reduction
and the median treatment group reduction ($33 per month versus $26 per month).
These cross-sectional differences in treatment intensity are driven, in part, by each of the credit
card issuers offering a different combination of debt write-downs and minimum payment reductions
to treated borrowers. Appendix Table 1 lists the treatment and control group offers for each of
the eleven credit card issuers participating in the experiment. There were seven different combinations of the debt write-downs and minimum payment reductions offered to treated borrowers,
with considerable variation in the approaches taken by each credit card issuer. For example, one
of the credit card issuers offered the largest debt write-down (a 9.9 percentage point decrease in
the implied interest rate) and no minimum payment reduction to treated borrowers, while another
offered the largest minimum payment reduction (a 0.5 percentage point decrease in the minimum
payment percentage) and the smallest debt write-down (a 4.0 percentage point decrease in the
implied interest rate). While there are no records explaining why the credit card issuers offered
the combinations of treatments that they did, MMI believes that these decisions were driven by
the idiosyncratic views of individual employees at each credit card issuer. Consistent with this
explanation, there are no systematic patterns between the generosity of the debt write-downs and
minimum payment reductions offered before the experiment and the generosity of the treatments
during the experiment.
The cross-sectional differences in treatment intensity are also driven by individual borrowers
making different decisions about how much to borrow from each of the credit card issuers before
the experiment began. Importantly, we do not assume that these borrowing decisions are random. As will be discussed below, the key identifying assumption for our approach is that potential
treatment intensity is not correlated with the potential benefits of the debt write-downs and minimum payment reductions. We view this assumption as reasonable given that there was no way
for individuals to know which credit card issuers would offer which debt write-down and minimum
payment treatments, and therefore no reason to believe that the differences in potential treatment
intensity will be correlated with the unobserved benefit of the experimental treatments. We will
also provide direct support for our identifying assumption below.
Treatment Costs: Table 1 also provides cost estimates for the median debt write-downs and minimum payment reductions in the treatment group. We use the control mean for the monthly default
rate during the repayment program (1.12 percent) to capture the mechanical default risk associated
with a shorter or longer repayment program. As the costs of the debt write-downs and minimum
9

payment reductions in the treatment group are realized at different points in the repayment program (i.e. the end of the repayment program versus throughout the entire repayment program), we
present estimates using discount rates of 0.0 percent, 8.5 percent (the control mean interest rate),
and 20 percent (a typical interest rate in the credit card market).
The discounted costs of the median debt write-down and median minimum payment reduction in
the treatment group are nearly identical ($440 versus $444) with a 20 percent discount rate. Under
an 8.5 percent discount rate, however, the cost of the median debt write-down in the treatment
group is over double the cost of the median minimum payment reduction in the treatment group
($802 versus $332), with even larger differences at lower discount rates. As discussed above, this
is because the costs of the debt write-downs and minimum payment reductions in the treatment
group are realized at different points in the repayment program. Nevertheless, we interpret these
calculations as suggesting that the experiment provides a reasonably “fair” comparison of the two
different types of debt relief.
C. External Validity
In this section, we discuss how the details of the experimental design may affect the externality
validity of our results.
Framing Effects: As discussed above, MMI emphasized the monthly payment amount, time to
repayment, and financing fees when explaining the repayment program to both the treatment and
control groups during the experiment. While the internal validity of the experiment is not affected
by these details of the experimental design, it is possible that the effects of the debt write-downs
and minimum payment reductions are mediated by these institutional details. For example, it is
possible that emphasizing the monthly payment amount increases the perceived value of a minimum
payment reduction. It is also possible that emphasizing financing fees, rather than the total amount
of debt repaid, either increases or decreases the perceived value of a debt write-down. Importantly,
however, these experimental procedures closely followed both MMI’s usual procedures and the way
in which the write-downs and payment reductions would be implemented at scale through a typical
DMP. Our estimates therefore measure the impact of targeted debt relief in one of the most policyrelevant contexts. Nevertheless, all of our results should be interpreted with these potential framing
effects in mind.
Non-Linear Treatment Effects: Another potential concern is that we estimate the impact of debt
write-downs and minimum payment reductions at the margin of an existing debt relief program,
making it impossible to estimate the impact of the first dollar of a debt write-down or the first dollar
of a payment reduction using our experimental data. We also do not observe the kind of extremely
large debt write-downs or minimum payment reductions needed to estimate, for example, a nearly
complete write-down of the original balance. As a result, out-of-sample predictions based on our
experimental estimates will be biased if there is a non-linear effect of either the debt write-downs
or the minimum payment reductions.
10

To shed some light on this issue, Appendix Figure 2 presents non-parametric estimates of the
debt write-downs and minimum payment reductions in our experiment. We estimate these nonparametric treatment effects by grouping our treatment intensity measure into equally-sized bins
for both the debt write-downs and minimum payment reductions (see Section III.C for details of the
empirical specification and treatment intensity measure). We report the interaction of treatment
eligibility and each treatment intensity bin, controlling for both treatment intensity and the state
by reference group by date fixed effects that account for the stratification used in the randomization
of individuals to counselors. We also plot the OLS best-fit line weighted by the standard error for
each point estimate. The results are consistent with linear treatment effects over the range of
treatment intensities observed in our data. Of course, we cannot test whether there are non-linear
effects for treatment intensities that we do not observe in the data.

II. Conceptual Framework
In this section, we develop a stylized model to motivate our empirical analysis and to clarify how
the reduced form parameters we estimate should be interpreted. We focus exclusively on the broad
role of short-run liquidity constraints and longer-run debt overhang, abstracting from other drivers
of financial distress such as job loss or health shocks.5 Using the model, we show that backloaded debt write-downs have a positive impact on repayment due to a decrease in forward-looking
defaults at the beginning of the experiment and a decrease in exposure-related defaults at the end
of the experiment. In contrast, more immediate minimum payment reductions have an ambiguous
impact due to offsetting effects on liquidity-based defaults at the beginning of the experiment and
exposure-related defaults at the end of the experiment.
A. Model Setup
We omit individual subscripts from the model parameters to simplify notation. Individuals are risk
neutral and maximize the present discounted value of disposable income at a subjective discount
rate β. In each period t, individuals receive earnings yt = µ+t , where  are i.i.d. shocks drawn from
a known mean zero distribution f () and µ is assumed to be both known and positive. Following
the structure of the repayment program we study, debt payments begin at t = 0 and are set at a
constant level d for length P , so that dt = d for t ≤ P and dt = 0 for t > P .
In each time period 0 ≤ t ≤ P , individuals observe their income draw yt and decide whether
to make the required debt payment d or default on the remaining debt payments. If an individual
5

We also do not attempt to model every possible mechanism through which liquidity constraints and debt overhang
affect financial distress. The conclusions we draw in this section should be interpreted with these modeling choices in
mind. Our model is related to a large literature examining the causes and consequences of individual default using
quantitative models of the credit market. For example, see Chatterjee et al. (2007) for a general model of consumer
default and Benjamin and Mateos-Planas (2014) for a model that distinguishes between formal and informal consumer
default. Our model is also related an emerging literature that estimates the separate impact of different forms of
hidden information and hidden action. See Adams, Einav, and Levin (2009) and Karlan and Zinman (2009) for
examples of these approaches using observational and experimental data, respectively.

defaults on the remaining payments in period t for any reason, she loses her current income draw yt
and receives a constant amount x in period t and all future time periods. To capture the idea of a
potentially binding liquidity or credit constraint, we assume that individuals automatically default
if net income yt − dt falls below threshold v , regardless of the value of future cash flows.
Let V q (t, y) denote the continuation value of making repayment decision q in period t given
income draw y. For periods 0 ≤ t < P , the continuation value of default V d (t, y) is equal to the
discounted value of receiving x in both the current period and all future periods:
V d (t, y) =

x
1−β

(1)

The continuation value of repayment V r (t, y) consists of the contemporaneous value of repayment
y − d and the option value of being able to either repay or default in future periods:

The contemporaneous value of repayment y − d is unaffected by the time period t, while the
option value of continuing repayment, and hence the total value of continuing repayment, is weakly
increasing in t for t < P . This is because the option value of repayment increases as individuals
become closer to the “risk-free” time periods after the completion of the repayment program.
Repayment and default behavior is described by a path of cutoff values φt , where an individual defaults if yt < φt . The default cutoff φt combines the optimal strategic response of liquid
individuals to low income draws and the non-strategic response of illiquid individuals based on v
that may or may not be optimal. Following the above logic, the strategic default cutoff is weakly
decreasing over time, reflecting the decreased incentive to default as individuals’ remaining loan
balances shrink. Appendix A provides additional details on the above results.
B. Model Predictions
Motivated by the experiment, we consider the comparative statics of debt write-downs and minimum payment reductions on repayment rates.
Debt Write-Down Prediction: In the model, back-loaded debt write-downs increase repayment
rates through two complementary effects: (1) a forward-looking debt overhang effect that decreases
the treatment group’s incentive to strategically default while both treatment and control groups
are enrolled in the repayment program and (2) a mechanical exposure effect that decreases the
treatment group’s exposure to default risk while the control group is still enrolled in the repayment
program and the treatment group is not.
Proof – See Appendix A.
To see the intuition for this result, recall that the debt write-downs forgive treated borrowers’
monthly payments at the end of the repayment program. As a result, the debt write-downs will
12

increase repayment rates through a forward-looking debt overhang effect if borrowers value debt
forgiveness three to five years in the future. The mechanical exposure effect is driven by the fact
that, conditional on enrolling in the repayment program, the debt write-downs make it impossible
for treated borrowers to default when their payments have been forgiven.
Formally, let dW D and P W D denote the monthly payment amount d and repayment period P
for the debt write-down group W D, and dC and P C denote the monthly payment amount and
repayment period for the control group C. We model the debt write-downs as reducing the overall
cost of the debt by shortening the repayment period for the treatment group, P W D < P C , without
changing the monthly payments dW D = dC = d. In this context, the forward-looking debt overhang
channel is driven by the fact that for 0 ≤ t ≤ P W D , shortening the length of the repayment period
brings individuals in any given period P C −P W D periods closer to finishing the repayment program,
increasing the expected value of continuing the repayment program. This increase in the expected
value of repayment decreases the strategic, forward-looking default cutoff for liquid individuals
during this time period. However, disposable income for 0 ≤ t ≤ P W D remains the same, so there
is no difference in the probability that an individual defaults due to the liquidity constraint v during
this time period. In other words, there will only be an increase in repayment for 0 ≤ t ≤ P W D if
the forward-looking default cutoff is the relevant margin for at least some individuals.
The mechanical exposure effect is driven by the fact that, for P W D < t ≤ P C , default rates
mechanically drop to zero for the treatment group as they have completed the repayment program.
However, the control group can still default on their debt if either the liquidity-based or forwardlooking cutoffs bind over this time period. The debt write-downs can therefore increase repayment
rates even if individuals never strategically default (i.e. if individuals only default due to a binding
liquidity constraint) if there is sufficient default risk at the end of the repayment program.
Minimum Payment Prediction: The minimum payment reductions have an ambiguous impact
on repayment rates in the model due to three different effects: (1) a liquidity effect that decreases
the treatment group’s probability of non-strategic or liquidity-based default while both the treatment and control groups are enrolled in the repayment program, (2) a second liquidity effect that
ambiguously changes the treatment group’s incentive to strategically default while both the treatment and control groups are enrolled in the repayment program, and (3) a mechanical exposure
effect that increases the treatment group’s exposure to default risk while the treatment group is
still enrolled in the repayment program and control group is not.
Proof – See Appendix A.
To see the intuition for this result, recall that the minimum payment reductions reduce treated
borrowers’ minimum payment by increasing the length of the repayment program. In the model,
the minimum payment reductions therefore decrease liquidity-based defaults at the beginning of
the repayment program through the lower required payments, but increase defaults at the end of
the repayment program through the increased exposure to all forms of default risk. The minimum payment reductions also change the option value of repayment, and hence the incentive to
13

strategically default. The direction of this “indirect” liquidity effect is ambiguous, as the minimum
payment reductions both increase future flexibility and transfer a portion of the debt burden into
the future.
Formally, let dM P and P M P denote the monthly payment d and repayment period P for the
minimum payment group M P . We model the minimum payment reductions as a lengthening of the
repayment period from P C to P M P > P C that keeps the total sum of the monthly payments the
P C
P MP
same Pt=0 dt = Pt=0 dt . The first liquidity effect is driven by the fact that the minimum payment
reductions decrease the probability that the non-strategic cutoff binds for illiquid individuals for
0 ≤ t ≤ P C , increasing repayment rates over this time period if the liquidity-based default cutoff
is the relevant margin for at least some individuals.
The second liquidity effect is due to the indirect effect of the minimum payment reductions
on the incentive to strategically default for 0 ≤ t ≤ P C . The direction of this indirect effect
is ambiguous, as the minimum payment reductions both decrease per-period repayment costs,
increasing the option value of repayment, and increase the number of periods to repay, decreasing
the option value of repayment. These opposing effects on the option value of repayment are not
unique to minimum payment reductions; other policies that target liquidity constraints such as
payment deferrals or higher credit limits will also exhibit these kinds of opposing effects. We
therefore think of the liquidity effect as including both the direct effects on liquidity-based defaults
discussed above and the indirect effects on the option value of repayment discussed here. We assume
throughout that the liquidity effect net of these two channels is positive, although our results do
not rely on this assumption.
Following the discussion for the debt write-down prediction, the mechanical exposure effect is
driven by the fact that, for P C < t ≤ P M P , default rates mechanically drop to zero for the control
group, while the treatment group can still default on their debt if either the liquidity-based or
strategic cutoffs bind over this time period. This exposure effect allows for the possibility that the
minimum payment reductions will have a negative effect on repayment rates.

III. Data and Empirical Design
A. Data Sources and Sample Construction
To estimate the impact of the randomized experiment, we match counseling data from MMI to
administrative bankruptcy, credit, and tax records. This section describes the construction and
matching of each dataset.
The counseling data provided by MMI include information on all prospective clients eligible
for the randomized trial. The data include detailed information on each individual’s unsecured
debts, assets, liabilities, monthly income, monthly expenses, homeownership status, number of
dependents, treatment status, enrollment in a repayment program, and completion of a repayment
program. The data also include information on the date of first contact, state of residence, who
referred the individual to MMI, the assigned counselor, and an internal risk score that captures the

14

probability of finishing a repayment program. We normalize the risk score to have a mean of zero
and standard deviation of one in the control group and top-code all other continuous variables at
the 99th percentile.
We use the data provided by MMI to calculate potential treatment intensity for each individual
in our sample. Recall that there is significant variation in potential debt write-downs and minimum
payment reductions as a result of the participating issuers offering different concessions to treated
borrowers. To measure this variation in treatment intensity, we first calculate the write-downs and
minimum payments for all individuals as if they had been assigned to the control group and as
if they had been assigned to the treatment group. In this step, we use the exact calculation that
MMI uses, repeating this calculation under both the control and treatment scenarios. We then
calculate the difference between the control write-downs and the treatment write-downs (in terms
of the implied interest rate) for each individual, and the control minimum payment and treatment
minimum payment (in terms of percent of the original balance) for each individual. These writedown and minimum payment differences are our individual-level measures of potential treatment
intensity. Importantly, we observe virtually all of the same information that MMI uses to calculate
the terms of the structured repayment program.6
Information on bankruptcy filings comes from individual-level PACER bankruptcy records. The
bankruptcy records are available from 2000 to 2011 for the 81 (out of 94) federal bankruptcy courts
that allow full electronic access to their dockets. These data represent approximately 87 percent of
all bankruptcy filings during our sample period.7 We match the credit counseling data to PACER
data using name and the last four digits of the social security number. We assume that unmatched
individuals did not file for bankruptcy protection during the sample period, and control for state
fixed effects in all specifications to account for the fact that we do not observe filings in all states.
We also pool Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 filings throughout the analysis. Results are similar if we
limit the sample to borrowers living in states with PACER data coverage.
Information on collections debt and credit scores come from individual-level credit reports from
TransUnion (TU). The TU data are derived from public records, collections agencies, and trade
lines data from lending institutions. The collections data contain information on any unpaid bills
that have been sent to collection agencies, including the date of collections and the current amount
owed. The credit score we use is calculated by TU to predict the probability that a consumer
will become delinquent on a new loan within the next 24 months. Since credit scores are used in
the vast majority of lending decisions, improvements in credit scores should directly translate into
increased credit availability, lower interest rates, or both (e.g., Dobbie et al. 2016). TransUnion
was able to successfully match 89.7 percent of the credit counseling data to the credit bureau data.
The probability of being matched to the credit report data is not significantly related to treatment
6

Specifically, we have information on interest rates and minimum payments for the nineteen largest creditors in
the sample, including all eleven of the credit card issuers participating in the experiment. For the 16.7 percent of
debt held by smaller creditors not participating in the experiment, we assume an interest rate of 6.7 percent and
a minimum payment of 2.25 percent. These assumptions follow MMI’s internal guidelines for calculating expected
DMP payments. Our results are robust to a wide range of alternative assumptions.

15

status (see Panel C of Table 2). No personally identifiable information (“PII”) were provided to us
by TransUnion.
Information on formal sector labor market outcomes and 401k contributions comes from administrative tax records from the SSA. The SSA data are available from 1978 to 2013 for every
individual who has ever acquired an SSN, including those who are institutionalized. Information
on annual earnings, employment, and 401k contributions come from annual W-2s.8 The earnings
and employment variables include all formal sector earnings, but do not include earnings from the
informal sector. The 401k variable includes all conventional, pre-tax contributions, but does not
include contributions to Roth accounts. Individuals with no W-2 in any particular year are assumed
to have had no earnings or 401k contributions in that year. Individuals with zero earnings or zero
401k contributions are included in all regressions throughout the paper. We match the credit counseling data to the tax data using the full social security number. We are able to successfully match
95.3 percent of the counseling data to the SSA data. The probability of being matched to the SSA
data is also not significantly related to treatment status (see Panel C of Table 2).
We make two sample restrictions to the final dataset. First, we drop individuals that are not
randomly assigned to counselors because they need specialized services such as bankruptcy counseling or housing assistance. Second, we drop individuals with less than $850 in unsecured debt or
more than $100,000 in unsecured debt to minimize the influence of outliers. These cutoffs correspond to the 1st and 99th percentiles of the control group, respectively. The resulting estimation
sample consists of 40,496 individuals in the control group and 39,243 individuals in the treatment
group. Our sample for the labor market and 401k outcomes is further restricted to 76,008 individuals matched to the SSA data and our sample for the collections debt and credit score outcomes is
further restricted to the 71,516 individuals matched to the TU data.
B. Descriptive Statistics and Experiment Validity
Table 2 presents descriptive statistics for the treatment and control groups. The average borrower
in our sample is just over 40 years old with 2.15 dependents. Thirty-six percent of borrowers are
men, 63.5 percent are white, 17.2 percent are black, and 8.9 percent are Hispanic. Forty-one percent
are homeowners, 44.1 percent are renters, and the remainder live with either a family member or
friend. The typical borrower in our data has just over $18,000 in unsecured debt, with about $9,600
of that debt being held by a credit card issuer participating in the randomized experiment. Monthly
household incomes average about $2,450, and monthly expenses average about $2,150.
Panel B of Table 2 presents baseline outcomes for the year before contacting MMI. Not surprisingly, individuals in our sample are severely financially distressed before contacting MMI. Baseline
credit scores in our sample are about 585 points, with 25.3 percent of individuals in our sample
having nonzero collections debt. In comparison, the typical bankruptcy filer has a credit score of
8

The SSA data also include information on mortality and Disability Insurance receipt. Very few individuals in
our data die or receive Disability Insurance during our sample period and estimates for these outcomes are small and
not statistically different from zero.

16

630 points, with 29.6 percent of filers having nonzero collections debt (Dobbie et al. forthcoming).
Individual earnings in the SSA data are approximately $23,500, slightly lower than the self-reported
household earnings reported in the MMI data. These results suggest that either some individuals
in our sample are not the sole earner in the household, that some individuals have earnings in the
informal sector not captured by the SSA data, or that there is an upward bias in the self-reported
earnings. Eighty-five percent of borrowers in our sample are employed in the formal sector at
baseline according to the SSA data. Baseline bankruptcy rates are very low, 0.3 percent, likely because individuals are unlikely to contact a credit counselor if they have already received bankruptcy
protection. Finally, baseline 401k contributions are $373 for borrowers in our sample.
Panel D of Table 2 presents measures of potential treatment intensity calculated using the MMI
data. Specifically, we calculate the implied interest rate, the minimum payment percentage, and
the program length in months for each borrower as if they had been assigned to the control group
and as if they had been assigned to the treatment group (see Section III.A for details). As would
be expected given the random assignment, the treatment and control groups have similar potential
program characteristics. If assigned to the control group, the typical treated borrower would have
had an implied interest rate of 8.5 percent, a minimum payment of 2.4 percent of the initial balance,
and a program length of just over 52.6 months. Similarly, the typical control borrower actually had
an implied interest rate of 8.4 percent, a minimum payment of 2.4 percent of the initial balance,
and a program length of about 52.7 months. If assigned to the treatment group, those same control
borrowers would have had an implied interest rate of 6.0 percent, a minimum payment of 2.3
percent of the initial balance, and a program length of 51.9 months, nearly exactly the program
characteristics that the treatment group actually had.
Column 3 of Table 2 tests for balance. We report the difference between the treatment and
control group controlling for state by reference group by date fixed effects – the level at which
prospective clients were randomly assigned to counselors. Standard errors are clustered at the
counselor level. The means of all of the baseline and treatment intensity variables in Panels A-D are
similar in the treatment and control groups. Only one of the 24 baseline differences is statistically
significant at the ten percent level and the p-value from an F-test of the joint significance of all of
the variables listed is 0.807, suggesting that the randomization was successful.
Panel E of Table 2 presents measures of the actual program characteristics offered to borrowers
in the treatment and control groups (i.e. the “first stage” of the experiment). Consistent with
the results from Panel D, treated borrowers have implied interest rates that are 2.6 percentage
points lower than control borrowers, minimum payments that are 0.1 percentage points lower, and
program lengths that are 0.8 months shorter.

17

C. Empirical Strategy
Intent-to-Treat Estimates: We begin our empirical analysis by estimating the impact of treatment
eligibility using the following reduced form specification:
yit = α0 + α1 T reati + α2 Xi + ηit

(3)

where yit is the outcome of interest for individual i in year t, T reati is an indicator variable equal to
one if individual i was assigned to the treatment group, and Xi is a vector of state by reference group
by date fixed effects that account for the stratification used in the randomization of individuals to
counselors. We also include the individual controls listed in Table 2 and cluster the standard errors
at the counselor level in all specifications. Estimates without individual controls are available in
Appendix Table 2.
Estimates of α1 measure the causal impact of being offered a more generous repayment program
on subsequent outcomes. However, two important issues complicate the interpretation of these
intent-to-treat estimates. First, treated borrowers were offered a repayment program that included
a combination of both the debt write-downs and minimum payment reductions. Thus, the intentto-treat estimates measure the combined effect of both forms of debt relief and do not allow us to
identify the separate impact of debt relief addressing short-run liquidity constraints and debt relief
addressing longer-run debt overhang.
The second issue is that the intent-to-treat estimates understate the true impact of targeted
debt relief because of the substantial cross-sectional variation in treatment intensity in our sample.
For example, over 25 percent of borrowers in our sample had no credit card debt with the eleven
credit card issuers participating in the experiment and, as a result, were offered the status quo,
or “control” repayment program even when they were assigned to the treatment group. In total,
nearly 90 percent of borrowers received a less intensive treatment than originally intended because
they had at least some credit card debt with a non-participating issuer.
Isolating the Effects of Debt Write-Downs and Minimum Payment Reductions: We identify the
separate impact of the debt write-downs and minimum payment reductions using variation from
both the randomized experiment and the cross-sectional differences in treatment intensity. Recall
that we can measure individual-level treatment intensities by using the detailed data from the
non-profit credit counselor to calculate the difference between each borrower’s hypothetical control
and hypothetical treatment repayment program offers. We can then isolate the effects of the debt
write-downs and minimum payment reductions by comparing the effects of treatment eligibility
across borrowers with higher and lower treatment intensities.
To see the intuition for our approach, imagine a group of borrowers with a low debt write-down
intensity and a low minimum payment intensity, and a second group of borrowers with a high debt
write-down intensity but the same low minimum payment intensity. For the first group of borrowers,
the intent-to-treat estimates from Equation (3) measure the impact of a low-intensity change in
both the debt write-down and minimum payment amount. For the second group of borrowers,
18

however, the intent-to-treat estimates measure the impact of a high-intensity change in the debt
write-down and a low-intensity change in the minimum payment amount. Our approach isolates
the impact of a larger debt write-down at the margin by comparing the intent-to-treat estimates for
the low debt write-down intensity borrowers to the intent-to-treat estimates for the high write-down
intensity borrowers. We similarly isolate the causal impact of the minimum payment reductions at
the margin by comparing the effects of treatment eligibility for borrowers with different minimum
payment intensities but identical debt write-down intensities.
Formally, we define the potential debt write-down and minimum payment treatment intensities
as the difference between hypothetical treatment and hypothetical control repayment program
offers:
T
∆W riteDowni = W riteDownC
i − W riteDowni
T
∆P aymenti = P aymentC
i − P aymenti

where ∆W riteDowni is the percentage point difference between the control interest rate W riteDownC
i
and treatment interest rate W riteDownTi for borrower i, and ∆P aymenti is the percentage point
difference between the control minimum payment percentage P aymentC
i and treatment minimum
payment percentage P aymentTi .
Using these individual-level measures of potential treatment intensity, we estimate the separate
effects of the debt write-downs and minimum payment reductions using the following reduced form
specification:
yit = β0 + β1 T reati · ∆W riteDowni + β2 T reati · ∆P aymenti
+ β3 ∆W riteDowni + β4 ∆P aymenti + β5 Xi + εit (4)
We control for any independent effects of ∆W riteDowni and ∆P aymenti because the variation in
these measures may reflect unobserved borrower characteristics that have an independent impact
on future outcomes yit . For example, it is possible that the decision to borrow from card issuers
with particularly high ∆W riteDowni or ∆P aymenti is correlated with risk aversion or financial
sophistication. As will be clear below, our approach does not assume that these treatment intensities are randomly assigned. Rather, we assume that the interaction between treatment eligibility
and potential treatment intensity is conditionally random once we control for ∆W riteDowni and
∆P aymenti . Following the intent-to-treat results, we also control for the variables listed in Table

19

2 and cluster the standard errors at the counselor level.9,10
Estimates of β1 and β2 measure the separate effect of being offered the debt write-downs and
minimum payment reductions by comparing the impact of the randomized experiment across borrowers that differed in their potential treatment intensities. Our interpretation of the estimates
relies on two main assumptions.
Our first assumption is that treatment eligibility is, in fact, random.

As with any non-

experimental design, our estimates will be biased if treatment eligibility is correlated with unobserved determinants of future outcomes εit . However, this assumption is almost certainly satisfied
in our setting, as treatment eligibility is randomly assigned by the non-profit credit counselor. To
partially test this assumption, Appendix Table 4 presents summary statistics separately by treatment intensity bins and Appendix Table 5 presents results from a series of OLS regressions of
each baseline variable on the interaction of treatment eligibility and potential treatment intensity.
There are no statistically significant relationships between our baseline measures and the interaction of treatment eligibility and potential treatment intensity, suggesting that the randomization
was successful within treatment intensity bins.11
Our second identifying assumption is an exclusion restriction that the interaction of treatment
eligibility and potential treatment intensity only impacts borrower outcomes through an increase
in actual treatment intensity. This identifying assumption would be violated if potential treatment
intensity is correlated with treatment effect heterogeneity.12 For example, our estimates would
be biased if individuals with a higher local average treatment effect (LATE) to debt relief were
more likely to borrow from card issuers offering the more intensive debt relief. In this scenario,
our estimates would include both the true effect of the more intensive debt relief and systematic
treatment eligibility x issuer “effects” from the sorting of borrowers with higher LATEs to creditors
with the more intensive debt relief. Recall, however, that individuals chose their credit cards many
9

Equation (4) implicitly assumes that there are no direct effects of treatment eligibility and that the effects of
the the debt write-downs and minimum payment reductions are linear and additively separable. Consistent with the
first assumption, our reduced form results are unchanged when we add an indicator for treatment eligibility. The
coefficient on the indicator for treatment eligibility is also small and not statistically different from zero. To partially
test the assumption of linear and additively separable treatment effects, Appendix Table 3 presents non-parametric
estimates using bins of treatment intensity that do not rely on any functional form assumptions. The results are
broadly consistent with linear and additively separable treatment effects, although large standard errors make a
precise test of these assumptions impossible.
10
We include all borrowers – including those with no debts with creditors participating in the experiment – when
estimating Equation (4) in order to identify the strata fixed effects. Results are similar if we restrict our sample to
individuals with at least one debt with a participating creditor.
11
Appendix Table 6 describes the correlates of potential treatment intensities. Borrowers with larger potential debt
write-downs are less likely to be black, more likely to be homeowners, and have higher baseline earnings. Borrowers
with larger potential minimum payment reductions are also less likely to be black, are at lower risk of default as
measured by MMI’s standardized risk score, and have lower baseline earnings. Not surprisingly, borrowers with more
debt with participating issuers also have larger potential treatment intensities.
12
Our second identifying assumption would also be violated if measurement error in the potential treatment
intensity variables, ∆W riteDowni and ∆P aymenti , is correlated with unobserved determinants of future outcomes,
εit . For example, our estimates would be biased upwards if we systematically overestimate the potential treatment
intensity of borrowers who are most likely to repay their debts even in the absence of the treatment. Fortunately,
we use a nearly identical set of information as the non-profit organization to calculate potential treatment intensity,
making it unlikely that there is significant enough measurement error to bias our estimates.

20

years before the experiment was conducted, and there was no way for them to know which credit
card issuers would offer which debt write-downs and minimum payment reductions to the treatment
group during the experiment. There is therefore no reason to believe that potential treatment
intensity will be correlated with the unobserved benefit of the targeted debt relief. As discussed
above, we also see no systematic relationship between the payment reductions and debt write-downs
offered during the experiment and the payment reductions and debt write-downs offered prior to
the experiment.
To partially test the exclusion restriction, Appendix Table 7 examines the robustness of our
results to the inclusion of creditor-specific and demographic-specific treatment effects. Panel A
of Appendix Table 7 presents estimates of Equation (4) with additional controls for treatment
eligibility interacted with an exhaustive set of credit card issuer indicator variables that are set
equal to one if a borrower has nonzero debt with that credit card issuer. Panel B presents estimates that instead add controls for treatment eligibility interacted with indicator variables for
gender, race, baseline homeownership, baseline credit scores, baseline employment, and baseline
401k contributions. Panel C presents estimates that include both the treatment eligibility x credit
card issuer variables and treatment eligibility x baseline demographic variables. Consistent with
our identifying assumption, our main results are generally robust to the inclusion of treatment
eligibility x credit card issuer effects, treatment eligibility x baseline demographic effects, and both
treatment eligibility x issuer and treatment eligibility x baseline demographic effects. In a series
of F-tests of the joint significance of the treatment eligibility x issuer and treatment eligibility x
baseline demographic effects, we also find that these interactions are, with two exceptions, not
statistically significant. The exceptions are the interactions with baseline 401k and employment
measures, which are individually significant in the employment and 401k outcomes regressions,
leading to joint significance for those specifications. Taken together, however, we interpret these
results as indicating that our exclusion restriction is likely to hold in our setting.
Subgroup Analyses: We are interested in how the effects of the experiment vary across borrower
characteristics such as gender, race, and baseline homeownership, credit scores, employment, and
savings. However, we are likely to find a number of statistically significant estimates purely by
chance when performing multiple hypothesis tests. We were also unable to specify a pre-analysis
plan, as the experiment was designed and implemented by MMI, not the research team. In our
main analysis, we therefore restrict ourselves to the single subgroup analysis suggested by the
experimental design: high and low levels of financial distress just prior to contacting MMI. In the
original experimental design, the new debt relief was only going to be offered to the most financially
distressed borrowers. Following the experiment, many of the credit card issuers also offered more
borrower-friendly terms to the most financially distressed borrowers. To test how the effects of the
experiment differ on this dimension, we estimate effects separately for borrowers with below and
above median debt-to-income. Results are similar if we split borrowers by debt amount or by the
predicted probability of default.

IV. Results
A. Debt Repayment
Table 3 presents estimates of the impact of being offered the debt write-downs and minimum
payment reductions on starting and completing a structured repayment program over about the
next five years. Panel A reports intent-to-treat estimates of the impact of treatment eligibility.
Panel B reports the coefficient on treatment eligibility interacted with the potential percentage
point change in the implied interest rate and treatment eligibility interacted with the potential
percentage point change in the required minimum payment (multiplied by 100). All specifications
control for potential treatment intensity, the baseline controls listed in Table 2, and strata fixed
effects. Standard errors are clustered at the counselor level throughout.
Intent-to-Treat Results: There is an economically and statistically significant effect of treatment
eligibility on starting and completing the repayment program. Treatment eligibility increased the
probability of starting a repayment program by 1.86 percentage points, a 5.84 percent increase from
the control mean of 31.85 percent. The probability of finishing a repayment program also increased
by 1.31 percentage points, a 9.59 percent increase from the control mean of 13.66 percent. In total,
treatment eligibility increased the amount of debt repaid by 1.54 percentage points, a 7.71 percent
increase from the control mean of 19.97 percent (see Appendix Table 8).
The effects of treatment eligibility are considerably larger for borrowers with above median
baseline debt-to-income, a proxy for financial distress. Treatment eligibility increased the probability of starting a repayment program by 1.42 percentage points more for borrowers with above
median debt-to-income compared to borrowers with below median debt-to-income. The probability
of finishing the repayment program also increased by 3.08 percentage points more for borrowers
with above median debt-to-income. These results suggest that, consistent with the priors of MMI
and the credit card issuers, the effects of the more generous debt relief was substantially larger for
financially distressed borrowers.
Appendix Tables 9-14 present selected subsample results by gender, ethnicity, baseline homeownership, baseline employment, baseline 401k contributions, and baseline credit scores. For each
of these subgroups, there are no clear theoretical predictions as to which group will benefit most
from the experiment. We find larger intent-to-treat effects for borrowers with higher baseline credit
scores, but similar results by gender, ethnicity, and baseline homeownership, employment, and 401k
contributions.
Debt Write-Down Results: Consistent with the intent-to-treat estimates discussed above, we find
that the debt write-downs had an economically large impact on repayment rates in the treatment
group. The median debt write-down in the treatment group (i.e. a 3.69 percentage point implied
interest rate reduction) increased the probability of starting a structured repayment program by
1.88 percentage points, a 5.88 percent increase from the control mean. The probability of finishing
the program also increased by 1.62 percentage points, an 11.89 percent increase from the control
22

mean, and the percent of debt repaid increased by 1.81 percentage points, a 9.06 percent increase.
To better understand these treatment effects, Figure 1 plots the actual control mean and the
treatment group means implied by estimated treatment effects at each percentile of debt repayment.
Specifically, we calculate the treatment group means by adding the reduced form effect of the median
debt write-down in the treatment group to the control mean. We therefore calculate treatment
group means at each percentile using control group means at each percentile and reduced form
estimates from Equation (4), where the dependent variable is an indicator for repaying at least
that percent of debt through the repayment program. The shaded region indicates the 95 percent
confidence intervals with standard errors clustered by counselor. Figure 1 shows that effect of the
debt write-downs also remains roughly constant throughout the repayment program. It is also
worth noting that both treatment and control borrowers exit the repayment program at high rates,
with only 13.66 percent of the control group completely repaying their debts. In Section V, we will
discuss what mechanisms are most consistent with these patterns.
As with the intent-to-treat estimates, the effects of the debt write-downs are driven by borrowers
with above median debt-to-income. For these high debt-to-income borrowers, the median writedown in the treatment group increased the probability of starting a repayment program by 2.84
percentage points, an 8.89 percent change, and increased the probability of finishing a repayment
program by 2.51 percentage points, a 16.91 percent change. In comparison, there are no statistically
significant effects of the debt write-downs on borrowers with below median debt-to-income.
An important question is whether the treatment effects discussed above justify the costs of the
write-downs. The average borrower in the control group repays 19.97 percent of his or her debt
through the structured repayment program, while the median write-down in the treatment group
increases the percent of debt repaid increased by 1.81 percentage points. These results imply that
lenders will benefit from offering the debt write-downs so long as repayment rates outside of the
DMP are less than about 10-15 percent. Unfortunately, these outside repayment rates are not in
our data. Credit card issuers participating in the experiment suggested that the average repayment
rate for similar borrowers ranged from 6.5 percent to 14.5 percent during our sample period. If
the marginal rates of repayment are below those average rates, this suggests that the write-downs
would pass a cost-benefit calculation from the lenders’ perspective.
Minimum Payment Results: In sharp contrast to the debt write-down results, we find no effect
of the minimum payment reductions on repayment. The point estimates for both starting and
completing a repayment program are small and not statistically different from zero, with the 95
percent confidence intervals ruling out treatment effects larger than 0.24 percentage points for
starting a repayment program and 0.15 percentage points for completing a repayment program.
Figure 1 shows that these results hold over every percentile of repayment. We also find no effect of
lower minimum payments for borrowers with above or below median debt-to-income or among any
of the other subsample groups we consider in Appendix Tables 9-14.
As discussed above, the null effect of the minimum payment reductions is surprising given a
large and influential literature documenting liquidity constraints and present-biased preferences
23

in a number of otherwise similar settings. Our reduced form results suggest that either liquidity
constraints are not an important driver of borrower behavior in our data, or that a lower minimum
payment is an ineffective way to alleviate these issues, at least in our setting. We return to this
issue in Section V.
B. Bankruptcy
Table 4 presents results for bankruptcy filing in the first five years following the experiment, an
important outside option for borrowers in our sample. MMI discusses both the costs and benefits of
bankruptcy with prospective clients and 10.36 percent of the control group files for bankruptcy in
the first five years following the experiment. Bankruptcy allows most borrowers to discharge their
unsecured debts in exchange for either their non-exempt assets or the partial repayment of debt.
Bankruptcy filings are reported on a borrower’s credit report for seven to ten years, potentially
decreasing access to new credit (Liberman forthcoming) and new employment opportunities (Bos,
Breza, and Liberman 2015, Dobbie et al. 2016). However, conditional on filing, there is evidence
that bankruptcy protection improves recipients’ labor market outcomes, health, and financial wellbeing (Dobbie and Song 2015, Dobbie et al. forthcoming). In our setting, we interpret bankruptcy
as an alternative and potentially more costly form of debt forgiveness and debt restructuring.
Intent-to-Treat Results: In the pooled sample, treatment eligibility decreased the probability of
filing for bankruptcy protection by a statistically insignificant 0.30 percentage points over the first
five years following the experiment. Consistent with the repayment results, however, the effects are
larger and more statistically significant for borrowers with above median debt-to-income. For these
high debt-to-income borrowers, treatment eligibility reduced the probability of filing for bankruptcy
by 1.13 percentage points, a 7.98 percent decrease from the control mean. The effects of treatment
eligibility on bankruptcy are larger in the third year following the experiment (see Appendix Table
15) and prior to the 2005 Bankruptcy Reform that increased the financial and administrative
costs of filing for bankruptcy protection (see Appendix Table 16), although neither difference is
statistically significant due to large standard errors.
Debt Write-Down Results: The effects of treatment eligibility on bankruptcy filing are again driven
by the debt write-downs. Over the first five years following the experiment, the median write-down
in the treatment group decreased the probability of filing for bankruptcy by 0.99 percentage points
in the pooled sample, a 9.61 percent decrease from the control mean of 10.36 percent. The decrease
in bankruptcy filing is again driven by changes in the second and third post-experiment years for
the pooled sample, and the point estimates are again larger prior to the 2005 Bankruptcy Reform.
However, neither difference is statistically significant due to large standard errors.
Consistent with the earlier results, we also find larger effects for borrowers with above median
debt-to-income levels. The median write-down in the treatment group decreased the probability
of filing for bankruptcy by 1.33 percentage points for these high debt-to-income borrowers, a 9.36

24

percent decrease from the control mean. The effects for borrowers with below median debt-toincome are much smaller, although relatively large standard errors mean that the difference is
not statistically significant (p-value = 0.152). The bankruptcy effects are also somewhat larger
for female and non-white borrowers, though again neither difference is statistically significant (see
Appendix Tables 9-14).
Minimum Payment Results: Over the first five years following the experiment, the median minimum payment reduction in the treatment group actually increased the probability of filing for
bankruptcy by a statistically insignificant 0.70 percentage points, with slightly larger point estimates for borrowers with above median debt-to-income. In Appendix Table 15, we show that
there are statistically significant increases in the probability of filing in the fifth post-experiment
year, suggesting that lower minimum payments may exacerbate financial distress at the end of the
repayment program, perhaps due to a longer repayment period.
C. Collections Debt and Credit Score
Table 5 presents results for average collections debt and credit scores over the first five years following the experiment, both important proxies for financial distress and access to credit. In theory,
the experiment could either improve borrowers’ financial health by increasing debt repayment and
decreasing collections activity, or have no impact if the experiment crowds out other debt payments.
Intent-to-Treat Results: In the pooled sample, there are no statistically or economically significant
effects of treatment eligibility on collections debt or credit scores. Consistent with our earlier
results, however, we find statistically significant results for borrowers with above median debtto-income. For these high debt-to-income borrowers, treatment eligibility reduced the probability
of having nonzero collections debt by 0.76 percentage points, a 2.4 percent decrease from the
control mean, and increases credit scores by 3.2 points. Also consistent with our earlier results, the
treatment effects are similar by gender, ethnicity, and baseline homeownership, employment, 401k
contributions, and credit scores.
Debt Write-Down Results: The effects of treatment eligibility on financial distress are again driven
by the debt write-downs. Over the first five years following the experiment, the median write-down
in the treatment group decreased the probability of having nonzero collections debt by 1.25 percentage points in the pooled sample, a 3.19 percent decrease from the control mean of 10.36 percent.
The median write-down in the treatment group also increases credit scores for borrowers with both
below and above median debt-to-income, although neither estimate is statistically significant.
In Appendix Table 8, we show that the median debt write-down in the treatment group also
decreases the probability of a serious credit delinquency by 1.29 percentage points, a 2.60 percent
decrease, and credit card utilization by 1.43 percentage points, a 3.08 percent decrease. There
are no discernible effects of the write-downs on credit card balances or the probability of having
an automobile or mortgage loan, however. Taken together with our collections and credit score
25

estimates, these results suggest that the debt write-downs modestly improved borrowers’ financial
health.
Minimum Payment Results: Following the repayment and bankruptcy results, the median minimum
payment reduction in the treatment group increased the probability of having nonzero collections
debt by a statistically significant 1.40 percentage points, a 3.56 percent increase from the control
mean, with similar point estimates for borrowers with below and above median debt-to-income.
There are also modest decreases in credit scores, particularly for high debt-to-income borrowers.
Finally, we find modest increases in the probability of a serious credit delinquency and decreases in
automobile lending (see Appendix Table 8). These results are all consistent with lower minimum
payments having no positive effects and perhaps even exacerbating financial distress.
D. Labor Market Outcomes
Table 6 presents results for average employment and earnings over the first five years following the
experiment. The experiment could affect labor market outcomes through a number of different
channels. For example, enrollment in the repayment program could increase labor supply by decreasing the frequency of wage garnishment orders that occur when an employer is compelled by a
court order to withhold a portion of an employee’s earnings to repay delinquent debt. The experiment could also impact labor market outcomes through its effects on credit scores (e.g., Herkenhoff
2013, Bos et al. 2015, Herkenhoff and Phillips 2015, Dobbie et al. 2016) or productivity (e.g.,
Mullainathan and Shafir 2013).
Intent-to-Treat Results: There are no effects of treatment eligibility on employment or earnings for
either the pooled sample or the sample of borrowers with above median debt-to-income. We also
find similar (null) effects among all subsamples.
Debt Write-Down Results: The estimated effect of the debt write-downs on employment and earnings is also small and imprecisely estimated in the pooled sample. The 95 percent confidence
interval for the employment effect ranges from -0.61 to 0.83 percentage points, while the 95 percent
confidence interval for the earnings effect ranges from -$643 to $355. The effect of the write-downs
on employment is larger for borrowers with above median debt-to-income, although the effect on
earnings remains small and imprecisely estimated. For these high debt-to-income borrowers, the
median write-down in the treatment group increased average employment by 1.70 percentage points,
a 2.17 percent increase from the control mean.
Consistent with our earlier results, we find similar labor market effects by gender, ethnicity, and
homeownership. However, Appendix Table 12 reveals contrasting labor market effects by baseline
employment status. In unreported results, the debt write-downs also decreased annual earnings
by $2,077 for borrowers who were not employed in the year prior to the experiment, while having
essentially no effect on borrowers employed at baseline. The employment effects are also negative
for nonemployed borrowers, but the point estimate is not statistically significant. These subsample
26

results suggest that the kind of debt forgiveness provided by the write-downs may decrease labor
supply for borrowers most on the margin of any work.
In contrast to the relatively modest labor market effects documented here, Dobbie and Song
(2015) find that Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection increases annual earnings by $5,562 and annual
employment by 6.8 percentage points. These contrasting results are most likely due to differences
in the intensity of the debt relief provided by consumer bankruptcy and our experiment. Chapter
13 bankruptcy, for example, provides a write-down of approximately 80 to 85 percent of the typical
filer’s unsecured debt. Conversely, the median write-down in the treatment group forgives about
9.63 percent of unsecured debt. In addition, Chapter 13 bankruptcy protects future wages from
garnishment, while our experiment did not.
Minimum Payment Results: The estimated effect of the minimum payment reductions on labor
market outcomes is small and relatively imprecisely estimated across all borrowers, including those
who were not employed at baseline. In the pooled sample, the 95 percent confidence interval for
the employment effect ranges from -1.38 to 0.26 percentage points, and from -$437 to $566 for the
earnings effect. None of the estimates suggest economically meaningful effects of a lower minimum
payment on labor market outcomes.
E. 401k Contributions
Table 7 presents results for average 401k contributions, a proxy for savings, over the first five years
following the experiment. In theory, the experiment could either crowd out savings by increasing
the returns of debt repayment, or increase savings by decreasing financial distress and increasing
employment and earnings.
Intent-to-Treat Results: There are no effects of treatment eligibility on 401k contributions in either
the pooled sample or the sample of borrowers with above median debt-to-income. We also find
similar (null) effects by gender, ethnicity, and baseline homeownership credit scores.
Debt Write-Down Results: Consistent with the intent-to-treat estimates, the estimated effect of the
debt write-downs on 401k contributions is small and imprecisely estimated in the pooled sample,
with the 95 percent confidence interval ranging from -$49.20 to $10.09 for the median write-down in
the treatment group. We find similar (null) effects by baseline financial distress, gender, ethnicity,
and homeownership. Consistent with our labor market results, however, we find in unreported
results that the write-downs decreased 401k contributions by $60.14 for nonemployed borrowers. We
also find similar results for borrowers with zero 401k contributions at baseline. These results suggest
that the debt forgiveness provided by the debt write-downs may decrease savings for borrowers most
on the margin of work, and hence most on the margin of contributing to a 401k.
Minimum Payment Results: The estimated effect of the minimum payment reductions on 401k
contributions is statistically zero in both the pooled and subsample results, with the 95 percent

27

confidence interval ranging from -$12.04 to $42.84 for the median minimum payment reduction for
the pooled sample.
F. Robustness Checks
We have run regressions with a number of outcomes and subsamples. The problem of multiplicity
can lead one to incorrectly reject some null hypothesis purely by chance. To test the robustness
of our results, we calculate an alternative set of p-values for our full sample results using a nonparametric permutation test. Specifically, we create 1,000 “placebo” samples where we randomly
re-assign treatment status to individuals within the randomization strata. We then calculate the
fraction of treatment effects from these 1,000 placebo samples that are larger (in absolute value)
than the treatment effects from the true sample.
Appendix Table 17 presents p-values from this non-parametric permutation test. We find
that our main results are robust to this alternative method of calculating standard errors. If
anything, we obtain smaller p-values from the non-parametric permutation procedure than implied
by conventional standard errors. Results are similar for borrowers with above median debt-toincome, our preferred subsample split.

V. Mechanisms
In this section, we consider the potential mechanisms that can explain our debt write-down and
minimum payment results using the economic model developed above.
A. Overview
In theory, the debt write-downs can impact repayment through a forward-looking effect on debt
overhang and a mechanical exposure effect. An important implication of our model is that we
can use treatment effects at the beginning and end of the repayment program to test the relative
importance of these competing channels. Specifically, the model implies that we can test for
forward-looking effects using debt write-down treatment effects early in the repayment program
when both the debt write-down and control groups are still making payments. This is because
the debt write-downs do not affect the minimum payment requirements early in the repayment
program, leaving forward-looking behavior as the only explanation for any debt write-down effects
early in the program. Then, because the total debt write-down estimate includes the effects of
both channels, we can estimate the exposure effect alone using the difference between the total
debt write-down estimate and the forward-looking estimate.13
13

Our approach is similar to the one used by Schmieder, von Wachter, and Bender (2016) to estimate the effect
of nonemployment durations on wage offers, with one important exception. Nonemployment durations must be
estimated relative to some intermediate time period t > 0, making it possible for differential selection into the sample
to bias their estimates. In contrast, we are primarily interested in the forward-looking and liquidity effects of the
experiment, both of which are measured relative to t = 0. Because we include all individuals, including both those
that never enroll in a repayment program and those who enroll but later drop out, our estimates of these effects are
contaminated by dynamic selection over time. Dynamic selection can, however, bias our estimates of the exposure

28

Formally, we test for forward-looking behavior using an estimate of repayment at P W D , or the
end of the repayment program for the debt write-down group (but not the control group). Again,
this is a valid test of forward-looking behavior because the debt write-down and control groups
have identical minimum payments for t ≤ P W D , and therefore have identical exposure to nonstrategic liquidity risk during this time period. As a result, the debt write-down estimate at P W D
is driven by forward-looking behavior alone. The estimate at P W D is likely a lower bound of the
forward-looking effect, however, as the control group may make forward-looking default decisions
for P W D < t ≤ P C , i.e. the end of the repayment program for the control group. As a result, our
estimate of the mechanical exposure effect based on the difference between the total debt writedown effect at P C and the forward-looking effect at P W D is likely an upper bound of the true
exposure effect.
Now consider the minimum payment reductions, which can impact repayment through a liquidity effect and a similar (but oppositely signed) mechanical exposure effect. Following a similar logic,
the model implies that we can test for liquidity effects using payment reduction treatment effects
at P C , or the end of the repayment program for the control group (but not the payment reduction
group). For t ≤ P C , both the control and treatment groups are enrolled in the repayment program,
but the treatment group has lower minimum payments and, as a result, increased liquidity. The
payment reduction estimate at P C is therefore driven by the liquidity effect alone. The payment
reduction estimate at P C likely measures an upper bound of the true liquidity effect, however, as
the treatment group can still make forward-looking default decisions for P C < t ≤ P M P . Thus, as
with the debt write-downs, our estimate of the mechanical exposure effect based on the difference
between the total payment reduction effect at P M P and the liquidity effect at P C likely reflects a
lower bound of the true exposure effect. The appendix provides additional discussion of both the
debt write-down and payment reduction results.
B. Empirical Implementation
We implement these empirical tests using a five step process. First, we calculate how long the
repayment plan would have been had the individual been assigned to the treatment group and how
long the repayment plan would have been had the individual been assigned to the control group.
The treatment plans are shorter for individuals with relatively larger debt write-downs and longer
for individuals with relatively larger minimum payment reductions. For example, individuals with
the largest write-downs have treatment plans that are up to 20 percent shorter than their control
effect because we are comparing treatment effects at different points in time. For example, it is plausible that the
debt write-downs or minimum payment reductions will induce relatively more distressed borrowers to repay their
debts, leading less distressed borrowers to drop out of the repayment program earlier on. This type of selection might
lead to a different composition of treated and control borrowers later in the repayment program. In this scenario,
our estimate of the exposure effect will be biased downwards. To shed some light on this issue, Appendix Table
18 compares the characteristics of control and treatment borrowers completing the repayment program. Only one
of the 28 baseline differences is statistically significant at the ten percent level and the p-value from an F-test of
the joint significance of all of the variables listed is 0.976, suggesting that the experiment did not significantly alter
the composition of borrowers completing the repayment program. Given these results, it appears unlikely that our
estimates of the exposure effect will be significantly biased by dynamic selection.

29

plans, while individuals with the smallest write-downs and largest minimum payment reductions
have treatment plans that are up to 100 percent longer than their control plans. Second, we create
an indicator for staying enrolled in the repayment program until the minimum of the treatment
plan length and the control plan length. This indicator variable measures payment at P W D for
individuals with the shorter treatment plans (i.e. relatively larger write-downs) and payment at P C
for individuals with the longer treatment plans (i.e. relatively larger minimum payment reductions).
Third, we estimate Equation (4) using this new indicator variable. These reduced form estimates
measure the effect of write-downs at P W D and the effect of lower minimum payments at P C . Fourth,
we take the difference between the reduced form treatment effects for full repayment estimated in
Table 3 and the new reduced form treatment effects estimated at the shorter of P W D and P C .
Finally, we calculate the standard error of the difference by bootstrapping the entire procedure
described above 500 times. We define the standard error of the treatment effect difference as the
standard deviation of the resulting distribution of estimated differences.
C. Results
Table 8 presents estimates of the forward-looking, liquidity, and exposure effects for both the debt
write-downs and minimum payment reductions. Column 1 replicates our estimates from column 4
of Table 3, showing the net effect of all channels on completing the repayment program. Columns
2-3 report estimates for still being in the repayment program at the minimum of the treatment
program length and control program length. Column 4 reports the difference between column 1
and columns 2-3.
Debt Write-Down Results: We find that the effect of the debt write-downs on repayment is almost
entirely explained by forward-looking decisions made early in the repayment program, not the
mechanical reduction in default risk from a shorter repayment program. The estimates from Table
8 suggest that at least 85.1 percent of the debt write-down effect is due to the decrease in forwardlooking defaults at the beginning of the repayment program. Decreased exposure to risk at the end
of repayment can explain a maximum of 14.9 percent of the write-down effect, with the 95 percent
confidence interval including estimates of up to 38.2 percent of the total reduced form effect.
Additional evidence in favor of forward-looking effects comes from Figure 1, which plots treatment effects at every point in the distribution. Two patterns emerge from these results. First, there
is an immediate impact of the debt write-downs on repayment, indicating forward-looking behavior at program sign up. Second, the effects of the debt write-downs, if anything, grow over time
relative to the control mean. These results suggest additional forward-looking behavior throughout the repayment program, not just at program sign up. Taken at face value, these two findings
rule out many of the most simple “behavioral” explanations for our debt write-down results, such
as borrowers being “tricked” into signing up for the repayment program by some feature of the
experimental design.
Minimum Payment Results: We find that while liquidity constraints are a somewhat important
30

driver of default in our sample, the positive short-run effect of increasing liquidity is offset by the
unintended, negative effect of the longer repayment period. The minimum payment reductions
have a small positive impact of about 0.03 percentage points on repayment through the liquidity
effect, with the 95 percent confidence interval including effects as large as 0.16 percentage points.
In all specifications, however, any positive liquidity effect is nearly exactly offset by the negative
exposure effect. These estimates are also consistent with the patterns observed in Figure 1, where
we see a small positive effect of the minimum payment reductions in the short run, and a small
negative effect of the payment reductions in the long run.
These results help to reconcile our findings the vast literature documenting liquidity constraints
in a variety of settings, while indicating that the potential benefits of targeting these liquidity
constraints may have been significantly overstated, at least in our setting. Of course, the standard
caveat applies that the effects of an increase in liquidity may be non-linear or context dependent.
For example, it is possible the short-run benefits from a very large increase in liquidity may outweigh
the long-run costs of a much longer repayment period. It is also possible that liquidity may be more
important in the mortgage or student loan markets, where borrowers usually have fewer outside
options compared to the credit card borrowers that we study in this paper.

VI. Conclusion
This paper uses information from a large-scale randomized experiment to estimate the effects of
immediate minimum payment reductions targeting short-run liquidity constraints and delayed debt
write-downs targeting longer-run debt overhang. We find that the debt write-downs significantly
improved both financial and labor market outcomes, particularly for the highest-debt borrowers,
despite not taking effect for three to five years. In contrast, we find no positive effects of the
more immediate payment reductions on any outcome. These results stand in stark contrast to the
widespread view that short-run liquidity constraints are the most important driver of borrower
distress.
Our results are of particular importance in light of the ongoing debate on the relative merits
of different types of debt relief. For example, current banking regulations in the United States
prevent credit card issuers from offering more generous debt write-downs, at least in part due
to the perceived unimportance of longer-run constraints such as debt overhang.14,15 During the
financial crisis, a group of credit card issuers asked for these regulations to be relaxed so that
14

Specifically, U.S. banking regulations prevent credit card issuers from simultaneously reducing the original principal and lengthening the repayment period unless a debt is first classified as impaired. If the original principal is
reduced without the debt being classified as impaired, borrowers are required to pay off the remaining debt in just a
few months. Government regulators justify these restrictions based on concerns about when delinquent debts would
be recognized on the card issuers’ balance sheets.
15
There was an analogous debate regarding targeted debt relief for mortgage borrowers during the financial crisis.
For example, former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner wrote in his memoir that the
government’s “biggest debate [during the financial crisis] was whether to try to reduce overall mortgage loans or just monthly payments.”

they could conduct a pilot program forgiving up to 40 percent of a credit card borrower’s original
principal (while restructuring the remaining principal to be repaid over a number of years and
deferring any income taxes owed on the forgiven principal). Our results suggest that there may be
substantial benefits of considering such pilot programs.
An important limitation of our analysis is that we are not able to estimate the impact of targeted
debt relief on ex-ante borrower behavior or ex-ante borrowing costs. There may also be important
ex-post impacts of targeted debt relief on outcomes such as post-repayment interest rates that we
are unable to measure with our data. Finally, we are unable to test whether the forward-looking
decisions documented in this paper are due to rational or non-rational decision making. These
questions remain important areas for future research.

Notes: This table describes the effect of treatment eligibility on repayment program attributes and lender costs.
Minimum payment is the minimum required payment of the program. Financing fees include the total cost of all
interest rate payments and late fees. Total months is the total number of months before the program is complete. All
program characteristics and lender costs are calculated using the control means for debt ($18,212), minimum payment
(2.38% of debt), and interest rate (8.5%). The net present value (NPV) of lender costs (relative to the baseline case)
using the control mean for the monthly default rate during the repayment program (1.12%) and using discount rates
of 0%, 8.5%, and 20%. The first row reports program characteristics for the baseline case in the control group. The
second row reports program characteristics after the 50th percentile debt write-down in the treatment group in terms
of the implied interest rate cut. The third row reports program characteristics after the 50th percentile minimum
payment reduction in the treatment group in terms of the percentage point decrease in the required payment.

Notes: This table reports descriptive statistics and balance tests for the estimation sample. Information on age,
gender, race, earnings, employment, and 401k contributions is only available for individuals matched to the SSA data
and information on collections debt and credit score are only available for individuals matched to the TU data. Each
baseline outcome is for the year before the experiment. Potential minimum payment and interest rates are calculated
using the amount of debt held by each creditor and the rules listed in Appendix Table 1. All dollar amounts are
divided by 1,000. Column 3 reports the difference between the treatment and control groups, controlling for strata
fixed effects and clustering standard errors at the counselor level. *** = significant at 1 percent level, ** = significant
at 5 percent level, * = significant at 10 percent level. The p-value is from an F-test of the joint significance of the
variables listed.

Notes: This table reports the forward-looking, liquidity, and exposure effects of each treatment. Column 1 reports
results for fully completing debt repayment. Columns 2-3 reports results for being enrolled in the repayment program
at the minimum of the treatment program length or the control program length. All specifications control for potential
debt write-down, potential minimum payment reduction, the baseline controls in Table 2, and strata fixed effects.
Standard errors for column 4 are calculated using the bootstrap procedure described in the text. *** = significant
at 1 percent level, ** = significant at 5 percent level, * = significant at 10 percent level. See the text for additional
details on the estimation procedure.

Panel A: ITT Estimates
Treatment Eligibility

Notes: This table reports reduced form estimates with no baseline controls. Panel A reports the coefficient on
treatment eligibility. Panel B reports coefficients on the interaction of treatment eligibility and potential debt writedown (in terms of the interest rate in percentage points), and the interaction of treatment eligibility and potential
minimum payment reduction (in percentage points x 100). All specifications control for potential debt write-down,
potential monthly minimum reduction, and strata fixed effects, and cluster standard errors at the counselor level.
*** = significant at 1 percent level, ** = significant at 5 percent level, * = significant at 10 percent level. See Table

and cluster standard errors at the counselor level. Column 4 reports the p-value from an F-test that all interactions
are jointly equal to zero. See Table 2 notes for additional details on the sample and variable construction.

Notes: This table describes correlates of potential treatment intensity. The dependent variable for column 2 is the
potential change in interest rates. The dependent variable for column 3 is the potential change in minimum payments
(x 100). All regressions control for strata fixed effects and cluster standard errors at the counselor level. *** =
significant at 1 percent level, ** = significant at 5 percent level, * = significant at 10 percent level.

Notes: This table reports over-identification tests. Panel A reports the baseline results from Tables 3-6. Panel B adds treatment x
credit card issuer fixed effects. Panel C adds treatment x demographic fixed effects for gender, race, homeownership, credit score,
employment, and 401k contributions. Panel D adds both treatment x credit card issuer and treatment x demographic fixed effects.
We also report the p-value from an F-test that all of the indicated interactions are jointly equal to zero. All specifications control
for treatment eligibility interacted with the potential debt write-down, treatment eligibility interacted with the potential minimum
payment reduction, potential debt write-down, potential minimum payment reduction, the baseline controls listed in Table 2, and
strata fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the counselor level. *** = significant at 1 percent level, ** = significant at 5
percent level, * = significant at 10 percent level. See Table 2 notes for details on the baseline controls and sample.

Notes: This table reports reduced form estimates for additional outcomes. Panel A reports the coefficient on treatment
eligibility. Panel B reports coefficients on the interaction of treatment eligibility and potential debt write-down (in
terms of the interest rate in percentage points), and the interaction of treatment eligibility and potential minimum
payment reduction (in percentage points x 100). All specifications control for potential debt write-down, potential
monthly minimum reduction, and strata fixed effects, and cluster standard errors at the counselor level. *** =
significant at 1 percent level, ** = significant at 5 percent level, * = significant at 10 percent level. See Table 2 notes

Notes: This table reports reduced form estimates of the impact of debt relief on bankruptcy. Information on
bankruptcy comes from court records. We report coefficients on the interaction of treatment eligibility and potential
debt write-down (in terms of the interest rate in percentage points), and the interaction of treatment eligibility and
potential minimum payment reduction (in percentage points x 100). All specifications control for potential debt
write-down, potential minimum payment reduction, the baseline controls in Table 2, and strata fixed effects, and
cluster standard errors at the counselor level. *** = significant at 1 percent level, ** = significant at 5 percent level,
* = significant at 10 percent level. See Table 2 notes for details on the baseline controls and sample.

A. Additional Details from the Model Setup
Let qt ∈ {0, 1} be a binary variable where qt = 1 denotes default in period t, and qt = 0 repayment
in t. The net cash flow v (t, q) associated with the default decision q in period t is:
v (t, 1) = x
v (t, 0) = yt − dt
Then, the continuation value V (t, q) of making decision q subject to the liquidity constraint v for
any time period 0 ≤ t < P is given by the present discounted value of the contemporaneous period
cash flow of decision q and the future value of expected future cash flows associated with q:

The model is characterized by the value of repayment in period t = P given by Equation (9)

Equation (10) shows that while contemporaneous net income v r (y) = y − d is unaffected by t for
t < P , the option value of continuing repayment Qr (t) is weakly increasing in t for 0 ≤ t < P . This
is because the absence of payments or liquidity risk for solvent individuals in periods t > P means
the option value of repayment increases as individuals approach the end of the repayment period.
As a result, the total value of repayment V r (t, y) is also weakly increasing in t for 0 ≤ t < P .
B. Solving for Individuals’ Default Decision
The model implies that default decisions are driven by two separate forces: (1) involuntary default
that occurs among individuals who are liquidity constrained, and (2) the strategic response to a
low income draw among individuals who are not liquidity constrained.
To see this, first recall that the liquidity constraint implies automatic default for individuals
with y ≤ v + d. Next, note that default occurs for individuals with y > v + d if and only if
V r (t, y) < V d , where the value of repayment V r (t, y) is strictly increasing in y. This implies that
optimal default behavior for a liquid individual can be characterized by a path of cutoff values φ∗t ,
defined by:
V r (t, φ∗t ) = V d

67

where an individual defaults if yt < φ∗t . Taken together, these two facts imply that general default
behavior can be characterized by φt :

1 if y ≤ φ
t
q (t, y) =
0 if y > φ
t

(11)

φt = max (φ∗t , v + d)

(12)

To solve for the path of φ∗ in periods 0 ≤ t ≤ P , we use the decision rule given by Equation
(11) to write the individuals’ Bellman equation (10) as:
V r (t, y) = y − d + β

Next, we use the fact that individuals are indifferent between repayment and default when the
income draw is equal to the cutoff (i.e. V r (t, φ∗t ) = V d ) to show that:
V r (t, φ∗t ) =

the path of default cutoffs φ∗t for liquid individuals in periods 0 ≤ t ≤ P :

Following the discussion in the main text, Equation (16) implies that the optimal default cutoffs

Default cutoffs φt for 0 ≤ t < P can be found via backward recursion using the difference equation
given by Equation (17) and the explicit solution for φP given by Equation (18).
C. Default Likelihood and Repayment
To examine the impact of the experiment on repayment rates through two different channels,
we must show how the default behavior described by Equation (17) affects the probability of
individuals’ remaining in repayment through period t. To do this, we first define an expression for
risk of default among repaying individuals at period t:

F (φ ) if t ≤ P
t
λ (t) ≡
0
if t > P
where we note that the hazard rate λ (t) is weakly decreasing as individuals approach the end of
repayment. This result is due to the path of optimal default cutoffs φt strictly decreasing for all
0 ≤ t < P . Also note that the hazard rate λ (t) is strictly decreasing as individuals approach the
end of repayment if F (·) is assumed to increase strictly for all 0 ≤ t < P .
We then decompose the hazard rate λ (t) into strategic and non-strategic default risks:
λ (t) ≡ ρ (t) + γ (t)

69

(19)

where

F (v + d) if

 φt dF (y)
v +d
ρ (t) ≡
0

t≤P

(20)

t>P
if t ≤ P

(21)

if t > P

To map the hazard rates from each channel into the repayment rates observed in the experiment,
we first define the probability of remaining in repayment by period θ (t) as:
θ (t) ≡

t
Y

[1 − λ (k)]

(22)

k=0

using the fact that λ (t) is the conditional likelihood of exiting repayment at t. Letting the probability of avoiding default throughout the repayment period be Θ ≡ θP , we then have that the
probability of avoiding default through the entire repayment period Θ is:
Θ=

P
Y

[1 − λ (t)]

(23)

t=0

Using this framework, we can now investigate the implications of the experiment on the default
likelihood λ (t; ξ) as a function of the period t and repayment plan parameter ξ (e.g., repayment
period P , minimum payment d, etc.). To see this, note that Equation (19) implies:
λ (t; ξ) =

ρ (t; ξ)

γ (t; ξ)

which gives us the model’s predicted repayment probability Θ:

[1 − ρ (t; ξ) − γ (t; ξ)]

(24)

where we have the familiar result that repayment rates are driven by two factors: (1) involuntary
default that occurs among individuals who are liquidity constrained, and (2) the strategic response
to a low income draw among individuals who are not liquidity constrained.

D. Proofs of Model Predictions
D.1

Proof of Debt Write-Down Prediction

In this section, we expand on the discussion of the debt write-down effect from the main text before
providing a formal proof of the debt write-down prediction.
Preliminaries: The write-down treatment shortens the repayment period P to P W D < P C while
keeping the monthly payments d the same dW D = dC . Our model predicts that the write-down
treatment increases debt repayment through two complementary effects: (1) a decrease in treated
individuals’ incentive to strategically default while both treatment and control individuals are
enrolled in the repayment program, and (2) a decrease in treated individuals’ exposure to default
risk while control individuals are still enrolled in the repayment program and treatment individuals
are not.
To formally establish these predictions, we first consider how the treatment reduces the “strategic risk” of default in periods 0 ≤ t ≤ P W D :
∆ρ ≈

∂ρ (t; P )
∆P < 0
∂P

(25)

The direction of the strategic channel is weakly positive because a shorter repayment period increases individuals’ strategic incentive to stay in repayment, thereby reducing strategic default
probability among treated individuals. This is because the lifetime of debt has been shortened
P C − P W D periods, leading treated individuals to place more value on repayment in each time
period t. Formally, it can be shown that:
∂φ∗ (t; P )
∂P
∂ρ (t; P )
∂P

∂E [V r (t, y)]
∂t
∂ρ (t)
= −
∂t
=

Implying that the shorter repayment period decreases optimal default cutoffs at exactly the rate
that expected continuation value increases over time. Intuitively, shortening repayment lengths
brings individuals closer to the point of solvency t = P , making it possible for these individuals
to accept lower net income in t in anticipation greater income in future time periods. As a result,
there is an increase in the mean continuation value E [V r (t, y)] for all 0 ≤ t < P W D , resulting in a
lower strategic cutoff φ∗t .
Note that effects through the strategic risk channel in periods 0 ≤ t ≤ P W D are tempered by the
presence of liquidity constraints, as changes in strategic default behavior are only realized for liquid
individuals (i.e. yt > v + d). In other words, the change in default cutoffs ∆φ (t) = φW D (t) − φC (t)
can only be so large in magnitude because φW D (t) and φC (t) are bounded below by v + d.
Next, we consider the non-strategic default likelihood in periods 0 ≤ t ≤ P W D :
∆γ ≈

∂γ (t; P )
∆P = 0
∂P
71

(26)

In contrast to this strategic effect in periods 0 ≤ t ≤ P W D , the non-strategic default likelihood in
periods 0 ≤ t ≤ P W D is exactly zero. This is because the liquidity constraint v + d is the same
for both the treatment and control groups in periods t ≤ P W D , meaning that treated individuals
are no more or less liquid. There is therefore zero effect through the non-strategic channel in these
time periods.
Finally, we consider both the strategic and non-strategic default probabilities in periods P W D <
t ≤ P C . By assumption, “repayment” in these periods is automatic for treated individuals that
have not defaulted by P W D . In contrast, control individuals are still exposed to both strategic and
non-strategic default risk. Differences in default rates are therefore given by:
∆λ (t) = 0 − λC (t)
= −ρC (t) − γ C (t)
where we have the result that default risk has decreased mechanically through both strategic and
non-strategic channels. Again, this is because control individuals still face the possibility of both
voluntary or involuntary default, while both forms of default risk have been eliminated for treated
individuals.
Proof of Debt Write-Down Prediction: Given the above insights concerning default likelihood
throughout the experiment, we can now predict the effect of lower debt write-downs on the change

in repayment rates ∆θ. First, consider θ P W D , the treatment effect at t = P W D , which is given

control individuals, the treatment effect at ∆θ P W D is driven entirely by differences in strategic
default behavior φ∗ (t).

Following the proof of the debt write-down prediction, we first expand on the discussion of the
minimum payment effect from the main text before providing a formal proof of the minimum
payment prediction.
Preliminaries: The minimum payment treatment reduces the required minimum payment by
lengthening the repayment period. In the context of our model, a lower minimum payment can
therefore be thought of as lengthening the repayment period P to P M P > P C while keeping the
PP M P
P C
total debt burden the same Pt=0 dt =
t=0 dt . Our model predicts an ambiguous impact of
the minimum payment treatment on repayment rates due to three opposing effects: (1) a decrease
in treated individuals’ non-strategic or liquidity-based default while both treatment and control
individuals are enrolled in the repayment program, (2) an ambiguous change in treated individuals’ incentive to strategically default while both treatment and control individuals are enrolled in
the repayment program, and (3) an increase in treated individuals’ exposure to default risk while
treated individuals are still enrolled in the repayment program and control individuals are not.
To formally establish these predictions, we first alter the model to make monthly payment d
endogenous. Specifically, we let D denote the individuals debt balance at t = 0 and treat repayment
amounts d as function of their total debt D and repayment period length P :
d = d (P, D) =

D
P

V r (t) = y − d (P, D) + βE max V r t + 1, y , V d y
To consider the effects of an increase in P , we must investigate how strategic and non-strategic
73

risk respond to both a greater repayment length and lower minimum payments. We first restrict
our attention to periods in which neither group has reached solvency (0 ≤ t ≤ P C ). Consider
treatment’s effect on strategic default risk ρ (t), holding liquidity constraints fixed. We have:
∆ρ ≈

(27)

The direction of the strategic channel is ambiguous because two opposing forces influence individuals’ considerations of whether or not default is optimal. First, extending the number of periods in
which individuals make payments will, all else equal, increase strategic risk ( ∂ρ(P,d)
∂P ∆P > 0). This
is the same as the effect from the debt write-down treatment (25), only in the opposite direction.
Thus, as the end of repayment P moves farther away, the option value of repayment is lower because
treated individuals anticipate a more difficult road to solvency. On the other hand, the decrease
∂d
in minimum payment size will decrease default risk ( ∂ρ(P,d)
∂d ∂P ∆P < 0), as lower payments mean

higher cash flows both presently and in expectation. The net direction of changes in strategic risk
depends on the relative magnitude of “solvency” and “payment” effects, which vary according to
the period. In t = 0, the payment effect must dominate and strategic concerns must have a net
negative effect on default likelihood. This is due to the fact that the minimum payment treatment
only lowers the minimum payments individuals have to pay, repayment under the terms of control
individuals (i.e. higher minimum payments and shorter repayment length) is still in each treated
individual’s choice set. Therefore, repayment in period t = 0 must be at least as attractive as
it would have been under control conditions. However, as each period passes, control individuals
have paid an increasingly larger portion of their debt burden D relative to treated individuals. As
t approaches the end of control repayment period P C , control individuals have already repaid all

but a small portion of their debt PDC , whereas treated individuals have a remaining loan balance
of ∆P ∗

D
P MP

, and thus have less incentive to avoid default.

Now consider treatment’s effect on non-strategic default risk γ (t) in periods 0 ≤ t ≤ P C . We
have:
∆γ ≈

∂γ ∂d
∆P < 0
∂d ∂P

(28)

In contrast to the strategic channel, the non-strategic channel has an unambiguously negative effect
∂d
on default risk. Liquidity constraints are less likely to bind under treatment ( ∂γ
∂d ∂P ∆P < 0) because

payments are lower and net income is higher. So, holding her strategy fixed, a treated individual
is less likely to be forced into involuntary default in periods t ≤ P C because repayment has been
made less onerous in these periods. Note that this only affects total default probability λ (t) if some
“illiquid” control individuals would optimally repay (i.e. φ∗ (t) < v + dC and ρ (t) = 0). Otherwise,
differences in liquidity only occur among individuals who would default anyway.
Finally, we consider periods P C < t ≤ P M P . Just as it was for treated individuals under the
debt write-down treatment, under minimum payment treatment debt has been completely forgiven

74

for control individuals in these periods. Using Equation (24), we have:
∆λ (t) = λM P (t) − 0
= ρM P (t) + γ M P (t)
The difference in default probability between treatment and control for any period P C < t ≤ P M P
is simply the sum of strategic and liquidity risk components contributing to default risk for treated
individuals who are still in repayment.
Proof of Minimum Payment Prediction: We can now use these insights to predict treatment effects

risk for treated individuals (γ M P (t) − γ C (t) < 0), but the difference in strategic default risk
ρM P (t)−ρC (t) is ambiguous in both size and magnitude due to the countervailing forces associated
with making a lower payment for a longer time period. The lower minimum payment treatment
therefore has an ambiguous impact on repayment rates at P C .
