ABSTRACT
We examine the distribution of Federal support for chemistry Research and Development (R&D)
performed at U.S. universities from 1990-2009. Federal R&D funding is an essential source of
funds for investigator-driven research at the nation’s universities. Previous studies have
documented that aggregated federal R&D funding has become more dispersed over time and
attributed this to political pressure to spread resources more evenly. There have, however, been
few studies of the allocation of funds within narrowly defined scientific disciplines. By
narrowing the focus and exploiting the panel nature of our data we are better able to analyze the
correlates of funding variation, yielding a number of new insights not apparent in studies using
more aggregated data. First, we find that R&D expenditures at the discipline level are
considerably more volatile than aggregate funding. Second, we show a strong positive
association between several measures of institutional research capacity and future funding. In
particular, we find a positive association between the employment of postdoctoral researchers and
higher future research funding.

1. Introduction
Despite the central role of federal Research& Development (R&D) funding in supporting
basic scientific research conducted at the nation’s universities, relatively little attention has
been given to how these federal funds are allocated. Attracting research funding is important
for university leaders not only because it signals the reputation and prestige of their faculty, but
because this support typically includes payments for research overhead costs that cannot be
allocated to specific research projects. These payments for “Facilities and Administration”
(F&A) costs are commonly in the range of 50% or more of the direct costs of the research being
performed. For public institutions grappling with shrinking state appropriations and private
institutions seeking to control the growth of tuition, this stream of funding has become
increasingly important for stabilizing budgets. Collectively the nation’s universities advocate for
expansion of the federal research budget, while individually they are all seeking to capture a
larger slice of the pie and move up in the rankings. This paper studies the allocation of federal
research funding in chemistry to research universities, and finds that research capacity is a key
determinant of funding.
While it is true that the ultimate goal of federal support for basic research is to advance
the frontiers of knowledge, the allocation of federal R&D funds also has a number of other
important implications for higher education institutions. Grant funds provide much of the
support for the training of doctoral and post-doctoral scholars, so the way in which funds are
allocated plays an important role in determining where the next generation of scholars will be
educated. At the same time, the linkage between F&A payments and the direct costs of science
means that the allocation of funds has implications for the support of scientific infrastructure.

2
Together these factors influence institutional reputations and resources that affect faculty
recruiting, and shape the structure of the higher education enterprise.1
Most discussions of the allocation of Federal R&D funding have been purely descriptive
and concerned with aggregate funding across all disciplines. There has been little attention to
the factors that influence the distribution of funding to individual universities. The premise of
the merit-review process used by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes
of Health (NIH) and other federal agencies is that funding should be allocated to support the
best science as judged by other scientists. Yet the primacy of merit review has not fully
insulated science funding from the pressure of members of Congress seeking to steer more
federal science funds to their own districts. These pressures are manifested both in earmarks
for certain projects and in programs like NSF’s Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive
Research (EPSCoR) and NIH’s Institutional Development Award (IDeA) Program, both of which
target funding to scientists in states receiving disproportionately low levels of funding.
Universities are, of course, concerned about their rankings in the National Science
Foundation’s annual survey of Higher Education R&D Expenditures, citing high levels of funding
as a marker of prestige. There is a small literature that has used these aggregate data to
explore what might be called the political economy of federal science funding. Geiger and
Feller (1995), Graham and Diamond (1997) and Feller (2001) have used aggregate Federal R&D
funding to states or universities to document the growth of national research capacity and the
expansion of the group of research universities beyond the small group of elite universities that
1

Research universities are themselves sources of local economic development spillovers. As
attention to the innovation systems that have emerged in Silicon Valley, Route 128 around
Boston, the Research Triangle and in Austin, Texas suggests, fostering robust university
research enterprises is seen as one key to innovation-led economic growth strategies.

3
dominated research and graduate training in the 1950s. In the 1950s and 1960s, as a result of
federal investments in science after Sputnik, the group of research universities expanded
significantly (Graham and Diamond 1997, ch. 2). Since the mid-1970s, however, as the growth
of federal R&D funding slowed, the group of research universities has more or less stabilized,
and competition between them to move up the rankings has intensified. This literature is,
however, more descriptive than analytical, and offers few empirical insights about the factors
that influence the distribution of funding across universities or variations in a university’s
funding over time.
In addition to this work there have also been some studies that explored the
interactions between federal and non-federal sources of funding. Mostly this research has
been motivated by the question of whether federal funding is a substitute or complement for
non-federal funding. Using somewhat different approaches Blume-Kohout, Kumar, and Sood
(2014), Payne (2001), and Lanahan, et al. (2016) have all concluded that increased federal
funding tends to increase research expenditures from other sources rather than crowding them
out.2 Ehrenberg, Rizzo, and Jakubson (2003) have pointed out that in aggregate, since the
1980s the share of university research expenses supported by federal funds has declined,
dropping from over 60% to under 55%. Analyzing panel data for 228 universities, they conclude
that universities have responded to the falling levels of federal support by reducing facultystudent ratios, and increasing tuition, in effect subsidizing research expenditures by increasing
the costs and reducing the quality of instruction.

David, Hall, and Toole (2000) survey the literature on the relationship between federal and
industrial R&D spending.

4
Aggregate descriptions of the sort noted above are helpful in sketching the broad
outlines of federal research support, but because they combine data on funding across a broad
range of scientific disciplines they cannot yield much insight about the factors influencing the
patterns that they describe. Wachtel (2000) has analyzed the distribution of the National
Science Foundation’s funding of economics research. Given that economics funding has been
concentrated among a few institutions, he argued that funding decisions are not being made
objectively. In contrast, Feinberg and Price (2004) controlled for proposal quality and found
that researchers affiliated with the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) were more
likely to receive funding than otherwise comparable applicants.
Focusing at the level of individual investigators, Ginther et al. (2011, 2012, 2016)
examined race/ethnicity and gender differences in the probability of receiving NIH funding.
After controlling for several individual and institutional covariates, these studies found that the
NIH funding rank of the institution was associated with a higher probability of funding. In other
words, the wealthier the institution in terms of NIH funding, the more likely a proposal from an
investigator affiliated with that institution was to receive funding. However, these studies do
not control for the fact that the best researchers are more likely to be employed by the bestfunded institutions.
With the exception of these few studies, we are not aware of other work that has
sought to analyze the distribution of federal R&D funding within a single scientific discipline. If
we are going to gain greater insight about the factors that influence the allocation of funding,
however, it is necessary to study funding at this more disaggregated disciplinary level. In this
article we provide what we believe is one of the first empirical examinations of the

5
determinants of the distribution of research funding, examining the factors that influence
federally funded R&D expenditures in chemistry at a panel of 147 U.S. universities between
1990 and 2009.
Because of disciplinary differences in publication and citation practices, as well as
variation in laboratory structure and organization we believe it is essential that any effort to
identify the determinants of funding must be conducted at a disaggregated level, rather than
attempting to encompass aggregate R&D Funding. Chemistry provides an excellent area for our
exploration. It is a foundational discipline that receives a relatively large level of federal R&D
funding, amounting to over $1 billion annually, or close to 4% of federally funded universityperformed R&D in the period we are considering. In addition, chemistry research includes a
broad range of topics, from fundamental scientific exploration to highly applied areas in
biochemistry and chemical engineering. Also, the organization of the Chemistry discipline
allowed us to compile the necessary data to analyze inputs in the knowledge production
process. The American Chemical Society keeps a roster of members that allows us to identify
Chemistry and Chemical engineering faculty at research universities over several decades.
These data are not readily available in other disciplines.
Our empirical results offer a number of intriguing and policy-relevant insights about the
allocation of funding in this field. First, we document that scientific capacity plays a large role in
the distribution of funding. Faculty numbers, graduate program size, and numbers of
postdoctoral scholars are all positively associated with Federal R&D funding. Of these
relationships, however, only the number of postdoctoral scholars is consistently statistically
significant. The effect of an additional postdoc is also economically large, implying an increase

6
in funding of nearly $14,000 in Federal R&D funding. Second, consistent with the focus of most
federal agencies on scientific merit, we find holding personnel numbers constant, higher rates
of publication are associated with more funding. Third, we find that higher levels of non-federal
R&D funding are associated with more federal funding, a result with the complementarity
between these funding sources found by Blume-Kohout, Kumar, and Sood (2014) and Payne
(2001).
We begin in the next section by describing in more detail the data that we use, and
present a number of summary and descriptive statistics. We show that federal support for
chemistry research is quite unevenly distributed across universities and that the overall size
distribution of funding has remained stable over time. Looking at the performance of individual
institutions, however, belies the initial impression of stability. The fortunes of particular
universities have changed quite a bit since the early 1990s. In section 3, we introduce a
dynamic panel regression framework to systematically analyze the determinants of funding at
the university level. This analysis points to several important conclusions. Section 4 places
these results in context and considers their significance for our understanding of federal
support for university-based R&D.

2. An Overview of the Research Funding Landscape for Academic Chemistry

Our analysis sample consists of the 147 institutions with the highest aggregate value of
real federally financed academic chemistry R&D expenditures over the 20-year period from
1990 to 2009. We initially focused on the top 150 institutions, but were subsequently obliged

7
to drop three of them because the available data were incomplete or appeared inconsistent.3 In
aggregate, our sample accounted for over 90% of federally supported and total chemistry R&D
expenditures in each year, produced more than 90% of research doctorates earned in
chemistry annually, and employed almost 95% of the postdoctoral researchers. The institutions
in our sample also represent a highly diverse population ranging from chemistry powerhouses
such as MIT, which averaged close to $37 million (in constant 2005 prices) in total chemistry
R&D expenditures annually, to Cleveland State University, which averaged under $1.2 million in
chemistry R&D expenditures in the same period.

Insert Figure 1 about here

Table 1 lists the 147 institutions in out sample, ranked from highest to lowest in total
real federally financed chemistry R&D expenditures over the entire twenty-year period 19902009. The table also reports average federally financed R&D expenditures for 5 year periods. It
is apparent that funds are distributed relatively unequally, with the top 10 institutions receiving
approximately 20% of funds in each period, and the top 20 accounting for more than one-third
of total funding. In Figure 1 we have plotted Lorenz curves illustrating the distribution of
Federal R&D Expenditures in 5 year periods from 1990 through 2009. Were funds equally
distributed the plot would lie along the 45-degree line, which is also graphed for reference.

3

The three institutions dropped from our sample included two academic medical centers: the
University of California San Francisco and the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center—which reported no chemistry faculty, graduate students or postdocs for much of the
study period—and the Oregon Institute of Science and Technology, which disappears from the
HERD data after 2001.

8
Reflecting the concentration of funding at a relatively small number of institutions each of the
plots lies well below the 45 degree line. Although the magnitude of the changes does not
appear to be too great, there has been a small tendency toward an increase in the levels of
R&D expenditures at institutions in the middle of the distribution over the period we are
considering.

Insert Table 1 about here

The stability of the overall distribution of funding conceals, however, a much more
dynamic pattern of funding at individual institutions. The last two columns of Table 1 report
the highest and lowest ordinal rankings of each institution in annual R&D expenditures over the
period 1990-2009. Over the 20 years covered by our data, many institutions moved up or down
by as much as 10 or 20 places in the rankings. The extent of this temporal variation is illustrated
in Figure 2, which plots 5-year average expenditures (measured in constant 2005 dollars) at
each institution against its rank in the 1990-1994 period. The solid circles, plotting the 19901994 average values follow a steadily declining gradient, but there is considerable dispersion in
values around this line as time progresses. Rising levels of federal funding for chemistry R&D
mean that the overall tendency is for expenditures to move up, but there are a substantial
number of institutions that experienced declines in federal R&D funding, and even among those
that experienced increases in funding the magnitude of increases varied considerably over
time.

9
Insert Figure 2 About here

These data raise several important questions. First, what factors account for the
pronounced inequality of federal funding across universities at each point in time? Second,
why does funding at individual universities vary so substantially over time? In the next section
we implement an estimation strategy that allows us to offer at least a partial answer to these
questions.

3. Modeling the Distribution of Federal Funding

3.1 Estimation
There are at least 14 different federal agencies that support some extramural R&D.
However, the primary federal sources of funding for university research are the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF).4 At both of these
agencies funding is distributed through a number of different mechanisms, but the dominant
paradigm is to fund investigator-driven projects that are evaluated largely on their scientific
merit. Both agencies rely heavily on the judgment of university scientists to assess the
strengths of the proposals they receive. At the National Science Foundation, proposed research
projects are evaluated based on the criteria of intellectual merit and broader impacts of the
proposed activity. Although the terminology NIH uses to articulate its criteria—significance,
approach, innovation, investigator qualifications, and environment—is somewhat different
4

See Gans and Murray (2012) for a detailed discussion of the range and objectives of federal
extramural R&D funding.

10
from that used by NSF, the two agencies are, as Gans and Murray observe (2012, p. 61)
“…strikingly similar…” in the qualities that they seek to emphasize.
While both NSF and NIH selection processes are fundamentally forward-looking, in the
sense that they emphasize the potential significance of the activities that are proposed, they
also give weight to the qualifications of the investigators to successfully carry out the proposed
research and to institutional characteristics, such as the presence of specialized facilities that
may be necessary to conduct the research. To investigate how these factors affect the
allocation of funding we postulate a model of the determinants of federally financed R&D
expenditures, which we denote as r, at institution i in year t as:
(1)

rit = f(Xit-1,i, t; it)

where X is a vector of time and institution varying characteristics,  captures any fixed
institution-specific effects on funding,  is a year effect that captures common temporal shocks
to funding, and  is a stochastic error term. The variables in X are lagged one year, to reflect
the fact that expenditures in t are determined by the success of past funding applications, so it
is characteristics in the previous period that will affect available funding.
Because most federal grants are awarded for periods of anywhere from 3 to 5 years
these is likely to be considerable serial correlation in institutional expenditures between
successive years. Taking account of the these lags, and assuming a linear approximation to
equation (1) our estimating equation becomes:
(2)

𝑟𝑖𝑡 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛽𝑡 + 𝛾1 𝑟𝑖𝑡−1 + 𝛾2 𝑟𝑖𝑡−2 + ∑ 𝛿 𝑋𝑖𝑡−1 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡

To the extent that institutional reputations affect the allocation of funding this effect will be
captured by the panel variable, 𝛼𝑖 , which will absorb all fixed university-specific influences on

11
funding. Similarly, the inclusion of a full set of time dummies will absorb any common, timedependent influences on research funding, such as increases in overall federal R&D funding.
Because of the autoregressive nature of research funding as expressed in equation (2),
conventional approaches to fixed effects panel estimation are inappropriate (Cameron and
Trivedi 2010, p. 293-94). Instead it is necessary to deal with fixed effects by taking the first
difference of equation (2). The time invariant effects, represented by 𝛼𝑖 , are cancelled out,
resulting in the transformed equation:
(3)

∆𝑟𝑖𝑡 = Δ𝛽𝑡 + 𝛾1 ∆𝑟𝑖𝑡−1 + 𝛾2 ∆𝑟𝑖𝑡−2 + ∑ 𝛾 ∆𝑋𝑖𝑡−1 + ∆𝜀𝑖𝑡

First differencing removes university fixed effects from the estimating equation, but introduces
a new estimation problem because by construction the lagged dependent variables are no
longer exogenous with respect to the error term ∆𝜀𝑖𝑡 . A number of approaches have been
suggested for estimating the autoregressive relationship using instrumental variables. The
most widely used approach, proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991), uses longer lags of the
dependent variable as instruments. We use the Arellano-Bond method to estimate the factors
associated with university chemistry funding.

3.2 Data
To conduct our analysis, we have gathered annual data on federally funded and total
academic chemistry and chemical engineering (for brevity we will refer to these combined
fields as chemistry) R&D expenditures at U.S. universities and colleges between 1990 and 2009
from NSF’s Higher Education Research and Development (HERD) survey (see Rosenbloom et al.

12
2015). 5 We link these to data on publications and citations to those publications derived from
Thomson Reuters Web of Science database, counts of doctorates awarded and postdoctoral
scholars from the NSF-NIH survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctoral scholars, and faculty
counts that we hand collected from directories published by the American Chemical Society.
Additional details concerning data sources and how we linked them are contained in the Data
Appendix. We chose to focus on academic chemistry because it is well established, widely
represented across the universe of higher education institutions, and accounts for a significant
share (about 4%) of federally funded academic R&D.
In Table 2 we report sample means for federally funded R&D and for each of the
institutional characteristics in our data for the full sample, and for various subsets of
institutions. As we might expect institutions in the Carnegie Research I category have higher
levels of chemistry R&D expenditures, employ more faculty and postdoctoral researchers, and
produce more publications and doctoral degrees than do the non-Research I institutions. It is
also notable that the average number of citations to articles published by the Research I
institutions is higher than for the non-Research I universities. To the extent that the number of
citations an article receives is a reflection of its quality or impact, the data in Table 2 also
indicate that private universities produce higher quality publications than do public universities.
5

Although ideally one might want to analyze chemistry and chemical engineering separately,
differences in the way disciplines are defined across our different data sources make it
necessary to aggregate the two distinct fields. To illustrate this point, of the 150 institutions we
initially examined, there were 102 that had chemical engineering departments that reported
faculty numbers in the American Chemical Society directory and 48 that did not. However, only
22 institutions reported zero amounts of federally funded R&D expenditures for chemical
engineering research in every year, and there are no institutions for which Web of Science
recorded zero chemical engineering publications in all years. The mismatch in classification
across the different sources used in our analysis suggests that attempting to analyze these
fields separately would likely cause more problems than it solves.

3.3 Results
We use the XTABOND procedure in STATA 14 to estimate equation (3).6 The estimation
procedure uses heteroscedasticity robust standard errors. STATA transforms the results to
show the coefficients for the original specification in levels. The results are reported in Table 3
for a variety of different combinations of the explanatory variables. In columns (1) through (3)
we add measures of faculty size, numbers of postdocs, and graduate program size. Column (4)
adds non-federal R&D funding levels, and Columns (5) and (6) add our measures of research
quality: publications and average citations per publication. Finally in Column (7) we drop the
scientific capacity measures to test the stability of the other coefficients. Given the stability of
the coefficient estimates across different specifications, we prefer specification (6), which
includes the richest set of explanatory variables.

Insert Table 3 about here

Consistent with the expected serial correlation of R&D expenditures we find that in all
cases the first lag of the dependent variable exerts a large and statistically significant effect.

6

For long panels the number of potential instruments available for the lagged dependent
variable can become quite large. With the inclusion of two lags of the dependent variable
among the regressors there would be two available instruments at t=4, three at t=5, and 18 at
t=20. After some experimentation we opted to limit the number of instruments to a maximum
of 5. Results are not sensitive, however, to changes in this maximum.

14
Consistent with the fact that most awards are for two or more years, roughly 50 percent of an
increase in expenditures in one year persists for a second year. However, the coefficient on the
second lag is smaller and negative, implying some regression toward the mean as the effects of
any positive funding shock begin to wear off with the passage of time.
Turning to measures of research capacity we note that all three of the scale variables
included in our model—the numbers of faculty, postdocs, and doctorates awarded—enter
positively. Because the dependent variable is measured in $1,000s, the coefficients suggest
that each additional faculty member is associated with about $10,000 in additional funding,
each postdoc is also associated with between $10,000 and $15,000, and each additional
doctorate awarded is associated with about $5,000 in additional funding. For faculty and
graduate student numbers we cannot reject the hypothesis that the true effect is zero. But in
all specifications the effect of additional postdoctoral scholars is both economically large and
statistically significant.
The ability of universities to mobilize additional funding from their own institutional
resources or through corporate or philanthropic funds could be either a complement to or
substitute for federal funding. If higher levels of non-federal funding increase scientific capacity
and signal higher faculty quality, then they should act as a complement, inducing additional
federal support. On the other hand, the availability of non-federal funds may substitute for
federal support, reducing the volume of research proposals submitted by an institution or
discouraging agencies from awarding funds, in which case we would expect a negative effect on
federal R&D funding. As we noted earlier, several previous studies have argued that nonfederal R&D funding generally serves to leverage additional federal R&D funding. Our

15
estimates also imply a positive and sometimes statistically significant effect of non-federal
expenditures on federal funding. The estimated coefficients imply that every $100 dollars of
non-federal funding leads to between $5 and $8 dollars of federal funding.
To measure research quality we have included both the number of publications in the
prior year and the average number of citations to these publications. Holding faculty, postdoc,
and graduate student numbers constant, higher numbers of publications should indicate more
research activity, and more highly cited publications should be an indicator of higher impact
publications. 7 Both these quality measures enter positively, but only publication numbers are
statistically significant. The point estimates indicate that each additional publication in year t-1,
is associated with approximately $4,000 of additional research funding in year t.
For consistent estimation, the Arellano-Bond estimation procedure requires that the
errors, it, be serially uncorrelated beyond order 1. This assumption can be tested using the
fitted residuals (Cameron and Trivedi 2010, p. 300). At the bottom of the table we report the Zstatistic for the test of this hypothesis along the probability of obtaining a value at least this big.
We do not reject the hypothesis of zero autocorrelation for any of our models.

3.4 Identification
We have shown the correlation between faculty, students, postdocs, publications, and
lagged funding on current research funding. It is difficult to imagine a quasi-experimental
setting that leads to an exogenous change in the number of faculty or research productivity at a
7

The number of citations received is measured over a three year window following publication,
so this number would not be known to reviewers involved in the merit review process. Rather
it is an indicator of the importance of the articles that these reviewers might infer from other
sources.

16
given university while holding other characteristics constant to observe an unambiguously
causal effect. But it is important to recall that the coefficient estimates we have reported are
estimated from a panel model in first differences. Hence all of the effects reflect the impact on
funding level at a single university of variations over time in the explanatory variables. All timeinvariant effects such as institutional reputation or persistent differences in quality and size are
absorbed in the panel fixed-effects, which are removed by first differencing. Moreover,
because the explanatory variables are lagged one period, there is little chance for reverse
causation. Prior years R&D funding might account for higher rates of publication activity in year
t, but it is hard to see how articles published in year t could be caused by funding that was not
received until year t+1.
The most plausible channel through which such reverse causation might enter is
through feedbacks between funding and the number of postdoctoral scholars. Because
postdocs are typically hired for several years, it is possible that a shock to funding in year t-1
might increase both the number of postdocs employed in year t-1 and volume of research
expenditures in year t. In Table 4 we address this problem by using instrumental variables for
the number of postdocs. Consistent with the dynamic panel model framework, our instruments
are longer lags of the postdoc variable. After reproducing the baseline results in column (1) the
next three columns report IV specifications using 3, 5, and 10 lagged values of postdocs as
instruments. Point estimates of the coefficients are quite stable regardless of the number of
instruments, but the magnitude of the effect of postdoctoral scholars increases with more
instruments. With fewer IVs this effect is not statistically significant, but when we use 10 lags
of the variable it becomes statistically significant at the 10 percent level.

3.5 Stability Across University Types
So far we have concentrated on estimating an average within-institution effect on
funding across our full sample of universities. But the sample comprises different types of
institutions and it is reasonable to suppose that the effects of the research capacity, nonfederal funds, and research quality might vary from one type of institution to another. By
splitting our sample based on research intensity (whether the university is classified as a
Carnegie Research I institution or not) and control (public or private), we can gain some insight
into this question.
Table 5 compares estimates of equation (3) for each of these subsamples of universities
to the baseline estimates obtained for the full sample. Columns 2 and 3 report results
separately for public and private universities, while Columns 4 and 5 show separate regression
for institutions classified as Carnegie Research I and not Research I. The estimates for nonResearch I universities reported in Column 4a violate the assumption of zero autocorrelation of
the residuals at order 2. The solution to this problem is to add additional lags of the dependent
variable until the assumption is satisfied. In Column 4b we show that after including a third lag
of funding this assumption is satisfied. This modification does not, however, greatly affect any
of the other estimated coefficients.

Insert Table 5 about here

18

As the summary data in Table 2 make clear, a number of the explanatory variables are
correlated with research intensity or control, but comparison of the constant term across the
different samples suggests that in the hypothetical case where these explanatory variables
were held constant private universities would on average receive higher levels of federal
funding ($2.82 million vs. $2.05 million). Interestingly the differences between Research I and
non-Research I universities are quite small ($2.71 million vs. $2.51 million) once other factors
are controlled. Turning to the explanatory variables, with the smaller sample sizes the precision
of many of the point estimates falls so effects are not always statistically significant at standard
levels. Interestingly, however the magnitude of the effect of the number of postdoctoral
scholars is similar to the baseline estimates except in the case of private universities. For the
latter subsample, our estimates suggest that variations in numbers of postdocs are not an
important determinant of funding variation. On the other hand, variations in publications enter
as a strong and positively significant factor for private universities, and have a much smaller and
consistently statistically insignificant effect for public universities.8

8

Numbers of publications and numbers of postdocs are highly positively correlated, and
dropping publications from the estimation for private universities results in a much stronger
and statistically significant effect on the postdoc variable. This suggests that for private
institutions, past research productivity is a more accurate predictor of future funding levels
than scientific capacity, but that scientific capacity plays an important role in determining
productivity.

4. Discussion

Federal R&D funding is an essential ingredient supporting individual researchers and the
university research enterprise. Ask any university scientist about the importance of external
research funding and she will tell you that it is essential to supporting her laboratory. Without
funding it would not be possible to get the research done; there would be no money to pay for
supplies or hire the graduate students and postdocs essential to conducting the experiments.
One illustration of the importance of funding for the research enterprise is provided by a survey
we recently conducted of academic chemists in the United States. In that survey we asked how
a 25 percent reduction in funding would affect their research activities; over 75% of
respondents said lower funding would result in fewer publications, 81% said they would be able
to support fewer graduate students, 68% said they would employ fewer postdocs and 40% said
that they would generate fewer patents.9 Consistent with these views most econometric
estimates find a positive effect of federal funding on research outputs (e.g., Payne and Siow
2003, Jacob and Lefgren 2011, Popp 2015, Rosenbloom et al. 2015).The results reported above
represent a first attempt to understand how key inputs to the production of scientific
knowledge—the quantity and quality of scientific personnel and other, non-federal resources—
influence the distribution of federal funds. Consistent with the basic premises of the merit
review process, we find evidence that increased capacity, especially greater numbers of
postdocs, and higher numbers of publications are linked to increased funding levels.

The survey was conducted during the Spring of 2014. Email invitations to participate in an
online survey were sent to all faculty in the United States with valid email addresses listed in
the American Chemical Society’s Directory of Graduate Research for 2013. Invitations were
sent to 7,438 individuals and we received 1,544 completed survey responses.

20
The effect of postdocs on research funding is rather striking. The National Institutes of
Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) define the postdoctoral scholar to be
“individuals engaged in temporary periods of mentored advanced training to enhance the
professional skills and research independence needed to pursue their chosen career paths.”10
However, the postdoc is controversial, and some have labeled the postdoc as “exploitation”
given the low salaries, lack of benefits, and high rates of foregone earnings (Stephan 2013, Kahn
and Ginther 2017). Stephan (2013) argued that the postdocs persists because faculty can hire
inexpensive and temporary employees to conduct research. Our analysis provides the
university’s rationale for postdoctoral scholars: postdocs increase the future stream of research
funding flowing to the university.
For public university leaders seeking to increase their share of the federal R&D pie, our
results suggest that increasing the number of postdoctoral fellows and greater investments of
non-federal funding for R&D will increase competitiveness. Correlation is not, of course, the
same as causation. Our dynamic panel estimates account for a number of potential sources of
reverse causation. In the absence of truly experimental variation or sources of large exogenous
shocks to chemistry funding, however, it is difficult to argue that we have isolated truly causal
relationships. Nonetheless, our results suggest that such relationships exist and ought to
encourage further efforts to investigate them.

5. Conclusion

http://grants.nih.gov/training/Reed_Letter.pdf

21
This article offers an initial exploration of a topic that has so far been largely neglected
in the Science of Science Policy literature: the factors influencing the allocation of federal R&D
funding at the level of an individual scientific discipline. Past discussion has tended to focus on
total R&D funding, an approach that makes it difficult to incorporate measures of scientific
merit or scale. We have focused here on one discipline, chemistry, but believe that it would be
fruitful to expand this research program to make comparisons across other disciplines.
The results of our investigation suggest that there are a number of systematic
relationships that influence variations in funding across institutions, and these correspond to
factors that were a priori expected to be important. Numbers of postdoctoral scholars, for
example are both an indicator of the human capital capacity of an institution and an important
input into the preparation of competitive research funding proposals. Since postdoctoral
scholars are highly dependent on external funding to cover their salaries, it makes considerable
sense that institutions that have large numbers of postdoctoral scholars would attract more
funding. Similarly, given the importance of physical capital and specialized equipment the
evidence that we find of positive effects of non-federally funded R&D on subsequent federal
support makes a great deal of sense. Finally, given the emphasis on investigator qualifications
it makes considerable sense that past publication positively affects subsequent funding. On the
other hand, one might note that all of these relationships suggest mechanisms through which
past success supports future success, a version of the so-called “Matthew effect, “where the
rich get richer. However, the considerably mobility of institutions in funding ranks over time
argues against a pure “Matthew effect” explanation. With the available data it is not possible
to tease apart these two alternative interpretations of our results. On the other hand, the

22
relationships we find suggest a need for further investigation using higher resolution data that
will enable a sharper distinction between these interpretations.

Data Appendix
All data used in our analysis are available online. The dataset and documentation have have
been deposited in the University of Kansas Digital Repository and can be accessed here:
https://doi.org/10.17161/1808.18234. This appendix provides a brief explanation of the
sources of each of the major data elements in our analysis and how they were linked.

Research & Development Expenditures
These data are derived from the National Science Foundation’s Survey of Research and
Development Expenditures at Universities and Colleges/Higher Education Research and
Development Survey (http://webcaspar.nsf.gov). Data are available annually since 1973 for
total and federally funded R&D expenditures by discipline. They are obtained from survey
responses completed by institutions of higher education, which are responsible for classifying
all research expenditures by discipline. We computed non-federally funded R&D expenditures
as the difference between total and federally funded R&D expenditures.
Sample institutions were selected from the universe of institutions represented in this
data by summing real federally funded R&D expenditures (in prices of 2005) for chemistry and
chemical engineering between 1990 and 2009 and then ranking institutions in descending
order. We initially selected the top 150 institutions but as described in the text were obliged to
drop three of these from the analysis because of inconsistencies in coverage. Before adopting
this sampling strategy, we examined several other rankings, using total R&D expenditures and
using nominal rather than real expenditures. The lists produced in each case were quite similar.

24
The full list of institutions included in the study in declining order of federally-funded chemistry
R&D expenditures is provided in Table 1.
Institutions report these data for the fiscal year corresponding most closely to the
federal fiscal year. In most cases this is likely to run from July of one year to June of the
following calendar year. Data are labeled with the calendar year in which the fiscal year ends.
Hence data for 2009 most likely cover expenditures from July 2008 through June 2009.
In addition to the expenditures data, this source also contains information on type of
control (private or public) and standardized Carnegie Classifications that we use to categorize
university types.

Doctorates Awarded and Postdoctoral Researchers
These data are derived from the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of
Health Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering (graduate
student survey) which is conducted annually by the National Center for Science and Engineering
Statistics. The survey is conducted in the fall semester of each academic year and data are
collected at the department level. These data are available from http://webcaspar.nsf.gov.
The level of institutional detail provided in this survey is greater than in the R&D
expenditure data. In the latter survey a number of multi-campus state systems report a single
aggregated number. To link the data sets, we were obliged to aggregate the data in the student
survey to match the level of aggregation of the R&D data.

25
Publications and Citations
Publication and citation data were computed by Thomson Reuters, Research Analytics
from the data underlying the Web of Science publication and citation database. Thomson
Reuters subject area experts categorize journals into subject classes based on detailed analysis
of the content and focus of the journals. See
http://wokinfo.com/media/essay/journal_selection_essay-en.pdf for additional details
regarding the selection process used by Thomson Reuters in compiling the Web of Science data.
The Web of Science is relatively selective about which journals are included, reflecting subject
expert judgment and objective metrics of journal impact. Our research began with the full set
of journals that Thomson Reuters categorizes as Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. We also
conducted an analysis of all journal titles indexed by Thomson Reuters and added a small
number of additional journals that contain significant chemistry content.
We then worked closely with Thomson Reuters staff to match publications by author
affiliation to universities in our sample. In addition to institution name, we considered city,
state and zip code information associated with authors to verify the accuracy of article linkages.
After verifying the full list of publications, Thomson Reuters analyzed them to produce
summary statistics describing the number of publications each year produced by each
institution, the number of citations that those publications received in 3 and 5 year windows
beginning with the publication year, and a variety of other citation related metrics.

Notes: All specifications estimated using the XTABOND procedure in STATA 14, using
robust standard errors and specifying a maximum of 5 lags of the dependent variable
as instruments. All regressions include year fixed effects. In specifications (2)-(4)
Postdocs(t-1) is treated as endogenous, and instrumented with lagged values.
Specifications differ only in the number of lags used. Specification (2) uses 3 lags as
instruments, specification (3) uses 5 lags, and specification (4) uses 10 lags.
