ABSTRACT
This paper evaluates a randomized controlled trial of the Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP)
program conducted in Memphis, TN in 1990. NFP offers home visits conducted by nurses for
disadvantaged first-time mothers during pregnancy and early childhood. We test NFP treatment
effects using permutation-based inference that accounts for the NFP randomization protocol. Our
methodology is valid for small samples and corrects for multiple-hypothesis testing. We also
analyze the underlying mechanisms generating these treatment effects. We decompose NFP
treatment effects into components associated with the intervention-enhanced parenting and early
childhood skills. The NFP improves home investments, parenting attitudes and mental health for
mothers of infants at age 2. At age 6, the NFP boosts cognitive skills for both genders and socioemotional skills for females. These treatment effects are explained by program-induced
improvements in maternal traits and early-life family investments. At age 12, the treatment
effects for males (but not for females) persist in the form of enhanced achievement test scores.
Treatment effects are largely explained by enhanced cognitive skills at age 6. Our evidence of
pronounced gender differences in response to early childhood interventions contributes to a
growing literature on this topic.

Introduction

Home visiting programs are widely used to improve the well-being of disadvantaged pregnant
women and their children (Currie and Rossin-Slater, 2015; Howard and Brooks-Gunn, 2009a).
In 2010, the United States expanded federal funding for the establishment of the Maternal,
Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program (MIECHV Program) to support state
implementation of early childhood home visiting programs. At present, funding for MIECHV
Program has been been reauthorized, with bipartisan support for the program. Between
2012–2015, the MIECHV program served more than 300,000 disadvantaged families and
children in the US.1
The Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) is widely considered the primary MIECHV Program among evidence-based home visiting models. The NFP offers prenatal and early childhood care to disadvantaged, unmarried, first-time mothers. Treatment consists of home visits
starting during pregnancy and lasting until two years after birth. The NFP home visits are
conducted by professional registered nurses with at least of a Bachelor of Science degree in
nursing. They have formal training and follow a detailed curriculum of activities specific to
the different stages of pregnancy and child development (Currie and Rossin-Slater, 2015).
The NFP aims to improve the long-term success of disadvantaged children. It operates by
promoting healthy maternal behaviors and by fostering parenting skills. Prior to being implemented at scale, three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were performed to assess the
impact of the NFP in different populations.2
Today, NFP surrogates operate in 43 states across the U.S. and have provided service for
more than 200, 000 families since 1996. A version of NFP is currently operating in the U.K.
and Germany (Robling et al., 2016; Sandner et al., 2017).
Most of the NFP literature focuses on three social experiments targeting poor high-risk
1

Between 2010-2014, the MIECHV Program provided $1.5 billion to states for implementing home visiting
programs. In 2015, a two year extension was approved to continue supporting these programs until 2017.
The program is currently up for renewal.

pregnant females. The first NFP trial occurred in Elmira (1978) and its sample consists of
primary non-Hispanic white mothers. The second trial took place in Memphis (1990) and
targeted mainly non-Hispanic blacks. A third intervention occurred in Denver (1994) and
overrepresented Hispanic participants. This paper uses data from the Memphis randomized
control trial to examine NFP impacts through age 12, and to investigate the mechanisms
producing the treatment effects.
There are several previous evaluations of the NFP that examine its effects on a range of
domains, including maternal and child health, child development, parenting, and family economic self-sufficiency (Avellar et al., 2011; Daro, 2006; Olds, 2012).3 However, the literature
does not account for features of the randomization protocol (such as stratification), does not
control for multiple-hypothesis testing (i.e., control for “cherry picking”) and does not analyze the underlying channels generating treatment effects. Our analysis presents a rigorous
examination that addresses these issues. The Memphis randomized control trial is the only
NFP intervention that collects detailed item-level data necessary to analyze different channels of influence. In particular, the Memphis trial gathered rich information on mother and
child well-being from pregnancy up to age 12. It includes information on maternal behavior,
home environments, parenting, children’s cognitive and socio-emotional skills measured at
ages 2 and 6, and middle childhood outcomes such as achievement and behavior problems,
measured at age 12.
We contribute to the existing NFP literature in three ways. First, our paper is the first
to conduct inference that accounts for the features of the NFP randomization protocol and
addresses the problem of cherry picking. We use permutation-based inference and implement
multiple-hypothesis testing adjustments using the step down procedure of Romano and Wolf
(2005). We show that most of the findings from previous papers survive permutation testing.
However, many fewer treatment effects survive corrections for multiple-hypothesis testing.
Second, our paper is the first to analyze the effects of the NFP by gender, following
3

Our results broadly corroborate the findings of Olds (2012) while producing new insights on the NFP
intervention.

the previous literature that has found gender differences in early-childhood program effects
(see Elango et al., 2016; Garcı́a et al., 2017b; Heckman et al., 2010 and Garcı́a, Heckman,
and Ziff, 2017). Third, this is the first paper that conducts a mediation analysis of NFP
treatment effects. Following the methodology developed by Heckman et al. (2013), we decompose statistically significant treatment effects into interpretable components associated
with program-induced changes in children’s early skills and parental investments. We estimate the channels underlying treatment effects at age 6 (using maternal skills and investment
effects at the end of the program as mediators) and at age 12 (using the program effects at
age 6 as mediators).
We find statistically significant treatment effects of NFP on home environments, parenting attitudes, and maternal mental health for parents of both boys and girls at age 2.
At age 6, the program improved cognitive skills for both boys and girls, while it enhanced
early socio-emotional skills for girls. These treatment effects arise from program-induced
improvements in maternal traits and early-life family investments at age 2. The treatment
effects for males persist through age 12. Treated males outperform controls on a range of
cognitive achievement scores. We find that 40%–60% of male treatment effects at age 12 can
be explained by enhanced cognitive skills measured at age 6. The program has much weaker
long-term effects for girls. This finding is consistent with the evidence in Elango et al. (2016)
and Garcı́a et al. (2017a). This paper contributes to the literature on the positive influences
of early childhood interventions. We show that parenting matters. Specifically, we find that
program-induced improvements in maternal mental health (reduction in maternal anxiety
and improvement on mastery/self-control) and program-induced enhancement of parenting
skills are strong channels underlying program effects on children’s skills. We also present
evidence that the NFP had long-lasting effects on cognitive skills for boys, which contrast
with the limited evidence on the persistent effects of preschool interventions on cognition.
One possible explanation for the long-term effects of NFP on cognitive skills for boys is the
health effects of the home visiting program on birth weight. This explains a large share

5

of the age 12 program impact on cognition. This finding suggests that early childhood interventions that start before birth have the potential to affect cognitive skill formation for
which sensitive periods occur in utero and in the first years of life (see Nelson, 2012).
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides information on
the experimental design, background variables and measured outcomes of the NFP Memphis
trial. Section 3 explains our inferential approach. Section 4 presents our empirical results.
Section 5 describes the methodology used to decompose treatment effects. Section 6 presents
our mediation analysis. Section 7 concludes.

Experimental Design and Background

The NFP Memphis trial was initiated in 1990. The main goals of NFP are: (1) improvement
of maternal and fetal health during pregnancy; (2) development of parenting skills; and (3)
planning of social and economic aspects of maternal life through counseling services (Olds,
2002; Olds et al., 1997).
Visits started during pregnancy and continued until the newborn reached the age of 2.
During these visits, nurses encouraged mothers to adopt a healthy diet and eliminate the use
of tobacco, alcohol, and illegal drugs. Nurses also taught mothers to recognize complications
in pregnancy and to administer adequate prenatal care. After delivery, nurses promoted
infant health care and good parenting skills. Mothers were instructed on how to interact
with their children in order to foster emotional and cognitive development. NFP further
assisted mothers in the process of establishing life goals related to work, education and
future pregnancies.
Table 1 summarizes the main elements of NFP. We discuss its features in detail. We
compare the designs of the different NFP studies in Appendix B.

Eligibility
The NFP Memphis trial recruited pregnant women from June 1, 1990 to August 31,
1991 through the Memphis-Shelby County Tennessee Health Department. Eligible mothers
satisfied the following biological criteria: (1) less than 29 weeks of pregnancy; (2) no previous
live birth; and (3) no chronic illnesses that could contribute to fetal-growth retardation or
preterm delivery. They also satisfied two or more of the following socio-economic criteria:
(1) unmarried; (2) less than 12 years of education; and (3) unemployed.
Sample
The total sample includes 1, 290 invited participants and 1, 138 mothers effectively enrolled. The majority of the participants were African-American (92%), unmarried (97%),
low income (95%), and under 18 years old (64%). Mothers who participated in the program
were more likely to be younger and African-American and less likely to have completed high
school compared to mothers who refused to participate (Kitzman et al., 1997).
Treatment
The mothers who agreed to participate in the trial were randomized into four different
groups that differed by treatment:
• Group 1: Round-trip transportation from their homes to prenatal session appointments
(sample size: 166).
• Group 2: Developmental screening and referral services when their babies were age 6,
12, and 24 months, in addition to the benefits of Group 1 (sample size: 514).4
• Group 3: Nurse visits during pregnancy, one visit when in the hospital and one visit
at home after childbirth, in addition to the benefits of Group 2 (sample size: 230).
• Group 4: Nurse home visits during pregnancy and until the child’s second birthday, in
addition to the benefits of Group 2 (sample size: 228).
4
An infant specialist hired by the research project screened the children for sensory and developmental
problems and referred those with suspected problems to other specialists for further evaluation and treatment.

There are no available data on the participants of Groups 1 and 3 after the child’s birth,
as those participants were not followed. Our paper only uses data on the participants who
were originally assigned to Groups 2 or 4. These treatment groups comply with the selection
of treatment groups used in previous evaluations other NFP trials. (See Appendix B.)
Henceforth, we term Group 4 as the treatment group and Group 2 as control group. It is
worth noting that Group 2 received some benefits in the form of developmental screening.
Table 2 presents a summary of selected baseline characteristics for the treatment and
control groups by gender of the child. The table shows that pre-program characteristics are
fairly balanced across treatment groups. Some exceptions are that treated mothers have
lower income, lower likelihood of being in school, lower employment status of the household
head, and higher grandmother support compared to mothers in the control group.5
Randomization protocol
The NFP randomization was performed within strata defined by 5 characteristics: (1)
maternal race (African-American vs non-African-American); (2) maternal age (< 17, 17−18,
> 18 years ); (3) gestational age at enrollment (< 20, ≥ 20 weeks); (4) employment status
of the head of household; and (5) geographic region of residence.6 Appendix A provides a
detailed description of the randomization protocol.
Attrition
Post-randomization dropout was rare during the program period: four women in both
treatment and control groups refused further participation in the intervention after randomization. There were 487 live births in the control group (out of 514 pregnant mothers) and
214 live births in the treatment group (out of 228 pregnant mothers). There were 27 miscarriages in the control group and 14 in the treatment group. Table E.1 in Appendix E shows
the percentage of available data (retention rates) by gender and age of follow-up interviews.
The differences in attrition by group are not statistically significant. When the children were

We use race, mother’s age, marital status, family income, employment, education, fertility, delinquency, maternal mental health, family support, and maternal risk behavior as
background information.
Outcomes
Data from the NFP Memphis trial were collected at multiple time points including birth
(e.g., placenta and birth weight) and when the child was 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 6 years,
and 12 years old. Table 3 summarizes the data available for each period of child development.
See Appendix C for a detailed description of each of the NFP measures. Data on home
environment (HOME) and parenting skills (Bavolek) were collected at 6 months, 1 year, and
2 years old.8 Data on socio-emotional skills (CBCL), hospital records9 , and maternal mental
health are available at age 2.10 Maternal mental health was assessed at age 2 by the Rand
Mental Health Inventory and the Rosenberg and Pearlin Scales.11 Child cognition (KABC,
PPVT, WISC-III)12 and socio-emotional skills (CBCL, MSSB) were measured at age 6.13
Outcomes at age 12 consist of child’s internalizing and externalizing behaviors (CBCL),

Tables E.1–E.3 in Appendix E present a statistical description of retention levels and baseline variables.
Table E.1 presents the statistical description of retention levels by gender and time of survey. Table E.2
presents the statistical description of selected pre-program variables after 6 years. Table E.3 investigates the
distribution of baseline variables after 12 years.

HOME stands for the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment. It measures the resources
and time allocated to cognitive and emotional stimuli. Bavolek is the Adult-Adolescent Parenting Inventory
that measures parental skills and child-rearing attitudes such as abusive and neglecting parenting.
9
Those include health care usage such as hospitalizations and medical appointments.
10
Child-Behavior Checklist (CBCL) measures child behavioral and emotional problems reported by the
mother (Association and on DSM-IV., 2000).
11
These instruments measure maternal psychological skills. The Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale assesses
global self-worth (Rosenberg, 1965). The Pearlin Mastery Scale measures personal mastery over life outcomes
(Pearlin and Schooler, 1978). The Rand Mental Health Inventory captures psychological distress and wellbeing factors including anxiety, depression, and positive well-being (Veit and Ware, 1983).
12
KABC stands for the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children and focuses on problem solving and
language skills. PPVT stands for Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) and tests receptive vocabulary. WISC-III stands for the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III) and measures short-term
memory and visual perception.
13
MSSB stands for the McArthur Story Stem Battery which measures storytelling affection and coherence (Olds et al., 2004). MSSB measures four dimensions of socio-emotional skills: (1) child deregulated
aggression; (2) parental warmth and empathy; (3) child emotional integration; and (4) child anxiety.

Notes: This table presents a summary of the data available for the analysis of treatment effects in NFP mediators and
outcomes. The first column presents the name of the outcome or instrument. The remaining columns specify the time of
survey according to the age of the child in participating families. Additional information on the description of the available
instruments of the NFP data can be seen at Appendix C.

Inference

Previous literature uses classical inference that relies on large sample (asymptotic) assumptions to make statistical inference about NFP. Heckman et al. (2010) show that the classical
approach may generate biased inference when applied to small sample sizes, if the distribution of the data is skewed or, more generally, non-normal. Permutation-based tests provide
a solution to these potential problems.
Permutation tests are often called distribution-free as they do not require parametric assumptions about the data-generating process and are valid for any sample size. Permutation

Comprehensive Assessment Program, an achievement test administered by Tennessee schools after 3rd grade.

tests exploit an exchangeability property that arises from the randomization protocol. If the
null hypothesis of no treatment effect is true, then permuting treated and control outcomes
within strata (blocks) formed by the variables used in the randomization protocol should
not alter the distribution of the observed outcomes. This insight enables us to evaluate the
p-value for the null hypothesis of no treatment effect by using the fraction of the re-sampled
data that generates a test statistic greater than the one obtained from the original data. This
procedure is called a block-permutation test. In the case of NFP, the baseline variables used
in the randomization protocol are: maternal age and race, gestational age at enrollment,
employment status of the head of the household, and geographic region. See Appendix D
for a detailed discussion of the permutation test we use.
Another concern in evaluating and testing treatment effects is the imbalance of baseline
characteristics across treatment and control groups. We address this issue by assuming
linearity in background variables in the outcome equations to control for imbalances. We
use the approach suggested by Freedman and Lane (1983) which, according to Anderson and
Legendre (1999), provides the most reliable results among a range of permutation methods
for linear models. See Appendix D.1 for a detailed description of this method. We control
for maternal height, household income, grandmother support, maternal parenting attitudes,
and whether the mother is currently enrolled in school.
In addition, the large number of outcomes associated with NFP creates the possibility of
“cherry picking,” namely the selective reporting of statistically significant treatment effects
that may occur by chance. We account for the multiplicity of outcomes by using a multiplehypothesis testing procedure based on the stepdown method of Romano and Wolf (2005).
The method generates p-values that control for the Family-wise Error Rate (FWER): that is,
the probability of rejecting at least one true hypothesis out of a set of multiple hypotheses.
Stepdown p-values are more conservative than single hypothesis p-values, since they take into
account the multiplicity of outcomes. For a detailed description of the stepdown method,
see Appendix D.

13

Table 5 presents a summary of the inference analysis and compares the number of statistically significant outcomes using three methods of inference. The first method is classical inference for single-hypotheses, which relies on large sample assumptions. The second method
is the single-hypothesis block-permutation test previously discussed. The third method applies the stepdown method, which accounts for multiple outcomes. We find that correcting
for the randomization protocol and the imbalance of baseline variables using permutation
tests often produces sharper inferences compared to those obtained from classical inference
procedures. As expected, fewer outcomes survive corrections for multiple-hypothesis testing.
The next section explain the results of our inference reanalysis in more detail.

Estimated Treatment Effects

Table 4 presents a synopsis of the overall significance of the NFP treatment effects. The table
shows the percentage of outcomes for which treatment effects are statistically significant at
different significance levels by gender. These percentages are larger than what would be
expected to arise by chance.

Note: This table presents the percentage of statistically significant treatment effects based on a selection of 157 outcomes in
the NFP study. Among those, 5 outcomes are surveyed at birth; 1 at age 6 months old; 2 at age 1; 51 outcomes are surveyed
at age 2; 37 outcomes are surveyed at age 6; 3 outcomes are surveyed at age 9; and 58 outcomes are surveyed at age 12.

Table 5 summarizes the inference results on treatment effects presented in Tables 6-

14

10. According to Table 5, the NFP intervention significantly improved maternal mental
health, home environment and parenting skills. On average, treated boys were healthier at
birth and experienced an increase in cognitive abilities by age 6. We find that the NFP
intervention generated stronger effects on socio-emotional skills for girls and stronger effects
on academic achievement for boys. By age 12, treated boys outperformed controls in math
and reading achievement. Treated girls experienced an improvement in cognitive and socioemotional skills at age 6. At age 12, treated girls had a lower body-mass index (BMI), but
the estimated treatment effects are not significantly different from the control group in other
measures. We also find that controlling for background characteristics increases the precision
of treatment effect estimates, often leading to statistical significance in multiple-hypothesis
inference.16 Tables F.7-F.10 of Appendix F show that our findings hold when correcting for
attrition using the inverse probability weighting method.17 Treatment effect estimates and
inferences follow closely the results presented in Tables 6-10. We conclude that the correction
for attrition does not play a substantial role in the evaluation of the NFP intervention.
Tables 6-10 display the estimation and inference of treatment effects by outcome category
and gender. We divide outcomes into five categories: child health, family environments, child
cognition, socio-emotional development, and achievement scores. Outcomes are divided into
blocks of variables within each category. Each block contains variables of similar content
surveyed at the same period. Each table consists of six columns for each gender. The first
four columns display the basic statistics for each block of outcomes: (1) control group mean,
(2) conditional difference in mean, (3) conditional effect size, and (4) (classic) asymptotic
p-value. The fifth column presents the one-sided single hypothesis permutation p-value that
accounts for the characteristics of the NFP randomization protocol as described in Section 2.
The sixth column shows the adjusted stepdown p-values that correct for multiple-hypothesis
testing. In the rest of this section we discuss each outcome category in more detail.

Note: This table presents a summary of the treatment effect findings from our inference methods displayed in Tables 6-9. The outcomes/mediators are organized into six categories: (A) Child’s Health;
(B) Family Environment at Age 2; (C) Cognitive Skills at Age 6; (D) Socio-emotional Skills at Age 6; (E) Achievement Scores and Behavior at 12; (F) Parents Behavior. The first column presents the
name of the variable that can be either analysed as an outcome or a mediator. Those include psychological instruments described in Section 2. The second column displays the child’s age at time of
assessment. The third column displays the number of measures being examined within each outcome/instrument. The fourth column gives the mediator classification. The last columns summarize the
findings by gender. The table displays four columns for males and females. The first three columns display the number of statistically significant treatment effects according to the following inference
methods: (1) asymptotic p-values, (2) block permutation, and (3) multiple-hypothesis testing (MHT) correction using the stepdown method of Romano and Wolf (2005). The fourth column summarizes
whether the estimated average treatment effect is statistically significant and its direction. Significant Effects means that the estimated average treatment effect is statistically significant in at least two
subscales within the classification group. Mixed effects means that the estimate of the average treatment effect is statistically significant at least one sub-scale within classification but results are not
robust under multiple-hypothesis testing. No effect means that the estimates of the intervention average treatment effects are not statistically significant within the outcome. The signs (+) and (−)
denote the expected direction (positive or negative) of estimated treatment effects. TCAP stands for the Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program. PIAT stands for Peabody Individual
Achievement test.

Outcomes

Table 5:

Table 6 displays the NFP results on child health. The first block shows treatment effects
on birth outcomes. Treated boys were relatively healthier at birth: there are strong positive
effects on placenta weight, birth weight, head circumference, length and gestational age at
delivery. The results are both statistically significant at the 5% significance level and robust
to correcting for multiple-hypothesis testing. Treated boys are, on average, 193 grams heavier
and were delivered 0.7 weeks later than their control counterparts. In contrast, there are
no statistically significant effects for girls at birth. The second block focuses on child health
outcomes at age 12. We find statistically significant treatment effects on body mass index
(BMI) for girls. Boys have fewer statistically significant results at age 12, which do not
survive multiple-hypothesis corrections.
Family environment
Table 7 displays results on family environments and parenting. The first two blocks
display treatment effects on parenting beliefs and the home environment for ages 1 and
2. Treatment effects are statistically significant for both genders and robust to application
of the stepdown procedure. By age 2, the NFP improved maternal parenting attitudes
regarding non-abusive and non-neglecting behaviors (Bavolek Inventory). We find effect
sizes of approximately 0.3 standard deviations (SDs) for mothers of both females and males.
In addition, the intervention improved home environments by 0.17 SDs for males and by 0.3
SDs for females. This positive impact on home environments is mainly reflected in treatment
effects on HOME sub-scales associated with variety in daily stimulation, and provision of
appropriate playing material. Additionally, we find statistically significant treatment effects
on maternal mental health. Mothers of female children reported less anxiety, and better
emotional stability, self-esteem, and mastery skills. The effects range between 0.2 and 0.3
SDs. Mothers of male children also experienced an improvement in their mastery skills.
However, this effect does not survive multiple-hypothesis corrections. The bottom block
examines the treatment effects on the cost of welfare program participation. The NFP
reduced the total cost of participation in AFDC/TANF, SNAP (food stamps), and Medicaid
17

for mothers with male children at age 12. Reduction in SNAP enrollment survive the multiple
hypothesis correction for males. Additionally, one of the NFP program objectives was to
improve maternal planning of future pregnancies. Table 8 shows the effects of the program on
the probability of having subsequent births after the first child at different periods between
ages 0 and 12. The estimated treatment effects are imprecise and do not survive multiplehypothesis testing correction.
Child Cognitive Outcomes
Table 9 displays the NFP results on cognition and achievement for children at ages 6
and 12. The first block analyzes the Kaufmann Assessment Battery for Children (KABC)
inventory measured at age 6. In particular, it displays the subtests that are part of the
mental processing composite (sequential and simultaneous processing). NFP increased IQ
for both genders. However, only the results for boys are robust to controlling for multiplehypothesis testing. The second block displays outcomes on some cognitive-related subscales
from the KABC, and the results are robust for both boys and girls. Also, treated boys
scored 0.25 SDs higher in the PPVT (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test) than their control
counterparts.
To summarize effects on child cognition at age 6, we estimate two factor scores. The first
factor captures both cognition and achievement, which is derived using the three instruments
KABC, PPVT and WISC-III. The second factor captures a pure measure of cognitive skills
that comes from the KABC mental processing composite. The treatment effect sizes are
larger for boys than girls. For instance, NFP increased cognitive skills by 0.27 SDs for boys
versus 0.12 SDs for girls.
Achievement Scores
The bottom part of Table 9 presents the treatment effects on achievement outcomes at
age 12 (reading and math). The results, again, are stronger for treated boys than treated
18

girls, and are robust to the application of the stepdown procedure. Treated boys scored 0.24
SDs higher in the language section of an achievement test: the Tennessee Comprehensive
Assessment Program (TCAP). Also, NFP improved math achievement scores exclusively for
boys. Treatment effect sizes range between 0.15 and 0.22 SDs. In general, Table 9 documents
a wide variety of effects on the cognitive skills of boys and girls. These results extend previous
evaluations, which found this effect only for children born to mothers with low psychological
resources (Kitzman et al., 2010; Olds, 2012)
Child Socio-Emotional Outcomes
Table 10 displays the NFP results on socio-emotional development. The upper blocks
investigate the treatment effects on psychosocial functioning based on the Child Behavior
Checklist (CBCL) at ages 2 and 6. The results are statistically significant only for treated
girls, who had fewer affective and attention problems at age 2 (effect size: 0.24−0.33 SDs) and
fewer conduct and attention problems at age 6 (effect size: 0.27 SDs). Also, children’s socioemotional skills were assessed using the MacArthur Story Stem Battery (MSSB) surveyed
at age 6. We find that treated girls improved pro-social skills (warmth and empathy) by
0.36 SDs and decreased aggressive behavior by 0.18 SDs. The bottom block of Table 10
considers socio-emotional outcomes at age 12. Treated boys experienced less internalizing
disorders and fewer school absences (effect sizes of approximately 0.2 SDs). NFP treatment
effects differ by gender. Socio-emotional effects are stronger for girls while treatment effects
on academic achievement are statistically significant for boys.
Our results are consistent with the existing literature on home visiting programs that
have shown positive effects on children’s socio-emotional development. For example, using
reports from teachers at age 5 from the Preparing for Life (PFL) program, Doyle (2017)
found reductions in problematic behaviors but not improvement in pro-social skills. The
effects sizes ranged between 0.31 and 0.5 SDs. For the case of the NFP, results on socioemotional development at age 6 are found mainly for girls, who experienced a reduction in

19

conduct problems and aggression and an improvement in pro-social skills with effect sizes
between 0.18 and 0.36 SDs.

Note: The first column provides the outcome description. Our results are presented in six columns for each gender. The first column (Control Mean) of each result set shows
the unconditional mean for the control group. When factor scores were computed, we set the mean in the control group to zero. The second column (Difference in Means)
gives the conditional difference in means between the treatment group and the control group. As mentioned in Section 2, the control group stands for the original treatment
group 2 of the NFP experiment and the treatment group stands for the original group 4. The third column (Effect Size) presents the conditional effect size for the respective
group. The fourth column (Asymp. p-value) provides the asymptotic p-value for the one-sided single hypothesis test associated with the t-statistic for the conditional
difference in means between treatment and control groups. The fifth column (Block Permutation – Single p-value) presents the one-sided restricted permutation p-values for
the single-hypothesis testing based on the t-statistic associated with the treatment indicator in the Freedman and Lane (1983) regression as described in Section 3. By
restricted permutation we mean that permutations are done within strata defined by the baseline variables used in the randomization protocol: maternal age and race,
gestational age at enrollment, employment status of the head of the household, and geographic region. The covariates used in the Freedman and Lane (1983) regression are:
maternal height, household income, grandmother support, maternal parenting attitudes and mother currently in school. Finally, the last column (Block Permutation –
Stepdown) provides p-values that account for multiple-hypothesis testing based on the Stepdown procedure of Romano and Wolf (2005). Blocks of outcomes that are tested
jointly are separated by lines. The selection of blocks of outcomes is done on the basis of their meaning. Outcomes that share similar meaning are grouped together. Female
maternal outcomes allude to mothers whose first child is a girl. Likewise, male maternal outcomes alludes to mothers whose first child is a boy. See Table F.1 in Appendix F
for the unconditional analysis.

Note: The first column provides the outcome description. Our results are presented in six columns for each gender. The first column (Control Mean) of each result set shows
the unconditional mean for the control group. When factor scores were computed, we set the mean in the control group to zero. The second column (Difference in Means)
gives the conditional difference in means between the treatment group and the control group. As mentioned in Section 2, the control group stands for the original treatment
group 2 of the NFP experiment and the treatment group stands for the original group 4. The third column (Effect Size) presents the conditional effect size for the respective
group. The fourth column (Asymp. p-value) provides the asymptotic p-value for the one-sided single hypothesis test associated with the t-statistic for the conditional
difference in means between treatment and control groups. The fifth column (Block Permutation – Single p-value) presents the one-sided restricted permutation p-values for
the single-hypothesis testing based on the t-statistic associated with the treatment indicator in the Freedman and Lane (1983) regression as described in Section 3. By
restricted permutation we mean that permutations are done within strata defined by the baseline variables used in the randomization protocol: maternal age and race,
gestational age at enrollment, employment status of the head of the household, and geographic region. The covariates used in the Freedman and Lane (1983) regression are:
maternal height, household income, grandmother support, maternal parenting attitudes and mother currently in school. Finally, the last column (Block Permutation –
Stepdown) provides p-values that account for multiple-hypothesis testing based on the Stepdown procedure of Romano and Wolf (2005). Blocks of outcomes that are tested
jointly are separated by lines. The selection of blocks of outcomes is done on the basis of their meaning. Outcomes that share similar meaning are grouped together. Female
maternal outcomes allude to mothers whose first child is a girl. Likewise, male maternal outcomes alludes to mothers whose first child is a boy. See Table F.2 in Appendix F
for the unconditional analysis.

gives the conditional difference in means between the treatment group and the control group. As mentioned in Section 2, the control group stands for the original treatment

the single-hypothesis testing based on the t-statistic associated with the treatment indicator in the Freedman and Lane (1983) regression as described in Section 3. By
restricted permutation we mean that permutations are done within strata defined by the baseline variables used in the randomization protocol: maternal age and race,
gestational age at enrollment, employment status of the head of the household, and geographic region. The covariates used in the Freedman and Lane (1983) regression are:
maternal height, household income, grandmother support, maternal parenting attitudes and mother currently in school. Finally, the last column (Block Permutation –
Stepdown) provides p-values that account for multiple-hypothesis testing based on the Stepdown procedure of Romano and Wolf (2005). Blocks of outcomes that are tested
jointly are separated by lines. The selection of blocks of outcomes is done on the basis of their meaning. Outcomes that share similar meaning are grouped together. Female
maternal outcomes allude to mothers whose first child is a girl. Likewise, male maternal outcomes alludes to mothers whose first child is a boy. See Table F.5 in Appendix F

Understanding the Sources of NFP Treatment Effects

We decompose the NFP treatment effects on pre-pubescent outcomes into interpretable
components associated with intervention-induced changes in early-age skills. Such decompositions are sometimes called mediation analyses in the statistics literature.18 We follow
the approach of Heckman et al. (2013) who adopt a linear approximation of the outcome
equation:19

where Yi,d stands for the counterfactual outcome of agent i when the treatment is set to

d ∈ {0, 1}: d = 1 for treated and d = 0 for control. Variables (θi,d
, θi,d
) represent the skills

that can affect counterfactual outcome Yi,d (e.g., achievement test scores) of measured and
unmeasured components (measured skills are those that can be proxied by psychological
instruments collected by NFP surveys). Xi stands for observed pre-intervention variables
that we control for. Parameters αud , αm
d , βd denote vectors of coefficients that map changes
in skills and pre-program variables into changes in counterfactual outcomes. Variable i is
an unobserved zero-mean error term that is assumed to be statistically independent of all
covariates.
It is useful to rewrite Equation (1) as:

the mapping between these skills and the outcomes of interest, that is, changes in αm
1 , α0

or τ1 , τ0 . We test whether the map between measured skills and outcomes is the same for
treated and control children in Tables I.3 and I.4 of In Appendix I. We do not reject the
hypotheses associated with these restrictions.20 Thus, we can simplify Equation (2) to:

m
Yi,d = τd + αθi,d
+ βXi + ˜i,d l; d ∈ {0, 1}.

(3)

Let Di ∈ {0, 1} to denote the treatment indicator. The observed outcome Yi and observed
m
Di +
skills θim for participant i are given by Yi = Di · Yi,1 + (1 − Di ) · Yi,0 , and θim = θi,1
m
θi,0
(1−Di ), respectively. In this notation, Equation (3) can be expressed as a linear regression

equation:

Yi = τ0 + τ Di + αθim + βXi + ˜i

(4)
(5)

where ˜i = ˜i,1 Di + ˜i,0 (1 − Di ), and τ = τ1 − τ0 . Parameter τ = τ1 − τ0 captures the effect
of NFP on outcome Y that is due to the average change of unmeasured skills. This is the
mean unexplained or residual effect. The coefficients α map how changes in measured skills
θim affect the observed outcome Yi . The ordinary least squares estimates of α are unbiased
if measured skills θim and the error term ˜i are uncorrelated. A sufficient condition for unbiasedness is that measured and unmeasured skills are statistically independent conditioned
on X, D.21
Appendix I presents robustness tests of the independence relation. We perform these
tests using measures available in the data, in the same fashion as Heckman et al. (2013).
We decompose the outcome conditional-mean treatment effects of the NFP program into

We follow the inference method described in Heckman et al. (2013).
The linearity assumption enables us to require a weaker condition: mean independence.

Equation (6) expresses treatment effects as a consequence of skill enhancements that are
affected by the program.
Candidates for mediators are skills that are statistically significantly influenced by the
program (E(θ1m − θ0m ) 6= 0) and that are related with the outcomes (α 6= 0). The next
subsection describes our estimation methodology for decomposing NFP treatment effects.

5.1

Empirical Strategy to Decompose Treatment Effects

We estimate a factor model in which measured skills are expressed as factors θim using the
range of psychological instruments available in the NFP data. We extract factors to identify
the skills that are used to explain final outcomes. Factor models are particularly useful
for summarizing large sets of response variables (i.e., psychological instruments) by a small
number of latent variables (i.e., skills). Unobserved skills are estimated through a weighted
average of relevant observed measures. Factor models outperform other arbitrary indexes by
reducing the measurement error associated with factor estimation (Gorsuch, 1983).
We use a three-step procedure employed by Heckman et al. (2013). The first step consists
of estimating a linear measurement system in which latent skills are a function of measures,
that is, observed item-level data on psychological instruments. In the second step, we use
the parameters estimated in the previous step to forecast skills. These forecasts are factor
scores obtained by the Bartlett (1937) method. In the third step, we explain later outcomes
in terms of earlier skills. Specifically, we use the computed factor scores as covariates in the
linear regression represented by Equation (4). See Appendix H for a detailed explanation of
the three-step procedure used to secure estimates.
A benefit of our application of the three-step procedure is that it clearly distinguishes

28

the effect of the intervention on skills and the effect of the experimentally induced changes
in these skills on later outcomes. Our standard errors and p-values are computed using
bootstrapping, as explained in Appendix H.
The NFP psychological instruments target well-specified personality traits (see Appendix C
for a description). We incorporate this fact into our methodology by adopting a measurement
system that is based on dedicated measures. By this we mean that each observed measure
is linked to a single factor.22 We allow the latent factors to be correlated. This approach
is termed confirmatory factor analysis (Gorsuch, 1983). Similar to Heckman et al. (2013),
we correct for the measurement error that arises from using an estimated factor, i.e., factor
scores, instead of the true factor.
We conduct two sets of analyses. We first examine if child skill improvements at age 6
are mediated by variables measured at age 2. Next, we examine if child outcomes at age
12 are mediated by skills measured at age 6. The choice of potential mediators corresponds
to those intermediate skills where significant treatment effects are found in our inferential
analysis.23 At age 2, we investigate five classes of mediators: (1) non-abusive parenting
attitudes measured by the Bavolek Inventory; (2) home investments measured by the HOME
inventory; (3) maternal anxiety from the Rand Mental Health Inventory24 ; (4) maternal
self-esteem measured by the Rosenberg Scale; and (5) maternal mastery measured by the
Pearlin Scale. At age 6, we examine three broad psychological instruments as mediators: (1)
child’s cognitive skills measured by the KABC mental processing composite; (2) child’s socioemotional skills measured by the Child Behavior Checklist scales of attention and conduct
problems; (3) child’s warmth, empathy and aggression measured by the MacArthur Story
Stem Battery.
22

Heckman et al. (2013) show that the existence of at least three measures for each latent skill guarantees
identification.
23
We perform the analysis in this way since we do not have measures of both skills and investments over
time. We only observe parental investments/skills at age 2 and child’s skills at age 6 and 12. For instance,
we observe parental investments at age 2 (HOME score) but no proxy of parental investments at age 6. We
have child’s cognitive skills at age 6 (K-ABC), but not at ages 2 or 12.
24
The Rand Mental Health Inventory captures psychological distress and well-being factors. Its subscales
include anxiety, depression, and positive well-being (Veit and Ware, 1983).

Decomposing Treatment Effects

We consider two channels generating NFP treatment effects. The first channel considers maternal investments and home environments as mediators. In this mediation study, we address
the question of how parental investments respond to interventions and how such investments
affect child skills. The second channel considers how program-induced enhancements of early
skills translate to improvements in later skills.
Section 6.1 describes the mediators used in our analysis. Section 6.2 examines whether
program improvements in child skills at age 6 are mediated by the effects on health at
birth and home investments at age 2. In Section 6.3, we assess if the enhancements of
child outcomes measured at age 12 are mediated by program effects on cognitive and socioemotional skills at age 6.

6.1

NFP Effects on Skills at Ages 2 and 6

Figures 1–2 present the kernel densities of the factor scores used as mediators in our analysis.
We also display the p-value for the single hypothesis inference of no mean treatment effects
as described in Section 3.
Figure 1 shows the density of mediators at birth and age 2. It shows that NFP participation significantly increased birth weight of treated boys. At age 2, the NFP intervention
significantly improved the quality of home environment for both boys and girls (p-values:
0.07 and 0.00, respectively). It also significantly reduced abusive/neglecting maternal attitudes (p-values: 0.01 for females and 0.00 for males). The maternal characteristics for
mothers of females also improved: maternal anxiety decreased (p-value: 0.03) and maternal
self-esteem increased (p-value: 0.00). Maternal mastery skills for mothers of both boys and
girls were positively influenced as well.
Figure 2 shows the density of skills at age 6. For boys, the NFP intervention enhanced
cognition and reduced aggression (p-values: 0.02 and 0.08, respectively). For girls, the

30

program reduced attention deficits, conduct problems, and aggression (p-values: 0.06, 0.00,
and 0.00, respectively). NFP also increased cognitive and warmth or empathy skills (prosocial skills) for girls (p-values: 0.08 and 0.01, respectively).

6.2

Decomposition of Treatment Effects at Age 6

A large body of evidence corroborates the importance of early parental investments in promoting cognitive and socio-emotional development later in life (Almond and Currie, 2010;
Cunha and Heckman, 2007; Heckman, 2008). We present evidence on these claims by examining how early inputs impact skills measured at age 6. These skills are: cognition,
warmth/empathy, attention problems, conduct problems, and aggression. We only decompose skills whose treatment effects are statistically significant using the methods explained
in Section 5. Therefore, the variables used for conducting the decompositions differ by gender. Figures 3 and 4 decompose the treatment effects on these variables into components
associated with changes on factors evaluated at birth and age 2.25
We find that cognition at age 6 is enhanced through home environment and parenting
practices for boys and girls. Specifically, the program-improved home investments at age
2 explain 35% of the treatment effect on cognition at age 6 for girls (p-value 0.03). The
corresponding number for boys is 22% (p-value 0.05). Similarly, the enhanced parenting
practices explain 14% of the treatment effect on cognition for girls (p-value 0.08). For boys,
parenting practices explain 11% (p-value 0.05). Other contributions to cognition are birth
weight and maternal anxiety.26 Birth weight gains explain 14% of the cognitive treatment
effect for boys (p-value: 0.06). For girls, maternal anxiety explains 25% (p-value: 0.08).
We find that the intervention-induced changes in home environments account for 21% of
the treatment effect on female warmth/empathy (p-value: 0.01).27 Improvements in home
environments also account for 16% of the reduction in female aggression problems (p-value:
25

The p-values are computed using the bootstrap method.
Birth weight, a measure that summarizes prenatal investments and fetal development, is usually associated with childhood development (Breslau et al., 1994; Currie and Moretti, 2005).
27
This controls for birth weight, gender and a range of pre-program baseline characteristics.

0.09). Program enhancement of parenting practices at age 2 explains 9% of the reduction in
attention problems (p-value: 0.05) and 11% of the improvement in female warmth/empathy
(p-value: 0.02). For boys, parenting practices explain 8% of the reduction in aggression
(p-value: 0.09).
Maternal skills also influence child development. For girls, the decrease in maternal anxiety explains 14% of the reduction in conduct problems (p-value: 0.06). The contribution
of maternal self-esteem is negative and accounts for 29% of the treatment effect on female
warmth and empathy. This result is consistent with research that argues that improvements in self-esteem may increase selfishness (Burr and Christensen, 1992). Conversely, the
mother’s maternal mastery explains 29% of the improvement in female warmth/empathy
(p-value: 0.09).

6.3

Decomposition of Treatment Effects at Age 12

Figures 5–7 decompose statistically significant treatment effects at age 12 into treatmentinduced changes of skills at age 6. We find that changes in male cognitive abilities at
age 6 play a substantial role in explaining achievement scores at age 12. The program’s
effects on cognition for boys at age 6 explain 41% of the treatment effects on the Tennessee
Comprehensive Assessment Program (TCAP) test for language and 66% for math (p-value:
0.07).28 The improvement of cognitive skills also explains 46% of the treatment effect on
PIAT reading comprehension (p-value 0.04) and 51% of the treatment effect on PIAT math
scores (p-value 0.04) for boys. Remarkably, boosts in cognition explain 68% of the treatment
effect in the average math GPA for boys (p-value: 0.08).
Male cognitive gains also explain treatment effects on class absenteeism and internalizing
problems. Improvements in cognition account for 24% of the of the reduction in the average
number of day absences between the first and the fifth years of schooling (p-value 0.06).
Cognitive gains also explain 17% of the male treatment effect on internalizing behavior (p28

This achievement test was administered at grades 3 and above. In the control group, the mean percentile
test score for reading was 38th percentile, and for math 40.3th percentile.

32

value: 0.06) and 14% of the results on male anxiety/depression at age 12 (p-value: 0.03).
The intervention also reduced aggression at age 6, which accounts for 12% of the reduction
in the likelihood of being anxious/depressed (p-value: 0.09 see Figure 6).29 .
The program decreased the likelihood of being overweight for females. The reduction
in conduct problems fostered by the program at age 6 explains 19% of the treatment effect
on standardized female BMI (p-value: 0.06). When we decompose the treatment effects on
female risky behavior at age 12, we find that this treatment effect is largely unexplained by
our mediators (not displayed in the figures).30
The differential treatment effects on cognition and achievement by gender follow the
pattern of treatment effects found on health at birth, which are stronger for boys. Epidemiological and medical literature has argued that boys are more susceptible to prenatal
influences than girls (Kraemer, 2000; Schore, 2017), which could explain why we find effects
of the program on birth weight only for boys.

Notes: These bar graphs show the fractions of the overall treatment effect explained by changes in the mediators as well as the unexplained portion
(residual). The names of the outcomes are located on the left side of the bar graphs. Note that the fractions do not add up to 1 because some of
the mediators contribute such a small and statistically insignificant fraction that they have not been shown. Values to the left of the vertical line are
negative and values to the right of the vertical line are positive; bold values are significant at the 10% level. Values above the bars are the p-values
associated with the mediation fraction, and values inside the bars are the mediation fractions themselves. Numbers in parentheses to the right of
the bars are the total treatment effects. Negative values correspond to the mediator working in the opposite direction of the overall treatment
effect, while positive values correspond to the mediator working in the same direction as the overall treatment effect. The mediators are the home
environment, parenting attitudes, maternal anxiety, maternal self-esteem, and maternal mastery, all of which were measured when the child was 6
years old, as well as birth weight. The following controls were used: maternal race, maternal age, maternal height, gestational age, household density,
region, employment status of household head, grandmother support, randomization wave, income category, mother currently in school, and maternal
parenting attitudes.

Summary and Conclusion

This paper analyzes the impacts through age 12 of the Nurse-Family Partnership Program
as implemented in Memphis. The Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) is the most cited home
visiting program in the US (Howard and Brooks-Gunn, 2009a) and is one of the evidencebased home visiting models supported by the Maternal, Infant and Early Childhood Home
Visiting (MEICHV) program. Currently, NFP surrogates have provided services for more
than 200, 000 families in 43 states across the U.S.
We contribute to the existing literature in the NFP in several ways. We perform inference accounting for the special features of the NFP randomization protocol and addressing
selective reporting of statistically significant outcomes (i.e., “cherry picking”). We show that
most of the results of previous papers based on large sample asymptotic inference survive
small sample permutation tests. However, fewer treatment effects survive corrections for
multiple-hypothesis testing. Nonetheless, there are strong effects for boys that are sustained
until age 12.
In addition, this is the first paper that formally examines the mechanisms underlying
NFP treatment effects. Following the methodology developed by Heckman et al. (2013), we
decompose statistically significant treatment effects into interpretable components associated
with NFP-induced changes in children’s early skills and parental investments. We estimate
the channels underlying treatment effects at age 6 (using maternal skills and investments
effects at the end of the program as mediators ) and at age 12 (using the program effects at
age 6 as mediators).
We find statistically significant treatment effects of NFP on birth weight for boys as well
as improvements in the home environment, parenting attitudes, and maternal mental health
for parents of both boys and girls at age 2.31 At age 6, the program improves cognitive
skills for both boys and girls, while it enhances early socio-emotional skills for girls. These
31

Our result of treatment effects on birth weight and other health at birth outcomes for boys contrasts
with recent findings of no effects on similar outcomes in the Family Nurse Partnership program in the U.K.
(Robling et al., 2016).

treatment effects arise from program-induced improvements in maternal traits and early-life
family investments at age 2. The treatment effects for males persist through age 12, but they
do not persist for girls. Treated males outperform controls on a range of achievement scores.
We find that 40% to 60% of male treatment effects at age 12 can be explained by enhanced
cognitive skills measured at age 6. The program has much weaker long-term effects for girls.
Our results are consistent with the evidence from well-known home visiting interventions
like the Infant Health and Development Project (IHDP), and current nurse visitation programs like Preparing For Life (Ireland) (Garcı́a et al., 2017a; Doyle, 2017; Besharov et al.,
2011; Klebanov et al., 2001; Brooks-Gunn et al., 1994). Table 11 compares the results from
the present study with the evidence from these two interventions.
Home visiting programs are widely advocated policy tools for promoting early child development by serving both disadvantaged parents and children at the same time. Several
program models have existed since the 1960’s, and the Nurse-Family Partnership is one of the
most widely used and evaluated models. Overall, several home visiting programs have shown
positive effects on improving parenting practices and the home environment,32 which are in
line with our findings on those domains (Chen and Chan, 2016; Filene et al., 2013; Nievar
et al., 2010).33 However, in a meta-analytic study of home visiting programs, Chen and Chan
(2016) argue that few studies have looked at the effects of these programs on maternal mental
health. We provide some evidence that the NFP improved maternal mastery and self-esteem
and reduced maternal anxiety with effect sizes between 0.2-0.3 SD. Regarding child development outcomes, Filene et al. (2013) argue that previous home visiting interventions have
shown mixed effects on child cognitive skills and the effect sizes vary significantly among the
studies that have found effects (between 0.11-0.38 SDs). In this paper, we present evidence
that the NFP had strong effects on cognitive skills at age six with effect sizes of 0.27 SDs for
boys and 0.12 SDs for girls. These cognitive gains persist in program impacts on achievement
32

For example, Filene et al. (2013) show that average effects sizes in home visiting evaluations range
between 0.13 and 0.33 SDs.

test scores for boys at age 12. Filene et al. (2013) also demonstrate that the evidence of
home visiting programs on birth outcomes is mixed. We find that the NFP improves these
outcomes only for boys. Studies that review the evidence from home visiting programs argue
that the existence of mixed effects across interventions can be explained because programs
differ in the characteristics of the target population, goals, curriculum, services provided,
frequency, the use of nurses versus paraprofessionals, and evaluation methods (Chen and
Chan, 2016; Filene et al., 2013; Nievar et al., 2010; Paulsell et al., 2010).
This paper provides evidence that some of estimated NFP program effects for boys are
sustained after the intervention ends. The more beneficial long-term effects for boys relative
to girls is consistent with a large and growing body of evidence (Elango et al., 2014; Garcı́a
et al., 2017a,b and Garcı́a et al., 2017). We also examine the underlying channels generating
the estimated treatment effects and show that enhancements in the skills in early childhood
and better parenting can explain a sizeable portion of NFP effects found in late childhood.
