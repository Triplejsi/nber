The Effects of U.S. Monetary Policy on Emerging Market Economies' Sovereign and Corporate
Bond Markets
John D. Burger, Francis E. Warnock, and Veronica Cacdac Warnock
NBER Working Paper No. 23628
July 2017
JEL No. F21,F3,G15
ABSTRACT
We analyze the effect of the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy on EME sovereign and
corporate bond markets by focusing on two dimensions: the evolution of the structure (size and
currency composition) of the bond markets and their allocations within the bond portfolios of US
investors. Global factors, particularly the level of long-term US Treasury yields, matter. Across
all specifications, when US long-term interest rates were low (i) EMEs issued more sovereign and
private-sector local currency bonds and more private-sector foreign currency bonds and (ii) US
investment in EME sovereign bonds (both local currency and USD-denominated) increased. In
contrast, after controlling for the level of US long-term interest rates, measures that attempt to
isolate the effects of US unconventional monetary policy are often statistically insignificant in our
analysis. Local factors matter too: The local currency government bond markets in countries with
stronger regulatory quality/creditor rights are larger and attract relatively more US investment.
Finally, consistent with Burger et al. (2017), we find that the well-known home bias phenomenon
is at least in part a home currency bias: US investors exhibit no home bias against some
countries’ USD-denominated bonds, whereas for local currency bonds the familiar home bias is
very present.

The global environment for emerging market economy (EME) bond markets has changed
dramatically over the past few decades. Local currency bond markets (LCBMs) have developed,
especially in EMEs with low inflation, stronger institutions and well defined creditor rights (see Burger
and Warnock 2003, 2006; Eichengreen and Luengnaruemitchai 2006, Claessens, Klingebiel and
Schmukler, 2007). Some EMEs have been able to borrow globally in their local currency, which enhances
financial stability by ameliorating the currency mismatches that were at the core of past crises (Goldstein
and Turner, 2004). However, large inflows of foreign investment can be problematic, as most extreme
capital flow episodes are driven by debt flows (Forbes and Warnock, 2013), credit booms lead to crises
(Mendoza and Terrones, 2008; Gourinchas and Obstfeld, 2012; Schularick and Taylor, 2012) and large
foreign investment flows into LCBMs can complicate the tasks of EME policymakers by appreciating real
exchange rates, fanning asset price bubbles and intensifying lending booms. Indeed, unconventional
monetary policy (UMP) by many advanced economies (AEs) may have propelled a global search-foryield strategy and contributed to a period of large and volatile inflows to EMEs. Many EME policymakers
who were worried about excessive upward pressure on local currencies and indiscriminate flows enabling
increasingly risky borrowing are now concerned about the possibility of an external shock (such as US
monetary policy tightening) prompting a stampede for the exits.
This paper is the latest in a series of ours on EME bond markets. Our early work was primarily
concerned with whether EME bond markets could ever develop and whether foreign investors would hold
EME local currency bonds as opposed to only holding EMEs’ foreign currency denominated bonds.
Burger and Warnock (2006, 2007) found that, counter to the “original sin” literature, policies and laws
indeed matter, as EMEs with stable inflation rates and strong creditor rights have more developed local
bond markets, rely less on foreign currency-denominated bonds and can attract US investors. Our
subsequent work focused in part on whether the global financial crisis put an end to EMEs’ bond market

1

development and foreigners’ interest in EME local currency bonds. Burger, Warnock and Warnock
(2012), focusing on the period from 2001 to the end of 2008—when the crisis had already begun—find
that policies and laws that helped improve macroeconomic stability and creditor rights enabled EME local
currency bond markets to grow substantially and also provided US investors with attractive returns. US
investors responded by sharply increasing their holdings of EME local currency bonds, especially in EMEs
with investor-friendly institutions and policies. Burger, Sengupta, Warnock and Warnock (2015) extend
that analysis in a panel dataset from 2006 through 2011, focusing on US investors’ reallocations within
their international bond portfolios. They note that the steady increase in US investors’ allocations towards
EME local currency bonds, which was unabated by the global financial crisis and even accelerated after
the crisis, was due in part to global ‘push’ factors, such as low US long-term interest rates and subdued
risk aversion or expected volatility. But also evident was investor differentiation among EMEs, with the
largest reallocations going to those EMEs with strong macroeconomic fundamentals, such as less volatile
inflation and more positive current account balances. Finally, Burger, Warnock and Warnock (2017),
using a panel dataset from 2006 to 2015, find a home currency bias: Not only do factors associated with
greater (or less) cross-border investment in bonds differ by currency denomination, but also the everpresent home bias actually disappears in some cases when bonds are denominated in the investor’s
currency.
In this paper, we analyze bond markets using a panel dataset similar to that in Burger, Warnock
and Warnock (2017), spanning the period 2007 to 2015. Currency denomination, as in all of our bond
market papers, is an important aspect of our analysis, but unlike in our earlier work, the focus here is
squarely on sectoral aspects of EME bond markets. In particular, we assess the development of EME
sovereign and corporate bond markets, both local currency and foreign currency and attempt to understand
what drives US investors’ portfolios in those markets.

2

We find that the structure of EME bond markets has generally continued to improve over the 2007
to 2015 period, as many EMEs have lessened their reliance on foreign currency bonds. That trend has
reversed slightly in recent years, in particular because of increased private-sector issuance of foreign
currency denominated bonds. Nevertheless, the share of EME bonds denominated in the local currency is
markedly higher than a decade ago and time-fixed effects in our regressions indicate that, after controlling
for local variables, over the 2007-2015 period there has been a trend toward larger sovereign local
currency bond markets and larger private foreign currency bond markets. It is this latter trend that creates
the recent decline in the share of private bonds denominated in local currency.1 Regarding the determinants
of bond market development, we find that local factors matter: countries with better macroeconomic
stability (i.e., lower inflation volatility) have larger sovereign local currency bond markets and a greater
share of private local currency denominated bonds; stronger regulatory quality/creditor rights are
associated with larger sovereign local currency bond markets and a greater share of local currency
denominated bonds (both sovereign and private issued); and countries with more positive current account
balances have larger bond markets (both local currency and foreign currency denominated, and especially
private-sector issued bonds) and a greater share of bonds denominated in local currency. Interestingly,
larger economies in our sample have smaller foreign currency bond markets and a larger share of local
currency bonds. US conditions and policies also influence EME bond markets: (a) local currency (both
sovereign and private) and private foreign currency bond markets increased in size when US yields,
especially the non-large scale asset purchase portion (non-LSAP), were lower, and (b) EME bond markets
grew most during periods of lower CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). Controlling for the level of US longterm interest rates, we fail to find robust evidence for an additional impact of UMP on EME bond market

1

For this study, a local currency bond is denominated in the currency of the country of residence of the issuer, in keeping
with residence-based international accounts. A recent focus on the ultimate nationality of the issuer —for example, when a
Chinese firm issues a yuan-denominated bond through an off-shore subsidiary (see, for example, McCauley et al., 2013)— is
relevant, but beyond the scope of our study.

development, as across three UMP proxies there is limited and mixed evidence linking US unconventional
monetary policy and bond market development.
We also examine the evolution of US investors’ EME bond portfolios, employing data on
country-level holdings (by currency and sector of issuer) built from high-quality security-level data. While
holdings of private-sector local currency bonds remain quite small (the data appear to indicate that EME
corporates must issue in US dollars to attract a meaningful amount of US investment), holdings of
sovereign issued local currency bonds and private-issued USD-denominated bonds have increased
significantly over the past decade. For sovereign local currency bonds, we find that US investment is
greater in EMEs with more positive fiscal balances, higher yields, greater regulatory quality and creditor
rights and stronger trade ties with the US. Some global factors also matter. For example, lower US longterm interest rates and a lower VIX are associated with increased investment in EME sovereign local
currency bonds. However, results for UMP proxies were mixed, including some (but not much) evidence
that the LSAP-induced fall in US rates was associated with increased investment in EME sovereign local
currency bonds. Overall results for these bonds are consistent with the classic result of low US rates being
associated with a surge in investment in EMEs. From our analyses of US cross-border investment in USDdenominated bonds, we find investment was greater in EMEs with stronger regulatory quality and creditor
rights, lower inflation volatility and lower yields. We also find evidence that lower US interest rates are
associated with increased investment in USD-denominated sovereign bonds, but global push factors do
not appear important in determining investment in EME private-sector bonds.
In addition to being related to our series of papers on EME bond markets, as discussed above, this
paper is related to academic literature in four respects. First, on bond market development, it adds to
Burger and Warnock (2006), Claessens et al. (2007) and many others (to be discussed in Section 3).
Second, it contributes to the literature on relationships between international portfolios and global and

4

local factors. For example, Calvo et al. (1993) noted the importance of global factors such as US interest
rates in explaining capital inflows, and Chuhan et al. (1998) made the important contribution of separating
different types of flows and found that global factors were important in explaining capital inflows, but
country-specific developments were at least as important. Many subsequent papers confirmed points made
by those two papers. A recent example, Fratzscher (2012), using weekly fund flows data, found that global
factors were the main drivers of capital flows in the midst of the recent crisis, but that country-specific
determinants were dominant in the years immediately following the crisis. Third, our paper is also directly
related to work on international investment in bonds—including Lane (2006) and Fidora et al. (2007)—
and on US investors’ local currency bond portfolios—Burger and Warnock (2007); Burger, Warnock and
Warnock (2012). Fourth, a closely related but separate literature looks at cross-border banking flows—
see, for example, Blank and Buch (2007) and Hale and Obstfeld (2016).
Our assessment of EME bond markets—their size, structure and international investment—starts
in the next section with a discussion of considerations about existing data on bonds outstanding and bond
holdings. Section 2 describes the three ways UMP proxies enter our regression analysis. In Section 3, we
describe and assess the evolution of EME markets. In Section 4, we assess US investors’ EME bond
portfolios. Section 5 concludes.

1. Bonds Outstanding and Bond Holdings Data
1.1 Working Dataset
Our assessment of the development of EME bond markets demands a careful appraisal of available
datasets. We consider the following four points: First, the currency denomination of bonds should be
identified for both bonds outstanding and cross-border bond holdings—the location of the issuer is not an
accurate proxy for the currency denomination of bonds—so that we can examine the development of local
currency denominated bonds against foreign currency denominated ones, as well as investors’ allocations
5

within the two (local and foreign currency). Second, we are interested in revealing any differences in
trends between sovereign issued bonds and private-sector issued bonds, and so we require data
disaggregated by sector (public v. private). Third, we choose a class of investors, namely, those residing
in the US, for which consistent and complete data are available. Fourth, we obviously need data through
time.
Given the above requirements, our working dataset for this paper consists of annual data from
2007 to 2015 on 15 EMEs, assembled from two main sources: portfolio data from US Treasury
comprehensive benchmark surveys and bond market data from the recently redesigned debt securities
datasets of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Local currency denominated debt is clearly
identified in the Treasury data and, in the BIS data, it is the sum of the long-term debt component of
“domestic debt” and the local currency/local issuer portion of “international bonds”. Overall, our dataset
allows us to separately analyze bonds by sector of the issuer (sovereign or private) and by currency
denomination (local currency and foreign currency, including a separate entry for USD-denominated
bonds). We consider this dataset appropriate for our study; but, it also poses significant challenges, which
we outline below.

1.2 The Amount of Bonds Outstanding
Before 2012, data that identified the currency denomination and issuer of bonds were available
from BIS for more than 40 countries, including over 20 EMEs. The relevant data on debt securities and
international bonds statistics formed the BIS Quarterly Review “Table 16A: Domestic debt securities, by
sector and residence of issuer” and “Table 14B: International bonds and notes - all issuers, by residence
of issuer”. Domestic debt was defined by the BIS as local currency bonds issued by locals in the local
market (i.e., not placed directly abroad), while international bonds were bonds issued either in a different

6

currency or in a different market. It was possible to back out data on bonds (debt securities with original
maturity over one year)2 placed either domestically or internationally, as well as to identify the issuer’s
residence, the currency denomination of the bonds and the type of issuer (sovereign or private). Burger,
Sengupta, Warnock and Warnock (2015), using this BIS dataset, were able to include 21 EMEs and 23
AEs. However, this dataset was discontinued and is thus available only through 2011, and is possibly
inconsistent with the new dataset based on new methodology that the BIS established in 2012 (see Gruić
and Wooldridge, 2012).
In the new BIS dataset (with 2012 definitions) that we use in this paper, “international bonds” are
largely the same as in the discontinued pre-2012 dataset described above. The challenge with this new
dataset is that central banks of some countries have opted to report data that sum together domestic and
international debt. We argue that, even for an aggregated analysis, combining domestic and international
debt hampers analysis. For analyses that explicitly require splits on currency and maturity—a split that
used to be readily available because the international portion was built up from security-level data and the
domestic portion was assumed (by definition) to be denominated in the local currency—aggregated debt
data presents a severe limitation.

1.3 Bond Holdings
International bond portfolio data must identify the currency denomination of the underlying bonds,
because the location of the issuer does not indicate the currency denomination of the bonds. One dataset
that identifies currency denomination is available for a particular set of investors: US resident investors.

2

The split between bonds/notes and short-term paper can be important. Consider, for example, Brazil. A large proportion of
Brazilian debt securities are short-term; see Leal and Carvalhal da Silva (2008) for a detailed analysis. In the old BIS
database, Brazilian debt securities were broken out by maturity (and currency denomination), and it showed that, as of end2011, about $1 trillion of its $1.5 trillion in domestic debt securities were short-term instruments (e.g., money market). Using
the old dataset, one can omit Brazilian short-term instruments and focus on Brazilian domestic long-term debt securities
(which totaled $0.5 trillion at end-2011).

7

Data on US holdings of foreign bonds have been obtained from periodic, comprehensive security-level
benchmark surveys conducted by the US Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The security-level holdings data are not
available to researchers outside the Federal Reserve Board, but the country-level aggregates (with
currency and sector breakdown) that are built from the security-level data are available for over 100
countries and provide a clean annual dataset beginning in 2007.3 These holdings data also constitute the
official US data on international positions; for example, the figure for international bonds in the
International Investment Position report issued by the Bureau of Economic Analysis is formed by
aggregating the survey’s security-level information.
The data based on the granular security-by-security data are aggregated according to the currency
denomination of a bond, the country residence of its issuer and the sector (sovereign or private) of the
issuer. Starting with year-end 2007 data, the data are posted on the Treasury website, in a report with a
table labeled as “US holdings of foreign long-term debt securities, by country and sector of issuer,
denominated in US dollars and in local currency.”4
Although in our analysis we are forced, by limited data availability, to focus on US investors’
cross-border bond holdings (and not investors across a number of countries), it is sufficiently rich because
US investors are a large group for which we have high-quality, publicly available data. And to reiterate,
US investors’ bond holdings are captured at the security level, so the exact nature of the bond is known to

Note that, while for foreign currency bonds we limit our portfolio analysis to USD-denominated bonds, U.S. investors’
holdings of third-currency bonds (i.e., neither in USD, nor in the issuer’s currency) are extremely small, amounting to only
2.3% of their foreign bond portfolio in 2011.
4
For more detail, see, for example, U.S. Department of the Treasury et al. (2008), or the Griever, Lee and Warnock (2001)
primer. For the exact table we use, see, for example, Table 29 from U.S. Department of the Treasury et al. (2008) or Table
A11 from U.S. Department of the Treasury et al. (2016). Note that we alter the underlying Treasury data in two ways. One,
we leave true zeros as zeros, but we replace asterisks, which indicate that U.S. holdings are greater than zero but less than
$500,000, with $250,000. Two, there are instances when, for a particular split of the data, reported U.S. holdings are greater
than the amount outstanding; in these cases, we set holdings equal to the amount outstanding.

the data clearinghouse (i.e., Treasury, NY Fed and the Federal Reserve Board) and, therefore, this enables
the production of publicly available reports on bonds by various classifications (currency, sector, etc.)

2. Unconventional Monetary Policy in the Empirical Model
Several proxies for unconventional monetary policy (UMP) are available, although for our
purposes no one method seems to be superior over the rest.5 We therefore use three approaches for UMP.
First, following Ahmed and Zlate (2014), we decompose the 10-year Treasury yield into two
components: one that may be due to LSAPs (usi10_LSAP) and the yield estimated in the absence of LSAPs
(usi10_nonLSAP). Specifically, in a first-stage regression, we regress Treasury yields on one-quarter
ahead Fed net asset purchases (since the QE programs were announced ahead of implementation) over the
period from 2002:Q4 to 2016:Q2, and then we compute the LSAP component of yields as beta*LSAP.6
The remaining yield is the non-LSAP component. For the period prior to the first QE program, we set the
LSAP component to zero. The results suggest that, on average, $100 billion in LSAPs in a quarter would
decrease yields by 37.5 basis points (bps), in line with the Ahmed and Zlate (2014) estimate of 31 bps and
roughly consistent with other estimates in the literature. For example, the D’Amico and King (2013) event
study estimated a persistent downward shift in yields averaging 30 bps, and the VAR estimates of
Bhattarai, Chatterjee and Park (2015) suggest $100 billion in LSAPs would have a 25 basis point effect

5

In the literature, a number of UMP proxies have been employed; see Ahmed and Zlate (2014) for a discussion focused on
LSAPs. For example, an indicator variable has been used to mark initial announcements and implementation periods of the
first three rounds of LSAPs; see Gagnon et al. (2010), Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011) and Bauer (2012). See
also D’Amico and King (2013), Wright (2012), Hamilton and Wu (2012), Bauer and Rudebusch (2014), Rogers et al. (2014)
and the Fawley and Neely (2013) narrative account of the LSAPs of four major central banks. Another technique is to use a
VAR-based approach to assess the effects of quantitative easing (QE); see Wright (2012), Baumeister and Benati (2013),
Gambacorta et al. (2014) and Bhattarai, Chatterjee and Park (2015). Swanson (2016) uses techniques from Gurkaynak, Sack
and Swanson (2005) to estimate separate forward guidance and LSAP effects. Other work on the international effects of U.S.
QE policy include Glick and Leduc (2012, 2013), Chen et al. (2012) and Bauer and Neely (2014); Eichengreen and Gupta
(2015), Aizenman et al. (2016) and Bowman et al. (2015); Tillmann (2014) estimates of the QE effects on the aggregate data
of EMEs; and the Ahmed and Zlate (2014), Ahmed et al. (2016), Dahlhaus and Vasishtha (2014) and Lim et al. (2014)
analyses of the QE effects on capital flows to EMEs.

LSAP is the change in the size of Federal Reserve securities holdings (from the Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.4.1)
scaled by GDP.

on impact. Figure 1 shows the actual 10-year Treasury yield (thick line), our estimate of what the 10-year
yield would have been without LSAPs (thin line) and LSAP scaled by GDP (bars, right-hand scale). Table
1 shows the two series from the decomposition that enter our annual regressions: an estimate of what the
US 10-year yield would have been without LSAPs (usi10_nonLSAP) and the effect of LSAPs on the US
10-year yield (usi10_LSAP). The LSAP effect averages 31 bps per year from 2009 through 2014 with
peaks in 2010 and 2013.
The second approach augments the first by adding a direct measure of the amount of LSAPs scaled
by GDP (lsap_flow_gdp) in regressions that also include the 10-year interest rate.
The third approach uses well-identified UMP shocks to the 10-year interest rate, as calculated by
Rogers, Scotti and Wright (2016), henceforth RSW, which updates Rogers et al. (2014). Specifically,
RSW use high-frequency financial market data around Federal Reserve announcements (FOMC
statements as well as governors’ speeches) to help identify monetary policy shocks in a VAR setting. We
use the RSW shock to the 10-year rate—the change in 10-year Treasury rates within a 2-hour window of
announcements—and, at the same time, also include the level of the 10-year Treasury interest rate (which
itself captures some of the impact of unconventional monetary policy).
We are agnostic on the many ways to proxy UMP; we therefore utilize the three approaches
described above and attempt to discern effects that are robust to the choice of a proxy.

3. Bond Markets in Emerging Market Economies
3.1 Structure of EME Sovereign and Corporate Bond Markets
We start by presenting salient features of EME sovereign and corporate bond markets, specifically,
their size and structure. For consistency, in descriptive tables or figures that present aggregates, we include

10

only the 13 EMEs for which we have complete data for 2009 and 2015: Chile, Colombia, Mexico and
Peru; Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines and Thailand; and Israel, Russia, South Africa and Turkey.
Table 2 presents information on 13 EME bond markets and shows that, over the period 2009-2015,
local currency bond markets grew from $2289 billion to $3281 billion, just over half of which were issued
by sovereign entities. The size of local currency bonds, measured as a percent of the country’s GDP,
increased modestly from 42% to 46%, and their weight in the global bond market increased from 2.7% to
3.5%. Foreign currency denominated bonds—most of which are issued by the private sector—also
increased, from $436 billion in 2009 to $851 billion in 2015, increasing from 8.0% to 11.8% of national
GDP and nearly doubling their weight in the global bond market (from 0.5% to 0.9%). Of the foreign
currency denominated bonds, most are USD-denominated ($714 billion out of $851 billion in 2015).
Overall, most EME bonds are denominated in the local currency; in 2015, 87% of sovereign bonds and
72% of private-sector bonds were denominated in the local currency.
The evolution of EME sovereign and corporate bonds markets is plotted in Figures 2a-2e. We see
the stark predominance of local currency bonds over USD-denominated bonds and a milder predominance
of sovereign over private bonds (Figure 2a). Though smaller in size, USD-denominated private-sector
bonds have rapidly grown, more than doubling between 2009 and 2015. Bonds outstanding by country,
plotted in Figures 2b-2e, help uncover any regional trends, while showing differences across countries
within a region. As a share of GDP (Figure 2b), local currency sovereign bond markets increased smartly
since 2007 in many Asian and Latin American EMEs, but less so in other countries. In contrast, trends in
the development of many private-sector local currency bond markets are less discernible (Figure 2c).
Further, local currency share—the share of local currency bonds in all bonds—is generally high for
sovereign bonds (Figure 2d), but lower and even declining for private-sector bonds (Figure 2e). This last

11

point—the decline in local currency share of private bonds—is due to the doubling of private-sector
foreign currency bonds evident in Figure 2a.

3.2 The Determinants of the Size and Structure of EME Bond Markets
Why do some EMEs have larger local currency bond markets than others? In Burger, Warnock
and Warnock (2012), we assessed the size of local currency bond markets in 2008 and found that EMEs
with lower inflation volatility and stronger legal rights have more developed local bond markets. In Burger
and Warnock (2006), the findings were similar; economies can (and have) put in place institutions and
policies that foster the development of debt markets. Economies with better inflation performance (an
outcome of creditor-friendly policies) have more developed local bond markets, both private and
sovereign and rely less on foreign currency denominated bonds. Creditor-friendly laws matter. Stronger
rule of law is associated with deeper local bond markets and countries with stronger creditor rights are
able to issue a larger share of bonds in their local currencies.
With an annual panel dataset spanning 2007 to 2015, we refresh our analysis on the size and
currency composition of bond markets. Similar to Burger and Warnock (2006) and Claessens et al. (2007),
we employ three measures of bond market development, each defined by sector (sovereign and private)
as follows: the ratio of the size of the local currency bond markets to GDP, the ratio of the size of the
foreign currency bond markets to GDP and the share of the country’s outstanding bonds denominated in
the local currency (local currency share).
Explanatory variables include regulatory quality, creditor rights, fiscal and current account
balances, country size, GDP growth rate, the extent of trade with the US, a bond-specific measure of
capital account openness and inflation volatility. Specifically:

12



regcr is a measure of regulatory quality and creditor rights, calculated as a weighted average of
the Regulatory Quality Index from the World Bank’s World Governance Indicators and the Legal
Rights Index from the ‘Getting Credit’ section of the World Bank’s Doing Business report. We
construct a composite measure with twice the weight on regulatory quality, according to the
GEMLOC Investability Indicator Methodology (Markit 2013).7 We recast the indicators to have
values from 0 to 1—instead of from 0 to 100—to easily interpret the regression coefficients.



caopen is a Markit (2013) de jure measure of the openness of a country’s local currency bond
market to foreign investment, with higher scores indicating that a bond market is more open to
cross-border investment. From the update of Markit (2013), we use the November observation of
“Capital Control, Convertibility and Access” for each country and year and merge with the Burger
et al. (2015) estimates for 2006 and 2007. We assume top scores (i.e., completely open) for South
Korea (which enters the Markit dataset in 2011 with score of 100) and Israel and Singapore (which
are not in the Markit sample). We recast caopen to range from 0 to 1.



ca_gdp and fbal (current account balance and fiscal balance, both scaled by GDP) are from IMF’s
IFS as reported in Haver Analytics.



infvol, inflation volatility, is computed on a rolling basis using three years of quarterly data (from
the IMF’s International Financial Statistics (IFS) data as reported in Haver Analytics).



growth is calculated as the three-year average growth rate in real GDP per capita (from IMF’s IFS
data as reported in Haver Analytics).



nomgdp is the log of nominal GDP in USD.

The regulatory quality index measures a government’s ability to formulate and implement sound policies and regulations
that promote private sector development, while the creditor rights index measures the degree to which collateral and

trade_gdp is bilateral imports and exports between the US and the foreign country, scaled by the
respective countries’ nominal GDP (source: IMF).



For global variables, we include the VIX, as well as several proxies for unconventional monetary
policy and US 10-year Treasury yields (as described in Section 2 and presented in Table 1).
In our regressions, we use an annual panel dataset that spans the period 2007 to 2015 and includes

15 EMEs. In all, we have 123 observations, as due to data limitations some EMEs enter the panel later
than 2007.8 We report our results in Table 3 for sovereign bonds and for private-sector bonds using three
measures: local currency scaled by GDP, foreign currency scaled by GDP and share of local currency in
total. Constants are included but not reported. Estimates are calculated using panel-feasible generalized
least squares (FGLS), which allows for heteroscedastic error structures and different autocorrelation
coefficients for each country. Wald tests (not reported) show that the explanatory variables are always
jointly significant.
First, in Table 3a we include time-fixed effects (but not global factors) to capture the impact of
global forces on EME bond markets during each year in the sample; coefficients for 2008 to 2015 are
reported and should be interpreted relative to 2007. The strongest results (in a statistical sense and also
robust across specifications) are as follows:


Countries with stronger regulatory/creditor rights have larger local currency sovereign bond
markets and a greater share of bonds denominated in local currency (both sovereign and private).



Countries with stronger current account balances have larger local currency bond markets (and
higher local currency share).

8

Ten countries have data for all 9 years. In addition, Chile enters in 2008; Mexico and Pakistan, in 2009; Hungary, in 2010;
and India, in 2011. We lose 3 observations in the final column of Table 3, because Pakistan had no reported private-sector
bonds.

14



Trade with the US matters for private-sector bonds, but negatively impacts sovereign bonds. While
we cannot see the underlying firm-level data, it could be that corporates that trade a lot with the
US also issue more bonds (some of which are USD-denominated).



Capital account openness matters only for foreign currency private bonds. Macroeconomic
stability (infvol) impacts only local currency sovereign bonds.



The impact of country size varies across the specifications: Larger countries in our sample have
smaller foreign currency bond markets and a larger share of local currency bonds.



The time effects are often positive and significant for sovereign local currency bonds and foreign
currency private bonds and often negative for the local currency share of private bonds. In other
words, after controlling for other variables, over the 2007 to 2015 period there has been a trend
toward larger sovereign local currency bond markets and larger private foreign currency bond
markets (the latter trend leading to a decline in the share of all private bonds denominated in local
currency).
In Tables 3b-3d, we include global push variables and omit the time-fixed effects. The impact of

country-specific macroeconomic conditions and policies is broadly similar to the analysis in Table 3a. In
addition, we see that US yields and global risk conditions matter. EME local currency (both sovereign and
private) and foreign currency private bond markets increased in size when the non-LSAP component of
the 10-year Treasury was lower (Table 3b). We also find evidence that EME bond markets grew most
during periods of lower VIX. Further, there is no robust evidence showing an independent impact of
UMP—that is, above and beyond what is embedded in long-term Treasury yields—on the size and
currency composition of EME bond markets. Across the three UMP proxies, there is limited and
inconsistent evidence linking Fed policy and bond market development (beyond the ever-present US long-

15

term interest rate effect). That said, we do find some evidence suggesting that UMPs that lower US long
rates are associated with increased EMEs’ private-sector issuance in US dollars.

4. US Investors’ International Bond Portfolios
4.1 Analyzing US Investors’ Portfolios: Measure
The dependent variable in this analysis is the Ahmed, Curcuru, Warnock and Zlate (2016) measure
of portfolio weights—the normalized relative weight.9 Relative weight is simply a country’s weight in US
investors’ portfolio relative to its weight in a benchmark portfolio. Specifically, country i’s relative
portfolio weight in US portfolios is the ratio of its weight in US investors’ portfolio to its weight in the
global market. Relative weight can be defined as:

H US

Re lWgt iUS

i

 i ,US 
i .m MCapi

H
 MCap
US
i

i

(1)
i

i

where H iUS is defined as US investors’ holdings of country i’s bonds and

H

US
i

represents the global

i

portfolio of bonds held by US investors, while MCapi is the market capitalization of country i’s bond
market and

 MCap

i

is the market capitalization of the global bond market. If the portfolio weight

i

assigned to a particular bond market equals its weight in the global bond market, the relative weight for
that market is one. In reality, US investors’ relative portfolio weights are often far less than one—this is

9

Relative weight is consistent with an international Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)-based model of international
portfolio allocation as presented in Cooper and Kaplanis (1986). That model, described in some detail in Holland et al.
(2016), includes country-specific proportional investment costs representing both explicit and implicit costs of investing
abroad and is designed to optimize an investor’s allocation of wealth among risky securities in n countries in order to
maximize expected returns net of costs. If there are no costs to investing, the allocation collapses to the global market
capitalization allocation; that is, the investor allocates his wealth across countries according to market capitalizations. If costs
are non-zero and non-uniform, allocations deviate from market weights. The higher the costs in a particular foreign market,
the more severely underweighted that country will be in the investor’s portfolios. The international CAPM, therefore,
provides a theoretical underpinning for our focus on relative weight.

16

one dimension of the well-known home bias in asset holdings—because over 90 percent of US investors’
bond holdings are issued by US entities. That said, for some asset classes—such as bonds denominated in
the investor’s currency—relative weights can and sometimes do exceed one (Burger, Warnock and
Warnock 2017).
Relative price changes will cause movements in Relative Weight even if investors do not alter
their positions. This relative price effect can be removed through the simple normalization of dividing the
relative weight from equation (1) by the relative weight for the home market:
norm Re lWgt 

i ,US
i ,m

US ,US
US ,m

(2)

This normalized relative weight is shown in Ahmed et al. (2016) to isolate portfolio reallocations
that are independent of relative price changes and are consistent with the Bekaert and Wang (2009)
adjustment of scaling by the source country’s home bias. In our panel regressions, we use normalized
relative weight, a measure of portfolio allocations that omits passive portfolio changes due to relative price
changes.

4.2 Evolution of EME Bond Holdings
The EME local currency bond portfolio of US investors grew dramatically from $20 billion in
2009 to $72 billion in 2015 (lower panel of Table 4). EME local currency bonds were 2.7% of the global
bond market in 2009 and grew to 3.5% in 2015. US holdings increased even faster: US investors held
0.87% of outstanding EME local currency bonds in 2009 and this increased to 2.2% by 2015. Because the
weight of EME local currency bonds in US portfolios has increased relative to their weight in the global
bond market, the relative weight measure for EME local currency bonds in US investors’ portfolios more
than doubled over this period, from 0.029 in 2009 to 0.070 in 2015.

17

Holdings of USD-denominated bonds issued by EMEs are substantially larger at $73 billion in
2009, which increased to $152 billion by 2015 and US investors hold a slightly higher percentage of
outstanding EME USD-denominated bonds (20.5% in 2009, 21.3% in 2015). Indeed, the weights of EME
USD-denominated bonds in US bond portfolios (0.29% in 2009, 0.51% in 2015) are not too dissimilar
from their weight in the global bond market (0.4% in 2009, 0.8% in 2015), so US investors’ relative weight
on EME USD-denominated bonds are much closer to one (0.68 in 2009, 0.67 in 2015).
US holdings of EME bonds, levels by currency and sector, are presented in Figure 3, which can
be compared with the amount of bonds outstanding from Figure 2a. Quite apparent is the fact that the ratio
of local-to-USD bonds is much smaller in US portfolios than in bonds outstanding. Most EME bonds are
denominated in the local currency, but most US holdings (especially of private-sector bonds) are in USD.
In fact, whereas US investors hold roughly equal amounts of local currency and USD-denominated
sovereign bonds, US holdings of private-sector EME local currency bonds are so low, that it appears that
EME corporates must issue in USD to reach US investors.
Regional aggregates (Figure 4) add insight into the stylized fact presented in Burger, Warnock and
Warnock (2017) that home bias is, to some extent, a home currency bias. In each graph in Figure 4, there
are two thick lines; the higher of the two is the relative weight for USD-denominated bonds, whereas the
lower thick line is for local currency bonds. As in Burger et al. (2017), relative weights for USDdenominated bonds are always much greater than for local currency bonds. Also shown are the sectoral
splits. That EME corporates must issue in USD to reach US investors is evident from the private-sector
USD relative weights being near zero. Relative weights for sovereign local currency bonds are also quite
low, but nowhere near zero. And relative weight for USD bonds, whether sovereign or corporate, is quite
high.

18

4.3. Empirical Analysis of US Investors’ Foreign Bond Portfolios
Over the past decade, US investors have significantly increased their cross-border holdings of
EME bonds. We use a common framework to analyze the evolution in US investors’ country-specific
relative portfolio weights—that is, their portfolio weights relative to a global benchmark—for bonds split
by currency and sector. Our annual panel dataset of US investor relative portfolio weights includes 15
destination countries over the 2007 to 2015 period.10 For explanatory variables, in addition to the countryspecific factors from Table 3, we include another “pull” factor, yield, to proxy for expected return.11 The
other macroeconomic indicators are shown in Table 3 and here represent factors that likely impact the
attractiveness of an economy as a destination for cross-border bond investment. Inflation volatility
(calculated as a rolling, trailing 12-quarter standard deviation) is included as a proxy for the uncertainty
of ex-ante real returns—increased inflation volatility will also lead to more volatile nominal bond yields,
thus increasing reinvestment risk. We include the current account to GDP ratio as a proxy for financial
imbalances. A country running a current account deficit must attract capital flows; if those inflows do not
materialize, adverse financial market outcomes (such as currency depreciation and/or a spike in bond
rates) are likely to occur. We also include the 3-year average growth rate in real GDP per capita as an
indicator of the vigor of the destination economy. Our primary institutional variable (our measure of
regulatory quality and creditor rights) and our de jure measure of the openness of a country’s local
currency bond market to foreign investment are described in Section 3. For global “push” factors, we
include the VIX volatility index (which measures variation in expected volatility and risk appetite, and
which we divide by 100 for readability of regression coefficients) and the three measures of US long rates
and US unconventional monetary policy discussed in Section 2.

10

The number of destination countries is limited not by the holdings data, but by data on the size and composition of bond
markets and by explanatory variables.
11
Yield, expressed in basis points, is the annual average of monthly bond yields (yield-to-maturity from the J.P Morgan GBI
indexes). JPMorgan provided yield data through 2013; we gathered 2014 and 2015 data from the Bloomberg.

19

We present results for US cross-border investment in local currency bonds in Table 5 and in
USD-denominated bonds in Table 6. In each case, we split by sector with sovereign bonds in Panel a and
private-sector bonds in Panel b. In both tables, we include either time-fixed effects (column 4) to show
the impact of global forces on bond allocations over time without having to specify the precise nature of
the global variables, or specific global “push” factors (columns 1-3). For the time effects, coefficients for
2008 to 2015 are reported and should be interpreted relative to 2007.
4.3.1 Panel Results for Local Currency Portfolio Allocations
The results for investment in local currency bonds (Table 5) show a stark contrast between
sovereign and private-sector bonds. Much fewer explanatory variables are significant for private-sector
bonds (Panel b), but this is not surprising given the minimal investment by US investors in local currency
bonds issued by the private sector in EMEs. For sovereign bonds (Panel a), US investment is greater in
countries with more positive fiscal balances, higher yields, greater regulatory quality and creditor rights
and stronger trade linkages with the US. The time-fixed effects indicate that, after controlling for countryspecific factors, US investors increased their allocations to EME local currency sovereign bonds during
the 2010 to 2015 period. When including specific global factors (columns 1-3), results suggest that lower
US interest rates and lower VIX are associated with increased investment in local currency sovereign
bonds. We get mixed results when we bring in unconventional monetary policy, but we do find that the
LSAP-induced fall in US rates was associated with increased investment in EME local currency sovereign
bonds.
In summary, the results for EME sovereign local currency bonds in Table 5 are consistent with the
classic result of low US rates being associated with a surge in EME investment, therefore providing a
plausible channel through which US conditions could have contributed to the appreciation of EME
currencies (and also providing support to currency war claims).

20

4.3.2 Panel Results on USD-denominated Portfolio Allocations
We analyze US cross-border investment in USD-denominated bonds and report our results in
Table 6 for sovereign bonds (Panel a) and private-sector bonds (Panel b), including country-level “pull”
factors and either time-fixed effects (column 4) or global “push” factors (columns 1-3). The time-fixed
effects for USD-denominated sovereign bonds are positive and significant for many years between 2009
and 2014. For private-sector USD-denominated bonds the time-fixed effects are all negative and usually
statistically insignificant. Investment in USD-denominated sovereign EME bonds was greater in countries
with stronger regulatory quality/creditor rights, lower inflation volatility and lower yields. For USDdenominated bonds issued by the private sector in EMEs, investment is greater in smaller economies and
in those with greater trade linkages with the US For global factors, there is a sharp contrast in the impact
on US investment in USD-denominated sovereign v. private-sector bonds. Low US interest rates and
lower VIX are associated with increased relative weights on USD-denominated sovereign bonds, but we
fail to find a significant impact of these global push factors on relative weights for the growing stock of
USD-denominated private-sector bonds.

5. Conclusion
Our assessment of EME sovereign and corporate bond markets suggests that local factors matter.
For example, countries with stronger regulatory quality/creditor rights have larger sovereign issued local
currency bond markets and also attracted relatively more US investment into their sovereign bonds. But a
longstanding global factor—the level of US long-term interest rates—is also important in much of our
analysis: We find strong evidence that, when US long rates were low, (1) EMEs issued more sovereign
and private-sector local currency bonds and more private-sector foreign currency bonds, and (2) US
investment in EME sovereign bonds (both local currency and USD-denominated) increased.

21

We use three methods to isolate the effects of unconventional monetary policy of the US, but we
find UMP was rarely important. The low-frequency (annual) data we use is potentially hiding important
effects; for example, shocks in June could be undone by December. Still, the contrast between the
importance of US long-term rates and UMP is striking.
The interesting stylized fact from Burger et al. (2017) that the home bias is, at least in part, a home
currency bias—US investors exhibit no home bias against some countries’ USD bonds—is also evident
here. Our sectoral analysis provides additional insight. Relative investment weights, whether for sovereign
or corporate bonds, are always substantially higher for USD-denominated bonds than local currency
bonds. And while the home bias against sovereign local currency bonds is substantial, it pales in
comparison to that against corporate local currency bonds. Indeed, to a first approximation, EME
corporates can only reach US investors if they issue USD-denominated bonds.

Table 3. Bond Market Structure Regressions
The annual panel data spans 2007 to 2015 and includes 15 Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). Because of data
limitations, some EMEs enter the panel later than 2007. In Table 3a, time-fixed effects are included and
independent variables are, in the order that they are listed, local currency bonds (all, sovereign or private)
scaled by GDP; foreign currency bonds (all, sovereign or private) scaled by GDP; and the share of local currency
to total bonds (all, sovereign or private). Independent variables are, in order, fiscal balance (scaled by GDP),
current account balance (scaled by GDP), inflation volatility, real GDP growth, size of the local economy
(calculated as the log nominal GDP in USD), our Regulatory quality/Creditor Rights variable and openness. In
Panels b-d, the time-fixed effects are replaced by global variables (the non-LSAP portion of US 10-year Treasury
yields and the LSAP effect on US 10-year Treasury yields). Constants are included but not reported. Estimates are
calculated using panel-feasible generalized least squares (FGLS), allowing for heteroscedastic error structures
and different autocorrelation coefficients within countries. p-values are reported in parentheses. ***, ** and *
denote significance levels at 1%, 5% and 10%, respectively. Wald tests (not reported) show that the explanatory
variables are always jointly significant.

Table 5. Determinants of US Investment in Local Currency Bonds

This note is for Tables 5 and 6. In both, sovereign bonds are in Panel a and private-sector bonds are in Panel b.
Annual panels span the period 2007 to 2015 and includes 15 EMEs. Because of data limitations, some EMEs
enter the panel later than 2007. Dependent variables are normalized relative weights for local currency bonds in
Table 5 and USD-denominated bonds in Table 6. Constants are included but not reported. Estimates are
calculated using panel-feasible generalized least squares (FGLS), allowing for heteroscedastic error structures and
different autocorrelation coefficients within countries. Standard errors are reported in parentheses. ***, ** and *
denote significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels, respectively.
