Addressing the Opioid Epidemic: Is There a Role for Physician Education?

NBER Working Paper No. 23645
August 2017, Revised November 2017
JEL No. I1,I18
ABSTRACT
Using national data on opioid prescriptions written by physicians from 2006 to 2014, we uncover
a striking relationship between opioid prescribing and medical school rank. Even within the same
specialty and practice location, physicians who completed their initial training at top medical
schools write significantly fewer opioid prescriptions annually than physicians from lower ranked
schools. Additional evidence suggests that some of this gradient represents a causal effect of
education rather than patient selection across physicians or physician selection across medical
schools. Altering physician education may therefore be a useful policy tool in fighting the current
epidemic.

I. Introduction
Between 2000 and 2014, drug overdoses involving opioids rose 200%, fueling widespread
concern about an opioid epidemic and spurring calls for changes in public policy (Chen et al.,
2014; Dart et al., 2015; Rudd et al., 2016). A distinguishing feature of the current epidemic of
drug abuse is that many overdoses and deaths can be attributed to legal opioids that were
prescribed by a physician. The clinical use of opioids in the United States has quadrupled since
1999, contributing to the rise in drug overdoses, emergency room visits, and admissions for drug
treatment. Despite significant efforts to restrict the prescribing of opioids over the past decade,
prescription opioid abuse and drug overdoses due to prescription opioids have continued to rise
(Health and Human Services, 2014; Meara et al., 2016).
Recent evidence suggests that doctors play a key role in the opioid epidemic. While
prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs)—prescription databases that allow physicians
to check for signs of opioid abuse before prescribing—have little effect on average (Paulozzi et
al., 2011; Reifler et al., 2012; Haegerich et al., 2014; Meara et al., 2016), research shows that
they are more effective when states require physicians to consult them (Dowell et al., 2016;
Buchmueller and Carey, 2017; Dave et al., 2017). Furthermore, among patients treated in the
same emergency room, Barnett et al. (2017) demonstrate that those who happen to be treated by
a physician with a higher propensity to prescribe opioids are more likely to be dependent on
opioids 12 months later. Despite being the gatekeepers of the legal opioid supply, very little is
known about why some physicians are more likely to prescribe opioids than others1 or about
what role physician training can play in bringing the epidemic under control.

1

Recent evidence documents differences in opioid prescribing by medical specialty (Volkow et al., 2011; Ringwalt
et al., 2014; Levy et al., 2015).

In this paper, we use comprehensive data on all opioid prescriptions written by doctors in
the US between 2006 and 2014 to examine the relationship between opioid prescribing and
training. In particular, we ask how the number of opioid prescriptions written yearly by
individual physicians varies with a key feature of the school where they received their initial
medical training: the rank of the medical school.2 As general practitioners (GPs) account for 48%
of opioid prescriptions written by physicians in our sample, we examine the relationship between
medical school rank and opioid prescriptions both across all physicians and separately for GPs.3
We find that where a doctor received his/her initial training matters in terms of predicting
how likely they are to prescribe opioids: physicians trained at the lowest ranked US medical
schools prescribe nearly three times as many opioids per year as physicians trained at the top
medical school. This striking inverse relationship reflects two factors: (1) physicians from lower
ranked medical schools are more likely to write any opioid prescriptions; and (2) conditional on
being an opioid prescriber, physicians for lower ranked medical schools write more opioid
prescriptions on average. This prescribing gradient is particularly pronounced among GPs. Our
results demonstrate that if all GPs prescribed like those from the top ranked school, we would
have had 56.5% fewer opioid prescriptions and 8.5% fewer deaths over the period 2006 to 2014.
Differences in the propensity to prescribe opioids across medical schools need not reflect
a causal effect of training. If physicians from lower ranked medical schools systematically see
patients with a greater need for opioids, then at least part of the relationship between medical
school rank and prescribing will reflect patient sorting across physicians. Furthermore, if people
who have a higher probability of getting into selective medical schools are systematically less
2

Our data does not include information on the number of patients seen by each physician. Using data for Medicare
Part D, we demonstrate that our results are robust to using opioid prescription rates (total prescriptions/ number of
unique patients) in the Medicare population.

We define GPs as physicians in general practice, family practice, and internal medicine. Results are quite similar
if we exclude internal medicine.

likely to write opioid prescriptions ex ante, then the prescribing gradient will also reflect
selection into medical schools. While we cannot definitively quantify the role of training, we
provide three additional sets of analyses that suggest that selection alone cannot account for the
differences in prescribing habits that we observe across medical school ranks.
First, we demonstrate that the relationship between opioid prescriptions and medical
school rank persists conditional on physician specialty and county of practice.4 It is therefore
unlikely that differences in patient need across physicians can account for the entirety of the
prescribing gradient. Second, we demonstrate that the prescribing gradient is flatter among
physicians in specialties that receive specific training in the use of opioids after medical school.
If physicians who go on to prescribe fewer opioids select into higher ranked medical schools (or
if patients with a high need for opioids sort towards physicians from lower ranked schools), then
the prescribing gradient should not be dependent on subsequent training in pain management.
Finally, we demonstrate that the prescribing gradient is flatter in more recent cohorts. Since
selectivity at top medical schools has been increasing over time, a story of selection would
instead imply that the relationship should be stronger in more recent cohorts.
This paper contributes to a growing empirical literature on policies to address the opioid
epidemic. In addition to the introduction of PDMPs,5 researchers have examined the impact of
the introduction of abuse-deterrent opioids (Cicero and Ellis, 2012; Alpert et al., 2016; Evans et
al., 2017), the strengthening of pain clinic laws (Kennedy-Hendricks et al., 2016; Meinhofer,
2016), and improvements in access to opioid antagonists such as naloxone (Mueller et al., 2015;
Rees et al., 2017) on opioid abuse and related health outcomes. To the best of our knowledge,

4

Taking this analysis a step further, we also demonstrate that a prescribing gradient exists among specialists who
practice in the exact same hospital or clinic.

this is the first study to examine whether additional physician training is likely to have a
significant role to play in addressing the opioid epidemic.
This paper further contributes to a large literature in health economics on the
determinants of physician practice style. While a physician’s network is known to influence how
they practice (Coleman et al., 1957; Soumerai et al., 1998; Epstein and Nicholson, 2009; Lucas
et al., 2010), the rank of a physician’s initial medical school is one aspect of a physician’s
network that has received surprisingly little attention. A notable exception is Doyle et al. (2010),
who demonstrate that patients randomly assigned to a doctor who attended a higher ranked
medical school have less expensive stays but no difference in health outcomes compared to
patients who instead see physicians from a lower ranked program.6
Finally, we contribute to a literature on the impacts of selectivity in higher education on
subsequent outcomes. While the literature on the effects of university rank highlights that at least
some of the “effect” of going to a higher ranked school is the result of selection into schools
rather than a consequence of any difference in the education received, the evidence suggests that
there are economic returns to attending more selective institutions (Brewer et al., 1999; Dale and
Krueger, 2002; Hoekstra, 2009; Hoxby, 2016). Our work demonstrates that the value-added of
attending a selective medical school may include broader public health benefits resulting from
differences in clinical practice as a result of the training received.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section II introduces the data. Section III asks how the
number of annual opioid prescriptions written by individual physicians varies with the rank of
the medical school where they were initially training. Section IV introduces three sets of

Although not focused on practice style, Hartz (1999) finds that surgeons who trained at prestigious residency or
fellowship programs are more likely to be regarded as a “best doctor” by other physicians in the same market.

empirical exercises that can be used to probe whether a causal effect of training contributes to the
prescribing gradient that we observe. Section V provides the results from these ancillary
analyses. Section VI discusses limitations of our study and provides a variety of robustness
checks to help mitigate these concerns. Section VII provides a discussion and conclusions.

II. Data
To examine the relationship between opioid prescribing and training, we combine prescription
data from QuintilesIMS with medical school rankings from US News and World Report and a
new dataset documenting the countries of over 900 foreign medical schools. This data is
supplemented with locations of teaching hospitals from the American Hospital Association's
(AHA) annual surveys, physician-level opioid prescription rates from the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services’ (CMS) 2014 provider utilization and payment data, county-level
characteristics from the five-year pooled 2008-2012 American Community Survey (ACS), and
county-level mortality from the US Mortality Files.
Our primary prescription data was purchased from QuintilesIMS, a public company
specializing in pharmaceutical market intelligence. This dataset contains the number of
prescriptions filled for opioid analgesics at US retail pharmacies in each year from 2006 to 2014
at the prescriber level. In addition to the number of prescriptions, the QuintilesIMS data contain
information on each prescriber provided by the American Medical Association (AMA). In
particular, we know each prescriber’s specialty, current practice address as of 2014, the medical
school where they obtained their first medical degree, and the year in which they graduated from
medical school. We use ArcGIS to extract each provider’s county of practice from their practice
address. To create the sample of physicians used in the paper, we keep active physicians who

6

graduated from medical school before 2006 and are not missing any information necessary for
our analysis.7
We therefore have nine observations for every physician in our sample—one for each
year between 2006 and 2014. Altogether, 2.16 billion opioid prescriptions were written between
2006 and 2014; 72.9% of these were written by the 742,297 physicians in our cleaned sample.8
Although GPs (here defined as physicians in general practice, family practice, and internal
medicine) make up only 27.4% of our sample, they wrote 48.2% of all opioids prescribed by
physicians between 2006 and 2014 (35.1% of all opioid prescriptions). See Table S2 for an
overview of these summary statistics.
There was a continuous increase in the number of opioid prescriptions from2.04 million
in 2006 to 2.6 million in 2012 and then a slight moderation. Nevertheless, in 2014 the average
physician still wrote 221.7 opioid prescriptions. This figure includes zeros—in 2014, 28.3% of
physicians did not write any opioid prescriptions. Among physicians in general practice, these
statistics are even more striking: only 16.2% of GPs wrote no opioid prescriptions in 2014 with
opioid-prescribing GPs writing 480.3 prescriptions on average.
In order to rank medical schools, we use US News and World Report's “Best Medical

7

In particular, we keep prescribers whose status is listed as “active” in 2014 (94.20% of prescribers) and who list a
specialty that requires either the degree of medical doctor (MD) or doctor of osteopathic medicine (DO). We
exclude physicians whose medical school is not provided or whose medical school name is ambiguous (2.29% of
active physicians have missing medical school; 0.12% of active physicians list “University of Medicine” or “College
of Medical Sciences” as their medical school). We also exclude prescribers who list a P.O. Box, a home address, or
an address of unknown type (0.49% of remaining physicians) in place of an office address as well as physicians
whose offices are in US territories (0.06% of remaining physicians). Finally, to avoid including physicians who are
still doing a residency or other training, we exclude physicians who graduated medical school in 2006 or later
(15.93% of remaining physicians). Note that we purchased data from QuintilesIMS for both anti-depressant and
opioid prescriptions. Of physicians who appear in the AMA data set, only 0.45% do not appear in our Quintiles
IMS prescription data.
8
19.1% of the remaining prescriptions were written by non-physician providers including dentists, nurse
practitioners, and physician assistants. We exclude non-physician providers from our analysis since our data
includes no information on where they were trained.

Schools: Research Rankings.”9 Although medical school rankings change from year to year, we
construct a composite medical school rank to use in our analyses. In particular, we take the
average of a school's non-missing rankings from 2010 to 2017 and then re-rank schools
according to this average rank (assigning a rank of “1” to the school with the lowest average
rank, “2” to the school with the next lowest average rank, and so on).10 Refer to Table S1 for a
list of these composite rankings while Figure S2 shows how stable our composite ranking is from
2010 to 2017. The pairwise correlation coefficients are all greater than 0.96 across annual
rankings from 2010 to 2017.
There are 92 ranked medical schools and 55 unranked US medical schools in these data.
We divide unranked schools by whether they grant the degree of medical doctor (MD) or doctor
of osteopathic medicine (DO) (35 and 20 medical schools, respectively).
We group foreign medical schools based on the UN's “Classification of Countries by
Major Area and Region of the World.”11 While the QuintilesIMS data does not provide
information on the location of each medical school, we googled all medical schools with 10 or
more opioid prescribers in the main sample and recorded the country of the school's primary
campus (902 medical schools). Foreign medical schools with fewer than 10 opioid prescribers in
the main sample are labeled as “Uncategorized” (695 medical schools). Refer to Figure S1 for
the distribution of medical schools and physicians in our data across world regions.
While the QuintilesIMS data contain information representative of all opioid
prescriptions filled at US retail pharmacies, it is not without limitations. As of 2014, they directly

We exclude schools that are ranked in only one or two years over the sample (eight medical schools). Of the

survey 86% of retail pharmacies, with the remaining prescriptions imputed to add to industry
totals using a patented projection method. The fraction of pharmacies directly surveyed has
increased slightly since 2006. Since hospital pharmacies are not included in the data,
prescriptions of specialists who practice primarily in hospitals (such as surgeons) may be underrepresented. This is one motivation for looking at the relationship between prescribing and rank
by specialty as discussed further below. Also, the QuintilesIMS “Xponents” data we were able
to purchase contained no information on the number of patients seen by each physician or about
the strength or number of pills included in each prescription. We use three additional datasets to
verify that these data shortcomings are unlikely to drive our results.
First, using the AHA’s annual surveys from 2007 to 2013, we demonstrate that our
results are robust to excluding physicians who practice in a zip code containing a universityaffiliated hospital. We consider a zip code as containing a university-affiliated hospital if it
contained a hospital that reported a university affiliation to the AMA in any year between 2007
and 2013. According to this measure, 9.4% of zip codes with any physicians in our data include a
university-affiliated hospital.
Second, using publicly available data from CMS’s Medicare Part D provider utilization
and payment data files,12 we demonstrate that our results are consistent to using opioid
prescription rates as opposed to prescription levels in the Medicare population. While this data
does not include information on each physician’s medical school, we merge the Medicare Part D
data with CMS’s publicly available Physician Compare database to extract this information.13,14

14
This merge is not perfect. According to CMS, clinicians are only listed on Physician Compare if they are in
“approved” status in the Medicare enrollment system (PECOS), have a specialty and at least one practice address
listed, and submit at least one Medicare Fee-For-Service claim within the past 12 months.

9

Finally, using county-level deaths from the US Vital Statistics Mortality Files, we
demonstrate that the number of opioid prescriptions correlate with deaths involving drugs. To
measure “deaths involving drugs,” we include all deaths where either the underlying cause of
death or a condition contributing to death indicates accidental poisoning by and exposure to
drugs (ICD-10 codes X40-X44); intentional self-poisoning by exposure to drugs (ICD-10 codes
X60-X64); poisoning by and exposure to drugs (ICD-10 codes Y10-Y14); and poisoning by,
adverse effects of, or under dosing of drugs excluding anesthetics (ICD-10 codes T40, T42,
T43). We further include deaths where drug dependence, excluding alcohol or tobacco, is
indicated on the death certificate (ICD-10 codes F11-F16, F18, F19).15 Summary statistics for the
annual, county-level mortality measures that we use are provided in Table S3. There was a clear
upward trend in deaths due to drugs between 2006 and 2014 from 12.9 to 17.4 per 100,000—a
trend that has received a great deal of recent attention (c.f. Case and Deaton, 2015).

III. Opioid Prescriptions and Medical School Rankings
We are interested in whether the propensity to prescribe opioids is associated with the rank of the
medical school where a physician attained his/her initial medical education. We consider three
outcomes: (1) the number of opioid prescriptions written annually by each physician including
physician-years with no opioid prescriptions, (2) the number of opioid prescriptions excluding
physician-years with no opioid prescriptions, and (3) an indicator denoting physician-years with
at least one opioid prescription. As GPs account for nearly half of the opioid prescriptions
written in the sample (Table S2), we look at all physicians as well as GPs separately. For ease of

15

Our results are robust to only including deaths where a drug overdose is listed as the cause of death.

10

presentation, we present graphs summarizing the empirical findings as well as tables with
regression output.
Figure 1 shows the average number of opioid prescriptions written yearly per physician
by medical school rank, both among all physicians (Subfigure A) and among GPs (Subfigure B).
We see that a higher medical school rank is associated with fewer opioid prescriptions: on
average, physicians from the lowest ranked US medical schools write three times as many opioid
prescriptions as physicians trained at Harvard Medical School, the top ranked school. While GPs
trained at Harvard write an average of 180.2 opioid prescriptions per year, GPs from the lowest
ranked US medical schools write an average of nearly 550 opioid prescriptions per year (Table
S5).
This striking inverse relationship between the number of annual opioid prescriptions and
medical school rank reflects two factors: (1) physicians from higher ranked medical schools are
less likely to write any opioid prescriptions; and (2) conditional on writing any opioid
prescription, physicians from higher ranked medical schools write fewer opioid prescriptions on
average. Only 65% of physicians trained at Harvard Medical School wrote at least one opioid
prescription in a given year between 2006 and 2014 compared to nearly 80% of physicians from
the lowest ranked medical schools (see Figure S3 and Table S4 for all physicians and Figure S4
and Table S5 for the analogous information for GPs). Conditional on prescribing opioids, the
behavior of physicians likewise varies with medical school rank: on average, opioid prescribers
from the lowest ranked medical schools write over 160% more opioid prescriptions per year than
opioid prescribers from Harvard (146.4 versus 381.6; see Table S4).
Turning to the results for physicians trained at unranked medical schools, we see from
Figure 1 that foreign doctors have similar prescribing habits as physicians trained at mid-tier US

11

schools, while MDs from unranked US schools are closer to the average for physicians from the
lowest ranked schools. This is true both among all physicians (Subfigure A) and among GPs
(Subfigure B). Comparing the prescribing habits of DOs to MDs, we see that DOs in general
practice prescribe similarly to GPs trained at the lowest ranked US schools. However, at an
average of over 400 opioid prescriptions annually per physician, DOs across all specialties write
more opioid prescriptions per prescriber than MDs trained either domestically or abroad.

IV. Empirical Strategy
The striking inverse relationship between opioid prescribing and medical school rank
documented in Section III begs the question of why such a relationship exists. It is possible that
medical schools have differing approaches to the tradeoff between pain management and
addiction and instill different beliefs among their graduates about the appropriate clinical use of
opioids. However, a prescribing gradient across medical school rankings need not reflect a causal
effect of training. There are two key threats to attributing the raw prescribing gradient to
differences in training:
1.! If physicians from lower ranked medical schools are systematically more likely to see
patients with a greater need for opioids, then at least part of the relationship between
medical school rank and prescribing will reflect patient sorting across physicians.16
2.! If physicians who have a higher probability of getting into a higher ranked medical
school have a lower propensity to prescribe opioids ex ante, then at least part of the

16

We note that only a particular type of patient sorting threatens a causal interpretation of the relationship between
opioid prescribing and medical school rank. If patients sort towards physicians from lower ranked medical schools
based on medical need, then the relationship between opioid prescribing and medical school rank cannot be
attributed (at least entirely) to a causal effect of training. If, however, patients sort towards physicians from lower
ranked medical schools based on a desire to misuse or abuse opioids (for example because physicians from lowranked schools are known to be more lenient prescribers), then this endogenous sorting is a consequence of the
differences in prescribing practices that we want to capture.

12

relationship between medical school and prescribing will reflect physician sorting
across medical schools.
While we do not have the data necessary to test whether physicians select into medical
schools based on their outlooks towards opioids (or, more realistically, whether physicians select
into medical schools based on characteristics that are correlated with their outlooks towards
opioids), we can examine whether physicians from lower ranked medical schools are more likely
to encounter patients with a greater medical need for opioids. In particular, we can examine
whether physicians from lower ranked medical schools are systematically more likely to practice
in specialties and/or locations where patient need for opioids may be higher.
As shown in Table 1, there are differences in both the specialties and practice locations
chosen across medical school rankings. The eight specialties shown in the table are the top eight
opioid-prescribing specialties (Table S6) and together account for 84% of opioid prescriptions in
our sample. The table makes clear that while as a group, GPs prescribe the most opioids, this is
because they are the most numerous practitioners. Not surprisingly, other specialties, such as
those in pain medicine, prescribe much more on a per capita basis.
While only 20% of doctors from the top 30 medical schools are in general practice, over
50% of DOs are GPs. Furthermore, while doctors from the top 30 schools tend to practice in
places with greater population density, lower percentages of white inhabitants, and higher
education levels (that is, in more urban settings), DOs practice in areas with low population
density, a high percentage of white inhabitants, and the highest percentage of less educated
residents. If, for example, GPs who practice in more rural settings see patients with a greater
need for opioids, then the patterns documented in Figures 1 and S3 could reflect differences in
the specialties and practice locations chosen across medical school rankings.

13

In the following section, we provide three sets of additional analyses that together
provide evidence that neither patient sorting across physicians nor physician sorting across
medical schools can account for all of the prescribing gradient that we observe. First, to control
for differences in patient need, we replicate the analysis from Section III conditional on specialty
and county of practice fixed effects. In particular, we estimate regressions of the following form:
(1) Yitc = βRanki + δSpecialtyi + αc + γt + eitc
where Yitc denotes the number of opioid prescriptions written by doctor i in year t in county c;
Specialtyi, αc, and γt denote specialty, county, and year fixed effects, respectively; and eitc is an
error term. In some specifications, county fixed effects are replaced with either exact practice
address fixed effects or a vector of county characteristics. Ranki is a vector of indicators for
medical school rank group. Harvard is the top ranked medical school, followed by schools
ranked 2-5, 6-10, etc. Including this vector of indicators allows the effect of school rank to be
non-linear. We further include separate indicators for unranked schools that grant MDs,
unranked schools that grant DOs, and foreign schools. With the inclusion of county and specialty
fixed effects, the parameters of interest—the vector β—are identified using variation in the
number of prescriptions written by physicians within the same specialty who attended different
medical school but who practice in the same county. Standard errors are clustered by physician.
While Equation (1) is useful for graphical analyses (the vector β can be plotted to
visualize the prescribing gradient), we would like a parsimonious way to examine how the
prescribing gradient changes when we include different controls. Hence, we also estimate
equations similar to Equation (1) where we replace indicators for medical school rank bins with a
quadratic in continuous medical school rank. That is, we estimate equations of the form:
(2) Yitc = β Ranki + β Ranki2 + δSpecialtyi

αc + γt + eitc

14

where Ranki is a continuous measure of medical school rank (graduates of Harvard receive a
value of 1, graduates of Johns Hopkins receive a values of 2, etc.) and all other variables are
defined as in Equation (1). We include a quadratic in medical school rank because results from
Equation (1) suggest that the relationship between medical school rank and annual opioid
prescriptions is approximately quadratic. As there in no ordinal ranking for physicians who
trained at unranked US medical schools or foreign institutions, we only include physicians who
graduated from ranked US medical schools in these regressions. As before, standard errors are
clustered by physician.
Next, instead of residualizing the number of prescriptions from specialty fixed effects, we
examine whether the prescribing gradient is different across physicians in different specialties. If
the prescribing gradient is driven entirely by patient sorting across physicians or physician
selection into medical schools, then we would expect the prescribing gradient to be similar
across specialties. If, however, there is a causal effect of training, then we would expect the
prescribing gradient to be weaker in specialties that receive subsequent training in pain
management.
To estimate the prescribing gradient across different specialties, we estimate Equations
(1) and (2) separately for the top eight opioid-prescribing specialties.17 The eight specialties with
the most opioid prescriptions over our sample period are general practice, orthopaedic surgery,
emergency medicine, pain medicine, physical medicine and rehabilitation, obstetrics and
gynecology, anesthesiology, and general surgery (see Table S6). Of these specialties, those in
pain medicine, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and anesthesiology prescribe the most on a
17

When these equations are estimated on a single specialty, specialty fixed effects are excluded. However, when we
estimate these equations only on GPs, we include sub-specialty fixed effects to account for differences across the
three categories of sub-specialties we include in our definition of GPs (general practice, family practice, and internal
medicine).

15

per capita basis and have the most detailed subsequent training in the use of pain medicines.
Finally, we examine whether the prescribing gradient is different across graduation
cohorts. While medical school rankings have been quite stable over time, the degree of
selectivity at top schools has been increasing as the market for higher education has become
national (and international) rather than being regionally segmented (Hoxby, 2009). Hence, if the
effect of medical school rank is due to the selection of more qualified people into higher ranked
schools, then we should see the effect of rank increase in more recent cohorts with increasing
selectivity. Conversely, if the effect of rank is due to differences in training offered at different
schools, and if training standards tend to diffuse downwards from the top schools over time, then
the effect of rank should be less important in more recent cohorts. To examine whether the
prescribing gradient is stronger in more selective cohorts, we estimate Equations (1) and (2)
separately for four broad cohorts: those who graduated before 1975, between 1976 and 1985,
between 1986 and 1995, and after 1996.

V. The Role of Training
We now implement the three sets of empirical exercises introduced in Section IV to investigate
whether there is evidence that the prescribing gradient we uncover in Section III is driven—at
least in part—by a causal effect of training.

Figure 2 provides coefficient estimates and 95% confidence intervals on indicators for medical
school rank bins from estimation of Equation (1), both for all physicians (Subfigure A) and for
GPs (Subfigure B). The figures are scaled so that the coefficients on the highest ranked medical
school (Harvard) are set to zero, and all other schools are compared to it. A comparison of

Figures 1 and 2 demonstrates that controlling for differences in specialties and practice locations
moderates the relationship between medical school rank and opioid prescribing. However, even
within the same specialty and county of practice, the relationship between medical school rank
and opioid prescriptions remains highly statistically significant. This is particularly true among
GPs, for whom the average number of opioid prescriptions written yearly per physician rises
steeply with medical school rank until around the rank of 60, where the curve flattens out.18
A comparison of specifications with and without controls is shown more formally in
Table 2. Here, we provide results for variants of Equation (2) estimated on all physicians (Panel
A) and using GPs alone (Panel B). Looking to the results for all physicians first, we see that a
regression of annual opioid prescriptions on medical school rank yields a best fit line of y =
117.07 + 2.44x – 0.01x2 (column (1)). Controlling for specialty (column (2)), reduces the
derivative of y with respect to x by about half, as does controlling for county-level demographics
from the ACS (column (3)).19 Comparing columns (3) and (4), we see that the estimates are very
similar whether we control for observable differences across counties or for both observable and
unobservable differences across counties using county fixed effects. Finally, column (5) shows
estimates from a specification similar to that depicted in Figure 5 in that it includes both county
and specialty fixed effects: here, the best fit line is given by y = 111.57 + 0.64x – 0.003x2.
Taking into account differences in specialties and counties of practice across medical school
rankings, doctors from the lowest ranked schools still write on average over 33 more opioid
prescriptions per year than doctors from the highest ranked schools.

18

Tables S8 and S9 show the regressions underlying Figure 2, Figure S3 and Figure S4.
Controls include population density; percent male; percent in 12 age bins; percent white, black, and Hispanic;
percent in seven education categories; percent unemployed; percent in 16 income categories; percent poverty for
three different age ranges; percent with public and private health insurance; and median age of housing stock.

19

17

While the prescribing gradient among GPs is also attenuated when we control for
specialty and county of practice, we see from the regression output in Panel B of Table 2 that a
significant gradient persists among GPs practicing in the same county. Conditional on specialty
and county of practice, GPs from the lowest ranked schools write on average over 70 more
opioid prescriptions per year than GPs from the highest ranked schools (column (5)).
Turning to the coefficients on unranked medical schools in Figure 2, we see that among
all physicians (Subfigure A), DOs write more prescriptions per prescriber than all other doctors
even when we control for differences in specialties and practice locations. Furthermore,
conditional on these controls, MDs trained at unranked US medical schools still prescribe
similarly to physicians from the lowest third of ranked US medical schools, both among all
physicians and among GPs. However, unlike in Figure 1, foreign-trained doctors actually write
fewer opioid prescriptions than US-trained doctors once we control for specialty and county of
practice.
The behavior of foreign-trained doctors is probed further in Figure 3. Here, we plot
coefficient estimates from a regression similar to the specification outlined in Equation (1)
except that the categories for ranked US schools are collapsed and indicators are added for world
region of training for foreign doctors. Conditional on specialty and county characteristics,
physicians trained in most regions outside of the US write significantly fewer opioid
prescriptions per year on average than physicians trained domestically. In fact, GPs trained in
the Caribbean, Canada, and Mexico/Central America are the only foreign-trained GPs who on
average write more opioid prescriptions per year than GPs trained at the top 30 US schools. The
stark differences between physicians trained in various regions of the world suggest considerable

18

variation in attitudes towards opioids across world regions that practitioners bring with them to
the U.S., and provides further evidence that differences in training are likely to be important.20
It is possible that we are not fully controlling for medical need by controlling for
physician specialty and county of practice. We can extend our analysis to compare the
prescribing practices of physicians who practice in the exact same hospital or clinic by including
practice address fixed effects in place of county fixed effects in Equations (1) and (2). The
results of this exercise for all physicians and GPs are shown in column (6) of Table 5 (see also
Figure S9). Even within the same practice, opioid prescribing increases with medical school
rank, although the relationship is flatter than in a specification without these controls. This
reduction in the relationship between medical school rank and prescribing practices within a
given practice location indicates either that practices tend to hire doctors with similar
propensities to prescribe opioids or that the opioid prescribing behavior of physicians is
influenced by the institutions where they practice and/or the behavior of their colleagues.

b. Prescribing Gradient Across Specialties
We next ask whether there are differences in the prescribing gradient across the top eight opioidprescribing specialties. As discussed in Section IV, if differences in opioid prescribing across
medical school ranks are in fact driven by differences in training, then we expect the rank of a
physician’s initial medical school to be a less important predictor of opioid prescribing behavior
among specialties that receive subsequent training in the use of opioids.
Figure 4 shows that there is an inverse relationship between medical school rank and
opioid prescribing in most of the top eight opioid-prescribing specialties, although the
20

Figure S5 plots similar estimates from models without county controls both for all
physicians (Subfigure A) and for GPs (Subfigure B).

19

relationship is generally much flatter in other specialties than that observed for GPs.21 This can
also be seen in Table 3, which provides estimates of Equation (2) for physicians in different
specialties. For pain medicine, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and anesthesiology—the
specialties where all practitioners could be expected to receive specific training in the use of
opioids, and which have high per capita prescribing of opioids relative to GPs22—we see
virtually no relationship between initial medical school rank and opioid prescribing, as
hypothesized above. For ER doctors, the figure indicates a relationship between rank and
prescribing that is basically flat up to about rank 50 and then increases. In the quadratic
regressions, this concavity is captured by a negative main effect and a positive coefficient on the
quadratic term, with a turnaround point right around rank 50, consistent with the figure.

c. Prescribing Gradient Across Cohorts
We next turn to the question of cohort-level differences in the relationship between
medical school rank and opioid prescribing. As discussed in Section IV, if the prescribing
gradient is driven by physician selection into medical schools, then the gradient should be
stronger in more recent cohorts due to the increasing selectivity at top medical schools.
We find that that the relationship between initial medical school rank and opioid
prescribing, while significant in all cohorts, has become consistently flatter over time. For GPs
who graduated from medical school before 1976 for instance, a regression of annual opioid
prescriptions on a quadratic in continuous medical school rank with year, specialty, and county

21

Figure S6 shows similar figures for two specialties where many observers agree that opioids are often necessary
for adequate pain relief: oncology and nephrology. These figures show that a relationship between medical school
rank and opioid prescribing exists even among specialties where the use of opioids is uncontroversial, although the
relationship is much flatter than that found for GPs.
22
As shown in Table S6, physicians in pain medicine write an average of 2,040.2 opioid prescriptions per year
compared to an average of 414.1 for GPs.

20

fixed effects (Equation (2)) yields a best fit line of y = 354.40 + 3.55x – 0.03x2 (column (2) of
Panel B) compared to the best fit line of y = 247.61 + 1.28x – 0.01x2 for the cohort that
graduated between 1996 and 2005 (column (5) of Panel B). This flattening gradient is
inconsistent with the idea that the relationship between medical school rank and opioid
prescribing is driven by selection into the top medical schools (see Figure S7 and Table S7).23

VI. Robustness
One limitation of these data is that they do not include information about the number of patients
seen by each physician. If doctors trained at top schools are more likely to engage part-time in
research or teaching and therefore see fewer patients than doctors from lower ranked medical
schools, then a correlation between medical school rank and prescriptions could emerge because
of differences in workloads. Unfortunately, there is currently no dataset available that has patient
volumes for every doctor in the US.
Despite this limitation, it is unlikely that differences in the number of patients seen can
explain our findings. Recall that a strong relationship between prescribing and school rank
remains throughout the distribution of medical schools ranks. In order for patient volume to
explain our findings, GPs from the 30th ranked schools would have to see significantly fewer
patients on average than GPs from the 40th ranked schools, for example. We do not think there is
any evidence or reason to think that this is the case. Furthermore, large differences in opioid
prescribing patterns exist across foreign-trained physicians—a significant share of practicing US
physicians—depending on the world region in which they were trained. We are not aware of
evidence suggesting that there are large differences in patient volume by region of origin.
23

Table S7 also shows results for pain medicine specialists separately. Consistent with the
figure for all cohorts, there is no statistically significant association between initial medical
school rank and opioid prescribing for pain specialists of any cohort.
21

To investigate the possibility of differential patient loads more formally, we provide two
additional analysis. First, we replicate our analysis excluding physicians who practice in a zip
code containing a university-affiliated hospital. If doctors from top-ranked medical schools see
fewer patients on average because they are more likely to engage part-time in teaching or
research, then we would expect our results to be attenuated when we exclude physicians in
university-affiliated zip codes. The results for all physicians and for GPs are remarkably
consistent with those discussed above (see Table S10, and Figure S8).
Second, since publicly available Medicare data includes information on both the number
of Medicare beneficiaries seen and the number of opioid prescriptions written, we can verify that
our results are robust to using a prescription rate (total prescriptions divided by the total number
of unique patients) in the Medicare population. As shown in Figure 5, using total prescriptions or
prescription rates paints a very similar picture: physicians who attended higher ranked medical
schools prescribe significantly fewer opioids.
Another limitation of the QuintilesIMS data is that we do not know either the number or
the strength of the pills included in each prescription. To the extent that physicians trained in
different specialties tend to prescribe opioids of different strengths, estimating models by
specialty as we have done above will help to mitigate the problem. Still, even within specialty, if
physicians trained at top schools always write prescriptions for a month’s supply of high-dose
opioids, whereas physicians trained at lower ranked schools always write prescriptions for a few
low-dose pills, then differences in the number of prescriptions could emerge without this
association having any bearing on the overall provision of opioids. However, even when looking
within a given county over time, there is a significant relationship between the number of opioid
prescriptions and deaths involving drugs: On average, a 10% increase in opioid prescriptions

22

annually is associated with a 1.5% increase in deaths involving drugs each year (see Table S11).
This relationship suggests that differences in prescribing patterns are not fully offset by
differences in the number or strength of pills prescribed, and thus that it is meaningful to look at
the number of prescriptions as an indicator of physician practice style.
A final limitation is that we only observe where each physician completed his or her
initial medical training. Hence we cannot say how the rankings of institutions where physicians
receive subsequent training are related to the propensity to prescribe opioids. However, the fact
that physicians in specialties with significant further training in pain management have flatter
relationships between opioid prescribing and initial medical school rank strongly suggests that
the nature and type of further training is an important determinant of physician practice style. If
physicians who receive their initial training at top medical schools are more likely to go on to
residencies that offer better training in the use of pain medications, then this could be viewed as
one of the mechanisms whereby initial medical school rank affects prescribing behavior.

VII. Discussion and Conclusions
This study offers several new facts about how doctor characteristics are related to their
propensity to prescribe opioids. First, between 2006 and 2014, nearly half of all opioids
prescribed by doctors were prescribed by GPs. This is true even though doctors in some
specialties, like pain medicine, write many more prescriptions per practitioner. Thus, it will be
important to understand and modify the prescribing behavior of GPs as well as those of doctors
in certain key specialties like pain medicine if the opioid epidemic is to be successfully
addressed.
Second, there is a striking inverse relationship between the rank of a physician’s medical
school and his/her propensity to prescribe opioids, especially among GPs. Previous research
23

indicating that differences in practice style are largely set as early as the first year of medical
practice (Epstein et al., 2016) suggests that the relationship between initial medical school rank
and opioid prescribing behavior could reflect differences in training regarding the appropriate
use of opioids across schools. An alternative hypothesis is that the estimated effect of medical
school rank on the propensity to prescribe opioids reflects differences in either the types of
patients seen by physicians who attend medical schools of higher and lower rank or the types of
physicians who are selected into these schools.
While we cannot definitively rule out these alternatives, our ancillary results support the
training hypothesis. In particular, the relationship between medical school rank and propensity to
prescribe opioids persists even among specialists who attended different medical schools but
practice in the exact same hospital or clinic—where patients can be assumed to be relatively
homogenous in their need for opioids. Furthermore, the prescribing gradient is less pronounced
in specialties in which physicians might be expected to receive specialized training in dealing
with pain medications, such as pain medicine and anesthesiology. Finally, given the increasing
competition to get into top ranked medical schools, the fact that the relationship between medical
school rank and prescribing behavior has weakened over time (rather than strengthening) further
suggests that the relationship reflects the more rapid diffusion of best practices in top schools
rather than the selection of certain types of physicians.
We cannot know how training regarding opioids has differed across medical schools over
time, or even whether the differences in prescribing practices that we see reflect specific training
about opioids. They might, for example, reflect more subtle differences in how doctors are
taught to think about potential harms from medication, or periodic reviews of medications that

24

patients are taking. Or they might reflect physician attitudes towards evidence-based medicine
more generally.
A review of the curricula at all four medical schools in Massachusetts found that there
was no standard in place to make sure that all students were taught safe and effective opioidprescribing practices before graduation (Antman et al., 2016). Recognizing that more
comprehensive training will be needed to improve prescriber practices, in March 2016 the White
House asked medical schools to pledge to include the Center for Disease Control’s new opioidprescribing guidelines in their curriculum. Over 60 medical schools announced that they would
update their curriculum by the fall of 2016, with 28% (43%) of ranked (unranked) US medical
schools taking the pledge.24 If such training is effective in reducing opioid prescribing, then
policy makers might consider offering stronger inducements for medical schools to incorporate
these guidelines.
Taken together, our findings suggest that a doctor’s initial training has a large impact on
their attitudes towards opioid prescribing, especially for GPs who are less likely to receive
subsequent training in pain management. Since variations in opioid prescribing have contributed
to deaths due to the current opioid epidemic, training aimed at reducing prescribing rates among
the most liberal prescribers—who disproportionately come from the lowest ranked medical
schools—could possibly have large public health benefits. Physician education targeted to the
physicians responsible for the majority of the prescribing therefore likely has a role to play in
addressing the opioid epidemic.

Notes: The above figures depict the coefficient estimates on indicators for medical school rank bins for US-trained physicians and regions of
training for foreign-trained physicians from regressions of opioid prescriptions at the physician-year level on medical school rank bin or region
indicators with year, specialty, and county fixed effects (variants of Equation (1)). Subfigure A includes all physicians; Subfigure B only includes
GPs (physicians in general practice, family practice, and internal medicine). Physician-years with zero opioid prescriptions are included. The bars
denote 95% confidence intervals; standard errors are clustered by physician. Refer to Tables S8 and S9 for the underlying coefficient estimates for
all physicians and GPs, respectively.

Notes: The above figures depict the (i) average number of opioid prescriptions written per physician and the (ii) average opioid prescription rate
per physician in Medicare Part D in 2014. Subfigure A includes all physicians; Subfigure B only includes GPs (physicians in general practice,
family practice, and internal medicine). Data on both the number of opioid prescriptions billed to Medicare Part D and the number of Medicare
beneficiaries seen per physician are taken from CMS’s public use Medicare files; this data is merged via NPI with CMS’s Physician Compare
database to extract medical school for each provider.

N physicians
N medical schools
Notes: Rankings for the top 92 US schools are defined as in Section II. US medical schools that are not ranked are divided by whether they grant the
degree of DO or MD. Foreign medical schools are grouped according to the UN’s classification of countries by world regions. For foreign medical
schools with 10 or more opioid prescribers in our main sample, we googled the medical school and recorded the country of the school’s primary
campus. For foreign medical schools with fewer than 10 opioid prescribers in our main sample, we assign the medical school to the “Uncategorized”
group.

Notes: The above figure depicts how our composite ranking compares to annual rankings from 2010 to 2017. For each composite rank on the x-axis,
there are up to eight observations denoting the corresponding medical school’s rank in each year between 2010 and 2017. Annual rankings from
2010-2016 are denoted by a point; the most recent ratings (2017) are denoted by a cross.

Notes: Standard errors are displayed in parentheses and are clustered by physician. The top row displays the total number of opioids dispensed as
reported in the QuintilesIMS data. The next two panels provide summary statistics for our cleaned sample of physicians (Panel A) and GPs (Panel
B; physicians in general practice, family practice, and internal medicine). The prescription statistics are raw averages; that is, they do not control
for physician specialty or county of practice.

Notes: The above table presents output from regressions of opioid prescriptions at the physician-year level on a quadratic in medical school rank
with year, specialty, and county fixed effects (Equation (2)) estimated separately across different graduation cohorts. Standard errors are clustered
by physician. Panel A includes all physicians; Panel B only includes GPs (physicians in general practice, family practice, and internal medicine);
Panel C only includes physicians specializing in pain medicine.

Notes: The above table presents output from regressions of opioid prescriptions at the physician-year level on a quadratic in medical school rank
with year, specialty, and county fixed effects (Equation (2)). Columns (1)-(2) include all physicians; Columns (3)-(4) only include GPs (physicians
in general practice, family practice, and internal medicine). Columns (2) and (4) exclude physicians whose practice address is in a zip code with a
university-affiliated hospital. Standard errors are clustered by physician.

Notes: The above table presents output from regressions of log deaths involving drugs per capita at the county-year year on log opioid prescriptions
per capita at the county-year level. All specifications include year fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by county. We define “deaths involving
drugs” as both poisonings from drugs resulting in death as well as deaths in which drug dependence was indicated on the death certificate.
