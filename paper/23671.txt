Globalization and the Increasing Correlation between Capital Inflows and Outflows
J. Scott Davis and Eric van Wincoop
NBER Working Paper No. 23671
August 2017
JEL No. F3,F41
ABSTRACT
We document that the correlation between capital inflows and outflows has increased
substantially over time in a sample of 128 advanced and developing countries. We provide
evidence that this is a result of an increase in financial globalization (stock of external assets and
liabilities). This dominates the effect of an increase in trade globalization (exports plus imports),
which reduces the correlation between capital inflows and outflows. In the context of a twocountry model with 14 shocks we show that the theoretical impact of financial and trade
globalization on the correlation between capital inflows and outflows is consistent with the data.

Introduction

Gross international asset positions and capital ‡ows have grown enormously in size over the past
three decades, which has raised signi…cant concerns about …nancial and macroeconomic stability in
the face of surges and stops of capital ‡ows. However, Forbes and Warnock (2012) point out that
a sudden stop of capital in‡ows is increasingly accompanied by reduced out‡ows (retrenchment),
dampening the impact on net ‡ows.1 Similarly, large capital ‡ight (out‡ows) is increasingly
accompanied by a surge in capital in‡ows. Broner et al. (2013) document that capital in‡ows and
out‡ows have become signi…cantly more correlated in countries of all income levels from the 1980s
to the 2000s and are highest in high-income countries. The objective of this paper is to shed light
on what drives this phenomenon of increasingly correlated in‡ows and out‡ows.
There has been some discussion in the literature about why capital in‡ows and out‡ows would
be positively correlated at all. Broner et al. (2013) argue that one would expect a negative
correlation in a model with time-varying expected returns, as for example in RBC models with
productivity shocks. A higher expected return in the United States should lead both US and
foreign investors to shift their portfolio to the US, leading to larger US capital in‡ows and lower
out‡ows. The same negative correlation between in‡ows and out‡ows can be expected when there
are changes in the relative riskiness of US assets. Broner et al. (2013) argue that without …nancial
or other frictions, we cannot explain the positive correlation between in‡ows and out‡ows.
Tille and van Wincoop (2010) provide a broader perspective on the relationship between capital
in‡ows and out‡ows from a portfolio perspective. Capital ‡ows have a portfolio growth component
(associated with saving) and a portfolio reallocation component (e.g. due to changes in expected
returns and risk). The portfolio growth component can generate a positive correlation between
in‡ows and out‡ows when saving is positively correlated across countries. Portfolio reallocation
generates a negative correlation between in‡ows and out‡ows when domestic and foreign agents
face the same portfolio problem and therefore shift their portfolios in the same direction, as in the
examples above. Broner et al. (2013) therefore emphasize that asymmetries across countries are
needed to generate a positive correlation between in‡ows and out‡ows across countries.
Many examples of such asymmetries have been developed in the literature, leading to di¤erences
in expected returns and risk from the perspective of domestic and foreign investors and contributing
to a positive correlation between capital in‡ows and out‡ows. Expected returns may be di¤erent
across countries due to information asymmetries (Tille and van Wincoop (2014), Brennan and Cao
(1997)) or to costs associated with investing abroad. Foreign assets may be perceived to be riskier
due to exchange rate risk (Broner et al. (2013)) or expropriation risk (Gourio et al. (2016)). An
increase in global risk or risk-aversion will then lead to a general retrenchment towards domestic
assets, lowering both in‡ows and out‡ows. Such a global retrenchment is documented by MilesiFerretti and Tille (2011) for the 2008-2009 global …nancial crisis.2 Rey (2013) casts this more

Throughout the paper capital in‡ows are net purchases of domestic assets by foreign residents and capital
out‡ows are net purchases of foreign assets by domestic residents.

Further evidence of retrenchment during the global …nancial crisis is in Giannetti and Laeven (2012) for the
syndicated loan market.

broadly as part of a global …nancial cycle.3 Tille and van Wincoop (2010) show that in‡ows and
out‡ows become positively correlated due to various types of time-varying risk that impact foreign
and domestic investors di¤erently. This may be due to a di¤erent optimal hedge against in‡ation
or future expected returns or non-asset income.4
In this paper the aim is not to explain a positive correlation between capital in‡ows and
out‡ows, but rather the signi…cant increase in this correlation over time and the much higher
correlation in developed countries than in developing countries. For example, in Table 2 we
report that among industrialized countries the correlation between capital in‡ows and out‡ows,
normalized by external assets and liabilities, rose from 0.25 during 1970-1990 to 0.87 during 19902011. For emerging markets the increase was from 0.07 to 0.48. Similar numbers apply when
we divide capital ‡ows by GDP. The explanation for this phenomenon does not require larger
asymmetries across countries, as the discussion above might suggest. It also does not require a
larger size of the shocks that are responsible for a positive correlation between in‡ows and out‡ows,
such as larger global risk shocks. The explanation is much simpler. We argue that it is a simple
corollary of …nancial globalization.
To understand this better, it is useful to distinguish between net ‡ows and gross ‡ows. Net
‡ows, N F , are equal to capital out‡ows minus in‡ows, which equals the current account. These
are commonly referred to as “global imbalances.” We de…ne gross ‡ows, GF , as the sum of capital
out‡ows and in‡ows. It follows that
Outf lows = 0:5GF + 0:5N F
Inf lows = 0:5GF

0:5N F

It is immediate that gross ‡ows generate a perfect positive correlation between in‡ows and out‡ows,
while net ‡ows generate a perfect negative correlation. A higher correlation between capital in‡ows
and out‡ows is then simply the result of a higher volatility of gross ‡ows relative to net ‡ows.
More precisely, assuming the same variance of in‡ows and out‡ows, so that net and gross ‡ows
are uncorrelated, we have
corr(Outf lows; Inf lows) =

[var(GF )=var(N F )] 1
[var(GF )=var(N F ) + 1

(1)

We then need to explain the increase in the volatility of gross ‡ows relative to the volatility of net
‡ows.
We will argue that …nancial globalization (increased stock of external assets and liabilities)
3

The empirical importance of such a global …nancial cycle for capital ‡ows has been recently questioned by
Cerutti, Claessens and Rose (2017). Gourio et.al. (2016) provide evidence that an increase in global risk reduces
capital in‡ows and out‡ows of emerging markets.
4
Another, very di¤erent, reason for di¤erent portfolio shifts of domestic and foreign agents that lead in‡ows
and out‡ows to be positively correlated is associated with o¢ cial capital ‡ows. When capital in‡ows lead to an
accumulation of reserves, they are combined with o¢ cial out‡ows. We …nd this to be an important contributor to
the correlation between total in‡ows and out‡ows of emerging markets. See also Bianchi, Hatchondo and Martinez
(2016). Yet another explanation is bank liquidity management, suggested by Davis (2015), where banks reduce
out‡ows to manage liquidity when faced with a drop in in‡ows.

raises the volatility of gross ‡ows relative to net ‡ows, while trade globalization (higher imports and
exports) does the opposite. Financial globalization has signi…cantly outpaced trade globalization
in recent decades, which accounts for the higher correlation between in‡ows and out‡ows.
We will con…rm this explanation empirically by considering a sample of 128 countries with
annual data from 1970 to 2011. We show both in cross section and panel data that …nancial
globalization generates a higher correlation between capital in‡ows and out‡ows and a higher
volatility of gross ‡ows relative to net ‡ows. The impact of trade globalization is more ambiguous,
but the evidence points to a decrease in the correlation between capital in‡ows and out‡ows and
a lower volatility of gross ‡ows relative to net ‡ows.
After documenting the empirical evidence, we develop a simple two period, two country model
to shed light on the empirical …ndings. The model contains a wide variety of shocks: income shocks,
expected asset payo¤ shocks, portfolio shocks, saving shocks, investment shocks and trade shocks.
We then consider the impact of …nancial and trade globalization, while keeping the magnitude of
all the shocks in the model unchanged. We do so by varying the parameters in the model that
determine cross-border asset holdings and trade ‡ows, holding all else …xed.
The results in the model are consistent with the data. Financial globalization raises the
volatility of gross ‡ows relative to net ‡ows and therefore raises the correlation between capital
in‡ows and out‡ows, while trade globalization does the opposite. Furthermore, we …nd that
a proportional increase in both trade and …nancial integration still leads to an increase in the
relative volatility of gross ‡ows, and thus an increase in the correlation between in‡ows and
out‡ows. So while the rapid increase in …nancial globalization relative to trade globalization that
has taken place over the past three decades has certainly led to an increased correlation between
in‡ows and out‡ows, an increase in the correlation would have occurred even if trade and …nancial
globalization had progressed at the same pace.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the stylized facts in the
data. Section 3 describes the model. Section 4 discusses the results implied by the model. Section
5 concludes.

Empirical Evidence

In this section we consider the empirical relationship between various capital ‡ow moments and
…nancial and trade globalization. Financial globalization is measured as the sum of external assets
and liabilities divided by GDP, while trade globalization is measured as exports plus imports
divided by GDP. There are 128 countries in the sample, split into groups of 25 advanced economies
and 103 emerging and developing economies. The full list of countries is presented in Table 1.
Capital ‡ow moments are calculated using annual data from 1970 to 2011. Gross capital
in‡ow and out‡ow data, as well as export and import data, are from the IMF’s International
Financial Statistics database. Data for the stock of external assets and liabilities are from Lane
and Milesi-Ferretti (2007), using their data update through 2011.

Descriptive statistics

We will denote OF = outf lows and IF = inf lows. Net out‡ows are N F = OF
IF and
gross ‡ows are GF = OF + IF . Table 2 provides four moments: the correlation between capital
in‡ows and out‡ows, the standard deviations of net and gross capital ‡ows and their ratio. In
the top panel of the table, capital out‡ows and in‡ows in each country are normalized by the
previous year’s sum of external assets and liabilities. In the bottom panel the same capital ‡ows
are normalized by GDP in the previous year.
These statistics are presented for the pre-1990 sub-period (1970-1990) and the post-1990 subperiod (1990-2011) for both the advanced economies and the emerging markets. In addition, since
capital out‡ows include central bank foreign exchange reserve accumulation, the statistics are
presented both when reserve accumulation is included in capital out‡ows and when it is excluded.
Turning …rst to the advanced economy sample, under both normalizations there is a sizable
increase in the correlation between capital out‡ows and in‡ows between the pre- and post-1990
periods. The increase is from 0.25 to 0.87 when scaled by external assets and liabilities, and from
0.41 to 0.91 when scaled by GDP. We know from equation (1), presented in the introduction, that

4

there is a positive monotonic relationship between this correlation and the standard deviation of
gross ‡ows relative to the standard deviation of net ‡ows. Table 2 indeed con…rms that together
with the sharp increase in the correlation between in‡ows and out‡ows there is a large increase in
the standard deviation of gross ‡ows relative to the standard deviation of net ‡ows from the preto post-1990 periods.
The value of Std (GF ) =Std (N F ), as well its change between sub-samples, is similar regardless
of how we normalize capital ‡ows. However, the normalization does a¤ect the standard deviations
of gross and net ‡ows individually. When normalizing by the sum of external assets and liabilities,
the standard deviation of gross ‡ows barely changes between the two sub-samples and there is a
sizable fall in the standard deviation of net ‡ows. When normalizing by GDP, there is little change
in the standard deviation of net ‡ows, but there is a sizable increase in the standard deviation of
gross ‡ows across the two periods.
Emerging markets and developing countries also experienced an increase in the correlation between capital in‡ows and out‡ows across the sub-samples, though both the level of the correlation
and its change are smaller than for advanced economies. The same is the case for the standard
deviation of gross ‡ows relative to the standard deviation of net ‡ows. This is true whether or
not reserve accumulation is included as part of capital out‡ows. O¢ cial reserve accumulation has
virtually no e¤ect on the statistics for advanced economies, but in emerging markets there is a
sizable fall in the standard deviation of gross capital ‡ows, and the correlation between in‡ows and
out‡ows, when reserves are excluded. When capital in‡ows lead to an accumulation of reserves,
capital out‡ows increase as well, as in Bianchi, Hatchondo and Martinez (2016).
A possible explanation for the increase in the correlation between capital in‡ows and out‡ows,
as well as the higher correlation in advanced countries, is the higher degree of …nancial globalization. The bottom of Table 2 shows that between the earlier and later periods the stock of external
assets and liabilities as a share of GDP more than tripled in the advanced economies, whereas it
increased by about 60% in the emerging markets. Both country groups saw a similar, and much
smaller, increase in the level of trade as a share of GDP. This change over time in …nancial and
trade globalization is also illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 compares the two sub-periods for
individual countries, while Figure 2 shows the time series for the average of both sets of countries.
In almost all advanced countries there is a very large increase in external assets and liabilities as
a fraction of GDP, while in most emerging markets the increase is far more modest. At the same
time, the bottom charts of Figure 1 show that most countries in both groups either did not see
an increase in trade or only a modest increase. Figure 2 shows that the average level of trade in
advanced countries closely tracks that of emerging markets since the late 1970s.

Table 3 presents results from multivariate regressions of the capital ‡ow moments on …nancial
and trade globalization. The top panel in the table presents the results from a cross-sectional
regression, where the capital ‡ow moments and averages of the independent variables for each
country are calculated over the entire sample. The bottom panel presents the results from a panel
data regression that uses the capital ‡ow moments and averages of the independent variables for
both the pre-1990 and post-1990 subsamples. The panel regression includes country-…xed e¤ects.
The two regressions ask the same question in slightly di¤erent ways. The cross-sectional
regression asks if across a sample of 128 countries, countries with a higher stock of external assets
and liabilities tend to have more volatile gross capital ‡ows and greater correlation between capital
in‡ows and out‡ows. The panel data regression with country …xed e¤ects instead asks if a change
in …nancial or trade globalization leads to a change in the capital ‡ow moments.

*The table reports coe¢ cients from multivariate regressions of capital ‡ow moments on the stock of external assets and
liabilities, as a share of GDP, and the sum of exports and imports as a share of GDP. The results in the top panel are from a
cross-sectional regression with the moments for each country calculated over the entire sample period and the independent
variables averaged over the sample period. The results in the bottom panel are from a panel data regression with the
moments for each country calculated in the pre-1990 and post-1990 periods and the independent variables averaged over
the pre-1990 and post-1990 periods. Standard errors are in parenthesis. ***/**/* denotes signi…cance at the 1/5/10%
level.

First consider the cross section results. In line with our earlier intuition, …nancial globalization
has a positive and signi…cant e¤ect on both the correlation between out‡ows and in‡ows and the
closely related ratio of the standard deviations of gross ‡ows and net ‡ows. While the positive
impact of …nancial globalization on the ratio of the standard deviations of gross and net ‡ows
is independent of the normalization of capital ‡ows, the impact on the standard deviations of
gross and net ‡ows individually depends signi…cantly on normalization. When capital ‡ows are
normalized by the stock of external assets and liabilities, …nancial globalization has a negative
e¤ect on the standard deviation of net ‡ows and no e¤ect on the standard deviation of gross ‡ows.
When instead capital ‡ows are normalized by GDP, …nancial globalization has no e¤ect on the
9

standard deviation of net ‡ows and a positive e¤ect on the standard deviation of gross ‡ows.
The e¤ect of trade globalization in the cross sectional regressions is a bit more di¢ cult to
discern. Under both normalizations it has a positive e¤ect on the volatility of net capital ‡ows
and lowers the volatility of gross ‡ows relative to the volatility of net ‡ows, though the latter is
only statistically signi…cant when capital ‡ows are normalized by GDP. Trade globalization lowers
the correlation between in‡ows and out‡ows when capital ‡ows are normalized by GDP, but the
result is insigni…cant when normalized by external assets and liabilities. The e¤ect on the volatility
of gross ‡ows also depends a lot on the normalization.
Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2013) argue that a cross-sectional regression can lead to a type of omitted
variable bias. If there is some unobserved third factor that leads to a positive correlation between
trade or …nancial openness and the variance of capital ‡ows in the cross section, omitted variable
bias may occur. This may be a time-invariant gravity variable. Portes and Rey (2005) argue that
the same gravity variables that a¤ect bilateral trade ‡ows also a¤ect …nancial ‡ows. Since this
unobserved third factor is time invariant, we can control for it with a country-…xed e¤ect in a
panel data regression.
The panel regression results are presented in the bottom half of Table 3. The impact of …nancial
globalization remains the same as in the cross section regression. Countries that experienced a
relative large increase in …nancial globalization across the sub-periods saw a larger increase in the
correlation between capital in‡ows and out‡ows. In contrast to the cross section regressions, trade
does not have a signi…cant e¤ect on capital ‡ow moments in the panel regressions. This may be
because the change in trade was not very large across the two sub-periods for most countries, as
shown in the charts at the bottom of Figure 1. The change in …nancial globalization was much
larger and more varied across countries.
Table 4 is analogous to Table 3, but uses the logs of the independent variables. The dependent variable in each regression remains the same. Qualitatively the results are identical to the
earlier results. Table 4 can also be used to consider a proportional change in trade and …nancial
globalization. This implies an equal change in the logs of the …nancial and trade globalization
variables. The coe¢ cients of all regressions in Table 4 imply that proportional globalization raises
the correlation between capital in‡ows and out‡ows and raises the ratio of standard deviations of
gross ‡ows and net ‡ows.

*The table reports coe¢ cients from multivariate regressions of capital ‡ow moments on the log of …nancial and trade
globalization variables. The results in the top panel are from a cross-sectional regression with the moments for each
country calculated over the entire sample period and the independent variables averaged over the sample period. The
results in the bottom panel are from a panel data regression with the moments for each country calculated in the pre-1990
and post-1990 periods and the independent variables averaged over the pre-1990 and post-1990 periods. Standard errors
are in parenthesis. ***/**/* denotes signi…cance at the 1/5/10% level.

We can summarize the results from this section in the form of a couple of stylized facts.
Stylized Fact 1 Financial globalization raises the correlation between capital in‡ows and out‡ows
and raises the standard deviation of gross ‡ows relative to the standard deviation of net ‡ows.
Stylized Fact 2 When capital ‡ows are normalized by external assets and liabilities, …nancial
globalization lowers the volatility of net ‡ows while it does not a¤ect the volatility of gross ‡ows.
When capital ‡ows are normalized by GDP, …nancial globalization has an e¤ect on net ‡ows that
is not statistically signi…cant or small, while it raises the volatility of gross ‡ows.
Stylized Fact 3 The e¤ect of trade globalization is somewhat ambiguous. Results that are statistically signi…cant show that trade globalization lowers the correlation between capital in‡ows and
out‡ows and the ratio of the volatilities of gross ‡ows and net ‡ows.
Stylized Fact 4 Proportional …nancial and trade globalization raises the correlation between capital in‡ows and out‡ows and the ratio of the volatilities of gross ‡ows and net ‡ows.
These results are also consistent with the …ndings from Table 2. They explain the higher
correlation between capital in‡ows and out‡ows of advanced countries, especially in the second
half of the sample. Stylized Fact 2 also explains the dependence on normalization of the changes
in gross and net capital ‡ow volatilities reported in Table 2.

3

The Model

The model aims to shed light on the impact of …nancial and trade globalization on the correlation
between capital in‡ows and out‡ows. The model consists of two countries (Home and Foreign), two
periods, and two types of agents. The agents are native and global investors. Native investors in
both countries only hold domestic assets, while global investors hold globally diversi…ed portfolios.
The extent of …nancial globalization is measured by the relative fraction of the global agents, which
determines the size of external assets and liabilities in the absence of any shocks. The extent of
trade globalization is driven by a home preference parameter in the consumption index of Home
and Foreign goods. The objective will be to investigate how increases in …nancial and trade
globalization a¤ect the volatility of gross and net capital ‡ows in response to various shocks, and
therefore the correlation between capital in‡ows and out‡ows. There will be a total of 14 shocks
(7 types of shocks in both Home and Foreign).

3.1

Production and Investment

There is a Home good and a Foreign good. Output in period i = 1; 2 is equal to productivity
times the capital stock:
YHi = AHi KHi

(2)

YF i = AF i KF i

(3)

In period 1 we assume that the capital stock is K in both countries: KH1 = KF 1 = K. Capital
accumulates due to new investment:
KH2 = K + IH

(4)

KF 2 = K + IF

(5)

There is no depreciation. Productivity is equal to
AHi = Ae"Hi

(6)

AF i = Ae"F i

(7)

where "Hi and "F i are Home and Foreign productivity shocks with mean 0. We will also refer to
"H1 and "F 1 as current income shocks. Changes in the expectations E("H2 ) and E("F 2 ) will be
referred to as expected dividend shocks as they will a¤ect expected asset payo¤s. They are a type
of news shock.
Capital goods are supplied by competitive installment …rms. In the Home country they produce
IH new capital goods in period 1 and sell them to …rms at the price QH . Producing IH capital
goods requires

"H is a Home time discount rate shock, which we will also refer to as a saving shock. A positive
value implies an increase in Home saving. "Hi , i = 1; 2, are preference shocks, which we will also
refer to as trade shocks. A positive value implies a shift towards Foreign goods and therefore an
increase in trade. The equilibrium in period 1 will be a¤ected by both period 1 trade shocks "H1
and expectations of period 2 trade shocks, E("H2 ). The parameter 2 [0:5; 1] captures a bias
towards domestic goods. In the absence of shocks a fraction will be spent on domestic goods.
As we lower from 1 to 0.5, trade increases from zero (autarky) to its maximum level with perfect
goods market integration.

Now consider the consumption and portfolio decisions. There are native investors and global
investors in both countries. Native investors only hold claims on domestic assets, while global
investors optimally diversify across Home and Foreign assets. In each country there are m global
investors and 1 m native investors. The parameter m is critical as it will determine the size of
external assets and liabilities and therefore …nancial globalization.
Parameterizing …nancial globalization this way has the appeal that an increase in m implies
not only larger external …nancial assets and liabilities, but also a larger portfolio response to an
expected return di¤erential between Home and Foreign assets. In models where home bias shows
up additively in portfolios, for example as a result of a cost of investing abroad that lowers the
return, the extent of return arbitrage is independent of the extent of …nancial integration. A
di¤erent approach that delivers the same positive relationship between external claims and return
arbitrage assumes that there is a friction that captures an information asymmetry, implying a
perceived variance of returns that is a factor 1 + larger for foreign agents than domestic agents.
When = 2(1 m)=m, this generates the same equilibrium as in our model.5
At the start of period 1, the native investors hold a fraction 1 m of the domestic capital stock.
Home and Foreign global investors hold the same portfolio at the start of period 1. Both hold a
fraction 0:5m of Home and Foreign capital. The wealth of Home and Foreign native investors in
period 1 is then

(22)

Okawa and van Wincoop (2012) develop a gravity theory of bilateral asset holdings based on such an asymmetric
information framework, with bilateral variation in the friction .

14

The wealth consists of the dividends from the asset claims at the start of period 1 plus the principal
value of the claims plus the pro…ts from the installment …rms. The assumption that the pro…ts
from installment …rms goes to the native investors is just a technicality as it drops out with
linearization.
The wealth of the Home and Foreign global investors is
W = WHg = WFg = 0:5m (PH1 YH1 + PF 1 YF 1 ) + 0:5m(QH + QF )K

(23)

The wealth is the same for Home and Foreign global investors and equal to the dividends and
principal value from the claims of a fraction 0:5m of both Home and Foreign assets.
Global investors make both saving and portfolio decisions, while native investors only make
a saving decision. Native investors receive the domestic return in period 2, RH for Home native
investors and RF for Foreign native investors. Home global investors receive a portfolio return in
period 2 of
Rp;H = zH RH + (1 zH )RF
(24)
where zH is the share invested in Home assets. The portfolio return of Foreign global investors,
Rp;F , is the same, with the portfolio share in Home asset zF .
As a result of log utility, optimal consumption decisions do not depend on expected portfolio
returns. Both Home native and global investors consume a fraction 1=(1 + H ) of their wealth
and save a fraction H =(1 + H ). Aggregate consumption by Home agents in both periods is then

(31)

Using the log linear approximation rp;H = zH rH + (1 zH )rF , de…ning the excess return er =
rH rF , and assuming normality of log returns, we can solve for the optimal portfolio:
zH = 0:5 +

E(er) + "er
H
var(er)

(32)

Analogous for example to Devereux and Engel (2002) and Hau (1998), we assume that the expectation of the excess return is E(er) + "er
H , which is the sum of the rational expectation E(er) and
an expectational error.
We will write "zH = "er
H =var(er), so that
E(er)
+ "zH
var(er)

zH = 0:5 +

(33)

Here "zH is an exogenous portfolio shock. While the portfolio shocks are the result of expectational
errors, we will think of them more broadly as any type of …nancial shocks generating portfolio
shifts. Depending on the speci…cation, this can take the form of liquidity trade, noise trade, timevarying risk (Tille and van Wincoop (2010,2014)), time-varying risk-bearing capacity (Gabaix and
Maggiori (2015)), time-varying costs of investment abroad (Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2017))
or time-varying private investment opportunities (Wang (1994)).6 The speci…cation for Foreign
global investors is analogous:
E(er)
zF = 0:5 +
"zF
(34)
var(er)
An increase in both "zH and "zF then generates a global retrenchment towards domestic assets.
This may be part of a global …nancial cycle as Rey (2013) has suggested. In the absence of any
shocks to the model, zH = zF = 0:5, so both Home and Foreign global investors hold perfectly
diversi…ed portfolios.

These external asset purchases are equal to the value of external positions in period 1 minus the

Itskhoki and Mukhin (2017) argue that such …nancial shocks can explain most puzzles associate with nominal
and real exchange rates.

Shocks

There are a total of 14 shocks, which are listed in Table 5. Ten shocks are current (period 1)
shocks, while four are news shocks in the form of changing expectations of period 2 innovations.
The latter include expected period 2 dividend innovations and trade innovations. For convenience
of the analysis, we will rewrite all shocks as average shocks and relative shocks. For example, we
transform the saving shocks "H and "F into an average saving shock and a relative saving shock:
"

;A

= 0:5("H + "F )

"

;D

= "H

"F

Throughout we will use the superscript A to denote an average across countries and superscript
D to denote the di¤erence (Home minus Foreign variable).

3.5

Solution

There are six market equilibrium equations. After substituting the expressions for consumption,
investment, wealth and portfolio shares into the six market equilibrium conditions, they depend
on six variables: Home and Foreign goods prices in both periods and the Home and Foreign asset

prices in period 1. We log-linearize around the point where there are no shocks. We then take
the averages and di¤erences of the market clearing conditions across countries. We refer to the
average of Home and Foreign market clearing conditions as the global market clearing condition.
We refer to the di¤erence between Home and Foreign market clearing conditions as the relative
market clearing condition.

q = qH qF and q = 0:5(qH + qF ). Because of Walras’ Law, two of the market clearing
conditions are redundant (one per period). We remove the …rst and second period global goods
market clearing condition, which are the same as the global asset market clearing condition.
Correspondingly, we can remove two variables. Since the model only determines relative prices,
A
we normalize the average of the log goods prices in both periods to be to 0: pA
1 = p2 = 0.
This leaves us with four equations in four variables. The equations are (1) the global asset
market clearing condition, (2) the relative asset market clearing condition, (3) the relative period
1 goods market clearing condition and (4) the relative period 2 goods market clearing condition.
The second and third equations have an alternative, intuitive interpretation as well. The current
account (CA), de…ned as the trade account plus net investment income, is identical to both saving
minus investment (S-I) and net capital out‡ows (NF). The second equation (relative asset market
clearing condition) is the exact same equation as S I = N F . The third equation (relative period
1 goods market clearing condition) is the same as CA = S I. Here CA, N F and S I are all
for the Home country.
We leave all algebraic details to the Online Technical Appendix. The global asset market
clearing condition can be used to solve for the average asset price:
qA =

(43)

Intuitively, a positive average current income shock (positive "A
1 ) and a positive average saving
shock (positive " ;A ) both raise global saving and therefore asset demand, which raises the average
asset price. A positive average investment shock (positive "I;A ) raises the global asset supply,
which lowers the average asset price.

Four shocks drive gross ‡ows. The …rst two shocks, " ;A and "A
1 , raise global saving, which raises
gross capital ‡ows through a portfolio growth e¤ect. Without a change in portfolio allocation,
higher saving leads to an increase in demand of both domestic and foreign assets. The third shock,
the average investment shock "I;A , reduces the average asset price q A , which lowers consumption
and therefore also raises global saving. The last shock, "z;A , is a global portfolio shift towards
domestic assets (retrenchment), which reduces gross capital ‡ows. An example of this is a global
increase in risk or risk-aversion that leads to a retrenchment towards domestic assets, as occurred
during the Great Recession (Milesi-Ferretti and Tille (2011)). Using the now popular terminology
introduced by Rey (2013), one can think of "z;A as a shock to the global …nancial cycle.
D
D
Substituting the solution for pD
1 , q and E(p2 ) in the expression (47) for N F gives a solution
for net capital ‡ows. One can think of net capital ‡ows from a portfolio perspective (N F ), a
saving minus investment perspective (S I) or a trade perspective (CA). Relative goods and

19

asset prices will adjust to make sure these are always the same.
Net capital ‡ows depend on 7 shocks. Three shocks originate from the saving/investment side.
An increase in " ;D raises relative Home saving. From a portfolio perspective this leads to net
capital out‡ows by global investors through two channels. The …rst is portfolio growth, where
a fraction of the higher saving by global investors is invested abroad. The second e¤ect is more
indirect and operates through portfolio reallocation. The higher relative saving of Home native
agents raises relative demand for Home assets, which raises q D . The higher relative price of Home
assets lowers the expected excess return on Home assets, which leads to portfolio reallocation to
Foreign assets by global investors.
A positive relative income shock "D
1 also raises relative Home saving, but only of the native
agents. It therefore has no portfolio growth e¤ect on capital ‡ows. The higher relative Home saving
does lead to a rise in q D , which, analogous to the relative saving shock, leads to a reallocation to
Foreign assets by global investors (net out‡ows).
A positive relative Home investment shock "I;D raises the relative supply of Home assets, which
lowers the relative price q D . The lower relative Home asset price raises the expected excess return
on Home assets, which leads to net capital in‡ows associated with portfolio reallocation by global
investors.
Two shocks that a¤ect net capital ‡ows originate from the trade side. A positive "1 ;D implies
a preference shock towards Foreign goods, which leads to a Home trade de…cit. From a portfolio
perspective, the following happens. The preference shock to Foreign goods raises the relative price
of Foreign goods, which raises relative Foreign income and saving of native agents. This raises the
relative demand for Foreign assets, which lowers q D . This raises the expected excess return on
Home assets and generates capital in‡ows through portfolio reallocation by global investors.
A positive E("2 ;D ) implies an expected preference shock towards Foreign goods in the next
period, which raises the expected period 2 relative price of Foreign goods. This raises the expected
relative return on Foreign assets, leading to net capital out‡ows.
Two shocks a¤ecting net capital ‡ows originate directly from the portfolio side. A positive "z;D
implies an exogenous portfolio shift towards Home assets, leading to net capital in‡ows. A rise
in E("D
2 ) raises the expected relative Home dividends, which raises the expected excess return on
Home assets and also generates net capital in‡ows.
;A
Three shocks a¤ect neither in‡ows nor out‡ows. These are E("A
and E("2 ;A ). E("A
2 ), "1
2)
a¤ects portfolio returns, but not excess returns. As a result of the assumed log utility, expected
portfolio returns do not a¤ect the saving decision and therefore do not impact capital ‡ows. "1 ;A
is a global trade home bias shock. It a¤ects the trade volume (exports plus imports), but not net
trade ‡ows or gross capital ‡ows. The same is the case for E("2 ;A ).

Model Implications for Capital Flow Moments

We now discuss the implications of the model for the correlation between capital in‡ows and
out‡ows. It is useful to repeat (1):
corr(IF; OF ) =

[var(GF )=var(N F )] 1
[var(GF )=var(N F ) + 1

(51)

There is therefore a positive relationship between the correlation between in‡ows and out‡ows
and the relative volatility of gross ‡ows and net ‡ows. We will consider the impact of …nancial
and trade globalization on this relative volatility. Since in the absence of shocks external assets
are 0:5mK and imports=exports=(1
)AK, we can measure …nancial and trade globalization
respectively with the parameters m and 1
.
The impact of …nancial globalization on the volatilities of gross and net ‡ows depends on
whether we scale capital ‡ows by external assets (0:5mK), GDP (AK) or we do not scale at all.
However, the impact of both …nancial and trade globalization parameters on the relative volatility
of gross ‡ows and net ‡ows does not depend on scaling. Most of the results will be based on
scaling capital ‡ows by external assets 0:5mK as we will see that this simpli…es the analysis. But
it is important to emphasize that the scaling does not matter for the correlation between in‡ows
and out‡ows.
A priori it is not immediately clear that …nancial globalization would imply a higher correlation
between in‡ows and out‡ows. One might expect that …nancial globalization increases both the
volatility of gross ‡ows and net ‡ows. We …nd that …nancial globalization indeed increases the
volatility of gross ‡ows when divided by GDP, while numerical results show that the impact on
net ‡ows as a fraction of GDP can go both ways. The increased volatility of gross ‡ows always
dominates, but this is a numerical result that does not have an intuitive explanation. We will show
that when instead we divide capital ‡ows by external assets we obtain a clean and intuitive result:
…nancial globalization does not a¤ect the volatility of gross ‡ows, but reduces the volatility of
net ‡ows. It therefore unambiguously raises the correlation between in‡ows and out‡ows. Trade
globalization also does not a¤ect the volatility of gross ‡ows, but raises the volatility of net ‡ows.
It therefore reduces the correlation between in‡ows and out‡ows. In the remainder of this section
we will explicitly derive these results.

When capital ‡ows are scaled by external assets, gross ‡ows do not depend on either the …nancial
globalization parameter m or the trade globalization parameter 1
.
Result 1 When gross ‡ows are scaled by external assets, neither …nancial nor trade globalization
21

a¤ects the volatility of gross ‡ows.
Especially for …nancial globalization, this result is consistent with the empirical analysis in
Section 2 (Stylized Fact 2). Both cross section regressions and panel regressions …nd no e¤ect
of …nancial globalization on the volatility of gross capital ‡ows when scaled by external assets
and liabilities. The results for trade globalization are mixed as there is a positive e¤ect of trade
globalization on the gross capital ‡ow volatility in cross section regressions and no e¤ect in panel
regressions.
The logic behind this result is as follows. Gross ‡ows and gross external holdings both increase
proportional to m. As a fraction of external holdings, gross ‡ows are therefore independent of m.
Consider for example an increase in "z;A . This is a portfolio shock that leads to a global retrenchment towards domestic assets. The retrenchment only applies to global investors in the model and
is therefore proportional to m. The impact of the shock on gross ‡ows is then proportional to m.
Gross external assets and liabilities are also proportional to m as only global investors hold foreign
assets. Gross ‡ows and positions are therefore both proportional to m. This is also consistent
with the …ndings in Tables 3 and 4 that when gross ‡ows are not scaled by external assets (scaled
by GDP) …nancial globalization raises gross ‡ow volatility (Stylized Fact 2). Trade globalization
only a¤ects gross and net trade ‡ows in the model, not gross capital ‡ows. This does not depend
on how we scale capital ‡ows.

4.2

Net Flows: Special Case

Analyzing the impact of globalization on net capital ‡ow volatility is a bit more involved. While
it is possible to derive a closed form analytical solution of net ‡ows as a function of the shocks,
the expression is lengthy and its volatility is a highly non-linear function of both …nancial and
trade globalization parameters. We therefore start with a special case, where Home and Foreign
D
goods are perfect substitutes. This happens when ! = 1. In that case pD
1 = p2 = 0. Imposing
N F = S I, using the expressions (47) and (48) for N F and S I, we can solve
qD =

De…ne = 1 + 4=var(er) and = 1=(1 + ). Writing the denominator of (52) as D(m) and
substituting (52) back into the net capital ‡ow expression (47), we have

The absolute value of the coe¢ cients in front of the shocks clearly declines as m rises. The
numerator of the ratios is either a negative function of m or independent of m, while D(m) in the
denominator depends positively on m. It is therefore unambiguous that net capital ‡ows, scaled
22

by external assets, become less volatile as m rises.
Result 2 In the special case where Home and Foreign goods are perfect substitutes, …nancial
globalization reduces the volatility of net capital ‡ows scaled by external assets.
This result is consistent with Stylized Fact 2. Both the panel and cross section regressions
show that an increase in …nancial globalization reduces the volatility of net capital ‡ows as a share
of external assets in a statistically signi…cant way.
Together with Result 1, the following corollary applies
Corollary 1 When Home and Foreign goods are perfect substitutes, …nancial globalization increases the correlation between capital in‡ows and out‡ows.
No results about trade integration apply in this special case. The parameter plays no role
as Home and Foreign goods are perfect substitutes. Gross trade ‡ows are then indeterminate.
To illustrate Result 2, Figure 3 shows the impact of a portfolio shift towards Foreign assets,
which implies a negative value of "z;D . The same analysis applies when the shift towards Foreign
assets is a result of drop in the expected relative Home dividend (decline in E("D
2 )). Figure 3
shows the N F and S I schedules, both scaled by external assets. Abstracting from the other
shocks, these schedules are

(55)

The net out‡ow schedule is upward sloping as a function of q D . An increase in the relative Home
asset price lowers the expected excess return on Home assets, which leads to net capital out‡ows.
The S I schedule is a downward sloping function of q D . S I is equal to 0:5(S D I D ). A rise
in q D raises relative Home consumption by native investors, which lowers relative Home saving. A
rise in q D also raises relative Home investment through the Tobin’s Q e¤ect. Both reduce S I.
Only the S I schedule depends on m. The S I schedule is ‡atter the larger m. Figure 3
therefore shows the S I schedule for both a low m (steep) and a high m (‡at).
A portfolio shift towards Foreign assets (drop in "z;D ) shifts up the N F schedule, while leaving
the S I schedule unchanged. For a low m the equilibrium is at point B, while for a high m
it is at point C. Scaled by external assets, the response of net out‡ows to the portfolio shock is
therefore smaller under more …nancial globalization.
The portfolio shift towards Foreign assets leads to an increase in the relative price of the Foreign
assets, or a drop in q D . The ultimate response of net capital ‡ows depends on how responsive
saving and investment are to the change in q D . If they were not responsive at all, there will be no
net capital ‡ows. In that case q D drops enough, raising the relative return on the Home assets, to
shift the portfolio allocation all the way back to its starting point. We have already seen that S I
depends negatively on q D , so that a drop in q D leads to net out‡ows. But the e¤ect is dampened
23

Figure 3: Equilibrium after portfolio shift towards foreign assets.

as m is larger, for two reasons. First, a rise in m implies that there are fewer native investors,
which reduces the change in relative saving. Relative wealth and saving of global investors are
una¤ected. Second, both saving and investment are scaled by external assets. A rise in m reduces
the scaled saving and investment. For both of these reasons the net capital out‡ow response as a
share of external assets is dampened as m rises.
It is of interest to also consider what happens to net capital out‡ows if we do not scale by
external assets. There are now two opposing forces. First, the N F schedule will shift up more for
a higher m. The portfolio shock is larger when there are more global investors that change their
portfolio. This by itself implies that …nancial globalization increases net capital ‡ows. On the
other hand, more global investors also implies that there is more return arbitrage. More investors
change portfolios in response to a change in the expected return di¤erence. A smaller change in
q D is needed to clear markets. This e¤ect, which corresponds to a steeper N F schedule, leads
…nancial globalization to dampen net capital ‡ows.7 Numerically we …nd that net capital out‡ows
…rst increase and then drop in size as we keep raising m from 0 to 1. This is consistent with the
mixed results in Tables 3 and 4, where the e¤ect of …nancial globalization on the volatility of net
‡ows relative to GDP is insigni…cant or positive and small (Stylized Fact 2).
7

It also remains the case that a higher m implies a smaller relative saving response as only relative saving of
native investors changes with q D . This dampens the e¤ect of …nancial globalization on net capital ‡ows.

24

The standard deviation of gross ‡ows increases proportionately with m when capital ‡ows are
not scaled by external assets. Even if the volatility of net capital ‡ows increases with m, the ratio
of the volatilities of gross and net ‡ows will still be dominated by the increased volatility if gross
‡ows. But this is not an obvious result. Scaling by external assets makes it much more transparent
that the volatility of gross ‡ows rises relative to the volatility of net ‡ows as m increases, generating
a higher correlation between in‡ows and out‡ows.

4.3

Net Capital Flows: The General Case

We …nally consider the general case where ! is …nite, so that Home and Foreign goods are imperfect
substitutes. In that case we need to solve for relative goods prices as well and it is hard to get clean
analytical results. We therefore illustrate the impact of the various shocks on net capital ‡ows
through a numerical illustration. The drawback of this is that we need to pick speci…c parameters.
But we …nd that the parameter values have little qualitative e¤ect on the results.
Figures 4 through 7 report the results. We set = 0:95, ! = 2, = 2:5 and var(er) = 0:04.8
When varying the degree of …nancial globalization with the parameter m, we hold = 0:86. When
varying the degree of trade integration, we hold m = 0:2.
Figure 4 reports the impact of shocks on net capital ‡ows scaled by external assets when
varying m from 0 to 1. The shocks are normalized to 1 or -1, with the sign such that the response
of net capital ‡ows is positive. Figure 4 shows that for all shocks an increase in m reduces the
size of net capital ‡ows scaled by external assets.9 The numerical analysis implies the following
…nding.
Result 3 When Home and Foreign goods are imperfect substitutes, numerical analysis implies
that an increase in …nancial globalization reduces the impact of shocks on net capital ‡ows scaled
by external assets. Financial globalization therefore reduces the volatility of net capital ‡ows as a
fraction of external assets.
Thus the results for the special case where goods are perfect substitutes in section 4.2 generalizes to the case where goods are imperfect substitutes.
Figure 5 shows that a very di¤erent picture emerges when net out‡ows are scaled by GDP.
In some cases the size of net out‡ows increases monotonically with the …nancial globalization
parameter m. In others it …rst increases and then decreases with m. These results are not
inconsistent with the ambiguous e¤ect of …nancial globalization on the volatility of net capital
‡ows as a share of GDP found in the data when globalization increases (Stylized Fact 2).
Figure 6 shows the impact of trade globalization. De…ne T rade as exports or imports in the
absence of shocks. As we vary from 1 to 0.5, T rade=GDP (on the horizontal axis) changes

The variance of the excess return is endogenous, but we can always set the standard deviations of the shocks
to match any variance of the excess return.
9
The only small footnote to this is that for a relative income shock the net out‡ow response turns slightly
negative for large enough m. This is because a positive Home productivity shock leads to negative net investment
income, which makes the current account slightly negative.

25

from 0 to 0.5. In all cases net out‡ows increase as we increase trade globalization.10 The following
result applies.
Result 4 When Home and Foreign goods are imperfect substitutes, numerical analysis implies
that an increase in trade globalization increases the impact of shocks on net capital ‡ows, therefore
increasing the volatility of net capital ‡ows.
In the case of trade globalization, it does not matter for the theory whether we scale by external
assets or GDP as neither depend on .
Since we have already established that neither …nancial nor trade globalization a¤ect the
volatility of gross capital ‡ows as a share of external assets, the following corollary applies (subject
to minor quali…cations noted above).
Corollary 2 When Home and Foreign goods are imperfect substitutes, …nancial globalization increases the correlation between capital in‡ows and out‡ows, while trade globalization decreases the
correlation between capital in‡ows and out‡ows.
As a …nal exercise we consider the theoretical impact of jointly increasing …nancial and trade
globalization. For this purpose we vary m from 0 to 1, while setting 1
= 0:5m. This leads to
a gradual change from …nancial and trade autarky to perfect integration along both dimensions.
The …nancial and trade globalization measures stay in a constant ratio. Figure 7 reports the
results, with net capital ‡ows scaled by external assets. For all shocks net capital ‡ows decline
with the joint globalization. Since neither …nancial not trade globalization a¤ects the volatility of
gross capital ‡ows, the following result applies.
Result 5 When Home and Foreign goods are imperfect substitutes, numerical analysis implies that
a proportional joint increase in trade and …nancial globalization increases the correlation between
capital in‡ows and out‡ows.
While we have seen that …nancial and trade globalization have an opposite e¤ect on the correlation between in‡ows and out‡ows, this result says that …nancial globalization has a larger e¤ect
when they are changed proportionately. This is consistent with Stylized Fact 4 from the empirical
analysis. Of course in the data the globalization has been highly skewed towards …nancial globalization. As our results have shown, this further reinforces the increase in the correlation between
capital in‡ows and out‡ows.

10

There is again a small footnote with regards to relative income shocks, where the impact on net out‡ows
starts slightly negative at trade levels near zero before it turns positive. This is again associated with negative net
investment income.

Conclusion

We have aimed to explain the rapidly increasing correlation between capital in‡ows and out‡ows
seen in the data and the much higher correlation in more advanced countries. Both empirical
evidence and theory point to a clear culprit, the increased level of …nancial globalization measured by the increased stock of external assets and liabilities. Trade globalization has the exact
opposite e¤ect, but has been signi…cantly dominated by …nancial globalization in the last several decades. Even if trade and …nancial globalization had grown proportionally, we …nd that
the higher correlation between in‡ows and out‡ows due to …nancial globalization would still have
dominated.
A natural direction for future work is to extend the theoretical framework developed here
to a multi-country setup with countries varying in terms of their extent of …nancial and trade
integration, their size, and the magnitude of country-speci…c shocks. This will allow us to consider
additional stylized facts, such as the co-movement of capital ‡ows across countries (global …nancial
cycle) and the correlation between bilateral in‡ows and out‡ows.
