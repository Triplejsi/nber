What Information Drives Asset Prices?

ABSTRACT
The market price-dividend ratio is highly correlated with several macroeconomic variables,
particularly inflation and labor market variables, but not with aggregate consumption and GDP.
We incorporate this observation in an exchange economy with learning about the economic
regime from consumption history and a latent signal. The estimated model rationalizes the
moments of consumption and dividend growth, market return, price-dividend ratio, and real and
nominal term structures and the low predictive power of the price-dividend ratio for consumption
and dividend growth while a nested model with learning from consumption history alone does
not. The intuition is that the beliefs process has high persistence and low variance because beliefs
depend on the signal. The model fit remains largely intact when we replace the latent signal with
a combination of macroeconomic variables that heavily loads on inflation and labor market
variables. The results highlight the informational role of macroeconomic variables and suggest
that just one combination of macroeconomic variables, along with consumption, proxies well for
investors’ relevant information set.

1 Introduction
An overload of worldwide macroeconomic, business, and political news inundates investors. Little
is known as to how investors cope with this vast amount of information, and, in particular, which
subset of information they pay attention to. In the macro-finance literature, researchers typically
model investors as focusing on the histories of a limited number of macroeconomic variables and
applying a filter to rationally extract relevant information about the economy. Prominent examples
include regime-switching models where the regimes are latent and investors filter their beliefs
about the current economic regime from the history of aggregate consumption and GDP alone.
These models fare poorly in explaining several features of stock market data, including the high
equity premium, low risk free rate, high variability of the price-dividend ratio, and low
predictability of consumption and dividend growth by the price-dividend ratio.
Recent literature argues that a more challenging high-dimensional learning problem
confronts investors, where they need to learn not only about the current state but also about the
true underlying model and its parameters, and that such a learning problem plays an important role
in enhancing the empirical performance of these models. While parameter and model uncertainty
are undoubtedly important issues, in this paper we question the other central assumption of
learning models, namely that investors form their beliefs about the economic state from
consumption and GDP histories alone. We show that expanding the information set of investors to
include macroeconomic variables in addition to consumption and GDP plays a central role in
improving the performance of this class of models.
We highlight the advantages of our framework over standard learning models where
investors are assumed to learn from consumption and GDP histories alone; long run risks models;
2

and models with parameter and model uncertainty in addition to state uncertainty. We also discuss
the importance of identifying the information set of investors for other applications, in addition to
the application considered in this paper. Reliable identification of the information set of investors
is important for a host of other applications. For example, conditional moments (e.g., means and
variances) of returns are often modeled as projections onto a set of predetermined conditioning
variables. Econometric considerations necessitate the choice of a small set of variables,
introducing an element of arbitrariness in the modeling of expectations and may produce
misleading estimates (see, e.g., Hansen and Richard (1987)). Therefore, if at all possible,
summarizing the investors’ information set with a small-dimensional set of variables is quite
useful. Also recent research highlights how investors’ subjective beliefs, or belief distortions
relative to the rational expectations benchmark, can be extracted from observed asset prices via
the Euler equations of consumption (see, e.g., Hansen, Hansen, and Mykland (2016)). Once again
the econometric feasibility of this extraction crucially relies on being able to characterize the
conditioning set underlying the Euler equations with a small number of variables. Our paper
contributes towards identifying the investors’ information set. Our paper suggests that just one
macroeconomic variable—a linear combination (the second principal component (2nd PC)) of over
a hundred macroeconomic variables that loads heavily on inflation and labor market variables—
along with consumption growth goes a long way towards proxying for investors’ relevant
information set.
We find that the broad category of macroeconomic information that is most highly
correlated with the market-wide price-dividend ratio consists of inflation variables, including the
rate of change in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U). Labor market
variables, including the change in average hourly earnings and average hours of production in
3

private non-farm payrolls in different sectors, constitute the second category of macroeconomic
variables most correlated with the price-dividend ratio. These are also the two classes of
macroeconomic variables that, according to FactSet, Bloomberg users pay the most attention to
(see, Ai and Bansal (2016)). However, there is some variability in the correlations between the
price-dividend ratio and these macroeconomic variables across subperiods, with the correlations
flipping signs in certain subperiods. This is because CPI-U growth and growth in earnings per hour
can be unreliable univariate signals regarding expectations of economic growth and the resulting
price-dividend ratio. Expectations of high economic growth lead to wage pressure and inflation
depending on productivity growth, tightness of the labor supply, and the ability of firms to automate
production, push employees to work longer hours and harder, or outsource work to foreign
contractors.
To the contrary, we find that the 2nd PC extracted from a broad cross section of over a
hundred macroeconomic variables (that loads most heavily on inflation and labor market variables)
has consistently high positive correlation with the price-dividend ratio in all subsamples.
Moreover, the high correlation also obtains out-of-sample. It appears that the 2nd PC blends signals
from inflation, the labor market, and other macroeconomic variables in a way that captures the
economic conditions under which expectations of high economic growth lead to wage pressure
and inflation.
On the other hand, the price-dividend ratio has negligible correlation with the
contemporaneous consumption and GDP growth as well as moving averages of current and lagged
growth rates. This is contrary to the implications of learning from consumption and GDP histories
alone where investors’ beliefs and, therefore, equilibrium asset prices are functions of the
consumption and GDP histories alone.
4

These features of the data suggest that the poor empirical performance of standard learning
models may be driven, at least in part, by the stringent assumption of learning from the
consumption and GDP histories alone. Therefore, in this paper, we consider a learning process
where investors learn not only from the history of consumption but also from a latent signal. To
shed light on the potential sources of the signal, we set the signal equal to judiciously chosen
macroeconomic variables: a combination of macroeconomic variables (2nd PC) highly correlated
with the price-dividend ratio, or CPI-U growth, or change in earnings per hour.
We consider a representative-investor real exchange economy as in Lucas (1978). We
isolate the role of broadening the investors’ information set by abstracting from model and
parameter uncertainty and assuming that investors know the economic model and its parameters.
The aggregate consumption and stock market dividend processes have different means in two
latent economic regimes. Each period the investors rationally update the probability that the
economy is in the first regime—their beliefs—by observing the updated history of aggregate
consumption and an unspecified signal with innovations orthogonal to those of aggregate
consumption and dividend growth. The signal is deliberately left unspecified at first in order to
demonstrate that there exist potential signals over and above aggregate consumption, the
commonly assumed signal in the literature. The investors are assumed to have recursive
preferences as in Epstein and Zin (1989) and Weil (1990). We numerically solve for the
equilibrium stock market price-dividend ratio, the conditional mean, volatility, and Sharpe ratio of
the market return, and the risk free rate as functions of the investors’ beliefs. We estimate the
model parameters using the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). The model provides a good
fit to the sample moments of consumption growth and dividend growth, market return, market-wide
price-dividend ratio, and risk free rate.
5

In contrast we show that an alternative nested model in which the investors learn from
consumption history alone fails along a number of dimensions. It implies essentially zero volatility
of the price-dividend ratio, grossly at odds with its sample counterpart of 0.46. It, therefore, equates
the volatility of the market return with that of the dividend growth thereby failing to explain the excess
volatility puzzle. The model-implied autocorrelation of the price-dividend ratio is only 0.21, at odds
with the autocorrelation of 0.86 observed in the data. Thus the model fails to generate the high
persistence in the market-wide price-dividend ratio—one of the most robust features observed in the
data. The model implies much higher correlation between consumption growth rate and the
innovation in the risk-free rate than that observed in the data (0.47 versus -0.01). Finally, since the
model-implied price-dividend ratio is essentially constant, the model counterfactually implies a procyclical expected market return (driven by pro-cyclical expected dividend growth) and flat conditional
volatility of the market return.
We provide further evidence in support of the main model by setting the, so far, latent
signal equal to the 2nd PC of the macroeconomic variables. We find that the main model retains its
good empirical fit compared to the case when the signal is left unspecified. In fact, not only does
the model fare much better than the alternative model at matching the unconditional moments of asset
prices and returns, it also generates a time series of the price-dividend ratio that lines up much more
closely with the historical time series compared to the alternative model. In particular, in the main
model, the implied time series of the price-dividend ratio has correlation 0.77 with the historical time
series when the signal is set equal to the 2nd PC of the macro variables and correlation 0.73 with the
historical time series when the signal is set equal to the innovation in the CPI-U. In contrast the
alternative model generates a time series of the price-dividend ratio that has correlation close to zero
with the historical series. These results provide strong support for the economic mechanism
6

highlighted in the main model. However, we stress that the 2nd PC, CPI-U growth, and change in
earnings per hour considered here are only intended as illustrations of our central insight regarding
the pivotal role of the information set and that we do not claim that investors solely learn from
these variables, in addition to consumption.
The success of the main model is a particularly strong result because it derives solely from
expanding the information set of investors to include variables in addition to the history of
consumption. The question, therefore, arises as to what drives the superior performance of the
main model. The crux of the intuition lies in the contrast between the properties of the state and
beliefs processes in the two models. In the main model the state and the beliefs processes have
high persistence and low variance while in the alternative model these processes have low
persistence and high variance. In the main model the high persistence of the state process imparts
high persistence in the investors’ beliefs and renders the price-dividend ratio highly persistent,
consistent with the data. The current beliefs are also highly informative about the future and,
therefore, the price-dividend ratio is highly responsive to changes in beliefs. This feature of the
learning process explains why the price-dividend ratio is highly variable in this model, consistent
with the data. Furthermore, the high persistence in the beliefs process, combined with preference
for early resolution of uncertainty, yields a high equity premium and low risk free rate, consistent
with the data.
In the alternative model, on the other hand, beliefs are less persistent and, therefore, current
beliefs generally provide little information about the future and this leads to the counterfactual
predictions that the price-dividend ratio is essentially constant and the volatility of the market
return equals the volatility of aggregate dividend growth. If the state process and, therefore, the
beliefs process were highly persistent, then the mean consumption growth would be very different
7

in the two states, thereby imparting a counterfactually high volatility in the consumption growth
process.
Also consistent with the data, the main model generates strong time-variation in the
conditional mean and variance of the market return. Perhaps more impressive is the observation
that it does so without relying on heteroscedasticity of the consumption growth rate or the
additional macro signal (the volatilities of consumption growth and the signal are set equal in the
two states)—a phenomenon for which there is limited empirical evidence. Instead the model
generates time-variation in the conditional moments of the market return from the
heteroscedasticity of the beliefs process. In contrast the long-run risks model of Bansal and Yaron
(2004) critically relies on the heteroscedasticity of consumption growth in order to generate timevariation in the equity premium. Moreover, Constantinides and Ghosh (2011) argue that, contrary
to the model’s implications, the conditional variance of expected consumption growth is fairly flat
and fails to capture the large time variation in the equity premium observed in the data.
We further assess the empirical plausibility of the main model with predictive regressions
for consumption growth, dividend growth and market return. For the main model the predictive
2

regressions yield slope coefficients and R that are consistent with the data. In particular the model
generates the low predictive power of the price-dividend ratio for the one-year-ahead as well as
long-horizon consumption and dividend growth rates, consistent with the data. This also contrasts
with the long-run risks model that implies an order of magnitude higher R

2

in forecasting

regressions of the one-year- and three-year-ahead consumption growth rates and three orders of
2

magnitude higher R in a forecasting regression of the five-year-ahead consumption growth rate
2

on the price-dividend ratio; and an order of magnitude higher R in forecasting regressions of the

8

one-year-, three-year-, and five-year-ahead dividend growth rates. The superior performance of the
main model is rendered possible because it does not rely on the persistence of consumption and
dividend growth to generate key asset pricing results, relying instead on the persistence of other
macro variables in the information set of investors.
Finally we compare the average nominal and real yields on Treasury bonds with their
model-implied counterparts. This is a challenging test because real yields beyond one year and
nominal yields of any maturity are not targeted in the estimation of the model parameters. For all
maturities the model-implied nominal yields closely match the data. Also for all maturities the
model-implied real yields closely match the data, a feat that eludes many alternative models.
Note that much of the existing asset pricing literature relies on latent and hard-to-measure
state variables (slow moving expected consumption growth in long run risks models, consumption
habits in habit formation models, and expected size and frequency of disasters in rare-disaster
models). Our paper represents an advance in this regard in that it proposes that investors learn about
the state of the economy from information proxied by observable macroeconomic variables and
demonstrates that the model performance fares favorably relative to these alternative paradigms.
The paper draws on several strands of the literature. It draws on the extant literature that
focuses on learning about latent states or a single parameter as in Ai (2010), Ai and Bansal (2016),
Bansal and Shaliastovich (2011), Croce, Lettau, and Ludvigson (2015), Drechsler (2013), Li
(2005), Lettau, Ludvigson, and Wachter (2008), Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp (2006)), and
Veronesi (2000). Pastor and Veronesi (2009) review learning models. Several papers highlight
learning from macroeconomic variables. Andrei, Hasler, and Jeanneretz (2016) study learning
from macroeconomic variables about the persistence of expected economic growth rather than
about its level. Basak (2005) surveys the literature on learning by agents with heterogeneous
9

beliefs. D’Acundo, Hoang, and Weber (2016) study announcements of future increases in
consumption taxes to generate inflation expectations and accelerate consumption expenditure.
David and Veronesi (2013) study learning from inflation shocks and address the changing sign of
the correlation between stock and bond returns which depends on economic conditions.
Gurkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2005) argue that investors adjust their expectations of the longrun level of inflation in response to macroeconomic and monetary policy surprises. Finally Hall
(2014) examines learning from unemployment and addresses discount rates.
The paper also draws on the empirical evidence in Albuquerque, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo
(2016), Duffee (2005), Greenwald, Lettau, and Ludvigson (2015), and Lettau and Ludvigson
(2013) that the correlation between the stock market return and aggregate consumption growth is
weak.
The paper relates to models of ambiguity by Collin-Dufresne, Johannes, and Lochstoer
(2016), Epstein and Schneider (2003), Hansen and Sargent (2001), Johannes, Lochstoer, and Mou
(2016), Klibanoff, Marinacci, and Mukerji (2005), and Maccheroni, Marinacci, and Rustichini
(2006). Specifically, Collin-Dufresne, Johannes, and Lochstoer (2016) and Johannes, Lochstoer,
and Mou (2016) argue that introducing a high-dimensional learning problem where the investors
need to learn not only about the latent state(s), but also about the true underlying model and its
parameters, plays an important role in enhancing the empirical performance of these models.
Johannes, Lochstoer, and Mou (2016) assume that investors learn either from consumption history
alone or from a combination of consumption and GDP histories. In all cases their model overstates
the mean risk free rate by a factor of two and understates the volatility of the market-wide pricedividend ratio. Our paper, on the other hand, abstracts from parameter and model uncertainty while
expanding the information set of the investors to accommodate learning from judiciously chosen
10

macroeconomic variables, in addition to consumption growth. Our results suggest that this simple
modification to the investors’ information set greatly improves the empirical performance of the
model.
Finally the paper draws on the long-run risks literature by Bansal and Yaron (2004) and
Hansen, Heaton, and Li (2008) who argue for the presence of a small predictable component in
aggregate consumption and dividend growth. Note that our model also implies the presence of a
predictable component in aggregate consumption and dividend growth. Beeler and Campbell
(2012) and Constantinides and Ghosh (2011) point out that long-run risks models imply too high
autocorrelations of the aggregate consumption and dividend growth rate and, therefore, excessive
predictability of consumption and dividend growth by the price-dividend ratio. By contrast our
main model implies autocorrelation functions for consumption and dividend growth that are close
to zero at all lags, consistent with the data. This is rendered possible because in our model, although
consumption growth is not highly persistent, the additional signal is and this enables the investors
to learn about the current economic state as well as forecast the future based on the history of the
signal.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the main model
and derive its pricing implications. We discuss the data in Section 3. The empirical methodology
and estimation results are presented in Section 4, along with a comparison between the main model
and the alternative one. In Section 5 we launch a systematic investigation of the sources of
macroeconomic information that drive aggregate prices. In Section 6 we provide further evidence
in support of the main model by setting the signal equal to the 2nd PC of the macroeconomic
variables or macroeconomic variables highly correlated with the market-wide price-dividend ratio.
In Section 7 we discuss the economic intuition underlying the results. In Section 8 we present the
11

model implications on the real and nominal term structures. We conclude in Section 9. In the
appendix we address the robustness of the results to estimation with quarterly data.

The Model and Solution

2.1

Model Description

We consider a representative-investor real exchange economy. The aggregate consumption and
dividend processes are exogenously specified with their parameters estimated from the data. We
assume that the investors know the economic model and its parameters. We model the aggregate
consumption and dividend growth rates as having different means across two latent regimes,

st = 1, 2 , as
∆ct +1= µc , st +1 + σ cε c ,t +1

(1)

∆dt +1= µ d , st +1 + σ d ε d ,t +1

(2)

and

where ct and dt are the logarithms of aggregate consumption and stock market dividend,
respectively, in period t. The volatilities of consumption growth, σ c , and dividend growth, σ d ,
are assumed to be constant across the two regimes. Our modeling choice of constant volatility of
consumption and dividend growth in the two states is primarily made to highlight that our key
results obtain even in the absence of such heteroscedasticity for which there is limited empirical
evidence. The shocks ε c,t +1 and ε d ,t +1 are i.i.d. standard normal with cross-correlation ρ .
We assume that st is an exogenous Markov process with transition probability matrix
12

 π1 1 − π 2 
,
1 − π
π 2 


(3)

where π i ≡ prob ( st =
i | st −1 =
i ) and 0 < π i < 1 for i = 1,2 . The parameters are estimated from the
data. The unconditional probability of st = 1 is (1 − π 2 ) / ( 2 − π 1 − π 2 ) and its expected duration is

(1 − π 1 )

−1

years. In the empirical section we interpret the state st = 1 as the state of economic

expansion and the state st = 2 as the state of slow economic growth.
We assume that investors do not observe the regime at time t but learn from a history of
signals,  ( t ) . We assume that the investors’ history of signals is  ( t ) = {cτ , xτ }τ = −∞ ,...,t , where xt
is a scalar reflecting additional variables over [t − 1, t ] that investors rely on to form beliefs about
the economic regime at time t.
Most of the existing literature typically assumes that the investors’ history of signals is
simply the consumption history,  ( t ) = {cτ }τ = −∞ ,...,t . These models fare poorly in explaining the
high observed level of the equity premium, the low level of the risk free rate, and the excess
volatility of asset prices relative to fundamentals. The crux of our model lies in allowing investors
to form their beliefs not only from the history of consumption but also from other publicly available
macroeconomic variables—a natural modeling choice given the multitude of publicly available
information—and exploring the resulting improvement in the empirical performance of the model.
The case where the investors’ history of signals is the consumption history alone,
 ( t ) = {cτ }τ = −∞ ,...,t , leads to poor results for two reasons. First consumption growth is not very

persistent. As we shall see in Sections 6 and 7 it is important that the signal be persistent. Second
consumption growth is poorly correlated with the market-wide price-dividend ratio—a regression
13

of the price-dividend ratio on the contemporaneous consumption growth produces a statistically
2

insignificant slope coefficient and R = 1.7% . Moreover the 𝑅𝑅 2 remains small when the

contemporaneous consumption growth is replaced with a moving average of current and lagged

growth rates—the inclusion of five and ten lags produce 𝑅𝑅 2 of 0.72% and 0.05%, respectively. As

we show in Section 5 these are substantially smaller than those obtained with some other macro
variables such as inflation variables.
We assume that the scalar signal xt +1 has constant volatility but different mean across the
two regimes as
=
xt +1 µ x , st +1 + σε x ,t +1 ,

(4)

where ε x ,t +1 is i.i.d. standard normal and orthogonal to ε c ,t +1 and ε d ,t +1 . Without loss of generality
we set µ x ,1 = 0 and σ = 1 . Furthermore we simplify the notation by denoting µ x ,2 by µ .
We denote the mean of the vector ut +1 =

i,=
i 1, 2 , as µi
[ ∆ct +1 , xt +1 ] , conditional on st=
+1

and the variance-covariance matrix as Σ , where

The investors assign probability pt that the economy is in the first regime at date t:

Our model nests the version typically assumed in the literature where investors learn from

main model, featuring learning from both consumption growth and signal histories, and the
alternative model, featuring learning from consumption history alone. Note that the main model
has just one additional parameter, µ , compared to the alternative model.

Model Solution

We solve the model numerically with value function iteration. The obtained highly nonlinear
solutions for the equilibrium wealth-consumption and price-dividend ratios and the conditional
mean and volatility of the market return highlight the importance of eschewing the Campbell and
Shiller (1988) log-linearization or any other form of approximation in solving the model.
We numerically calculate the wealth-consumption ratio, z ( pt ) ≡ Pt / Ct , as a function of

We calculate the unconditional mean, variance, and auto-correlation of the risk free rate and the

We follow a similar procedure to numerically calculate the equilibrium price-dividend
ratio, zM ( pt ) , and, therefore, the unconditional mean, variance, and auto-correlation of the pricedividend ratio, the correlation of the price-dividend ratio and consumption growth, and the
unconditional mean, variance, and auto-correlation of the market return. Finally we obtain the

Description of the Data

For our main empirical results, we use US annual data over the entire available sample period from
1929 to 2013. The starting date of 1929 is dictated by the availability of annual data on per capita
consumption of non-durables and services. The asset menu consists of the market return and the risk
free rate. Our market proxy is the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) value-weighted index
of all stocks on the NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ. The proxy for the real risk free rate is obtained
as follows: the quarterly nominal yield on three-month Treasury bills is deflated using the realized
growth in the Consumer Price Index to obtain the ex-post real three-month Treasury-bill rate. The ex19

ante quarterly risk free rate is then obtained as the fitted value from the regression of the ex-post
three-month Treasury-bill rate on the three-month nominal yield and the realized growth in the
Consumer Price Index over the previous year. The ex-ante quarterly risk free rate at the beginning of
the year is annualized to obtain the ex-ante annual risk free rate. The equity premium is the difference
in average log returns on the market and the risk free rate.
Also used in the empirical analysis are the price-dividend ratio and dividend growth rate of the
market portfolio. These two time-series are computed using the monthly returns with and without
dividends on the market portfolio obtained from the CRSP files. The monthly dividend payments
within a year are added to obtain the annual aggregate dividend, i.e., we do not reinvest dividends either
in T-bills or in the stock market. The annual price-dividend ratio is computed as the ratio of the price
at the end of each calendar year to the annual aggregate dividends paid out during that year.
We obtain annual yields on Treasury bonds from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
website. Nominal yields on one-year, three-year, five-year, and ten-year nominal bonds are
available from 1962 to 2013; on two-year bonds from 1976 to 2013; on seven-year bonds from
1969 to 2013; and on 30-year bonds from 1977 to 2013, with intermission from 2003 to 2005. As
the empirical counterpart to real risk free bonds, yields on five-year, seven-year, and ten-year
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) are available from 2003 to 2013, and on 20-year
TIPS from 2004 to 2013.
The consumption data consists of the per capita personal consumption expenditure on
nondurable goods and services obtained from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. All nominal quantities
are converted to real, using the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
We obtain panel data over 1964-2011 on 106 macroeconomic variables from Sydney
Ludvigson’s web site, based on the Global Insights Basic Economics Database and The
20

Conference Board’s Indicators Database. The variables cover six broad categories of
macroeconomic data: output, labor market, housing sector, orders and inventories, money and
credit, and price levels. We refer the reader to Ludvigson’s website for a detailed description of
these variables. Many of the macroeconomic time series are revised ex post. Gilbert (2011) argues
that the market understands the subsequent revisions but revisions still matter.

Estimation Methodology and Preliminary Results

4.1

Estimation Methodology

The main model has thirteen parameters: two parameters of the regime transition matrix ( π 1 and

π 2 ); one parameter of the signal distribution ( µ ); seven parameters of the time-series processes of
aggregate consumption and dividend growth ( µc ,1, µc ,2 , µd ,1, µd ,1,σ c ,σ d , ρ ); and three preference
parameters ( δ , γ and ψ ). We estimate the parameters using GMM to match the following eighteen
sample moments: the unconditional mean, variance, and first-order autocorrelation of consumption
growth, dividend growth, market return, market-wide price-dividend ratio, and risk free rate; the
correlation between consumption and dividend growth rates; the correlation between the
consumption growth rate and the price-dividend ratio; and the correlation between the dividend
growth rate and the price-dividend ratio. Therefore, we have an over-identified system of eighteen
moment restrictions and thirteen parameters.

4.2

Estimation Results for the Main Model
(Learning from consumption and an unspecified signal)

We first demonstrate that investors learn from signals over and above the consumption history by
introducing an unspecified signal with unconstrained informativeness. The estimation results are
presented in Table 1.
[Table 1 here]
In the first two panels of Table 1 we display the sample moments and the model-generated
moments of the consumption and dividend growth rates, market return, risk free rate, and marketwide price-dividend ratio. In the “Data” row we report the moments computed from the data along
with standard errors (Newey-West (1987) corrected using two lags) in parentheses. In the “Model”
row we present the model-generated moments along with the 95% confidence intervals in square
brackets. The model-generated moments are calculated analytically whenever analytical solutions are
available and from a single long simulation of length one million otherwise. The 95% confidence
intervals are obtained from 10,000 simulations of eighty-four years each, the same size as the historical
sample.
The model matches reasonably well the mean consumption growth (0.014 versus 0.019) and
the volatility of consumption growth (0.030 versus 0.022) but grossly underestimates the first-order
autocorrelation of consumption growth (0.018 versus 0.475). However the model-implied second-,
third-, and fifth-order autocorrelations are 0.018, 0.017, and 0.016, respectively, in closer
agreement with the corresponding data-implied autocorrelations of 0.18, -0.06, and -0.009,
respectively. Models that match precisely the observed first-order autocorrelation of consumption
growth typically substantially overestimate the higher-order autocorrelations. Moreover it has

22

been argued in the literature that the high first-order autocorrelation is potentially an artifact driven
by measurement error and temporal aggregation. This view is further supported by the following
two observations. First the first-order autocorrelation of consumption growth is quite sensitive to
the precise sample period and the measure of consumption used. It takes the value 0.48 over the
1929 to 2013 sample period when nondurables and services consumption is used as the measure
of consumption expenditures, while it is close to zero (-0.06) over the longer 1890 to 2009 period
where total consumption is the measure of consumption expenditures. Second if we were to take
at face value the first-order autocorrelation of consumption growth in the 1929 to 2013 sample
(0.48), we would conclude that consumption growth is an informative signal. In Section 4.3 we reestimate the model when the investors learn from the consumption history alone and find that this
alternative model performs poorly.
The unconditional mean, volatility, and first-order autocorrelation for the dividend growth
rate are 0.012, 0.113, and 0.183, respectively, in the data and 0.019, 0.154, and 0.049, respectively, in
the model. The model does a good job in matching the mean but overestimates the volatility and
underestimates the autocorrelation, possibly due to dividend smoothing. The model-implied second-,
third-, and fifth-order autocorrelations are close to zero at 0.047, 0.045, and 0.042, respectively,
consistent with the data-implied autocorrelations of -0.197, -0.176, and -0.004, respectively.
The model-implied correlation between consumption and dividend growth is 0.51, in close
agreement with its sample counterpart of 0.57. Consumption and dividend growth have low
correlations with the price-dividend ratio in the data (0.14 and 0.11, respectively). The
corresponding model-implied correlations are close to their data values at 0.14 and 0.22,
respectively. The model sets the autocorrelations of consumption and dividend growth close to

23

zero in order to match the low observed correlations of consumption and dividend growth with the
price-dividend ratio.
In the second panel of Table 1 the model-implied mean risk free rate is 0.006, consistent
with the sample value of 0.005. The model-implied volatility and autocorrelation of the risk free
rate are lower than their sample counterparts.
The model-implied mean equity return is 0.063, close to the sample value of 0.061. The
model-implied volatility of the market return is 0.17, slightly lower than the sample value
of 0.20. The autocorrelation of the market return is low both in the data and the model.
The model-implied mean and autocorrelation of the price-dividend ratio are 3.14 and 0.95,
respectively, in agreement with their sample values of 3.39 and 0.86, respectively, but the
model-implied volatility (0.26) is lower than the sample value (0.46).
Overall the model rationalizes the high mean market return, t he volatility of the market
return, and the low mean risk free rate observed in the data. Therefore it offers an explanation of the
equity premium and risk free rate puzzles. It also rationalizes the mean and, to some extent, the
volatility of the market-wide price-dividend ratio, thereby partly accounting for the excess volatility
puzzle.
In the third panel of Table 1 we display the point estimates of the parameters along with the
associated standard errors (Newey-West (1987) corrected using two lags) in parentheses. The point
estimates of the coefficient of RRA, 14.6, and the EIS, 2, suggest preference for early resolution of
uncertainty. The point estimates of the transition probabilities strongly suggest the existence of at
least two regimes, since π 1 is very different from 1 − π 2 . The consumption and dividend growth rates
have higher mean in the first regime than in the second one. It is tempting to refer to the first

24

regime as the regime of economic expansions and the second regime as the regime
which encompasses economic contractions and recoveries but in Section 7 we
provide caveats to such an interpretation.
Finally note that, in the above estimation the signal is left unspecified and, therefore, its
informativeness is left unconstrained. Not surprisingly we find that the model estimates a signal that is
almost perfectly informative. Recall that the signal is standardized to have volatility equal to one in both
regimes and mean zero in the first regime by construction. In the third panel of Table 1 the estimated
mean of the signal is –3.54 in the second regime. This implies that the signal is very informative as it is
drawn from two very different distributions in the two regimes.
The signal is highly persistent with a first-order autocorrelation coefficient of 0.77. At first sight
it may seem puzzling that the signal has persistence that is an order of magnitude higher than those of
consumption and dividend growth (0.02 and 0.05, respectively) despite all of these variables being
driven by the same underlying state. However a closer look reveals that, for given values of the transition
probabilities, the first-order autocorrelation coefficient of each of these variables is increasing in the
ratio of the squared difference between the means in the two states to the constant variance,

(µ

− µ y ,2 ) / σ y2 . For the consumption and dividend growth rates this ratio is 0.11 and 0.28,
2

y ,1

respectively, while for the signal x this ratio is two orders of magnitude higher at 12.53. This explains
the substantially higher persistence of the signal compared to that of the consumption and dividend
growth rates. Very similar results (presented in Section 6) are obtained when we constrain the signal
to equal a particular macroeconomic variable. We argue in Section 6 that this feature of the signal
plays a key role in generating the asset pricing results. Moreover it does so without relying on
excessive predictability of consumption and dividend growth rates that are difficult to measure in
the data.
25

4.3

Estimation Results for the Alternative Model
(Learning only from consumption history)

We re-estimate the model when investors learn from consumption history alone. The results are
reported in Table 2. The main shortcoming of this model is that it implies essentially zero volatility
of the price-dividend ratio, grossly at odds with its sample counterpart of 0.46. The flat price-dividend
ratio causes the volatility of the market return to equal the volatility of the dividend growth rate,
contrary to the observed higher volatility of the market return relative to dividend growth. Thus the
model fails to explain the excess volatility puzzle.
Furthermore, the model-implied autocorrelation of the price-dividend ratio is only 0.21, at
odds with the autocorrelation of 0.86 observed in the data. Thus the model fails to generate the high
persistence in the market-wide price-dividend ratio—one of the most robust features observed in the
data. Finally, as shown in Section 7, since the model-implied price-dividend ratio is essentially
constant, the model counterfactually implies a pro-cyclical expected market return (driven by procyclical expected dividend growth) and flat conditional volatility of the market return. Some
shortcomings of this model have earlier been highlighted in Johannes, Lochstoer, and Mou (2016)
and our results confirm and extend their findings.
[Table 2 here]

5

What Are Potential Signals?

In the previous section the signal was deliberately left unspecified to highlight the role of
expanding the information set of investors. In this section we proceed to shed light on potential
sources of the signal. At the core of the consumption-based asset pricing literature is the insight
that prices reflect investors’ beliefs about macroeconomic outcomes. This naturally raises a
number of central questions. Given the large amount of macroeconomic information available to
investors which subset of information do investors pay the most attention to? How do they process
this information to form beliefs about macroeconomic outcomes? Learning models typically
hypothesize that investors learn about the latent economic regime from the history of consumption
alone. These models perform poorly in explaining several stylized facts of asset market data. Our
results in Section 4 suggest that the poor performance of these models may potentially be attributed
to the restrictive assumption that the information set of investors is the history of aggregate
consumption alone. In this section we present further evidence supporting this argument by
showing that a substantial fraction of the variation in the price-dividend ratio is indeed explained
by variations in macroeconomic variables but not by the one variable commonly assumed in the
literature, namely aggregate consumption growth.
We relate the market-wide price-dividend ratio to a broad cross-section of publicly
available macroeconomic variables. The 106 macroeconomic variables we consider are obtained
from the Global Insights Basic Economic Database and may be broadly classified into the
following six categories: (1) output and income, which includes personal income, industrial
production index (total as well as disaggregated by the type of product), and capacity utilization
measures; (2) labor markets, which includes the unemployment rate, unemployment insurance
claims, average hourly earnings, average hours of production, and employees in different sectors;
27

(3) housing, which includes the number of authorized permits to build houses and the number of
new housing constructions started in different geographical regions of the US; (4) consumption,
orders, and inventories, which includes real personal consumption expenditures, the Index of
Consumer Expectations, manufacturing and trade sales, manufacturing and trade inventories, and
new orders for different types of goods (consumer goods and materials, durable goods, nondefense
capital goods); (5) money and credit, including M1, M2, currency held by the public, commercial
and industrial loans outstanding, consumer credit outstanding, and the ratio of consumer
installment credit to personal income; and (6) prices, which includes the producer price index for
different types of goods, the consumer price index for different goods and services, and the
commodity prices index.
The price-dividend ratio is highly persistent but its first-order autocorrelation coefficient
at 0.86 is statistically smaller than one over the entire available sample period from 1929 to 2013.
We difference some of the macroeconomic variables to make them stationary. We refer the reader
to Sydney Ludvigson’s website for a detailed description of the macroeconomic variables and the
transformations applied to make them stationary. Each of the transformed variable has first-order
autocorrelation coefficient less than 0.9.
We relate the price-dividend ratio to the macroeconomic variables by running univariate
regressions of the log price-dividend ratio on the level (if stationary) or the first difference of the
106 macroeconomic variables. In figure 1 we present the R 2 of these regressions. The figure
reveals that inflation variables and, to a lesser extent, labor market variables are strongly related
to the price-dividend ratio. We obtain a similar ranking when we regress the price-dividend ratio
on an exponentially-weighted moving average of the current and lagged values of the macro
variables with five and ten lags. In light of the concern that regressions of one persistent variable
28

(the price-dividend ratio) on other persistent variables (the macroeconomic variables) may produce
spurious results, in figure 2 we present the R 2 from univariate regressions of the first difference
of the log price-dividend ratio on the first difference of the 106 transformed macroeconomic
variables. The R 2 s are lower than in figure 1 but the rankings are the same as in figure 1.
[Figures 1 and 2 here]
The inflation variables include the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Producer Price Index
(PPI), and the implicit price deflator for personal consumption expenditures. The regression of the
price-dividend ratio on the CPI-U growth for all items has R 2 = 48.2% . The regressions on the
CPI-U growth for disaggregated expenditure categories all have high R 2 as well: 66.0% for
apparel and upkeep, 61.5% for medical care, 58.8% for durables, 49.4% for services, 40.4%
for commodities, and 19.4% for transportation. Regressions on the growth of the implicit price
deflator for personal consumption expenditures on durables, nondurables, and services have high
R 2 : 70.5%, 27.3%, and 63.0%, respectively. Finally regressions on the PPI growth variables have

somewhat smaller, but still substantial, R 2 : 27.4% for finished goods, 18.8% for finished consumer
goods, and 15.9% for intermediate materials supplies and components.
The second category of variables strongly related to the price-dividend ratio corresponds
to the labor market. In particular regressions on the growth of average hourly earnings on private
nonfarm payrolls in the manufacturing sector, goods-producing sector, and construction sector
have R 2 42.4%, 36.8%, and 20.7%, respectively. Regressions on the growth of average weekly
hours on private nonfarm payrolls in the manufacturing and goods-producing sectors have R 2
30.8% and 24.6%, respectively. Finally regressions on the growth in the number of employees on

29

nonfarm payrolls in the financial sector, retail trade sector, wholesale trade, and trade,
transportation, and utilities sector have R 2 13.4%, 13.3%, 11.4%, and 10.8%, respectively.
In contrast a regression of the price-dividend ratio on the contemporaneous consumption
growth produces a statistically insignificant slope coefficient and R 2 = 1.7% ; and regressions of
the price-dividend ratio on an exponentially-weighted moving average of the contemporaneous
and lagged consumption growth rates produce even smaller R 2 = 0.72% and 0.05%, respectively,
when five and ten lags of the consumption growth are included in the regressor. Similar results
obtain for the dividend growth rate—contemporaneous dividend growth produces an 𝑅𝑅 2 = 0.7%,
and a moving average of dividend growth with five and ten lags produce 𝑅𝑅 2 = 3.0% and 4.8%,

respectively.

The first, second, and third principal components of the transformed macroeconomic
variables explain 40.6%, 20.0%, and 8.8%, respectively, of the variation of these macroeconomic
variables. We relate the price-dividend ratio to each of the principal components by running
univariate regressions of the log price-dividend ratio on each of the first six principal components
and obtain R 2 of 0%, 49%, 0%, 12%, 6%, and 1%, respectively. Essentially the second principal
component of changes in the macroeconomic variables (2nd PC) is highly correlated with the marketwide price-dividend ratio while the other principal components are not. Figure 3 presents the R 2
from univariate regressions of the 2nd PC on each of the 106 transformed macroeconomic variables.
Not surprisingly the 2nd PC loads most heavily on inflation and labor market variables. In figure 4
we present the R 2 from univariate regressions at the quarterly frequency. The R 2 s are very similar
to those at the annual frequency.
[Figures 3 and 4 here]
30

Note that most macroeconomic variables are either pro-cyclical or counter-cyclical.
However, this does not necessarily imply that they are strongly correlated with the price-dividend
ratio or serve as informative signals in the context of our model. Figure 5 displays the time series
of the log price-dividend ratio, consumption and GDP growth, CPI growth, and hourly earnings
growth; and figure 6 displays the time series of the first three principal components of the
covariance matrix of the 106 macroeconomic variables. All these variables have a business-cycle
pattern but consumption growth, GDP growth, and the first and third principal components of the
covariance matrix are neither strongly correlated with the price-dividend ratio nor serve as
informative signals in the context of our model, as we show in Section 6.
[Figures 5 and 6 here]
The above results suggest that inflation and labor market variables and the 2nd PC (that heavily
loads on inflation and labor market variables) play an important role in explaining variation in asset
prices. In Table 3 we report regressions of the log price-dividend ratio on the CPI-U growth, earnings
per hour growth, and the 2nd PC over the full period from 1964 to 2013 (panel A) as well as two nonoverlapping subperiods from 1964 to 1988 (panel B) and from 1989 to 2013 (panel C). We also report
these regressions in first differences. Over the full sample period as well as both subperiods, these
variables have statistically significant explanatory power for the log price-dividend ratio. The last row
of panel C presents out-of-sample 𝑅𝑅 2 s over the latter subperiod from 1989 to 2013.1 The out-of-

sample 𝑅𝑅 2 s are large for the CPI-U growth and 2nd PC and, more importantly, similar in magnitude
to the in-sample values obtained over the same subperiod.

The out-of-sample 𝑅𝑅2 is computed by estimating the regression parameters over the first subperiod from 1964 to 1988
and then using the estimated parameters to obtain the fitted values of the regression in the second subperiod from 1989 to
2013.
1

31

[Table 3 here]
These results should be interpreted with caution. The CPI and earnings per hour can be
unreliable univariate signals regarding expectations of economic growth and the resulting pricedividend ratio. Expectations of high economic growth lead to wage pressure and inflation depending
on productivity growth, tightness of the labor supply, and the ability of firms to automate production,
push employees to work longer hours and harder, or outsource work to foreign contractors, as
manifested by the flipping of correlation signs. The correlation between CPI-U growth and the pricedividend ratio is -62%, -50%, and -33% in the subperiods from 1966 to 1985, from 1986 to 2005, and
from 2006 to 2011, respectively; and the correlation between change in earnings per hour and the
price-dividend ratio is -48%, 15%, and -53% in the subperiods from 1966 to 1985, from 1986 to 2005,
and from 2006 to 2011, respectively. While the correlation between CPI-U growth and the pricedividend ratio seems consistently negative, the correlation is close to zero at -6% since the turn of the
century. By contrast the correlation between the 2nd PC and the price-dividend ratio is consistently
positive in any subperiod – the correlations are 62%, 49%, and 37%, respectively, over subperiods
1966 to 1985, 1986 to 2005, and 2006 to 2011; and 19% since 2001 to the present. The same applies
to correlations between their growth rates. It appears that the 2nd PC blends signals from inflation, the
labor market, and other macroeconomic variables in a way that captures the economic conditions
under which expectations of high economic growth lead to wage pressure and inflation. The changing
economic conditions are also highlighted in David and Veronesi (2013) who study learning from
inflation shocks and address the changing sign of the correlation between stock and bond returns.
We present predictive regressions of 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year ahead consumption and dividend
growth and market return by the 2nd PC (Table 4, left panels), CPI-U growth (Table 5, left panels),
and earnings per hour growth from 1964 to 2013 (Table 6, left panels). The rationale for these
32

predictive regressions is as follows. If signals drive the variation in the price-dividend ratio then
these signals should forecast future cash flow growth. Table 4 confirms that this is indeed the case.
The 2nd PC has statistically significant predictive power for dividend growth one, two, and five
years ahead (the coefficient is statistically insignificant for three years ahead dividend growth);
and it has statistically insignificant predictive power for consumption growth and market return.
CPI growth predicts dividend growth one, two, and three years ahead (the coefficient is statistically
insignificant for five years ahead dividend growth); and it has statistically insignificant predictive
power for consumption growth and market return. Earnings per hour growth has statistically
significant predictive power for dividend growth one and two years ahead (the coefficient is
statistically insignificant for three and five years ahead dividend growth); it has statistically
insignificant predictive power for consumption growth except for five years ahead; and it has
statistically insignificant predictive power for market return. The right panels of Tables 4, 5, and
6 present the model-implied predictive regressions that produce results very similar to those
obtained in the data and are discussed in Section 6.
[Tables 4-6 here]

The Information that Drives Asset Prices

6.1

Estimation Results with Specified Signal

In Section 4 the signal was deliberately left unspecified in order to show that consumption growth
is an incomplete signal and that investors’ beliefs are driven by some signal in addition to
consumption growth. In this section we demonstrate that the model fit remains largely intact when
we replace the latent signal with the 2nd PC, CPI-U growth, or earnings per hour growth. The
33

results highlight the informational role of macroeconomic variables and suggest that just one
macroeconomic variable along with consumption growth goes a long way towards proxying for
the investors’ relevant information set.
In the first example we constrain the signal to equal the 2nd PC. Thus equation (4) that
describes the dynamics of the signal is replaced by the following equation:
nd
2=
PCt +1 µ 2nd PC , s + σ 2nd PC ε 2nd PC ,t +1 ,
t +1

(19)

where 2nd PC is the second principal component extracted from the macroeconomic variables and

ε2

nd

PC ,t +1

is i.i.d. standard normal and orthogonal to ε c ,t +1 and

ε d ,t +1 . Equation (19) has three

parameters, µ 2nd PC ,1 , µ 2nd PC ,2 , and σ 2nd PC , which is two more parameters than equation (4) in which
we set µ x ,1 =0 and σ = 1 . However the 2nd PC dynamics now have to match four additional
moment restrictions: the mean, variance, and first-order autocorrelation of the 2nd PC and the
correlation between the price-dividend ratio and the 2nd PC .
The results are presented in Table 7 and cover the period from 1966 to 2011. The estimated
moments are somewhat different from the corresponding moments estimated from 1929 to 2013,
particularly the volatility of dividend growth and the correlation between consumption and
dividend growth, as reported in Table 1. In the first two panels of Table 7 we display the sample
moments and the model-generated moments of the consumption and dividend growth rates, market
return, risk free rate, and market-wide price-dividend ratio.
[Table 7 here]

34

Even though the signal is forced to be the 2nd PC instead of being left unspecified and
there are two additional overidentifying restrictions in the estimation, the model does reasonably
well in matching the data. In the first panel of Table 7 we see that the model matches the mean
(0.014 versus 0.019) and volatility (0.015 versus 0.013) of consumption growth but not its
autocorrelation. However, the model-implied second-, third- and fifth-order autocorrelations are
0.021, 0.020, and 0.018, respectively, in closer agreement with the corresponding data-implied
autocorrelations at 0.188, 0.065, and 0.046, respectively. The model does less well in matching
the mean (0.025 versus 0.010), volatility (0.142 versus 0.067) and autocorrelation (0.038 versus
0.270) of dividend growth, the latter two possibly due to dividend smoothing. The model matches
the correlation of consumption and dividend growth (0.345 versus 0.323) and generates the low
correlations between consumption growth and the price-dividend ratio and between dividend
growth and the price-dividend ratio observed in the data.
In the second panel of Table 7 the model rationalizes the mean, volatility, and
autocorrelation of the risk free rate, market return, and price-dividend ratio. In the third panel the
model matches well the moments of the 2nd PC and the high correlation between the 2nd PC and
the price-dividend ratio. Not reported in the table, the model-implied second-, third-, and fifthorder autocorrelations of the 2nd PC are 0.62, 0.59, and 0.53, respectively, in reasonable
agreement with the corresponding data-implied autocorrelations at 0.49, 0.40, and 0.46,
respectively.
In the fourth panel the conditional means of the 2nd PC are 0.746 and -2.661 in the two
states, respectively, and the volatility is 0.972, rendering the signal highly informative. The modelimplied RRA and IES are similar to those obtained in the model with unspecified signal (Table 1).
The other parameter estimates are reasonable. In particular, the two regimes are very persistent
35

with persistence comparable to that of the regimes when the signal is left unspecified (Table 1).
Overall, the model provides an excellent fit to the data.
The model-implied price-dividend ratio is a known function of investors’ beliefs which in
turn is a known function of the history of consumption growth and the 2nd PC . We use the time
series of consumption growth and the 2nd PC and obtain the time series of the model-implied
price-dividend ratio. Using the parameter estimates in Table 7 the correlation between the modelimplied price-dividend ratio and the price-dividend ratio observed in the data is 0.77. The
alternative model, on the other hand, produces correlation zero between the model-implied and
historical price-dividend ratios. This is because the model-implied price-dividend ratio is an almost
flat function of the beliefs in the alternative model. As a robustness check, in the Appendix, we
present the corresponding estimation results at the quarterly frequency and verify that they are very
similar to those in Table 7.
In Section 4 we contrasted the model fit when investors learn from consumption history and
a latent signal (Table 1) with the results when investors learn from consumption history alone (Table
2) over the period from 1929 to 2013 and concluded that the latter model implies essentially zero
volatility of the price-dividend ratio, grossly at odds with its sample counterpart. We extend this
comparison over the subperiod from 1964 to 2013 and reach a similar conclusion. We re-estimate
the model when investors learn from consumption history alone over the subperiod from 1964 to
2013 and present the results in Table 8. The model fails along dimensions similar to those for the full
period. In particular the model-implied volatility of the price-dividend ratio is essentially zero and its
autocorrelation is much lower than that in the data, demonstrating that the alternative model does not
fit the data.
[Table 8 here]
36

In the second example we constrain the signal to equal CPI-U growth (Table 9) and in the
third example we constrain the signal to equal the earnings per hour growth (Table 10). The results
are strikingly similar to the results in Table 7. On the other hand, setting the signal equal to GDP
growth or the first or third principal component of the macroeconomic variables produces results
similar to the learning from consumption alone model, thereby demonstrating that these variables
do not serve as informative signals in the context of our model. (These latter results are available
from the authors upon request.)
[Tables 9 and 10 here]

6.2

Model-Implied Predictive Regressions

In Section 5 we motivated the choice of the 2nd PC, CPI-U growth, and earnings per hour growth as
signals by presenting evidence in the left panels of Tables 4-6 that these variables predict dividend
growth at various horizons. In the right panels of these tables we present the corresponding modelimplied predictive regressions and compare them to the data-implied ones.
For the 2nd PC regressions we use the point estimates in Table 7 and generate a simulated
time series of the consumption and dividend growth, market return, and the 2nd PC of length one
million years. In the right panels of Table 4 we present the coefficient estimates and 𝑅𝑅 2 from the
predictive regressions on the simulated data. We estimate the 95% confidence intervals of the

coefficients and 𝑅𝑅 2 by performing these predictive regressions in 10,000 simulated samples of
length 50 years each which is the same length as the historical sample.

Consistent with the data, the 2nd PC has little forecasting power for consumption growth at
any horizon. The 2nd PC forecasts one-year ahead consumption growth with a coefficient of 0.001
and 𝑅𝑅 2 1.3% in the data. The corresponding model-implied values are remarkably similar at 0.001

37

and 1.8%, respectively. Similar results obtain for the longer horizons. Likewise, consistent with
the data, the 2nd PC does not forecast the market return at any horizon. The 2nd PC mildly forecasts
one-year ahead dividend growth with a coefficient of 0.021 and 𝑅𝑅 2 9.8% in the data. The

corresponding model-implied values are 0.014 and 2.9%, respectively. Similar results obtain for
the longer horizons. Finally similar results obtain for the CPI growth regressions (Table 5) and the
earnings per hour growth regressions (Table 6). Overall the predictive regressions provide strong
support for the economic mechanism highlighted in the model as well as the ability of the model
to quantitatively match predictive patterns observed in the data.

Discussion of the Results and Interpretation of the
Economic Regimes

In Sections 4 and 6 we showed that the main model fits the data reasonably well while the
alternative model fails along several dimensions. The success of the main model is a particularly
strong result because it derives solely from expanding the information set of investors to include
either an unspecified signal or one of a number of macroeconomic variables over and above
consumption growth. The question then arises as to what drives the superior performance of the
main model. We illustrate the intuition using the parameter estimates in Table 7 where the signal
is set equal to the 2nd PC.
The crux of the intuition lies in the response of the price-dividend ratio to changes in
beliefs, pt , and, therefore, to changing expectations about future dividend growth. In the main
model the belief process has high persistence (first-order autocorrelation coefficient of 0.95) and
low variance while in the alternative model the belief process has lower persistence (first-order
38

autocorrelation coefficient of 0.75) and high variance. In the main model the current value of pt
is highly informative about the future and, therefore, the price-dividend ratio sharply responds to
changes in pt . This makes the price-dividend ratio highly volatile in this model. By contrast in the
alternative model the current value of pt typically provides little information about the future and,
therefore, the price-dividend ratio is essentially constant. Below we elaborate on this intuition.

7.1

Interpretation of the Economic Regimes

Whereas it is tempting to interpret the first regime as the regime of economic expansions
and the second regime as the regime which encompasses economic recessions and
recoveries there are caveats to such an interpretation. We earlier pointed out in figures 5
and 6 that most macroeconomic variables are either pro-cyclical or counter-cyclical but this does
not necessarily imply that they are strongly correlated with the price-dividend ratio or serve as
informative signals in the context of our model. Consumption growth, GDP growth, and the first
and third principal components of the covariance matrix of the macroeconomic variables are
neither strongly correlated with the price-dividend ratio nor serve as informative signals.
The correlations of recessions with the 2nd PC, CPI-U growth, and earnings growth are
higher at -41%, 47%, and 33%, respectively, but lower than 50%. We extract the time series of the
beliefs process from the observed price-dividend ratio and risk free using the parameter estimates
in Table 7 for the main model and in Table 8 for the alternative model. For the main model the
correlation of beliefs with the business cycle is -24% and for the alternative model the correlation

39

is 0.6%. 2 Figure 7 plots the time series of the beliefs in the main model from 1964 to
2013. The results suggest that the regimes are correlated, albeit imperfectly, with
the business cycle.
[Figure 7 here]

7.2

The Beliefs Process

In figure 8 we illustrate the conditional variance of the beliefs, var ( pt +1 | pt ) , as a function of pt
in the main model (red line). The estimates of the transition probabilities for the main model are
0.99 and 0.96, respectively, compared to 0.98 and 0.80, respectively, for the alternative model, i.e.
the transition probability for the second regime is much higher in the main model than in the
alternative model. If pt = 0, we have 𝐸𝐸[𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡+1 |𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 = 0] = 0.04, 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉[𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡+1 |𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 = 0] = 0.03, and,
therefore, pt +1 is likely to remain close to 0 with a fair degree of certainty. In other words, the
investor is able to reliably forecast the regime in the next period given the current period
realizations of consumption growth and the rate of inflation. A similar argument holds when

pt = 1; in fact, in this case 𝐸𝐸[𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡+1 |𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 = 1] = 0.99 and the conditional variance of pt +1 is even

closer to zero (𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉[𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡+1 |𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 = 1] = 0.006) than when pt = 0 and, therefore, pt +1 is likely to be
close to 1 with an even greater degree of certainty. In contrast when pt = 0.5 we have

𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉[𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡+1 |𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 = 0.5] = 0.21 and it is difficult for the investor to forecast the regime next period.

To summarize, there is a lot of uncertainty about the future when pt is around 0.5 but not when

Correlation with recessions is computed as the correlation with a dummy variable that takes the value 1 in a year if
at least one of the quarters in that year is in an NBER-designated recession period and takes the value 0 otherwise.
2

40

pt is near its boundaries of 0 or 1. This implies that the investor has a strong precautionary savings
motive around pt = 0.5 that declines as pt approaches its boundaries. This generates nonlinearities in the equilibrium solutions for the price-dividend ratio, the expected market return, and
the conditional variance of the market return.
[Figure 8 here]
The above results stand in contrast to the alternative model. In figure 6 we also illustrate
the conditional variance of the beliefs, var ( pt +1 | pt ) , as a function of pt in the alternative model
(blue line). The conditional variance is an inverted U-shaped function of pt as in the main model
but, unlike the main model, it has a value higher than 0.13 for all values of pt between 0 and 0.76.
When the variance is 0.13 the conditional volatility is 0.36 and the 95% confidence interval for the
distribution of (𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡+1 |𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 ) covers almost the entire permissible region. This means that the investor
observes the realization of Ct and accurately infers the regime at date t because 𝜇𝜇𝑐𝑐,1 = 0.016 is
very different from 𝜇𝜇𝑐𝑐,2 = −0.034 and the volatility of consumption growth is low at 0.019.

However, this typically provides little information as to which regime the economy will be in next
period (except when the current pt is very high). Thus there is a lot of uncertainty about the regime
next period although there is low uncertainty about the current regime. Once Ct +1 is realized the
investor accurately updates her beliefs regarding the regime. This implies that pt has lower
persistence and higher variance.
The above feature of the learning process explains why the price-dividend ratio is flat in
the alternative model. The price-dividend ratio moves in response to changing expectations about
future returns and/or future dividend growth. The current realization of pt provides little
41

information about the future for over three quarters of possible values of pt and, therefore, the
price-dividend ratio is unresponsive to changes in pt . To help improve the performance of the
model, Johannes, Lochstoer, and Mou (2016) introduce model and parameter uncertainty. Even
though the investor learns from consumption alone, model and parameter uncertainty slows down
the learning process and imparts higher persistence in pt compared to the persistence of
consumption growth and this improves the model fit to the data.

7.3

The Risk Free Rate

In figure 9 we plot the risk free rate as a function of the probability of the first state in the main
model (red line) and in the alternative model (blue line). In the main model the risk free rate is Ushaped. We earlier cautioned that in the main model the second state should not be interpreted as
the recession state. Indeed the risk free rate is lowest not when the probability of being in the
second state is the highest ( pt = 0 ) but around pt ≈ 0.75 when the conditional variance of beliefs
and, therefore, uncertainty is high.
In the alternative model the risk free rate is monotonically increasing in the probability of
the first state and is lowest when the probability of being in the second state is the highest

( pt

= 0).

[Figure 9 here]

42

7.4

The Price-Dividend Ratio

In figure 10 we display the price-dividend ratio as a function of the probability of the expansion
state, pt , in the main model (red line) and the alternative model (blue line). In the main model the
price-dividend ratio is sharply increasing and convex in the probability of being in the first state
(red line). This nonlinearity justifies our approach of eschewing the Campbell and Shiller (1988)
log-linearization or any other form of approximation in solving the model. By contrast in the
alternative model the price-dividend ratio is (almost) flat in the probability (blue line) because, as
explained in Section 7.2, the current beliefs are not very informative about the future. The latter
model is, therefore, unable to generate the observed volatility of the price-dividend ratio.
[Figure 10 here]

7.5

The Expected Market Return

In figure 11 we display the expected market return as a function of the probability of the expansion
state. The alternative model implies that the expected market return is an increasing function of pt
(blue line), leading to the counterfactual prediction of procyclical expected market return. This
occurs because in the alternative model the price-dividend ratio is almost constant and the expected
dividend growth is an increasing function of pt .
[Figure 11 here]
In the main model, on the other hand, when 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 = 0.5 there is maximum uncertainty about

the current regime. The estimates of the preference parameters suggest a strong preference for

early resolution of uncertainty. Therefore the expected market return is at its highest around this

43

point (red line). As pt increases between 0 and 0.5 there are two competing forces. On the one
hand there is more uncertainty about the regime that causes the expected market return to increase;
and, on the other hand, there is a higher probability of being in the first regime and this causes the
expected market return to decrease. The former effect dominates because of the strong preference
for early resolution of uncertainty, causing the expected market return to increases with an increase
in pt over this range. As pt increases from 0.5 towards 1 uncertainty is decreasing that the
economy is in the good regime. Therefore the expected market return is decreasing in pt over this
range.
In figure 12 we display the expected market return as a function of the price-dividend ratio.
In the main model the expected market return is strongly concave in the price-dividend ratio. This
highly non-linear pattern is unlike the common practice of predicting the market return with the
price-dividend ratio with a linear regression. In the alternative model the plot of the expected
market return as a function of the price-dividend ratio does not make sense because the pricedividend ratio is insensitive to changes in

pt (blue line).

[Figure 12 here]
In figure 13 we display the conditional variance of the market return. The conditional
variance of the market return depends on the conditional variance of the price-dividend ratio and
dividend growth. The conditional variance of both of these variables depend on the conditional
variance of pt +1 . Now the conditional variance of pt +1 is an inverted U-shaped function of pt +1 —
being the highest when pt ≈ 0.5 and declining when pt approaches its boundaries of 0 or 1. In the
alternative model the price-dividend ratio is almost constant and, therefore, the conditional
variance of the market return is driven only by the conditional variance of dividend growth. The
44

latter is small to be consistent with the data and therefore the conditional variance of the market
return is low and almost flat (blue line). In the main model uncertainty about the current regime
peaks around 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 = 0.5 and, therefore, the conditional variance of the market return peaks around

𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 = 0.5 (red line). To summarize, the main model, unlike the alternative model, generates strong

time-variation in the conditional mean and variance of the stock market return. And it does so without
relying on heteroscedasticity of the aggregate consumption and dividend growth rates—a
phenomenon for which there is limited empirical evidence.
[Figure 13 here]
Note that the main model’s implications that the expected market return and the conditional
variance of the market return are the highest and the risk free rate lowest around 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 = 0.5 may seem

contrary to conventional wisdom that these should be the highest and lowest, respectively, when
𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 ≈ 0, i.e. when we are certain that the economy is in a recession. To help interpret this implication

of the model, consider the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath. This was not a macroeconomic
disaster episode like the Great Depression. However, there was considerable uncertainty at the time
about the future of the economy. The period 2008-2013 can, therefore, be characterized as a period
of low growth (negative growth for the years 2008 and 2009) and moderate levels of inflation. Thus,
in the context of our model, it can be characterized as a period with significant uncertainty, i.e. 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡

lies away from its boundaries. Note that expected returns and conditional variance of returns were
arguably exceptionally high during this period, consistent with the model – the volatility of the
market return over this 6-year period was 26.4% compared to a volatility of 17.9% over the entire
period 1964-2013 in Table 6. Note, however, that consumption growth was not more volatile over
this 6-year period compared to the whole period (1.1% versus 1.3%). This is, once again, consistent
with the model.
45

8

The Nominal and Real Term Structures

The recent macro finance literature has increasingly emphasized the importance of a unified
framework for pricing different classes of financial assets. In this section we assess the performance
of our main model in explaining the average term structure of interest rates. This is a challenging
test of the model because neither nominal nor real yields of any maturity (other than the short term
real interest rate) are targeted in the estimation of the model parameters.
We first consider the nominal term structure. Note that, since we argue that the rate of
inflation is one of the major components of the signal over and above consumption growth and
model the dynamics of the inflation process, our main model has implications for the nominal term
structure. Table 11, panel A, presents the means and volatilities of yields on nominal bonds with
maturities spanning one to 30 years, over the entire available sample period from 1962 to 2013. The
table shows that the nominal term structure is strongly upward sloping, with the mean yields varying
from 5.5% for one-year bonds to 7.3% for 30-year bonds. The volatilities of the yields, on the other
hand, are slightly declining with maturity, varying from 3.2% for one-year bonds to 2.8% for 30year bonds. We use the parameter estimates from Table 9 to obtain the corresponding modelimplied means and volatilities of yields. These are reported in panel B. Consistent with the data, the
model generates an upward sloping term structure. Moreover, the mean yields vary from 5.8% for
one-year bonds to 6.9% for 30-year bonds, in close agreement with their data counterparts. Because,
as we discuss below, the model-implied real term structure is flat, the main model, unlike the long
run risks model, does not rely on a high inflation risk premium to match the nominal term structure.
Also, as in the data, the volatilities of the yields decline with maturity.
[Table 11 here]
46

We next consider the term structure of real bonds. Table 11, panel C, reports the means and
volatilities of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) with maturities five to 20 years, over
the entire available sample period from 2003 to 2013. The data suggest a mild positive slope of the
term structure with the mean yields varying from 0.8% for five-year bonds to 1.7% for 20-year
bonds that should be interpreted with caution owing to the small sample size. We use the parameter
estimates reported in Table 9 for the model where the signals are consumption and CPI growth to
obtain the corresponding model-implied average yields. As shown in panel D of figure 9, the model
essentially implies a flat real term structure at 1.5%. This represents an improvement over long run
risks models that counterfactually imply a steep downward sloping real term structure. Note that
our results obtain although real yields with maturities beyond one year are not targets in the
estimation. The reason for this difference between our framework and the long run risks model is
that the former, unlike the latter, does not rely on high persistence of the aggregate consumption
growth. In the long run risks model consumption growth is strongly positively autocorrelated and
this makes long terms bonds a hedge against consumption risk, causing the term premium to be
negative. In our main model, on the other hand, the autocorrelation of consumption growth is close
to zero rendering the real term structure essentially flat.
Overall the main model matches well the nominal and real term structures of interest rates,
although none of the model parameters is estimated to match these moments. This lends further
support to the economic mechanism highlighted in the model.

Concluding Remarks

The market-wide price-dividend ratio is strongly correlated with certain categories of
macroeconomic variables, particularly inflation, labor market variables, and the 2nd PC of the
macroeconomic variables that heavily loads on inflation and labor market variables. By contrast
the price-dividend ratio has very small correlation with aggregate consumption and GDP growth,
the variables that investors are assumed to learn from in an extensive literature on learning in
financial markets. This suggests that the poor empirical performance of these learning models may
potentially be explained by the stringent information set imposed on investors, namely the
assumption that they learn from the history of consumption and GDP alone. In this paper we
explore the role of expanding the information set of investors in explaining several stylized facts
of stock market data.
We present a model of a real exchange economy with learning about the state of the
economy from consumption history and either a latent signal or an observed macroeconomic
variable, for example, the 2nd PC, CPI-U growth, or earnings per hour growth. The model offers
an explanation of the equity premium and risk free rate puzzles. It rationalizes the mean and, more
importantly, the volatility of the market-wide price-dividend ratio, thereby accounting for the excess
volatility puzzle. It matches the average real and nominal yields of Treasury bonds, both
at the short and long ends of the term structure. Finally, it is also consistent with the low
predictive power of the price-dividend ratio for future consumption and dividend growth. Our
findings suggest that the market rationally processes macroeconomic information in forming
beliefs and setting prices.

48

We re-estimate a nested version of the model in which the investors learn from consumption
history alone. The model fails to address the excess volatility puzzle, i.e. the observed high volatility
of the market return relative to dividend growth. It implies essentially zero volatility of the pricedividend ratio and significantly understates its autocorrelation. It also implies a procyclical expected
market return and near constant conditional volatility of returns, in sharp contrast to the strong
countercyclical patterns in these moments observed in the data. Our analysis highlights the pivotal
role of expanding the information set of the investors in addressing several seemingly puzzling
aspects of asset market data.
In future research one should endogenize the dependence of asset prices on certain
macroeconomics variables and explain why inflation captures expectations for future economic
growth in some periods but not in others, possibly depending on the tightness of the labor supply.

49

Appendix: Estimation Results at the Quarterly Frequency
To further establish the robustness of the key economic insight highlighted in the paper we assess
the performance of the model at the quarterly frequency. First we note that the same categories of
macroeconomic variables that have the highest explanatory power for the market-wide pricedividend ratio at the annual frequency are also the ones with the highest explanatory power at the
quarterly frequency. For instance, a regression of the price-dividend ratio on CPI-U growth has
𝑅𝑅 2 = 29.6%. Regressions of the price-dividend ratio on several disaggregated expenditure
categories produce even higher 𝑅𝑅 2 at 56.0% for medical care, 50.5% for durables, 40.7% for
services, and 38.9% for apparel and upkeep. Labor market variables such as the growth in average
hourly earnings in manufacturing has 𝑅𝑅 2 = 30.8%, and the growth in the average weekly hours

in manufacturing has 𝑅𝑅 2 = 35.4%. Also, the 2nd PC has 𝑅𝑅 2 = 33.4%. On the other hand
contemporaneous consumption growth has 𝑅𝑅 2 = 1.5% only, while a moving average of current

and lagged consumption growth has 𝑅𝑅 2 = 0.08% when five lags are included in the regressor.

Contemporaneous dividend growth has 𝑅𝑅 2 = 1.0% only, while a moving average of current and
lagged (five lags) growth rates has 𝑅𝑅 2 = 1.1%.

We next present the estimation results when the signal is set equal to the 2nd PC. The results

are presented in Table A.1 and are similar to those obtained at the annual frequency. In particular
the model matches well the mean, volatility, and first-order autocorrelation of the market return
and the price-dividend ratio. The model also matches well the mean of the risk free rate, while
understating its volatility as in the annual data. As for the fit for the macro data, the model matches
well the mean, volatility, and first-order autocorrelation of the 2nd PC extracted from the macro
variables; it also generates the high correlation between the 2nd PC and the price-dividend ratio
observed in the data.
50

There is significant seasonality in dividends at the quarterly frequency that is difficult to
correct for. We calculate quarterly dividends as the average dividends over the current and
previous three quarters. But this only offers an imperfect seasonal adjustment to dividends.
Therefore the sample moments of quarterly dividend growth should be interpreted with caution.
The model generates an annualized mean of 0.8% and volatility of 9.8% for dividend growth.
These are in line with the corresponding data-implied moments of 1.0% and 6.7%, respectively,
obtained using the more reliable annual dividend data over the same sample period. Also consistent
with the data, the model implies low correlation between dividend growth and the price-dividend
ratio.
The model fit for consumption growth is a little worse than that at the annual frequency.
The model underestimates the mean and first-order autocorrelation compared to the data and
overstates the volatility. However, consistent with the data, the model implies low higher-order
autocorrelations of consumption growth and also a low correlation between consumption growth
and the price-dividend ratio. Finally, the parameter estimates are very similar to those obtained at
the annual frequency.
Overall, the very similar performance of the regressions of the price-dividend ratio on the
macro variables and the good empirical performance of the main model at both the quarterly and
annual frequencies points to the robustness of our results.

Table 1: Model Fit and Parameter Estimates with Learning from both Consumption Growth and
an Unspecified Signal, 1929-2013
The table reports estimation results and model fit for the main model with learning from both consumption growth and an
unspecified signal, using annual data over the entire available sample period 1929-2013. The parameters are estimated using GMM.
Eighteen moment restrictions are used in the GMM, namely the mean, variance, and first-order auto-covariance of the consumption
and dividend growth rates, market return, risk free rate and the market-wide price-dividend ratio, the covariance between
consumption and dividend growth, the covariance between consumption growth and the price-dividend ratio, and the covariance
between dividend growth and the price-dividend ratio. The number of parameters to be estimated is thirteen. Panel C presents the
parameter estimates along with asymptotic standard errors in parentheses. The standard errors are Newey-West (1987) corrected
using two lags. Panels A and B present the sample moments (with standard errors in parentheses below) and the corresponding
model-implied moments (with simulated 95% confidence intervals in square brackets below) for the consumption and dividend
growth rates (Panel A) and asset prices and returns (Panel B). The confidence intervals are obtained as the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles
from 10,000 simulations of the same length as the historical sample.

Table 7: Model Fit and Parameter Estimates with Learning from both Consumption and 2nd
Principal Component, 1966-2011
The table reports estimation results and model fit for the main model, using consumption growth and the 2nd PC as signals over the
period 1966-2011. The parameters are estimated using GMM. Twenty-two moment restrictions are used in the GMM, namely the
mean, variance, and first-order auto-covariance of the consumption and dividend growth rates, the second principal component of
changes in macro variables, market return, risk free rate and the market-wide price-dividend ratio, the covariance between
consumption and dividend growth, the covariance between consumption growth and the price-dividend ratio, the covariance
between dividend growth and the price-dividend ratio, and the covariance between the second principal component and the pricedividend ratio. The number of parameters to be estimated is fifteen. Panel D presents the parameter estimates along with asymptotic
standard errors in parentheses. The standard errors are Newey-West (1987) corrected using two lags. Panels A, B and C present
the sample moments (with standard errors in parentheses below) and the corresponding model-implied moments (with simulated
95% confidence intervals in square brackets below) for the consumption and dividend growth rates (Panel A), asset prices and
returns (Panel B), and second principal component (Panel C). The confidence intervals are obtained as the 2.5th and 97.5th
percentiles from 10,000 simulations of the same length as the historical sample.

per Hour Growth, 1964-2013
The table reports estimation results and model fit for the main model, with consumption growth and the change in average hourly
earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls in the manufacturing sector ( ∆EAR ) as signals,
using annual data over the entire available sample period 1964-2013. The parameters are estimated using GMM. Twenty-one
moment restrictions are used in the GMM, namely the mean, variance, and first-order auto-covariance of the consumption and
dividend growth rates, the change in the average hourly earnings, market return, risk free rate and the market-wide price-dividend
ratio, the covariance between consumption and dividend growth, the covariance between consumption growth and the pricedividend ratio, and the covariance between the change in the average hourly earnings and the price-dividend ratio. The number of
parameters to be estimated is fourteen. Panel C presents the parameter estimates along with asymptotic standard errors in
parentheses. The standard errors are Newey-West (1987) corrected using two lags. Panels A and B present the sample moments
(with standard errors in parentheses below) and the corresponding model-implied moments (with simulated 95% confidence
intervals in square brackets below) for the consumption and dividend growth rates (Panel A) and asset prices and returns (Panel
B). The confidence intervals are obtained as the 5th and 95th percentiles from 10,000 simulations of the same length as the historical
