Flowers of Evil? Industrial Development and Long-Run Prosperity

ABSTRACT
This research explores the effect of industrialization on the process of development. In contrast to
conventional wisdom that views industrial development as a catalyst for economic growth, the
study establishes that while the adoption of industrial technology was conducive to economic
development in the short-run, it has detrimental effects on the standard of living in the long-run.
Exploiting exogenous geographic and climatic sources of variation in the diffusion and adoption
of steam engines across French departments during the early phases of industrialization, the
research establishes that intensive industrialization in the middle of the 19th century increased
income per capita in the subsequent decades but diminished it by the turn of the 21st century. The
analysis further suggests that the adverse effect of earlier industrialization on long-run prosperity
can be attributed to the negative impact of the adoption of unskilled-intensive technologies in the
early stages of industrialization on the long-run level of human capital and thus on the incentive
to adopt skill-intensive technologies in the contemporary era. Preferences and educational choices
of second generation migrants within France indicate that industrialization has triggered a dual
techno-cultural lock-in characterized by a reinforcing interaction between technological inertia,
reflected by the persistence predominance of low-skilled-intensive industries, and cultural inertia,
in the form of a lower predisposition towards investment in human capital. These findings
suggest that the characteristics that permitted the onset of industrialization, rather than the
adoption of industrial technology per se, have been the source of prosperity among the currently
developed economies that experienced an early industrialization. Thus, developing economies
may benefit from the allocation of resources towards human capital formation and skilled
intensive sectors rather than toward the promotion of traditional unskilled-intensive industrial
sectors.

The process of development has been marked by persistence as well as reversals in the relative wealth of
nations. While some geographical characteristics that were conducive for economic development in the agricultural stage had detrimental effects on the transition to the industrial stage of development, conventional
wisdom, as captured by Figure 1, suggests that prosperity has persisted among societies that experienced
an earlier industrialization.1

Regional development within advanced economies, nevertheless, appears far from being indicative of
the presence of a persistent beneficial effect of early industrialization. In particular, anecdotal evidence
suggests that regions which were prosperous industrial centers in Western Europe and in the Americas in
the 19th century (e.g., the Rust Belt in the USA, the Midlands in the UK, and the Ruhr valley in Germany)
have experienced a reversal in their comparative development.
These conflicting observations about the long-run effect of industrialization on the prosperity of regions
and nations may suggest that factors which fostered industrial development in the Western world, rather than
the forces of industrialization per se, are associated with the persistence of fortune across these industrial
nations. In particular, it is not inconceivable that the process of industrialization per se, despite its earlier
virtues, has had detrimental effects on the transition to the post-industrial stage of development and on
long-run prosperity. Nevertheless, despite the enormous importance of the resolution of this question from
a policy perspective, to a large extent, this issue has, neither been raised nor been explored in the modern
economic growth literature.
The research explores the long-run implications of industrialization on the process of development. It
1 The persistence effect of geographical, cultural, institutional and human characteristics have been at the center of a debate
regarding the origins of the differential timing of transitions from stagnation to growth and the remarkable transformation of
the world income distribution in the last two centuries (e.g., Acemoglu et al. (2001), Galor (2011), Andersen et al. (2016),
Ashraf and Galor (2013), Cervellati and Sunde (2005), Dalgaard and Strulik (2016), Galor and Özak (2016), Litina (2016),

addresses two fundamental questions: (i) is industrialization conducive for long-run prosperity? and (ii) are
the industrialized nations richer because of industrialization or perhaps despite industrialization? In contrast
to conventional wisdom that views industrial development as a catalyst for economic growth, highlighting
its persistent effect on economic prosperity, the study advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically
that while the adoption of industrial technology was conducive for economic development in the short-run,
acquired comparative advantage in the unskilled-intensive industrial sector had triggered cultural inertia,
characterized by a lower predisposition towards investment in human capital, that has hindered the transition
to more lucrative skilled-intensive sectors, adversely effecting human capital formation and the standards of
living in the long-run.
A conclusive exploration of the impact of industrialization on long-run prosperity ought to overcome
significant empirical hurdles. First, the observed relationship between industrialization and the development
process may reflect the reverse causality from the process of development to industrialization rather than
the effect of industrialization on the process of development. Second, the effect of institutional, cultural,
geographical and human characteristics on the joint evolution of industrialization and the process of development may have governed the observed relationship between industrialization and the development process.
Third, the time since industrialization in a large number of regions and countries is shorter than needed to
assess the potential adverse effects of industrialization on long-run prosperity.
In light of these empirical hurdles, the desirable empirical framework will be an economy in which:
(i) the territory has been divided into administrative units in which institutional, cultural, human and geographical characteristics are unlikely to differ significantly, (ii) the creation of administrative units preceded
the process of industrialization and is orthogonal to the subsequent process of industrialization, (iii) industrialization has occurred sufficiently early so as to permit the exploration of its potential adverse long-run
effects, (iv) exogenous source of regional variation in the intensity of industrialization could be identified,
and (iv) extensive data on the process of development since early industrialization is available.
The economy of France appears ideally suited for this empirical exploration for these reasons. First,
as early as 1790, the French territory was divided into administrative units (departments) of nearly equal
size, designed to ensure that travel distance by horse from any location within the department to the main
administrative center would not exceed one day. Hence, one can plausibly argue that the borders of each
department were orthogonal to the process of industrialization. Second, French departments have been
subjected to an intensive institutional and cultural unification that mitigated initial cultural differences
across these regions. Third, France was one of the first European countries to industrialize and the extended
period since its industrialization is sufficiently long to permit the detection of its potential adverse effect
on long-run prosperity. Fourth, exogenous sources of variation in the intensity of industrialization across
department could be detected. Finally, the availability of extensive data on the time paths of income per
capita, human capital formation, wages, sectoral employment, unionization rates, tariff protection, economic
integration and the availability of natural resources across departments permits the examination of the
proposed channels through which the adverse effect of industrialization may have operated.
The study utilizes French regional data from the second half of the 19th century until the beginning of
the 21st century to explore the impact of the adoption of industrial technology on the evolution of income
per capita. It establishes that regions which industrialized more intensively experienced higher income per

2

capita in the subsequent decades. Nevertheless, industrialization has had an adverse effect on income per
capita by the turn of the 21st century.
The identification strategy consists of two distinct components that govern: (i) the regional diffusion
and thus the supply of industrial technologies, and (ii) the differential decline in the profitability of the
agriculture sector across regions and thus variations in the pace of industrialization and the demand for
industrial technologies. First, in light of the association between industrialization and the intensity of the
use of the steam engine (Mokyr, 1990; Bresnahan and Trajtenberg, 1995; Rosenberg and Trajtenberg, 2004),
the study takes advantage of historical evidence regarding the regional diffusion of the steam engine (Ballot,
1923; Sée, 1925; Léon, 1976) to identify the effect of regional variations in the intensity of the use steam engine
in 1860-1865 on the process of development. In particular, it exploits the distances of each French department
from Fresnes-sur-Escaut, where a steam engine was first successfully operated for commercial use from 1732
onwards, as exogenous source of variations in industrialization across French regions.2 Second, the study
exploits contemporaneous regional variations in temperature deviations from their historical trend to capture
exogenous sources of variation in the profitability of agriculture and therefore the pace of industrialization
and the demand for steam engine technologies across regions.
Indeed, in line with the historical account, the unequal distribution of steam engines across French
departments is indicative of a local diffusion process from Fresnes-sur-Escaut. Accounting for confounding
geographical and institutional characteristics, pre-industrial development as well as distances from major
economic centers, if the distance of a department away from Fresnes-sur-Escaut was to increase from the
40th (426 km) to the 60th percentile (559 km) of the distance distribution, this department would experience
a drop of 275 horse power of steam engines (relative to a sample mean of 1839 hp) in the 1860-1865 industrial
survey.
The validity of the distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut as an instrumental variable for the intensity of
the adoption of steam engines across France is enhanced by three additional factors. First, conditional on
the distance between each department and Fresnes-sur-Escaut, distances from major centers of economic
power in 1860-1865 (e.g., Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Rouen, Mulhouse, Bordeaux, Berlin and London) are
uncorrelated with the intensive use of the steam engine over this period. Second, the distance from Fresnessur-Escaut is uncorrelated with the level and the growth rate of economic development across France in the
pre-industrial period. Third, it appears that the Nord department (where Fresnes-sur-Escaut is located) had
neither superior human capital characteristics nor higher standard of living in comparison to the average
department in France.
Furthermore, regional variations in temperature deviations from their historical trend in the years that
preceded the industrial survey is associated with regional variation in the profitability of agriculture (as
reflected by wheat prices), and in the reduced incentive to adopt the steam engine. In particular, conditional
on the distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut, in comparison to a department at the 40th percentile of the squared
temperature deviation (i.e., 0.14), a department with a 60th percentile of the squared temperature deviation
2 In 1726, an Englishman named John May obtained a privilege to operate steam engines to pump water throughout the
French kingdom. Jointly with another Englishman named John Meeres, he installed the first steam engine in Passy (which was
then outside but is now within the administrative boundaries of Paris) to raise water from the Seine river to supply the French
capital with water. However it seems that their commercial and industrial operation stopped quickly or even never took off.
Indeed, when Forest de Bélidor (1737) published his massive treatise on engineering in 1737-1739, he mentioned that the steam
engine in Fresnes-sur-Escaut was the only one operated in France (see, e.g., Lord (1923) and Dickinson (1939)).

3

(i.e., 0.25), will be expected to experience a drop of 13.9 in the horse power of steam engines. These
estimates suggest that, while the diffusion of the steam engine as well the transition from agriculture to
industry contributed to the adoption of steams engines, the effect of gradual diffusion of steam engines
from the North of France to the rest of the country dominated the effect of climatic volatility on the slower
transition of French regions from agriculture to industry in the 19th century.
The study establishes that the horse power of steam engines in industrial production in the 1860-1865
period had a positive and significant impact on income per capita in 1860, 1901 and 1930. In particular,
a one-percent increase in the total horse power of steam engines in a department in 1860-1865 increased
GDP per capita by 0.10 percent in 1860, 0.23 percent in 1901 and 0.10 percent in 1930. Nevertheless,
industrialization had an adverse effect on income per capita and human capital formation in the post-2000
period. In particular, a one-percent increase in the total horse power of steam engines in a department in
1860-1865 led to a 0.06 percent decrease in GDP per capita in 2001-2005.3
It is important to note that the IV estimation reverses the OLS estimates of the relationship between
industrialization and the long-run level of income per capita from a positive to a negative one. This reversal
suggests that factors which fostered industrial development, rather than industrialization per se, contributed
to the positive association between industrialization and long-run development. In particular, once one
accounts for the effect of these omitted factors, industrialization has an adverse effect on the standard
of living in the long-run. These findings suggest that the characteristics that permitted the early onset of
industrialization, rather than the adoption of industrial technology per se, have been the source of prosperity
among the currently developed economies that experienced an early industrialization.
The empirical analysis accounts for a wide range of exogenous confounding geographical and institutional characteristics, as well as for pre-industrial development, which may have contributed to the relationship between industrialization and economic development. First, it accounts for the potentially confounding
impact of exogenous geographical characteristics (i.e, latitude, land suitability, average temperature, average
rainfall and share of carboniferous area) of each French department on the relationship between industrialization and economic development. In particular, it captures the potential effect of these geographical
factors on the profitability of the adoption of the steam engine, the pace of its regional diffusion, as well as
on productivity and thus the evolution of income per capita in the process of development. Second, it captures the potentially confounding effects of the location of departments (i.e., border departments, maritime
departments, departments at a greater distance from the concentration of political power in Paris, and those
that were temporarily under German domination) on the diffusion of the steam engine and the diffusion of
development. Third, the analysis accounts for the differential level of development across France in the preindustrial era that may have affected jointly the process of development and the process of industrialization.
If one views each French department as a small open economy, one may argue that the proper industrial
policy ought to encourage the development of skilled-intensive sectors rather than of traditional unskilledintensive sectors. However, one concern could be that the negative effect of industrialization in the long-run,
at the departmental level, does not reflect the overall effect of industrialization. A priori, it is possible that
industrialization generated technological spillovers such that the most industrialized department within a
3 To put these figures in perspective, it must be borne in mind that Crafts (2004) finds that the contribution of steam
technology to labor productivity growth in Great Britain was equal to 0.41 percent per year over the 1850-1870 period and to
0.31 percent per year over the 1870-1910 period.

4

region declined but the region as a whole prospered due to the spillovers from the process of industrialization.
Nevertheless, further empirical analysis suggests that the negative impact of industrialization on long-run
prosperity in one department did not generate sufficiently positive spillovers in neighboring departments so
as to avert the adverse effects of industrialization on long-run prosperity of the region as a whole.
The research further explores the mediating channels through which earlier industrial development has
an adverse effect of the contemporary level of development. It suggests that the adverse effect of industrialization on long-run prosperity reflects the adverse effect of earlier specialization in unskilled-intensive
industries on human capital formation and the incentive to adopt skill-intensive technologies in the contemporary era. Industrialization has triggered a dual techno-cultural lock-in effect characterized by a reinforcing
interaction between technological inertia, reflected by the persistence predominance of low-skilled-intensive
industries and cultural inertia, in the form of a lower predisposition towards investment in human capital.
In particular, while the adoption of industrial technology was conducive for economic development in the
short-run, acquired comparative advantage in the unskilled-intensive industrial sector had triggered cultural
inertia, characterized by lower educational aspirations, that has hindered the transition to more lucrative
skilled-intensive sectors, adversely effecting human capital formation and the standards of living in the
long-run.
The dual technological-cultural lock-in effect is established using individual level data. Following the
epidemiological approach for the study of cultural persistence, the study exploits data on education achievements of over 2100 second generation migrants (i.e., individuals who live in their birth department and their
parents migrated from a different department within France). The analysis suggests that second generation
migrants whose parents were originated in historically industrial regions are significantly more likely to have
low human capital aspirations, as reflected by their acquisition of vocational education, accounting for the
department of birth fixed effects and for the parental occupation. The analysis of second-generation migrants
accounts for time invariant unobserved heterogeneity in the host department (e.g., geographical, cultural and
institutional characteristics), mitigating possible concerns about the confounding effect of host departmentspecific characteristics. Moreover, since the historical industrial intensity in the parental department of origin
is distinct from the historical industrial intensity in the respondent’s department of residence, the estimated
effect of industrial intensity in the parental department of origin on their human capital formation captures
the culturally-embodied, intergenerationally transmitted effect of industrial intensity on human capital aspirations, rather than the direct effect of industrial intensity. This result lend credence to the presence of
cultural inertia and technological inertia that have reinforced one another and triggered a dual lock-in effect.
Furthermore, using individual data on the composition of employment across sectors among over 1.1
million individuals, the study suggests that this cultural inertia, and its adverse effect on human capital
formation in the long-run, has further hindered the incentive of competitive industries to adopt more lucrative
skilled-intensive technologies, reinforcing the suboptimal level of human capital formation and reducing the
standards of living in the long-run. In particular, individuals who are currently residing in a department
that was characterized in the 1860-1865 survey by a higher horse power of steam engine are significantly less
likely to be employed in the skill-intensive R&D sector and are significantly more likely to be employed in
unskilled-intensive industrial sectors. These results lend credence to the argument that historical industrial
regions have experienced a technological lock-in effect. Namely, acquired comparative advantage in the
unskilled-intensive sector in early stages of industrialization is associated with the relative domination of
5

unskilled intensive firms and occupations.
The empirical analysis further establishes that various plausible channels do not account for the adverse
effect of early industrialization on long-run prosperity: (1) the contribution of industrialization to unionization and wage rates in historically industrialized regions and the comparative decline of these regions in the
long-run due to the incentive of modern industries to locate in regions where labor markets are more competitive, (2) the effect of trade protection in traditional industries on the decline in the long-run competitiveness
of historically industrialized regions, (3) the potential negative effect of disproportional destruction of industrialized regions during WWI and WWII on the subsequent development of these regions, (4) the persistent
ad- verse effect of selective migration (e.g. immigration of unskilled workers into industrialized regions, or the
emigration of more educated workers into less industrialized regions), on the composition of human capital
and long-run income per capita in historically industrialized regions, and (5) the disproportionate public
investment in human capital in non-industrial regions.

Data and Main Variables

France was among the first countries to industrialize in Europe in the 18th century and its industrialization
continued during the 19th century. Nevertheless, by 1914, the living standard in France remained below that
of England and of Germany, which had become the leading industrial country in continental Europe. The
slower path of industrialization in France has been attributed to the consequences of the French Revolution
(e.g., wars, legal reforms and land redistribution), the patterns of domestic and foreign investment, cultural
preferences for public services, as well as the comparative advantage of France in agriculture vis-a-vis England
and Germany (see the discussion in, e.g., Crouzet, 2003).
This section examines the evolution of industrialization and income across 89 French departments,
based on the administrative division of France in the 1860-1865 period, accounting for the geographical
and the institutional characteristics of these regions. The initial partition of the French territory in 1790
was designed to ensure that the travel distance by horse from any location within the department to the
main administrative center would not exceed one day. The initial territory of each department was therefore orthogonal to the process of development and the subsequent minor changes in the borders of some
departments did not reflect the effect of industrialization.
In light of the changes in the internal and external boundaries of the French territory during the period
of study, the number of departments that is included in different stages of the analysis varies from 81 to
89. In particular, several departments that were split into smaller units are aggregated into their historical
territorial borders and regions that were temporarily removed from the French territory are excluded from
the analysis during those time periods.4 Table A.1 reports the descriptive statistics for the variables in the
empirical analysis across these departments.
4 The Parisian region encompassed three departments (Seine, Seine-et-Marne and Seine-et-Oise) before 1968 and it was
split into eight (Essonne, Hauts-de-Seine, Paris, Seine-et-Marne, Seine-Saint-Denis, Val-de-Marne, Val d’Oise and Yvelines)
afterwards. Likewise, the Corsica department was split in 1975 into Corse-du-Sud and Haute-Corse. The three departments
(i.e., Bas-Rhin, Haut-Rhin and Meurthe) which were under German rule between 1871 and 1918 are excluded from the analysis
of economic development over that time period. In addition, in the examination of the robustness of the analysis with data
prior to 1860, the three departments (i.e., Alpes-Maritimes, Haute-Savoie and Savoie) that were not part of France are excluded
from the analysis.

2.1.1

Past and Present Measures of Income, Workforce and Human Capital
Income

This study seeks to examine the effect of industrialization on the evolution of income per capita in the process
of development. Given that the industrial survey which is the basis for our analysis was conducted between
1860 and 1865, the relevant data to capture the short-run and medium-run effects of industrialization on
income per capita are provided at the departmental level prior to WWII for the years 1860, 1872, 1886,
1901, 1911 and 1930 by Combes et al. (2011) and Caruana-Galizia (2013). Thus, for the sake of brevity,
and equal spacing between those years, the analysis focuses on income per capita in 1860, 1901 and 1930.
To assess the effects of industrialization on income per capita in the long-run, the analysis is restricted to
the 2001-2005 period (INSEE - Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques).5 Moreover, to
lessen the potential impact of fluctuations in income per capita, the effect of industrialization in the long-run
is captured by its differential impact on the average GDP per capita across departments over the 2001-2005
period.
2.1.2

Workforce

The effect of industrialization on the sectoral composition of the workforce in the post-1860 period is captured
by the impact on the shares of employment in the agricultural, industrial and service sectors. The surveys
which capture the short-run and mid-run effects of industrialization are those undertaken in 1861, 1901 and
1930 (Statistique Générale de la France). Similarly, to assess the effects of industrialization on the sectoral
composition in the post-WWII period, all available surveys of the French population across departments
(i.e., 1968, 1975, 1982, 1990, 1999 and 2010) are used (INSEE - Institut National de la Statistique et des
Etudes Economiques).
Furthermore, the analysis of the underlying mechanism uses individual data from the Déclaration
Annuelle de Donnés Sociales in 2008 which provides representative information on 1.1 million private sector
workers, except for the self-employed. This dataset enables us to determine whether individuals are more
likely to work in firms where the demand for human capital is high (i.e., scientific research & development)
or low (i.e., coal industries or machine repair.) In addition, the analysis relies on the 2005 survey Enquête
Emploi conducted by the INSEE regarding the job prospects of employed and unemployed individuals. This
survey provides information on the respondents’ birthplace as well as those of their parents. As such, it
enables us to focus on second generation migrants (i.e., individuals who were born and still live in their
birth department, but whose parents were born in a different department). In the analysis, these second
generation migrants are matched to the horse power of steam engines of their mother’s birth department,
their father’s birth department, as well as to the birth department of their parents if both of them were born
in the same department.
5 Data on income per capita at the departmental level is only available in the post-1995 period and the corresponding
data for the other indicators of the standards of living only in the post-2001 period. Note that the qualitative results remain
unchanged if one considers the average income per capita over the entire sample period available, 1995-2010.

7

2.1.3

Human Capital

The study further explores the effect of industrialization on the evolution of human capital in the process of
development. The effect of industrialization on human capital formation in the pre-WWI period is captured
by its impact on the literacy rates of French army conscripts (i.e., 20-year-old men who reported for military
service in the department where their father lived - Annuaire Statistique De La France (1878-1939)). In
particular, given the data limitations, the analysis focuses on the share of the literate conscripts over the
1874-1883 and 1894-1903 decades. As reported in Table A.1, 82.0% of the French conscripts were literate
over the 1874-1883 period and 94.1% over the 1894-1903 period.6
The effect of industrialization on human capital formation in the post-WWII period is captured by
its impact on the share of men and women (age 25 and above) who completed a post-secondary degree
(in a vocational school or in an university) as reported in the available surveys of the French population
across departments (i.e., 1968, 1975, 1982, 1990, 1999 and 2010). As can be seen in Table A.1, there was
a continuous increase in the educational achievements of the French population during this period. Indeed
the shares of men and women (age 25 and above) who completed high-school, respectively, rose from 8.8%
and 6.0% in 1968 to 36.3% and 39.1% in 2010.
Furthermore, to examine the role of the composition of human capital in the non-monotonic evolution
of income per capita, the study explores the impact of industrialization on the evolution of high-, mediumand low-levels of human capital in France after WWII . This composition is captured by the division of the
workforce (age 25-54) between executives and other intellectual professions, middle management professionals, and employees, in the available surveys of the French population across departments (1968, 1975, 1982,
1990, 1999 and 2010).
Moreover, to capture the effect of industrialization on human capital formation in the contemporary
period, in which school attendance is mandatory until the age of 16, the study explores its impact on
the shares of men and women in the 15-17 and 18-24 age categories attending school or any other (postsecondary) learning institution as reported in the 2010 census. As indicated in Table A.1, in 2010, most men
and women age 15-17 (respectively 95.5% and 96.7%) attended school but fewer (44.3% and 48.0%) pursued
post-secondary studies.
Finally, to capture the general willingness of the local population to invest in human capital, we use
individual data from a 2001 survey pertaining to the importance that individuals attribute to science and
scientific research (Centre de recherches politiques de Sciences Po, Enquête science 2001). Out of the various
questions, we single out two where individuals are asked whether they have an interest in science or not, and
whether they use science in their current work.

2.2

Steam Engines

The research explores the effect of the introduction of industrial technology on the process of development.
In light of the pivotal role played by the steam engine in the process of industrialization, it exploits variations
in the industrial use of the steam engine across the French regions during its early stages of industrialization
6 In line with the historical evidence (e.g., Grew and Harrigan, 1991), as reported in Table A.1, a sizeable share of the
French population was literate even before the passing of the 1881-1882 laws which made primary school attendance “free”and
mandatory for boys and girls until age 13.

to capture the intensity of industrialization. In particular, the analysis focuses on the horse power of steam
engines used in each French department as reported in the industrial survey carried out by the French
government between 1860 and 1865.7

Figure 2: The distribution of the total horse power of steam engines across departments in France, 1860-1865.

As depicted in Figure 2, and analyzed further in the discussion of the identification strategy in Section
3, the unequal distribution of the steam engines across French departments in 1860-1865 suggests a regional
pattern of diffusion from Fresnes-sur-Escaut (in the Nord department, at the northern tip of continental
France) where a steam engine was first successfully operated for commercial and industrial purposes in
France from 1732 onwards. The most intensive use of the steam engine over this period was in the Northern
part of France. The intensity diminished somewhat in the East and in the South East, and declined further
in the South West. Three departments had no steam engine in 1860-1865 (i.e., Ariège and Lot in the
South-West and Hautes-Alpes in the South-East). Potential anomalies associated with these departments
are accounted for by the introduction of a dummy variable that represents them. In particular, potential
concerns about the distance of these departments from the threshold level of development that permits the
adoption of the steam engines is accounted for by this dummy variable.
Table A.6 reports descriptive statistics for the horse power of steam engines in each of the 16 sectors
listed in the 1860-1865 survey: ceramics, chemistry, clothing, construction, food, furniture, leather, lighting,
luxury goods, metal objects, metallurgy, mines, sciences & arts, textile, transportation and wood. It shows
that the five sectors with the largest mean horse power per department are textile, metallurgy, mines, food
industry and metal objects. In particular, the textile sector had the largest average horse power of all the
7 The 1860-1865 survey is the second industrial survey undertaken in France which was published by the French government:
it provides the horse power of steam engines but not the number of steam engines. Conversely, the first industrial survey, which
was carried out in 1839-1847, indicates the number of steam engines but not the horse power of the steam engines. Below, we
establish the robustness of the results to using the 1839-1847 data, as well data from 1897.

sectors and 43% more horse power than metallurgy, the sector with the second largest mean horse power.
Moreover, using the descriptive statistics on the number of workers in each of the 16 sectors reported in Table
A.6 that the textile sector has a smaller ratio of steam engine horse power per worker than the metallurgy,
mining and food sectors, most likely because not all the activities of the textile sector required steam engines.

Confounding Characteristics of each Department

The empirical analysis accounts for a wide range of exogenous confounding geographical and institutional
characteristics, as well as for pre-industrial development, which may have contributed to the relationship
between industrialization and economic development. Institutions may have affected jointly the process of
development and the process of industrialization. Geographical characteristics may have impacted the pace
of industrialization as well as agricultural productivity and thus income per capita. Moreover, geographical
and institutional factors may have affected the process of development indirectly by governing the pace of
the diffusion of steam engines across departments. Finally, pre-industrial development may have affected the
onset of industrialization and may have had an independent persistent effect on the process of development.
2.3.1

Geographic Characteristics

The empirical analysis accounts for the potentially confounding impact of exogenous geographical characteristics of each of the French departments on the relationship between industrialization and economic
development. In particular, it captures the potential effect of these geographical factors on the profitability
of the adoption of the steam engine, the pace of its regional diffusion, as well as on productivity and thus
the evolution of income per capita in the process of development.

Figure 3: Geographic characteristics of French departments

First, the study accounts for climatic and soil characteristics of each department mapped in Figure 3
(i.e., land suitability, average temperature, average rainfall, and latitude (Ramankutty et al., 2002; Luterbacher et al., 2004, 2006; Pauling et al., 2006)), that could have affected natural land productivity and
therefore the feasibility and profitability of the transition to the industrial stage of development, as well as
the evolution of aggregate productivity in each department. Moreover, the diffusion of the steam engine
10

across French departments as well as the process of development could have been affected by the presence of
raw material required for industrialization. Our regressions thus account for the share of carboniferous area
in each department (Fernihough and O’Rourke, 2014).
Second, the analysis captures the confounding effect of the location of each department on the diffusion
of development from nearby regions or countries, as well as its effect on the regional diffusion of the steam
engine. In particular, it accounts for the effect of the latitude of each department, border departments
(i.e., positioned along the border with Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Spain), and
maritime departments (i.e., positioned along the sea shore of France) on the pace of this diffusion process.
It also accounts for the presence of rivers and their main tributaries within the perimeter of the department
by using data on the paths of the Rhine, Loire, Meuse, Rhône, Seine and Garonne rivers as well as of their
major tributaries (Dordogne, Charente and Escaut).
Finally, the research accounts for the potential differential effects of international trade on process of
development as well as on the adoption the steam engine. In particular, it captures the potential effect of
maritime departments (i.e., those departments that are positioned along the sea shore of France), via trade,
on the diffusion of the steam engine and thus on economic development as well as the effect of trade on the
evolution of income per capita over this time period.
2.3.2

Institutional Characteristics

The analysis deals with the effect of variations in the adoption of the steam engine across French departments
on their comparative development. This empirical strategy ensures that institutional factors that were unique
to France as a whole over this time period are not the source of the differential pattern of development
across these regions. Nevertheless, two regions of France over this time period had a unique exposure to
institutional characteristics that may have contributed to the observed relationship between industrialization
and economic development.
First, the emergence of state centralization in France, centuries prior to the process of industrialization,
and the concentration of political power in Paris, may have affected differentially the political culture and
economic prosperity in Paris and its suburbs (i.e., Seine, Seine-et-Marne and Seine-et-Oise). Hence, the
empirical analysis includes a dummy variable for these three departments, accounting for their potential
confounding effects on the observed relationship between industrialization and economic development, in
general, and the adoption of the steam engine, in particular. Moreover, the analysis captures the potential
decline in the grip of the central government in regions at a greater distance from Paris, and the diminished
potential diffusion of development into these regions, accounting for the effect of the aerial distance between
the administrative center of each department and Paris.
Second, the relationship between industrialization and development in the Alsace-Lorraine region (i.e.,
the Bas-Rhin, Haut-Rhin and the Moselle departments) that was under German domination in the 1871-1918
period may represent the persistence of institutional and economic characteristics that reflected their unique
experience.8 Hence, the empirical analysis includes a dummy variable for these regions, accounting for the
8 Differences in the welfare laws and labor market regulations in Alsace-Lorraine and the rest of France persisted throughout
most of the 20th century. Moreover the laws on the separation of Church and State are different, and these differences were
reaffirmed by a decision of the Supreme French Constitutional Court in 2013 (Decision 2012-297 QPC, 21 February 2013).

confounding effects of the characteristics of the region.
2.3.3

Pre-Industrial Development

The differential level of development across France in the pre-industrial era may have affected jointly the
subsequent process of development and the process of industrialization. In particular, it may have affected
the adoption of the steam engine and it may have generated, independently, a persistent effect on the process
of development. Hence, the empirical analysis accounts for the potentially confounding effects of the level of
development in the pre-industrial period, more than 150 years prior to the 1860-1865 industrial survey. This
early level of development is captured by the degree of urbanization (i.e., population of urban centers with
more than 10,000 inhabitants) in each French department in 1700 as well as by the presence of a university
in 1700 and 1793.9

Empirical Methodology
Empirical Strategy

The observed relationship between industrialization and economic development is not necessarily indicative
of the causal effect of industrialization on economic prosperity. It may reflect the impact of economic development on the process of industrialization as well as the influence of institutional, geographical, cultural
and human capital characteristics on the joint evolution of process of development and the onset of industrialization. In light of the endogeneity of industrialization and economic development, this research exploits
geographic and climatic sources of regional variation in the diffusion and adoption of steam engines across
France to establish the effect of industrialization on the process of development.
The identification strategy consists of two distinct components that govern: (i) the regional diffusion
and thus the supply of industrial technologies, and (ii) the differential decline in the profitability of agriculture
across regions and thus variations in the pace of industrialization as well as in the demand for industrials
technologies.
3.1.1

The Diffusion of the Steam Engines from Fresnes-sur-Escaut

The first component of the identification strategy is motivated by the historical account of the gradual
regional diffusion of the steam engine in France during the 18th and 19th century (Ballot, 1923; Sée, 1925;
Léon, 1976). Considering the positive association between industrialization and the intensity in the use of
the steam engine (Mokyr, 1990; Bresnahan and Trajtenberg, 1995; Rosenberg and Trajtenberg, 2004), the
study takes advantage of the regional diffusion of the steam engine to identify the effect of local variations
in the intensity of the use of the steam engine during the 1860-1865 period on the process of development.
In particular, it exploits the distances between each French department and Fresnes-sur-Escaut (in the Nord
department), where the first successful commercial and industrial application of the steam engine in France
9 The qualitative analysis remains intact if the potential effect of past population density is accounted for as we show in
Section 4.2.2.

12

was made in 1732, as an instrument for the use of the steam engines in 1860-1865.10
Consistent with the diffusion hypothesis, the second steam engine in France that was utilized for
commercial purposes was operated in 1737 in the mines of Anzin, also in the Nord department, less than
10 km away from Fresnes-sur-Escaut. Furthermore, in the subsequent decades till the French Revolution
the commercial use of the steam engine expanded predominantly to the nearby northern and north-western
regions. Nevertheless, at the onset of the French revolution in 1789, steam engines were less widespread in
France than in England. A few additional steam engines were introduced until the fall of the Napoleonic
Empire in 1815, notably in Saint-Quentin in 1803 and in Mulhouse in 1812, but it is only after 1815 that
the diffusion of steam engines in France accelerated (Sée, 1925; Léon, 1976).

Notes: This table presents the results of OLS regression analysis of the geographical diffusion of the steam engine across departments in France, as captured
by the negative association between the log number of horse power of steam engines used in the department in 1860-1865 and the distance of the department
(in kilometers) from the location of the first commercial use of the steam engine in France – Fresnes-sur-Escaut. The regressions accounts for a range of
geographical, institutional, and pre-industrial characteristic. All regressions include a dummy variable for the three departments which had no steam engine
in 1860-1865. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are reported in brackets. *** denotes statistical significance at the 1%-level, ** at the 5%-level, * at
the 10%-level, for two-sided hypothesis tests.

Indeed, in line with the historical account, the unequal distribution of steam engines across French
departments, as reported in the 1860-1865 industrial survey, is indicative of a local diffusion process from
Fresnes-sur-Escaut. As reported in Column 1 of Table 1, there is a highly significant negative correlation
between the aerial distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut to the administrative center of each department and
the intensity of the use of steam engines in the department. Nevertheless, as discussed in Section 2.3, preindustrial development and a wide range of confounding geographical and institutional characteristics may
10 This steam engine was used to pump water in an ordinary mine of Fresnes-sur-Escaut. It is unclear whether Pierre Mathieu,
the owner of the mine, built the engine himself after a trip in England or employed an Englishman for this purpose (Ballot,
1923, p.385).

have contributed to the adoption of the steam engine. Reassuringly, the unconditional negative relationship
remains highly significant and is larger in absolute value when exogenous confounding geographical controls
(i.e., land suitability, latitude, rainfall and temperature) (Column 2), as well as institutional factors (Column
3) and pre-industrial development (Column 4), are accounted for. In particular, the findings suggest that
pre-industrial development, as captured by the degree of urbanization in each department in 1700 and
the characteristics that may have brought this early prosperity, had a persistent positive and significant
association with the adoption of the steam engine.11 Importantly, the diffusion pattern of steam engines is
not significantly correlated with the distance between Paris and the administrative center of each department
when the distance from Fresnes to each department’s administrative center is excluded from the analysis
(Column 5). Moreover, Column 6 of Table 1 and Figure 4 indicate that, when the distance to Paris is
accounted for, there is still a highly significant negative correlation between the distance from Fresnes-surEscaut to the administrative center of each department and the intensity of the use of steam engines in the
department.

Figure 4: The geographical diffusion of the steam engine − the negative relationship between the distance from Fresnes-surEscaut and the intensity in the use of the steam engine.
Notes: This figure depicts the partial conditional regression line of the association between distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut and the
horse power in steam engines in each French department in 1860-1865, accounting for geographic and institutional characteristics, as
well as for pre-industrial development.

The validity of the aerial distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut as an instrumental variable for the intensity
of the adoption of steam engines across France is enhanced by third additional factors. First, Table 2
establishes that, conditional on the distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut, distances between each department
and major centers of economic power in 1860-1865 are uncorrelated with the intensive use of the steam engine
over this period. In particular, conditional on the distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut, distances between each
department and Marseille and Lyon (the largest cities in France after Paris), Rouen (a major harbor in the
north-west where the steam engine was introduced in 1796), Mulhouse (a major city in the east where the
11 Conceivably, human capital in the pre-industrial area could have affected the adoption of the steam engine, as well as the
subsequent process of development. Nevertheless, in light of the scarcity of data on reliable human capital for the pre-industrial
period, the baseline analysis does not account for this confounding factor. Instead, Section 4.2.3 shows the robustness of the
results to the inclusion of pre-industrial levels of human capital for a smaller set of departments.

steam engine was introduced in 1812), and Bordeaux (a major harbor in the south-west) are uncorrelated
with the adoption of the steam engine, lending credence to the unique role of Fresnes-sur-Escaut and the
introduction of the first steam engine in this location in the diffusion of the steam engine across France.12
Table 2 further establishes that conditional on the distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut, distances between each
department and London and Berlin (i.e., the capitals of England and Germany which were the other two
largest industrial economies in Europe in the 19th century) are uncorrelated with the use of the steam engine
within France.

Notes: This table establishes that the negative association between the log number of horse power of steam engines used in the department in 1860-1865 and
the distance of the department (in kilometers) from the location of the first commercial use of the steam engine in France – Fresnes-sur-Escaut, is unaffected
by distances from other major cities in France the capital of England and Germany. All regressions include a dummy variable for the three departments which
had no steam engine in 1860-1865. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are reported in brackets. *** denotes statistical significance at the 1%-level,
** at the 5%-level, * at the 10%-level, for two-sided hypothesis tests.

Second, the distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut is uncorrelated with economic development across France
in the pre-industrial period. Unlike the highly significant negative relationship between the distance from
Fresnes-sur-Escaut and the intensity of the use of the steam engine in 1860-1865, Table 3 and Figure 5
establish that the distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut was uncorrelated with urban development and human
capital formation in the pre-industrial era. In particular, Column 1 in Table 3 shows that urbanization
rates in 1700 are uncorrelated with the distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut. Column 4 establishes that literacy
rates in the pre-industrial period, as captured by the share of grooms who could sign their marriage license
in 1686-1690, are uncorrelated with the distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut. Finally, Column 7 demonstrates
that there is no significant relationship between the presence of a university in 1700 and the distance from
Fresnes-sur-Escaut.13 Moreover, Table 3 and Figure 5 establish that the distance to Fresnes is not a predictor
of development in the 18th century, as captured by urbanization rates in 1780 and changes in urbanization
between 1700 and 1780 (Columns 2 and 3), literacy in 1786-1790 and changes in literacy between 1686-90
12 As reported in Table B.1, the use of an alternative measure of distances based on the time needed for a surface travel
between any pair of locations (Özak, 2010) does not affect the qualitative results.
13 It should be noted that these pre-industrial measures of development are highly correlated with income per-capita in the
post-industrialized period. For instance, the urban population in 1700 is positively correlated with all our measures of GDP
per capita in 1860 (0.570), 1901 (0.293), 1930 (0.551) and 2001-2005 (0.517).

rate in 1686-90, 1786-90 and its growth between these periods; the probability of presence of a university in 1700, 1793, and the change in this probability
over this period). Geographic characteristics include the department’s latitude, land suitability, average rainfall and temperature, share of carboniferous
area, distance to Paris and dummies for the presence of rivers and tributaries, maritime and border departments. Institutional measures include dummies
for Alsace-Lorraine and for Paris and its suburbs. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are reported in brackets. *** denotes statistical significance at
the 1%-level, ** at the 5%-level, * at the 10%-level, for two-sided hypothesis tests.

Third, it appears that the Nord department had neither superior human capital characteristics nor
higher standard of living in comparison to the average department in France. An imperfect measure of literacy
16

(i.e., grooms who could sign their wedding contract over the 1686-1690 period) prior to the introduction of
the first steam engine in 1732, suggests that if anything, Nord’s literacy rate was below the French average.
Specifically, only 10.45% of men in Nord could sign their wedding contract over the 1686-1690 period while
the average for the rest of France was 26.10% (with a standard deviation of 14.86%) (Furet and Ozouf,
1977). Furthermore, using height as an indicator for the standard of living suggests that the standard living
in Flanders, the province of the French kingdom prior to 1789 which contained Fresnes-sur-Escaut, was
nearly identical to that of the rest of France (Komlos, 2005).14 As depicted in Figure G.2 in the Appendix,
variations in the average height of French army soldiers from Flanders over the 1700-65 period were not
different from those of the soldiers from other parts of France.
3.1.2

Temperature Shocks and the Transition from Agriculture to Industry

The second component of the identification strategy exploits regional variations in temperature deviations
(on the eve of the industrial survey) from their historical trend to capture exogenous sources of variation
in the profitability of agriculture and therefore in the pace of industrialization and the demand for steam
engine technologies across departments. In particular, in order to capture the changes in the profitability
of agriculture production in the eve of the 1860-1865 industrial survey on the adoption of steam engines
across departments, the analysis exploits regional variations in the squared deviations of fall temperatures
in the 1856-1859 period from the average fall temperature, over the earlier 25-year period (1831-1855).15
Temporary temperature deviations and their adverse effect on the supply and the stock of crops have a
significant positive effect on the prices of the dominating crops in the subsequent years, but no longer on the
productivity in the agricultural sector, and they diminish therefore the disincentive to reallocate resources
from the agricultural to the industrial sector.
Let T̃i,1856−1859,(25) be the squared deviation of fall temperatures in the 1856-1859 period in department
i from its average fall temperatures over the preceding 25-year period, 1831-1855.
T̃i,1856−1859,(25) ≡ [µi,1856−1859 − µi,1831−1855 ]2

(1)

where µi,1856−1859 is the average fall temperature over the 1856-1859 period and µi,1831−1855 is the average
fall temperature in the 1831-1855 baseline period.
Panel A of Figure 6 displays the average fall temperature in 1856-1859 across the French departments
while Panel B of Figure 6 depicts the squared deviation in average fall temperature in the 1856-1859 period,
using 1831-1855 as the baseline period, i.e., the T̃i,1856−1859,(25) variable.
14 Concerns regarding selection bias suggest that the height of soldiers may not always be representative of the height of the
general population (see, e.g., Baten, 2000) but there is no reason to think that this selection bias would be more or less intense
in Flanders than in the rest of France.
15 Unlike temperature deviations over the fall season, as established in Table B.3, temperature deviations in other seasons,
as well as rainfall deviations in the fall (and other seasons), do not have a significant effect on the adoption of steam engines.
Spring wheat – the dominant crop in France over this period – was harvested in late summer and early fall, and its grains
that were stored for planting in the spring were particularly sensitive to high temperature in the fall that affected their ability
to germinate over time. The harvest of wine grapes –the second dominating crop – took place over the entire fall season and
was directly sensitive to temperature during this season. Finally, other important crops, barely, oat, and corn, completed their
harvest in the early part of the fall and the deprecation of their stored grains was sensitive to the fall temperature as well.

Note: This table establishes the first stage of our estimation strategy where we relate the log of the horse power of steam engines to the distance from
Fresnes-sur-Escaut and temperature deviations over the 1856-1859 period. The relationship is shown to be robust to three baseline periods, i.e, 1831-1855,
1841-1855 and 1806-1855. The dependent variable is in logarithm. Geographic characteristics include the department’s latitude, land suitability, average
rainfall and temperature, share of carboniferous area, distance to Paris as well as dummies for the presence of rivers and tributaries, maritime and border
departments. Institutional measures include dummies for Alsace-Lorraine and for Paris and its suburbs. Pre-industrial development characteristics include
a measure of the urban population in 1700. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are reported in brackets. *** indicates significance at the 1%-level, **
at the 5%-level, * at the 10%-level.

Table 4 suggests that, accounting for geographic and institutional characteristics, the horse power of
steam engines across French departments in 1860-1865 is negatively associated with the squared deviation
in fall temperature in 1856-1859 period, where the historical trend is computed over the 1831-1855 period
(Column (1), and as shown in Figure 7), the 1841-1855 period (Column (2)) and the 1806-1855 period
(Column (3)). Moreover, this negative association remains significant once we account for the Distance from
Fresnes (Columns (4)-(6)).16

Figure 7: Temperature deviations and the intensity in the use of the steam engine.
Notes: This figure depicts the partial unconditional regression line of the association between temperature deviations over the 1856-1859
on the 1831-1855 baseline and the horse power in steam engines in each French department in 1860-1865.

Tables B.3 and B.4 in the Appendix provide falsification tests in support of the causal impact of the
squared deviation of fall temperature in 1856-1859 period from the 1831-1855 baseline period. Table B.3
shows that temperature deviations in the spring, summer and winter of 1856-1859 do not have a significant
impact of the adoption of steam engines in 1860-1865 beyond the one captured by temperature deviations in
the fall. It also shows that the squared deviation of rainfall in fall 1856-1859 has no impact. More importantly,
Table B.4 shows that temperature deviations in other time intervals before the 1860-1865 industrial survey
(i.e., 1844-1847, 1848-1851 and 1852-1855) or afterwards (i.e., 1866-1869 and 1870-1873) are not correlated
with the horse power of steam engines in 1860-1865.
Since temperature deviations from their historical trend are likely to be associated with reductions in
crop yields, and consequently higher crop prices, temperature deviations are likely to delay the transition
to industry. Indeed, Table B.5 in the Appendix demonstrates that the effect of temperature deviations
on steam engine adoption is operating through the profitability of agricultural production as captured by
wheat prices. Columns (1) and (2) establish that average temperature deviations in the fall of 1856-1859 are
associated with higher wheat prices in the fall of 1856-1859, relative to the 1831-1855 baseline level. Column
(4) suggests that higher wheat prices are indeed associated with a lesser adoption of the steam engine and
Column (5) demonstrates that the effect of temperature deviations on the adoption of steam engines is partly
mediated through the rise in wheat prices. Temperature deviations in the fall are also highly correlated with
wheat prices in the year as a whole as shown in Table B.6.17 Nevertheless, since planting decisions are likely
to be based on wheat prices during the harvest period in the fall, the adverse effect of wheat prices in the fall
to south west orientation, the correlation coefficient between the two instruments is low and equal to -0.0183 and the OLS
regression in Column (1) of Table B.2 of Distance to Fresnes on Temperature Deviations provides a negative and insignificant
coefficient. Furthermore, if one nets out a possible common orientation of the two instruments, and uses the residual from
regression one instrument over the other as an instrumental variable, as established in Table B.2, the results are even stronger
economically and statistically.
17 Supplementary regressions show that wheat prices in each individual month of September, October and November are
also correlated with temperature deviations in the fall. However these monthly wheat prices have no significant effect on the
adoption of steam engines.

19

on the transition to industry is more pronounced when wheat prices in the fall are considered. Furthermore,
while temperature deviations have a significant impact on wheat prices in 1856-1859, Table B.7 establishes
that, conditional on temperature deviations in the fall, rainfall deviations in any of the four seasons do not
have a significant association with wheat prices over this time period.18
Interestingly, while temperature deviations in the period that preceded the 1856-1859 period had no
effect on the intensity of industrialization in 1860-1865, Table B.8 establishes that temperature deviations
in the 1856-1859 period and their impact on the horse power of steam engines in 1860-1865 had generated a
technological head-start in these departments that persisted over time. Namely, as demonstrated in Column
(1), temperatures deviations in 1856-1859 and their positive impact on the incentives to remain in the
agricultural sector, are negatively and significantly associated with the horse power of steam engines in the
later industrial survey of 1897. However, as demonstrated in Column (2), this adverse effect operates through
the persistent effect of the intensity of industrialization in each department in 1860-1865, rather than the
lingering effect of past tempreture deviations on crop prices decades later.
3.1.3

Determinants of the Adoption of the Steam Engine

Accounting for the confounding effects of geographical, institutional and pre-industrial characteristics, Column (4) in Table 4 reports the significant negative relationship between the horse power of steam engines and
the instrumental variables: (i) the distance from Fresnes and (ii) the squared deviation of fall temperatures
in the 1856-1859 period from their historical trend over the 1831-1855 period. In particular, Column (4) of
Table 4 shows that accounting for confounding geographical and institutional characteristics, pre-industrial
development, distances from major economic centers as well as temperature deviations from their historical
trend, a 100-km increase in the distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut is associated with a 0.73 decrease in the log
of horse power of steam engines in a department. unit increase in the squared deviation of temperatures in
the period 1856-1859 from the average temperature over the 1831-1855 period is associated with a 4.48-point
decrease in the log of horse power of steam engines in a department. In particular, if the distance of a
department away from Fresnes-sur-Escaut was to increase from the 40th (426 km) to the 60th percentile
(559 km) of the distance distribution, this department would experience an aggregate drop of 275 in the
horse power of steam engines (relative to a sample mean of 1839.35 hp).
Moreover, regional variations in temperature deviations from their historical trend is associated with
regional variation in the profitability of agriculture (as reflected by wheat prices), and in the adoption of
steam engines. In particular, conditional on the distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut, a one-unit increase in the
squared deviation of temperatures in the period 1856-1859 from the average temperature over the 1831-1855
period is associated with a 4.48-point decrease in the log of horse power of steam engines in a department.
As such, in comparison to a department at the 40th percentile of the squared temperature deviation (i.e.,
0.14), a department with a 60th percentile of the squared temperature deviation (i.e., 0.25), will be expected
to experience a drop of 13.9 in the horse power of steam engines.
These estimated effects suggest that the diffusion of the steam engine as well the transition from
agriculture to industry contributed to the adoption of steams engines. Nevertheless, the qualitative results
18 It should be noted that rainfall deviations in each season have no significant effect on the adoption of steam engines,
accounting for the instruments Distance to Fresnes and Temperature Deviations.

20

remain unchanged if either one of the two instruments are used separately as shown by Tables B.9 and B.10
in the Appendix.
Finally, the highly significant negative effect of (i) the distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut to the administrative center of each department and of (ii) the deviation of fall temperature in 1856-1859 from their
baseline level on the horse power of steam engines in each department in 1860-1865 is robust to the inclusion
of an additional set of confounding geographical, demographic and institutional characteristics, as well as
to the forces of pre-industrial development, which as discussed in section 4.2, may have contributed to the
relationship between industrialization and economic development. As established in Table B.11 in the Appendix, these confounding factors, which could be largely viewed as endogenous to the adoption of the steam
engine and are thus not considered as part of the baseline analysis, do not affect the qualitative results.

3.2

Empirical Model

The effect of early industrialization on the entire subsequent process of development is estimated using 2SLS.
The second stage provides a cross-section estimate of the relationship between the total horse power of steam
engines in each department in 1860-1865 to measures of income per capita, human capital formation and
other economic outcomes at different points in time;
Yit = α + βEi + Xi0 ω + εit ,

(2)

where Yit represents one measure of economic outcomes in department i in year t, E i is the log of total
horse power of steam engines in department i in 1860-1865, Xi0 is a vector of geographical, institutional and
pre-industrial economic characteristics of department i and it is an i.i.d. error term for department i in
year t.19
In the first stage, E i , the log of total horse power of steam engines in department i in 1860-1865 is
instrumented by D i , the aerial distance (in kilometers) between the administrative center of department
i and Fresnes-sur-Escaut, as well as by T̃i,1856−1859,(25) , the squared deviation of fall temperatures in the
1856-1859 period in department i from the average fall temperatures over the preceding 25-year period,
1831-1855;
Ei = δ1 Di + δ2 T̃i,1856−1859,(25) + Xi0 δ3 + µi ,
(3)
where Xi0 is the same vector of geographical, institutional and pre-industrial economic characteristics of
department i used in the second stage, and µi is an error term for department i.

Industrialization and the Evolution of the Standard of Living
Industrialization and the Dynamics of Income per Capita

The study examines the effect of the intensity in the use of steam engines in the 1860-1865 period on
the evolution of income per capita in the process of development. As established in Tables 5 and 6, and
19 The early industrial survey of 1839-1847 is not comparable to the 1860-1865 survey since it does not account for the horse
power of steam engine.

depicted in Figure 8, consistently with the proposed hypothesis, industrialization was conducive for economic
development in the short-run and in the medium-run but had a detrimental effect on standards of living in
the long-run.20 In particular, the horse power of steam engines in industrial production in the 1860-1865
period had a positive and significant impact on income per capita in 1860, 1901 and 1930 but a negative and
significant effect on income per capita during the 2001-2005 period.

Note: This figure displays the estimated coefficients of Horse Power of Steam Engines in the IV regressions in Columns 5 and 10 of
Tables 5 and 6. Intervals reflect 95%-confidence levels.

The relationship between industrialization and income per capita in the short-run and in the mediumrun is presented in Table 5 and in the first five Columns of Table 6. As shown in Columns (1) and (6) in Table
5 and in Column (1) in Table 6, unconditionally, the horse power of steam engines in industrial production in
the 1860-1865 period had a highly significant positive association with income per capita in 1860, 1901 and
1930. Moreover, this relationship remains positive, although somewhat smaller and less significant, once one
progressively accounts for the confounding effects of exogenous geographical factors (Columns (2) and (7) in
Table 5 and Column (2) in Table 6), institutional factors (Columns (3) and (8) in Table 5 and Column (3)
in Table 6) and pre-industrial characteristics (Columns (4) and (9) in Table 5 and Column (4) in Table 6).
Finally, mitigating the effect of omitted variables on the observed relationship, the IV estimation in Columns
(5), (10) and (11) in Table 5 suggests that the horse power of steam engines in 1860-1865 had a positive
and significant impact on income per capita in 1860 and 1901, accounting for the confounding effects of
geographical, institutional, and demographic characteristics. We also note that the effect of industrialization
in 1860-1865 on log GDP per capita in 1930 is still positive and significant in Column (5) of Table 6 but that
this effect is not significant anymore (although still positive) when we include log GDP per capita in 1860
as an additional control variable in Column (6). A one-percent increase in the total horse power of steam
engines in a department in 1860-1865 increased GDP per capita by 0.102 percent in 1860, 0.231 in 1901
and 0.099 percent in 1930. As such, if a department had increased its total horse power of steam engines
20 Given data limitation on income per capita across departments in the post-industrial survey period (as elaborated in
section 2), the immediate effect of industrialization on income per capita is captured by its impact in 1860, its short-run effect
by its impact in 1901, its medium-run effect by its impact in 1930, while its long-run effect is captured by its impact on the
average level of income per capita across departments over the 2001-2005 period.

Note: This table presents OLS and IV regressions relating the horse power of steam engines in 1860-1865 to log GDP per capita in 1860 and 1901. All
regressions include a dummy variable for the three departments which had no steam engine in 1860-1865. The Alsace-Lorraine variable is omitted from the
regressions since the Alsace-Lorraine region was not part of France between 1871 and 1914. Aerial distances are measured in kilometers. Other explanatory
variables, except the dummies, and the dependent variables are in logarithm. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are reported in brackets. *** indicates
significance at the 1%-level, ** at the 5%-level, * at the 10%-level.

in 1860-1865 from the 40th percentile (380 hp) to the 60th percentile (762 hp) of the distribution, it would
have experienced an increase in GDP per capita of 10.25 percent in 1860, 23.22 percent in 1901 and 10.04
percent in 1930.
The relationship between industrialization and income per capita in the long-run is presented in the
last six columns of Table 6. As shown in Column (7), unconditionally, the horse power of steam engines in
industrial production in 1860-1865 has a significant positive association with the average level of income per
capita across departments over the 2001-2005 period. Moreover, this relationship remains positive, although
smaller and ultimately insignificant, once one progressively accounts for the confounding effects of exogenous
geographical factors (Column (8) in Table 6), institutional factors (Column (9) in Table 6) and pre-industrial
characteristics (Column (10) in Table 6). However, once the effect of omitted variables is accounted for, the
IV estimation in Column (11) in Table 6, suggests that the horse power of steam engines in 1860-1865 had
a negative and significant impact on the average level of income per capita across departments over the
2001-2005 period. A one-percent increase in the total horse power of steam engines in 1860-1865 decreased
GDP per capita in 2001-2005 by 0.060 percent. In other words, if a department had experienced an increase
in its horse power in 1860-1865 from the 40th percentile (380 hp) to the 60th percentile (762 hp) of the

Note: This table presents OLS and IV regressions relating the horse power of steam engines in 1860-1865 to log GDP per capita in 1930 and 2001-2005. All
regressions include a dummy variable for the three departments which had no steam engine in 1860-1865. Aerial distances are measured in kilometers. Other

distribution, this increase would have led to a 6.06 percent decrease in GDP per capita in 2001-2005. The
validity of the IV regression in Column (11) is confirmed by the reduced form regression plots in Figure B.1
in the Appendix where our two instruments Distance to Fresnes and Temperature Deviations are shown to
have a significant impact on income per capita in 2001-2005.
It is important to note that the IV estimation reverses the OLS estimates of the relationship between
industrialization and the long-run level of income per capita from a positive to a negative one. This reversal
suggests that factors which fostered industrial development, rather than industrialization per se, contributed
to the positive association between industrialization and long-run development. In particular, once one
accounts for the effect of these omitted factors, industrialization has an adverse effect on the standard of living
in the long-run. In contrast, in earlier periods (i.e., 1860, 1901, and 1930) when industrialization contributed
to economic development, the net effect of industrialization could have been obscured by these omitted
characteristics (e.g., state capacity) that while being instrumental for industrialization, were associated
with the protection of the agricultural sector, reducing income per capita and thus lowering its estimated
association with industrialization. Consequently, once the net effect of industrialization is accounted for, the
IV coefficient is significantly larger.

24

In particular, as discussed in Section 2.3, the regressions in Tables 5 and 6 account for a large number
of confounding geographical and institutional factors. First, the climatic and soil characteristics of each
department (i.e., land suitability, average temperature, average rainfall, and latitude) could have affected
natural land productivity and therefore the feasibility and profitability of the transition to the industrial
stage of development, as well as the evolution of aggregate productivity in each department. Indeed, as
predicted, land suitability had a significantly negative association with income per capita in 1901 and 1930
in the IV regressions (Column (10) in Table 5 and Column (5) in Table 6), suggesting that more productive
land had an adverse effect on the incentive to adopt the industrial technology. Moreover, the latitude of each
department had a positive and significant relationship with income per capita in 1901 and 1930 (Columns
(7) to (10) in Table 5 and Columns (2) to (5) in Table 6), capturing characteristics of northern departments
which were conducive to economic prosperity. Moreover, the lack of statistical significance of the geographical
variables on log GDP per capita in 2000-2005 (Column (10) in Table 6) is in line with the idea that geographic
characteristics do not have much of a role in the modern growth regime which is characterized by human
capital accumulation (Galor, 2011).
Second, the location of departments (i.e., latitude, border departments, maritime departments, departments at a greater distance from the concentration of political power in Paris, and those that were
temporarily under German domination) could have affected the diffusion of the steam engine and the diffusion of development. However, most of these factors appear orthogonal to the evolution of income per
capita, except for the dummy variable for Paris and its suburbs that is significantly associated with income
per capita in 1930 and in the 2001-2005 period (Columns (3) to (5) and (8) to (10) in Table 6).
Third, the regressions account for the potentially confounding effects of the level of development in the
pre-industrial period, as captured by the degree of urbanization in each department in 1700. The findings
suggest that pre-industrial development (and the characteristics that may have brought this early prosperity)
had a persistent positive and significant effect on later stages of development, as captured by the level of
income per capita in 1930 and 2001-2005 (Columns (4), (5), (9), & (10) in Table 6), but no robust impact on
the early phases of industrialization, as captured by income per capita in 1860 and 1901 (Columns (4), (5),
(9), & (10) in Table 5). Moreover, as established in Table B.2, if one accounts for a possible common spatial
pattern between the two instruments and uses the residual from the regression of Distance to Fresnes on
Temperature Deviations as an instrumental variable, the results are stronger economically and statistically.
Finally, as established in Tables B.12-B.17 in the Appendix, the association between intensity of the
steam engines and income per capita in 1861, 1901, 1930 and 2001-2005 is not affected by spatial correlation
or by clustering the standard errors at the regional level (using the current 13 administrative regions of the
French territory).

4.2

Industrialization & Income: Accounting for other Confounding Factors

This section examines the robustness of the baseline analysis to the inclusion of an additional set of confounding geographical, demographic, political and institutional characteristics, as well as for the forces of
pre-industrial development, which may have contributed to the relationship between industrialization and
economic development. The analysis focuses on the potential impact of these confounding factors on the IV
regressions in Tables 5 and 6. As will become apparent, some of these confounding factors could be viewed
25

as “bad controls”, i.e., as endogenous to the adoption of the steam engine, and they are thus not part of the
baseline analysis.
4.2.1

Initial Level of Income per Capita

The non-monotonic impact of industrialization on the evolution of income per capita precludes direct concerns
about the adverse effect of the initial level of income per capita on the growth of each department In
particular, the convergence hypothesis would suggests that the initial positive effect of industrialization will
dissipate over time, rather than turning negative. In fact, as established in Table B.19 the long-term effect
of industrialization is qualitatively unaffected by the initial level of log GDP per capita in 1860. It remains
positive in 1930 and even more negative in 2001-2005.
4.2.2

Population Density

The empirical analysis accounts for a wide range of exogenous confounding geographical and institutional
characteristics, as well as for pre-industrial development, which may have contributed to the relationship
between industrialization and economic development. Nevertheless, in light of the evidence that steam
engines were more likely to be located in urban centers (Rosenberg and Trajtenberg, 2004), it appears
plausible that the adoption of the steam engine was influenced by the contemporaneous but potentially
endogenous level of population density at the time.
Reassuringly, as established in Table B.20 in the Appendix, the inclusion of population density in
each French department in 1801, 1831 and 1861 has no qualitative impact on the estimated effects of
industrialization or on the statistical significance of these effects. Accounting for the confounding effects
of exogenous geographical, institutional, and pre-industrial characteristics, the horse power of steam engines
in industrial production in the 1860-1865 period had a positive and significant impact on income per capita
in 1860, and a negative and significant impact on income per capita in the years 2001-2005.
4.2.3

Human Capital

Considering evidence about capital-skill complementarity as well as the comparative advantage of educated
individuals in adopting new technologies (Nelson and Phelps, 1966), the diffusion of the steam engine could
have been affected by the level of human capital in each department. Using data on the presence of a university in 1700 and 1793, the percentage of French army conscripts who could at least read in 1827-1829 and
1831-1835 (which could be endogenous the process of industrialization) and on the percentage of grooms who
could sign their marriage license in 1686-1690 and 1786-1790, it appears in Tables B.21, B.22 and B.23 that
these measures of human capital have no qualitative impact on the estimated effects of industrialization. In
particular, accounting for the confounding effects of exogenous geographical, institutional, and pre-industrial
characteristics, industrialization had a positive and significant impact on income per capita in 1860, but no
significant impact on income per capita in 2001-2005.

26

4.2.4

Share of Jews and Protestants in the Population

In light of the evidence about the importance of the Jewish and the Protestant population for entrepreneurial
activities (e.g., Weber (1930)), the adoption of the steam engine in France as well as the process of development could have been affected by the variations in the share of these religious minorities across departments.
As shown in Table B.24 in the Appendix, accounting for the shares of Jews and Protestants in the French
population in 1861 (i.e., when the industrial survey was conducted) has no qualitative impact on the effect
of industrialization on income per capita in 1860 and 2001-2005.
4.2.5

The Early Use of Raw Material

As was shown in the baseline regressions in Tables 5 and 6, the statistical impact of industrialization remains
intact when one accounts for the share of carboniferous area in each department (Fernihough and O’Rourke,
2014). Nonetheless,the diffusion of the steam engine across French departments as well as the process of
development could have been affected by the early use of raw material required for industrialization. Our
regressions reported in Tables B.25 and B.26 however show that this is not the case. First, as established
in Table B.25, accounting for the number of iron forges in 1789 and 1811 in each department, the effect
of industrialization on income per capita in the process of development remains nearly intact, economically
and statistically. Second, as shown in Table B.26, accounting for the area covered by coal mines in 1837 in
each department, the effect of industrialization on income per capita in the process of development remains
qualitatively intact.
4.2.6

Economic Integration

The diffusion of the steam engine across French departments as well as the process of development could have
been affected by the degree of geographical and economic integration of each department into the French
economy.21 First, as reported in Table B.27, the degree of market integration of each department in the
1790s, as captured by the number of firms which were located in one department but sold their products
outside that department (Daudin, 2010), has no qualitative impact on the effect of industrialization on
income per capita in the process of development. Second, as reported in Table B.28, accounting for the
presence of railroad connection in 1860,22 the effect of industrialization on income per capita in the process
of development remains nearly intact, economically and statistically.
4.2.7

Industrial Concentration and Firm Size

The degree of industrial concentration in each department could have affected the diffusion of the steam
engine across French departments as well as the process of development. Nevertheless, as reported in Table
B.29, accounting for the degree of industrial concentration in the 1860-1865 period, proxied by the Herfindahl
index of the horse power for the 16 different industries listed in the 1860-1865 industrial survey (textile, mines,
metallurgy, metal objects, leather, wood, ceramics, chemistry, construction, lighting, furniture, clothing,
21 See

Donaldson (2015) for a recent survey of the impact of market integration.
early network was built around seven lines in order to connect Paris to the main economic centers of the country
(Caron, 1997).
22 The

27

food, transportation, sciences & arts, and luxury goods), the effect of industrialization on income per capita
in the process of development remains nearly intact, economically and statistically.23 Moreover, as shown
in Table B.30, the economic and statistical impact of industrialization on income per capita remains nearly
intact when one accounts for the Herfindahl index based on industry-specific employment shares. In addition,
we account for the possibility that the size of the firms in 1860-1865, as proxied by the number of employees
per firm in each department, would depress income per capita in the long-run because large firms are less
likely to adopt new technologies and could become an impediment to entrepreneurship. The results in Table
B.31 however show that accounting for the number of employees per firm does not modify the statistical and
economic impact of industrialization on income per capita in the short- and in the long-run.

4.3

External Validity and Policy Implications

This section examines the external validity of the finding that industrialization is detrimental to long-run
prosperity for less-developed societies. If one views each French department as a small-open economy, one
may argue that the proper industrial policy ought to encourage the development of skilled-intensive sectors
rather than of the traditional unskilled-intensive sectors.
However, one concern could be the negative effect of industrialization in the long-run at the departmental level does not reflect the overall effect of industrialization. A priori, it is possible that industrialization
generated technological spillovers such that the most industrialized department within a region declined but
the region prospered as a whole due to the spillovers from this industrialization process. In order to explore
this important possibility, Table B.18 analyzes the effect of industrialization at the regional level (using the
current administrative divisions of France into 12 regions, each of which consists approximately of seven
departments). Importantly, the results in Table B.18 demonstrate that the regions, as a whole, experienced
an identical pattern, i.e., a increase in prosperity in the short-run and a decline in in the long-run. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis suggests that the negative impact of industrialization on long-run prosperity
in one department did not generate sufficiently positive spillovers in neighboring departments so as to avert
the adverse effects of industrialization on long-run prosperity of the region as a whole.24
Furthermore, when considering industrial policy in currently less developed societies, one has to account
for the fact that those societies could adopt existing technologies of various degrees of skill-intensity. Namely,
less developed countries do not need to develop less-skilled industries in order to adopt skilled-intensive ones.
In this respect, the departmental level analysis of France suggests that less developed societies ought to
promote the development of skilled-intensive sectors rather than an unskilled intensive industrial sector.

24 Distances from Fresnes-sur-Escaut to each department are powerful predictors of the intensity of the use of steam engines
in 1860-65 across French departments as a whole. However, distances from Fresnes-sur-Escaut are not sufficiency refined to
provide a significant prediction of the variations in the use of the steam engine across nearby departments within each of 12
contemporary regions of France. Hence, one cannot use the proposed IV strategy to test for the reversal within each of these
12 regions (i.e., across 7 nearby departments on average). Nevertheless, reassuringly, as established in Table B.18, the reversal
in the effect of the industrialization on long run prosperity is highly significant across these 12 regions as well.
23 The

Mechanisms

This section explores several potential mechanisms that could have led to the detrimental effect of industrialization on the standard of living in the long-run. The analysis suggests that the adverse effect of earlier
industrialization on long-run prosperity can be attributed to the negative impact of the intensive use of
unskilled-intensive technologies in the early stages of industrialization on the long-run level of human capital
and thus on the incentive to adopt skill-intensive technologies in the contemporary era. The adverse effect
of industrialization on long-run prosperity reflects a dual techno-cultural lock-in effect characterized by cultural inertia in the intergenerational transmission of a lower predisposition towards investment in human
capital along with technological inertia manifested by the persistence predominance of low-skilled-intensive
industries.
Consistent with the proposed techno-cultural dual lock-in hypothesis, the empirical analysis exploits
individual data on education achievements of over 2100 second generation migrants to establish that acquired
comparative advantage in the unskilled-intensive industrial sector has ultimately depressed the demand for
human capital and have triggered a cultural process characterized by intergenerational transmission of lower
educational aspirations. Furthermore, using individual data on the composition of employment across sectors
among over 1.1 million individuals, the study suggests that this cultural inertia, and its adverse effect on
human capital formation in the long-run, has further hindered the incentive of competitive industries to adopt
more lucrative skilled-intensive technologies, reinforcing the suboptimal level of human capital formation and
reducing the standards of living in the long-run. Interestingly, the findings suggest that the adverse effect
of earlier industrialization on long-run prosperity does not reflect a delayed transition from the industrial to
the service sector, but rather the lower skill-intensity of occupations in the service as well as in the industrial
sector in historically industrial regions.
The empirical analysis further establishes that various ex-ante plausible channels do not account for
the adverse effect of early industrialization on long-run prosperity: (1) the contribution of industrialization
to unionization and wage rates in historically industrialized regions and the comparative decline of these
regions in the long-run due to the incentive of modern industries to locate in regions where labor markets are
more competitive, (2) the effect of trade protection in traditional industries on the decline in the long-run
competitiveness of historically industrialized regions, (3) the potential negative effect of disproportional destruction of industrialized regions during WWI and WWII on the subsequent development of these regions,
(4) the persistent adverse effect of selective migration (e.g. immigration of unskilled workers into industrialized regions, or the emigration of more educated workers into less industrialized regions), on the composition
of human capital and long-run income per capita in historically industrialized regions, and (5) the disproportionate public investment in human capital in non-industrial regions. Moreover, the empirical analysis
demonstrates that the adverse effect of industrialization on long-run prosperity has not been mitigated by
the positive effect of early industrialization on population density in historically industrialized regions and
its beneficial effects via the spillover from agglomeration to long-run development.

5.1

Industrialization and the Dual Techno-Cultural Lock-In Effect

This section provides supporting evidence for the hypothesis that the adverse effect of industrialization on
long-run prosperity can be attributed to a dual techno-cultural lock-in effect. In particular, it demonstrates
that the effect of early industrialization on acquired comparative advantage in the unskilled-intensive industrial sector depressed the demand for human capital and have triggered cultural inertia, characterized by a
lower predisposition towards investment in human capital, that has further hindered the incentive of firms to
adopt skilled-intensive technologies, adversely effecting human capital formation and the standards of living
in the long-run.
The empirical support for the hypothesized dual lock-in effect is based on three findings. First, the
analysis establishes that indeed industrialization have an adverse effect on human capital formation in the
long-run. Second, it demonstrates the existence of a cultural lock-in effect, reflected by the persistent effect
of historical industrialization on investment in human capital among second generation migrants who are no
longer residing in these industrial regions. Third, it suggests that under investment in human capital affected
the contemporary composition of industries in historically industrial regions and reinforced the specialization
in unskilled-intensive industries.
5.1.1

Industrialization and the Evolution of Human Capital

This subsection explores the validity of the first building block of the hypothesized dual techno-cultural
lock-in effect that has governed the detrimental effect of industrialization on the standard of living in the
long-run. It establishes the adverse effect of historically industrialized regions on the the contemporary level
of human capital and thus on the skill-intensity of the production process in these regions in the long-run.
The horse power of steam engines in industrial production in 1860-1865 had a progressively larger
adverse effect on the share of men age 25 and above who had at least high-school degree in the past few
decades as reported in the IV regressions in Table 7).25 These adverse effects are statistically significant in
1975, 1982, 1990, 1999 and 2010.26
Moreover, as reported in the IV regressions in Table 8, the horse power of steam engines in industrial
production in 1860-1865 has a highly significant negative effect on human capital formation in the long-run,
as captured by the shares of male age 15-17 or 18-24, who attended school in 201 (note that school attendance
is mandatory in France until age 16). These regressions indicate that in departments which utilized the steam
engine more intensively 150 years ago, a smaller fraction of men age 15-17 remain in high-school and a smaller
fraction of men age 18-24 study in institutions of higher learning.27 As will become apparent, some of this
adverse effect on human capital formation can be attributed to cultural inertia and its effect on reduced
educational aspiration among individuals from historically intensive industrial regions.
25 As established by Franck and Galor (2017), due to capital-skill complementarity , intensive industrialization in the middle
of the 19th century had a significantly positive effect on human capital formation in the subsequent decades in France (as well
as in other industrial nations (Galor and Moav, 2006)). Nevertheless, as the novelty of the industrial technology diminished,
the positive effects of early industrialization on human capital formation had dissipated in the early part of the 20th century
(Table D.2 in the Appendix). Instead, inertia in the use of unskilled-intensive technologies in historically intensive industrial
regions, have had an adverse effect on the time path of human capital formation.
26 Similar results are found for women as reported in Table D.3 in the Appendix.
27 Similar results are found for school enrollment rates of women age 15-17 and 18-24 in 2010, as reported in Table D.1 in
the Appendix.

Cultural Persistence of Predisposition Towards Investment in Human Capital

This subsection demonstrates the existence of a cultural lock-in effect in the formation of human capital,
reflected by the persistent effect of historical industrialization on investment in human capital and aspiration
with respect to human capital among the descendants of these historically intensive industrial regions. In
particular, it demonstrates that the effect of early industrialization on acquired comparative advantage
in the unskilled-intensive industrial sector depressed the demand for human capital and have triggered
cultural inertia, characterized by a lower predisposition towards investment in human capital, that has further
hindered the incentive of firms to adopt more lucrative skilled-intensive technologies, adversely effecting
human capital formation and the standards of living in the long-run.
Following the epidemiological approach for the study of cultural persistence, the study exploits data on
second generation migrants (i.e., individuals who live in their birth department whose parents are originated
from a different department within France) to establish the presence of cultural inertia in the formation
of human capital among the decedents of these historically intensive industrial regions. The analysis of
second-generation migrants accounts for time invariant unobserved heterogeneity in the host department
(e.g., geographical, cultural and institutional characteristics), mitigating possible concerns about the confounding effect of host department-specific characteristics. Moreover, since the historical industrial intensity
in the parental department of origin is distinct from the historical industrial intensity in the individual’s
department of residence, the estimated effect of industrial intensity in the parental department of origin on
their human capital formation captures the culturally embodied, intergenerationally transmitted effect of
industrial intensity on human capital aspirations, rather than the direct effect of industrial intensity.

Note: This table presents IV regressions relating the horse power of steam engines in 1860-1865 in the origin department for the parents of second generation

respondent’s birth department. The control variables refer to the origin department of the respondent’s mother (Columns (1)-(2)), father (Columns (3)(4)) and both parents (Columns (5)-(6)). Aerial distances are measured in kilometers. Other explanatory variables, except the dummies, and the dependent
variables are in logarithm. Individual characteristics include the respondent’s age and gender. Parental characteristics include dummies indicating whether the
respondent’s father or mother were workers. Geographic characteristics include the department’s latitude, land suitability, average rainfall and temperature,

The analysis finds that second generation migrants whose parents were originated in historically industrial regions are significantly more likely to have:(i) low human capital aspirations, as reflected by their
acquisition of vocational education and their departure from the the schooling system in the end of the
middle school, and (ii) diminished entrepreneurial spirit. Furthermore, accounting for the parental occupation, the effects remains highly significant. This result lend credence to the presence of cultural inertia that
contributed to technological inertia and triggered the dual lock-in effect. In particular, using a representative
labor survey carried out in 2005, Table 9 shows that the highest educational degree of these second-generation
migrants was a Certificat d’Aptitude Professionnelle, i.e., a two-year vocational degree which is taken around
age 14-15, and Table 10 establishes, that among these second-generation migrants there is a lower propensity
of owning a business and to be self employed.28
Consistent with these findings, Table 11 shows that early industrialization is associated a lower contemporary valuation of science. In particular, individuals who are currently employed in a department that
has a higher intensity steam engines 150 years ago express no interest in science and who report not using
science in their current work in a survey carried out in 2001 (Centre de recherches politiques de Sciences Po,
Enquête science 2001).

Notes: This table presents IV regressions relating modern measures of human capital and entrepreneurship, the horse power of steam engines in 1860-1865 to log GDP per capita in
2001-2005. All regressions include a dummy variable for the three departments which had no steam engine in 1860-1865. The Alsace-Lorraine variable is omitted from the regressions
since the Alsace-Lorraine region was not part of France between 1871 and 1914. Aerial distances are measured in kilometers. Individual characteristics include the respondent’s age and
gender. Other explanatory variables, except the dummies, and the dependent variables are in logarithm. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are reported in brackets. *** indicates
significance at the 1%-level, ** at the 5%-level, * at the 10%-level.

Furthermore Table 12 demonstrates that low human capital formation and diminished entrepreneurial
spirit are indeed plausible mediating channels through which early industrial development has an adverse
effect of the contemporary level of income per capita. Columns (1)-(4) report the IV regressions from Tables
7-10 for the effect of the horse power of steam engines on the share of men above 25 with a post-secondary
degree, the shares of men age 15-17 and 18-24 enrolled in school as well as the probability that a secondgeneration migrant is self-employed or a business owner. Columns (5)-(9) report the mediating effects of
these variables in IV regressions for the effect of the horse power of steam engines on income per capita in
2001-2005. The finding suggests that these variables are significantly correlated with log GDP per capita
in 2001-2005 at the 1% or 5% level, and that accounting for their association with the level of income per
capita, diminishes the effect of the horse power of steam engines on log GDP per capita in 2001-2005.
5.1.3

Industrialization and Technological Inertia

This subsection suggests that under-investment in human capital affected the contemporary composition of
industries in historically industrial regions and reinforced the specialization in unskilled-intensive industries.
In particular, it demonstrates that since the effect of early industrialization on acquired comparative advantage in the unskilled-intensive industrial sector depressed the demand for human capital and have triggered
cultural inertia, characterized by a lower predisposition towards investment in human capital, this suboptimal level of human capital formation has further hindered the incentive of firms to adopt more lucrative
skilled-intensive technologies, adversely effecting human capital formation and the standards of living in the
long-run.

Notes: This table presents IV regressions relating the horse power of steam engines in 1860-1865 to the probability that private sector employees in 2008 work
for firms in the following sectors: wood industries, coal industries, metallurgy, machinery repair, production & distribution of electrical appliances, scientific
R&D, accommodation and catering, real Estate arts & entertainment. Aerial distances are measured in kilometers. Other explanatory variables, except
the dummies, and the dependent variables are in logarithm. Individual characteristics include the respondent’s age and gender. Geographic characteristics
include the department’s latitude, land suitability, average rainfall and temperature, share of carboniferous area, distance to Paris as well as dummies for
the presence of rivers and tributaries, maritime and border departments.

Institutional measures include dummies for Alsace-Lorraine and for Paris and

its suburbs. Pre-industrial development characteristics include a measure of the urban population in 1700. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are
reported in brackets. *** indicates significance at the 1%-level, ** at the 5%-level, * at the 10%-level.

The long-run negative effect of industrialization on the workforce is reflected in the types of firms
which employ individuals. Using a 2008 governmental survey on 1.1 million employees age 35-64 from the
private sector, Table 13 establishes that the horse power of steam engines in 1860-1865 has a negative and
significant effect at the 5-% level on the probability that private sector employees work in firms in the R&D
sector, as well as in service firms in accommodation & catering, arts & entertainment and real estate. but a
35

positive and significant effect at the 5-% level on the probability that they work in low-skilled firms in the
coal, metallurgical, wood sector as well as in the production of electrical appliances and in machinery repair.
As such, Table 13 confirms the basic thrust of the analysis that past industrialization has contributed to
technological inertia and explains the continued predominance of low-skilled-intensive industries.
These results lend credence to the argument that historical industrial regions have experienced a
technological lock-in effect. Namely, acquired comparative advantage in the unskilled-intensive sector in
early stages of industrialization is associated with the relative dominance of unskilled intensive firms and
occupations.

This subsection establishes that the adverse effect of earlier industrialization on long-run prosperity does
not reflect a delay transition from the industrial to the service sector, but rather the lower skill-intensity of
occupation in the service as well as the industrial sector in historically industrial regions.
As depicted in panel A of Figure 9 (based on the IV regressions in Tables C.2 and C.3 in the Appendix),
an intensive use of the steam engine in 1860-1865 had a highly significant positive effect on the share
of employment in the industrial sector in 1861, 1901, and 1930. This effect remains positive and highly
significant in 1968, 1975, and 1982, but is insignificant in 1990 and 1999 and finally becomes significantly
negative in 2010. Furthermore, as depicted in panel B of Figure 9 (based on the IV regressions in Tables C.2
and C.3 in the Appendix), an intensive use of the steam engine in 1860-1865 had a positive and significant
effect on the share of employment in the service sector over the period. only in 1861, 1901, and 1930 but
subsequently the effect is insignificant.

The study further explores the effect of industrialization on the long-run composition of human capital
as it is reflected in the workforce in each department. First, it focuses on the evolution in the shares of
executives, middle management professions, and employees (i.e., individuals with high, medium, and low
levels of human capital) in the labor force between 1968 and 2010.29 It demonstrates that industrialization
had a detrimental effect on employment in skilled-intensive occupations, although industrialization had no
effect on the share of employment in the service sector in the long-run. As depicted in Panels A–C of Figure
10 (based on the IV regressions in Tables C.5–C.7 in the Appendix), the horse power of steam engines in
industrial production in 1860-1865 had a significantly negative effect on the share of executives and other
intellectual professions as well as middle management professions among individuals age 25-54 in 2010.
In contrast, the effect on the share of employees is positive and significant in 2010. Furthermore, these

5.3

Alternative Channels

This section establishes that alternative plausible channels are inconsistent with the evidence. First, the
labor market channel: the contribution of industrialization to unionization and wage rates in historically
industrialized regions and the comparative decline of these regions in the long-run due to the incentive
of modern industries to locate in regions where labor markets are more competitive. Second, the trade
protection channel: the effect of trade protection on traditional industry on the decline in competitiveness of
historically industrialized regions in the long-run. Third, the war destruction channel: the potential negative
effect of disproportional destruction of industrialized regions during WWI and WWII on the subsequent
development of these regions. Fourth, the migration channel: the persistent adverse effect of selective
migration (e.g. immigration of unskilled workers into industrialized regions, or the emigration of more
educated workers into less industrialized regions), on the composition of human capital and long-run income
per capita in historically industrialized regions. Fifth, the public expenditure channel: the diversion of public
investment in human capital towards non-industrial regions. Moreover, the empirical analysis demonstrates
that the adverse effect of industrialization on long-run prosperity has not been mitigated by the positive
effect of early industrialization on population density in historically industrialized regions and its potential
beneficial effects via the spillover from agglomeration to long-run development.
5.3.1

The Labor Market Channel

The adverse effect of industrialization on income per capita in the long-run may reflect the adverse effect
of industrialization on the competitiveness of the labor market in the long-run. In particular, the growth of
the industrial sector may have led to the establishment of labor unions, which deterred new industries from
locating in regions characterized by higher wages and possibly lower productivity.30
Indeed, as reported in Column (1) of Table 14, the degree of industrialization in the year 1860-1865
has no significant relationship with the share of unionized workers in the workforce in 1930. Moreover, as
reported in Columns (2) and (3), the degree of unionization is, in fact, positively associated with the level
income per capita in the long-run, and it does not have a qualitative impact on the estimated effect of
industrialization on income per capita in the long-run.31
30 Unions were given a legal status in France in 1884. It is worth noting that in France, unlike in the USA for instance, labor
regulations are identical throughout the country. Nevertheless, unions could have negotiated higher salaries in specific firms.
31 Since unionization is potentially endogenous to the adoption of the steam engine and we treat it as a “bad controls”to

GDP per capita in 2001-2005 is robust to accounting for the past share of union workers (in 1930). All regressions include a dummy variable for the three
departments which had no steam engine in 1860-1865. Aerial distances are measured in kilometers. Other explanatory variables, except the dummies, and
the dependent variables are in logarithm. Geographic characteristics include the department’s latitude, land suitability, average rainfall and temperature,
share of carboniferous area, distance to Paris as well as dummies for the presence of rivers and tributaries, maritime and border departments. Institutional
measures include dummies for Alsace-Lorraine and for Paris and its suburbs. Pre-industrial development characteristics include a measure of the urban
population in 1700. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are reported in brackets. *** indicates significance at the 1%-level, ** at the 5%-level, * at
the 10%-level.

Similarly, Column (1) of Table 15 suggests that the relation between industrialization in 1860-1865 and
the average male wage in each department in 1901 is insignificant as well. Moreover, as reported in Columns
(2) and (3), the average adult wage in 1901 is in fact positively related to income per capita in the long-run,
and it does not have a qualitative impact on the estimated effect of industrialization on income per capita
in the long-run. Thus, the adverse effect of industrialization on income per capita in the long-run cannot be
attributed to the effect of labor unions and higher wages.
5.3.2

The Trade and Environment Protection Channels

This section explores whether the detrimental effect of industrialization on the standard of living in the longrun could be attributed to the adverse effect of trade protection on the competitiveness of each department
in the long-run.
In light of the departmental variation in the composition of the 16 sectors that constituted the industrial
sector in 1860-1865, the imposition of tariffs on import by the national government could have affected each
department differentially. In particular, the degree of competitiveness in the most advanced industrial sectors
could have diminished and may have thus led to their economic decline in the long-run. (As such, tariffs
could be viewed as endogenous to the adoption of the steam engine and to account for their effects, they are
treated as potential “bad controls”.

Nevertheless, as reported in Table 16 intensive industrialization in the 1860-1865 period is unrelated to
the weighted tariffs across sectors in 1865, 1901, 1953 (just before the signature of the 1957 Treaty of Rome
which founded the European Union) and 2000.32 Moreover, tariff rates in the years 1865, 1901, 1953 and
2000 had a negative but mostly insignificant association with income per capita in 2001-2005.33 Furthermore,
tariff does not have a qualitative impact on the estimated effect of industrialization on income per capita in
the long-run. Thus, the adverse effect of industrialization on income per capita in the long-run cannot be
attributed to the effect of industrialization on trade protection.
Moreover, since environmental regulation is sometimes associated with industrial protection, we investigate whether restrictions on CO2 emissions had an effect on income per capita. In particular, the directives
of the European Union compelled the French government to decrease quotas on CO2 emissions and might
have entailed a decline in competitiveness of polluting industries (e.g., mining) which led development in the
19th century. For this purpose, we collect governmental data on actual levels of CO2 emissions in 2005 and
compute the ratio of quotas on CO2 emissions in 2012 to actual levels in 2005 in each department. The OLS
regressions in Columns (1) and (2) of Table F.3 establish that the horse power of steam engines in 1860-1865
is positively and significantly correlated with CO2 emission levels in 2005 but not with the ratio of quotas
on CO2 emissions in 2012 to actual levels in 2005. Furthermore, the inclusion of these two variables in the
IV regressions in Columns (3)-(5) of Table F.3 does not modify the negative and significant impact of the
horse power of steam engines on income per capita in 2001-2005. As such, it appears that environmental
regulation does not explain the negative impact of 19th century industrialization on present income.
5.3.3

The War Destruction Channel

World War I and World War II, and the associated destruction of physical capital, may have affected
disproportionately industrial centers, potentially leading to their decline in the long-run. Nevertheless,
accounting for the destruction of physical capital does not affect the qualitative results.34
While the physical destruction in industrial intensive departments was indeed larger in WWI, according
to Column (1) of Table 17, it had no impact on the adverse effect of industrialization and income per capita in
2001-2005. Since the battlefields during WWI were in the Northern and Eastern parts of France, destruction
of buildings during WWI is highly correlated with the distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut. Consequently, the
diminished effect of industrialization on income per capita in the contemporary period, as reported in column
(4) of Table 17, partly reflects the decline in the power of the instrumental variables below the desirable
threshold of 10. However, accounting for the number of buildings destroyed in each department in WWII,
the destruction of physical capital in this war has no qualitative impact on the effect of industrialization on
income per capita in 2001-2005 (Columns (3)-(5) of Table 17).
32 This pattern may reflect the fact that tariffs in the early period were also levied on agricultural products and the protection
of industrial departments was not eventually different from departments that remained agricultural (Crouzet, 2003).
33 As reported in Table F.2 in the Appendix, there is no significant relationship between tariff and income per capita in the
years 1860, 1901, and 1930 and the tariff rate in the past has neither an economic impact nor a statistical one on the effect of
industrialization on income per capita in 1860, 1901 and 1930. There is no effect of the tariff rate in 1970 and 1990 on income
per capita in 2001-2005
34 Available data on destruction of human capital during the war is restricted to the death of soldiers rather than civilians.
Moreover, soldier deaths are classified based on the department of origin of each soldier, rather than on the place where the
death took place. In this respect, disproportionate destruction of human capital in industrial departments will not be reflected
in the data and thus cannot be used to reaffirmed the results based on the destruction of physical capital.

5.3.4

The Migration Channel

The persistent adverse effect of selective migration (e.g. immigration of unskilled workers into industrialized
regions or emigration of more educated workers into less industrialized regions) on the composition of human
capital could have been associated with the adverse effect of early industrialization on the long-run level of
income per capita in these regions.
However, as reported in Table 18 there is no significant correlation between the horse power of steam
engines in 1860-1865 and the share of natives in the population of each department in 1901 and 2010.35
Moreover, accounting for the share of the native population in each department in 1901 and 2001-2005
does not substantially affect the negative effect of industrialization on income per capita in the 2001-2005
period becomes highly significant. Moreover, since migration flows are likely to be towards more prosperous
departments, a higher percentage of natives in the departmental population is indicative of a less attractive
migration destination, and indeed in both time periods higher percentage of native population is associated
with lower income per capita (Columns (2) and (4)), although the relationship is not significant in the
modern period.

35 The

1860 and 1931 censuses do not provide information on the native population in each department.

Note: This table presents OLS and IV regressions to establish that the negative relationship between the horse power of steam engines in 1860-1865 and
log GDP per capita in 2001-2005 is robust to the share of the native population in 1901 and 2000. All regressions include a dummy variable for the three
departments which had no steam engine in 1860-1865. Aerial distances are measured in kilometers. Other explanatory variables, except the dummies, and the
dependent variables are in logarithm. Geographic characteristics include the department’s latitude, land suitability, average rainfall and temperature, share of
carboniferous area, distance to Paris as well as dummies for the presence of rivers and tributaries, maritime and border departments. Institutional measures
include dummies for Alsace-Lorraine and for Paris and its suburbs. Pre-industrial development characteristics include a measure of the urban population in
1700. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are reported in brackets. *** indicates significance at the 1%-level, ** 5%-level, * 10%-level.

The Public Expenditure Channel

However, as reported in Tables 19 and D.4, there is no significant correlation between the horse power of
steam engines in 1860-1865 and the departmental governments’ spending on education per capita in the late
19th century and at the turn of the 21st century. Moreover, does not qualitatively affect the negative and
significant impact of 19th century industrialization on log GDP per capita in 2001-2005.
The diversion of public investment in human capital towards non-industrial regions, could have contributed to the negative impact of intensive industrialization in the past on long-run prosperity
5.3.6

The Agglomeration Channel

The empirical analysis further demonstrates that the adverse effect of industrialization on long-run prosperity
has not been mitigated by the positive effect of early industrialization on population density in historically
industrialized regions and its potential beneficial effects via the spillover from agglomeration to long-run
development.
As reported in Tables 20 and E.1, past levels of population in each department and in each department’s
chef-lieu (i.e., its administrative capital), are not associated with the horse power of steam engines in the
1860-1865 period. Moreover, while the scale of the population is correlated with income per capita in 20012005, the adverse effect of the horse power of steam engines in 1860-1865 on income per capita in 2001-2005
remains highly significant.

Concluding Remarks

This research explores the long-run effect of industrialization on the process of development. In contrast to
conventional wisdom that views industrial development as a catalyst for economic growth, highlighting its
persistent effect on economic prosperity, the study establishes that while the adoption of industrial technology
was initially conducive for economic development, it has had a detrimental effect on standards of living in
the long-run.
The study exploits exogenous source of regional variation in the adoption of steam engines during the
French industrial revolution to establish that regions which industrialized more intensively experienced an
increase in literacy rates more swiftly and generated higher income per capita in the subsequent decades.
Nevertheless, industrialization had an adverse effect on income per capita by the turn of the 21st century.
The research further explores the mediating channels through which earlier industrial development has
an adverse effect of the contemporary level of development. It suggests that the adverse effect of industrialization on long-run prosperity reflects the adverse effect of earlier specialization in unskilled-intensive
industries on human capital formation and the incentive to adopt skill-intensive technologies in the contemporary era. Industrialization has triggered a dual techno-cultural lock-in effect characterized by a reinforcing
interaction between technological inertia, reflected by the persistence predominance of low-skilled-intensive
industries and cultural inertia, in the form of a lower predisposition towards investment in human capital.
In particular, while the adoption of industrial technology was conducive for economic development in the
short-run, acquired comparative advantage in the unskilled-intensive industrial sector had triggered cultural
inertia, characterized by lower educational aspirations, that has hindered the transition to more lucrative
skilled-intensive sectors, adversely effecting human capital formation and the standards of living in the
long-run.
The study suggests that the characteristics that permitted the onset of industrialization, rather than
the adoption of industrial technology per se, may have been the source of prosperity among the currently
developed economies that experienced an early industrialization. Moreover the study highlights the existence
of an intertemporal trade-off associated with industrialization. It suggests that developing countries may
benefit from the allocation of resources towards human capital formation and skill-intensive sectors rather
than toward the development of an unskilled-intensive industrial sector.

Figure B.1: Reduced Form Relationship between the Instrumental Variables and log GDP per capita 2001-2005
Notes: These figures depict the partial regression line of the reduced form association between: (i) distance from Fresnes-sur-Escaut and
(ii) temperature deviations in 1856-1859 period from their historical trend, and the log of GDP per capita in 2001-2005 in each French
department. In both panels, the relationship accounts for geographic and institutional characteristics, as well as for pre-industrial
development.

Note: All regressions include a dummy variable for the three departments which had no steam engine in 1860-1865. Aerial distances are measured in kilometers. Other explanatory variables, except the dummies, and the dependent variables are in
logarithm. Robust standard errors are reported in brackets. Geographic characteristics include the department’s latitude, land suitability, average rainfall and temperature, share of carboniferous area, distance to Paris as well as dummies for the
presence of rivers and tributaries, maritime and border departments. Institutional measures include dummies for Alsace-Lorraine and for Paris and its suburbs. Pre-industrial development characteristics include a measure of the urban population
in 1700. *** indicates significance at the 1%-level, ** at the 5%-level, * at the 10%-level.

As reported in Column (3) of Table D.2, the horse power of steam engines in industrial production in
1860-1865 had initially a positive and highly significant effect on the literacy of the French army conscripts in
the years 1874-1883. However, due to the legislation of the 1881-1882 education laws, which made primarily
schooling compulsory and free until the age of 13, the effect was quantitatively smaller but still statistically
significant in the years 1894-1903 (Column (6)). Eventually, this effect had vanished in the years 1910-1912
(Column (9)).

Explanatory variables
Horse power of steam engines. This variable reports the total horse power of the steam Engines in the firms
of each department, which is computed from the industrial survey carried out by the French government
between 1860 and 1865. See Chanut et al. (2000) for details on the implementation of this survey.
Average rainfall. The average rainfall in cm3 , reported at a half-degree resolution by Ramankutty et al.
(2002), across the French departments.
Average temperature. The average temperature (in celsius), reported at a half-degree resolution by Ramankutty et al. (2002), across the French departments.
Latitude. The latitude of the centroid of each French department.
Land Suitability The land suitability index, reported at a half-degree resolution by Ramankutty et al. (2002),
across the French departments.
Share of carboniferous area in department. The share of carboniferous area in each department. Source:
Fernihough and O’Rourke (2014).
Rivers and Tributaries. This dummy variable takes the value 1 if at least one of the main French rivers or
tributaries (whose total length is above 300 km) crosses a given department. These are the Rhin, Loire,
Meuse, Rhône, Seine, Garonne, Dordogne, Charente and Escaut.

102

Maritime department. This dummy variable takes the value one if a French department borders the coastline
and zero otherwise.
Border department. This dummy variable takes the value one if a French department borders one of the
foreign countries around France (Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Spain) and zero
otherwise.
Distance to Paris. The great circle distance as “the crow flies”from Paris, the capital of France, to the
