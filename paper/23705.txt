Real Exchange Rates, Income per Capita, and Sectoral Input Shares
Javier Cravino and Samuel E. Haltenhof
NBER Working Paper No. 23705
August 2017
JEL No. F31,F41
ABSTRACT
Aggregate price levels are positively related to GDP per capita across countries. We propose a mechanism
that rationalizes this observation through sectorial differences in intermediate input shares. As aggregate
productivity and income grow, so do wages relative to intermediate input prices, which increases the
relative price of non-tradables if tradable sectors use intermediate inputs more intensively. We show
that sectorial differences in intermediate input shares can account for two thirds of the observed elasticity
of the aggregate price level with respect to GDP per capita. The mechanism has stark implications
for industry-level real exchange rates that are strongly supported by the data.

Introduction

Aggregate price levels are positively related to income per capita across countries, as
illustrated in Figure 1a.1 The leading explanation for this observation is the BalassaSamuelson hypothesis, which postulates that productivity in tradable relative to nontradable sectors increases with income. According to this theory, the price level is determined by the price of non-tradables, and high productivity in tradables leads to high
wages and high non-tradable prices. Indeed, Figure 1b shows a strong correlation between GDP per capita and the aggregate price level, but not between GDP per capita and
tradable prices.

Notes: Price data is from the Penn World Table 9.0. GDP per capita at market prices is from the World Development Indicators.

In spite of its popularity, empirical evidence supporting the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis is scarce. An important limitation is that, since sectorial productivities are rarely
measured in levels, the model’s predictions for relative price levels (i.e. real exchange
rate levels) are hard to confront with data.2 As a result, most of the empirical literature
has focused on studying the model’s predictions for the growth of the real exchange rate
using proxies for sectorial productivity growth, often with mixed results.3
1 See

Rogoff (1996) or Feenstra et al. (2015). The positive relation between relative prices and GDP per
capita is often referred to as the ’Penn Effect’, after Summers and Heston (1991).
2 Measures of sectorial productivity are typically available in index form only. An important exception
is a recent paper by Berka et al. (2014), who find evidence in favor of the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis in
levels using newly constructed indexes on relative productivity levels for 9 Euro-zone countries.
3 In particular, a large literature finds that the Balassa-Samuelson model does not do well in explaining

This paper proposes an alternative mechanism linking real exchange rates to GDP per
capita that relies on sectorial differences in intermediate input shares rather than on crosscountry differences in sectorial productivities, and hence can be easily quantified using
readily-available input-output data. The mechanism is an extension of that in Bhagwati
(1984), who argued that if the tradable sector is capital intensive, the relative price of
non-tradables should be higher in rich, capital-abundant countries where capital is relatively cheap. We extend this idea to incorporate sectorial differences in intermediate
input shares, which we show are much larger in tradable than in non-tradable sectors.
The extended theory indicates that, if the cost of labor relative to the cost of intermediate
inputs is higher in rich countries, so should be the relative price of non-tradables and the
aggregate price level.
We quantify this mechanism by incorporating differences in input intensities across
tradable and non-tradable sectors into a textbook open economy model.4 In the model,
the relationship between real exchange rate levels and GDP per capita is shaped by three
mechanisms. First, real exchange rates depend on cross-country differences in sectorial
technology, as in the standard Balassa-Samuelson model. As highlighted above, this effect
cannot be quantified directly without data on sectorial productivity levels in each country.5 Second, real exchange rates depend on differences in capital shares across sectors
and cross-country differences in the stock of capital per capita, as proposed by Bhagwati.
Third, real exchange rates are shaped by differences in intermediate input shares across
sectors, coupled with differences in aggregate productivity across countries, as explained
above. Crucially, since the last two mechanisms depend only on sectorial factor and input
intensities, and not on the relative levels of sectorial productivity, they can be quantified
directly using publicly available data.
We show that sectorial differences in intermediate input shares account for about two
thirds of the elasticity of the aggregate price level with respect to GDP per capita. In
particular, we decompose the real exchange rate of each country relative to the US into
three terms capturing the mechanisms described above. Differences in intermediate input
shares across tradable and non-tradable sectors imply an elasticity of the real exchange
rate to GDP per capita of 0.16, more than two thirds of the elasticity of the 0.23 elasticity in Figure 1a.6 The elasticity implied by sectorial differences in capital shares is -0.05.
real exchange rates except in the very long run. See for example De Gregorio et al. (1994), Rogoff (1996),
Tica and Druzic (2006), Lothian and Taylor (2008) and Chong et al. (2012).
4 See for example Obstfeld and Rogoff (1996).
5 In turn, measures of sectorial productivity levels can only be constructed as a residual using data on
sectorial relative price levels, as done by Inklaar and Timmer (2014). In contrast, our mechanism can be
quantified independently of the sectorial price data.
6 Feenstra et al. (2015) obtain similar estimates of this elasticity using data from the PWT 8.0.

2

Contrary to Bhagwati’s hypothesis, the share of capital in gross output is actually larger
in non-tradable than in tradable sectors.7 The residual component of the slope coefficient (0.12) can be attributed to differences in sectorial technologies, as in the BalassaSamuelson model.
Our proposed mechanism has strong implications for the behavior of industry-level
real exchange rates. It implies that, as income increases, industry-level prices should increase relative to the aggregate price of non-tradables for industries where the share of
intermediate inputs is lower than for the non-tradable sector as a whole. We find strong
support for this prediction using detailed industry-level price data from the International
Comparison Program (ICP). We also calibrate the model to the industry-level data and
show that industry-level variation in input shares accounts for a significant fraction of
the observed industry-level real exchange rates. While the Balassa-Samuelson model can
rationalize these industry-level predictions, it can only do so through specific assumptions on how industry-level productivities change with income. Instead, our mechanism
delivers these predictions from observed intermediate input coefficients for different industries.
We note that in our model, even under the assumption that there are no differences in
sectorial technologies across countries, differences in sectorial value-added productivity
across countries arise endogenously from sectorial differences in input shares coupled
with cross-country differences in aggregate productivity. This distinction between grossoutput and value-added productivity does not arise in the textbook Balassa-Samuelson
model without intermediate inputs. However, given value-added productivities in each
country and each sector, the two models have the same predictions for the level of the
real exchange rate. We highlight two advantages of starting from gross-output, rather
than from value-added production functions. First, differences in sectorial value-added
productivities arise endogenously from observed intermediate input shares, so they can
be quantified directly from aggregate data. Second, it facilitates the mapping of the model
to the final expenditure price data which is typically used to compute real exchange rates,
since final prices capture both the cost of value-added and of intermediate inputs.8
Our paper contributes to the long literature that studies the relationship between real
exchange rates and GDP per capita.9 Most of the empirical literature has looked at the re7 In

contrast, the share of capital in value-added is indeed slightly larger in tradable sectors. We note,
however, that real exchange rates are computed using prices of final expenditures, rather than ’valueadded’ prices.
8 Alternatively, one can start from value-added production functions, and work with ’value-added’ price
data. Herrendorf et al. (2013) and Bems and Johnson (Forthcoming) are two recent examples that compute
’value-added’ prices.

lationship between productivity and real exchange rate growth, but in most cases has only
found evidence of a long-run relationship such as cointegration.10 In a recent series of papers, Berka et al. (2012) and Berka et al. (2014) use newly-constructed data on Price Level
Indices for countries in the Euro area to show evidence supporting the Balassa-Samuelson
model. Our paper complements these studies by proposing a mechanism through which
differences in sectorial value-added productivities arise endogenously from the differences in input intensities across sectors, in the spirit of Jones (2011). Since the mechanism
does not require data on the level of sectorial productivity, we can quantify it both in
growth rates and levels for a broad set of countries.11
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 uses a simple model to illustrate
our main results relating real exchange rate levels to GDP per capita. Section 3 describes
a more detailed model incorporating capital as a factor of production and a richer inputoutput structure and that will be used for our quantification. Section 4 describes the data.
Section 5 presents the quantitative results, and Section 6 concludes.

Intermediate input shares and sectorial relative prices

This section develops a simple model to show how sectorial differences in intermediate
input shares can shape the relation between real exchange rates and GDP per capita.
Consider a small open economy that produces two goods, tradables and non-tradables,
using labor and intermediate inputs. For the moment, assume that production does not
use intermediate inputs that are produced in other sectors.12 The price of tradables is
equalized across countries and set as the numeraire, P T = 1 . The production function for
good j is given by:

recent evidence based on the new ICP data. Bergin et al. (2006) explain why the observed relation between
real exchange rate levels and GDP per capita may have changed through time.
10 See for example Asea and Mendoza (1994), De Gregorio et al. (1994), Canzoneri et al. (1999) and Lee
and Tang (2007).
11 A related literature starting with Engel (1999) has focused on the relative price of tradable goods in
accounting for in real exchange rates (see for example Burstein et al. (2003), Betts and Kehoe (2008), Drozd
and Nosal (2012) among many others). While a significant part of the measured movement in the relative
price of tradables can be attributed to the retail component of tradable prices, Burstein and Gopinath (2015)
show that movements in RERs for tradable goods measured using border prices still account for about 30
percent of the movements in real exchange rates. Since our main focuse is on cross-sectional departures
from PPP, we concentrate on the relative price of non-tradable goods, a view supported by Berka and
Devereux (2013) and Feenstra et al. (2015) among others, and by the evidence in Figure 1b.
12 That is, non-tradables are not used in the production of tradables, and vice-versa.

the rest of the world. Noting that GDP per capita in this economy is given by the wage,

Equation (2) relates relative price levels to cross-country differences in relative sectorial productivities and cross-country differences in GDP per capita.14 It postulates that
the price level should be higher in countries that are relatively more productive in the
tradable sector (high a T ). In the Balassa-Samuelson model, it is assumed that a T is relatively high in rich countries, which leads to a positive correlation between the relative
price level and GDP per capita. The equation also shows that, if the share of value-added
is larger in non-tradable sectors, θ N > θ T , prices should be higher in countries with a
high level of GDP per capita, even if there are no cross-country differences in sectorial
productivity ∆a T = 0.

Value-added production functions and mapping to the Balassa-Samuelson model We
can write the production functions in this model in value-added, rather than in grossoutput terms. Substituting intermediate input demands into the value-added production
functions, V j ≡ θ j Y j , we obtain
V j = Bj Lj,

(3)

1

where B j ≡ ZA j θ j .15 The equation shows that even if there are no differences in grossoutput productivity across sectors, A j = 1, sectorial differences in value-added productivity, B j , can arise endogenously from differences in the share of intermediate inputs in
production, θ j . The intuition for this result is that, as noted by Jones (2011), intermediate
inputs deliver a multiplier similar to the multiplier associated with capital in the neoclassical growth model. If the multiplier is greater in the tradable sector, θ T < θ N , this implies
that a given increase in aggregate productivity Z has a larger impact in tradable than in
non-tradable output.
This observation makes clear that the theoretical predictions of the model for the real
exchange rate are isomorphic to a Balassa-Samuelson model with production functions
given by equation (3). We highlight two important advantages of incorporating sectorial
differences in intermediate-input shares explicitly in the model. First, while the BalassaSamuelson model simply assumes how differences in sectorial productivities change with
development (i.e. the model assumes a correlation between B T /B N and GDP per capita),
these differences can also arise endogenously from differences in the intermediate input
shares across sectors and differences in aggregate productivity Z across countries. Perhaps more importantly, differences in the relative level of productivity across sectors and
countries are not measured by statistical agencies -i.e. neither A T nor B T is measured
in levels- which makes it virtually impossible to directly quantify the Balassa-Samuelson
hypothesis in levels. In contrast, differences in the share of intermediate inputs across sectors are easily quantifiable, so the input multiplier channel can be directly quantified.16 A
back of the envelope calculation using equation (2) reveals that this channel is potentially
large: using US values for θ N = 0.61, θ T = 0.35, and ω = 0.84, indicates that, given relative sectorial productivities, the elasticity of the relative price level of GDP with respect
to relative GDP per capita is 0.38 vs. 0.23 in the data in Figure 1a. The remainder of the


follows from the input demands that minimize costs, M j = 1 − θ j Z Ā j θ j L j .
16 Another, often overlooked limitation of specifying the production function in value-added terms is
that in the data real exchange rates are typically computed from prices of final expenditures, rather than
from ’value-added’ prices An important exception is Bems and Johnson (Forthcoming) who estimate of
value-added real exchange rates.
15 This

paper measures the importance of this channel in a more detailed quantitative framework
that incorporates capital as a factor of production, allows for multiple non-tradable sectors and a richer input-output structure, and allows for differences in factor shares across
countries.

Quantitative framework

We now extend the simple model from Section 2 to incorporate capital as a factor of production and to allow for a more realistic input-output structure and for differences in
factor shares across countries. In addition, we incorporate multiple non-tradable industries to derive predictions for industry-level real exchange rates.17 We thus consider a
small open economy that produces J + 1 of goods, j = 1, ..., J which are non-tradable and
j = J + 1 which is tradable, using labor, capital, and intermediate inputs. We index the
tradable good by T, while the remaining J goods can be grouped in a non-tradable sector
labeled by N. The price of the tradable good is equalized across countries and taken as
the numeraire, PtT = 1. All markets are perfectly competitive.

17 As it will become apparent below, this will allow us to evaluate which non-tradable industries become
more expensive as GDP per capita grows.

where gdpi is the log of GDP per capita measured in units of the tradable good, k i is the
log of the capital-labor ratio in the economy, and aiT captures country-specific productivity
differences across the two sectors.19 Equation (6) links the price of non-tradables to GDP
per capita and the capital-labor ratio in the economy. The equation shows that, if the share
of intermediate inputs in gross output is relatively high in the tradable sector, θiN > θiT , the
price of non-tradables increases with GDP per capita. Intuitively, as productivity grows,
labor gets more expensive relative to intermediate inputs, which increases the price in
sectors that use labor more intensively. In addition, if the non-tradable sector uses capital
more intensively, αiN θiN > αiT θiT , the price of non-tradables decreases with the capitallabor ratio in the economy, k i .
Decomposing real exchange rates We now decompose the determinants of bilateral
real exchange rates in the model. To facilitate comparisons with the data in Figure 1a
we define the real exchange rate as the price level of GDP in each country relative to the
US. The log of the price level of GDP in country i is defined as pi = ωiN piN , where ωiN
denotes the share of non-tradables in country i’s GDP. Letting ∆xi ≡ xi − xus denote the
log difference of a variable relative to the US, we can write the log-price of GDP in country
i relative to the US, qi ≡ ωiN ∆piN , as:20

Equation (7) decomposes cross-country differences in the price level into three terms. The
first term, labeled ’Intermediate Inputs’, captures the differences in aggregate price levels
that arise from sectorial differences in intermediate input shares coupled with differences
in GDP per capita across countries. It states that, if the share of intermediate inputs is
larger in the tradable sector, θiN > θiT , countries with higher GDP per capita should have
a higher price level. This effect is the main focus of this paper and is measured in the
quantitative section below.
The second term, labeled ’Capital-Deepening’, captures how cross-country differences
in the capital-labor ratio affect relative price levels, and states that the relative price level
should increase with the capital-labor ratio if the production of tradables is more intensive in capital αiT θiT > αiN θiN . This mechanism was first highlighted by Bhagwati (1984).
Note that if the share of value-added in the tradable sector is low enough, the price level
can actually decrease with the capital-labor ratio even if the capital share in value-added
is higher in the tradable sector αiT > αiN . Indeed, in contrast to what is postulated in
Bhagwati (1984), αiT θiT < αiN θiN for the vast majority of countries for which input-output
data are available.
Finally, the ’Balassa-Samuelson’ term captures differences in the price level that arise
from cross-country differences in sectorial technology, which encompass both cross-country
differences in the relative level of sectorial productivity, ĀiT , and cross-country differences

in sectorial factor shares αi , θi , and θ̄iN . Note that this term cannot be measured directly
from national accounts data, as it requires not only data on the relative level of sectorial
productivity, ĀiT , but also data on the level of US GDP measured in units of tradables
(which requires taking a stand on the level of the dollar price of tradable goods).

Industry-level real exchange rates

We now derive the model’s implications for industry-level real exchange rates. From
equations (5) and (6) we can write the price of any non-tradable good j as:

Equation (8) states that the slope of the industry-level real exchange rate with respect

average price of non-tradables, relative to the US as:

Data

To evaluate the relation between relative prices and GDP per capita derived in equations
(7), (8), and (9) we need data on relative price levels, GDP per capita, and the stock of
capital per capita across countries. We also need to assign values to the share of valuej
added in gross output for each country and sector, θi , the labor share in each country and
j0 j

j

sector, 1 − αi , the intermediate inputs shares, σi , and the share of non-tradables in GDP,
ωiN .
Relative price levels, GDP per capita and capital-labor ratio: We take GDP per capita
at market prices from the World Development Indicators Tables (WDI). Data on relative
prices come from the Penn World Table 9.0 (PWT). Our baseline relative price measure is
the price level index of GDP relative to the US, which is variable PL_GDPo in the PWT.21
We focus on a subsample of 168 countries for which we have data in both the PWT and
WDI. We construct GDP per capita at PPP dollars from the PWT by taking the ratio of real
21 See

Feenstra et al. (2015) for a description of the new PWT.

11

GDP at constant 2011 national prices (variable RDGP N A in the PWT) to population. For
the stock of capital per capita, we use the capital stock in PPP dollars (variable RK N A ).
When looking at growth rates, we compute the growth rates of these per capita variables.
We complement these data with the benchmark ICP 2011 data containing sector-specific
price level indices and expenditure shares.22
Input shares and sectorial weights: Input-output coefficients come from the OECD
Inter-Country Input-Output (ICIO) Tables, which provide input-output tables for 61 countries between 1995-2011. We classify sectors in the ICIO and the ICP into tradables and
j
non-tradables following Crucini et al. (2005).23 We compute θi as the ratio of value-added
j0 j

to gross output in each sector, and the parameters σi as the ratio of the value of inputs
from sector j0 to the total value of inputs used in sector j.
j
Unfortunately, the shares of labor compensation in value-added, 1 − αi , are not directly observable in the ICIO tables. In particular, I-O tables report the share of compensation to employees relative to value-added for each sector. It is well known that compensation to employees understates labor compensation as it does not include payments to
self-employed workers.24 The PWT adjusts the labor income of employees to account for
the income of self-employed workers to obtain an aggregate measure of the labor share.
We follow this approach and rescale the sectorial ratios of compensation to employees to
value-added that we observe in the ICIO to match the aggregate labor shares reported in
the PWT. In particular, for each country in the ICIO we compute
j

1 − αi

(10)

where the sectorial and aggregate ratios of compensation to employees to value-added
come from the ICIO, and the aggregate ratio of labor compensation to value-added is
obtained from the PWT. For countries not available in the ICIO tables, we impute the
j
j0 j
cross-country average of the observed θi , σi and compensation-to-employees-to-valueadded ratio, and use equation (10) to obtain sectorial measures of the labor share that
are consistent with the PWT. In all cases, we use the shares as measured in 2011. The
industries in ICIO are mapped to the industries in the ICP program with the concordance
in Appendix Table A1. We compute the share of non-tradables in GDP, ωiN , from the

the benchmark PLIs in the detailed ICP data are defined relative to the world, we divide by the
US PLIs to work with price indices of consumption relative to the US.

program.
j
Appendix Table A2 reports the share of value-added in gross output, θi , for the countries in our sample. Non-tradable sectors are significatively more labor intensive than
tradable sectors for every country in the sample. For the average country, the share of
value-added in gross output in tradable sectors is about half than in the non-tradable
sectors (0.33 vs 0.54).
Finally, we compute the share of non-tradables in GDP, ωiN , as the ratio of value-added
in the non-tradable sector to total value-added. Appendix Table A3 reports the division
of the ICIO industries into tradable and non-tradable sectors. Within the non-tradable
j
sector, industry-specific ωi ’s are computed as the ratio value-added between industry j
to total value-added in the non-tradable sector.

Quantitative results

This section uses the framework in Section 3 to disentangle the sources of the crosscountry relation between real exchange rate levels and GDP per capita. First, we use
equation (7) to evaluate how much of the observed differences in price levels across countries can be accounted for by sectorial differences in intermediate input shares coupled
with cross-country differences in GDP per capita. Second, we use equations (8) and (9)
to test the industry-level predictions of this mechanism. Third, we show that the results
of this section are unchanged if we instead focus on the relation between price levels and
GDP per capita measured at PPP prices, the relation between the growth of the price level
and real GDP per capita across countries, and in a version of the model where tradable
goods are differentiated across countries.

5.1

Price levels and GDP per capita

We first decompose the relation between aggregate price levels and GDP per capita following the decomposition in Section 3. In particular, for each country i, we compute
the terms labeled ’Intermediate Inputs’ and ’Capital-Deepening’ in equation (7), given by




ωiN θiN − θiT /θ̄iN ∆gdpi and ωiN αiT θiT − αiN θiN /θ̄iN ∆k i respectively. Subtracting these
two terms from the observed relative price levels we can obtain the ’Balassa-Samuelson’
term as a residual.
Figure 2 shows the results of this decomposition by plotting the ’Intermediate Inputs’

13

and ’Capital-Deepening’ terms along with the relative price levels observed in the data.25
The relation between aggregate price levels and GDP per capita can be mostly attributed
to sectorial differences in intermediate inputs shares, captured by the term labeled ’Intermediate Inputs’. This term gives an elasticity of the relative price level with respect to
GDP per capita of 0.16, more than two thirds of the 0.23 aggregate elasticity observed in
the data. In contrast, sectorial differences in the share of capital in gross output, captured
by the ’Capital-Deepening’ term, generate a small but negative elasticity of the price to
GDP per capita of -0.05. This is due to the fact that, in contrast to the postulate of Bhagwati
(1984), in the data the share of capital in gross output is higher in non-tradable sectors,
that is, αiT θiT < αiN θiN , even though αiT > αiN . The residual variation in real exchange rate
levels can be attributed to sectorial differences in technology, captured in the ’BalassaSamuelson’ term. Appendix Figure A.1 shows that this term gives an elasticity of the
price level to GDP per capita of 0.12.

Figure 3 reports the contribution the Intermediate Inputs and the ’Capital-Deepening’
terms to the real exchange rate in the median country of our sample. Sectorial differences
in input shares account for about half of the level of the real exchange rate relative to the
US in the median country. We conclude that sectorial differences in intermediate input

5.2

Industry-level real exchange rates

The mechanism highlighted in this paper makes sharp predictions for the behavior of
industry-level relative prices. There is wide variation in the share of intermediate inputs
across non-tradable industries. Appendix Table A2 shows the average share of intermediate inputs in gross output for the countries in ICIO for 7 non-tradable sub-sectors
for which the ICP reports detailed price indexes.26 The share of intermediate inputs in
Education, Health, and Recreation is lower than for the non-tradable sector as a whole,
and is higher in Transport, Communication, and Restaurants. An implication that can be
gleaned from equation (8) is that the slope of the price level of an industry with respect
to GDP per capita should be higher the higher is the share of value-added in the industry
j
(i.e. the higher is θi ).
We first evaluate this prediction by running a regression of industry-level real-exchange
rates on relative GDP per capita and an interaction of GDP per capita with the value26 Appendix

Table A2 also reports these shares for each country in our sample.

15

j

added share of the sector θi .27 We expect the coefficient on the interaction term to be
positive: the slope of the of the industry-level real exchange rate should be higher in industries for which the share of value-added is high (and the share of intermediate inputs
is low). Table 1 supports this result. The first column shows a significant positive relation
between the industry-level real exchange rates and GDP per capita, similar in magnitude
to the aggregate slope in Figure 1a. The second column adds the interaction of GDP per
capita and the sectorial value-added share. The coefficient on the interaction term is positive and strongly statistically significant, in line with the predictions of our mechanisms.
Moreover, the R-squared of the regression increases from 0.266 to 0.476 once we add the
interaction term, indicating that sectorial input shares are important for understanding
the variation in industry-level prices. Column 3 adds country-level fixed effects, so that
the interaction term is identified from the variation in value-added shares across sectors
within countries, and shows that the interaction terms is very similar under this specification. Finally, the last column includes industry-level fixed effects.28 We continue to find
a positive and significant coefficient in this specification. We conclude that the reduced
form evidence brings strong support for the notion that sectorial differences in intermediate input shares shape the relation between real exchange rates and GDP per capita.
We then decompose industry-level real exchange rates by computing the terms labeled
’Intermediate Inputs’ and ’Capital-Deepening’ in equation (8) for seven expenditure categories for which the ICP reports price data. Figure 3 shows that, in the median country of
the sample, the ’Intermediate Inputs’ term accounts for a sizable fraction of the industrylevel real exchange rate in most industries. Figure 4 shows that industry-level differences
in intermediate input shares account for a significant fraction of the relation between
industry-level real exchange rates and GDP per capita. This shows that the mechanism is
quantitatively important in accounting for the real exchange rates industry-by-industry.
Finally, equation (9) implies that as GDP per capita grows, industry-level prices should
increase relative to the aggregate price of non-tradables for industries where the share of
intermediate inputs is lower than for the non-tradable sector as a whole, θ j > θ N . Figure
5 evaluates how the price of each industry relative to the aggregate price of non-tradables

changes across countries in the data and in the model without cross-country differences
in industry-level technology. In particular, we compare data on relative prices to the sum
of first two terms in equation (9), ignoring the ’Balassa-Samuelson’ term. Despite the fact
that the mapping between the industry categories in the ICIO and the expenditure categories in the ICP data is imperfect, the figure shows that industry-level differences in
input shares generates the observed ranking of the relative price changes for the Health,
Education, Transport, Restaurants and Construction. In contrast, the industry-level differences in input shares do not generate much variation across countries in the prices of
Recreation and Communication relative to the price of non-tradables. Overall, the mechanism is successful in matching the relation of industry-level real exchange rates and GDP
per capita.

Real exchange rates and GDP growth

We now evaluate the model’s prediction for the growth of the real exchange rate. Taking

Equation (12) establishes that, if θiN > θiT , fast growing countries should appreciate . Appendix Figure A.3 compares the terms in equation (12) to the growth of the real exchange
rate observed in the data. The figure shows that sectorial differences in input shares account for about three-quarters of the elasticity of the growth of the real exchange rate to
the growth or real GDP over the 1997-2014 period.
5.3.3

Alternative classifications of the tradable sector

This section re-evaluates the results of Section 5.1 under an alternative classification of
industries into tradables and non-tradables. In particular, we follow the macro-economic

20

database of the European Commission’s Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs (AMECO) and classify the Wholesale and Retail Trade, Hotels, Restaurants,
Transport, Utility, and Storage industries as tradables. Figure A.4 in the appendix plots
the decomposition of equation (7) using this classification. The figure shows that differences in intermediate input shares still account for about half the slope of the relation
between the real exchange rate and GDP per capita using this alternative classification.
5.3.4

Multiple tradable goods

Finally, we show how to extend our baseline model to allow for differentiated tradable
goods. In particular, assume that tradable goods are differentiated by country of origin.

decomposition in (16), we obtain the relative price of tradables that is consistent with the
model and with data on trade flows. In particular, we use equation (15) to write:

(17)

Here si ≡ [1 − ρ] logϕi and dn ≡ [ρ − 1] logϕn can be estimated by OLS regression from
equation (17) as source and destination dummies under the restriction that si = −di . The
bilateral preference term ωni can be obtained as the residual of this regression. Using the
estimates on si , we recover the prices ϕi by setting an elasticity of substitution of ρ = 6,
consistent with a trade elasticity of 5 as obtained from Eaton and Kortum (2002). Finally,
using these estimates, PiT can be then recovered from equation (14). Appendix A details
this estimation and plots the decomposition of equation (16) for countries in the WIOD.
It shows that the sectorial differences in input shares are still important in accounring for
the elasticity of the real exchange rate with respect to GDP per capita.

Conclusion

This paper proposes a mechanism to account for the relation between real exchange rates
and GDP per capita. If the share of intermediate inputs in the production of tradables is
relatively high and the price of tradables is equalized across countries, the price of nontradables should increase with GDP per capita. The intuition is that the input multiplier
will be larger for tradables in this case. Since this mechanism acts independently of the
differences in the level of productivities across sectors, it can be easily evaluated using
input-output data. We show that differences in input shares across tradable and nontradable sectors can account for about a third of the elasticity of the real exchange rates to
income per capita.

A.1

Armington Model

Setup

Preliminaries: We consider a world economy with I countries indexed by i and n. Each
country produces 2 goods indexed by j = T, N. Production uses labor, capital, and intermediate inputs. Tradable goods are differentiated by country of origin. We index the
tradable goods by T, while the remaining J goods can be grouped in a non-tradable sector
labeled by N. Each country is endowed with Ki and Li efficiency units of capital and labor,
respectively. The final output of each sector can be used for consumption or as an intermediate input in the production of any sector. All factor and goods markets are perfectly
competitive.
Preferences:

The utility of the representative household in country i is given by
Ci = CiT 1−γi CiN γi ,

(A.1)

where CiT is a bundle of tradable goods from different source countries, and CiN is a bundle of non-tradables produced in country i. The household’s budget constraint is given
by
Wi Li + Ri Ki = Pi Ci + Pi I i + NX i ≡ GDPi .
(A.2)
−γ

Here, Wi and Ri denote the wages and the return to capital, and Pi ≡ γi i (1 − γi )γi −1 PiT 1−γi PiN γi
is the price level of GDP. Ii denotes total investment. NXi are net transfers from country i
to the rest of the world, which for the purpose of our exercise are an exogenous fraction of
GDPi , that is NXi ≡ nxi GDPi . Note that if nxi < 0 the country is running a trade deficit.
We can re-write this equation as:

[ Pi Ci + Pi I i ] = GDPi [1 − nxi ] .

Note that, after choosing the numeraire, 20 × I − 1 + I 2 variables must be determined in equilibrium. Equations (A.2) and (A.6)-(A.25) give a system of 20 × I −
1 + I 2 independent equations, since the market clearing conditions together with
the budget constraints make one budget constraint redundant.

A.2

Relative prices and GDP per capita

We now evaluate the relation between relative prices and GDP per capita in this model.
Combining equations (A.11) and (A.12) we can write the relative price of non-tradables
to tradables as:

Note that the terms [1 − ρ] logϕiT and [1 − ρ] logϕnT are constant across source countries
and destination countries respectively, and can be estimated by OLS using source and
destination country dummies. With this in mind, we obtain the relative price of tradables
by estimating equation (A.26) under the restriction si = −di by OLS. We then recover the

and using an elasticity of substitution of ρ = 6, consistent with a trade elasticity of 5, as

from the residuals in the regression. The we can recover the relative price of tradables by
plugging ϕ̂iT and ω̂ in in equation (A.10). The decomposition in equation (16) is plotted in
