ABSTRACT
If health service delivery is poorly managed, then increases in inputs or ability may not translate
into gains in quality. However, little is known about how to increase managerial capital to
generate persistent improvements in quality. We present results from a randomized field
experiment in 80 primary health care centers (PHCs) in Nigeria to evaluate the effects of a health
care management consulting intervention. One set of PHCs received a detailed improvement plan
and nine months of implementation support (full intervention), another set received only a
general training session, an overall assessment and a report with improvement advice (light
intervention), and a third set of facilities served as a control group. In the short term, the full
intervention had large and significant effects on the adoption of several practices under the direct
control of the PHC staff, as well as some intermediate outcomes. Virtually no effects remained
one year after the intervention concluded. The light intervention showed no consistent effects at
either point. We conclude that sustained supervision is crucial for achieving persistent
improvements in contexts where the lack of external competition fails to create incentives for the
adoption of effective managerial practices.

1. Introduction
In recent years, improving the quality of health care provision – beyond merely making it available –
has become a higher priority for the World Health Organization (WHO) and other health agencies
(WHO 2006; Institute of Medicine, 2001; Das et al. 2008). Recent research suggests that
improvements in outcomes may not always require significant infusions of additional resources. In
wealthy economies, a wide dispersion in health outcomes remains after controlling for access,
spending and other structural aspects of quality (Chandra et al. 2013; Skinner 2011). The idea that
improvements in health care quality can be achieved without increasing the recurrent resources
employed can be particularly appealing to resource-constrained developing countries. At the same
time, a recent and growing literature suggests that managerial and organizational practices matter
greatly for organizational productivity and outcomes (Bloom, Sadun and Van Reenen 2012; Bloom,
Eifert, Mahajan, McKenzie and Roberts. 2013), including in the health care sector (Bloom, Sadun and
Van Reenen 2014), and that differences in management practices across organizations and countries
account for a large share of the dispersion in productivity not explained by the quantity and quality of
the inputs used. In fact, Brun, Karlan, and Schoar (2013) suggest that the lack of managerial and
organizational capital may be a key constraint to productivity growth in developing countries. If so,
then simply increasing the quantity of inputs may not translate into improved quality of health care:
Das and Hammer (2014) find “no correlation between structural inputs and practice quality” across a
number of studies, and Das et al. (2012) find that differences in levels of medical training of caregivers
account for small or no differences in the quality of provided care. Improving the management of
health facilities holds the promise of improving the quality of care and increasing the returns to other
inputs.
The empirical literature on the role of “managerial” or “organizational” capital on the quality of
health care delivery in developing countries is still scarce and, to our knowledge, limited to hospitals
(Bloom, Sadun and Van Reenen 2014). However, the typical first point of access to care in developing
countries is primary health centers (PHCs). The expansion of PHCs has been a crucial component of
many developing countries’ strategies to expand access to care to their populations, especially in rural
areas. However, despite the expansion of PHCs, the quality of health care delivery in developing
countries remains low (Das and Hammer 2014; Strasser, Kam and Regalado 2016).
In this paper, we present results from a randomized field experiment conducted in partnership
with the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) to evaluate the effects of a health care
management consulting program for public PHCs in six Nigerian states. The FMOH contracted
SafeCare, an international agency that specializes in health care quality standards and patient safety in
developing-country contexts, to (i) provide a general training session to representatives from the
PHCs, (ii) conduct baseline quality assessments at each PHC accompanied by a brief report, (iii) assist
the PHCs’ staff in formulating improvement plans, and (iv) provide periodical feedback and support
toward implementation of the plans for the duration of nine months. The assessment and plans focused
on a set of organizational and managerial practices that comprise basic international standards for

2

running primary health care facilities, ranging from the management of human resources, information,
and risk, to the organization of the pharmacy and management of the drug inventory.1
An independent evaluation of the SafeCare intervention is policy-relevant in its own right, as
many countries across Africa – including Ghana, Kenya, Namibia, Tanzania and Uganda – are
working with this agency to improve standards of care at primary and secondary health care facilities
(SafeCare 2017). However, our experimental design allows us to go beyond a simple program
evaluation. In particular, we distinguish between different mechanisms through which a management
consulting intervention can affect practices and outcomes.
Of the 80 facilities included in the study, 24 were randomly assigned to receive the full treatment
described above; 24 to receive a light, information-only treatment consisting of (i) a general training
session to PHC representatives and (ii) a baseline quality assessment and a brief report highlighting
basic improvement areas and actions, but without a detailed improvement plan and without any
additional feedback and support; and 32 to a control group. Comparing the full and the light
interventions allows us to identify whether the main barriers to improving practices and quality of care
are information constraints or implementation constraints. In the first case, the staff lacks knowledge
of the appropriate or recommended organizational and operational practices, and providing that
information (the light treatment) should improve practices. On the other hand, if the principal barrier
to improvement is an implementation constraint – i.e., the staff lack the capacity to implement the
changes, whether because of a lack of management ability or a lack of attention due to competing tasks
– then information plus continued coaching and monitoring have the potential to improve practices.
To distinguish between management ability and attention, in addition to collecting data
periodically during the implementation phase and immediately after its completion, we gathered data
one year after the end of the intervention. Results from this long-term evaluation reveal whether the
intervention had lasting effects and – importantly – demonstrate the relative importance of
implementation support versus monitoring. Persistent impacts would suggest that initial
implementation support improved management ability, which endured beyond the period of support.
Short-run impacts with no long-run impacts would suggest that a lack of consistent attention to quality
improvements is the binding constraint and that ongoing monitoring is key to sustained improvements.
Testing the effects of monitoring is particularly important in this public sector context where the lack
of competition implies that incentives to adopt superior organizational practices are essentially nonexistent for the facilities’ officers-in-charge.
Although the ultimate objective of better standards of care is to improve health outcomes, the
scale of this program was insufficient to allow us to detect meaningful changes in outcomes such as
infant or maternal mortality or infections. Because the focus of the intervention was to improve
practices, our main outcome variables of interest relate to the adoption by the PHCs of the
recommended organizational standards. We also measured several intermediate outcomes that should
be affected by the improved practices, and that are demonstrated to impact health outcomes in other
1

SafeCare is an agency created as part of a collaboration between the Joint Commission International based in the US,
PharmAccess Foundation of the Netherlands, and the Council for Health Service Accreditation of Southern Africa
established to “address issues of poor and limited health care delivered in developing countries.” The SafeCare standards
were accredited by the International Society for Quality in Health Care in March of 2013 (SafeCare 2013).

contexts. One organizational standard was to organize drugs and vaccines in the drug storeroom by
type, using labels and ordering them by expiration date. An organized pharmacy should reduce the
likelihood of stock-outs, improving the PHCs’ ability to provide patients with essential drugs and
vaccines, thereby improving the recovery chances of sick patients and immunization rates. In our
study, we observe how the pharmacy is organized (practice adoption) and stock-outs of essential drugs
and vaccines (intermediate outcomes), which are necessary conditions for improvements in actual
health outcomes. Another intermediate outcome is the observed cleanliness of the PHC. Finally, we
also measured patient experience and satisfaction through patient exit interviews. One of the Nigerian
government’s goals with this intervention was to encourage more people to seek care in the public
PHCs: Higher patient satisfaction might improve the PHC’s reputation in the community and thus
contribute to increased access.
The full intervention had large and significant effects on the adoption of several organizational
practices that were under the direct control of the facilities’ staff. These included practices that required
a minimal, one-time effort exertion such as displaying posters with hand-washing guidelines or having
clearly marked waste bins for different types of waste, but also practices that required moderate and
sustained effort such as labeling and organizing drugs in the pharmacy by expiration date or making
hand-washing supplies consistently available in the consulting room and in other key areas of the
facility. We also detected economically and statistically significant effects on some intermediate
outcomes, including cleanliness of toilets and waiting rooms. In contrast, the light intervention had no
systematic effects; in most cases, the estimated coefficients were both economically and statistically
insignificant, indicating no meaningful differences with the control group.
Because we are considering many outcomes, we perform corrections for Multiple Hypothesis
Testing (Anderson 2008; List, Shaikh and Xu 2016). Specifically, we combine outcomes into broad
indices (z-scores), thereby reducing the number of tests being performed, and we also compute Family
Wise Error Rate-adjusted and False Discovery Rate-adjusted p-values of the individual outcome
estimated coefficients. The results are robust to these corrections.
When we measured practices and intermediate outcomes one year after the end of the
intervention, however, we found that almost all of these effects had disappeared. Taken together, the
two treatments and the short-term and long-term effects indicate that, first, information alone on what
practices should be adopted is not sufficient; results are obtained only when detailed information on
what changes need to occur is combined with sustained implementation support and monitoring.
Second, the lack of long-term effects – despite the fact that about 70% of the core staff who were
employed in the PHCs at the time of the intervention were still present one year later – suggests that
monitoring during implementation played a crucial role. Third, the results are also informative about
the nature of “adjustment costs,” which have been emphasized as a reason why organizations are often
reluctant to adopt new, more efficient practices (Bloom, Sadun and Van Reenen 2013): the
intervention failed to produce sustainable changes, but it did result in measurable changes in practices
during the “implementation support” phase; this suggests that adjustment costs might be best viewed
and modeled as variable costs rather than one-time fixed costs.

4

Finally, we found no effects on practices that required substantial additional effort on the part of
staff, infrastructure investments, or support from and coordination with government agencies (e.g.,
consistent access to power). This is not surprising, but it underlines the fact that improved management
and organizational processes are insufficient to solve the major infrastructural constraints faced in
many PHCs around the world. A lack of incentives may also contribute to explain the absence of
effects for organizational practices requiring considerable additional and continued effort on the part
of the staff.
Our study makes several contributions. Our main contribution is to the literature on the adoption
of organizational and managerial practices with what we believe is the first evidence from primary
health care facilities in a developing country context. Although in recent years evidence has
accumulated indicating that management practices have important effects on productivity, the
mechanisms through which superior practices are adopted and the barriers to their adoption are still
poorly understood. The profit motive can explain why managers in market contexts adopt better
practices upon learning about them (Bloom et al. 2013). However, in many contexts the profit motive
is absent. In the health care sector in particular, public providers play a central role in many countries,
often with limited competition from private providers. Our experiment demonstrates whether and how
better managerial and organizational practices can be adopted by staff in public health care facilities.
Specifically, our design distinguishes between the effects of information, implementation support, and
supervision on the adoption of practices in the short term and in the long term. Moreover, we advance
the empirical literature on health care quality in developing countries, by providing evidence on the
effects of a policy-relevant intervention that several governments, particularly in African countries,
are adopting to achieve improvements. Previous literature on improving health care quality examines
non-managerial policies—including legal mandates, accreditation and administrative regulations,
professional oversight, national and local guidelines, information sharing, and incentive provision—
with mixed results (Peabody et al., 2006). Even when existing studies report positive results of
interventions aimed at improving organizational and individual performance in adopting standards,
they have significant design limitations, often focusing on longitudinal change without a credible
control group.2 This makes interpretation of the results problematic. Moreover, the interventions
typically have multiple components without a design that allows for the effects of the various
components to be assessed separately. In contrast with the existing health care management literature,
the randomized-controlled nature of our study allows clearer causal inferences, and our experimental
and data collection design allow us to distinguish the effects of different components of the
intervention.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we describe the context and
provide details on the SafeCare program. In Section 3 we describe our experimental design and
research questions, and in Section 4 we discuss the data and estimation strategy. We present the results

2. The Nigerian Context and the Program
2.1 Health and Health Care in Nigeria
Nigeria has a population of almost 186 million and a per capita income of US$2,178 ($5,867 when
adjusted for purchasing power parity). The country’s total health expenditures amount to 3.7 percent
of GDP. Life expectancy at birth is 53 years. Even though life expectancy has increased in the past
decade, it is still 12 years shorter than the average among countries in the same income group (World
Bank 2016).3 The main causes of death in Nigeria are lower respiratory infections (14%), HIV/AIDS
(10.4%), malaria (8.7%), diarrheal diseases (6.3%), pre-term birth complications (4.7%) and birth
asphyxia and birth trauma (4.3%) (WHO 2015).
In 2013, the under-five mortality rate was about 120 per 1000 live births (WHO 2015). About a
quarter of all under-five deaths are accounted for by deaths of newborn babies. The leading cause of
under-5 death is malaria (21%), followed by acute respiratory infections (15%), prematurity (12%),
birth asphyxia (10%), diarrhea (10%), and neonatal sepsis (5%). In the same year, maternal mortality
was 560 deaths per 100,000 live births. Many deaths could be prevented by simple, essential
interventions reaching women and children on time, for example with antenatal care, vaccination, and
timely diagnosis of treatable infectious diseases such as malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea, and measles.
Improved quality of health care delivery at primary health care facilities is one important vehicle to
achieve better health outcomes (WHO 2006).
Nigeria’s large population means that it accounts for a large share of total deaths in the African
continent and worldwide. For example, in 2013 Nigeria alone accounted for about 14 percent of the
total number of maternal deaths, 13 percent of under-five deaths and 10 percent of neonatal deaths
worldwide (UNICEF 2014). Thus, even small reductions in mortality rates through improvements in
the quality of health services could result in large reductions in the absolute number of lives saved.
For example, a one percent reduction in the under-five mortality rate would save the lives of about
8,000 children under the age of five every year in Nigeria.
The intervention we evaluate in this paper was part of a broader set of actions implemented by
the Nigerian government between 2011 and 2015 with the overarching goal of improving health care
access and quality. The Health Strategy and Delivery Foundation (HSDF), a not-for-profit
organization, partnered with the FMOH to develop a National Framework for Quality Improvement.4
The FMOH partnered with the World Bank in the assessment of quality of service across primary,
secondary and tertiary facilities nationwide. In addition, the FMOH set an agenda to improve the
delivery of primary health care services around the country through its Subsidy Reinvestment and
Empowerment Program – Maternal and Child Health component (SURE-P MCH), by improving
staffing and upgrading primary health care facilities and increasing usage of MCH services through a
Nigeria is classified as a “lower middle income” country by the World Bank. Life expectancy at birth for all lower
middle income countries is 67.4 years.

quality strategy across primary, secondary, and tertiary care facilities. Thus, in 2013, the FMOH
implemented a management intervention to build local capacity and improve quality of care through
the organization SafeCare, in partnership with HSDF.

2.2 The SafeCare Program
Formed in 2001, SafeCare is an agency specializing in producing and assessing quality standards
specific to resource-constrained public and private health care facilities of all kinds. These include
tertiary (teaching) hospitals, referral hospitals, district hospitals, primary health centers (as in our
case), basic health centers, and health shops or nurse-driven clinics. SafeCare also offers technical
assistance, or consulting, with a focus on building knowledge to guide and facilitate the adoption of
quality standards.
The SafeCare standards are grouped in 13 “service elements” in four broad areas: health care
organization management, care of patients, specialized services, and ancillary services (Table 1). The
service elements encompass the entire range of clinical services, including management of human
resources, information and risk, logistics and management of medication, and laboratory and facility
services, among others. For each service element, SafeCare has developed a set of indicators for
specific standards or managerial/organizational practices or actions. The SafeCare standards were
accredited by the International Society for Quality in Health Care in March of 2013 (SafeCare 2013).
The full set of standards can be found in SafeCare (2015).
The SafeCare program consists of the following five components:
(1) General training session: SafeCare conducted an initial 2-day general training session attended by
one point person from each PHC. The attendees were trained in standard best practices according
to the SafeCare model.
(2) Baseline assessment and gap analysis: SafeCare personnel visit each PHC and make a detailed
assessment. Specifically, for each of 823 standards in health care organization management, care
of patients, specialized services, and ancillary services, SafeCare gives a score to the facility
ranging from 5 points (“not compliant, very serious”) to 100 points (“compliant”).5
(3) Initial feedback: Based on the outcome of the assessment, SafeCare provides a summary of the
main gaps that were identified in the facility, highlighting areas where the facility needs to
improve. The feedback is communicated to the PHC point person and the PHC’s “officer in
charge” (OIC or the “in charge” for short).
(4) Improvement Plan: In consultation with the facility’s staff and personnel from the Federal Ministry
of Health, the SafeCare consultants formulate a detailed “quality improvement plan” (QIP) for
each PHC. Appendix Table lists the standards and actions that were recommended by SafeCare.

The full scoring scale is as follows: 100 if “compliant”, 75 if “partially compliant – mild”, 65 if “partially compliant –
moderate”, 55 if “partially compliant – serious”, 45 if “partially compliant – very serious”, 35 if “non compliant – mild”,
25 if “not compliant – moderate”, 15 if “not compliant – serious”, 5 if “not compliant – very serious” (SafeCare 2014).

(5) Implementation Assistance and Feedback: SafeCare personnel provide both remote and in-person
assistance and feedback to the PHC staff towards the implementation of the plan. The in-person
visits by SafeCare personnel occur every other week for nine months from the introduction of the
plan. A staff member of the FMOH also accompanies SafeCare personnel; the staff visited each
facility once a week to monitor progress and assist the PHC’s staff in the implementation of the
improvement plan.

3. Experimental Design
3.1 Experimental design
To evaluate the program’s effects, the assignment of PHCs to the treatment was randomized, and
independent data collection took place.6 The randomized controlled trial involved a total of 80 PHCs,
located in 20 hospital catchment areas in 6 states. These facilities were randomly assigned to one of
the following experimental conditions:
 Treatment A: The full SafeCare program as described in Section 2, including the general 2day training session, the initial assessment and feedback, the quality improvement plan, and
the implementation support and monitoring for nine months.
 Treatment B: A light version of the SafeCare program, including the general 2-day training
session, the baseline assessment and initial feedback, but without improvement plan or
implementation support.
 Control: Facilities in the control group did not receive any treatment.
Poor quality of health service delivery could be due to the PHC staff’s lack of management
training, which would imply that the staff is unaware of the recommended practices (standards) to
organize a health care facility. Another possibility is that the staff is aware of how the facilities should
be managed and organized, but they lack the capacity (either skill or attention) to implement the
practices or to put in place the processes necessary for the practices to be adopted. Treatment A
provides both information about what should be done and for the implementation of the practices,
whereas Treatment B only provides facilities with information, but not with implementation support.
Therefore, comparison of the full and the light interventions allows us to identify whether the main
barriers to improving practices and quality of care are information constraints or implementation
constraints. The implementation assistance includes periodic visits to the PHCs by both SafeCare
personnel and by FMOH staff. Thus, this component of the program contains both implementation
support and monitoring. Both elements could potentially lead to better outcomes, but through different
mechanisms: the implementation support is a form of training, and the monitoring could induce the
staff at the PHC to exert additional effort to implement the plan, either because regular monitoring
visits keep attention on quality improvements, or out of a concern that failure to do so might be

penalized by the FMOH financially or with dismissal.7 To distinguish between these two channels, in
addition to collecting data during and immediately after the intervention, we collected data one year
after the end of the intervention. If any process and outcome improvements associated with Treatment
A (if any) are simply due to the periodical monitoring, then they are more likely to depreciate once
the monitoring ceases; if, however, the improvements are mainly due to the assistance component,
then we expect them to be more likely to persist over time.

3.2 Selection of states and PHCs
The FMOH selected six states for the intervention in order to achieve representation from each
of Nigeria’s 6 geopolitical zones: Niger (North Central zone), Bauchi (North East), Kebbi (North
West), Anambra (South East), Cross River (South South), and Ekiti (South West). The PHCs selected
to receive the intervention, 80 facilities in total, were all facilities included in the SURE-P subsidy
program in these states (described in section 2.1).

3.3 Baseline PHCs characteristics in participating and non-participating facilities
Although the random assignment of facilities to experimental conditions, coupled with the fact
that facilities could not opt out of the intervention, ensures the internal validity of our comparisons,
how representative are our participating facilities of primary health care facilities in Nigeria? Facility
characteristics are not available for the universe of PHCs in Nigeria; however, our baseline data do
provide us with rich data on a number of characteristics of all 474 PHCs that were included in the
nationwide subsidies program (SURE-P) described in section 2.1, 80 of which were located in the six
states that constitute our study’s sample. The comparisons presented in Table 2 reveal that on most
dimensions, the participating PHCs are similar to the remaining 394 non-participating PHCs. For
example, the average number of staff members qualified as midwives or nurses is 2.5 in participating
facilities and 2.7 in non-participating facilities; 73 percent of the participating PHCs and 74 percent of
the non-participating ones have at least one midwife per shift; participating facilities have on average
2.8 beds while non-participating facilities have 3.2 beds; the average total number of health workers
is 12.3 in participating facilities and 12.4 in non-participating facilities; 50 percent of the participating
PHCs and 58 percent of the non-participating PHCs had developed a “facility workplan” for the
current year (prior to the intervention); and both groups of facilities are located on average around 20
km from the referral hospital. Participating and non-participating facilities differ substantially, on
average, on some dimensions including the number of registered cases of antenatal care (49 versus 71
cases per month) and the number of deliveries (9 versus 30 deliveries per month), which are explained
by the presence of several larger facilities among the non-participating ones.

7

There were no formally stated or directly enforced consequences for failure to implement the quality improvements, but
attention from superiors can still induce a concern for consequences. Qualitative evidence from Zambia shows that with
regular and thorough supervision visits to health centers, health workers “feel pressured to improve performance and also
take pride in their recognized accomplishments” (Evans 2017).

9

3.4 Assignment of PHCs to treatment and control conditions
Twenty-four of the 80 PHCs were randomly assigned to Treatment A, and 24 were assigned to
Treatment B. The number of facilities assigned to Treatments A and B were constrained by FMOH
budget limitations. The remaining 32 facilities were assigned to the control condition. For the random
assignment, we stratified by state and SURE-P intervention.8 Table 3 shows the distribution of
facilities across experimental conditions by state, and Figure 1 shows a map with the 6 states and the
location of the study’s PHCs by experimental condition.

4 Data, Baseline comparisons and Estimation methods
4.1 Data sources
We use data from existing PHC-level surveys as well as data that we collected specifically for
the purposes of this study. There is no facility-level attrition, since all 48 PHCs assigned to the two
treatment groups participated in the program and were surveyed.
Baseline data: Baseline pre-intervention data stems from two sources, the Service Delivery
Indicators (SDI) from August 2013, and a World Bank data collection exercise that covered all of
Nigeria’s 500 SURE-P PHCs in September/October 2013. The SDI include data from a facilities
questionnaire with general facility information, infrastructure, and availability of equipment,
materials, drugs, and supplies.9 From the SURE-P baseline data collection, we use information on
facility characteristics and staffing details (e.g., number of doctors, nurses, and community-health
workers). The SDI and SURE-P data are used to make baseline comparisons and randomization
checks, and also as controls in some of the regressions in Section 5 below.
Follow-up data: We implemented six rounds of monthly data collection, the first about two
months since the start of the SafeCare program (June 2014), and the last one about one year after its
conclusion. This repeated data collection over the course of the intervention improves the statistical
power of our tests for actions and outcomes that are not strongly autocorrelated (McKenzie 2012). Our
data collection instrument included three parts. First, we administered a questionnaire to each “officer8

The randomization of PHCs into the two treatment groups and the control group followed these steps: (1) We assigned a
random number to each of the 80 PHCs in our population; (2) These numbers were ranked in ascending order; (3) We
ranked these numbers within each hospital cluster; (4) The PHC with the highest random number in each was assigned to
Treatment A, the second highest number was assigned to Treatment B, and the third highest number was assigned to the
control group. This created groups of 20 for each treatment arm; (5) lastly, the 20 PHCs with the fourth highest numbers
were ranked again. Then, the 4 highest numbers were allocated to Treatment A, numbers 5-8 went to Treatment B, and the
rest were assigned to the control group. Each hospital cluster was within a single state and SURE-P intervention group.
The SURE-P intervention groups included monetary incentives for midwives, non-monetary incentives for midwives, a
combination, and a control group.

The 5 modules of the SDI are: a. Facility questionnaire: General facility information, infrastructure, availability of
equipment, materials, drugs, and supplies. b. Staff roster: Part A: List of all health workers by cadre type; Part B:
Administered to 10 randomly selected health workers to measure absenteeism. c. Clinical knowledge assessment: Clinical
knowledge using 5 medical vignettes + 2 vignettes for maternal & newborn complications. d. Public expenditure module:
Collects receipts and spending (monetary and in-kind) by health facilities. e. Exit module: User satisfaction, sociodemographic characteristics & payments. The SDI data collection included 79 of the 80 clinics in this evaluation. One
clinic in Anambra was omitted in the data collection.

in-charge” of the PHC – usually the senior clinic staff member – to collect detailed information on
facility practices, staff, inputs, challenges and so on. Second, we employed a facility observation
module to check for available infrastructure and equipment, and stockouts of drugs and vaccines. More
details on these data will be provided below. Third, we conducted monthly patient exit interviews with
about three patients per PHC right after their consultation – with spatial separation from the PHC to
ensure confidentiality – to inquire about demographics (e.g., wealth, education, family size),
satisfaction with the services rendered, and perceptions about the quality of care. The data collection
was carried out by a professional survey firm independent of SafeCare or the Nigerian government.
The enumerator visits occurred on dates that were not communicated to the PHCs in advance, and the
data were collected electronically using tablets.10 Questions were read directly from the devices and
responses were recorded.

4.3 Randomization checks
Consistent with our random assignment of PHCs to experimental conditions, comparisons
between the treatment groups show balance at baseline. Formal tests shown in Table 4 indicate balance
on a number of PHC-level characteristics. With only some exceptions, differences across experimental
conditions along a number of facility-level variables tend to be small, and t-tests indicate that they are
not statistically significant. Taking into account the relatively small sample size of our treatment
groups, (NA = 24, NB = 24, C = 32), we performed permutation tests in addition to the standard t-tests
(Butar and Park 2008). Specifically, we computed Fisher’s exact tests and Wilcoxon ranksum tests
with 1,000 permutations. The results again show that the differences across experimental conditions
are in most cases not statistically significant (Table 4). This indicates that our randomization has
succeeded in creating comparable treatment and control groups.

4.4 Estimation methods
We estimate pooled-OLS and ANCOVA models with dummies for each wave of data collection:
𝑌𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑇𝐴 + 𝛽2 𝑇𝐵 + 𝛽3 𝑌0 + 𝑋𝑖 + 𝛿𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡
𝑌𝑖,𝑡 are the outcome variables (described in the next section), and 𝑇𝐴 and 𝑇𝐵 indicate whether clinic 𝑖
is in treatment group A (full treatment) or B (light treatment). 𝑌0 is the SURE-P or SDI baseline value
if available, and 𝛿𝑡 designates survey round fixed effects. 𝑋𝑖 designates the stratification dummies
including state dummies and SURE-P intervention status.

5 Outcome Variables and Results
5.1 Outcome variables
The goal of the SafeCare program was to assist the PHCs in adopting a set of organizational
practices. The full set of SafeCare standards includes more than 800 indicators. Taken together, these
indicators define the “standard” according to which primary health care facilities in resource-restricted
settings should be managed. In coordination with the FMOH, we have selected a subset of 75 outcome
indicators. We did so prior to the intervention, with the agreement that the research team would collect
data on these outcomes independently of the consultants or the government. Our aim was to select a
broad range of outcomes in critical managerial and organizational areas and with varying degrees of
ease of implementation. In fact, the “standards” (both the full set and the subset on which we focus)
vary in whether they are under the control of PHCs’ staff, and in the amount of effort required to
achieving them.
To organize the analysis, the selected outcomes were classified into three groups: “Within PHC
control/Low effort”, “Within PHC control/Moderate effort” and “Outside PHC control/High effort”.
The “Within PHC control/Low effort” outcomes are fully within the control of the PHC staff and
require no or minimal additional resources and effort – e.g., displaying posters in the waiting area with
hand washing guidelines, malaria symptoms, or a charter of patient rights. The “Within PHC
control/Moderate effort” outcomes can be implemented with higher and more sustained effort on the
part of staff, but still without any additional support from the local or central government – e.g.,
ensuring the presence of hand washing materials and keeping the facility clean. Finally, the “Outside
PHC control/High effort” outcomes include outcomes that require either substantial additional effort
on the part of the staff or significant infrastructure support from the government. For example, one of
the SafeCare standards prescribes that each PHC should have uninterrupted access to electricity;
however, whether any given PHC is connected to the national power grid is outside the control of local
PHC management. Of the 75 selected outcomes, 18 were classified as “Within PHC control/Low
effort”, 37 indicators were classified as “Within PHC control/Moderate effort”, and 20 were classified
as “outside PHC control/High effort”. The full list of outcomes and their classification are provided in
the appendix.
At the time when we selected and classified the outcome variables, we did not yet have access
to the Quality Improvement Plans (QIPs) that the 24 Treatment A facilities had received. When we
received access to the detailed QIPs, we matched the actions in the QIPs to the variables that we used
in our data collection. The actions in the QIPs are fairly broad in their formulation (see the examples
in Figure 2), and therefore in most cases there were multiple variables from our surveys that would
match with an individual QIP action. However, for other QIP actions, there were no variables in our
surveys that matched. In total, we matched 46 variables from our surveys to the QIP actions. The
FMOH and representatives from the PHCs involved in Treatment A determined who at the PHC was
responsible for implementing the suggested improvements. 30 QIP actions were directed at the PHC’s
officer-in-charge, 7 others were directed at the local government or the federal (SURE-P) program
12

managers, and 9 were aimed at both levels.11 Changes to be implemented by the federal or local
government would be harder (or even impossible) to change by the local staff of the PHC. When we
compare our Low/Moderate/High effort-classification with the QIP actions for the variables that could
be matched, we observe a large overlap in the classifications, as a large majority of the variables we
classified as “Within PHC control/Low effort” or “Within PHC control/Moderate effort” were indeed
marked as changes to be implemented by the PHC staff in the QIPs. Specifically, about 80% of our
“Within PHC control/Low” and ”Within PHC control/Moderate effort” variables were classified by
the FMOH as being within the control of the facility staff, and the remaining 20% was classified as
being the responsibility of both the staff and the local or federal government; and all of the outcome
variables that we classified as “Outside PHC control/High effort” were classified by the FMOH as
being outside the control of the PHCs’ staff. It is important to note that the SafeCare intervention could
in principle have effects also on “Outside PHC control/High effort” practices. In fact, the FMOH was
considerably involved in the implementation of the intervention; specifically, FMOH personnel would
visit Treatment A facilities periodically, providing monitoring and support during the implementation
of the improvement plan.
We also classified indicators according to where they reach the clinical process. Some changes
(“process” indicators) focus principally on process but only indirectly affect patient health, such as
putting up a poster with clinical information. Other changes (“intermediate outcome” indicators) may
have a more direct effect on patient health, such as the cleanliness of the facilities and the availability
of hand washing materials. Across our 75 measured indicators, we identified 61 that are focused on
process and 14 that capture intermediate outcomes. The ultimate goal of this intervention, of course,
is to actually improve health outcomes. However, as explained above, given the sample size of the
evaluation, implausibly large changes in health outcomes would be required in order to emerge as
statistically significant; as such, we focus on the adoption of practices and on intermediate outcomes.

5.2 Results
5.2.1 Summary of Results
Before presenting our results in detail, we summarize the findings (Table 5): Treatment A had a
positive and statistically significant effect on 22 of the 75 indicators that we considered, whereas
Treatment B had a statistically significant effect on only 3 indicators. When we divide the indicators
according to the difficulty of implementation as described above, we observe that the vast majority of
the statistically significant effects of Treatment A were obtained for the indicators that were classified
as being “Within PHC control/Low effort” (7 out of 18 indicators, or 39%) or “Within PHC
control/Moderate effort” (12 out of 37 indicators, or 32%), whereas the Treatment A had a statistically
significant effect on only 3 of the 20 “Outside PHC control/High effort” indicators. As for Treatment
B, we only find statistically significant differences in 8% (3 out of 37) “Within PHC control/ Moderate
effort” indicators.

11

A detailed list of QIP actions and their corresponding variables in our surveys can be found in Appendix table 3.

13

Looking at “process” versus “intermediate outcome” indicators, we observe that Treatment A
resulted in positive, significant changes in 30% of the process indicators (18 out of 61), and 29% of
the intermediate outcome indicators (4 out of 14). Treatment B, instead, resulted in significant changes
in 5% of process indicators and none of the intermediate outcome indicators.
After describing our detailed regression results below, we perform two exercises to correct for
Multiple Hypothesis Testing. First, we construct a small set of indices based on the classification of
indicators described above, which reduce greatly the number of tests being performed. Second, we
adjust the p-values on the original regressions’ coefficients to account for the fact that we are testing
a large number of hypotheses.

5.2.2 Process Indicators
Management and Leadership (Table 6A)
The SafeCare program emphasized certain aspects of facility management, including the need
for regular communications between the health center staff. In Table 6A we observe that Treatment A
clinics increased the likelihood of holding staff meetings in the previous month by 16 percentage
points, and reported holding about 0.2 additional meetings in the previous month (marginally
significant). By comparison, 67 percent of facilities in the control group reported holding a staff
meeting in the last month, and the average number of meetings held in the control facilities was slightly
above 1. Both these indicators were classified as “Within PHC control/Moderate effort.” PHCs in
Treatment A are also 15 percentage points more likely (statistically insignificant) to report that they
are “working towards quality improvement targets”. However, staff did not appear to be more likely
to make suggestions for improvement to the officer-in-charge.
Treatment A clinics displayed a 64 percentage point higher likelihood than control facilities of
posting an organizational chart on the wall (versus a rate of zero in the control group), an action
classified as “Within PHC control/Low effort,” and a 20 percentage point higher likelihood of having
a well-organized drug storage area, i.e. with drugs that are labeled and arranged by expiration date
(versus a rate of zero in the control group). The latter, an action classified as “Within PHC
control/Moderate effort,” is a practice recommended to reduce the likelihood of stock-outs of essential
drugs and vaccines. No meaningful (statistically or economically) effects were found for Treatment
B.

Patient Rights (Table 6B)
Treatment A led to a 63 percentage point increase in PHCs visibly posting a patient rights charter
in the waiting area (versus a rate of zero in the control group). However, no effect was found for
posters with clinical information, although those started from a much higher baseline of 57 percent.
Both of these processes were classified as “Within PHC control/Low effort” actions. The number of
ward screens in the facility – an action classified as “Outside PHC control/High effort” – increased for
both treatment groups; however, the estimated effect of Treatment A is twice as large as that of
Treatment B, and it is statistically significant, whereas the estimated coefficient is insignificant for
Treatment B.
14

Risk Management, Waste Management, Sterilization and Security (Table 6C)
Risk management and sterilization processes are core elements of quality of care and patient
safety. Treatment A led to a 34 percentage point increase (from a baseline of 16 percent) in the
likelihood that facilities designate an individual responsible for infection control. Also, Treatment A
facilities were 20 percentage points more likely to have guidelines on waste management, compared
to a baseline of zero (significant at the ten percent level). Both these indicators were classified as
“Within PHC control/Low effort.”
SafeCare also emphasized the separation of medical waste from ordinary waste, as medical waste
that is not properly handled and disposed of represents a high risk of infection or injury to health care
personnel, as well as a lesser risk to the general public through the spread of micro-organisms from
health care facilities into the environment (Windfield and Brooks 2015). Treatment A led to a 32
percentage point increase in the adoption of clearly marked bins for different types of waste (versus a
baseline of 32 percent in the control PHCs), and to a (marginally significant) 17 percentage point
increase in the availability of a poster showing waste separation. However, we do not detect effects on
medical and other waste actually being disposed of differently, which is a harder to change
intermediate outcome indicator (classified as “Within PHC control/Moderate effort”) than the
relatively low effort processes of putting up posters or marking waste bins. Neither treatment increased
the availability of medical gloves or sterilization equipment. We classified the availability of
professional sterilization equipment as “Outside PHC control/High effort,“ because the PHCs are
dependent on actions by government authorities to provide these tools.
Finally, SafeCare emphasized the importance of using different cleaning devices, such as mops,
for the different areas of the clinic, for example to reduce the likelihood of spreading germs from the
toilets to the waiting area. Despite this emphasis, we do not observe that the treatments increased usage
of different mops, which could have been implemented with some effort (“Within PHC
control/Moderate effort”). However, for the clinics that did use different mops, both treatments
increased the likelihood that a color-coded system was employed to differentiate the respective mops.

Facility Management Services (Table 6D)
We do not observe changes in basic facility infrastructure (e.g., whether the facility has
electricity interruptions or clean water available all year), which are of course “Outside PHC
control/High effort” actions. So access to power and water were not affected by Treatment A or
Treatment B. However, if the facility possessed a generator (which is classified as a “Outside PHC
control/High effort” process indicator), Treatment A led to a 26 percentage point increase in the
availability of fuel for the generator (a “Within PHC control/Moderate effort action with a baseline of
58% in control PHCs). Note that PHCs did not receive an additional discretionary budget, so additional
availability of fuel may imply some community organization.

15

Human Resources Management (Table 6E)
We do not observe changes in any of the indicators related to human resources management.
Because the facilities’ officers-in-charge do not have resources or authority to hire extra staff or to
reward staff performance, there are no differences between the numbers of clinic staff or human
resource practices such as performance measurement systems or reward programs. However, some
indicators that were classified as “Within PHC con troll/Low effort,” namely whether the facility had
a written list of all clinical staff and whether they had submitted a request for additional staff, were
also unaffected by the treatment.

Primary Health Care Services (Table 6F)
The program showed no impacts on intermediate outcome indicators such as the number of
antenatal care visits, the number of deliveries at the clinic or the number of deliveries with
complications. However, Treatment A facilities are significantly more likely to report Apgar scores
for newborns (“Within PHC control/Moderate effort”), an important tool, but neither treatments shows
effects on the availability of a partograph (“Within the PHC control/Low effort”).12,13 The treatments
also did not affect whether the clinics would keep individual case records (“Within PHC
control/Moderate effort”).
Critical goals of the quality improvement program were procedures that would improve hygiene
and cleanliness. Evidence from other studies demonstrates that handwashing improves health (EjemotNwadiaro et al. 2015; WHO 2009) and that the provision of handwashing materials can increase
handwashing (Kotch et al. 2007; Maury et al. 2000). We find that Treatment A increased the
availability of hand washing facilities for patients by 18 percentage points (from a baseline of 42
percent), and both Treatment A and B increased the availability of hand washing facilities for medical
personnel, although the baseline in control PHCs in this case was 84 percent. Treatment A also
increased the availability of water in the consulting room and the waiting room by 28 percent and 13
percent, respectively (from a baseline of about 30 percent in both cases). We detected no effects on
water availability in the bathrooms and the delivery room. All these indicators were classified as
“Within PHC control/Moderate effort.” Treatment A also had a large impact on the availability of a
poster describing hand-washing behavior (which was a “Within PHC control/Low effort action).

5.2.3 Intermediate Outcomes
In Table 7 we show the results of our regressions where the dependent variable measures an
intermediate outcome. We have two sets of intermediate outcomes: the cleanliness of critical areas in

12

Apgar is a quick test performed on a baby at 1 and 5 minutes after birth. The 1-minute score determines how well the
baby tolerated the birthing process. The 5-minute score tells the doctor how well the baby is doing outside the mother's
womb. The Apgar test is done by a doctor, midwife, or nurse. The health care provider examines the baby's breathing
effort, heart rate, muscle tone, reflexes, and skin color.
13
The partograph is a graphical record of the course of labor. Its use can reduce the rate of maternal mortality since
abnormal markers in the progress of labor can be identified early on (Asibong et al. 2014).

16

the facility (Table 7A), and the availability of essential drugs and vaccines (Table 7B).14 Specifically,
our enumerators took pictures and evaluated the degree of cleanliness of the waiting areas, the toilets,
and the bed linens stored at the facility. They also visited the drug storage area in each facility, took
pictures, and checked whether unexpired essential drugs and vaccines were available.
Treatment A increased the likelihood that the waiting room is reported to be “very clean” by
13.6 percentage points and the toilets to be perceived as “very clean” by 11 percentage points
(measured on a 1-5 Likert scale). Both coefficients are statistically significant at the 10 percent
confidence level. We do not detect any significant impacts for Treatment B. These outcomes were
classified as “Within PHC control/Moderate effort” outcomes. We detect a 9.8 percentage point
increase in the probability that all essential drugs are available due to Treatment A (significant at the
10 percent level), up from a baseline of 15 percent in control facilities, but we find no effect on the
availability of vaccines, although the baseline in this case was much higher (88 percent of control
PHCs had all essential vaccines available). During 85% of our visits at least one essential drug was
out of stock, whereas in 88% of our visits all essential vaccines were available.

5.2.4 Patient Experience and Satisfaction
One of the goals of the government was to increase patient satisfaction. There is evidence from
elsewhere in Africa that better clinical knowledge is associated with higher levels of patient
satisfaction (Leonard 2008; Evans & Tärneberg 2017). As shown in Table 8, we find that the
treatments had no impact on measures of patient experience and satisfaction. In part, this might reflect
the fact that the initial levels of patient satisfaction were high, hovering around the 90% mark.15 The
only significant result is that patients for clinics in treatment group A are slightly more inclined to
report that staff spent sufficient time with them.

5.3 Multiple Hypothesis Testing
Because we consider a large number of indicators that are potentially affected by the treatments,
we are concerned about the possibility of Type I errors (i.e., false positives). In fact, it is well known
that the probability of finding a statistically significant effect when the true effect is zero increases
sharply with the number of hypotheses being tested (Savin 1984). In our study, the concern is
attenuated because if our findings were purely due to Type I errors we would expect a roughly similar
proportion of positive and significant coefficients for Treatment A and Treatment B, whereas almost
all of the statistically significant effects are associated with Treatment A. Nonetheless, we perform
various corrections for “multiple hypothesis testing” (MHT) as described below.
There are two main ways to deal with MHT. The first involves aggregating the outcomes into a
smaller set of indicators, thereby reducing the number of tests being performed (see – for example –
14

Drugs defined as essential are Misoprostol, Oxytocin, Magnesium Sulfate (MG), Zinc, Chlorhexidine, Amoxycillin,
ORS, ACT, Fansidar/IPT. The essential vaccines are BCG, Penta, Polio, Measles, Yellow Fever, Hepatitis B.
15
In these same PHCs, we find not only extremely high rates of satisfaction but also evidence of “acquiescence bias,“
that patients tend to agree with interviewer statements and so satisfaction may be an artifact of positively framed
statements (e.g., do you agree or disagree with the statement, “You were satisfied with your service”) (Dunsch et al.
2017). Evidence from a larger Nigerian sample shows similarly high levels of satisfaction (Evans & Tärneberg 2017).

17

Kling et al., 2007). The second approach consists of applying a statistical correction to the p-values of
the estimated coefficients to account for the fact that multiple tests are being performed simultaneously
(Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER)-adjusted or False-Discovery Rate (FRD)-adjusted p-values; see
Anderson 2012). We follow both approaches. The first approach is useful because it allows us to
answer the question “did the intervention lead to statistically significant changes overall?”, which in
our context is a meaningful question in particular when we consider our classification of the indicators
into groups based on the ease of implementation and the process/intermediate outcome nature of the
variables, as defined above. However, the second approach allows us to look at specific process and
intermediate outcome indicators, which is important because different indicators vary in their potential
ultimate impact on health outcomes (e.g., putting up a poster with patient rights vs. providing hand
washing supplies to patients). In other words, as noted by Anderson (2012), these two approaches
make different tradeoffs, with the first method reducing the number of tests while avoiding to adjust
p-values (which reduces statistical power), and the second adjusting p-values without reducing the
number of tests being performed; using both methods balances the tradeoffs of each of them. In total,
we conduct 3 tests. Specifically, we construct indices (Kling et al., 2017; Table 9A), we utilize an
FDR-correction approach (Benjamini et al., 2006; Tabel 9B), and a FWER-correction (List et al.,
2016; Table 9C).
Indices (Table 9A): To build the indices we followed Kling et al. (2007), creating summary
indices that aggregate information over several treatment effect estimates. Panel A of Table 9 presents
the outcomes grouped in indices following our earlier classification (“Within PHC control/Low
effort”, “Within PHC control/Moderate effort”, “Outside PHC control/High effort”, and “Process vs.
Outcome”). After allocating each outcome variable to one index, we adjusted the signs so that a
positive sign would be always associated with a better outcome for all variables. Next, we demeaned
all variables and divided them by the control group’s standard deviation, which converted them into
normalized effect sizes.16 Therefore, each element of the index has mean 0 and standard deviation 1
for the control group. Lastly, we regressed the index variable on the treatment status to estimate the
effect.
We pooled the observations from each PHC into one observation each (column 1; N = 80).
Column 2 shows the number of variables that were pooled in the respective index. Columns 4 and 5
show the coefficients for Treatments A and B, measured in standard deviation units. Row 1 shows that
Treatment A had large significant effects of 1.66 standard deviation units in Treatment Group A for
the “Within PHC control/Low effort” index and 1.28 standard deviation units for the “Within PHC
control/Moderate effort” index. This corroborates our earlier findings (see section 5.2.1) as most of
the significant effects from individual outcome indicators were found for the “Within PHC
control/Low effort” and (to a lesser degree) “Within PHC control/Moderate effort” actions. There were
no significant effects for the “Outside PHC control/High effort” index. We also detected strongly
16

For the indices we use only 72 of the 75 indicators. Two indicators had no variation in the control group, and one
indicator’s coefficient is an extreme outlier (“patients’ right charter visibly displayed”) which would have distorted the
index.

18

significantly effects of Treatment A on the “Process” index (1.45 standard deviation units), which
overlaps highly with the “Within PHC control/Low effort” index. The “Outcome” index for Treatment
A is marginally significant with a 0.47 standard deviation unit increase.
FDR adjustment (Table 9B): The false discovery rate (FDR) was developed as a middle-ground
between measures that are considered too restrictive (e.g., the Bonferroni adjustment) and not
controlling for multiplicity at all (Benjamini et al., 2006). The false discovery rate (FDR) designates
the proportion of null-hypothesis rejections that are type I errors (Anderson 2012; Benjamini &
Hochberg 1995). FDR has greater power than FWER (see below), at the cost of allowing a higher rate
of type I errors. Using the two-stage step-up FDR-control procedure following Benjamini et al. (2006),
we are rejecting a total of 12 of the initially 22 rejected null-hypotheses when using naïve p-values
(Table 9B).17 6 of the 7 initially rejected null-hypotheses in the “Within PHC control/Low effort”
group, and 6 of the 12 initially rejected null-hypotheses in the “Within PHC control/Moderate effort”
group remain rejected when correcting for the FDR. The fact that a substantial portion of the
significant results for Treatment A remain significant after controlling for the FDR corroborates our
finding that Treatment A was effective at improving quality of care standards that are within the
control of the local PHC staff.
FWER adjustment (Table 9C): The family-wise error rate designates the probability that at least
one true null hypothesis is rejected (Holm, 1979). To control for the FWER (at 0.05 confidence level),
we followed a procedure developed by List et al. (2016), which asymptotically controls for the FWER
and incorporates information about the joint dependence structure of the test statistics and therefore is
more powerful than the standard procedures developed by Bonferroni (1935) and Holm (1979). When
controlling for the FWER, 11 null-hypotheses remain rejected. Due to the different methodology
utilized, these 11 do not all coincide with the 12 null hypotheses rejected using the FDR-control.18

5.4 Long-Term Effects
One year after the intervention ended, we gathered a final round of data in order to examine
whether the impacts were likely driven by improved management capacity (which would be signaled
by persistent effects) or by supervision (non-persistent effects). Only 3 of our 22 rejected nullhypotheses for Treatment A are still significant in our long-run follow up data (round 7): The visible
display of a patients’ rights charter (β = 0.571***; SE =0.098), clearly marked waste bins of different
types of waste (β = 0.308*; SE =0.111), and the availability of an organizational structure chart in the
facility (β = 0.557***; SE =0.119).19 All three of these findings could result from inaction on the part
of the staff; they simply did not take down the patients’ rights charter, for example. This underscores
We used the “krieger” Stata command described in Newson et al. (2003), originated from Benjamini et al. (2001).
With the List et al FWER-correction it is not possible to include control variables, which is why the total number of
rejected null-hypotheses using uncontrolled p-values is 29 in Table 9C, as opposed to 22 when employing control
variables (and as we reported in section 5.2.1).
19
The visible presence of hand washing supplies (β = 0.202*; SE =0.079) and clean storage of bed linens (β = 0.254*;
SE =0.106) were marginally significant in the long-run follow-up, but were not significant during rounds 1-6.

19

the notion that the driver of our effects in Treatment A, which was a composite of providing
information and support/monitoring, was likely the regular monitoring component.
The lack of sustained effects in the long-run is not due to staff turnover. In fact, 71% of the core
staff (doctors, midwives, nurses) that worked at the PHCs in round 1 were still working there through
round 7, i.e. one year after the intervention ended (see table 10). Retention rates are similar across the
three experimental conditions.

6 Conclusions
We conducted a randomized field experiment evaluating the effects of a health care management
consulting program for primary health care centers in Nigeria. To our knowledge, this is the first
randomized controlled study of the effects of management consulting on the adoption of organizational
“standards” in primary health care facilities in a developing country context. Moreover, our
experimental design allows us to distinguish between information effects, implementation support
effects, and supervision effects.
We find that providing a detailed quality improvement plan paired with continuous monitoring
and feedback increased the adoption of several standards and processes. The more intensive treatment
also led to improvements in some intermediate outcomes, namely those that were within direct control
of the PHC staff, such as cleanliness of toilets and waiting rooms and availability of hand-washing
equipment. These effects, however, essentially disappeared one year after the end of the intervention.
Alternatively, merely presenting baseline quality assessments and summary feedback were
insufficient to change health care practices.
All of the short-term effects were found for practices that were under the direct control of the PHC
staff, and that required minimal or moderate additional effort. The lack of adequate infrastructure and
support structures for PHC staff which our data reveal are contributing factors to poor quality of health
care provision. For example, many clinics do not have access to the national power grid, and stockouts of essential drugs are not always promptly replenished. Moreover, the PHC staff seem to lack
incentives to implement process improvements that require extra effort and thus are not “free”.
These findings indicate that information alone on what practices should be adopted is not
sufficient. That is, there seem to be no minimal interventions that immediately lead to the sustained
adoption of modern organizational practices. We find that improvements occur when specific
information on practices to be adopted is combined with implementation support. In particular,
periodical monitoring of the progress appears to be important for achieving sustained improvements
in contexts where the absence of external competition or managerial pay-for-performance fail to create
incentives for the adoption of organizational standards. In a context where many health care facilities
share the same challenges, a lower-cost alternative to the intervention here may involve a less intensive
baseline evaluation but more sustained monitoring.

Figure 2: Examples of action items from the Quality Improvement Plans and our
outcome variables.
QIP Example 1: Design an organizational chart or document which describes the lines of
authority and account-ability from governance and within the service. (1.1.1.2)
Our variable:
 Is an organizational structure chart available in the facility?
QIP Example 2: Ensure the availability of safety boxes and covered dustbins in all areas of
the facility for waste collection. Dustbins should have colour coded bin liners or should be
painted with the respective colour codes. (5.6.2.4.; 13.3.4.2.; 13.3.4.3.)
Our variables:
 Are there waste bins in the clinic?
 Are the waste bins covered?
 Are the waste bins for different types of waste clearly marked? (for example color
coded)

Note: We removed "Displaying patient right charter/poster" from the "Low effort" and "process" group here, as this
had an extreme high coefficient (as almost all Treatment A clinics put up a poster) and thus highly influenced the
indices. The 2 indicators “Are there posters showing waste separation in the clinic?” and “Does this facility have
any guidelines on health care waste management?” show no variation in the control group and were therefore
excluded here as well, bringing the total number of indicators used in Table 9A to 72 instead of 75.
