The Evolution of Corporate Cash
John R. Graham and Mark T. Leary
NBER Working Paper No. 23767
September 2017
JEL No. E41,G32,H32,N0
ABSTRACT
We put the recent increase in corporate cash in historic perspective by studying nearly 100 years
of average and aggregate cash holdings. Corporate cash more than doubled in the first 25 years of
our sample before returning to 1920 levels by 1970. Since then, average and aggregate patterns
diverge. To understand these patterns, we examine both time-series and cross-sectional variation
in cash policies and draw several conclusions. First, the increase in average cash ratios since 1980
is driven entirely by a shift in the cash policies of new entrants, while within-firm changes have
been negative or flat since WW II. Second, the cross-sectional relations documented on modern
data are remarkably stable back to the 1920s. Third, despite the stability of these relations, firm
characteristics explain little of the time series variation in aggregate cash holdings over the
century. Macroeconomic conditions, corporate profitability and investment, and (since 2000)
repatriation tax incentives help fill this gap.

The large increase in corporate cash balances in recent years has garnered much attention in both the
academic literature and popular press. Several explanations have been proposed to explain this apparent
shift in corporate policies. For example, Bates et al. (2009) suggest the riskiness of corporate cash flows
has increased over time; Falato et al. (2013) suggest the nature of firms’ assets has changed; Boileau and
Moyen (2016) and Azar et al. (2016) argue that the opportunity cost of holding cash has declined;
Nikolov and Whited (2014) suggest that agency conflicts stemming from low managerial stock
ownership are responsible, and Booth and Zhou (2013) and Begenau and Palazzo (2017) argue for a
change in the nature of firms going public. While these studies provide helpful insights, to fully
understand what is different about modern cash policies and what drives time-series changes in
corporate cash, one needs to put the recent trends in historical perspective. We gather corporate data
back to 1920 to provide this perspective.
There is substantial variation in cash holdings over the past century (see Figure 1). Today’s high
average cash balances were also experienced in the 1940s, sandwiched between decades when mean
cash-to-assets was less than half what it is today. In contrast, aggregate cash holdings today are similar
to their 1920’s levels, though they also increased and fell dramatically in the middle of the century. This
begs the question of whether these shifts in cash holdings are due to changing cash policies, changing
characteristics of firms or sensitivity to these characteristics, or macroeconomic conditions.
To understand these changing patterns in cash holdings, we perform separate cross-sectional and
aggregate time-series analyses, leading to several new insights: 1) The cross-sectional sensitivity of
cash holdings to firm characteristics has been relatively stable over the past 90 years. 2) Even with stable
cross-sectional sensitivities, changing sample composition led to changes in the distribution of cash
holdings; in particular, small growth (newly public Nasdaq) firms entered the sample with large cash
holdings (relative to assets or sales), increasing the equally-weighted average of cash ratios starting in
1

1980. 3) However, these recent changes in characteristics of publicly traded firms are not the primary
force behind changes in aggregate cash holdings. Contrary to the average, aggregate cash has been
relatively stable in recent decades. 4) Changes in aggregate corporate cash over the century are primarily
driven by macroeconomic variables, corporate profitability and investment, and since 2000, repatriation
taxes.
To explore in more detail these conclusions about why corporate cash holdings have fluctuated,
we start by examining cross-sectional determinants of cash holdings over the past century. The
development of financial markets over the century has arguably impacted the relative importance of
financial frictions relevant for cash policies, such as transaction costs and informational frictions. One
might expect that this would lead to a shift in the determinants of cash policies over time, which could
also drive time-series variation in cash holdings. Perhaps surprisingly, controlling for sample
composition (for example, by focusing on NYSE firms), we find that many of the cross-sectional
relations that have been identified in modern data are quite stable over the century. Ours is the first
paper to show this over an extended horizon.
When we allow changes in sample composition, in contrast, we find notable changes in both
cash sensitivities and firm characteristics since 1980. Recent increases in mean cash balances are driven
by the changing composition of publicly traded firms. In particular, post-1980 Nasdaq firms IPO with
substantial cash holdings, especially when their profits, sales, current assets, and debt access are low. By
contrast, pre-existing firms (including post-1980 entrants after their IPOs) did not increase cash until
after 2000. Thus, while many of the factors that determined cash policies in the 1920s are still relevant
today, changes in the composition of publicly traded firms has dramatically affected the cross-sectional
distribution of cash holdings in recent decades. This supports the views that the nature of a firm’s assets
is an important driver of cash policies (e.g., Falato et al., 2013), and different types of firms have gone
2

public in recent decades (Booth and Zhou, 2013; Begenau and Palazzo, 2017). We also show these
changes are not fully captured by standard proxies for firm characteristics.
We next turn to understanding time-series patterns in economy-wide cash holdings. Much of the
recent concern over high cash balances has focused on the amount of capital sitting “idle” on corporate
balance sheets. To the extent that corporate cash management decisions impact money demand and
economic growth, it is important to understand the drivers of change in aggregate cash holdings of the
corporate sector. This requires many years of data, to provide enough power to reliably estimate timeseries relations. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to examine this issue over a nearly 90-year
horizon.
We first explore whether the persistent cross-sectional firm characteristic patterns aggregate up
to explain time-series patterns in economy-wide cash holdings – and find for the most part that they do
not (see also Azar et al., 2016). While differences in cash holdings across firm types within a given
cross-section are fairly stable, the entire distributions shift over time in a way that is largely unrelated to
aggregate characteristics. As a result, firm characteristics don’t explain much of the time-series.
If not firm characteristics, what drives the observed shifts in aggregate corporate cash? We look
next to macroeconomic conditions, which may influence aggregate cash holdings by affecting the
opportunity cost of holding cash (e.g. through interest rates and inflation) or by influencing investment
opportunities and uncertainty in ways not captured by firm characteristics. We find that the cost of carry
is statistically related to cash holdings in level regressions but the significance disappears in first
different specifications, resulting in only minimal explanatory power. We find some evidence that firms
hold more cash when aggregate investment opportunities (as proxied by output-to-capital and GDP

3

growth) are greater. Adding these macro variables to the model helps explain aggregate cash
movements, but still leaves much of the time-series variation unexplained.
The factors that provide the most explanatory power for time-series changes in aggregate
corporate cash are simply contemporaneous cash flows and investment expenditures. Thus, while we
find some evidence that firms have cash targets, much of the year to year fluctuation in cash holdings
stems from accumulation of profits, and the use of those profits to fund investment. These results are
consistent with firms adhering only loosely to cash targets, or pursuing double-barrier cash policies
(Miller and Orr, 1966; Bolton, Chen and Wang, 2011).
Finally, we explore in more depth two periods of increasing aggregate cash holdings: the decade
leading up to World War II and the decade that started in 2000, the latter following several decades of
relatively constant aggregate cash. Despite a large increase in transactions volume in the late 1930s and
early 1940s, we find no evidence that this drove the increase in cash. Rather, our evidence suggests the
run-up in cash over this time was associated with increased precautionary savings demand in the pre-war
and war years. After 2000, we find a strong correlation between proxies for the tax incentive to keep
cash in overseas subsidiaries (Foley et al., 2007) and the increase in aggregate cash holdings over the
most recent 15 years. While none of firm characteristics, macro factors, or contemporaneous cash flow
and investment by themselves explain a great deal of time-series variation, the combination of these
factors captures the broad trends in aggregate corporate cash over the past century.
While there is a large literature that studies the determinants of cash holdings, we are the first to
comprehensively study how cash policies have evolved over nearly a century. For example, Bates et al.
(2009) argue that cross-sectional coefficients did not change much between the 1980s and 1990s. We
show that this is not just a recent phenomenon, but extends back many decades despite substantial

4

changes in financial markets over time. While Bates et al. attribute the recent cash run-up to changing
firm characteristics, we show that this is not due to changes in cash and characteristics within firms but
rather is driven purely by changing sample composition. We show that within-firm changes in cash have
been negative since World War II.
Booth and Zhou (2013) and contemporaneous work by Begenau and Palazzo (2017) study
modern data and, like us, argue that the modern run-up in cash is related to the type of firms going
public. We broaden our understanding of this finding in several ways. First, we use our expanded crosssection to show that this is only a recent phenomenon. For at least 60 years prior to 1980, non-NYSE
and NYSE firms had similar cash ratios, as did new entrants and existing firms, small and large firms,
and firms in tech and non-tech sectors. Thus, it is not the addition of more small firms or new entrants
per se, but rather the changing nature of these new entrants that has impacted the distribution of cash
ratios. Second, we show that a shift in the relative sensitivities to firm characteristics accompanies the
increase in cash levels. Thus, the higher cash holdings among IPO firms post-1980 reflects not only a
difference in firm characteristics, but differences in how these firms manage their cash policies.
Opler et al. (1999) and Azar et al. (2016) also document decreasing cash ratios since 1950. We
confirm this after correcting for the back-fill bias in Compustat and also show that this was a reversal of
an equally large increase in cash holdings from 1920 through WWII. Azar et al. (2016), Curtis et al.
(2017), and Boileau and Moyen (2016) show evidence that the time-series of corporate cash is related to
the cost of carry. Using a longer time series, we show that while cost of carry is statistically related to
aggregate cash in levels, the relation is insignificant in first differences and cost of carry has little
explanatory power for aggregate cash over the whole century.

5

The longer perspective we take has several advantages. First, we are able to describe how cash
policies of today are similar to, and depart from, those in the past. This provides a deeper understanding
of the nature of the modern cash “puzzle.” Second, having nearly a century of data uniquely positions us
to study the determinants of changes in aggregate corporate cash holdings through time. We document
an important contrast: firm characteristics are robustly related to cross-sectional differences in cash
holdings, but have little explanatory power for aggregate cash. Macroeconomic conditions and
contemporaneous cash flow and investment capture much of this time-series variation. These findings
highlight the importance of business cycle fluctuations on money supply and corporate asset allocation.
Finally, we provide a rich set of empirical facts to guide development of cash theories. For example, our
evidence suggests the frictions relevant for determining cash targets, at least among NYSE firms, are
similar throughout the century. At the same time, our evidence suggests firms are unconcerned about
modest deviations from cash targets. Dynamic theories of cash should allow for this passive behavior in
the short run. Lastly, explanations for the increase in average cash in recent decades should be consistent
with declining within-firm cash balances and increasing cash ratios among new, primarily Nasdaq firms
in the tech and health sectors.
The next two sections describe our data sources and extensively describe cash holdings since 1920.
These sections identify dominant patterns that cash research should try to explain. Section 3 explores
firm-specific, cross-sectional cash policies; Section 4 investigates aggregate cash. Section 5 concludes
and offers some thoughts for future research.
1. Sample selection and summary statistics
To form our sample, we begin with all firms in the Center for Research in Security Prices
(CRSP) monthly stock files. This includes New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) firms since December

6

1925, firms listed on the American Stock Exchange (Amex) since 1962, and firms listed on Nasdaq
since 1972. For these firms, stock market data are from CRSP. Accounting data are obtained from two
sources: Standard and Poor’s (S&P) Compustat, and, for CRSP firms not on Compustat, data handcollected from Moody’s Industrial Manuals.2 The end result is an unbalanced firm-year panel beginning
in 1920 and ending in 2014.3 In a few cases, we replace missing Compustat data with Moody’s data. In
the analyses below, we refer to this sample as the “CRSP sample.”
Because of differing institutional environments, we exclude regulated (utilities, railroads, and
telecommunications) and financial firms and focus our attention on unregulated industrial firms (all
other industries). These exclusions allow us to avoid the effects of industry-specific regulatory
environments affecting our analyses, and of course align us with the vast majority of empirical corporate
finance research. Our sample includes years affected by WWII (1940s). In Appendix B we show that
part of the increase in the mid-1940s cash holdings consists of war bond holdings (Treasury securities).
As we describe in the appendix, filtering out the effect of war bonds, or altogether excluding Treasuries
from the definition of cash, does not affect our main results.
Once per decade (in years ending in “8”), we also gather company-specific stock market and
financial statement data for every public, unregulated nonfinancial firm covered in the Moody’s
Industrial Manual. This “extended sample” includes data from regional exchanges, which to some extent
played the role of Amex and Nasdaq in the early part of the 20th century. These data allow us to
examine very small firms throughout the century and, as shown in Appendix C, allow for relatively
All firm-specific data before 1950 are from Moody’s. In the 1950s, Compustat suffers from a back-fill problem (Opler et
al., 1999), namely that Compustat initially started with a list of public companies that existed in the early 1960s, and data
from the 1950s were back-filled for these firms. We address this issue by collecting data from Moody’s for CRSP firms that
existed in the 1950s that are excluded by Compustat. Our data entry process also adds data to supplement the Compustat
sample in the 1960s and later, though the number of added observations gradually declines.
3
For all firms in CRSP as of December 1925, we gather data for 1920-1924 and include these years in some of the graphs
that follow. However, due to lack of market value data and potential back-fill bias, we exclude these observations from our
regression analyses.

homogenous across-decade comparisons with respect to firm size. In addition, we gather data from
Statistics of Income (SOI), which reports aggregated domestic tax return data for US-domiciled firms,
including private and regulated companies.
Table 1 presents summary statistics for the main CRSP sample (unregulated, non-financial CRSP
firms).4 Panel A presents statistics for the firm-year panel. Panel B presents average firm characteristics
by decade for the main (CRSP) sample, and Panel C does the same for the extended sample. In addition
to their descriptive value, these results provide a context for subsequent analyses.

2. Trends in cash holdings
Panel A of Figure 1 presents the aggregate (dashed line) and average (solid line) cash-to-assets ratios
from 1920 to 2014. The rise in average cash that started around 1980 and has garnered much recent
attention is evident in the figure, as are several other important trends. First, average cash holdings were
as high in the 1940s as they are in modern times – about 25% of assets (see also Graham, Leary, and
Roberts, 2015). Average cash ratios increased by as much from 1920 to the mid-1940s as they have in
recent decades, and fell by a similar magnitude in the two decades after WWII. In this sense, the recent
experience is not unique by historical standards.
Second, the recent growth in aggregate cash is much less pronounced than in the average, indicating
that the recent growth in the average is driven by large cash balances (relative to book assets) in small
firms (see also Bates et al., 2009). The increase in average cash holdings peaked in 2000, while larger
firms accumulated moderately more cash but not starting until about 2000. In contrast to these differing
recent trends, aggregate and average cash holdings were very similar (both in level and trend) prior to

4

See Appendix A for variable definitions.

1980. This implies that while the magnitude of the change in cash holdings seen in recent years is not
unprecedented, the nature of modern cash trends is somewhat different.
Panels B and C explore the extent to which the trends documented in Panel A are influenced by the
changing composition of the CRSP universe, which included only NYSE firms prior to 1962 but added
Amex firms in 1962 and Nasdaq firms in 1972. Panel B shows similar trends using our extended onceper-decade sample, which adds to the CRSP sample many small non-NYSE firms (note: the extended
sample shows a more modest increase in cash in the 1940s because by jumping from 1938 to 1948, the
extended sample misses the early-to-mid 1940s). In Panel C we control for sample composition by
including only those firms with at least 80 years of data. The average and aggregate cash ratios in this
constant-firm sample show a very similar pattern to the aggregate ratio from Panel A. While there is
substantial variation in the average cash ratio over the first fifty years of our sample, cash holdings for
these long-lived firms have been stable since 1970, again with a slight increase only after 2000. In the
Appendix D, we present time series plots of cash-to-assets for each of the 66 long-lived firms in Panel
C. The implications from Panel C also apply to many of the individual long-lived firms: There is
substantial with-firm variation in cash holdings, especially in the first half of the sample. The cash ratios
of the majority of the long-lived firms approach historic lows in the late-1990s, and post-2000 increases
return cash ratios to near their long-term averages. Overall, Figure 1 highlights substantial variation in
cash that is fairly homogeneous up to 1980, with significant divergence across firm types since.
Figure 2 highlights the broadening of the cross-sectional distribution of cash holdings in recent
decades. Panel A plots the cross-sectional standard deviation of the cash/assets ratio by year. The
standard deviation was fairly stable at about 10% for the first sixty years of our sample period, but more
than doubled between 1980 and 2000. In Panel B we observe a very similar pattern for the extended
sample. Thus, the Panel A jump is not merely an artifact of the expansion of the CRSP universe to
9

include Amex and Nasdaq firms, which occurred in 1962 and 1972, respectively, but rather due to
changes in the distribution of cash policies starting around 1980. This is also reflected in Panel C, which
plots the quartile breakpoints of the distribution of cash ratios each year. While earlier time-series
changes represent “parallel” shifts in the entire distribution, since 1980 there is a dramatic widening of
the distribution of cash holdings. Panel D shows that this widening is also associated with a growing
frequency of very high cash ratios in excess of 80 percent of book assets.
In sum, there appear to be four eras in cash holdings over the past century. Cash-to-assets 1)
increased dramatically from the 1920s until the mid-1940s, then 2) gradually declined through 1970. 3)
From 1980 to 2000, average cash holdings increased dramatically but aggregate cash was flat. Finally,
4) average cash plateaued starting in about 2000 while aggregate cash increased between 2000 and 2010.
2.1 Cross-sectional heterogeneity in cash trends
We now explore how the cross-section of cash holdings has evolved for firms of differing
characteristics, such as size, stock exchange, industry, and IPO status. The contrast between average and
aggregate cash ratios in Figure 1 suggests that the post-1980 increase in average cash is concentrated
among small firms. We first investigate whether this is due to the sample being composed of
proportionally more small firms that enter the sample with high cash balances or whether small firms
begin to hold more cash within-firm. To the extent that the change in average cash reflects changing
sample composition (which our results below support), we also ask whether it is firm size per se that
matters, or whether there is something else about the nature of new entrants that is different. That is, is it
the case that small firms typically hold much more cash than large firms so adding many small firms to
the modern sample naturally raises average cash holdings? Or are the new small firms of today different
from the small firms of earlier decades?

10

To study this issue, we turn to the extended sample, which contains one observation per decade
for every firm covered by the Moody’s manuals and therefore includes many small, regional stock
exchange firms. Appendix C shows that in the extended sample the average size of firms in the low end
of the size distribution is fairly stable (in real dollar terms) over the century, and hence across-decade
extended sample comparisons roughly hold size constant. Panel A of Figure 3 provides evidence that
small firms held approximately the same amount of cash as large firms until about 1980, but after 1980
small firms began to hold much more cash. Therefore, the modern surge in average cash is due to the
typical modern small firm holding more cash relative to assets than small firms did before 1980.
Panel B of Figure 3 presents trends in cash holdings by stock exchange, again using the extended
sample. Interestingly, NYSE firms had higher average cash ratios than non-NYSE firms in the preWWII period and about the same amount after the war through the 1970s. The rapid increase in average
cash since 1980, in contrast, is clearly attributable to non-NYSE (primarily Nasdaq) firms, with NYSE
firms not exhibiting a rise until after 2000.
Panel C examines variation across industries, grouping tech and health care versus all other
sectors, as defined by the Fama-French 12-industry categorization. Due to missing industry
classification for many of our extended sample firms, this panel presents the CRSP sample. We see very
similar levels and trends between health/tech and other sectors prior to 1980. In contrast, average cashto-assets among health/tech firms (which in this panel combines both Nasdaq and NYSE firms)
increases dramatically after 1980. Non-NYSE firms in sectors other than health and tech show a
moderate increase after 1980 but it is concentrated after 2000. Non-health/tech NYSE average cash
holdings do not increase until after 2000, and then relatively modestly.

11

Finally, while we have just shown that there is significant heterogeneity across unregulated
industries, Panel D shows similar cash trends between regulated and unregulated sectors. 5 However,
regulated firms hold substantially lower cash balances than unregulated firms throughout the century,
consistent with a precautionary motive for cash holdings, as regulated firms like utilities likely face less
uncertainty in their access to capital and more stable cash flows.
Figure 4 examines how cash policies differ between incumbent firms and new entrants to the
sample. The solid line displays the average cash/assets ratio in each year t for all firms in the database
(same solid line as in Figure 1). The long-dash line plots the average cash ratio for firms that entered the
sample prior to 1980, while the short-dashed and dotted lines show the average cash/assets of NYSE and
Nasdaq firms new to the sample in each year t. Between 1925 and 1980, new firms came into the sample
with cash balances similar to existing firms, with the exception of the 1930s, when new firms had
somewhat higher average cash balances. New NYSE and pre-1980-entrant firms continue to have
similar cash balances between 1980 and 2008 – and there is little if any trend in average cash holdings in
either group through 2000. By contrast, newly public6 Nasdaq firms have dramatically higher average
cash ratios than existing firms in the modern period.7
Table 2 uses a series of simple regressions to further explore the role of changing sample
composition in cash trends. In the first four columns, we estimate panel regressions of cash-to-assets on
a time trend, separately over each of four eras discussed above: 1920 – 1945, 1946 – 1980, 1981 – 2000,

Panel D plots aggregate cash ratios using Statistics of Income data, which define cash exclusive of marketable securities.
We define new entrants based on the first year they appear in the CRSP universe, which allows a consistent definition
throughout our sample period. While this definition is likely to be somewhat broader than the set of IPO firms, we find very
similar results for IPO firms in unreported analysis in which we link IPO dates from SDC’s New Issues database to our
sample from 1970 on.
7
This finding is consistent with Bates et al. (2009), who show increasing cash balances among more recent IPO cohorts. See
also McLean (2011), Bouwman and Lowry (2012), Booth and Zhou (2013) and Begenau and Palazzo (2017). While other
papers also study IPO effects, we highlight that nearly the entire 1980-2000 increase in average cash is driven by the addition
of new Nasdaq firms.

12

and 2001 – 2014. Consistent with Figure 1, the coefficients indicate a significantly positive trend over
the first and third eras and a negative trend in the second period. Interestingly, despite the focus on
increasing cash balances in recent years, the average 2000-2014 time trend in cash is negative, though
not significantly so. In columns (5) through (8) we add firm fixed effects, so the time-trend variables
measure the average within-firm changes in cash over each period. For the first two periods, the withinfirm trends are very similar in both sign and magnitude to those in columns (1) and (2). In contrast,
columns (7) and (8) show that during 1981-2000 and 2001 – 2014, the average within-firm change in
cash is significantly negative, suggesting that the increase in the level of average cash from 1980-2000 is
due entirely to firms entering the sample with higher cash to asset ratios.
In columns (9) and (10), we follow Bates et al. (2009) and remove the first 4 years of data for
each firm. The coefficients in column (9) is still negative, though smaller in magnitude (relative to
column (7)) and the coefficient for the post-2000 period turns slightly, though insignificantly, positive.
These results indicate that much of the within-firm decline in cash balances since 1980 occurs among
new firms during their first 4 years as public entities.8 Moreover, even after removing the first 4 cashburn years, within-firm cash is negative or at most indistinguishable from zero.
In sum, the information in Figure 4 and Table 2 indicates that other than IPO firms (which enter
the sample with large cash-to-assets), there has not been an upward trend in mean cash holdings in the
past few decades. Therefore, explanations for changes in cash policies in recent decades should be
consistent with negative (or at best, flat) within-firm average cash holdings since 1945. We also repeat
the analysis in Table 2 for NYSE firms only. The results (untabulated) are similar but for two
exceptions. First, adding firm effects makes little difference for the estimated time trend in the 1980 –

In light of this difference and to be consistent with prior research, in our subsequent regression analyses, we remove the first
four years of data for each firm.

2000 period; the time trend is slightly negative in both specifications. Second, NYSE firms show a
modest increase in cash after 2000, both on average and within-firm.
In Figures 5 and 6, we explore trends in cash relative to other scalers besides book assets. The
motivation is twofold. First, early theories (Baumol, 1952; Miller and Orr, 1966) envision cash holdings
as a buffer to absorb fluctuations in expenditures and receipts. As a result, the amount of cash needed is
tied to a firm’s transaction volume. In Panel A of Figure 5, we use sales revenue as a proxy for
transaction volume and examine the trends in average and aggregate cash / sales ratios. Several features
of the plot are instructive. One, while the cash / sales ratio is volatile from 1920 – 1950, there is no
overall trend. This implies that the increase in cash/assets in the 1930s and 1940s was associated with an
increase in asset productivity (sales / assets).9 (Later, in our analysis of time-series changes in aggregate
cash, in the first half of the sample we link increased cash holdings to macroeconomic productivity and
GDP growth.) Two, there was a long, downward trend in cash / sales from about 1950 to 1980,
consistent with improvements in the efficiency of cash management over this time period. Three,
average cash / sales spikes sharply after 1980, indicating high cash balances among firms with low sales,
suggesting other motives for holding cash beyond supporting corporate transactions. Panels B and C
show that the modern spike in cash/sales is entirely attributable to Nasdaq firms.
Second, the evidence in this section suggests that the broadening of the distribution of cash
holdings after 1980 relates to a break in the nature of firms going public (e.g., Fama and French (2001),
Begenau and Palazzo (2017)). One implication is that as the nature of corporate assets shifts, accounting
(book) assets may not provide the most appropriate scaling to measure cash policies. Therefore, in
Figure 6 we examine the evolution of the ratio of cash to the market value of assets, defined as equity
The lack of a 1940’s spike in cash/sales suggests that 1940s war bond holdings are not entirely ‘extra’ corporate cash held
for patriotic reasons but rather are held at least in part to support higher transaction levels. Thus, we perform our primary

market capitalization plus total book liabilities. Not surprisingly, cash-to-value spikes during the early
1930s, due to the Great Depression market crash. With the exception of that brief period, from 1926
through 1980 cash-to-value behaves very similarly to cash-to-assets. In contrast, after 1980, average
cash scaled by market value is fairly stable except for two abrupt market downturns (following the “dotcom bubble bursting” in the early 2000s and the 2008-9 financial crisis) and a modest rise in the last 15
years. Aggregate cash-to-market peaks at 21% in 1944, while over the last 50 years it remains within a
fairly narrow range of about 4% to 8%. Thus, relative to the value of assets, firms may not be holding
substantially more cash than they did 30 (or even 90) years ago. 10 Rather, financial statement book
assets may simply understate the value of these assets. Alternatively, the shift toward intangible assets
reflected in rising market values relative to book values may increase firms’ optimal cash holdings, as
suggested by Falato et al. (2013).
Summary of cash trends: Our descriptive evidence on cash holdings through the century can be briefly
summarized as follows. We explore these trends further in the sections below:
1. Average cash holdings have increased recently, but we’ve seen equally large shifts in average
cash historically, such as the run up in 1930s-40s and decline in 1950s-60s.
2. Aggregate cash has also increased recently – but much less than the average and only since
2000. Aggregate cash is about where it was in the 1920s and is much lower today than in the
1940s.
3. The cross-sectional dispersion in cash ratios was remarkably stable over the first 60 years of
our sample period, but has widened dramatically since 1980.

10

While scaling by market value may for some firms provide a useful measure of cash holdings relative to the size of the
firm, in the analysis that follows we follow the literature and scale by book assets. In unreported analysis we repeat our main
tests scaling by market values and find that doing so does not change the economic conclusions we draw.

4. In first half of century, levels and time trends in cash holdings were similar across firms of
different sizes, industries and exchanges. Since 1980, though, there have been very different
trends among small Nasdaq firms versus large NYSE firms. This increase in average cash is
a sample composition effect, not a within-firm increase in cash among small firms.
Moreover, holding size constant, the average is affected by the entry of new, cash-rich
Nasdaq firms in health and tech industries. Established NYSE firms and aggregate cash ratios
are scarcely if at all affected by these influences.
What factors underlie these changes in corporate cash holdings through time? Do the recent
changes in the level and dispersion of cash holdings represent a shift in the nature of cash policies? Or
can extant empirical models of cash holdings and changing firm characteristics account for the trends?
Do the same forces drive both average and aggregate cash holdings? We attempt to answer these and
related questions below.
3. Cross-sectional variation in cash holdings
To understand whether the trends documented in the previous section represent a change in firms’ cash
policies, we begin by exploring the evolution of the relation between cash ratios and firm characteristics
over the century. We first review the literature that relates firm characteristics to cash holdings. Then,
we investigate which of these relations are unique to the modern era and which stand the test of time.
3.1 Review of Literature Related to our Cross-Sectional Analysis
If capital markets were perfect, cash policy would be irrelevant for firm value. Investing excess
cash in liquid assets would earn zero NPV and firms could costlessly meet any cash shortfalls by raising
external finance, converting illiquid financial or real assets into cash, or reducing payout. In the presence

16

of market frictions, though, these activities are not costless. Therefore, a firm will manage cash so that
the marginal benefit of holding the last dollar of cash just equals the marginal cost.
The benefits of holding cash typically result from financing frictions. Under a transactions
motive (Keynes, 1936; Miller and Orr, 1966), firms hold sufficiently high cash balances to avoid the
costs of selling non-cash assets if faced with an unexpected mismatch between cash inflows and
outflows. This view predicts that there are economies of scale in cash management, such that larger
firms will have lower cash targets. Under a precautionary motive (Opler et al. 1999), a benefit of cash is
avoiding external finance costs when investment opportunities may unexpectedly exceed internal
resources. Under this view, cash holdings should be optimally higher for firms with more valuable
investment opportunities, lower expected cash flows, and greater uncertainty, as well as for more
financially constrained firms.
Theories point to three main costs of holding cash and liquid assets. First, lower returns are
earned on liquid assets (relative to more productive but less liquid assets) because of the ease with which
liquid assets can be converted into cash.11 Second, there may be a tax cost to holding cash, as interest
earned on liquid assets is taxed at both the corporate level (Riddick and Whited, 2009) and potentially
again at the personal level. Third, there may be an agency cost of managerial discretion (Jensen, 1986).
If managerial incentives are not aligned with those of shareholders, managers may use excess cash to
increase their private benefits at the expense of shareholder wealth. These costs lead to predictions that
cash holdings are optimally lower when the liquidity premium increases, for firms facing higher
corporate tax rates (relative to their investors’ tax rates), and for firms with weaker governance,
respectively.

11

At the extreme, (as emphasized by Azar et al., 2016) firms forgo any return if they hold some portion of their cash in noninterest bearing checking accounts.

17

Prior literature has found some degree of support for many of these theoretical predictions.
While earlier studies find mixed support for the expected negative relation between firm size and cash
ratios, Opler et al. (1999) and Bates et al. (2009) confirm this relation in modern data. Several studies
find a positive relation between cash holdings and proxies for investment opportunities and/or external
finance costs.12 On the cost side, Kim et al. (1998), Boileau and Moyen (2016) and Azar, Kagy, and
Schmalz (2016) provide evidence that cash holdings are negatively related to measures of the liquidity
premium and the cost of carry. Several studies provide evidence consistent with the agency costs of cash
holdings. Harford (1999) and Harford, Mansi and Maxwell (2008) show that firms with more antitakeover provisions hold less cash and make value-destroying acquisitions. Dittmar, Mahrt-Smith, and
Servaes (2003) find that corporate cash holdings are greater in countries with weaker investor
protections. Gao, Harford, and Li (2013) provide evidence that private firms (which are thought to be
subject to fewer agency costs) hold half as much cash as public firms, and that poorly governed public
firms quickly spend excess cash on excess investment. Nikolov and Whited (2014) use a dynamic model
to argue that cash holdings can be explained by agency costs such as managers’ private benefits from
excess perquisite consumption and attribute the recent increase in cash to insufficient managerial
shareholdings.
3.2 Determinants of cash through the century
Table 3 documents how the cross-sectional relations between cash holdings and firm characteristics
have evolved through time. We partition the CRSP sample into 10-year windows, centered on each year
ending in “8”, estimate annual regressions (within each decade window) of cash holdings on firm
characteristics, and present Fama-MacBeth mean coefficients within each decade. In Panel A, we limit

See for example Kim, Mauer and Sherman, 1998; Opler et al., 1999; Bates et al., 2009; Riddick and Whited, 2009; Falato,
Kadyrzhanova, and Sim, 2013; and Begenau and Palazzo, 2017.

the sample to NYSE firms to (broadly) isolate away from changing sample composition. Panel B
presents results using the full CRSP sample. The included independent variables largely follow the
extant literature (e.g., Opler et al., 1999; Bates et al., 2009).
Focusing first on the right-most column (the 10 years centered on 2008), we confirm many of the
relationships documented by papers that study modern data. Cash ratios are higher for smaller firms and
non-dividend payers (proxies for external financing costs), for firms with higher market-to-book ratios
(expected investment opportunities), and firms with more volatile cash flows (uncertainty about future
financing needs), which many studies interpret as being consistent with a precautionary motive to hold
cash. The negative relation with firm size and positive relation with cash flow volatility can also be
interpreted as consistent with transaction cost models. We also find evidence consistent with substitution
between cash holdings and other current assets, as well as firms holding cash to offset current liabilities.
Cash holdings are lower for firms with higher recent investment spending and (weakly) higher for
NYSE firms with higher cash flow, consistent with use of internal funds for investment and
accumulation of current cash flows. Finally, cash ratios are negatively correlated with corporate debt.
While this relation is hard to interpret theoretically, it is potentially consistent with firms with better
access to debt markets having lower precautionary motives to hold cash.
Looking across the columns in Panel A of Table 3, many of the cross-sectional relations documented
for the 2004 – 2013 column are steady through time, despite dramatic changes in capital markets and the
severity of financial frictions over the past century. While some magnitudes vary, with one exception,
each of the cross-sectional relationships just discussed retains the same sign, and is statistically
significant, in at least 7 of the 9 decades in our sample period. Many of the magnitudes are stable as
well. Overall, this suggests that many cash holdings determinants are stable across NYSE firms over the
years. The exception is that early in the century, dividend-paying firms held more cash than non-payers,
19

but less cash than non-payers since the 1960s. This dividend flip is surprising, given that the negative
relation is typically interpreted as consistent with the relevance of external finance costs for cash policy
and one would expect financing costs to be more severe when capital markets were less well developed.
We also note that the intercept increases substantially across the first three columns. This gives an initial
indication that relations to firm characteristic do not fully account for the increase in cash holdings over
this period. We return to this issue in our analysis of aggregate cash holdings in the next section.
Panel B repeats the analysis on the full CRSP sample (which adds non-NYSE CRSP firms to Panel
A). Again, the sign and significance of most cross-sectional relations are fairly stable through time
(again with the exception of the dividend payer indicator). Two differences relative to Panel A are
noteworthy. First, the relation between cash holdings and earnings becomes negative in the two most
recent decades. This suggests that among Nasdaq firms, unprofitable firms have particularly high cash
ratios. Second, the magnitude of the positive relation between cash holdings and cash flow volatility has
increased in recent years, consistent with especially high cash holdings among Nasdaq firms in volatile
industries (see Figure 3, Panel C). Finally, the coefficient on the Non-NYSE indicator shows that since
the 1980s non-NYSE (i.e., Nasdaq) firms hold more cash than NYSE firms, even controlling for firm
characteristics, and that this difference has become more pronounced in the past two decades.
3.3 Differing cash sensitivities for NYSE versus non-NYSE firms
In Section 2 we document that cash holdings evolved differently for NYSE and Nasdaq firms.
Results in the previous section suggest this may be in part due to differences in determinants of cash
policies across these groups of firms. In Table 4, we explore this implication in more depth by
estimating cross-sectional regressions similar to those in Table 3, except we allow for different
sensitivities for NYSE and non-NYSE firms. We use the extended sample in Panel A so we can study

20

how the difference in cash policies between NYSE and non-NYSE firms has evolved over the century.
Recall that the extended sample data are just for a single year (1928, 1938, etc.) in each decade, so these
are pure cross-sectional regressions. Because the extended sample lacks information on industry and
market prices, we drop volatility and market/book from this specification. Investment is also dropped
because it is not possible to calculate change in assets using the one-year-per-decade data in the
extended sample. Offsetting this, we have credit rating information for the extended sample, and Panel
A includes a variable indicating whether a firm is rated.
First, we note a dramatic shift in the intercept over time. In the 1920s and 1930s, non-NYSE listed
firms held significantly less cash than NYSE firms, controlling for firm characteristics. However, the
relative cash holdings of non-NYSE firms increased monotonically through the century, turning positive
in the 1950s and becoming economically large and statistically significant since the 1980s. These
patterns suggest that the forces that have led to substantial cash holdings by non-NYSE firms have been
building for many decades and are not fully captured by the included firm characteristics.
Second, Panel A presents evidence that the relations between firm characteristics and cash holdings
differ between NYSE and non-NYSE firms, and that these differences have become more pronounced
over time. Thus, relative to the past, cash holdings are managed differently by non-NYSE firms in the
modern era, both in the level of holdings and in sensitivities to firm characteristics. For example, in the
cross-section of NYSE firms, higher earnings are associated with higher cash holdings, though the
magnitude and significance of this relation has declined in recent decades. The relation between
earnings and cash is always smaller for non-NYSE firms, and turns negative in the 1980s. (This is most
easily seen in Figure 7, which presents a time series of estimated coefficients.) Also, for most of the
century the coefficients are very similar for NYSE and non-NYSE firm for current assets, short-termand long-term-debt, but become significantly and increasingly smaller for non-NYSE firms after the
21

1970s. This indicates that cash holdings are particularly high for unprofitable, low-current-asset Nasdaq
firms with little debt financing. Low current assets can reflect low receivables and inventory due to low
sales. Thus, elements of financial constraint appear to be associated with the high cash holdings of
Nasdaq firms.13 Notably, the effect of firm size does not vary by exchange. Thus, within both NYSE and
Nasdaq firms, the negative size coefficient is potentially consistent with both precautionary and
transaction cost motives to hold cash.
Panel B of Table 4 reports results of similar analysis of the sample of CRSP firms. Panel B largely
confirms the implications of Panel A and adds that, relative to NYSE firms, cash holdings by non-NYSE
companies are more positively related to volatility and investment opportunities (market-book), and
more negatively associated with investment spending, starting in the 1990s.
To summarize so far, a primary objective of our paper is to determine whether the substantial shifts
in cash holdings over the past century are due to changing cash policies, changing characteristics of
firms, or something beyond firm characteristics. In Section 2 we showed that the modern increase in
average cash ratios is tied to changing sample composition (namely Nasdaq firms IPOing and entering
the sample with substantial cash holdings). The regression coefficients in this section begin to highlight
which firm characteristics and policies might be associated with this increase. The evidence in Table 4
suggests that the well-known modern increase in average cash holdings is tied to specific investment and
liquidity characteristics of these non-NYSE firms. Their holding more cash in anticipation of future
investment is consistent with a precautionary motive to hold cash: high cash ratios among non-NYSE
firms are pronounced among firms with high investment opportunities (market-to-book) and limited
sources of funds (low profits, few current assets, little debt capacity). The use of cash to invest is

Begenau and Palazzo (2017) attribute increased cash holdings in part to greater growth options among recent IPO firms,
which is consistent with the positive sign on M/B in Panel B of our Table 4.
13

22

consistent with the realization of this precautionary need, though it may also have a more passive or
mechanical explanation.
This combination of changing sample composition and characteristic sensitivity offers a plausible
explanation for the 1980-2000 era increase in mean cash. However, we do not observe significant
changes in composition or sensitivities during the increase in average and aggregate cash from 1920 to
1945, the reversal through 1970, or the increase in aggregate cash since 2000. This suggests other
factors are necessary to explain the time-series variation in these other periods. We explore these
implications in the next section.
4. Time series variation in aggregate cash
In this section, we explore the substantial variation over the past century in aggregate corporate
cash holdings. This variation could be driven by several factors. The first is changing characteristics of
publicly traded firms. The previous section documented stable relations between several firm
characteristics and cash policies in the cross-section, especially for NYSE firms. This suggests that
changes over time in aggregate firm characteristics could lead to changes in optimal cash holdings and
result in shifts in aggregate corporate cash.
Second, macroeconomic conditions can affect the costs and benefits of holding cash in ways not
fully captured by firm characteristics. For example, as real interest rates or expected inflation increase,
the opportunity cost of holding cash in non-interest bearing accounts or fixed income instruments
increases. Likewise, variation in the demand for (or supply of) liquid assets may impact the returns
forgone by holding more of a firm’s assets in cash and marketable securities. Further, the precautionary
motive to hold cash may be influenced by business cycle fluctuations, which influence the value of

23

growth opportunities, and the level of uncertainty about economic conditions. Finally, variation in tax
rates over time may affect the tax cost of holding cash inside the firm.
Third, shocks to cash flow and investment opportunities can impact the time path of cash
holdings. For example, several theoretical models (Baumol, 1952; Miller and Orr, 1966; Bolton, Chen
and Wang, 2011) imply firms follow a double-barrier policy, allowing their cash ratios to vary within an
optimal range. While the costs and benefits of holding cash determine the width of the optimal range in
these models, firms may appear passive about cash management as long as cash holdings remain within
that range. That is, until the cash ratio hits an upper or lower boundary, cash balances will increase
(decrease) as current cash inflows exceed (fall short of) current investment opportunities, consistent with
the pecking order of Myers and Majluf (1984).14 In this case, much of the time series variation in cash
holdings may be driven by contemporaneous cash flow and investment realizations. These firm-specific
behaviors can affect aggregate cash holdings, for example in times of high aggregate profits.
To explore the determinants of aggregate corporate cash holdings, we estimate aggregate timeseries regressions of the form:
(1)

𝐶𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑋𝑡 + 𝛾𝑀𝑡 + 𝜀𝑡 ,

where 𝐶𝑡 is the aggregate ratio of corporate cash holdings to assets, 𝑋𝑡 is a set of aggregate firm
characteristics, and 𝑀𝑡 is a set of macroeconomic variables. We estimate equation (1) in both levels
(with the addition of a time trend control) and first differences. All explanatory variables are scaled by
their time-series standard deviation to ease comparison of economic magnitudes. Coefficient estimates
are shown in Table 5. In Figure 8 we plot the fitted and actual aggregate cash ratio based on the first

Riddick and Whited (2009) show that cash holdings can be negatively related to cash flow in a dynamic model. For
example, a positive productivity shock may lead to increased cash flows as well as more investment (the latter potentially
reducing cash holdings).
14

24

difference specification; that is, we cumulate the fitted values for changes in the aggregate cash ratio and
compare that series to the cumulated changes in the actual aggregate cash ratio.
The first and fourth columns of Table 5, along with Panel A of Figure 8, present results using
only firm characteristics as independent variables. These include aggregate versions of the same set of
variables used in Table 3, with one exception. For the time series analysis, we attempt to distinguish
between firms’ expected levels of cash flow and investment and their contemporaneous realizations.
That is, target cash holdings should be lower for firms expecting greater cash flows and higher for firms
with greater anticipated investment needs. On the other hand, as mentioned above, for firms following a
double-barrier type of cash policy, the relation between end-of-period cash holdings and the current-year
realization of earnings and investment are likely to be the opposite. We proxy for expected cash flow
and investment with a trailing 3-year moving average of each variable. We then construct an aggregate
version of each variable by calculating an asset-weighted average across firms each year.
Panel A of Figure 8 shows that very little of the large time series variation in aggregate cash
holdings can be explained by changes in aggregate firm characteristics alone. Table 5 indicates few
robust significant relations between aggregate characteristics and aggregate cash. Firm size is significant
in both levels and changes, but not of consistent sign (positive in the level specification, negative in first
differences). Market-to-book has a significant coefficient in the first difference specification, but of
opposite sign from what would be expected based on the cross-sectional results in Section 3. The only
variable in the first difference specification with a significant coefficient in the expected direction is
Current Assets. While before we showed that there are systematic differences in cash holdings across
firms with different characteristics, and that these cross-sectional relations are fairly stable over time,
this analysis indicates that little of the time series variation in aggregate cash holdings is attributable to
changes in these aggregate characteristics over time.
25

To understand what non-characteristic factors explain the large variation in aggregate cash, we
next explore the role of macroeconomic conditions. We include two variables to proxy for the
opportunity cost of holding cash: the cost of carry as defined by Azar, et al. (2016), which is essentially
the nominal 3-month T-bill rate multiplied by the fraction of corporate liquid assets held in non-interest
bearing accounts15; and the spread between rates on AAA-rated corporate debt and the 10-year Treasury
yield as a measure of the liquidity premium. In addition, we include the standard deviation of market
returns and the Economic Policy Uncertainty index of Baker et al. (2016) to capture aggregate
uncertainty. We further include two measures of aggregate investment opportunities: real GDP growth
and aggregate productivity (output to capital ratio). Finally, we include the corporate tax rate to capture
variation in the tax cost of holding cash.
Columns (2) and (6) of Table 5 suggest these macro factors help explain some of the time-series
variation in aggregate cash, although only a few coefficients are statistically significant. In the level
specification, the cost of carry is highly negatively correlated with aggregate cash, consistent with
results in Azar et al. (2016); however, in the first-difference specification (column (6)), cost of carry
becomes insignificant. Aggregate productivity and GDP growth are each positive and statistically
significant in both specifications.16 Their economic magnitudes are also reasonably large. For example,
from the levels specification (2), a one standard deviation change in aggregate productivity is associated
with a 2.44 percentage point (roughly 0.6 standard deviation) change in aggregate cash.17 This suggests
that the value of growth opportunities or the expected volume of transactions is relevant for aggregate

15

Since the fraction of liquid assets held in non-interest bearing accounts is measured using U.S. Flow of Funds data, it is not
available prior to 1945. Therefore, for years between 1925 – 45, we assume it stays at the average level of 1945-49. This
assumption is reasonable, given that the fraction is very stable and close to 1 prior to 1960 (see Azar et al., 2016).
16
In untabulated analysis, we repeat the aggregate analysis for the first and second halves of the sample separately. As
anticipated in our discussion of Figure 5, we find that aggregate cash is positively and significantly associated with real GDP
growth and productivity in the first half of the sample, but not in the second half.
17
Magnitudes are similar in the first difference specification. There, a one-standard deviation change in the first difference of
productivity corresponds to a 0.7 standard deviation change in the first difference of the aggregate cash ratio.

26

cash holdings, beyond anything captured by firm-level variables such as market-to-book and firm size.
Finally, the corporate tax rate has a significant coefficient in the level specification, but is positive in
both levels and first differences, inconsistent with a tax cost incentive. Therefore, we drop this variable
in columns (3) and (7).
Adding macro variables to Table 5 increases the adjusted r-squared by about a dozen percentage
points in levels and by about 30 points in first differences. The improved fit is also reflected in Panel B
of Figure 8. While much of the time-series variation remains unexplained in the middle of the sample,
adding macro variables to the model captures some of the increase in cash holdings in the 1940s and the
decline that follows.18
In Columns (4) and (8) of Table 5, we add contemporaneous earnings and investment to our set
of firm characteristics. The coefficients on these variables are highly statistically significant and robust
across both the level and first difference specifications. Their marginal effects are also among the largest
of any of the included variables. From the level specification, a one-standard deviation change in either
aggregate investment or earnings is associated with a 0.3 standard deviation change in aggregate cash
holdings. We also see a marked increase in the adjusted r-square in the first difference specification,
increasing from 0.36 to 0.53. This is further reflected in Panel C of Figure 8. This last panel
demonstrates that a model that incorporates all three elements – characteristic-based proxies for target
cash holdings, macroeconomic indicators, and current cash flow and investment realizations – is able to
capture much of the time series patterns in aggregate corporate cash holdings over the past century.

In unreported analysis we create a version of Figure 8, Panel B that adds cost of carry (but none of the other macro
variables) to the firm characteristics. This graph is nearly identical to that shown for just firm characteristics in Panel A.
Thus, while aggregate cash holdings are negatively correlated with cost of carry in levels, the insignificance in the first
difference specification results in minimal incremental explanatory power of the time-series.
18

27

We note that the importance of current cash flow and investment realizations suggests that a
significant portion of the time series variation in aggregate cash reflects accumulation of profits or use of
internal funds. While such behavior may appear “passive” in the short-run, it is consistent with several
theoretical models of cash policy. For example, in Miller and Orr (1966), due to transaction costs, firms
only transfer funds between illiquid assets and liquid accounts when cash balances reach either an upper
or lower boundary. In between, cash balances are allowed to evolve according to the difference between
receipts and expenditures. More recently, Bolton, Chen and Wang (2011) derive similar dynamics in a
more general model. Because of external financing costs, firms only add to cash balances by issuing
securities or reduce cash via payout when those balances cross endogenous lower or upper bounds. In
this framework, firms follow a dynamic pecking-order between internal and external funds. As a result,
much of the time series variation in cash balances will be driven by cash flows and investment
expenditures. Our results indicate that summing up this firm-level dynamic behavior helps explain timeseries variation in aggregate cash holdings.
4.1 Understanding the Pre-war Cash Increase
While the analysis above helps to identify which factors are (or are not) associated with time
series variation in aggregate cash over the past century, in this section and the next we attempt to
understand more deeply the drivers of the two episodes of increasing aggregate cash: one in the 1930s
and early 1940s and the recent increase that starts in 2000.
The transactions cost and precautionary savings models offer two potential explanations for the
increase in corporate cash holdings leading up to WWII. The transaction cost models (Baumal, 1952;
Miller and Orr, 1966) suggest the average level of cash holdings increases in the volume of receipts and
expenditures flowing through the firm. This implies a positive relation between the cash to assets ratio

28

and sales to assets, which we find to be true: sales to assets increased on average in the years leading up
to WWII, averaging roughly 90% from 1926 to 1935, then increasing to 160% by 1945.
In addition, there are reasons to believe that precautionary motives to hold cash may have
increased in the late 1930s and early 1940s. First, this period was associated with a heightened level of
uncertainty. The Economic Policy Uncertainty index of Baker et al. (2016) was less than 100 between
1925 and 1931, but subsequently rose and remained over 150 from 1932 until the end of the war. At the
same time, the booming war-time economy increased the value of investment opportunities and the
limited access to funding during the early 1930s was likely fresh on corporate managers’ minds.
To test the relevance of these two explanations for the pre-war cash increase, in Table 6 we
examine cross-sectional differences in the change in cash ratios over the 1936 – 1945 period. We first
sort firms by several proxies for the severity of financing constraints using data from 1936. If
precautionary motives were relevant, we would expect firms facing more severe constraints to increase
cash balances more rapidly. We then sort firms based on their growth in sales to assets over the 1936 to
1945 period. If growth in transaction volume was a primary driver of the increasing cash balances over
this time, we expect that those firms with larger increases in sales would see larger increases in cash.
We appeal to the prior literature for guidance on ex-ante proxies for financing constraints.
Several authors have used credit ratings (Almeida and Campello, 2007), firm size (Hadlock and Pierce,
2010) and dividend status (Fazzari et al., 1988) to proxy for financing constraints (with small firms and
non-payers assumed to be more constrained). In addition, Calomiris and Hubbard (1995) (CH) point out
that a firm’s response to the Undistributed Profits Tax (UPT) of 1936-37 reveals the firm’s assessment
of its cost of external (relative to internal) finance.

29

Beginning in 1936, but lasting only two years, firms faced a surtax on any earnings that were not
paid out to shareholders. CH argue the imposition of this tax was largely unexpected. The tax rate was
progressive, based on the fraction of earnings retained by the firm. Given that firms could avoid the tax
(or lower the tax rate) by paying out more dividends, CH argue that the marginal rate paid by each firm
indicates its willingness to pay in order to avoid having to raise an additional dollar of external finance.
We follow CH and classify firms into three groups based on the marginal UPT rate they faced in 1936.
Type A firms, considered the least constrained, had retention rates below 20% and faced marginal UPT
rates of 12% or less. Type B firms, those that retained between 20% and 40% of their earnings, faced a
17% tax rate and are considered moderately constrained. The most financially constrained are Type C
firms, which retained more than 40% of earnings, increasing their marginal UPT rate to 17% or 22%.
In the first 8 columns of Table 6, we report results of panel regressions over 1936-1945 of the
cash to asset ratio on a time trend and the time trend interacted with proxies for financing constraints.
All specifications include firm fixed effects; columns (5) through (8) add the set of firm characteristic
controls used in Table 3. Across all specifications, we find a) a positive and significant time trend and b)
a positive and significant coefficient on the interaction between the time trend and the ex-ante measure
of financing constraints. The latter result is consistent with precautionary savings demand playing a role
in the pre-war run-up in cash holdings. That is, firms for which we would expect precautionary savings
motives to be more pronounced added cash at a faster rate during this period. Comparing the magnitudes
of the coefficients on the time trend and interaction variables suggest that constrained firms added cash
35% – 73% faster than unconstrained firms19. The results also show that even relatively unconstrained
firms increased their cash balances significantly, suggesting that precautionary demand was unlikely to
be the only driver of the rise in cash.

19

From column (2), 0.507/1.45 = 0.35 and from column (4), 0.809/1.102 = 0.73.

30

In columns (9) and (10), we sort firms by the change in sales to assets over this time period. In
particular, we first calculate for each firm the difference between the average sales-to-assets ratio from
1943-45 and the average ratio from 1934-36.20 We then sort firms into tertiles based on the change in
sales-to-assets and estimate similar regressions as in the earlier columns, but now we interact the time
trend with an indicator for firms in the high sales growth group. Interestingly, we find no evidence that
firms that experienced higher sales growth increased their cash ratio more than firms with lower sales
growth. The coefficient on the interaction is negative, though insignificant. This evidence is inconsistent
with a transactions demand explanation for the pre-war cash run-up. We note that this is not an artifact
of a lack of heterogeneity in sales growth rates. In fact, from 1936 to 1945, average sales to assets was
essentially flat for firms in the lowest tertile, while for firms in the highest tertile, average sales to assets
increased from 130% in 1936 to over 250% by 1943. Yet, despite these large differences in sales
growth, these two groups showed roughly the same change in average cash ratios.
4.2 The Post-2000 Cash Increase and Repatriation taxes
Finally, we noted above that aggregate cash-to-assets does not increase substantially in the
modern era until after 2000 (Figure 1), which we explore now in more detail. Recall also that average
within-firm changes in cash are negative or at best flat (Table 2). Considering this, plus the sizeweighted nature of aggregate data, we expect that the post-2000 increase in aggregate cash is tied to an
explanation that applies to large firms.
Corporate taxes can affect cash holdings due to potential repatriation taxes paid on foreign
profits earned by U.S. multinational firms. For example, profits earned in Ireland and taxed at 12%
would in general be assessed an additional tax of 23% when they are returned to the U.S., given the 35%

Results are robust to other measures of sales growth, such as the percentage difference in total sales between 1936 and
1945 and the average annual sales growth between 1936 and 1945.

US corporate income tax rate. Rather than pay repatriation taxes, many U.S. multinationals
“permanently reinvest” these foreign profits overseas, and they can appear as cash on corporate balance
sheets. Foley, Hartzell, Titman, and Twite (2007) show cross-sectionally that U.S. firms hold more cash
in foreign affiliates for which the tax penalty to repatriating is greater. We explore whether repatriation
taxes contribute to time-series increases in cash balances that are “trapped” overseas. Given that the U.S.
corporate income tax rate has become increasingly greater than the mean tax rate for major trading
partners since about 2000 (http://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/tax-database.htm), we focus on
whether trapped cash explains the rise in aggregate cash holdings among US firms in recent decades.
Interestingly, Panel A of Figure 9 indicates that the post 2000 increase in cash in Compustat data
is much less apparent in data from US Flow of Funds. The key difference between these two data
sources is that Compustat measures worldwide cash holdings (which for multinational firms include
cash held in foreign affiliates), while the Flow of Funds balance sheet data are based on the Statistics of
Income, which is collected from US corporate tax returns (and thus more closely represent domestic
cash holdings). This suggests that the difference between the two series reflects cash held in foreign
affiliates 21. This interpretation is supported by Panel B, which plots the difference between the two
series in Panel A versus the aggregate ratio of “permanently reinvested earnings” (PRE) from Harford,
Wang and Zhang (2017).22 PRE are foreign profits that US-domiciled companies have declared will be
held permanently overseas (i.e., “trapped foreign cash”). The high correlation between the series is
consistent with a large portion of the increase in aggregate Compustat cash since 2000 being due to
trapped foreign cash.

Additionally, the Flow of Funds series includes private firms, which are excluded from the CRSP/Compustat sample.
However, this difference has little effect on the aggregate ratio due to the small relative size of the private firms.
22

US-based firms have incentive to leave foreign profits overseas when the US corporate income
tax rate is greater that the income tax rate in the foreign location. Panel C demonstrates that, starting in
about 2000 and growing ever since, the US corporate income tax rate has been greater than the tax rates
of the US’s main OECD trading partners, which correlates with the increase in foreign-held cash by
Compustat firms. This relation is seen even more sharply in Panel D, which plots the growth in foreign
cash relative to the measure of repatriation tax cost used by Foley et al. (2007) in their cross-sectional
analysis. We now explore whether including this repatriation tax variable helps explain the post-2000
increase in aggregate cash holdings.
In Table 7, we explore whether avoidance of repatriation taxes helps explain variation in
aggregate cash holdings since 1981. We first estimate panel regressions (columns 1 and 2) of the cash to
assets ratio on the firm-specific repatriation tax incentive variable along with the set of firm
characteristic and macro controls used above. 23 Consistent with results in Foley et al. (2007) and
Faulkender et al. (2017), we find that higher US taxes owed on foreign profits are associated with higher
cash holdings.
We then explore whether these repatriation incentives relate to the post-2000 increase in
aggregate cash holdings. We estimate time series regressions in which the dependent variable is either
the aggregate cash ratio (columns 5 and 6) or the difference between aggregate cash as reported in
Compustat and Flow of Funds (columns 3 and 4). The independent variables include the aggregate
repatriation tax cost variable along with aggregate firm characteristic and macro controls. Since the
availability of the tax cost variable (and indeed the incentive for and practice of leaving cash overseas) is
relatively recent, we use only 34 annual observations in this regression (1981 through 2014).

Since we are relating the flow of taxes owed on foreign profits to the stock of cash balances, we use a 3-year moving
average of the repatriation tax incentive variable.
23

33

Nonetheless, we find a significant positive relation between the repatriation tax cost and aggregate cash
holdings over this time period, even after controlling for a time trend and other determinants of cash
policy.
Combining the results in Tables 5, 6, and 7, aggregate corporate profits and investment,
precautionary motives, and macroeconomic effects (such as GDP growth and a growing tax disincentive
to repatriate foreign cash) appear to explain a large part the evolution of aggregate cash over the last
century.
5. Conclusions and directions for future research
While the near-tripling of average cash ratios since 1980 has received much attention, this is only one
aspect of the rich evolution of corporate cash policies over the last century. From 1920 to 1945 corporate
cash holdings for small and large firms tripled, and then returned to below their starting points by 1970.
More recently, cash ratios among new entrants increased sharply from 1980 to 2000, while cash
holdings among large and established firms were relatively stable until 2000. We explore these large and
(in modern times) divergent cash trends using a hand-collected database for all public, unregulated U.S.
firms.
Over our near-century of data, two important drivers of average and aggregate cash are that firms
build up cash when they realize current-period profitability and use it to fund current investment. One
explanation for this finding could be that firms follow loose, double-barrier cash policies, with cash
holdings moving within those boundaries as profits and investment change. For this to explain the large
movements in aggregate cash in the first half of the sample, either the boundaries must be extremely
wide or they shifted through time as conditions changed. Empirically modeling the dynamic trends in
the upper and lower boundaries is an interesting task for future research.
34

We also find that productivity and real GDP growth help explain the dramatic increase in cash
holdings from 1920 to 1945. The increase in cash holdings over this time period is most pronounced
among financially constrained firms, such as firms that chose to pay higher taxes on undistributed profits
during the Great Depression. Together, these findings are consistent with a precautionary motive to hold
cash affecting pre-war cash accumulation.
The decrease in cash/assets and cash/sales from 1945 to 1970 is consistent with improving
efficiency of cash management. Future research should measure cash management efficiency directly
and explore this issue. The increase in aggregate cash holdings since 2000 is consistent with the
direction and magnitude of increased holdings of cash trapped overseas due to repatriation taxes.
Most of the recent papers that study cash examine the increase in average cash holdings from
1980 to 2000. Either explicitly or implicitly (because they study cash using equally-weighted
regressions24) many results in these papers are primarily driven by increasing cash ratios among small
firms. We attribute the increase in mean cash to changes in sample composition. We find that the sign
and magnitude of the recent increase in average cash holdings is entirely consistent with a ‘Nasdaq
effect’ in which Nasdaq firms IPO’d with ever-increasing amounts of cash from 1980 to 2000. This
Nasdaq effect is stronger for unprofitable, low sales, low current asset, low debt, high growth, high
volatility, health and tech firms. We emphasize that this is not purely a firm size effect. Our extended
sample holds the proportion of small firms in the sample relatively constant, and yet we still observe a
sharp increase in average cash holdings from 1980 to 2000. Thus, the sample-composition-driven
increase in mean cash does not occur because more small firms enter the sample starting in 1980 but
rather because the non-size characteristics of Nasdaq IPO firms changed. It should be noted that these
Nasdaq firms burn through a lot of cash in their first four years of existence (see also Bates et al., 2009).
24

One exception is Azar et al. (2015) who estimate size-weighted least squares regressions.

35

Another take-away from our findings, as well as those of Booth and Zhou (2013) and Beganau
and Palazzo (2017) is that characteristic-based explanations of increased average cash holdings need to
be consistent not with individual firms increasing cash over time, but with the influence of Nasdaq firms
as we have described. For example, while we do not explicitly examine agency explanations of cash
holdings, an agency explanation of the mean increase in modern cash would need to manifest primarily
in the changing nature of Nasdaq firms, and for the most part, be consistent with negative within-firm
cash holdings. Likewise for volatility explanations, changes in working capital components, etc.
Setting aside this sample composition effect, we find that for NYSE firms the sensitivities of
firm-specific cash holdings to commonly studied variables are surprisingly stable over our near-century
of data. One of the stronger findings throughout the firm-specific analysis is that debt, especially shortterm debt, is negatively related to cash holdings. While we offer some tentative interpretations above,
we find this relation somewhat hard to interpret and look forward to future research that explores this
relation in more depth. Also noteworthy, even with the stability of firm-specific cash sensitivities, and
changes in firm characteristics over time, we do not find that changes in firm characteristics explain
time-series changes in aggregate cash holdings. One must also consider macroeconomic effects,
aggregate corporate investment and profitability, and repatriation tax incentives to explain the long-term
aggregate trends in corporate cash holdings.
Finally, we also document that regulated firms hold substantially less cash than the unregulated
firms typically studied; time-series trends are similar though tempered for regulated firms. We leave a
detailed exploration of these issues to future research.

Appendix A: Variable Definitions
Cash / Assets: Sum of cash and short-term investments, scaled by total book assets.
Cash flow: Income before extraordinary items minus expected dividends, where expected dividends is the product of
dividends per share from the previous fiscal year (adjusted for any stock splits) times the number of shares outstanding at the
end of the current fiscal year.
Industry cash flow volatility: For each firm-year, we calculate the standard deviation of Cash flow over the past 10 years. If
fewer than 10 years of lagged data are available, the standard deviation is calculated over all available years, but is set to
missing if there are fewer than three years available. We then calculate the average standard deviation across all firms in each
industry-year, where industry is defined by 3-digit SIC code.
Real Assets: The natural logarithm of total book assets in 2004 dollars.
MA / BA: The ratio of the market value of assets to the book value of total assets. Market value of assets is defined as the
product of shares outstanding and stock price as of end of fiscal year plus book value of total liabilities.
Investment: Annual change in net Property, Plant and Equipment, scaled by lagged total assets.
E[Cash flow]: The average of Cash flow (scaled by total assets each year) over years t-1 through t-3. Set to missing if fewer
than two past observations are available.
E[Investment]: The average of Investment over years t-1 through t-3. Set to missing if fewer than two past observations are
available.
Div. Payer: An indicator equal to one if common dividends exceed zero in year t.
Current Assets / A: Current assets (total) less cash and short-term investments, scaled by total book assets.
Current Liabilities / A: Current liabilities (total) less short-term debt, scaled by total book assets.
Repatriation Tax Cost: The maximum of zero and the difference between the U.S. tax burden on foreign profits and taxes
paid to foreign governments, scaled by book assets. The U.S. tax burden on foreign profits is estimated as pre-tax income
from foreign operations times the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%.
3-month T-bill rate: End of year secondary market rate on 3-month treasury bills, minus inflation. (Source: Federal Reserve)
Inflation: Percent change (December to December) in the Al Urban CPI (Source: US Bureau of Labor Statistics)
AAA-Treasury spread: Difference between the year-end Moody’s seasoned AAA bond yield and the 10-year Treasury
constant maturity yield. (Source: Federal Reserve)
sd(Mkt Return): Standard deviation of the daily value-weighted market returns. (Source: CRSP)
Real GDP growth: Annual percent change in real US Gross Domestic Product (chained 2009 $). (Source: US Bureau of
Economic Analysis)
Productivity: Nominal GDP scaled by prior year total nonresidential fixed assets. (Source: US Bureau of Economic Analysis)
Personal tax rate: Weighted average household marginal tax rate on dividends from Poterba (2004).
Corporate tax rate: Top statutory US federal corporate income tax rate.

Appendix B: World War II
This appendix discusses corporate holdings of cash and marketable securities in the years surrounding World War
II (WWII). We focus particularly on the influence of US government securities issued to fund the war on
corporate holdings of liquid assets. A large spike in the corporate cash ratio in the early 1940s is apparent in
Figure 1. The solid line in Panel A of Figure A.1 shows the ratio of corporate holdings of government securities to
total assets, taken from Statistics of Income data. The figure suggests that at least some of the spike in the cash
ratio in Figure 1 is attributable to firms holding Treasury securities issued to fund the war. Further, a comparison
with the aggregate ratio of short-term investments to assets taken from our data collected from Moody’s Manuals
(dashed line) reveals that during the war years, most of the non-cash liquid assets held by firms were Treasury
securities. This contrasts with modern data, in which firms hold very little in Treasuries.
Panel B of Figure A.1 indicates that cash holdings increased in the 1940s, above and beyond this
temporary spike in Treasury holdings. The figure displays the aggregate ratio of cash to assets (solid line) and
cash and short-term investments to assets (dashed line) from our panel data sample. 25 While we do not see as
pronounced a spike in the pure cash component during the war years (1942 – 1945), the overall pattern is similar.
That is, even excluding short-term investments, the cash ratio roughly doubles, from 5 – 6 % prior to 1935 to over
10% by the mid-1940s, before falling back to around 5% of assets by the 1960s.
Importantly, the WWII increase in corporate holdings of marketable securities does not alter the primary
conclusions of our paper. If we exclude holdings of marketable securities to the extent our data allow, there is still
a mid-1940s spike in cash holdings (though not as severe), and more importantly, the regression results and
conclusions we draw about explaining the evolution of corporate cash holdings do not change. Specifically, we
filter out the Treasury holdings associated with war bond sales by first estimating a regression of aggregate
Treasury holdings to corporate assets on defense spending scaled by GDP and a number of other control
variables. 26 For the years between 1936 and 1949, we then estimate war-related Treasury holdings as the

40

estimated coefficient on defense spending times the actual defense spending in each year. We use this estimate to
construct a “filtered” aggregate cash series by subtracting the war-related Treasury holdings from total cash and
marketable securities holdings. We re-estimate the regressions in Table 5 and Figure 8 using this filtered series
and obtain similar results to those presented.

Appendix C: Extended Sample

This appendix describes the cross-sectional distribution of firm sizes for our extended sample, which contains
data on all firms covered by the Moody’s manuals. We hand-enter these data once per decade: 1928, 1938, …
2008. Our main sample (or “CRSP sample”) comprises all non-financial, unregulated firms covered by CRSP,
which limits the sample to NYSE firms prior to 1962. By contrast, the extended sample includes many small,
regional stock exchange firms.
The first four panels in Figure A.2 plot the cumulative size (book assets) distribution in the extended
sample and our main sample of CRSP firms for the first four decades of our sample period (1928, 1938, 1948 and
1958). As the plots indicate, this extended sample greatly broadens our coverage of small firms in these years,
relative to the CRSP universe. The bottom two panels plot the 10th and 25th percentiles, respectively, of the
distribution of real book assets in each year ending in “8.” As the plots indicate, the CRSP sample has many fewer
small firm proportionally, relative to the extended sample, before the 1980s. In contrast, in the extended sample,
the size of “small” firms (in real dollar terms) is fairly consistent throughout the century.
Thus, with respect to firm size, the extended sample provides a more stable comparison across decades
than does the CRSP sample.

41

Appendix D: Long-lived Sample

Figure A.3 presents cash-assets plots for each of the 66 firms for which we have 80+ years of data.
Several patterns are notable. First, there is a good deal of variation in cash holdings within a given firm,
especially in the first half of the sample. The average firm varies its cash holdings over a range (interquartile range) of 34 (12) percent of assets before 1970, but only 21 (7) percent of assets from 1970 on.
Second, many long-lived firms follow a time-series pattern similar to the overall average displayed in
Panel C of Figure 1. As a result, cash balances for most firms were near historic lows as recently as the
late 1990s. For example, in 2000, almost 90 percent of these firms had cash ratios below their firm’s
time-series median, and over 60% had cash ratios in the bottom quartile of their historical values. This is
surprising given that most of the increase in average cash ratios (Panel A of Figure 1) that has stimulated
research on the modern run-up in cash holdings had already occurred by 2000. Cash balances tended to
rise among long-lived firms only after 2000, but not to unprecedented levels. By 2014, the median firm
had a cash ratio very close to its historical average.

42

Figure 1
Average and Aggregate Cash Ratios Through Time
The solid (dashed) line presents the annual average (aggregate) ratio of cash and short-term investments to total
assets. Aggregate cash-to-assets is deﬁned each year as the cross-sectional sum of total cash and short-term investments divided by the sum of total book assets. Panels A and C use the “CRSP sample,” which includes all ﬁrms
in the CRSP database that are also covered either in Compustat or Moody’s Industrial Manuals. Panel B uses the
“extended sample,” which includes all ﬁrms in the Moody’s Industrial Manual for years ending in “8” (e.g., 1938).
Financial ﬁrms, utilities and railroads are excluded.

Cumulative Changes in Aggregate Cash Ratio: Fitted vs. Actual
The ﬁgure is based on the CRSP sample, which includes all ﬁrms in the CRSP database that are also covered either
in Compustat or Moody’s Industrial Manuals from 1925 - 2014. Financial ﬁrms, utilities and railroads are excluded.
The solid line presents cumulative annual changes in the aggregate ratio of cash and short-term investments to total
assets. The dashed lines display cumulative predicted changes from estimating equation (1) in ﬁrst diﬀerence form.
In Panel A, the estimation includes only the ﬁrm-speciﬁc target determinants in column (5) of Table 5; in Panel B,
we add the macroeconomic variables in column (7) of Table 5. Panel C is based on column (8) of Table 5, in which
we add contemporaneous cash ﬂow and investment.

Cash Holdings and Repatriation Tax Incentives
In Panel A, the sample includes all ﬁrms in the intersection of the CRSP and Compustat databases, excluding
ﬁnancial ﬁrms, from 1985 - 2014. The Flow of Funds (FOF) data are aggregate balance sheet data for nonﬁnancial,
non-farm businesses from US Flow of Funds. Cash excludes short-term investments. Panel B plots the aggregate
ratio of permanently reinvested earnings (PRE) from Harford, Wang, and Zhang (2017) to assets versus the diﬀerence
between the two lines in Panel A. Panel C presents statutory income tax rates for the US versus OECD countries. In
Panel D, repatriation tax cost is calculated as in Foley et al. (2007) as foreign income times the US tax rate minus
taxes paid on foreign proﬁts (or zero if this diﬀerence is negative). The time series plotted is the aggregate ratio of
this estimated tax cost to total book assets.

Summary Statistics
The “CRSP sample” reported in Panels A and B covers the period 1920 - 2014 and includes all ﬁrms in the CRSP
database that are also covered either in Compustat or Moody’s Industrial Manuals. There are 176,853 ﬁrm-year
observations. Financial ﬁrms, utilities and railroads are excluded. The “Extended sample” in Panel C includes all
non-ﬁnancial unregulated ﬁrms in the Moody’s Variable Industrial Manual in each year ending in “8” (1928, 1938,
etc.). In Panel B (C), averages are calculated as the equal-weighted mean of all ﬁrm-year observations within each
decade (year). Variable deﬁnitions are provided in Appendix A.

Columns (5) - (8) include ﬁrm ﬁxed eﬀects and therefore measure average within-ﬁrm changes in cash ratios. Columns (9) and (10) measure within-ﬁrm
changes in cash excluding the ﬁrst four years after each ﬁrm’s IPO, proxied by the ﬁrst year the ﬁrm appears in our database. t−statistics are in parentheses. Statistical signiﬁcance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels is indicated by ***, **, and *, respectively. Standard errors are adjusted for clustering at the ﬁrm level.

The presented CRSP sample includes all ﬁrms in the CRSP database that are also covered either in Compustat or Moody’s Industrial Manuals. The
dependent variable is the ratio of cash and short-term investments to total assets. The ﬁrst four columns capture time trends in average cash holdings.

The dependent variable is the ratio of cash and short-term investments to total assets. Reported are the average
coeﬃcient estimates from ten cross-sectional regressions (Fama and MacBeth, 1973) over the years listed in each
column heading. Column (1) includes only eight cross-sections, from 1926 through 1933 due to data limitations.

Table 4
Cross-sectional Determinants of Cash Holdings: NYSE vs. Non-NYSE ﬁrms
Panel A uses the extended sample, which includes all ﬁrms in the Moody’s Industrial Manual for each year ending
in “8” (e.g., 1938) from 1928 through 2008 and presents coeﬃcient estimates from one cross-sectional regression
for each of these years. The sample in Panel B covers the period 1926 - 2014 and includes all ﬁrms in the CRSP
database (excluding ﬁnancial ﬁrms, utilities and railroads) that are also covered either in Compustat or Moody’s
Industrial Manuals. Panel B presents average coeﬃcient estimates from ten cross-sectional regressions (Fama and
MacBeth, 1973). The dependent variable is the ratio of cash and short-term investments to total assets. t−statistics
are in parentheses. Statistical signiﬁcance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels is indicated by ***, **, and *, respectively.

Determinants of Aggregate Cash
The sample covers the period 1926 - 2014 and includes all ﬁrms in the CRSP database that are also covered either
in Compustat or Moody’s Industrial Manuals. Financial ﬁrms, utilities and railroads are excluded. The dependent
variable is the aggregate ratio of cash and short-term investments to total assets. The model is estimated in levels
in columns (1) - (4) and in ﬁrst diﬀerences in columns (5) - (8). Newey and West(1987) standard errors, assuming
two non-zero lags are used to compute all t−statistics (in parentheses). Statistical signiﬁcance at the 1%, 5% and
10% levels is indicated by ***, **, and *, respectively.

Table 7
Aggregate Cash and Repatriation Tax Cost
The sample period is 1981 through 2014. Columns (1) and (2) present panel regressions, where the dependent variable
is the cash-to-assets ratio. Columns (3)-(6) present aggregate time-series regressions. In columns (3) and (4), the
dependent variable is the diﬀerence between the ratios of aggregate cash to assets measured using data from US Flow
of Funds versus using Compustat and is interpreted as a proxy for “trapped” foreign cash. In columns (5) and (6),
the dependent variable is the aggregate ratio of cash and short-term investments to assets from Compustat, which
includes domestic plus foreign held cash. Repat tax cost is calculated, as in Foley et al. (2007), by ﬁrst subtracting
foreign taxes paid from the product of a ﬁrm’s foreign pretax income and the U.S. corporate tax rate. Then the
maximum of this diﬀerence and zero is aggregated across all ﬁrms each year and scaled by aggregate book assets.
Earnings is income before extraordinary items. NWC is current assets, net of cash and short-term investments,
minus current liabilities. Newey-West (1987) standard errors assuming two non-zero lags are used to compute all
t-statistics (in parentheses).

Panel A plots the aggregate ratio of corporate holdings of government securities to book assets from U.S. Statistics
of Income (solid line) and the aggregate ratio of Short-term investments to assets using data collected from Moody’s
Industrial manuals (dashed line). The latter is from the CRSP sample, which includes all ﬁrms in the CRSP database
that are also covered either in Compustat or Moody’s Industrial Manuals. Financial ﬁrms, utilities and railroads
are excluded. Panel B plots the aggregate ratio of cash and short term investments to assets (dashed line) and cash
