Gravity in FX R-Squared: Understanding the Factor Structure in Exchange Rates
Hanno Lustig and Robert J. Richmond
NBER Working Paper No. 23773
September 2017
JEL No. F31,G15
ABSTRACT
We relate the risk characteristics of currencies to measures of physical, cultural, and institutional
distance. The currencies of countries which are more distant from other countries are more
exposed to systematic currency risk. This is due to a gravity effect in the factor structure of
bilateral exchange rates: When a currency appreciates against a basket of all other currencies, its
bilateral exchange rate appreciates more against the currencies of distant countries. As a result,
currencies of peripheral countries are more exposed to the systematic variation than currencies of
central countries. Trade network centrality is the best predictor of a currency’s average exposure
to systematic risk.

Exchange rates appear to be disconnected from macroeconomic quantities: macro variables cannot reliably forecast changes in spot exchange rates (Meese and Rogoff, 1983) and
exchange rates are only weakly correlated with macro variables (Backus and Smith, 1993;
Kollmann, 1995). However, exchange rates do strongly co-vary: common factors explain a
large share of the variation in bilateral exchange rates (see Verdelhan, 2015). We show that
exchange rate co-variation follows very regular patterns which are determined by measures
of physical, cultural, and institutional distance between countries. Specifically, when a currency appreciates against a basket of other currencies, it tends to appreciate more against
currencies of distant countries than currencies of close countries. Our findings show that
a large part of exchange rate movements are explained by fundamental differences between
countries, despite being disconnected from macroeconomic quantities.
We measure currency co-variation in a way that is analogous to measuring market betas
of stocks. For example, starting from US dollar exchange rates, we construct the dollar base
factor as the average appreciation of the dollar versus a basket of foreign currencies. The US
dollar base factor measures systematic variation in the US dollar — similar to the return on
the equity market. To measure individual currencies’ exposure to this systematic US dollar
variation, we regress changes in their US dollar based exchanges rates on the US dollar base
factor. We refer to these regression coefficients as base factor loadings. For example, the
Canadian dollar’s loading on the US dollar base factor is 0.5 while the New Zealand dollar’s
loading is 1.3. This tells us that when the US dollar systematically appreciates by 1% versus
a basket of currencies, on average, it appreciates by 0.5% versus the Canadian dollar and
1.3% versus the New Zealand dollar.
The cross-sectional variation in base factor loadings turns out to contain a component
that is remarkably persistent. In particular, time-invariant measures of distance between
countries are able explain 33% of the cross-sectional variation in base factor loadings for
a set of developed countries and 11% for a set of developed and emerging countries. This
is due to a gravity effect in the factor structure of bilateral exchange rates: the further a
country is from the base country, the higher its loading on that country’s base factor.
Our measures include not only physical distance, but also shared language, legal origin,
shared border, colonial linkages, and resource similarity. By construction, the average loading
for a given base currency is one. Doubling the distance between a country and the base
country increases the loading by 15% for an average country. A shared language lowers
the loading between 11 and 15%. In the case of U.S. based exchange rates, the loading on
the dollar factor decreases by 50% when the other country uses English as one of its main

2

languages. Shared border lowers the loading by another 8 to 14%, while colonial linkages
lower the loadings by up to 32%. Natural resource similarity further lowers the loadings.
Understanding what drives differences in exposure to base factors is important because
base factors explain a subtantial amount of the time series variation in bilateral exchange
rates. For the average exchange rate in our sample, the R2 in the regression of exchange
rate changes on the base factor is 47%. From the perspective of a base country investor,
the average of this R2 across foreign currencies represents the average amount of systematic
risk which they face in their bilateral exchange rates. Figure (1) plots the average R2 on a
map. Due to the gravity effect in the factor structure of bilateral exchange rates, peripheral
countries, which are distant from most other countries, have high average R2 . Conversely,
central countries have low average R2 due to being close to most other countries. Trade
network centrality — a measure of a countries overall position in the global trade network
— is the best predictor of overall exposure to systematic risk in FX markets.
Measures of distance also explain the intensity of trade and financial holdings between
countries. One of the most robust empirical findings in international trade is the gravity equation’s success in accounting for trade flows: the size of trade flows between two
countries is inversely proportional to the distance between two countries (Tinbergen, 1962).
Interestingly, we find that the gravity effect in the factor structure in exchange rates is robust
to controlling for trade intensity and financial holdings. Trade and financial holdings alone
explain only 1 to 3% of the variation in base factor loadings relative to up to 33% for the
gravity variables.
The same gravity effects that drive variation in base factor loadings may lead countries
to peg their nominal exchange rate. In particular, countries may be more likely to peg their
exchange rate to countries which are closer (Tenreyro, 2007), which would lower the base
factor loading. We confirm this finding and show that the gravity effect persists even after
controlling for pegs or removing pegs altogether.
Our findings have implications for theories of exchange rate determination. In particular,
because base factors are averages across exchange rates, they diversify away the idiosyncratic
component of individual exchange rates and isolate the common variation. As a result, the
base factor loadings measure exposure to common sources of risk which drive exchange rates.
In a complete markets model, the change in the spot exchange rate measures the difference
between the foreign and domestic state prices; spot exchange rates only need to adjust if the
foreign and domestic state prices diverge. Therefore, our findings imply that the loadings of
a country’s pricing kernel on common sources of risk must differ more for distant country

pairs than for close country pairs. This finding may help shed light on whether it is common
shocks or more trade which leads closer countries to have more correlated business cycles
(see Frankel and Rose, 1998).
Gravity models have a long history in international trade (see Anderson and van Wincoop,
2004; Costinot, 2014; Head and Mayer, 2014, for recent surveys). The elasticity of trade flows
with respect to distance is large and remarkably stable over time (Leamer and Levinsohn,
1995). Economists have long understood proximity to be a source of comparative advantage
in international trade, even though standard theories of international trade do not create a
direct role for distance (see Chaney, 2013, for a recent survey of the limited role of distance in
modern trade theory). Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000) argue that costs of international trade can
account for most of the outstanding puzzles in international trade. Recently, Eaton, Kortum,
and Neiman (2016) conduct the following experiment: they remove trade frictions in a
calibrated version of the Eaton, Kortum, Neiman, and Romalis (2016) model of international
trade. Interestingly, this experiment eliminates many of the standard international finance
puzzles, including the Backus and Smith (1993) exchange rate disconnect.
There is a large literature in international finance on common or global risk factors, mostly
focused on equities. This literature includes world arbitrage pricing theory, developed by
Adler and Dumas (1983); Solnik (1983); a world consumption-capital asset pricing model
(CAPM), Wheatley (1988); a world CAPM, Harvey (1991); world latent factor models,
Campbell and Hamao (1992); Bekaert and Hodrick (1992); Harvey, Solnik, and Zhou (2002);
world multi-loading models, Ferson and Harvey (1993); and more recently work on timevarying capital market integration by Bekaert and Harvey (1995); Bekaert, Hodrick, and
Zhang (2009). We contribute by identifying distance as the key determinant of a bilateral
exchange rate’s loadings on these global risk factors. There is an emerging literature on
exchange rates that imputes a central role to global risk factors (see Backus, Foresi, and
Telmer, 2001; Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan, 2011; Menkhoff, Sarno, Schmeling, and
Schrimpf, 2012; Hassan, 2013; Ready, Roussanov, and Ward, 2013; Richmond, 2015).
While we largely understand the determinants of stock return loadings (e.g. financial
leverage or growth options), much less is known about the determinants of currency loadings
with respect to global risk factors. Currency loadings determine a currency’s risk characteristics and returns (Lustig and Verdelhan, 2007; Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan, 2011;
Menkhoff, Sarno, Schmeling, and Schrimpf, 2012; Lettau, Maggiori, and Weber, 2014). Recently, Hassan (2013), Ready, Roussanov, and Ward (2013) and Richmond (2015) develop
theories that shed light on the origins of currency loadings. Hassan (2013) points out that

5

larger countries’ currencies will tend to appreciate in response to adverse global shocks and
hence offer a hedge. In an equilibrium model of international trade, Ready, Roussanov, and
Ward (2013) distinguish between commodity exporters and final goods producers. In their
model, the real exchange rate of commodity exporters depreciates in response to an adverse
global shock. Richmond (2015) shows how the global trade network generates common global
risk, which central countries are more exposed to. This causes central countries’ currencies
to appreciate in bad global states, which drives down their interest rates and currency risk
premia. This measure of trade network centrality turns out to be the best predictor of
average R2 from our base factor regressions.
Our findings have interesting portfolio implications. Equities and other assets of distant
countries that are most appealing to, say, a U.S. investor from a diversification perspective
will tend to impute more non-diversifiable currency risk to her portfolio. These findings may
shed additional light on the home bias puzzle in equities (see Lewis, 1999, for a survey).
There exists some empirical work on the relation between distance and relative price
variability. In a seminal paper, Engel and Rogers (1996) find that the distance between
cities in the U.S. and Canada is the main determinant of relative price variability across
cities, but they document a large U.S.-Canada border effect (see also Parsley and Wei, 2001,
for more recent evidence). Our findings attribute the covariation in relative prices in various
countries to distance between the base country and the other countries. To the best of our
knowledge, extant models do not directly address the effect of distance on real exchange
rate co-variation. Presumably, part of the distance effects could be rationalized in standard,
neo-classical models with shipping costs that increase loglinearly in distance.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section (1) describes a complete markets
model of exchange rate covariation. Section (2) documents the factor structure in bilateral
exchange rates and its relation to measures of distance. Section (3) tests the gravity model
of exchange rate co-variation. Section (4) presents a calibrated long-run risks model using
our gravity model. Section (5) checks the robustness of our findings. Section (6) concludes.

1.1

A Simple Theory of Exchange Rate Covariation
Complete Market Models of Exchange Rates

We begin by presenting simple model of exchange rate covariation, which motivates our
empirical measure. The starting point for our analysis is a class of flexible, affine models
of interest rates and exchange rates. This extends earlier work by Backus, Foresi, and
6

Telmer (2001), Hodrick and Vassalou (2002), Brennan and Xia (2006), Leippold and Wu
(2007), Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan (2011) and Sarno, Schneider, and Wagner (2012).
Specifically, we adopt a version of the model developed by Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan
(2011); Verdelhan (2015).
Single-Factor SDF Model
There are N countries, one of which we classify as the home country. All foreign country
values are denoted with ∗. There is no time variation in factor loadings in the model. The
real log SDF m∗t+1 in the foreign countries is given by:
−m∗t+1 = α + χσ ∗,2 + ξ ∗ (σ g )2 + τ ∗ σ ∗ u∗t+1 + κ∗ σ g ugt+1 ,
where u∗t+1 are local shocks and ugt+1 is a common shock that originates in the home country,
all of which are zero mean and variance 1. To give content to the notion that ug originates
in the home country, we impose that 0 ≤ κ∗ ≤ 1. To keep the analysis simple, we have
also abstracted from time-variation in the σ’s. The assumption that that the common shock
originates in the base country is only to simplify exposition. This single common shock
model is a simplified version of a richer model with K common shocks, which we present
in Section (1.1). In that model, we do not constrain where the shock originates and all
results carry through. A version of our model with heteroskedasticity nests commonly used
structural models such as the long run risks model pioneered by Colacito and Croce (2011);
Bansal and Shaliastovich (2013) in FX.
By no arbitrage, when markets are complete, the change in the log exchange rate in
foreign currency per unit of home currency is given by:
∆st+1 = mt+1 − m∗t+1
= (α∗ − α) + (ξ ∗ − ξ) (σ g )2 + (χ∗ σ ∗,2 − χσ 2 ) + (τ ∗ σ ∗ u∗t+1 − τ σut+1 ) + (κ∗ − 1)σ g ugt+1
The expected excess return on foreign currency is given by: Et [rxt+1 ] + 21 V art [∆st+1 ] =
τ σ 2 + (1 − κ∗ )σ g,2 . This model produces a factor structure in bilateral exchange rates, driven
by the common factor ugt+1 . We define the base factor for the home currency as the equalweighted average of the log changes in bilateral exchange rates:
N

∆baset+1 =

1X
∆st+1
N j=1

= (α∗ − α) + (ξ ∗ − ξ) (σ g )2 + (χ∗ σ ∗,2 − χσ 2 ) + (τ σ ∗ u∗t+1 − τ σut+1 ) + (κ∗ − 1)σ g ugt+1
7

The base factor measures the systematic variation in the home country’s currency versus all
foreign currencies. For large N , we have the following simple expression for currency i’s base
factor, which only depends on the base-country-specific shock and common shock:
lim ∆baset+1 = (α∗ − α) + (ξ ∗ − ξ) (σ g )2 + (χ∗ σ ∗,2 − χσ 2 ) − τ σut+1 + (κ∗ − 1)σ g ug,t+1

N →∞

In this model, different bilateral exchange rates will have different exposures to the base
factor generated by different values of κ∗ . The slope coefficient ϕ∗ in a projection of the
bilateral exchange rate changes, ∆s, on the base factor, ∆base, governs how much systematic
risk the bilateral exchange rate is exposed to. This coefficient is determined the SDFs’
loadings on the common shocks: all else equal, the lower it is, the higher the slope coefficient
ϕ∗ .
Proposition 1. The variance of the base factor, the covariance of the exchange rate with
the base factor, the loadings on the base factor and the R2 are given by, respectively:

The slope coefficient ϕ∗ does not depend on the idiosyncratic volatility of the SDF.
The only source of cross-sectional variation is κ∗ . The slope coefficient is monotonically
decreasing in κ∗ , hence, it is a natural measure of exposure to the common shock. A country
with average exposure has a loading of one; less (more) than average exposure translates
into a loading larger (smaller) than one.
We hypothesize that the common shock exposure, κ∗ , decreases monotonically in distance
from the foreign country, ∗, to the home country.
Assumption 1. The common shock exposure is always largest in the base country 0 < κ∗ ≤
1, and κ∗ decreases monotonically in distance from ∗ to the home country.
In the context of gravity models of trade and financial flows, this assumption is intuitive.
When countries trade more or have more bilateral financial flows, their pricing kernels will
8

be more exposed to the same common shock. Distance governs the correlation of the pricing
kernel: as the distance to ∗ declines and κ∗ increases, the covariance of the pricing kernels
at home and abroad increases.
Armed with Assumption 1, we can start to interpret these results. First, the variance
of the base factor Var (limN →∞ ∆baset+1 ) is higher in ‘peripheral’ countries that are more
distant from other countries. These are countries with larger |κ∗ − 1| is larger. |κ∗ − 1| is an
inverse measure of network centrality for the home country; ‘network closeness’ is defined as
the inverse of the average distance. An increase in the variance of the base factor in turn
increases the average R2 in the factor regressions.
Second, we interpret the loading, ϕ∗ . The only source of cross-sectional variation is
κ∗ , the exposure to the common shock. The country-specific shock does not matter for the
loadings on the base factor. Since the home country loads more than average on the common
factor, then ϕ∗ ≥ 0 is always positive since we imposed that κ∗ < 1. Given our assumptions,
ϕ∗ are bounded by:
#
"
τ 2 σ 2 − (κ∗ − 1) (σ g )2
τ 2σ2
,
.
τ 2 σ 2 + (κ∗ − 1)2 (σ g )2 τ 2 σ 2 + (κ∗ − 1)2 (σ g )2
The lower bound is attained when κ∗ = 1. This is the case of perfect risk sharing when
commodity baskets and preferences are identical. The upper bound is attained when κ∗ = 0.
This is the case of no exposure to common risks. In addition, ϕ∗ increases as κ∗ decreases,
or equivalently, as distance increases. As κ∗ drops below κ∗ , ϕ increases above one. In a
trade context, this implies that lower trade intensity goes together with higher exposures to
the base factor.
Finally, we can interpret the R2 . While the bilateral R2 is not in general monotonic in
κ∗ , it is decreasing in the average loading κ∗ . This shows that as the loading on the common
factor of the average foreign country decreases from 1, the R2 for the average foreign country
will increase. With Assumption 1, this tells us that countries which are on average distant
from other countries will on average have high R2 in our base factor regressions.
In Section (3), we test the prediction of the model that distance has a significant effect
on the currency factor structure.
Long-Run Risk Interpretation
Our factor model nests the long run risks model pioneered in FX by Colacito and Croce
(2011); Bansal and Shaliastovich (2013). We specify the consumption growth process the

9

home country and the foreign country, as:
∆ct+1 = µ + xgt + σηt+1 ,

(1)

∗
∆c∗t+1 = µ + κ∗ xgt + σ ∗ ηt+1
,

(2)

xgt+1

=

ρx xgt

+

ϕe σegt+1 ,

(3)

where (ηt , ηt∗ , egt , ) are i.i.d. mean-zero, variance-one innovations. As in Colacito and Croce
(2011), country-level consumption growth contains a common low-frequency component xgt
which originates in the home country, and impacts foreign consumption growth as well.
This specification confronts the Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-Clara (2006) puzzle: complete
market models can only reconcile the low volatility of exchange rate changes ∆s with the high
volatility of m if m and m∗ are highly correlated. Colacito and Croce (2011) impute a high
degree of correlation to the SDFs through the persistent component of consumption growth
xgt . We adopt their approach. To simplify the analysis, we abstract from a country-specific
persistent consumption growth component, because these would not affect the loadings of
bilateral exchange rates on the common base factor. In the context of this model, it is
w.l.o.g. to have a single common factor in consumption growth when studying the loadings
of exchange rates on the common factor, because only the covariation with the home country
matters.
We use the following notation: θ = (1 − α)/(1 − ρ) and ψ = 1/ρ, where α is the risk
aversion and ψ is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. β is the time discount factor.
With Epstein-Zin preferences, the log SDF in country k is a function of log consumption
changes and the log total wealth return:

Exchange rates respond to the local temporary consumption shocks in the home country, the

two cases. First, when κ∗k < κk , the factor k is relatively important for home country. We
refer to these as the home country’s ‘own factors’. In this case, the base factor loading ϕ∗
increases if the factor is less important for j (κ∗k < κk ). Second, when κ∗k > κk the factor
is less importantthe home country. In this case, the base factor loading ϕ∗ increases if the
factor is more important for the foreign country (κ∗k > κk ).

different factor loadings — more so for factors that are important for countries’ base factor
variation (κ∗k  κk ). Given Assumption 2 , the exchange rate loadings on the base factor
also increase with distance.

The Factor Structure in Exchange Rates

We now turn to empirically measuring the base factor loadings and their determinants. We
start by describing the data. Next, we document the empirical properties of the base factors
and their relation to systematic currency risk. Finally, we show how measures of distance
between countries can explain the variation in systematic currency risk.

2.1

Data Description

We obtain daily FX data from Global Financial Data (GFD) for 162 countries from January
1, 1973 until December 31, 2014. All FX data is with respect to the US dollar and is converted
to end-of-month. CPI data used to calculate real exchange rate changes is monthly from
GFD. Our main results restrict the sample to 24 developed and 23 emerging countries as
classified by MSCI in August 2015. In Section (5) we present robustness tests on the full and
developed samples. We provide additional details of the sample construction in Appendix B.
Most gravity data is available from Head, Mayer, and Ries (2010) and Mayer and Zignago
(2011). Distance is the population weighted average between large cities in each country pair
(Mayer and Zignago (2011)). Common language is 1 if a language is spoken by over 9% of
the population in both countries (Mayer and Zignago (2011)). Common legal origins is from
Porta, Lopez-de Silanes, and Shleifer (2007), linguistic similarity from Desmet, Ortuno-Ortin,
and Wacziarg (2012), and genetic distance from Spolaore and Wacziarg (2009). The data
on pegs is from Shambaugh (2004). The peg classification is based upon bilateral exchange
rate volatility being less than 2% in two consecutive years. For full sample tests, the peg
dummy is 1 if either currency was pegged to the other or both currencies were pegged to the
same currency at any point in the sample. For the 5-year rolling tests, the peg dummy is 1

13

if either currency was pegged to the other or they were pegged same currency at any point
in the prior 6 years.
Trade data is from United Nations COMTRADE and The Center for International data.
Bilateral asset holdings are from the IMF Coordinated Portfolio investment survey. GDP
data are from the World Bank’s World Development Indiactors. Finally, we construct a
measure of natural resource similarity between two countries. To do this, we obtain and
clean the list of natural resources by country from the CIA world factbook. Using the list of
natural resources, we construct vectors of dummy variables — 1 if a country has the resource,
0 otherwise. Natural resource similarity between two countries is the cosine similarity of the
vectors of resource dummy variables.

2.2

Estimation

Base factor loadings are estimated for all base currencies in the sample against all other
currencies following the procedure in Verdelhan (2015). Specifically, base factor loadings,
ϕ∗i,j , are estimated from the regression
∆si,j,t = αi,j + ϕ∗i,j ∆basei,t + ui,j,t ,

(5)

where si,j,t is the time t exchange rate in units of currency j per unit of currency i and
∆basei,t is the average appreciation of the currency i against all other currencies at time t.
Starting with US based spot rates, we convert all rates to a specific base currency i. To
avoid a mechanical relation between exchange rate changes and base factors, we calculate
a separate base factor for each currency j, which omit that currency. For example, we
P
construct the US dollar factor, ∆base$,t = N1−1 k6=j ∆s$j,t , by averaging the change in
the exchange rate across all bilateral exchange rates against the USD. When we study the
relation between the USD/GBP bilateral exchange rate, ∆s$,£,t , and the USD base factor,
we drop the USD/GBP bilateral exchange rate from the construction of the base factor.
Conditional base factor loadings, ϕ∗i,j,t , are estimated using 60 month rolling windows. The
regression must have 48 months of available data for the conditional base factor loading to
be estimated. Monthly rolling factor loadings are averaged to generate yearly observations.
The base factors are closely related to the first principal component of bilateral exchange
rate changes. To show this, we compute the first principal component of the bilateral exchange rates ∆si,j,t for each base currency i. For example, instead of the dollar base factor,
we could use the first principal component of all bilateral exchange rates against the dollar1 .
1

To compare base factors and 1st principal components, it is necessary to construct a different sample

14

Table (B3) in Section (B.4) reports the correlations of the 1st principal component and the
base factor by base currency. For most currencies, the first principal component is essentially
the base factor. The only exception is Singapore with a correlation of 0.86. As a result, we
simply proceed by analyzing the base factors.
The objective of our paper is to explain the base factor loadings, ϕ∗i,j . The base factor
loadings impact numerous important quantities in foreign exchange markets. Consider the
R2 of the regression in Equation (5):

This is a measure of the amount of systematic currency risk faced by a domestic investor
in the base country who takes long positions in foreign currency. All else equal, countries
j with a larger loading on the base factor will tend to have a higher R2 . In addition, base
countries i with more volatile base factors tend to have higher average R2 . Table (1) presents
a decomposition of exchange rate variance for each base country2 . The first column reports
the average variance of the bilateral exchange rates. The second column reports the average,
across currencies j, of the variance explained by the base factor (the numerator of Equation
(6)). The third column reports the idiosyncratic variance of the bilateral exchange rates.
The numbers in the first column are the sum of the numbers in the second and third column.
All three columns are multiplied ×100. The fourth column reports average R2 .
There is large amount of variation in the variances explained by the base factors, reported
in the first column. The average explained variance is 0.68 for developed countries and 3.37
for emerging market countries. In some countries, a high explained variance reflects the
effects of high and volatile inflation episodes — the explained variances for Brazil, Peru and
Israel are respectively 11.05, 14.71 and 2.48.
But the composition of the variances are different as well. The average R2 is 0.36 for
developed countries’ currencies, compared to an average R2 of 0.59 for emerging market
currencies. This reflects the fact that the ratio of the explained variance to exchange rate
variance is higher for the latter than the former. Figure (2) shows this relation. The first
panel plots average R-squared versus average distance to all other countries. The second
panel uses a measure of average distance which is the first principal component of bilateral
because a balanced panel is needed. For this comparison only, all observations from countries which join
the euro are dropped, except for Germany. The German exchange rate becomes the Euro starting in 1999.
Using this sample, base factors and 1st principal components are calculated for each potential base currency.

Table (B4) reports the same results for real exchange rates, computed using the ratio of the countries’
CPIs.

R-squared values, Ri,j
is the cross-sectional average R-squared for each i. For each currency j, ∆basei,t is the

sample. Gravity PC is the first principal component of bilateral distance, shared language,
shared legal origins, shared colonial origins, resource similarity, and shared border. Trade
centrality is alpha centrality of a network with bilateral trade intensity as weights as in
(Richmond, 2015). Trade centrality ranking is the time series average ranking where rankings
are normalized to the maximum number of countries in the sample. Spot rates are monthly

The Gravity Effect in the Factor Structure

In the previous section, we established that variation in base factor loadings drives important
differences in the properties of exchange rates. In this section, we show that variation in
base factor loadings can largely be understood as a function of measures of distance between
countries.

3.1

Summary Statistics

We begin by summarizing the key variables in our dataset. Table (2) reports summary
statistics for all of the variables in our main sample. There are a total of 2,070 base country/foreign country combinations. There is a lot of variation in the loadings across currencies.
The average loadings are close to one. The average standard deviation of the loadings across
countries for a given base currency is 0.33. Similarly, there is a lot of variation in the R2 .
The average R2 is 0.47 while the cross-sectional standard deviation is 0.29. The average
distance between a base currency and its counterparts is 8.62 (in logs) or 5541 km. On
average, 13% (4%) of the countries share a language (border) with the base currency. The
average resource similarity with the base currency is 0.24. 2% share the same colonizer with
the base currency. 28% of the currencies have been pegged to the base currency or have
shared a peg with the base currency to another currency at any point in the sample.
Table (B2) reports summary statistics for the rolling sample. In the rolling sample, only
12% of the currencies are pegged to or share a peg with the base currency. In the 5-year
rolling samples, the peg dummy is 1 if either currency was pegged to other or they were
pegged same currency at any point in the 6 years prior.

3.2

Understanding the variation in the loadings

To explain the variation in base factors loadings, we regress the full sample loadings, ϕ∗i,j , on
various exogenous measures of the economic distance between i and j. We include physical
distance, shared language, shared legal origin, share border, colonial link, resource similarity,
genetic distance and linguistic similarity. All of the regressions indicate that an increase in
the economic distance between i and j increases ϕ∗i,j , the sensitivity of the bilateral exchange
rate to the base factor.
The dependent variable in our model is estimated. This does not bias the estimates,
but may introduce heteroskedasticity into the residuals (Lewis and Linzer, 2005). Additional correlation in the residuals arises due to the interdependent nature of exchange rates.

Summary statistics of the factor loadings and gravity data. Factor loadings, ϕ∗i,j , are from
the regression ∆si,j,t = αi,j + ϕ∗i,j ∆basei,t + ei,j,t . For each currency j, basei,t is the average
appreciation of currency i at time t relative to all available currencies, excluding currency j.
Spot rates are monthly from January 1973 until December 2014 from Global Financial Data
for 24 developed and 23 emerging countries, as classified by MSCI.

Therefore, in all tables we report standard errors correcting for heteoroskedasticity (White,
1980), clustering on base factor or foreign country (Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller, 2011),
or clustering on country pairs (Aronow, Samii, and Assenova, 2015) — depending on the
specification. Additional details are in B.3.
Table (3) reports the results for MSCI developed and emerging countries. In this sample,
physical distance, shared language, colonial linkages and resource similarity all have robust
effects on the loading. The average loading for a given base factor is one, while the crosssectional standard deviation is 0.42 (0.23) for developed (emerging market) countries. A
one standard deviation in log distance (the equivalent of approx. 8,500 km) increases the
loading by about 0.13. This number is robust across different specifications, except the no
peg specification. Shared language lowers the loading by about 0.11. Shared border lowers
the loading by 0.13. Colonial linkages lower the loadings by up to 0.23. Resource similarity
also lowers the loadings. Legal origin, linguistic proximity, and genetic distances, do not
have a statistically significant effect on the currency loadings. This specification accounts
for 1/4 of all the variation in the loadings. Given the measurement error in these loadings,
this is a remarkably high number.

Specifications (1), (2) and (3) do not control for pegs. For completeness, specification
(4) introduces a peg dummy. The peg dummy is one if the currencies were ever pegged
to each other or the same currency at any point in the sample. Controlling explicitly for
pegs mitigates most of these ‘economic distance’ effects. This is not surprising. We have
already established in the previous section that the decision to peg is driven the same largely
determined by the same exogenous ‘economic distance’ variables. The broader claim that
economic distance determines currency covariation (with or without currency pegs) is still
valid. Note that resource similarity is no longer significant in specification (4). That is not
surprising, given that resource similarity was a major determinant of the decision to peg. If
a currency has been pegged to the base currency, or if they both have been pegged to the
same currency in our sample, this lowers the loadings by another 0.25. This effect is not
entirely mechanical: the peg dummy is one if the currencies were pegged at any point during
the sample.
Finally, specification (5) excludes all currencies that were pegged at some point in the
1973-2014 sample. This reduces the number of country pairs from 2,070 to 1,498. The
R2 drops from 23.0% to 9.5%. However, distance, language, and colonial link effects are
statistically significant at the 5% level. We will use rolling sample regressions in order to
have a more targeted control for currency pegs below.
In Table (B5), we compare the nominal loadings to the real loadings. The real loadings
are computed by running the same regression of real exchange rate changes on the real
base factor. Specifications (1) and (2) report results without a peg dummy for nominal and
real loadings respectively. Specifications (3) and (4) report the same regression with a peg
dummy. Both pairs of regressions are on matched samples. In both cases, the magnitude and
significance of the regression coefficients are similar. This is consistent with Mussa (1986)’s
observation that real exchange rates largely track nominal ones.

3.3

Marginal Propensity to Peg and Rolling Sample Estimates

Exchange rate regimes are endogenous. The decision to peg is largely governed by distance
between the countries and other measures of economic distance. To show this, Table (4)
reports the estimation results for a logit model similar to Tenreyro (2007). The dependent
variable is a peg dummy which measures whether two currencies were ever pegged to each
other or to the same currency. Because the peg dummy is symmetric and the gravity data
is symmetric, the models are only estimated on unique pairs of countries.
Distance, resource similarity, genetic distance, and common legal origins are significant

Logit models of peg dummy on gravity data. Peg dummy measures whether countries were
ever pegged to each other or to the same currency during the sample. A currency pair is
considered pegged if the bilateral exchange rate volatility is less than 2% in 2 consecutive
years (Shambaugh (2004)). The table reports marginal effects at the mean. Data is yearly
from 1973 until 2014 for the 162 countries in the Global Financial Data dataset. Standard
errors are clustered on country dyads using Aronow, Samii, and Assenova (2015). t-statistics

determinants of whether currencies are pegged. Distance reduces the likelihood of a peg.
In specification (3), a one unit increase in log distance from its mean (8.73 to 9.73 in logs
or 6,186km to 16,815km) decreases the peg probability by approximately 5%. An increase
in resource similarly from its mean of .19 to .29 increases the peg probability by 2% in
specification (3). Finally, having common legal origins increases the peg probability by 7%
in specification (2).
To control for the effect of pegs in a targeted way, we use the rolling estimates of the base
loadings. Table (5) reports the results of regressions of base factor loadings computed over
60-month rolling windows on time fixed effects and the gravity variables. The peg dummy
is now defined differently; it is one only if the currencies were pegged to each other or to the
same currency at any point in the prior 72 months. Overall, the r-squareds in the rolling
regressions are substantially lower, presumably because the loading estimates are noisier.
As before, the peg dummy in the fourth specification mitigates some of these economic
distance effects, because these same effects ultimately determine the likelihood of a peg.
Specification (4) controls for pegs while (1)-(3) do not. Overall, the size of the coefficients in
specification (4) are somewhat smaller than those in specification (3). The distance coefficient
is still around 0.14 in specification (4). The shared language effect is -0.10. The effects of
a shared border is around -0.11. The effect of a colonial linkage has decreased from -0.28
to -0.2, while the effect of resource similarity is roughly constant. A one standard deviation
increase in resource similarity reduces the loading by 0.04. Specification (5) excludes the
pegs altogether. Reassuringly, the magnitudes of these slope coefficients does not differ
significantly between specification (4) and specification (5).
Interestingly, when the shared language is English, the effects are much larger. For
example, when we only consider the USD factor, the loading decreases by 0.53 when the
other country has English as one of its major languages (see Table (B6) in the Section
(B.4)).
Finally, Table (B7) checks the results of the nominal against the real base factor loadings
in the rolling sample regressions. The samples are matched on the available of CPI data.
In the real specifications (1)-(3), some of the coefficients are smaller in absolute value. In
particular, colonial linkages are no longer statistically significant. However, the distance is
even stronger. The r-squareds in the real specifications are slightly lower than in the nominal
specifications.
Our results also hold for real exchange rates, echoing Mussa (1986); Flood and Rose
(1995)’s observation that real exchange rates largely track the nominal ones, even if the

nominal exchange rate is fixed. The sensitivity of changes in the real exchange rate to
the base factor is governed by the same economic forces, and the coefficients have similar
magnitudes. The only exception is the effect of colonial linkages. Engel (1999) attributes
most of the variation in U.S. real exchange rates to the relative prices of tradeables. Based
on extrapolation of Engel (1999)’s decomposition, our findings imply that the relative prices
of tradeables in countries that are economically distant, and hence trade less, will be more
sensitive to the common factor. Conversely, the factor structure in relative prices will be
weaker in countries that are close and trade more intensely. In product-level data, there
is evidence that producer-currency pricing (price stickiness) may account for some of these
effects3 (see, e.g., Nakamura and Steinsson, 2008; Gopinath and Rigobon, 2008). Recent
evidence suggests that these effects are not entirely due to price stickiness. Burstein and
Jaimovich (2009) find evidence in U.S-Canadian product-level data that active pricing-tomarket, i.e. changes in the mark-ups contingent on the location of the sale, accounts for a
lot of the variation in the relative prices of tradeables. Interestingly, we even find similar
effects of distance on real exchange rate co-variation within the Euro zone.

3.4

Average R2 by Base Currency

Table (6) reports the results of a regression of the average R2 for each country on measures
of average distance of that country from others. These regressions corresond to Figure (2).
As expected, countries which are on-average more distant from other countries have bilateral
exchange rates which are more exposed to systematic risk.

3

In these models, flexible exchange rates are a good substitute for flexible prices and facilitate the adjustment to country-specific shocks. (For an equilibrium model, see Obstfeld and Rogoff, 1995)

Calibrated LRR Model

As illustrated in Section (1.1), the base factor loadings provide a measure of exposure to
common shocks. To demonstrate how the base factor loadings relate to the structural parameters of a long run risk model, we calibrate the single factor model in Section (1.1). Our
calibration follows Colacito and Croce (2011), with the specific parameters given in Table
(7).

We begin by limiting ourselves to base factor loadings with respect to the British pound
and calibrating the κ∗ to match the cross-section of these base factor loadings. The results
are illustrated in Figure (3) which plots the loadings on the persistent, common component
of consumption growth versus distance from the UK. Clearly, there is a strong negative
relation between the implied κ∗ values and distance. The specific relation is given by:
κ∗ = 1.46 − 0.11 × log distance
The fact that the implied κ∗ have a negative relation with distance is a direct consequence
of the negative monotonic relation between base factor loadings and κ∗ in Proposition (2)
and that the base factor loadings are increasing in distance. As explained in Section (1.1),
this result is intuitive: If countries are closer to each other it is plausible that they will be
more exposed to similar risks thank countries which are more distant from each other. This
calibration illustrates how the base factor loadings provide a new way to measure exposure to
shocks in international asset pricing models. The key insight is that the base factor loadings
isolate exposure to common shocks.
To better understand quantitatively how exposure to long-run risk relates to measures of
distance, we perform the same calibration for each developed base country. That is, we fix
the loading on the persistent component of consumption growth to 1 for the base country and

exposure to global factors. The base country is limited to be the UK. Base factor loadings,
ϕ∗i,j , are from the regression ∆si,j,t = αi,j + ϕ∗i,j ∆basei,t + ei,j,t . For each currency j, basei,t is
the average appreciation of currency i at time t relative to all available currencies, excluding

We then regress these κ∗ values on gravity variables. The results are in Table (8). These
regressions include a base country fixed effect to control for the fact that we fix the base
country κ = 1. As in the UK only calibration, the calibrated κ∗ are in general decreasing
in distance. These results provide additional moments for international models of exchange
rate determination to target and provide additional insight into the fundamental source of
hetereogeneity in exposure to global risk.

5.1

Robustness
Developed Currencies

Table (B8) considers only the subset of developed countries, using the MSCI designation of
developed countries. In this subsample, the distance effect is even stronger. In specifications
(1)-(3), the effect of log distance on the loading is around 0.23, compared to 0.14. Some of
the other variables are no longer enter significantly. Shared legal origin lowers the loading
by more than 0.3 when pegs are removed. These variables jointly account for about 1/3 of
the variation in the loadings.

5.2

All Currencies

Table (B9) presents results using data for all 162 countries in our sample. When we expand
beyond the subset of MSCI developed and emerging countries, all gravity effects remain
significant, but the coefficients are mitigated. A log point increase in distance increases the
base factor loading by 3 bps, compared to 14 bps in the developed and emerging subset.

5.3

Trade and GDP

Table (B10) presents results controlling for bilateral imports plus exports to GDP of the
foreign country and for the GDP share of the base country. Column (1) presents results only
controlling for bilateral exports and imports normalized by foreign country’s GDP. More
trade between the foreign country and the base country, relative to the foreign country’s
GDP, lowers the base factor loading. Surprisingly, the R-squared in this regression is only
3%, despite the fact that gravity variables explain trade intensities quite well. Column (3)
includes a control for the size of the base country. Column (4) includes both trade to GDP
and GDP shares.

5.4

Financial Asset Holdings

Table (B11) presents results controlling for various forms of bilateral asset holdings as reported by the IMF Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey. Asset holdings are measured
as total assets held by each foreign country in the base country and are normalized by GDP
or total assets held. The results echo those of the trade regressions – asset holdings do lower

30

base factor loadings, but the amount of variance that is explained by the asset holdings is
small compared to that of the gravity variables.

5.5

Fixed Effects

Table (B12) presents results with different fixed effects. Column (1) is without any fixed
effects, column (2) has year fixed effects, column (2) has base-country year fixed effects, and
column (4) has base-coutry year and year fixed effects. The key takeaway is that the different
fixed effects do not affect the qualitative of quantitve implications of our gravity model.

5.6

Persistence

It could be the case that the increase in global financial integration has lowered the explanatory power of gravity variables on base factor loadings over time. To examine this,
Figure (B1) plots 15-year rolling sample R-squared values. Interestingly, the R-squared has
remained remarkably stable for both the developed country subset and the 47 developed and
emerging country subset.

5.7

Currency Unions

This section presents regressions for just the euro subset. Base factors are constructed only
using real data on the subset of euro area countries. The results are from 1999-2014. Table
(B13) reports the results. Even in this Euro subset, the real exchange rate co-variation
is consistent with the gravity effects we have documented. In a univariate regression of
the loadings on log distance, the slope coefficient is 0.13, similar to the effects we have
documented in the full sample. Siimlarly, the coefficient on shared language is -0.29.

Conclusion

When Fed chairman Bernanke signaled an end to large-scale asset purchases in May 2013,
some emerging market currencies subsequently depreciated by more than 25% against the
USD, while other currencies did not depreciate at all (Nechio et al., 2014). What governs
the differential response of currencies to a monetary policy shock, or any other shocks, in
the U.S.? Are these mostly due to differences in policies and economic conditions across
countries? Our paper shows that the differential response of currencies to these types of

31

shocks are determined to a large extent by initial conditions that are completely outside of
the control of monetary and fiscal policy.

We first use a log-linear approximation of the wealth return. We then assume that the
price-consumption ratio is linear in the state variables. Finally, we check this conjecture and
compute the corresponding coefficients by using the log-linear Euler equation.

where κ1 = exp(p − c)/(1 + exp(p − c)) and κ0 = log(1 + exp(p − c)) − (p − c)κ1 . Define
the log price-consumption ratio zt as pt − ct . We now have a log-linear approximation of the

Statistical Factor Models of Exchange Rates

We consider a simple, statistical (latent) factor model for exchange rate variation. There are
multiple latent factors driving exchange rate variation:
∆si,j,t = αi,j + γ 0i,j f t + ui,j,t ,

(7)

where si,j,t denotes the time t log exchange rate in units of currency j per unit of currency
i and f t denotes a K × 1 vector of orthogonal factors. An increase in si,j,t implies an
appreciation of currency i relative to currency j. Collecting terms, we can write this factor
model in vector notation: ∆si,t = Γ0 + Γi f t + ui,t , where Γi is the N × K matrix of
loadings. The variance-covariance matrix of exchange rates is Γi Γ0i + Σe,i . From triangular
arbitrage, we know that ∆si,j,t − ∆si,k,t = ∆sk,j,t . That implies the following restriction on
0
0
0
. Triangular arbitrage implies that the matrix of loadings satisfy
= γk,j
−γi,k
the loadings: γi,j
the following restrictions : e0j Γi − e0k Γi = e0j Γk , and the disturbances satisfy the following
restrictions: e0j ui − e0k ui = e0j uk , where e0j is an N × 1 vector of zero with a one in the j-th
position. Hence, the variance-covariance matrix is singular.
The latent factors can include global FX factors such as the dollar factor and the carry
trade factors. Our setup also allows for N local factors in f t , i.e. factors that are specific
to country i and only affects bilateral exchange rates between i and some other country j,
but have no effect on other bilateral exchange rates that do not involve i. These are fixed
0
0
effects for home country and time. Factor i is local to country i if and only if γi,j
(i) = γi,k
(i),
0
implying that γk,j (i) = 0 for all k, j. Complete market models give rise to local factors if
their SDFs are subject to country-specific shocks.
Each base factor is a different linear combination of the underlying factors basei,t = δ 0i f t ,
given by
1 X
1 X 0
1 X
∆basei,t =
∆si,k,t =
γi,k f t +
ui,k,t .
N − 1 k6=j
N − 1 k6=j
N − 1 k6=j
As N → ∞, the L.L.N. implies that last term converges to zero. The base factor eliminates
idiosyncratic noise. We construct the base factor for country k, which is a different linear

40

combination of the underlying factors:

1 X
1 X 0

∆basek,t =
∆sk,j,t =
γ i,j − γ 0i,k f t +
ui,k,t .
N − 1 j6=k
N − 1 j6=k
N − 1 j6=k
Note that the local i-factor will drop out from the base factor. That follows immediately
from the restriction on the factor loadings. Since this is a different linear combination, each
country’s loadings on the new base factor will differ as well. Why examine different base
currencies? We cannot identify the N × K coefficients from only N − 1 different independent
loadings with respect to one base factor. Hence, we exploit the entire cross-section. If there
are N local factors, then each base currency adds novel information.
Simple Example with Two Factors To build some intuition, we consider a simple
example with two exchange rate factors:
∆si,j,t = αi,j + γ i,j (1)ft,1 + γ i,j (2)ft,2 + ui,j,t .

(8)

We construct the base factor,

1 X

∆si,k,t =
γ i,k (1)ft,1 + γ i,k (2)ft,2 +
ui,k,t
∆basei,t =
N − 1 k6=j
N − 1 k6=j
N − 1 k6=j
As N → ∞, the L.L.N. implies that last term converges to zero. The base factor eliminates
idiosyncratic noise.
In our paper, the object of interest is the slope coefficient in a projection of the exchange
rate changes on the base factor. For large N , this slope coefficient is given by:

where we have used the orthogonality of the factors. The slope coefficient only depends on
the currency factor loadings and the volatility of the factors. When we switch to a new base
country, the change in spot exchange rates are given by:

∆skjt = (αi,j − αi,k ) + γ i,j (1) − γ i,k (1) ft,1 + (γi,j (2) − γi,k (2)) ft,2 + ui,j,t − ui,k,t .

(10)

We construct the base factor for country k, which is a different linear combination of the
underlying factors:

In general, there is no simple mapping from one set of base factor loadings to another,
because the new base factor is a different linear combination of the fundamental exchange
rate factors. However, suppose that the first factor is country i’s local factor. Then k’s base
factor is not exposed to i’s local factor:

Hence, local factors to country i are eliminated when we switch base factor.
Simple Example with Single Factor Suppose that there is a single latent factor (e.g.
the dollar factor) driving all of the currency variation; we can easily derive the loadings for
any bilateral exchange rate. Suppose we switch to a new base currency k. Theloadings on

which is an affine transformation of the ϕ∗i,j . There is no additional information from switching to a different base currency in a single factor world. Essentially, the same single factor

42

model applies for base currency k:
∆skjt = (αi,j − αi,k ) + (γi,j − γi,k ) ft + ui,j,t − ui,k,t .

(11)

In this single factor world, we only really need to analyze one base currency. The new slope
coefficients γk,j = (γi,j − γi,k ) can be backed out from the other ones. A single factor specification counterfactually implies that the bilateral exchange rate for equidistant countries
from the base country (e.g. the U.S.) does not load on the (dollar) factor.

Spot rates for countries which adopt the euro are omitted after the adoption date. The

43

euro series starts on January 1, 1999. End-of-month series are constructed from the daily
data.
CPI data is from GFD and is used to calculate real exchange rate changes. For countries
which only provide quarterly CPI data, we interpolate a monthly series. CPI observations
where month-over-month continuously compounded inflation is greater than 50% are omitted. We also omit Armenia, Ukraine, Herzegovina, Serbia, Nicaragua, Peru, and Brazil from
the CPI data due to hyperinflation episodes.
Country classifications (developed, emerging, and frontier) are from MSCI 4 as of August
2015.

B.2

Gravity Data

Below is a description and source for each of the gravity variables in our dataset.
Distance — Population weighted average distance in kilometers between large cities’ of each
country pair (Mayer and Zignago (2011)).
Shared Language — Common language is 1 if a language is spoken by over 9% of the
population in both countries (Mayer and Zignago (2011)).
Shared Legal — Dummy variable from a classification of countries’ legal origins. See Porta,
Lopez-de Silanes, and Shleifer (2007) for a description and discussion.
Colonial Link — A dummy variable which is 1 if countries have shared a common colonizer
after 1945. See Mayer and Zignago (2011).
Resource similarity — We obtain a list of natural resources by country from the CIA
world factbok5 . Using this list, we construct vectors of dummy variables — 1 if a country
has the resource, 0 otherwise. Natural resource similarity between two countries is the cosine
similarity of the vectors of resource dummy variables.
Linguistic similarity — Population weighted measure of linguistic proximity based upon
language trees. A higher value implies that the average language spoken within the two
countries diverged more recently. Data is from Desmet, Ortuno-Ortin, and Wacziarg (2012).
Genetic distance — Weighted genetic distance between population subgroups within country pairs. Genetic distance is calculated off of differences in allele frequency. A higher value
implies that the population within the two countries diverged genetically at a more recent
date. The data is from Spolaore and Wacziarg (2009).

Peg Dummy — A currency is considered pegged if the bilateral exchange rate volatility is
less than 2% in two consecutive years. The peg dummy is 1 if either currency was pegged to
the other or both currencies were pegged to the same currency at any point in the sample.
For the 5-year rolling samples, the peg dummy is 1 if either currency was pegged to other or
they were pegged same currency at any point in the prior 6 years. The data on pegs is from
Shambaugh (2004).

B.3

Calculation of Standard Errors

The triangular arbitrage condition for exchange rates requires careful calculation of standard
errors in our regressions. Consider the general factor model in Equation (7):
∆si,j,t = αi,j + γ 0i,j f t + ei,j,t .

(12)

From triangular arbitrage, ∆si,k = ∆si,j − ∆sk,j , which implies γ i,k = γ i,j − γ k,j . This
relation is true for any factors f , including base factors, which are a linear combination
of the underlying factors. This implies that base factor loadings may be correlated if they
contain the same base or foreign country. As a result, there may be correlation in the errors
in our primary regression specifications:
ϕ∗i,j = δ + λGi,j + ei,j .
We accommodate for this by using dyadic clustering as in Cameron and Miller (2014) and
Aronow, Samii, and Assenova (2015). The latter paper uses the multi-way clustering algorithm of Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller (2011), which we apply in this paper. These
standard errors allow for arbitrary correlation when an observation contains the same country — whether base or foreign. Specifically, we assume that
E [ei,j ei0 ,j 0 |Gi,j , Gi0 ,j 0 ] = 0 unless i = i0 or j = j 0 or i = j 0 or j = i0 .
Table (B1) illustrates the importance of correctly estimating the standard errors.
Columns 1 and 2 only cluster on base country or foreign country respectively. Column
3 clusters on both base country and foreign country. All three of these columns have smaller
standard error estimates than column 4 which uses dyadic clustering. Clustering on base
country and foreign country (column 3) produces standard errors that are closest to the
dyadic clustering, consistent with the findings of Cameron and Miller (2014).

Summary statistics of data from the regression ∆si,j,t =
for each possible base currency i. ∆si,j,t is
the log real change in the bilateral exchange rate calculated by substracting differences in log inflation. For each currency
j, basei,t is the average appreciation of currency i at time t relative to all available currencies, excluding currency j. Base
Var, FX Var, and Id Var are cross-sectional means for each base currency. Base Var is the variance attributed to the base
factor, FX Var is the total variance, and Id Var is the remaining idiosyncratic variance. R2 mean is the cross-sectional
mean of the R2 for each base currency. Load Sd is the standard deviation of the loadings ϕ∗i,j for each base currency
i. Spot rates are monthly from January 1973 until December 2014 from Global Financial Data for 24 developed and 23
emerging countries, as classified by MSCI.
