ABSTRACT
We examine the within- and across-firm shipment decisions of tens of thousands of goodsproducing and distributing establishments. This allows us to quantify the normally unobservable
forces that determine firm boundaries; which transactions are mediated by ownership control, as
opposed to contracts or markets. We find firm boundaries to be an economically significant
barrier to trade: having an additional vertically integrated establishment in a given destination zip
code has the same effect on shipment volumes as a 40 percent reduction in distance. We then
calibrate a multisector trade model to quantify the economy-wide implications of transacting
across vs. within firm boundaries.

Introduction

A vast literature initiated by Coase (1937) has sought to build an economic theory of the firm.
A central question in this work regards what forces determine which transactions occur within
firm boundaries as opposed to across them. The literature has put forward many possible
explanations for why some transactions are better moderated by the firm. Among the more
prominent classes of explanations include the transaction costs theories first developed by
Williamson (1971, 1973, 1979) and Klein, Crawford, and Alchain (1978), the property rights
theory in Grossman and Hart (1986) and Hart and Moore (1990), the ownership-as-incentiveinstrument structure of Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991) and Holmstrom and Tirole (1991),
the resource-based view of Wernerfelt (1984), the routines-based theory of Nelson and Winter
(1982), and the knowledge-based explanation of Kogut and Zander (1992).1
The considerable empirical literature spurred by these theories has studied how such
factors influence firm formation, size, and scope. The modal analysis in this literature
identifies a likely (and hopefully exogenous) source of variation in the net gains to keeping
a transaction inside the firm (e.g., greater capital specificity) and then relates this variation
to observed outcomes in firm structure. The estimated object of interest is the sign of the
comparative static (e.g., do increases in capital specificity increase the extent of vertical
integration) and occasionally the magnitude of the relationship between the explanatory
variable and firm structure outcomes.
What has not been attempted, however, is an estimate of actual magnitudes of the
net benefits of internal transactions — the actual size of avoided transaction costs, or the
benefit of retaining residual rights of control through ownership, or the advantage of internal
incentives, and so on. This strikes us as an important missing piece. These benefits, after
all, are the core empirical object in theories of the firm. Yet we do not know how big they
actually are, or how they vary in magnitude with aspects of the market environment. There

Gibbons (2005) discusses these various theories and distills the transaction cost, property rights, and
incentive explanations into four formal theoretical structures.

are several reasons for this dearth of estimates of the magnitudes of “what makes a firm, a
firm.” First, by their nature, the factors proposed by the theoretical literature tend to be
shadow values. They are explicitly about non-market transactions and often about costs
that aren’t paid, so they are inherently difficult to measure. More practically, even if one
could imagine constructing a reasonable measure of these shadow values (using the payroll of
a company’s procurement department as a measure of transaction costs, for example), this
would require highly detailed data to construct. Further still, if such data exist, it would
only be for specific firms in specific markets, and perhaps only for specific transactions. It
would be difficult to extend any such measures to more general settings, at least without
some model that empirically relates a transaction’s observables to its net benefit of keeping
that transaction within the firm.
This paper proposes a method to measure the magnitude of the forces that shape firm
boundaries. Our approach uses a firm-side analogue to the consumer concept of revealed
preference to measure the shadow values of keeping transactions inside a firm. Specifically,
we use firms’ revealed choices about what, where, and to whom to ship to measure the
implied shadow values of in-house transactions.
We detail our approach below, but the basic logic is simple. An extensive empirical
literature has established that transaction volumes decline in distance because of various
costs ranging from physical transport costs to monitoring to coordination and beyond. If
we observe, all else equal, that firms are systematically willing to send internal shipments
further (or equivalently, to have a greater volume of internal than external transactions at
any given distance), this implies that they perceive internal shipments as being less costly.
And because we observe the overall relationship between shipment volumes and distance,
which lets us characterize the magnitude of distance-based costs, we can obtain a cardinal
measure of the “distance premium” of internal shipments — the perceived cost savings of
keeping transactions within the firm. In other words, differences in the patterns of firms’
within- and across-firm shipments reveal the hurdle they perceive for transacting outside
3

their borders. We do not need to see these costs directly the in the data. Firm behavior and
the volume-distance relationship reveal to us what they are.
Besides allowing us to measure what to this point has not been quantified, our approach has other advantages. For one, our estimates are obtained based on behavior at the
transaction level. This is the theoretically exact margin at which the firm’s boundaries are
determined. Additionally, we can apply our method to a wide swath of transactions, firms,
and markets. We analyze millions of shipments (our transaction-level observation) from
tens of thousands of establishments in the goods-producing and goods-distributing sectors
in the U.S. This allows us to characterize how our estimated shadow values vary with observables about the product being transacted, the production function of the firm, and even
the attributes of specific transactions.2
We find that the net benefits of keeping transactions in house are substantial. They
are equivalent in magnitude to the costs associated with increasing the distance between
separately owned counterparties by 40 percent. Moreover, the organizational and spatial
structure of economic activity is significantly shaped by the forces that determine the boundaries of the firm. We characterize systematic patterns in the heterogeneity of firm boundary
effects across different settings, finding that the net benefits of within-firm transactions are
larger for more distant shipments, high value-to-weight products, more differentiated products, in industries that are more IT-capital intensive, and for establishments that produce
goods rather than just convey them. We also address the potential bias created by the endogeneity of establishment ownership and location. Finally, we compute the aggregate welfare
implications of the mitigation of costs conferred by common ownership.
These results extend and qualify the conclusions drawn from our earlier work (Atalay, Hortaçsu, and Syverson, 2014). In this earlier paper we documented that, for a large
2
It is important to note that our “revealed preference” approach allows us to remain agnostic about
the specific source(s) of the shadow benefits of keeping transactions in house, be they transaction cost
savings, residual rights of control, advantages of incentive structures, some other factor, or any combination
thereof. A firm’s decisions tell us how large it perceives these benefits to be, not the specific mechanism(s)
through which they arise. This cost does come with a benefit, though; we do not need to rely on untestable
assumptions about the source for measurement.

fraction of firms that own establishments in vertically related industries, upstream establishments make almost all of their shipments to downstream establishments in other firms.
We interpreted this empirical finding as signifying that for many firms that own production
chains, the primary rationale for common ownership is to facilitate within-firm flows of intangible rather than physical inputs. However, this does not necessarily imply that the costs
of making across-firm transactions (relative to internal transactions) are small. The relative
frequencies of within-firm and across-firm transactions are a function of many characteristics
(including firm identity, distance, and productivity) of the potential suppliers and customers
with whom establishments can trade. The magnitude of firm boundary costs are identifiable
only relative to other costs that make transactions across buyers and sellers more or less
likely.
Besides the work mentioned above, our study relates to a recent literature examining
how the forces that shape firm boundaries interact with firms’ decisions about their location
and scope. Fally and Hilberry (2015) construct a multi-industry, multi-country trade model
with the goal of examining how declining transaction costs affect the within-country and
international fragmentation of production chains. The main tradeoff in their model balances
transaction costs against within-firm coordination costs. Tasks are integrated within the
firm to save on the costs of transacting with suppliers or customers, but because of increasing marginal costs of coordinating tasks within the firm, not all tasks within a production
chain are performed by the same firm. As transaction costs decline, product line fragmentation increases, and activity is spread out over a larger number of countries. Along similar
lines, Forman and McElheran (2017) find that the diffusion of IT-enabled coordination tools
between firms along supply chains is associated with a reduction in vertical integration of
those chains, and Fort (2017) uses detailed data from manufacturers’ purchases of contracted
services to demonstrate that declining across-firm communication costs have fragmented production, especially for products whose specifications can be codified electronically. Antràs
and Chor (2013) model a multi-stage production process where the value of the final good
5

is a function of investments made at each stage. Each stage may either be integrated with
the final producer or outsourced to a supplier. A key prediction of the model is that integration at later (resp. earlier) stages of production is more likely when investments along the
chain are strategic complements (resp. strategic substitutes). They empirically test and find
support for this prediction using aggregate data from the Census Related Party Database
(this result is reaffirmed in firm-level data in Alfaro et al., 2015). In sum, this literature
fits within the broader pattern of empirical work that has examined comparative statics regarding the how differences in proxies for transaction costs, property rights, and so on shape
firm boundaries. Our complementary contribution is to measure the actual magnitude of the
costs associated with transacting across firm boundaries and as such shape a firm’s decision
about where to draw its borders.
Our work also has ties to the vast literature that has used gravity models to infer the costs
associated with transacting with faraway counterparties; see Anderson and van Wincoop
(2004), Costinot and Rodríguez-Clare (2014), and Head and Mayer (2014) for syntheses of
this literature.3 As emphasized in these literature reviews, the gravity equation of trade —
according to which the flows of goods or services across two regions is directly proportional to
the size of these regions and inversely proportional to the distance between them — emerges
as the prediction of a broad class of trade models. In this paper, we apply the particular
model proposed by Eaton, Kortum, and Sotelo (2012) to generate our estimating equations.
Their model is particularly useful in our context, as it accounts for the possibility of zero
trade flows across pairs of regions, which are pervasive in our dataset. Our contribution in
this paper is to leverage what is known from the gravity equation literature about distancebased trade impediments to obtain an estimate of across-firm transaction costs.
3

McCallum (1995) provides one of the first attempts to infer the “width” of national borders from trade
flows. A complementary literature uses deviations from the law of one price as a way to measure the costs
of trading across regions. We owe the title of our paper to an exemplar of this literature, Engel and Rogers
(1996).

2

The Gravity Equation

The framework we use to predict trade flows from establishments to destination zip codes
borrows heavily from Eaton, Kortum, and Sotelo (2012). In particular, we adopt the model
elements which yield a gravity equation that is both relatively simple to derive and allows for
zero trade flows between pairs of regions. This latter element is important, as zero trade flows
are common in our data. The model also aggregates up from the establishment level nicely.
This is very useful, as while our data is extremely detailed, it does have one limitation in
that we observe a shipment’s destination zip code rather than its destination establishment
within that zip code. We can use the model to directly derive an estimating equation that
uses this more aggregate destination information.
We make two minor amendments to the Eaton, Kortum, and Sotelo (2012) model. First,
we characterize the expected flows from specific sending establishments to destination regions (zip codes in the data as discussed above), as opposed to having both the origin and
destination represent regions. Second, critically for our empirical question, we permit transaction costs to be lower when the sending and receiving establishment belong to the same
firm.
Establishments operate in 1, ..., Z zip codes, with potentially multiple establishments
located in each destination zip code z. Establishments (“plants”) can both produce/send
and use/receive commodities. Each produces a single, horizontally-differentiated traded
commodity.4 Denote the identity of a potential receiving establishment with its location z e ,
and similarly refer to the sending establishment as ie .5
4

In the empirical application in Section 4, we construct market shares separately by commodity. We omit
commodity-level superscripts throughout this section for notational simplicity. The analysis in this section
can easily be extended to multiple traded commodities with constant expenditure on each commodity. This
can be accommodated by a model in which a representative consumer in each zip code has Cobb-Douglas
preferences over commodities; in Section 5, we discuss a multi-industry model along these lines.
5
We do not attempt to directly model firms’ decisions on where to locate their establishments, or which
establishments to own, as in Antràs (2005), Keller and Yeaple (2013), or Ramondo and Rodríguez-Clare
(2013). In an international setting, the aforementioned trade models emphasize that related-party vs. armslength trade are substitutes. A richer, more complete model would analyze location and ownership choices
in combination which establishments’ sourcing decisions. Due to the complexity of modeling both sets of
choices in our context, in which there are thousands of possible locations, we do not pursue this richer model.

7

Each sending establishment has access to a (random) number of linear production technologies, each which allows it to transform l units of labor into vl units of output. We
assume that v is Pareto distributed with shape parameter θ and a lower cutoff v̄ that can
be set arbitrarily close to 0. We also assume that the (integer) number of establishment ie ’s
varieties with efficiency V > v̄ (for v > v̄) is the realization of a Poisson random variable
with mean Tie v −θ . In this expression, Tie reflects the overall productivity of establishment
ie .
Call xi the cost of a unit of labor inputs for establishments in zip code i. There are
also iceberg-style transportation costs which vary not only in distance, but also based on
ownership. Specifically, for establishment ie to sell one unit of the commodity to plant
z e , it must produce dzie ≥ 1 units of output if plant z e is owned by a different firm and
dzie δzie ≥ 1 units of output if the same firm owns it. Furthermore, forming a relationship
with establishment z e requires a fixed number of workers Fze to be hired in zip code z.
Given these assumptions, the unit cost of a variety with an idiosyncratic productivity
draw v selling to plant z e is
ψ ze ie (v) =

where 1SF is an indicator for a within-firm relationship between establishments ie and z e .
Using properties of the Poisson distribution, the number of varieties that can be sold to
establishment z e at a cost less than or equal to ψ is the realization of a Poisson random
variable with parameter Φze ψ θ , with

relate to establishments’ entry and pricing decisions. We assume that i) upstream establishments compete monopolistically when serving each downstream establishment, ii) the
downstream establishment z e combines inputs form its suppliers according to a CES aggregator, iii) each upstream establishment takes as given the downstream establishment’s
intermediate input “ideal price index” Pze and total expenditures Xze on intermediate inputs, and iv) upstream establishments sell to z e (referred to as entry) as long as profits are
non-negative, with low-cost potential entrants making their decisions first.
This setup provides three results on the margins of trade. First, conditional on entry,
sales of different entrants are independent of the cost parameters xi , dzie , and δ zie . These
parameters affect only the extensive margin of trade, not the intensive margin. Second,
the probability that a given variety produced by establishment ie is among the lowest-cost
varieties that are able to profitably enter is given by:

of Gamma distributed random variables (see their footnote 21), and are independent across
ie − z pairs.7 With randomly distributed εz,ie , there are two sources of randomness: First,
establishments’ technologies have stochastic productivity. Second, the iceberg trade costs
for each sending establishment-destination pair are randomly distributed. In combination
with our assumption on the distribution of εz,ie , plugging Equation 5 into Equation 4 yields
a relatively simple expression for the expected market share as a function of a) sendingestablishment specific terms, b) pair-specific observable variables, and c) a summation of
destination-specific terms:

Here, conditioning on Λ indicates that there is some random component of trade flows, due
to the ε terms, and that our expression for the expected trade flows is a function of the
observed distance and ownership variables. And, αie ≡ α0 + log Tie − θ log xi collects all of
the relevant sending establishment specific unobservable terms.
There are two possible approaches to estimate the parameters involved in the expression

The destination fixed effects in Equation 7 capture the terms in the denominator in Equation
6. This theoretically-motivated specification produces consistent estimates of the same-firm
share, distance, and interaction terms.
One drawback of this approach is that with tens of thousands of sending establishments
and tens of thousands of destination zip codes, it is computationally taxing. As an alternative approach, in most of our specifications we follow the earlier literature on gravity equation estimation and regress

Xzie
Xz

against sending establishment fixed effects, distance terms,

and destination-specific multilateral resistance terms (as discussed in Baier and Bergstrand,
2009). These multilateral resistance terms involve subtracting off a first-order Taylor approximation of the terms in the denominator of the right-hand-side of Equation 6. Namely,
for each pair-specific explanatory variable, gzie , our regressions include gzie − g z· − g ·ie + g
as the covariate; g z· , g ·ie , and g respectively denote the average value of the of the covariate
gzie for a given establishment ie , for a given destination zip code z, or across all sending
establishment-destination zip code pairs. In essence, the multilateral resistance terms apply
the mechanics of linear models with two-way fixed effects to the gravity relationship.
An appropriate estimator for either specification is the multinomial pseudo maximum
likelihood estimator, which can be implemented via a Poisson regression; see Head and
Mayer (2014; Section 5.2) or Sotelo (2017).

Data Sources and Definitions

Our analysis employs two large-scale data sets maintained by the U.S. Census: the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) and the Commodity Flow Survey (CFS). We supplement
these data with two sets of industry-level definitions from past work: our definitions of
12

vertically-related industry pairs (from Atalay, Hortaçsu, and Syverson, 2014) and Rauch
(1999)’s product differentiation classification.
Our benchmark sample is drawn from the establishments surveyed in the 2007 Commodity Flow Survey. Like its predecessors, the 2007 CFS contains a sample of establishments
operating in the economy’s goods-producing and goods-distributing sectors: mining; manufacturing; wholesale; electronic shopping and mail-order houses; and newspaper, book, and
music publishers. Once per quarter, each surveyed establishment is asked to report up to
40 randomly selected shipments that it made on a given week in that quarter. Relevant for
our purposes, the data include each shipment’s origin and destination zip code, weight, and
dollar value. The sample contains approximately 4.3 million shipments made by roughly
58,000 establishments. Because we are interested in characterizing the shipment patterns
of establishments that could make same-firm shipments, we only keep establishments from
multi-unit firms. This reduces the sample size to approximately 35,000 establishments.8 We
also limit our analysis to domestic shipments. While the CFS includes shipments for export,
the data only reports the zip code of the shipment’s port of departure from the U.S. and
its destination country; we do not see the specific destination within the foreign country or
anything about ownership of the receiving establishment. Thus we cannot construct either
of the key variables for our analysis for exports.
While the CFS is a shipment-level dataset, we sum up across shipments within a surveyed
establishment-destination zip code pair to obtain each observation in our analysis dataset.9
We create the sample as follows. We first segment the 2007 CFS by 6-digit North American
Industry Classification System (NAICS) industry of the shipping plant. For each industry,
we collect all destination zip codes that receive at least one shipment from industry establishments. We then create the Cartesian product of all shipping plants and all destination zip
8

Census disclosure rules prohibit us from providing exact sample size counts throughout this paper.
Note that the CFS allows us to observe the destination zip code of the shipment, not the identity of
the particular recipient establishment. This is why our level of observation is demarcated by a (shipping)
establishment on one side but a zip code on the other. It means we must infer internal shipments as a
function of the prevalence of downstream establishments owned by the shipping establishment’s firm rather
than being able to observe these internal shipments directly.
9

13

codes for that industry. Our sample consists of the aggregation of these Cartesian products
across all 6-digit industries. Our benchmark sample has 190 million sending establishmentdestination zip code observations.
The main variables of interest in next section’s empirical specification are the market
share and distance measures. The market share for a shipping plant ie in destination z is the
total value of shipments from ie to z divided by the total shipments sent to z by all plants
in ie ’s 6-digit NAICS industry to z. Our main analysis relates this market share to measures
of the distance, be they literal or figurative, between ie and the establishments located in
zip code z. The physical, great circle distance between two zip codes is straightforward
to compute using information on the zip codes’ longitudes and latitudes. A key figurative
distance measure szie is the fraction of downstream establishments in zip code z owned by the
same firm that owns establishment ie ; below, we call this variable the “same-firm ownership
fraction.” To compute this fraction, we restrict attention to the establishments in zip code
z that could conceivably use the product establishment ie is shipping. For example, if ie
is a cement manufacturer, we would not want to include dairy producers, auto wholesalers,
or gas stations when computing szie . To discern which establishments are downstream of
ie and could in turn conceivably use ie ’s output, we apply the algorithm introduced in our
earlier paper (Atalay, Hortaçsu, and Syverson, 2014). Namely, we find industry pairs I, J
for which at least one percent of the output of industry I is purchased by establishments n
industry J. Then, when computing szie for each establishment ie ∈ I we sum only over the
plants in zip code z that belong to a downstream industry J.
Table 1 presents summary statistics for our sample of establishment-destination zip code
pairs. Panel A indicates, first, that the total value shipped (summing across all potential
sending establishments ie ) is highly skewed. While the median 6-digit product-destination
zip code shipment total is around $1.6 million, the mean is around $14 million. Second, the
average market share,

Xzie
,
Xz

equals 0.004. Only 0.7 percent of sending establishments have

any shipments to z. In short, zero trade flows are exceedingly common in our sample of ie -z
14

pairs.
Panels B and C split ie -z pairs by the presence or absence of shipments from ie to z. The
two takeaways from these panels are that a) establishments tend to ship to zip codes that
contain some potential counterparties with which they share ownership, but b) same-firm
shares are still low, even in zip codes that receive at least one shipment. For the mean ie -z
pair, 12.9 establishments in z belong to industries downstream of sender ie . But of these
12.9, only 0.01 establishments on average share ownership with the sender. Shipments are
more likely to be sent to zip codes in which at least one of the potential recipients belongs
to the same firm as the sender. For destination zip codes that receive at least one shipment
from ie , 0.51 percent of the potential recipients share ownership with the sender, compared
to 0.09 percent when no shipment is sent.
Panel D offers a summary of shipment distances. Establishments under common ownership tend to be closer to one another. For ie -z pairs with a potential recipient in z owned by
the firm that also owns ie , the 10th percentile distance is 184 miles, and the 25th and 50th
percentile distances are 411 and 804 miles, respectively. In contrast, for pairs in which no
such common ownership links exist, the 10th, 25th, and 50th percentile distances are uniformly larger: 264, 501, and 866 miles. Also, not surprisingly (and consistent with gravity
models of the type we leverage in this paper), shipments become less likely as the distance
to a potential recipient increase. The median distance between sending establishments and
potential destinations that receive at least one shipment is 254 miles, while it is 870 miles
for pairs with no shipments.
To sum up, we can draw the following three conclusions from Table 1. First, for any
particular destination zip code, it is rare for there to be an establishment sharing ownership
with the sender. Second, pairs of establishments that are owned by the same firm and
belong to vertically-related industries tend to be located closer to one another than the
typical upstream-downstream pair. Finally, a potential destination zip code that contains an
establishment sharing ownership with the sending firm tends to receive more shipments. So,

Notes: The sample consists of pairs of sending establishments and destination zip codes, ie -z, for which at least one shipment by an
establishment in the same industry as ie was sent to zip code z. The market share equals the ratio of the shipments sent by ie to zip
code z, relative to the total amount sent by all establishments in the same industry as ie to zip code z. The total number of ie -z pairs in
the sample is 189.6 million. Of these, for 1.4 million there is at least one shipment from ie to z (and 188.2 million with no shipments).
Of the 189.6 million ie -z pairs, the same-firm ownership fraction is greater than 0 for 1.4 million pairs (and zero for the remaining 188.1
million pairs).

4.1

Benchmark Specification

Table 2 reports our baseline regression results relating distance and ownership to the share
of a zip code’s purchases of a given product purchased from a sending establishment ie .
The columns differ according to how we model the relationship between distance and the
market share (either logarithmically or more flexibly, with a sequence of categorical variables)
and which multilateral resistance term we include (whether the averages that are being
subtracted off of the distance and ownership measures are weighted by the trade flows or are
unweighted).10 Through the tradeoffs between distance and ownership, firms reveal in their
shipment patterns the costs they perceive in transacting outside their borders. Given that
transaction costs generally increase in distance, if establishments are systematically more
likely to ship a greater distance to same-firm establishments than other-firm establishments
(or equivalently, ship a greater volume internally than externally at any given distance), this
indicates they see a differential cost in transacting within rather than between firms.
Consistent with a large body of evidence drawing on international trade flows (Disdier
and Head, 2008), we find that the elasticity of bilateral trade flows with respect to distance
is slightly less than 1. Newer to the literature and the focus of our study is the estimate
embodied in the same-firm ownership share coefficient. We find values of approximately
2.5 to 3. Interpreting the magnitude of these coefficients requires a short calculation. Our
same-firm ownership metric is the fraction of establishments in downstream zip code z that
are owned by ie ’s firm. Thus the addition of a same-firm establishment in the destination

When computing gzie − g z − g ·ie + g in columns (2) and (5), g z· , g ·ie , and g are simple, unweighted
averages. In columns (3) and (6), we also compute averages but instead weight observations by the observed
flows from the sending establishment multiplied by the observed flows to the destination zip code.

zip code, equivalent to an increase in the same-firm ownership fraction by 0.315, is related
to the same increase in the probability of ie shipping to that zip code as would a 60 percent
reduction in the distance between ie and that zip code.11 The implied “distance premium” of
ownership increases somewhat as we first include (column 2) and then use a weighted version
of (column 3) a multilateral resistance control. The final three columns replace log mileage
with a flexible set of indicators for various distance categories to capture any non-linearities
in distance effects. The same-firm ownership coefficients change little.
In Table 3, we explore how the relative importance of common ownership varies by
distance, the measure of common ownership, and the inclusion of destination fixed effects.
The first column includes an interaction of the same-firm ownership fraction with logged
distance, allowing the relationship between ownership and the probability of shipping to
a location to vary with distance. To help with interpretation, we demean the distance
variable when including interaction term in our specification. The interaction has a positive
coefficient, implying that the link between same-firm presence and the market shares is
stronger for more distant destinations. An additional same-firm downstream establishment
in the destination (again, equivalent to an increase in the same-firm ownership fraction by
0.315) in destinations at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile distances has roughly equivalent
the same impact on trade flows as a reduction in shipping distance by 57 percent, 69 percent,
and 80 percent, respectively. (The main effect of distance is somewhat larger in magnitude
in this specification.)
Columns 2 and 3 use different measures of same-firm presence in the destination zip code.
Column 2 has a binary indicator equal to one if the shipping establishment’s firm owns any
downstream plants in the destination zip code, regardless of the number, while column
3 uses the count of same-firm downstream plants. In both cases, the implied quantitative
For the average ie -z pair, there are 12.9 potential recipients (establishments in industries which are
downstream of ie ) in the destination zip code. The average (across ie -z pairs) of the inverse of one plus the

relationship between common ownership and trade flows is similar to that obtained using our
model-based metric of the same-firm ownership fraction. For instance, column 2 suggests
the average effect of having some same-firm downstream plants in the destination could
provide a distance premium of 75 percent. Column 3 implies that, compared to a zip code
with no same-firm presence, the inclusion of one same-firm downstream establishment in
the destination zip code has approximately the same relationship with trade flows as a 20

the use of the multilateral resistance terms used in our specifications above. The coefficient
estimates are reassuringly similar to that in the benchmark specification.

Notes: For each 6-digit NAICS industry, we regress, as in column (2) of Table 2, the market share
of establishment ie in zip code z against the same-firm ownership fraction hand the logarithm iof the
mileage between ie and z. We compute the distance premium as 1-exp 0.315 · α2 · (α1 )−1 , and
plot the kernel density plot of these distance premia. The bottom five and top five percentiles of
this distribution are not plotted, in accordance with Census disclosure prevention rules.

Interactions with Industry Characteristics

We build on our benchmark analysis by exploring whether there are systematic variations
in the associations among distance, ownership, and transactions. We first re-run our baseline regression (given in the specification of the second column of Table 2) separately for
each of the 6-digit NAICS industries in our sample. Using α1 and α2 to denote the coefficient estimates on the ownership and distance terms respectively, we compute the distance
premium associated with an extra same-firm establishment in the destination zip code as
h

i

“1 − exp 0.315 · α2 · (α1 )−1 ”. We then plot the distribution of these distance premia in Figure 1. This figure indicates that there is substantial heterogeneity across industries in how
distance and ownership are related to shipment flows.
In the remainder of this subsection, we explore the industry characteristics underlying

this heterogeneity. In Figure 2, we plot the coefficient estimates and confidence intervals
of the relationships between distance and our market share variable (left panel) and the
relationships between the same-firm ownership share and the sending establishment’s market
share (right panel) for the 19 broadly-defined industries that comprise our sample.12
Unsurprisingly, industries with the strongest relationship between trade flows and distance produce bulky (and thus costly to ship) products: mining, non-metal manufacturing,
and wood. In addition, trade flows are more responsive to distance in the wholesale sector
than in manufacturing. Industries with the largest estimates of α2 (the coefficient on the
same-firm ownership share) include furniture, printing, and electrical equipment. Conversely,
for the mining, non-metal manufacturing, wood, and wholesale industries, the coefficient estimates of α2 are relatively small. In combination, these estimates suggest that trade flows
respond more heavily to distance for certain perhaps-heavy-to-ship products and respond
more to common ownership in other industries.
Returning to our entire sample of 190 million observations, we interact the key explanatory variables in our specifications (both those allowing the same-firm-ownership relationship
to vary with distance and those not) with several measures of industry attributes. The results
are shown in Table 4. In Panel A, we group industries by the average value-to-weight ratio
of shipments made by industry establishments in our CFS sample. Industries with above
median value-to-weight shipments exhibit a weaker relationship between distance and trade
flows, consistent with our results above. On the other hand, the relationship between trade
flows and firm ownership is stronger for these high value-to-weight commodities. Specifically, the distance premium for above-median value-to-weight commodities is 77 percent

For the most part, these industries are defined at the 3-digit level. However, to maintain sufficiently
large samples sizes to conform with Census disclosure avoidance rules, we combine some 3-digit industries:
Food is the combination of NAICS codes 311 and 312; Clothing is the combination of NAICS codes 313,
314, 315, and 316. And, finally, Wholesale is the combination of NAICS codes 421-429.

and mining establishments). Bernard et al. (2010) and Ahn, Khandelwal, and Wei (2011),
among others, demonstrate that wholesalers have different exporting patterns compared to
manufacturers and play a special role in facilitating international trade. Complementary
to this work, we find that the domestic shipments of wholesalers/mail-order retailers and
manufacturers/mining establishments differ as well. First, the shipments of distributors are
more sensitive to distance, consistent with Hillberry and Hummels’s (2003) characterization
of manufacturers and wholesalers belonging to a hub-and-spoke arrangement.13 Moreover,
the relationship between shipment intensity and common ownership is weaker for distributors (see the “Interaction btw. same-firm ownership fraction and indicator for distributors”
term). Comparing the two effects, the distance premium for distributors for median-distance
ie −z pairs is 46 percent for distributors and 70 percent for establishments in other industries.
In the remaining panels of Table 4, our industry-level variables are measured only for the
manufacturing sector, meaning we will be examining the interactions of observable characteristics within the subset of establishments with the latter 70 percent distance premium.
In Panel C, we apply Rauch’s (1999) classification to check whether common ownership plays a larger role in facilitating physical input flows for goods more likely to involve
relationship-specific investments. Rauch classifies manufactured products into three classes,
in ascending order of relationship specificity: products that are traded on an organized exchange; those that are not traded in an organized market, but are reference priced in trade
publications; and those which are neither exchange traded nor reference priced. We find that
for the most differentiated products—those in the last of the three categories—the slope of
the relationship between market shares and the same-firm ownership fraction is significantly
larger than it is for reference-priced commodities or exchange-traded commodities. The
distance premium for these differentiated products is 75 percent, while it is 59 percent for
reference-priced products, and 61 percent for exchange-traded products.14 While there is lit13

According to Hillberry and Hummels, in this hub-and-spoke configuration “[g]oods are manufactured in
the hub and dispersed, sometimes at great distances, to a number of wholesaling spokes spread throughout
the country. The wholesaling spokes then distribute, over very short distances, to retailers.” (p. 1090)

In computing these premia, note that within the Panel C subsample an additional same-firm establish-

tle difference in the distance premium between reference-priced and exchange-traded goods,
the larger value for differentiated products is consistent with Monteverde and Teece (1982),
Masten (1984), and Masten, Meehan, and Snyder (1989, 1991), who posit that the potential
for costly hold up between an input supplier and input customer will tend to be larger for
products that are complex or specific to the customer-supplier relationship.
In Panels D and E we consider industries’ use of new technologies. In Panel D, we
group industries based on the ratio of their investment in information technology to their
total value of shipments. The results in column (9) of Table 4 indicate a distance premium
for industries with above-median IT intensities of 81 percent, compared to 66 percent for
below-median industries. In Panel E, we group industries based on the fraction of their
sales conducted through the internet. Industries with above-median e-commerce shares have
a distance premium of 77 percent, as opposed to a 64 percent distance premium for low
e-commerce industries. These results complement recent work by Fort (2017) and Forman
and McElheran (2017), which tie the arrival of new information technologies to a decline in
production fragmentation. In our setup, this would correspond to a decline in the average
same-firm ownership fraction, with larger declines occurring in more IT intensive industries.
Here, we find that the relationship between the volume of shipments and common ownership
is stronger for IT intensive industries for a given configuration of establishments across firms
and locations.
Finally, in the international setting, Antràs (2003, 2005) demonstrates that intra-firm
shipments are more prevalent in industries with a higher capital intensity, and in countries
with higher capital-labor ratios. Motivated by these results, Panel F compares the relationships between shipment intensity, common ownership, and distance by the capital intensity
(dollar value of capital stock per employee) of an industry. The distance premia for abovemedian and below-median capital intensity industries are respectively 68 percent and 77
percent. It is unclear that capital intensity has much bearing on the relative importance

the benchmark sample in Panels A and B.

Quasi-exogenous Changes in Common Ownership

Up to this point, we have refrained from lending a causal interpretation to our regression
estimates. Location and ownership choices could well be endogenous to expected shipment
destinations.15 Recognizing this, we seek to identify the causal effect of ownership on shipment patterns by using instances where firms acquire establishments for reasons other than
the favorability or lack thereof of those establishments’ locations viz-a-viz their expected
shipments. Namely, we look at cases where new within-firm vertical links are created when
a subset of establishments experiences an ownership change that is incidental to a large
multi-establishment acquisition by its new parent firm. The logic of this approach is that
when two multi-industry firms merge, or when a multi-industry firm purchases multiple establishments from another firm, it is unlikely that those establishments in the merging firms’
secondary and tertiary lines of business triggered the acquisition. As a result, the locations
of these peripheral establishments relative to other establishments in the acquiring firm are
plausibly exogenous. The identifying assumption is that the acquiring firm’s motivation for
the merger was to acquire the establishments in the acquired firm’s primary lines of business,
not so that it could own a peripheral establishment.16
To give an example, consider an establishment that produces hardwood flooring and
is initially owned by a firm whose primary business segments are in products other than
hardwood flooring. If this firm is then acquired by another whose primary segments are
also not involved in the supply of flooring, then it is likely that its acquisition of the flooring
establishment is incidental to the broader merger. That establishment was essentially “along
15

Firms might also spatially cluster their establishments for other reasons. For instance, Giroud (2013) and
Klanins and Lafontaine (2013) demonstrate that proximity allows a firm’s headquarters to monitor and acquire information from the firm’s other establishments, thereby increasing those establishments’ productivity
and, in turn, profitability.
16
Hastings and Gilbert (2005) and Hortaçsu and Syverson (2007) use a related strategy of exploiting withinfirm, cross-market variation following a multiple-market merger to identify the effect of firm boundaries. In
these earlier papers, the dependent variable of interest was the downstream market price rather than the
propensity to ship to a given location, as is the focus here.

29

for the ride” in the merger. The acquiring firm now has an additional establishment to ship
to or from whose distance to other establishments in the firm was unlikely to be endogenously
determined.
We implement this strategy as follows. From the set of establishments that were part of
a merger or acquisition between 2002 and 2007, we define our subset of “incidental merger”
establishments by identifying establishments which satisfy the following criteria: a) both the
acquired firm and the acquiring firm contain at least three segments, where a segment is
defined by 4-digit NAICS code, and b) the establishment’s sector is in neither of the premerger firms’ top S segments. Among the 35,000 establishments in our benchmark sample,
2400 satisfy criteria (a) and (b) when S equals 1 (i.e., 2400 establishments were acquired and
did not belong to either the acquiring or the acquired firm’s top segment), and 1100 satisfy
criteria (a) and (b) for S equal to 3.17
After identifying the incidental mergers in the sample, we construct an instrumental
variable for our same-firm ownership fraction. For each ie −z pair, for an establishment ie that
changes ownership because of an incidental merger, we count the number of establishments
in z (belonging to an industry which is downstream of ie ) which were part of a different firm
from ie before the merger, and part of the same firm as ie after the merger. Our instrument
takes this count and then divides by the number of total plants in z which are downstream
of ie .18 For establishments ie which did not change ownership due to an incidental merger,
our instrument is equal to zero.
Because of our large sample size and nonlinear gravity specification, we implement the
estimation using a two-stage control-function based estimator. In the first stage, we use a
linear regression to regress our endogenous same-firm ownership fraction on the instrumental variable along with log mileage and sending-establishment fixed effects.19 The residual
17

Additional details on the construction of our incidental merger sample are provided in Appendix B.
With S equal to 1, there are 14,400 sending establishment-destination zip code pairs for which our
instrumental variable is greater than zero. With S equal to 2, the number of observations for which our
instrument is greater than zero decreases to 8900. With S equal to 3, this same figure falls to 5300.
19
Our estimation falls within the class of panel count data models with multiplicative fixed effects (in
our context, one for each establishment in our sample) and endogenous explanatory variables. Since the

Notes: All regressions include sending-establishment fixed effects. The first-stage regressions also
include log mileage as a covariate. The sample includes 189.6 million ie -z pairs, drawing on the
shipments made by 35,000 establishments. In the final row, “Number of segments” refers to the S we
used when identifying which establishments were part of an incidental merger. In all specifications,
we calculate the unweighted multilateral resistance terms. The last column reports our baseline
results (column 2 from Table 2) without attempting to address potential endogeneity in the samefirm ownership fraction variable.

from this regression is then included as an additional covariate in a second-stage regression,
which is a fixed effect Poisson model as before. In Appendix D, we discuss the underlying
assumptions needed for consistent estimates and report the results from our Monte Carlo
study on our approach.
The first three columns of Table 5 presents the output of this exercise. Here, the coefficient
estimate of the same-firm ownership fraction is approximately one-third smaller than the
estimates in Table 2. (On the other hand, the estimates related to the importance of distance
are as before). Now, increasing the same-firm ownership fraction in the destination zip code
by 0.315 (corresponding to adding a single common ownership establishment there) has the
same impact on trade flows as decreasing the distance between origin and destination by 40
endogenous common ownership share variable is restricted to lie between zero and one, we would ideally
apply a maximum likelihood estimation procedure. However, this is computationally infeasible given our
large sample size, necessitating using ordinary least squares for the first stage.

Sensitivity Analysis

In Appendix C, we perform four exercises to explore the sensitivity of the results in this
section. We first verify that our main results are robust to our choice of cutoff when defining
which pairs of industries are vertically related to one another. We then argue that the
distance premium of common ownership is the same for establishments belonging to small
versus large firms. Third, for the set of establishments which are surveyed in both the 2002
and 2007 Commodity Flow Survey, we demonstrate that our assessed distance premium is
robust to the inclusion of past shipment behavior in our estimating equations. And finally,
as an alternative to the control function approach we apply a GMM procedure — due to
Woolridge (1997) and Windmeijer (2000) — to estimate the relationship between trade flows,
common ownership, and distance. Here, both the coefficient estimates and the standard
errors are somewhat larger than those in Table 5.

Aggregate Effects

In this section, we apply our estimates on the prevalence of intra-firm shipments and the
relationships among shipment intensity, common ownership, and distance to quantify the
aggregate importance of common ownership. To perform these counterfactual exercises, we
employ the models of Caliendo and Parro (2015) and Caliendo et al. (2016). An extended
and aggregated version of the model we have laid out in Section 2, these models incorporate
input-output linkages across sectors, multiple primary inputs, and (in the case of Caliendo
et al., 2016) labor mobility across regions.
To summarize the Caliendo et al. (2016) model, each region has an initial stock of land
and structures. In Caliendo et al. (2016), each region is one of 50 U.S. States. In our
analysis here, closer to the geographic definition used in the earlier parts of this paper, an
32

individual region represents a either a single MSA (Metropolitan Statistical Area) or a state’s
non-metropolitan portion.20 Consumers within each region work and consume a bundle of
consumption goods produced by different industries. Their preferences are described by
a Cobb-Douglas utility function over the goods and services consumed of each industry’s
commodity. Within each region-industry pair, a continuum of intermediate input producers
combine (via a Cobb-Douglas production function) land and structures, labor, and material
inputs to make output. Establishments compete as a function of their own idiosyncratic
productivity and the average productivity of the establishments in their region-industry to
sell to the final good producer, who resides within each destination market; the intermediategood-supplying establishment that is able to deliver the good at the lowest price serves the
destination. This aspect of the model corresponds to the partial equilibrium model discussed
in Section 2. Also within each industry and region, final goods producers make a regionindustry-specific bundle by combining the goods that they have purchased from intermediate
input suppliers. In Appendix E, we delineate the maximization problems faced by consumers,
intermediate input producers, and final goods producers. We spell out the market clearing
conditions, define the model’s equilibrium, and discuss the model’s solution. Much of the
material in that appendix can be found, in much greater detail, in Caliendo and Parro (2015)
and Caliendo et al. (2016).21
20

There are two reasons why we apply a geographic classification based on MSAs rather than zip codes.
First, some of the required regional data on employees’ compensation or total gross output do not exist at
the finer level. Second, in computing the counterfactual equilibrium, we must repeatedly solve a system
of (linear) equations of dimension equal to the Z · J, the number of regions multiplied by the number
of industries. This would be computationally challenging, to say the least, with the finer zip-code-based
geographic classification.
21
There is one meaningful way in which the Caliendo et al. model—and, consequently, the model used in
this section—does not nest the Eaton, Kortum, and Sotelo (2012)-based model introduced in Section 2: In
this section, we revert to the more conventional representation of establishments as points on a continuum.
As a result, when computing counterfactual responses to changes in trade costs, the entire response will occur
through the intensive margin: A decline in trade costs will not result in pairs of regions to go from having
zero to positive trade flows. For the goal of this section—computing the welfare effects of counterfactual
changes in trade costs—the representation of firms as points on a continuum is a reasonable approximation.
In one of their counterfactual exercises, using a single-sector model, Eaton, Kortum, and Sotelo examine
the change in international trade flows which would result from a uniform 10 percent reduction in crossborder trade costs. They report that ... “World exports rise by 43 percent due to lower trade costs, in
line with results in Eaton, Kortum, and Kramarz (2011)... nearly all of this increased trade occurs within
pairs of countries that were already trading, 99.9984 percent.” (p. 365) On the other hand, when examining

33

We focus here on the model’s calibration. Beyond the aforementioned data on same-firm
ownership shares, distance measures, and shipment rates, this exercise requires data parameterizing consumers’ preferences for different final consumption goods, industries’ production
functions, regions’ initial labor and capital endowments, and the dispersion in establishments’ fundamental productivity. For these parameters we follow, as much as possible, the
calibration procedure outlined in Caliendo et al. (2016). We adopt an industry classification
scheme with 19 tradable and 10 non-tradable industries.22 For this set of industry definitions
and for our more coarsely defined regions, we re-compute trade flows and same-firm ownership shares from the 2007 Commodity Flow Survey. Data from the 2007 BEA Input-Output
Table identify parameters related to sectoral production functions and the representative
consumer’s final preferences: We set γ jk —which is the Cobb-Douglas share parameter that
describes the importance of industry k’s commodity as an input for production in sector
j—equal to the share of industry j’s expenditures that are spent on purchases of commodity
k, and we let γ j (the share of capital and labor in production) equal the residual share of
industry j’s expenditures. The preference parameter for industry j’s output, ξ j , is proportional to the industry’s final consumption expenditures. The initial labor endowment, Li ,
equals MSA i’s total employment as a share of aggregate employment. (These employment
figures are taken from the BEA Regional Accounts. The total labor endowment, L, is nortrade across MSAs (instead of countries) separately by industry (instead of aggregating across industries),
the extensive margin will likely play a larger role than in Eaton, Kortum, and Sotelo’s experiment.
In addition, one can rationalize the difference in formulations—a continuum of establishments in this
section as opposed to a countable number in Section 2—as in Gaubert and Itskhoki (2016). Gaubert and
Itskhoki propose a model in which each industry has a small number of firms (since they are interested in
the extent to which individual firms can explain countries’ comparative advantage), but with a continuum
of industries. In this section, in line with Caliendo and Parro (2015) and Caliendo et al. (2016), we apply a
coarser industry definition compared to what we use in Section 2. So, one may think of the sectors in this
section as a collection of more finely defined industries which formed the basis of our Section 2 model.
22
The tradable industries are Food, Beverages, and Tobacco; Textiles; Apparel and Leather; Paper Products; Printing; Petroleum and Coal Products; Chemical Products; Rubber and Plastic Products; Wood
Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Primary Metals; Fabricated Metal Products; Machinery; Computer and Electronic Products; Electrical Equipment; Transportation Equipment; Furniture; Miscellaneous
Manufacturing; and Wholesaling. The non-tradable industries are Farms, Forestry, and Fishing; Mining and
Utilities; Construction; Retail; Transportation Services; Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate; Information,
and Professional, Business, and Other Services; Health and Education; Arts, Amusement, Accommodation,
and Food Services; and Government.

following the procedure of Caliendo et al. (2016).23 Our estimates of θj , which parameterize
the dispersion of establishments’ idiosyncratic productivity, are taken from Caliendo and
Parro (2015).24

where α1 = 0.95 and α2 = −1.80 equal the values given in the second column of Table 5.
Table 6 presents the results from our counterfactual exercises for κ ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} .
These exercises correspond to the elimination of common ownership (κ = 0), the status
quo (κ = 1), or a 2-, 3-, 4-, or 5-fold increase in the share of same-firm establishments in
destination zip codes.
An increase trade costs due to the elimination of common ownership, the κ = 0 case, leads
to a modest 0.2 percent decrease in real wages and a 0.1 percent drop in gross output. Given
the small same-firm ownership fraction present in the data (a reduction from 0.05 percent
to 0), these aggregate effects are nontrivial. There are two reasons behind this multiplier
effect. First, common ownership tends to be prevalent for destination-origin pairs which are
close to one another—pairs over which many shipments already occur. Second, increases
in trade costs propagate (via input output linkages) throughout all industries, not only the
manufacturing and wholesale industries which experience the initial decrease in productivity.
Moreover, it is likely these values are lower bound estimates of the trade volume effect of
23

That is, we begin by computing 1 − β̃i as the share of total compensation in MSA i that is paid to labor.
Since the non-labor compensation equals not only payments to land and structures, but also equipment
rentals, we calculate the share of land and structures as βi = β̃−0.17
0.83 , where the value 0.17 reflects payments
to equipment.

eliminating common ownership, because our counterfactual calculation imposes the marginal
trade effects from our estimates onto inframarginal ownership links. It is likely that the most
trade-enhancing links in the economy have effects on shipment volumes considerably larger
than that implied by the magnitude of our esitmates.
In the subsequent rows, we compute the welfare and gross output changes which would
occur if common ownership shares in destination MSAs were progressively larger. When
the same-firm ownership share is five times its current value (κ = 5), the most tradeenhancing case, welfare increases by 1.2 percent and gross output by 5.6 percent relative
to the initial allocation. Comparing across the κ ∈ {2, 3, 4, 5} cases indicates the marginal
welfare gains due to the reduction in transaction costs from increasing common ownership
grow non-linearly. (At the same time the marginal/inframarginal differential noted in the
κ = 0 discussion above implies the estimates for the cases with greater common ownership
are upper bounds.) In columns 3 and 4, corresponding of Caliendo and Parro (2015), we
consider an alternate specification in which labor is immobile across regions and the share
of structures and land in production equals 0. Here, counterfactual changes in welfare and
gross trade flows are somewhat smaller.
To sum up, our counterfactual exercises imply that increasing levels of vertical integration
would lead to both higher trade flows and higher welfare. Together with the results given in
the previous subsection, Table 6 indicates that the shadow benefit of conducting transactions
within the firm are sizable not only at the individual transaction level, but also represent a
sizable catalyst to trade at the aggregate level.
We want to emphasize that this exercise is only meant to assess the aggregate implications
of across-establishment trade costs, one of the several channels through which firm ownership
patterns affect consumer welfare. We argue in our earlier work that the private benefits of
vertical integration are not primarily motivated by easing the flows of physical inputs along
production chains. Thus it is likely that the figures in Table 6 understate the welfare effects
of vertical integration. On the other hand, in our application of Caliendo et al. (2016)’s

perfect-competition-based framework, we did not attempt to assess the affect of changing
ownership patterns on markups or product availability. It is certainly possible that, through
market foreclosure and other anti-competitive practices, increased vertical integration may
lead to lower trade flows and consumer welfare compared to what we report in Table 6.
Thus the counterfactual exercises in this section are only a first step, albeit an important
one, towards measuring the aggregate effects of alternate ownership patterns.

Conclusion

Establishments are substantially more likely to ship to destinations that are i) close by and
ii) contain downstream establishments which share ownership with the sender. In this paper,
we have used data on shipments made by tens of thousands of establishments throughout
the manufacturing and wholesale sectors of the U.S. to characterize the relationships between transaction volume, distance, and common ownership. We find that, all else equal,
firms send internal shipments further (or equivalently, have a greater propensity to make
internal shipments any given distance). The magnitude of this differential willingness to
ship implies that the shadow benefit of internal transactions is substantial: an extra same37

firm downstream establishment in the destination zip code has roughly the same effect on
transaction volumes as a 40 percent reduction in distance. Moreover, a simple multi-sector
general equilibrium trade model suggests that there is a notable reduction in trade costs
from even the relatively modest amount of common ownership in the economy. Aggregate
welfare would be approximately 0.2 percent lower in a counterfactual environment without
the trade-enhancing effect of common ownership.
Quantifying the magnitude and aggregate effects of other benefits associated with common ownership—beyond the elusion of transaction costs—is an exciting topic for future
research. In an earlier paper (Atalay et al., 2014), we argued that the primary motivation
for common ownership of production chains is to share intangible inputs across establishments, with the mitigation of transaction costs as a secondary concern. However, due to data
limitations, we could only provide circumstantial evidence in favor of the intangible input
hypothesis.25 Now, thanks to new survey being collected and linked to Census micro data
(Bloom et al., 2014, and Buffington et al., 2017), it is possible to directly quantify the extent
to which profitability-increasing management practices respond to changes in firm boundaries, and thus should also be possible to evaluate aggregate productivity in counterfactual
environments in which firms’ sharing of intangible managerial inputs is muted.

Calculations Related to Section 2

The goal of this appendix is to relate Equations 2 and 3. Begin with πzie , the fraction of shipments to zip code z which come from establishment ie . As a reminder, to emphasize, these
calculations refer to share of sales of a given product in zip code z that come from different
sending establishments. As in Section 2, we omit commodity or industry superscripts.

Above, the second line follows from the definitions of Φz and Φzie , while the second

destination zip code that share ownership with the sender). Next, we apply the definition of

close, but not equal, to 1. The Φze ,ie term roughly gives the “expected” trade flows from
establishment code ie to establishment z e . This expectation varies non-linearly with a) the
distance between establishment ie and establishment z e , and with b) the distance interacted
44

with an indicator for a within-firm relationship. The approximation comes about because
the average (over all plants, z e , that are located in zip code z) of the expectation is not equal
to the expectation of the average of the distance, or the distance by same-firm indicator
variables. In the original Eaton, Kortum, and Sotelo formulation, the only variables that
shape i-to-z expected trade flows are the same for all destination zip code establishments
(as there is no same-firm indicator which could vary across establishments within a destination zip code). As a result, in Eaton, Kortum, and Sotelo (2012) there is no need for an
approximation. In our context, the approximation error should be small.
Moving forward, we apply the definition of πze ie , and then use Equation 1 to substitute
out the πze ie terms:

πzie ≈

The final expression is equivalent to Equation 3.

Identifying Incidental Mergers

This section aims to explain both the data and sample generation in more detail. We use the
Longitudinal Business Database from the Census Bureau to identify mergers, and incidental
mergers, that occurred between 2002 and 2007. A merger in year t is identified when a plant
which has its firm identifier switch from year t to year t+1, which has the firm identifier
from year t+1 to year t+2, which switches to a firm identifier that was already present in
the market as of year t.
45

We then compute the total number of plants which change ownership between the
acquiring-acquired firm pair in each merger year. From this set of establishments which participated in a merger, we classify acquired establishments which change hands as part of an
incidental merger using the following procedure. First, among plants in multi-establishment
transactions, we exclude (from our set of incidental merger establishments) plants whose
acquiring firm or acquired firm had fewer than three business segments (a segment referring
to a set of establishments belonging to a 4-digit NAICS industry). We rank these business
segments by payroll for each firm. From the establishments retained from the previous step
our sample of incidental merger establishments are those which are not in either the acquiring
or acquired firm’s top S segments.
Figure 3 illustrates these criteria for a hypothetical merger between two firms. Within
this figure, there are two firms, where each firm has multiple establishments across multiple
business segments. Each symbol represents a separate establishment in one of seven possible segments: Automotive Transportation, Airplane Manufacturing, Bicycle Manufacturing,
Ship Manufacturing, Tire Manufacturing, Electric Lighting Manufacturing, and Computer
Manufacturing. Before the merger, the three segments for Firm 1 are Automotive Transportation, Airplane Manufacturing, and Bicycle Manufacturing. For Firm 2, the top segments are Automotive Manufacturing, Tires, and Airplane Manufacturing. Since both firms
have multiple establishments in more than three segments, a merger of the two firms would
satisfy the first two criteria of the previous paragraph. Depending on the chosen value of
S, the number of plants classified as “incidental” to the merger would vary. With S=1, all
establishments outside of Automotive Manufacturing would be classified as incidental merger
plants. For S=3, Shipbuilding, Electric Lighting, and Computer manufacturers would be
classified as incidental to the merger.

46

Figure 3: Incidental Merger Example

Notes: Firms 1 and 2 have multiple segments, with each segment potentially containing multiple
establishments. Each establishment is represented by an individual symbol (e.g., with a car representing an Automotive plant; a plane representing an Airplane Manufacturer). The three dashed
circles, for S ∈ {1, 2, 3}, enclose the establishments which are excluded from the set of incidental
merger establishments.

C

Additional Robustness Checks

In this section, we discuss four robustness checks, aimed at examining the sensitivity of
the Section 4 results to alternate sample construction and estimation methods, and to the
inclusion of past shipment data in our regressions.
In our benchmark regression, we restrict our sample to establishments belonging to multiunit firms. We apply this restriction because establishments belonging to single-unit firms
mechanically cannot possibly sell to another establishment in their firm (as no such establishment exists). However, even in our restricted sample, a establishment belonging to a
two-establishment firm will only have a positive same-firm ownership fraction in one destination zip code, with zeros elsewhere. To see whether most of our observations are drawn
from relatively small firms like these, or if the relationship between trade flows and our samefirm ownership fraction varies with firm size (the number of establishments belonging to ie ’s
firm), we re-estimate the regression from column (2) of Table 2 only using observations from
large firms. In columns (2) through (4) of Table 7, we progressively restrict the sample to

Notes: The first column reiterates column (2) of Table 2. Relative to the first column, in columns
(2) through (4), we vary the sample according to the size of the firm of the sending establishment.
In columns (5) and (6), we vary the cutt-off share of (6-digit NAICS) industry I’s revenues that
must go to industry J for the I,J industry pair to be defined as vertically linked. The sample size
in columns (1), (5), and (6) are 189.6 million ie − z pairs, representing the shipments of 35,000
establishments. In columns (2), (3), and (4), the sample sizes are 149 million, 125 million, and 103
million, respectively, representing the shipments made by 27,000, 23,000, and 18,000 establishments.
In all specifications, we calculate the unweighted multilateral resistance terms.

sending establishments belonging to 5-establishment, 10-establishment, or 20-establishment
firms. The estimated coefficients across the first four columns are similar to one another.
Second, in constructing the samples in any of our regression specifications, a key step
is to define pairs of industries which are upstream/downstream of one another. This step
is necessary to construct the same-firm ownership fraction,szie . Under a definition in which
many pairs of industries are classified to be vertically linked, the number of downstream
establishments for a sending establishment ie will be relatively high. As a result, the samefirm ownership fraction (which computes the fraction of downstream establishments in the
destination zip code that belong to the same firm asie ) will tend to be relatively large.26
In the final two columns of Table 7, we consider increasingly restrictive definitions. In
these latter two columns, the estimated coefficient on the log mileage term is similar to
the estimate of the benchmark specification. The coefficient estimates for the same-firm
26

In this fraction, both the numerator and the denominator will be smaller. However, with a definition in
which many pairs of industries that are classified as vertically integrated, the denominator decreases more
than the numerator does.

Notes: All regressions include sending-establishment fixed effects. The first-stage regressions in
columns (3) through (6) also include log mileage as a covariate. The sample includes 43 million
ie -z pairs, drawing on the shipments made by 9,000 establishments who are included in both the
2002 and 2007 versions of the Commodity Flow Survey. In the final row, “Number of segments”
refers to the S we used when identifying which establishments were part of an incidental merger.
In all specifications, we calculate the unweighted multilateral resistance terms.

ownership fraction term is smaller by approximately one-third. However, since the number
of downstream establishments (with the more restrictive definition of vertical linkages) is
lower, the resulting distance premium in the specifications in the last two columns are 69
percent and 73 percent, somewhat larger than the 60 percent of the benchmark specification.
Third, establishments’ shipment decisions are persistent. Establishments which ship to a
location in a given year are, all else equal, substantially more likely to ship to that location
in subsequent years. In our Section 4 analysis, we excluded past shipment information as
a potential covariate, primarily because the set of establishments which are surveyed by
the Census changes from one edition to the next, meaning that including past shipment
information as an explanatory variable reduces the sample size considerably. In Table 8, we
include

Xzie
Xz

from the 2002 Commodity Flow Survey as an additional regressor, using as a
49

sample the set of establishments who were surveyed in both the 2002 and 2007 versions of
the Commodity Flow Survey. The first two columns conduct a Poisson regression, without
attempting to account for the endogeneity of the same-firm ownership fraction. Across these
first two columns, the distance premium of an additional same-firm establishment is similar,
around 60 percent in both columns. In columns (3) through (6), we conduct our control
function estimates. Here, too, the relative magnitudes on the coefficients on the log mileage
and the same-firm ownership fraction variables are unaffected by the inclusion of previous
shipment behavior.
Finally, as an alternative to the control function approach, Woolridge (1997) and Windmeijer (2000) derive the moment conditions for cases with a linear first stage and a fixed
effect Poisson second stage. We apply these moment conditions and re-estimate the relationships between trade flows, distance, and common onwership. The estimates are given Table
9, with each column applying a different definition of incidental merger establishments. The
coefficients on the same-firm ownership fraction are now larger than the benchmark Poisson
regression estimates, though with substantially larger standard errors. It’s because of the
larger uncertainty surrounding the GMM estimates that we take the coefficient estimates
from our two-stage control function approach to be our headline results.

D

Control Function and GMM Approaches

We explore the control function and GMM approaches which we use in Section 4.3. In
particular, we specify our GMM moments conditions and perform a Monte Carlo exercise
to assess the performance of our control function and GMM estimators. For this appendix
only, let πzie be our dependent variable; dzie an explanatory variable; szie an endogenous
explanatory variable; ie the index of a sending establishment, an z the index of a destination
zip code. There are a large number of sending establishments, but a fixed sets of locations
Z.

Notes: All regressions include sending-establishment fixed effects. The first-stage regressions also
include log mileage as a covariate. The sample includes 189.6 million ie -z pairs, drawing on the
shipments made by 35,000 establishments. In the final row, “Number of segments” refers to the S we
used when identifying which establishments were part of an incidental merger. In all specifications,
we calculate the unweighted multilateral resistance terms. The last column reports our baseline
results (column 2 from Table 2) without attempting to address potential endogeneity in the samefirm ownership fraction variable.

Consider the following data generating process, a fixed effect Poisson model with endogenous regressor:

πzie ∼ P oisson(exp(szie β + dzie γ + vie + zie ))
szie = dzie α + xzie σ + ηie + ξzie
zie = ξzie ρ + φzie
In the final equation φzie is independent of ξzie . Also, E[exp(φzie )] = 1. We also assume
that zie is uncorrelated with z0 ie for z 6= z 0 and that E[exp(zie )] = 1. Finally, let xzie denote
our instrument for szie . With endogeneity, Cov(szie , zie ) 6= 0, but Cov(xzie , zie ) = 0.
Our GMM estimator is due to Woolridge (1997) and Windmeijer (2000). Our moment

Details of the Section 5 Model

In this section, we spell out the model that we use in Section 5 to quantify the aggregate
effects of trade-inhibiting transaction costs. We first describe the maximization problems
53

faced by each region’s representative consumer, each region-industry’s intermediate good
producing firm, and each region-industry’s final good producing firm. We then present the
market-clearing conditions, and define the competitive equilibrium. Finally, we outline the
algorithm with which one can compute the counterfactual equilibrium. To emphasize, these
models were originally introduced in Caliendo and Parro (2015) and Caliendo et al. (2016).
Each region is home to a representative consumer, who inelastically supplies labor and
has Cobb-Douglas preferences over the goods produced by each industry:

Ui =

J
Y

j

(cji )ξ where

j=1

J
X

ξ j = 1.

j=1

These preference parameters are identical across regions. Using Pij to refer to the price
of final good j in region i, and Ii =

ri Hi +wi Li
Li

as the per capita income of households in region

i, the indirect utility of households in region i equals
J
Y
Ii
Pij
Ui = ; and where Pi ≡
Pi
ξj
j=1

!ξ j

equals the ideal price index in region i.
Within each region and industry, a continuum of intermediate-good-producing establishments produce using a combination of materials, structures and land, and labor. Individual
establishments have idiosyncratic productivity levels, vij , with the levels drawn from a Frechet
distribution with parameter θj . The production function for the set of establishments in region i and industry j with productivity draw vij is given by

In this equation, the input choices hji (·), lij (·), and Mijk (·) of establishments in region i
are functions of their idiosyncratic productivity levels. Each establishment in region i rents

54

structures at (constant) unit price ri , hires labor at constant unit price wi , and purchases
material inputs at constant unit prices Pik (for k ∈ 1, 2, ..., J). Assuming production functions
exhibit constant returns to scale (so that γ j +

For each region and industry, there is a perfectly competitive industry of final goods
producers, who combine the output of intermediate input producers purchased from the
continua of establishments from different supplying regions, according to the following production function:

Here, q̃ij (vij ) equals the intermediate goods purchased from producers that have idiosyncratic productivity vij , φj (v j ) denotes the joint density function of the idiosyncratic productivity levels of the producers from the Z possible origin regions, and ςij equals the elasticity
of substitution across intermediate good varieties. The purpose of introducing these final
goods producers is to cleanly characterize the price of an industry’s output in each region.
This price equals the final good producers’ marginal cost:

As in Section 2, each final good producer purchases from the intermediate good supplier
that is able to supply the good at the lowest price. Because competition across intermediate
good suppliers is perfectly competitive, the price paid by the intermediate good user equals
the supplier’s marginal cost multiplied by the cost of transporting the good from the supplier

A simplification we make, here, is to impose balanced trade across regions. As Caliendo et al. (2016)
document, in reality, within the United States trade imbalance is prevalent. Certain regions—such as Indiana
and Wisconsin—run substantial trade surpluses, while others—including Florida and Georgia–have large
trade deficits. To rationalize these trade imbalances, Caliendo et al. (2016) assume that, while some fraction
of a state’s land and structures are owned locally, the remainder are owned nationally. States with a deficit
are able to finance their consumption because they own a relatively large share of the national portfolio of
structures. To match the trade imbalances, then, Caliendo et al. define state total income (which will equal

One of the key differences between Caliendo and Parro (2015) and Caliendo et al.
(2016)—the two papers upon which we build—relates to the treatment of primary inputs.
In Caliendo et al. (2016), consumers are allowed to costlessly migrate across regions. As a
result, utility is equalized across regions: Ui =

Ii
Pi

= U for all i. Differently, in Caliendo and

Parro (2015) labor is completely immobile. There is some initial exogenously given allocation
of labor across regions, which does not respond to changes in trade costs or technology. Also
in Caliendo and Parro (2015), labor is the sole primary factor of production: βi = 0. Below,
we will apply these two alternate, diametrically opposed specifications for our counterfactual
exercises.
Having specified the consumers’ and producers’ maximization problems and the marketclearing conditions, we now define a competitive equilibrium. This definition is taken almost
directly from Caliendo et al. (2016): Given factor supplies, L and Hi , a competitive equilibrium for this economy is given by a set of factor prices in each region {ri , wi } ; a set of labor
allocations, structure and land allocations, final good expenditures, consumption of final
n

goods per person, and final goods prices Lji , Hij , Xij , cji , Pij

for each industry and region;

a set of pairwise sectoral material use in every region Mijk ; and pairwise regional intermej
diate expenditure shares in every sector, πzi
; such that i) the optimization conditions for

consumers and intermediate and final goods producers hold; all markets clear (Equation 1214); ii) aggregate trade is balanced (Equation 15); iii) and utility is equalized across regions.
Condition iii) is omitted in the specification with immobile labor.
total final consumption expenditures) to be equal to the sum of the state’s trade imbalances (as recorded
in the Commodity Flow Survey) and the state’s value added (as recorded by the BEA). With our finer
definition of areas, this procedure unfortunately results in negative income for certain MSAs (principally
those which send large volumes of refined petroleum to other areas, such as Lake Charles, Louisiana). So,
instead, we assume that all structures and land are owned locally and, correspondingly and counterfactually,
that trade across regions is balanced.

Next, we outline the algorithm presented in Caliendo and Parro (2015) and Caliendo
et al. (2016) to compute the change in equilibrium trade flows and aggregate welfare in
response to a change in trade costs. As in those earlier papers, we will use Y 0 to refer to
the counterfactual value of an arbitrary variable Y , and Yb =

Y0
Y

to refer to the change in

variable Y .

the primary input unit price and ω̂= (ω̂1 , ...ω̂Z ) the

vector of changes in the primary input prices.
• Step 2: Given this guess for the primary input bundles’ cost changes, compute the
changes in the costs of each industry-region’s input cost bundles, and the final good
prices in each industry-region using Equations 9 and 11:

• Step 4: Labor mobility condition:
In the specification with immobile labor, L̂i = 1 for all regions i. If, instead, we follow
the Caliendo et al. (2016) algorithm, changes in the labor force of each region are given
by:

This equation states that shipments of commodity j can either be consumed (the first
summand on the right hand side) or used as a material input (the second summand).28
To update our initial guess of costs for the primary input bundle, we need one additional
market clearing condition. Caliendo and Parro (2015) and Caliendo et al. (2016) use different
market clearing conditions.

This condition states that the payments to region z’s structures/land and labor after
the change in trade costs (given on the left-hand side) equal the value of the shipments
sent to all other regions (given on the right-hand side).
Since the trade shares (the πs), changes in each region’s labor force (the Ls), and the
shipments of different commodities from different regions (the Xs) are each functions
of the ω̂ vector, failure of Equation 16 or 17 imply that our guess of ω̂ needs to be
updated.

The algorithm follows steps 2-6 until Equation 16 holds (when working through the case with
immobile labor) or Equation 17 holds (when working through the case with mobile labor).
