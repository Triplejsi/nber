ABSTRACT
We assess how the African slave trade—which had enduring effects on social cohesion—
continues to influence financial systems. After showing that the intensity with which people were
enslaved and exported from Africa during the 1400 – 1900 period helps account for overall
financial development, household access to credit, and firm access to finance, we evaluate three
potential mechanisms linking the slave trade to modern finance—information sharing institutions,
trust in financial institutions, and the quality of legal institutions. We discover that the slave trade
is strongly, negatively related to the information sharing and trust mechanisms but not to the legal
mechanism.

1. INTRODUCTION
Given the importance of finance for economic growth, an active body of research
examines the historical determinants of financial development. 1 Many researchers focus on
European colonization. La Porta, et al. (1997, 1998, 2008) show that as European countries
colonized much of the world, they spread distinct legal systems that continue to influence
investor protection laws and financial development. Engerman and Sokoloff (1997) and
Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001) stress that European colonizers created different,
persistent political institutions that have had enduring effects on financial development (Beck,
Demirgüç-Kunt, and Levine 2003). Beyond colonization, other work stresses that social trust
ameliorates two frictions that often impede financial transactions—unfamiliar counterparties and
intertemporal exchange, and shows that historically determined differences in social trust shape
modern financial development (e.g., Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales 2004, Karlan, 2005). 2
In a recent paper, Pierce and Snyder (2017a) open up a new line of research by showing
that the historical slave trade in Africa between 1400 and 1900 helps explain the degree to which
current firms have access to credit. Their work builds on Nunn (2008), who demonstrates that the
intensity with which people were enslaved and extracted from African countries is negatively
associated with modern economic development. To provide evidence on the potential role of
finance in linking the African slave trade to modern economic development, Pierce and Snyder
(2017a) demonstrate that firms in high-slave-extraction countries have less access to credit today.
Researchers, however, have not yet explored the mechanisms through which the slave trade
influences modern finance. Evidence on the mechanisms will help distinguish among different
views of how social cohesion influences finance and contribute additional evidence on whether
the slave trade exerts a causal effect on financial development.

On finance for growth, see, for example, King and Levine (1993), Jayaratne and Strahan (1996), Levine and
Zervos (1998), Rajan and Zingales (1998), and the literature reviews by Levine (2005a) and Popov (2018).
2
Furthermore, on trust, Bottazzi, Da Rin, and Hellman (2016) document the impact of trust on venture capital
investments, Karlan (2005) finds that social trust is associated with individuals’ willingness to lend money to others,
McMillan and Woodruff (1999) demonstrate the importance of interfirm trust for trade credit in Vietnam, Karlan,
Rosenblat, and Szeidl (2009) show that trust facilitates borrowing in Peru. For an insightful treatment of how
geography and the law shape economies, see Berkowitz and Clay (2011).

2

In this paper, we empirically evaluate three mechanisms through which the historical
African slave trade might shape modern finance. First, as emphasized by Lovejoy (2000) and
Nunn and Wantchekon (2011), enslavement often occurred through inter-African village wars
and raids that created a culture of distrust that persists till today. Distrust, in turn, can harm the
operation of financial markets by impeding both transactions among unfamiliar counterparties
and intertemporal exchange. To assess this mechanism, we examine whether the intensity with
which people were enslaved and extracted from African regions is negatively associated with
trust in financial institutions today. Second, the breakdown in social cohesion generated by the
slave trades tended to limit economic and social interactions to members of small clans and
therefore impeded both the formation of economies of efficient sizes (Alesina and Spolaore 1997;
Kusimba 2004) and the development of institutions that facilitate transactions between diffuse
non-clan members. For example, efficient economies develop institutions for sharing credit
information about potential borrowers, and the resultant reduction in information asymmetries
tends to improve the functioning of financial systems, as shown by Pagano and Jappelli (1993)
and Djankov, McLiesh, and Shleifer (2007). Thus, we explore the connections between slave
exports during the 1400 – 1900 period and current measures of the quality of modern institutions
for sharing credit information. Third, by fragmenting societies into small clans, the slave trade
helped solidify and perpetuate narrow ethnic identities (Alesina and La Ferrara 2000; Nunn
2008). Easterly and Levine (1997) emphasize that ethnic fragmentation can stymie the
development of institutions associated with property rights protection and contract enforcement,
which are essential for financial development. To evaluate this third mechanism, we examine the
association between the slave trade and indicators of the quality of the legal system. Thus, the
purpose of our paper is to assess different views of how the historical slave trade—a major shock
to social cohesion—continues to influence modern financial systems.
Besides evaluating these mechanisms, we also contribute to research on the historical
determinants of financial development by examining household finance and overall financial
development. Pierce and Snyder (2017a) examine the relationship between the slave trade and

3

firm access to credit, which Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic (1998), Rajan and Zingales (1998),
and others stress is of first-order importance for economic growth. Financial systems, however,
also provide welfare-promoting credit to households (Campbell 2006). For example, in many
countries, credit allows households to cushion shocks to family income, which reduces
disruptions in the education of their children (e.g., Jacoby 1994 and Jacoby and Skoufias 1997),
and when financial systems allow households to purchase homes, the accumulated home equity
provides collateral for new business ventures. Thus, we test the links between the historical slave
trade and household finance. Furthermore, since much of the work on finance and economic
development has been conducted at the country level, we also assess the impact of the historical
slave trade on overall financial development today.
To conduct our study, we assemble data on slave exports from 49 African countries and
other potential determinants of financial development. Nunn (2008) provides data on the
intensity with which people were enslaved and exported from each country. In particular, Slave
exports equals the natural logarithm of the total number of slaves taken from each country during
the period from 1400 through 1900 divided by the size of the country in millions of square
kilometers. We also control for other historical characteristics of financial development that have
been identified by past research. For example, La Porta et al. (1998) find that a country’s legal
origin, as defined by its European colonizer, explains current investor protection laws, contract
enforcement efficiency, and hence financial development in general. Acemoglu, Johnson, and
Robinson (2001) show that a country’s natural resource endowments influenced the political
institutions instilled by European colonizers, which have had enduring effects on modern
financial systems. Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt, and Levine (2003) and Stulz and Williamson (2003)
examine the impact of cultural differences, including religion, on finance. We therefore control
for legal origin, natural resource endowments, and other cultural and national traits in assessing
the relation between the slave trade and the operation of modern financial systems.
Our analyses are divided into two parts: assessing the relation between the historical
slave trade and modern financial development and dissecting the mechanisms linking the slave

4

trade and the operation of financial systems. We begin by evaluating the relationship between the
historical slave trade and three measures of modern financial development—overall financial
development, household access to finance, and firm access to credit. To measure overall
financial development, we use standard country-level measures of overall bank development that
have been used to assess the impact of finance on growth, such as bank credit to the private
sector as a share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Second, we use household survey data to
construct measures of household access to credit, such as whether the household has ever
received a loan or obtained a credit card. Third, we use firm-level data to construct measures of
firm access to credit that are similar to those used in Pierce and Snyder (2017a). We add to this
line of research by exploring whether the negative relationship between firm financing
constraints today and the intensity of slave exports during the 1400 – 1900 period varies across
industries in a theoretically consistent manner. Specifically, if slave exports influenced social
cohesion in ways that continue to impede the efficient financing of firms, then the association
between slave exports and obtaining external finance should be especially pronounced in firms
that depend, for technological reasons, on external finance. We test this prediction using the
approach in Rajan and Zingales (1998) and Raddatz (2006).
We find that the intensity of slave exports during the 1400 – 1900 period is strongly,
negatively associated with modern levels of overall financial development, household access to
finance, and firm access to credit. The results hold when controlling for other historical
determinants of financial development, the level and growth rate of GDP per capita, and many
other country traits. When examining household or firm access to credit, the results are robust to
controlling for household and firm characteristics respectively, such as the income, education,
gender, and age of the person and the firm’s size, growth, profitability, age, etc. For the firmlevel analyses, we find that the slave trade has a negative relationship with firm access to credit.
Moreover, the negative association between slave exports and accessing external finance is
especially pronounced in firms that depend, for technological reasons, on external finance.

5

The second part of our analyses examines three potential mechanisms linking the slave
trade to modern financial development—information sharing, trust in financial institutions, and
the legal system’s effectiveness in enforcing contracts and protecting investors. To examine the
information sharing mechanisms, the World Bank’s Doing Business Data provides information
on the quality of national systems for obtaining and sharing information about the
creditworthiness of borrowers. To examine the trust in financial institutions mechanisms, we use
the World Bank’s Financial Inclusion Data to construct measures of the degree of trust that
people have in banks. To examine the legal system mechanism, we use measures of the legal
rights of creditors and shareholders, the efficiency of resolving insolvencies, and the efficiency
of contract enforcement from the World Bank’s Doing Business Data, compiled using
methodologies developed in Djankov, McLiesh, and Shleifer (2007), Djankov, Hart, McLiesh
and Shleifer (2008), and Djankov, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (2003).
We discover that the historical slave is strongly related to the information sharing and
trust mechanisms but not to the legal mechanism. On the information mechanism, we find that
the intensity of slave exports is negatively associated with the quality of information sharing
about the creditworthiness of borrowers, and this finding is robust to controlling for the same
factors discussed above. Moreover, we find that the slave trade is significantly and negatively
associated with Private bureau coverage, but insignificantly associated with Public registry
coverage. This is consistent with the views that (1) the historical slave trade impedes people’s
willingness to voluntarily share information with others, as private credit bureaus are not
operated by the public sector and (2) the historical slave reduces information sharing, as Djankov,
McLiesh, and Shleifer (2007) show that private bureaus are more effective at sharing credit
information than public registries. The estimated effects are large. If we consider the conceptual
experiment of a country moving from the 75th percentile of the cross-country distribution of
Slave exports to the 25th percentile, the estimates indicate that the quality of information sharing
would rise by more than 100% of the sample mean.

6

We also find strong support for the trust in financial institutions mechanism. We show
that there is a large, positive, and statistically significant relation between slave exports during
the 1400 – 1900 period and mistrust in financial institutions today. The results hold across
individuals with different education levels, suggesting that the slave trade left an enduring
cultural scar that does not seem to be mitigated by education. The estimated coefficients suggest
that the economic impact of slave exports on mistrust is large. Using the same conceptual
experiment of moving from the 75th to the 25th percentile of the distribution of Slave exports, the
estimates indicate that mistrust in financial institutions would fall by about 66% of the sample
mean.
We do not, however, find support for the view that the slave trade influences financial
development through the legal mechanisms. Specifically, we do not find a strong connection
between the intensity of slave exports and the legal rights of creditors and shareholders, the
efficiency of resolving insolvencies, or the effectiveness of contract enforcement today. This is
consistent with the view that Europeans exported legal origins that continue to shape the
financial contracting environment and that the historical slave trade did not exert an independent
effect on financial development through this legal channel.
The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data and
empirical methodology. Section 3 presents the results examining the relationship between slave
exports and overall financial development, household access to credit, and firm access to credit.
Section 4 presents evidence on the mechanisms, and Section 5 concludes.

2. DATA
In this section, we define the key data that we use to evaluate the relationship between
historical African slave trade and modern financial development and the potential mechanisms
linking the slave trade to the functioning of current financial systems. Appendix Table A1 gives
detailed variable definitions, and Table 1 provides summary statistics.

2.1 The Slave Trade Measure
We use the slave trade measures constructed by Nunn (2008). Specifically, Slave exports
equals the natural logarithm of the total number of slaves taken from each country during the
period from 1400 through 1900, divided by the size of the country, as measured in millions of
square kilometers. To estimate the total number of slaves taken from each country, Nunn (2008)
first calculates the total number of slaves shipped from each coastal country in Africa. He then
uses ethnic identity data on a sample of slaves exported from Africa to impute the proportion of
slaves extracted from each country in Africa during the 1400 – 1900 period. If no slaves were
exported from a country, Nunn (2008) uses a value of 0.1 for the total number of slaves exported
from a country, so that Slave exports is set to -2.3.
As shown in Table 1, Slave exports ranges from -2.3 to 8.8, indicating that the total
number of slaves taken from a country ranges from 0 to 6,756 relative to a country’s land area.
We use data from 51 countries. Although there are 52 countries in the Nunn (2008) sample, we
exclude Somalia due to a lack of financial development data. The median ratio of total slaves
exported to land area is 102. There is considerable cross-country variation. Angola exported the
largest number of slaves (more than 3.6 million from a single country), whereas 11 countries,
such as Swaziland and Tunisia, exported virtually no slaves.

2.2 Financial Development Indicators
We use several financial development indicators and organize the presentation of these
indicators by whether they are based on country-, household-, or firm-level data.
First, we use two cross-country indicators of overall financial development (Global
Financial Development Database, 2016; Čihák et al., 2013). We focus on banks, because banks
represent the bulk of African financial systems. Private credit to GDP equals the total credit
provided by domestic money banks (commercial banks and other deposit-taking financial
institutions) to the private sector as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) averaged over
the 2006 – 2014 period. It measures the extent to which a country’s savings are channeled to
private borrowers through financial institutions. As reported in Table 1, Private credit to GDP
ranges from three percent of GDP in the Democratic Republic of Congo to 85 percent of GDP in
Mauritius. The sample mean is 21, with a standard deviation of 18. Bank deposits to GDP equals
the total value of demand, time, and saving deposits in banks as a percentage of GDP. It is also
averaged over the 2006 – 2014 period. Holding other things constant, people will deposit more in
banks if they have greater trust in the country’s financial institutions.
Second, we use two indicators of household access to credit from the World Bank’s
Financial Inclusion Database 2014. Borrow from financial institutions equals one if the
respondent borrowed from a formal financial institution during 12 months before the 2014
survey and zero otherwise. The average across survey participants with countries varies widely.
For example, over 16% of respondents had a received a loan in the last year in Uganda,
Botswana, and Mauritius, while less than 2.5% of respondents received a loan in the last year in
Cameroon, Niger, and Guinea. We also examine Credit card, which equals one if the respondent
reports having a credit card and zero otherwise. Credit card also varies materially. The average
across survey participants in Mauritius and South Africa is greater than 16%, while it is below
0.5% in Madagascar, Sudan, and Ethiopia.
Third, we use firm-level data from the World Bank’s Enterprise Survey to gauge the
degree to which firms (a) access finance from financial institutions, and (b) provide and receive

9

trade credit from other firms. The Enterprise Survey consists of almost 20,000 firm-year
observations from 40 African countries over the period from 2006 through 2015. The survey also
collects information on other firm attributes, including the number of employees, age,
profitability, industry, growth, whether it exports to other countries, and ownership. This allows
us to control for firm-specific characteristics in assessing the relation between the slave trade and
firms’ access to finance.
More specifically, we use the following four variables. Working capital financed from
banks equals the proportion of working capital in a firm that is financed by borrowing from
banks. Investment financed from banks equals the proportion of a firm’s long-term investment
(i.e., purchases of fixed assets) that is financed by borrowing from banks. With respect to trade
credit, we use two measures. Trade payable equals the share of total annual purchases of
material inputs or services that are paid for after delivery. It measures the extent to which a firm
obtains trade credit from its suppliers. Trade receivable equals the proportion of a firm’s total
sales that are paid for after delivery. This measure captures the extent to which a firm provides
trade credit to its customers.

2.3 Mechanism Indicators
We examine three potential mechanisms through which the historical African slave trade
continues to influence financial systems across Africa: information sharing institutions, trust in
financial institutions, and the legal system’s effectiveness in supporting financial contracting. In
this subsection, we describe the measures that we use for each mechanism.
First, we examine three cross-country measures of the quality of information sharing
institutions from the World Bank’s Doing Business Data. The data are compiled using the
methodologies initially developed by Djankov, McLiesh, and Shleifer (2007) with slight changes.
We analyze these measures because Pagano and Jappelli (1993) and Djankov, McLiesh, and
Shleifer (2007) show that information sharing about borrower creditworthiness facilitates the

10

flow of bank credit to the private sector. That is, the quality of information sharing is a key factor
shaping the operation of national financial systems. The three measures are as follows.
Depth of credit information is an index of the coverage, scope, and accessibility of credit
information. It uses data on the range of firms and individuals for which credit information is
distributed, the types of credit information that are distributed and whether historical data are
available, and the ease with which borrowers or lenders (banks and other financial institutions)
can obtain credit information. The variable ranges from 0 to 8, with higher values indicating
greater coverage, scope, and accessibility of credit information.
Private bureau coverage measures the extent to which private credit bureaus (private
firms or nonprofit organizations) maintain a database on the creditworthiness of borrowers
(individuals or firms) and facilitate the exchange of credit information among creditors. It equals
the number of individuals and firms listed in a credit bureau, with information on their borrowing
history within the past five years, plus the number of individuals and firms that have had no
borrowing history in the past five years but for which a lender requested a credit report from the
bureau during the past year, as a percentage of the adult population.
Public registry coverage measures the extent to which a public credit registry, which is
usually managed by the central bank or the bank supervisory agency, collects information on the
creditworthiness of borrowers (individuals or firms) and facilitates the exchange of credit
information among banks and other regulated financial institutions. It equals the number of
individuals and firms listed in a public credit registry, with information on their borrowing
history within the past five years, plus the number of individuals and firms that have had no
borrowing history in the past five years but for which a lender requested a credit report from the
registry during the past year, as a percentage of the adult population.
Second, we exploit household survey data from the World Bank on the degree of
individual mistrust in financial institutions (Financial Inclusion Data). We examine mistrust in
financial institutions because Nunn and Wantchekon (2011) show that the African slave trade
had lasting effects on trust and an extensive literature shows that trust has first-order effects on

11

financial systems (e.g., Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales 2004; Aghion, Algan, Cahuc, and Shleifer
2010; and Ayyagari, Demirgüç-Kunt, and Maksimovic 2010, 2011). In particular, Mistrust in
financial institutions equals one for respondents who indicate that they do not have a bank
account because they do not trust financial institutions, and zero otherwise. In Mauritius, only
0.3% of the respondents indicate a lack of trust in banks, while 22% of the respondents from
Niger respond that they do not trust banks or other formal financial institutions.
Third, we examine four indicators of the degree to which the legal system supports
financial contracting, all of which are obtained from the World Bank’s Doing Business Data.
Legal rights of creditors and debtors measures the degree to which collateral and bankruptcy
laws protect the claims of creditors, which promotes the availability of credit, as shown by
Djankov, McLiesh, and Shleifer (2007). Strength of insolvency framework index measures the
effectiveness of country’s legal system in resolving insolvency, which Djankov et al. (2008)
suggest facilitates external financing. Contract enforcement time measures how long it typically
takes to resolve a commercial dispute. More specifically, it equals logarithm of the average
number of days, from the moment that a creditor, for example, files a lawsuit until the plaintiff
receives payment (conditional the creditor wins the lawsuit). Contract enforcement cost
measures the direct costs (e.g., legal and other fees) of resolving a commercial dispute. It equals
costs of instituting a typical commercial claim as a percentage of the typical claim value. As
discussed in Djankov et al. (2003), both Contract enforcement time and Contract enforcement
cost are linked to the willingness of lenders to lend and hence to household and firm access to
credit.

2.4 Other Country Traits
Research shows that several historically determined national traits influence financial
development and we control for these key traits in assessing the independent link between the
African slave trade and the functioning of modern financial systems across Africa. First, French
legal origin equals one if the origins of country’s legal system are the French civil law and zero

12

if the system has British common law origins, as all of the countries in our sample have either
French or British legal origins. We use this measure based on the seminal findings in La Porta et
al. (1997, 1998). They show that (1) former colonies that inherited British common law systems
tend to have legal systems that better protect creditors and minority shareholders than former
colonies with French legal origins and (2) these legal system differences materially shaped crosscountry differences in financial development. Thus, we use French legal origin as an exogenous
source of variation in national legal systems that shape financial systems.
Second, as emphasized by Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001), Beck, DemirgüçKunt, and Levine (2003), Levine (2005b), and Easterly and Levine (2003, 2016), Europeans
adjusted their colonization strategies based on how familiar and hospitable they found conditions
around the world. In places where Europeans found hospitable environments, they tended to
settle and create institutions that protect private property rights, check against government power,
and reduce contractual and informational impediments to competitive markets. In places with
less hospitable conditions, Europeans were more likely to set up extractive states that had
enduring, adverse repercussions on the country’s institutional development in general and
financial development in particular. To quantify cross-country differences in the degree to which
Europeans found more or less familiar and hospitable conditions, we use (1) Latitude, which
equals the logarithm of the absolute distance between each country and the equator and (2)
Settler mortality, which equals the annualized death rates faced by European settlers in European
colonies in the early 19th century and is obtained from Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001).
We have data on Settler mortality for 37 out of 51 countries in our sample.
Third, several researchers stress that religion and the length of time a country has been
independent can also influence financial development. For example, La Porta et al. (1999), Beck,
Demirgüç-Kunt, and Levine (2003), and Stulz and Williamson (2003) find that religious
differences shape the functioning of legal and financial institutions. Consequently, we control for
each country’s religious composition. In particular, Catholic, Muslim, Protestant, and Other
equal the shares of the population that are Catholic, Muslim, Protestant, or another religions

13

respectively in 1980. We refer to these four variables as Culture controls. In addition, we control
for how long each country has been independent. Easterly and Levine (2003) and Beck,
Demirgüç-Kunt, and Levine (2003) emphasize that longer periods of independence from colonial
rules allowed countries to develop institutions that support economic and financial development.
To capture this view, we control for Independence, which equals 2006 minus a country’s first
year of independence.
Besides these historically determined factors, we control for contemporaneous
macroeconomic conditions in some sensitivity analyses. From the World Development Indicators
(WDI, 2016), we control for GDP per capita, which equals the natural logarithm of gross
domestic product divided by total population; GDP per capita growth, which equals the annual
growth rate of GDP per capita; and Inflation, which equals the annual growth rate of the GDP
deflator since Boyd, Levine and Smith (2001) show that inflation harms the operation of
financial systems. All three of the Macroeconomic controls are computed as the average over the
2006 – 2014 period.
In the household-level analyses, we control for a set of individual demographics,
including an education indicator that equals one if an individual’s educational attainment is
secondary or more, indicators of income quintile, age and age squared, and a gender indicator.
Finally, in the firm-level analyses, we control for the following firm specific
characteristics. Firm size equals the logarithm of the total number of employees; Firm age equals
the logarithm of the number of years since a firm starts operation; Profitability equals the ratio of
net profits to total sales; Government (Foreign) is an indicator that equals one if a firm has
positive government (foreign) ownership, and zero otherwise; Exports is a dummy variable that
equals one if a firm has a positive share of sales exported outside of the country, and zero
otherwise; Sales growth is the median value of firms’ sales growth within an industry in each
year.

3. SLAVE EXPORTS AND MODERN FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT
In this section, we evaluate the relationship between the African slave trade and modern
finance across Africa. We examine three categories of financial development indicators: countrylevel measures of overall financial development, household-level indicators of household access
to credit, and firm-level measures of the degree to which firms obtain credit.
To address the potential omitted variables concern, we first note that Nunn (2008) shows
that the intensity with which people were enslaved and exported from different parts of Africa
reflects the demand for slaves from around the world during the 1400 — 1900 period. In
particular, the travel distances between an African country and the largest demanders of slaves
predict the exportation of people from across Africa to those slave markets. Exports do not
reflect differences in the characteristics of the African regions beyond their distances to those
slave-demanding markets, suggesting that potential omitted variables about the African country
are unlikely to drive the results. 3
Furthermore, we use a control function approach and saturate the regressions with many
regressors to reduce omitted variable concerns. We present results both when conditioning on a
wide array of country characteristics and when not including contemporaneous indicators of
economic conditions in the country. The results—both in terms of statistical significance and the
estimated coefficient on Slave exports—vary little when changing the conditioning information
set, further suggesting that omitted variables are not biasing the estimates.

3.1 Country-level Measures of Overall Financial Development

3

Nunn (2008) uses (1) the minimum sailing distance from the point on the African coast that is closest to the
country within Africa and the closest trans-Atlantic market for slaves, (2) the minimum sailing distance from the
point on the African coast that is closes to the country to the closest of two trans-Indian Ocean markets for slaves (3)
the overland distance from a country to the closest trans-Saharan trading post for slaves, and (4) the overland
distance from a country to the closest ports of exporting slaves via the Red Sea. When we use these distances as
instrumental variables for Slave exports, we confirm our findings.

15

We begin by using cross-country, OLS regressions to evaluate the relationship between
the number of slaves that were taken from a country (relative to the size of the country) during
the 1400 – 1900 period and measures of overall financial development. Specifically, we use the
following regression specification:
𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐 + 𝑿𝑿′𝒄𝒄 𝚪𝚪 + 𝜀𝜀𝑐𝑐 ,

(1)

where the dependent variable, 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐 , is one of the country-level (c) measures of financial

development: Private credit to GDP or Bank deposits to GDP. The key explanatory variable is
𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐 from country c, the other explanatory variables, Xc, control for an array of

country c characteristics, and 𝚪𝚪 represents the vector of coefficient estimates on these controls. In

all of the regressions, we control for French legal origin, Latitude, Culture controls, and
Independence. In several specifications, we control for GDP per capita, GDP per capita growth,
Inflation, and Settler mortality. Our coefficient of interest is 𝛽𝛽, which gauges the relationship
between historical slave exports and overall financial development today. We report
heteroskedasticity robust p-values in parentheses.
As shown in Table 2, the extent to which slaves were exported from a country is strongly,
negatively associated with financial development today when using either Private credit to GDP
or Bank deposits to GDP to measure financial development. For example, consider the Private
credit to GDP regressions. Slave exports enters negatively and significantly at least at the five
percent level and the estimated coefficients are economically large. For example, if a country
were to move from the 75th percentile of the cross-country distribution of Slave exports (6.66) to
the 25th percentile (-1.47), the coefficient estimates from column (2) imply that Private credit to
GDP would jump by 13.7, where the sample median value of Private credit to GDP equals 15.1.
Furthermore, the findings are robust to controlling for plausibly exogenous country
characteristics (French legal origin, Latitude, Religion controls, and Independence) in column
(1), when also conditioning on contemporaneous macroeconomic conditions (GDP per capita,
GDP per capita growth, and Inflation) in column (2), and when further controlling for Settler

16

mortality, which causes the sample size to drop materially, in column (3). Thus, the negative
association between Slave exports and current financial development is not a simple
manifestation of the impact of the slave trades on these other country characteristics.

3.2 Household Access to Finance
We next turn to the question: Is the intensity with which people were enslaved and
exported from African during the 1400 – 1900 period related to the degree to which household
access credit today. We use the following regression specification:
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻_𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐 + 𝑿𝑿′𝒄𝒄 𝚪𝚪 + +𝑿𝑿′𝒊𝒊 𝚭𝚭 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖 ,

(2)

where the dependent variable, 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻_𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐 , is one of our two measures of the degree to which

household i in country c has obtained credit from the formal financial system: Borrow from
financial institutions or Credit card. Since the dependent variables are binary, we use a probit
regression. We report heteroskedasticity consistent p-values, where the standard errors are
clustered at the country level.
With respect to the explanatory variables, the country-level variables—𝑆𝑆𝑙𝑙𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐

and Xc—are the same as those used in the estimation of equation (1) but equation (2) also
includes household-level controls, where Xi are the individual-level control variables, and 𝜡𝜡

represents the vector of coefficients on these individual-level controls. For Xi, we include the
person’s education, income quintile, gender, age and a quadratic in age. Our coefficient of
interest is 𝛽𝛽, which measures the relationship between slave exports and household access to
finance.

The results in Table 3 indicate that the intensity of the historical slave trade is negatively
associated with household access to credit across Africa. Slave exports enters negatively and
significantly in all of the regressions. This holds when the dependent variable is either Borrow
from financial institutions or Credit card. With respect to the economic sizes of the estimated
coefficients, consider the regression of Borrow from financial institutions on Slave exports and

17

the set of control variables in column (2) that includes GDP per capita, GDP per capita growth,
and the large array of other conditioning variables. The estimates indicate that if a country were
to move from the 75th percentile of the cross-country distribution of Slave exports (6.66) to the
25th percentile (-1.47), the probability that an average person in that country would have received
a loan from a formal financial institution would rise by almost 4 percentage points, which
amounts to more than 50% of the sample mean of Borrow from financial institutions. This
suggests that the relationship between the intensity of slave exports during the half a millennium
from 1400 until 1900 is powerfully related to the current degree to which households obtain
loans from formal financial institutions.

3.3 Firm Access to Finance
For the firm-level analyses, we begin with the following regression equation:
𝐹𝐹𝑓𝑓,𝑐𝑐 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐 + 𝑿𝑿′𝒄𝒄 𝚪𝚪 + 𝑿𝑿′𝒇𝒇 𝚯𝚯 + 𝚿𝚿 + 𝜀𝜀𝑓𝑓 ,

(3)

where the dependent variable, 𝐹𝐹𝑓𝑓,𝑐𝑐 , is either Working capital financed from banks, Investment

financed from banks, Trade payable, or Trade receivables for firm f in country c. The key
explanatory variable is 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐 and the other country-level explanatory variables are Xc

(French legal origin, Culture controls, Latitude, Independence, as well as GDP per capita, GDP
per capita growth, and Inflation in some specifications), with the corresponding coefficient
vector 𝚪𝚪.

The regressions also control for firm-specific characteristics, Xf, Firm size, Firm age,

Sales growth, Profitability, Government ownership, Foreign ownership, and Exports, with their
corresponding coefficient vector 𝚯𝚯. In addition, we include industry and year fixed effects, as

denoted by 𝚿𝚿, to account for time-invariant factors within the same industry (at the three-digit

International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) level), and common time-varying factors.
We report heteroskedasticity robust p-values, where the standard errors are clustered at the
country level.

18

Consistent with Pierce and Snyder (2017a), we find that firms tend to receive much less
financing from banks today in countries that had more Slave exports during the 1400 – 1900
period. As shown in Panel A of Table 4 columns (1) – (2) and (5) – (6), whether excluding or
including the macroeconomic controls, Slave exports enters negatively and significantly in the
regressions where the dependent variable is either Working capital financed from banks or
Investment financed from banks. The estimated economic magnitudes are large. Consider, for
example, the coefficients reported in Panel A columns (5) and (6). They suggest that a one
standard deviation increase in Slave exports (3.9) diminishes the proportion of working capital
financed from banks and the proportion of long-term investment financed from banks by about
0.059 (=0.015*3.9) and 0.086 (=0.022*3.9), respectively, which is equivalent to about 65% of
the sample average of both Working capital financed from banks (0.086) and Investment
financed from banks (0.131). One potential concern with interpreting these results is that it could
be a demand side rather than a supply side effect. Perhaps, cross-country differences in the
intensity of slave exports influence the nature of production in economies and hence the degree
to which firms demand bank finance. This is a different interpretation from the one in which
slave exports shape the functioning of financial systems and hence the supply of bank credit.
Pierce and Snyder (2017a), however, show that there is a strong, positive association between
slave exports and firms reporting that they need finance but could not get it. This suggests that
access to finance is more difficult in countries that experienced more slave exports. 4
Furthermore, we find that Slave exports are negatively associated with the degree to
which a firm provides trade credit to (Trade receivable) and receives trade credit from (Trade
payable) other firms. 5 Consistent with the earlier findings, the regressions in columns (3) – (4)

4

Also, see the discussion in Pierce and Snyder (2017b) and the work on the historical determinants of organizations
by Kluppel, Pierce, and Snyder (2017).
5
As trade credit does not typically involve collateral or promissory notes subject to formal judicial enforcement
mechanisms, it relies heavily on trust between business partners and access to credit information on other firms. To
the extent that a more intensive experience with the slave trade had enduring repercussions on social trust and the
development of information sharing institutions, slave exports during the 1400 – 1900 period are expected to be
negatively associated with trade credit today.

19

and (7) – (8) of Table 4 Panel A show that Slave exports variable enters negatively and
significantly in both the Trade receivable and Trade payable regressions.

3.4 Firm Access to Finance: Differentiating by Industry
We next explore whether the associations between Slave exports and (a) firm access to
formal credit and (b) firm access to and provision of trade credit vary across industries in a
theoretically predictable manner. In particular, if the intensity of slave exports in the 1400 – 1900
period has had enduring, deleterious effects on the financial system in a manner that impedes
firms from obtaining credit from formal financial institutions, then the relationship between
Slave exports and firm financing should be especially pronounced in industries that depend, for
technological reasons, on credit from financial institutions. Second, and similarly, if the severity
of the slave trade has had lasting effects on the institutions that facilitate trade credit between
firms, the relationship between Slave exports and trade credit should be especially pronounced in
industries that naturally rely heavily on trade credit. If these two cross-industry predictions hold,
it would reduce concerns that the previous results are spurious or reflect an omitted variable.
We differentiate industries by their “technological” dependence on (a) external finance
from financial institutions and (b) trade credit. With respect to dependence on external finance
from financial institutions, we follow Rajan and Zingales (1998) and use the variable External
finance dependence (EFD), which equals the fraction of capital expenditures not financed with
internally generated cash flows in the United States. Rajan and Zingales (1998) argue that since
U.S. financial markets are relatively frictionless, EFD provides information on the degree to
which firms in an industry depend on external finance for technological reasons. Given the level
of economic and technological development in Africa, we use U.S. data over the earliest
available decade, the 1970s, to calculate EFD at the three-digit ISIC level. With respect to an
industry’s dependence on trade credit, we follow Raddatz (2006) and use the proportion of
inventories not financed by current sales, Liquidity needs, which is also calculated at the threedigit ISIC level using U.S. data over the 1970s.

20

We use the following regression specification to assess the relationship between firm
financing and the slave trade while differentiating by industry.
𝐹𝐹𝑓𝑓,𝑐𝑐 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛾𝛾𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐 ∗ 𝐼𝐼𝑓𝑓 + 𝑿𝑿′𝒄𝒄 𝚪𝚪 + 𝑿𝑿′𝒇𝒇 𝚯𝚯 + 𝚲𝚲 + 𝜀𝜀𝑓𝑓 ,

(4)

where the dependent variable, 𝐹𝐹𝑓𝑓,𝑐𝑐 , is either Working capital financed from banks, Investment

finance from banks, Trade payable, or Trade receivables for firm f in country c. The key

explanatory variable is the interaction term, 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐 ∗ 𝐼𝐼𝑓𝑓 , where 𝐼𝐼𝑓𝑓 is one of two
variables indicating the nature of firm f’s industry. Specifically, 𝐼𝐼𝑓𝑓 equals EFD when the

dependent variable is Working capital financed from banks or Investment financed from banks,
and 𝐼𝐼𝑓𝑓 equals Liquidity needs when the dependent variable is either Trade payable or Trade
receivables. The country-level and firm-level explanatory variables (Xc and Xf, respectively) are
the same as in equation (3). In these interaction term analyses, we also include several fixed
effects, as represented by 𝚲𝚲. In particular, we control for country fixed effects, industry fixed
effects, and year fixed effects. As a result, Slave exports drops as a regressor and the countrylevel controls only include the time-varying Macroeconomic controls: GDP per capita, GDP per
capita growth, and Inflation. Similarly, 𝐼𝐼𝑓𝑓 drops from the regression when including industry
fixed effects. We use heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered at the country level.

As reported in Panel B of Table 4, the relationships between Slave exports and the firm
financing indicators vary across industries in a manner that is fully consistent with the two
theoretical predictions articulated above. In particular, as shown in columns (1) – (2) and (5) –
(6), Slave exports*EFD enters negatively and significantly in both the Working capital financed
from banks and Investment finance from banks regressions, indicating that the relationship
between Slave exports and obtaining financing from banks is especially strong in industries that
naturally depend heavily on credit from financial institutions. The results hold when excluding
contemporaneous macroeconomic controls or including them. The cross-industry results also
hold when differentiating by each industry’s technological dependence on trade finance. As
shown in columns (3) – (4) and (7) – (8), the interaction term, Slave exports*Liquidity needs,

21

enters negatively and significantly in both the Trade payable and Trade receivables regressions. 6
Thus, the relationship between the intensity of the slave trades in 1400 – 1900 and the financing
of firms today holds more strongly among firms in industries that rely heavily, for technological
reasons, on funding from either financial institutions or other companies, which is consistent
with the view that slave exports had enduring, harmful effects on the operation of financial
systems. 7

4. MECHANISMS LINKING SLAVE EXPORTS AND MODERN FINANCE
We now evaluate three mechanisms through which the historical African slave trade
might continue to influence modern financial systems across Africa. We divide the section into
three subsections corresponding to the three mechanisms: Information sharing institutions, trust
in financial institutions, and legal institutions.

4.1 Information Sharing Institutions
We begin by examining the relationship between the intensity with which people were
enslaved and exported from Africa and the quality of information sharing institutions today. As
shown by Pagano and Jappelli (1993) and Djankov, McLiesh, and Shleifer (2007), the degree to
which economies develop mechanisms for obtaining and sharing information on the
creditworthiness of borrowers influences the efficient operation of financial systems. Moreover,
Djankov, McLiesh, and Shleifer (2007) discover that private credit bureaus are generally
superior to public credit registries in effectively collecting and disseminating credit information.
6

The results are weaker in Trade payable regressions. This might result from the possibility that firms in high slavetrade countries obtain trade credit from foreign suppliers, thereby attenuating the coefficient estimates on the
interaction term, Slave exports*Liquidity needs.
7
The estimated economic magnitudes are large. For example, consider the estimates from column (6) of Table 4
Panel B, in which the dependent variable is Investment financed from banks. The industry at the 75th percentile of
EFD (0.280) is Restaurants, and the industry at the 25th percentile (-0.066) is Dairy products. The country at the 75th
percentile of Slave trade (6.66) is Mozambique, and the country at the 25th percentile of Slave trade (-1.47) is
Central African Republic. Setting the other factors to their sample mean values, the coefficient estimate on Slave
trade*EFD (-0.01) predicts that Restaurants would receive 0.028 less Investment financed from banks than Dairy
products, in Mozambique as compared to Central African Republic (-0.028 = -0.010*8.13*0.346). This magnitude is
not small, given that the sample average of Investment financed from banks equals 0.13.

22

Thus, we examine the three measures of the quality of information sharing institutions defined
above: Depth of credit information, which is an index of the coverage, scope, and accessibility of
credit information; Private bureau coverage, which measures the functioning of private credit
bureaus; and Public registry coverage, measures the operations of public credit registries.
We use cross-country, OLS regressions to evaluate the relationship between the quality
of information sharing institutions and Slave exports:
𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑐𝑐 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐 + 𝑿𝑿′𝒄𝒄 𝚪𝚪 + 𝜀𝜀𝑐𝑐 ,

(5)

where the dependent variable, 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑐𝑐 , is one of three measures of the quality of

information sharing institutions in a country: Depth of credit information, Private bureau
coverage, and Public registry coverage. The other explanatory variables, Xc, are the same as
those used above.
As shown in Table 5, the intensity of slave exports during the 1400 – 1900 period are
strongly, negatively associated with the quality of information sharing institutions today. Slave
exports enters negatively and significantly when the dependent variable is either Depth of credit
information or Private bureau coverage. In contrast, Slave exports enters insignificantly when
the dependent variable is Public registry coverage, which Djankov, McLiesh, and Shleifer (2007)
suggest is not as good an indicator of the quality of information sharing as the other measures.
The contrasting findings on Private bureau coverage and Public registry coverage are also
consistent with the view that the historical slave trade impedes people’s willingness to
voluntarily share information with others, as private credit bureaus are not operated by the public
sector. These results hold when using a simple conditioning information set (French legal origin,
Latitude, Culture controls, and Independence) or when expanding the control variables to
include current macroeconomic conditions. To illustrate the economic magnitudes, we use the
same example from above: If a country were to move from the 75th percentile of the crosscountry distribution of Slave exports (6.66) to the 25th percentile (-1.47), the coefficient estimate

23

on Slave exports (-0.286) from column (2) implies that Depth of credit information would
increase by 2.3, where the average value of Depth of credit information in the sample is 1.7.
These findings are consistent with the view that one mechanism through which the slave
trade continues to influence modern finance is its effects on the quality of information sharing
institutions. As detailed in the Introduction, this view stresses that the slave trade created a
climate of violence and fear that fragmented societies into isolated clans and limited the
development of (1) institutions that facilitate transactions among diffuse non-clan members, and
(2) institutions that share valuable information on the creditworthiness of borrowers and hence
improve the efficient operation of financial systems. We discover that the slave trade is
negatively associated with the quality of information sharing institutions, suggesting that this is
one mechanism linking the slave trade and modern financial development across Africa.

4.2 Trust in Financial Institutions
We next examine the relationship between the slave trade and trust in financial
institutions using the following regression equation.

𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐 + 𝑿𝑿′𝒄𝒄 𝚪𝚪 + +𝑿𝑿′𝒊𝒊 𝚭𝚭 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖 ,

(6)

where the dependent variable is Mistrust in financial institutions as reported by individual i in
country c, the key explanatory variable is 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐 from country c, and the other

regressors are the same as those used in the household-level regressions above. Our coefficient
of interest is 𝛽𝛽, which measures the relationship between slave exports and mistrust in financial
institutions. We conduct the estimation using a Probit model with heteroskedasticity robust

standard errors clustered at the country level. Besides presenting the results with and without the
macroeconomic controls, we also present the results when differentiating between more and less
educated individuals to assess whether the relationship between mistrust in financial institutions
today and slave exports in 1400 – 1900 differs by the level of education.

24

As shown in Table 6, there is a strong positive relationship between Slave exports and
Mistrust in financial institutions. Consider first the full sample results. Slave exports enters
positively and significantly whether excluding or including the macroeconomic controls
(columns (1) and (2)). Furthermore, the coefficient estimates on Slave exports do not vary much
across these two specifications, emphasizing the independent link between the slave trades and
trust in financial institutions. The estimated coefficients from column (2) imply that the
relationship is economically large. If a country were to move from the 75th percentile of the
cross-country distribution of Slave exports (6.66) to the 25th percentile (-1.47), the average
person in that country would tend to report a value of Mistrust in financial institutions that is
0.06 lower than his current response. This is large given that the average value of Mistrust in
financial institutions is 0.09 with a standard deviation of 0.28. We next push these analyses a bit
further by asking: Is the enduring impact of the historical slave trade on mistrust in financial
institutions mitigated by education, or is the slave trade’s influence on culture and social
cohesion largely independent of the degree of education that an individual has received? To shed
some empirical light on this question, we repeated these analyses for two subsamples of
individuals: those who completed primary education or less and those that had at least some
secondary education, which split the sample into two relatively equal sized groups. As shown,
there is little difference in the estimated coefficient on Slave exports between these two
subsamples, though the results become slightly weaker for the more educated group when also
including the macroeconomic controls.
These findings suggest that one mechanism through which the slave trade continues to
influence financial systems across Africa is trust in financial institutions. As summarized in the
Introduction, Nunn and Wantchekon (2011) demonstrate that the slave trade created an enduring
culture of distrust and a large literature demonstrates that social trust exerts a positive impact on
the operation of financial systems by facilitating transactions between unfamiliar counterparties
and transactions that occur over time. In turn, we discover that the slave trade is negatively
associated with trust in financial institutions.

25

4.3 Legal Institutions
We next examine the connection between the African slave trade and the degree to which
the legal system supports financial contracting in the modern African economies. As discussed
above, we use four legal system indicators: (1) Legal rights of creditors and debtors measures
the extent to which laws protect the claims of debtors, which will tend to increase the supply of
credit to firms and households; (2) Strength of insolvency framework index measures the extent
to which the country’s legal system supports the claims of creditors when borrowers default,
which also facilitates the flow of external finance to firms and households; (3) Contract
enforcement time measures how long it typically takes to get paid once a plaintiff files a lawsuit;
and (4) Contract enforcement costs measures the direct costs associated with filing,
implementing, and resolving a lawsuit. Past research shows that both Contract enforcement time
and Contract enforcement costs are negatively related to the provision of external finance. We
use the same cross-country regressions described above in our examination of the relationship
between slave exports and the quality of information sharing institutions.
As reported in Table 7, we do not find a strong connection between Slave exports and any
of the measures of the degree to which the legal system supports financial contracting, with or
without the macroeconomic controls. Neither Legal rights of creditors and debtors, Strength of
insolvency framework index, Contract enforcement time, or Contract enforcement costs enters
the Table 7 regressions significantly. These findings do not suggest that the legal system is
unimportant for financial development. A large literature establishes the importance of the law
for financial contracting. Rather, these findings indicate that the slave trade does not exert an
independent effect on financial contracting environment after controlling for many other factors.

5. CONCLUSIONS

26

In this paper, we contribute to research on two interrelated questions: What are the
historical determinants of national differences in financial development and through which
mechanisms do these historical factors influence the operation of modern financial systems? We
focus on the historical African slave trade during the period from 1400 – 1900, which Nunn and
Wantchekon (2011) show has had an enduring effect on social cohesion and culture across
Africa. More specifically, we examine the impact of the intensity with which people were
captured, enslaved, and exported from Africa on financial development today and key
institutions that shape modern financial systems. With respect to the first question, Pierce and
Snyder (2017a) show that the slave trade is negatively associated with firm access to credit. We
contribute by showing the intensity of the slave trade across African countries is also negatively
associated with household access to credit and overall financial development. We further show
that the negative association between slave exports and firm access to credit varies in a
theoretically predictable manner, as the association is especially pronounced among firms that
depend heavily on external finance for technological reasons.
With respect to the second question, we evaluate three potential mechanisms linking the
historical slave trade to modern finance. A large body of evidence indicates that information
sharing institutions that reduce information asymmetries about potential borrowers, the degree of
trust that individuals have in financial institutions, and the quality of legal institutions influence
the operation of modern financial systems. We discover that the intensity of the African slave
trade in the 1400 – 1900 period is strongly, negatively related to the quality of information
sharing institutions and trust in financial institutions but is not strongly related to legal
institutions. These findings are consistent with the view that two mechanisms through which the
historical slave trade continues to influence modern financial systems across Africa are
information sharing institutions and trust.

Table 2 Slave exports and overall financial development, country-level analyses
This table reports OLS regression results of overall financial development on historical slave exports. The dependent
variable is Private credit to GDP in columns 1-3, and Bank deposits to GDP in columns 4-6, both of which are
averaged across 2006-2014. The key explanatory variable, Slave exports, is from Nunn (2008) and equals the natural
logarithm of the total number of slaves exported from each country between 1400 and 1900 normalized by land area.
French legal origin is an indicator that equals one if a country’s commercial code has a French legal origin, and zero
otherwise. Latitude equals the logarithm of the absolute distance between each country and the equator.
Independence equals 2006 minus a country’s first year of independence. GDP per capita equals the natural
logarithm of gross domestic product per capita (current US dollars); GDP per capita growth is the average annual
growth rate in gross domestic product per capita, both averaged over 2006-2014. Settler mortality equals the
annualized death rate of European soldiers in European colonies in the early 19th century. Culture controls include
percentage of population that follows (a) Catholic, (2) Muslim, and (3) Protestant religion in 1980. Inflation equals
the average annual inflation rate (GDP deflator) over 2006-2014. See the Appendix Table A1 for more detailed
variable definitions and data sources. P-values calculated using heteroskedasticity robust standard errors are reported
in parentheses. *,**, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%.

Table 3 Slave exports and household access to finance, household-level analyses
This table reports Probit regression results of household access to finance on historical slave exports. We use the full
sample in columns 1-2 and 4-5, and the subsample of high earning (top 40%) households in a country in columns 3
and 6. The dependent variable, Borrow from financial institutions, equals to one if a respondent borrowed any
money from a bank or another formal financial institution, and zero otherwise. Credit card is an indicator that equals
one if the respondent is reported to own a credit card that allows one to borrow money in order to make payments or
buy things, and one can pay the balance off later. The key explanatory variable, Slave exports, is from Nunn (2008)
and equals the natural logarithm of the total number of slaves exported from each country between 1400 and 1900
normalized by land area. Individual controls include a gender indicator, age, age squared, three respondent
education fixed effects (the omit group: education (completed tertiary or more)), and five household income level
fixed effects (the omit group: Income (richest 20%)). French legal origin is an indicator that equals one if the
commercial code of a country is French Commercial Code, and zero otherwise. Latitude equals the logarithm of the
absolute distance between each country and the equator. Independence equals 2006 minus a country’s first year of
independence. Culture controls include percentage of population that follows (a) Catholic, (2) Muslim, and (3)
Protestant religion in 1980. GDP per capita equals the natural logarithm of gross domestic product per capita
(current US dollars); GDP per capita growth is the average annual growth rate in gross domestic product per capita,
both averaged over 2006-2014. Inflation equals the average annual inflation rate (GDP deflator) over 2006-2014.
See the Appendix Table A1 for more detailed variable definitions and data sources. P-values calculated using
heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered at the country level are reported in parentheses. *,**, and ***
indicate significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%.

Table 4 Slave exports and firm access to finance, firm-level analyses
This table reports the regression results of the impact of historical slave exports on firm access to finance. Panel A presents the average effects, while Panel B
shows the heterogeneous effects that differentiate industries by their dependence on external finance. The dependent variable is the amount of bank credit as a
proportion of total working capital (Working capital financed from banks), the amount of bank credit for investment as a proportion of total investment
(Investment financed from banks), the proportion of the value of total purchases of material inputs or services that are paid for after delivery (Trade payable), and
the proportion of the value of total sales of goods or services that are paid for after delivery (Trade receivable). The key explanatory variable, Slave exports, is
from Nunn (2008) and equals the natural logarithm of the total number of slaves exported from each country between 1400 and 1900 normalized by land area.
External Financial dependence (EFD) measures the extent to which firms depend on external finance and is calculated at the three-digit ISIC level using U.S.
companies data over the 1970s following the method in Rajan and Zingales (1998). Liquidity needs is defined as the ratio of inventories to total sales calculated
at the three-digit ISIC level using U.S. companies data over the 1970s following Raddatz (2006). Firm-level controls include Firm size, Firm age, Profitability,
Government, Foreign, Exports, and industry Sales growth. Country controls include French legal origin, Culture controls, Latitude, and Independence. We
include Industry (at the three-digit ISIC level) and Year fixed effects throughout all the analyses, and Country fixed effects in Panel B. See the Appendix Table
A1 for detailed variable definitions and data sources. P-values calculated using heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered at the country level are
reported in parentheses. *,**, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%.

Table 5 Slave exports and information sharing institutions
This table reports OLS regression results of information sharing on historical slave exports. The dependent variable
is Depth of credit information in columns 1-2, Private bureau coverage in columns 3-4, and Public registry
coverage in columns 5-6, all measured in 2014, or the earliest available year. The key explanatory variable, Slave
exports, is from Nunn (2008) and equals the natural logarithm of the total number of slaves exported from each
country between 1400 and 1900 normalized by land area. French legal origin is an indicator that equals one if the
commercial code of a country is French Commercial Code, and zero otherwise. Latitude equals the logarithm of the
absolute distance between each country and the equator. Independence equals 2006 minus a country’s first year of
independence. Culture controls include percentage of population that follows (a) Catholic, (2) Muslim, and (3)
Protestant religion in 1980. GDP per capita equals the natural logarithm of gross domestic product per capita
(current US dollars); GDP per capita growth is the average annual growth rate in gross domestic product per capita,
both averaged over 2006-2014. Inflation equals the average annual inflation rate (GDP deflator) over 2006-2014.
See the Appendix Table A1 for more detailed variable definitions and data sources. P-values calculated using
heteroskedasticity robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. *,**, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5%,

Table 6 Slave exports and mistrust in financial institutions, household-level analyses
This table reports Probit regression results of household mistrust in financial institutions on historical slave exports.
We use the full sample in columns 1-2, and subsamples based on the level of education in columns 3-6. The
dependent variable, Mistrust in financial institutions, equals to one if a respondent has no trust in banks or other
financial institutions, and zero otherwise. The key explanatory variable, Slave exports, is from Nunn (2008) and
equals the natural logarithm of the total number of slaves exported from each country between 1400 and 1900
normalized by land area. Individual controls include a gender indicator, age, age squared, three respondent
education fixed effects (the omit group: education (completed tertiary or more)), and five household income level
fixed effects (the omit group: Income (richest 20%)). French legal origin is an indicator that equals one if the
commercial code of a country is French Commercial Code, and zero otherwise. Latitude equals the logarithm of the
absolute distance between each country and the equator. Independence equals 2006 minus a country’s first year of
independence. Culture controls include percentage of population that follows (a) Catholic, (2) Muslim, and (3)
Protestant religion in 1980. GDP per capita equals the natural logarithm of gross domestic product per capita
(current US dollars); GDP per capita growth is the average annual growth rate in gross domestic product per capita,
both averaged over 2006-2014. Inflation equals the average annual inflation rate (GDP deflator) over 2006-2014.
See the Appendix Table A1 for more detailed variable definitions and data sources. P-values calculated using
heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered at the country level are reported in parentheses. *,**, and ***

Table 7 Slave exports and legal system’s effectiveness in financial contracting
This table reports OLS regression of legal system characteristics on historical slave exports. The dependent variable is Legal rights of creditors and debtors in
column 1 and 5, Strength of insolvency framework index in columns 2 and 6, Contract enforcement time and Contract enforcement cost in column 3 & 7 and 4 &
8. Specifically, Legal rights of creditors and debtors measures the degree to which collateral and bankruptcy laws protect the claims of creditor; Strength of
insolvency framework index measures the effectiveness of country’s legal system in resolving insolvency; Contract enforcement time is the logarithm of the
number of days from the moment the plaintiff in a commercial dispute decides to file the lawsuit in court until final payment. Contract enforcement cost is
recorded as the direct costs (court costs, enforcement costs and average attorney fees) a percentage of the claim value. The key explanatory variable, Slave
exports, is from Nunn (2008) and equals the natural logarithm of the total number of slaves exported from each country between 1400 and 1900 normalized by
land area. French legal origin is an indicator that equals one if the commercial code of a country is French Commercial Code, and zero otherwise. Latitude
equals the logarithm of the absolute distance between each country and the equator. Independence equals 2006 minus a country’s first year of independence.
Culture controls include percentage of population that follows (a) Catholic, (2) Muslim, and (3) Protestant religion in 1980. Macroeconomic controls include
GDP per capita, GDP per capita growth and Inflation, all averaged over 2006-2014. See the Appendix Table A1 for more detailed variable definitions and data
sources. P-values calculated using heteroskedasticity robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. *,**, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%.

institutions that accept transferable deposits, such as demand deposits

a share of GDP. Deposit money banks comprise commercial banks and other financial
institutions that accept transferable deposits, such as demand deposits
Natural logarithm of the total number of slaves exported from each country between 1400
and 1900 in the four slave trades normalized by land area
The depth of credit information index measures rules and practices affecting the
coverage, scope and accessibility of credit information available through either a credit
bureau or a credit registry. The index ranges from 0 to 8, with higher values indicating
the availability of more credit information, from either a credit bureau or a credit registry,
to facilitate lending decisions. If the credit bureau or registry is not operational or covers
less than 5% of the adult population, the score on the depth of credit information index is
0.
The number of individuals and firms listed in a credit bureau’s database as of January 1,
2014, with information on their borrowing history within the past five years, plus the
number of individuals and firms that have had no borrowing history in the past five years
but for which a lender requested a credit report from the bureau in the period between
January 2, 2013, and January 1, 2014. The number is expressed as a percentage of the
adult population (the population age 15 and above in 2013 according to the World Bank’s
World Development Indicators). A credit bureau is defined as a private firm or nonprofit
organization that maintains a database on the creditworthiness of borrowers (individuals
or firms) in the financial system and facilitates the exchange of credit information among
creditors. If no credit bureau operates, the coverage value is 0.0%.

but for which a lender requested a credit report from the registry in the period between
January 2, 2013, and January 1, 2014. The number is expressed as a percentage of the
adult population (the population age 15 and above in 2013 according to the World Bank’s
World Development Indicators). A credit registry is defined as a database that is managed
by the public sector, usually by the central bank or the superintendent of banks, and that
collects information on the creditworthiness of borrowers (individuals or firms) in the
financial system and facilitates the exchange of credit information among banks and other
regulated financial institutions. If no credit registry operates, the coverage value is 0.0%.
Measures the degree to which collateral and bankruptcy laws protect the rights of
borrowers and lenders to expand access to credit. The index includes several key
components in the Creditor rights index in Djankov, McLiesh, and Shleifer (2007), such
as secured creditors are paid first (before other creditors such as government and
employees) when a business is liquidated; or secured creditors are not subject to an
automatic stay or moratorium on enforcement procedures when a debtor enters a courtsupervised reorganization procedure. Besides creditor rights, the index also captures
several aspects of collateral laws that supposedly enhance the borrowers’ access-tofinance ability: whether certain types of assets (i.e., movable assets) are legally accepted
as collateral by financial institutions. The index of legal rights ranges from 0 to 10, with
higher value indicating stronger legal rules that facilitate private credit extended from
financial intermediaries to individuals and firms
The index comprises four components, namely commencement of proceedings,
management of debtor’s assets, reorganization proceedings and creditor participation.
Commencement of proceedings describes the availability of liquidation and
reorganization to debtors and creditors, as well as the standard used for commencement
of insolvency proceedings. Management of debtor’s assets includes whether the debtor
can continue and reject contracts during insolvency, avoid preferential and undervalued
transactions after proceedings are initiated, and the availability and seniority of postcommencement finance. Reorganization proceedings measure the extent to which
creditors' approval and content are required to proceed with a reorganization plan.
Creditor participation captures creditors' participation and legal rights in the course of
insolvency proceedings, namely the selection of insolvency representatives, approval of
the sale of substantial assets of the debtor, access financial information of the debtor, and
objection to the court decision. The index of Strength of insolvency framework ranges
from 0 to 18, with higher values suggesting greater effectiveness of a country’s legal
system in resolving insolvency.
Measures the time of resolving a commercial dispute through a local first-instance court,
