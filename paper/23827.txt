Ethnic Differences in Demographic Behavior in the United States: What Can We Learn from
Vital Statistics about Inequality?
Michael R. Haines
NBER Working Paper No. 23827
September 2017
JEL No. I14,N12
ABSTRACT
This paper looks at the fertility and mortality experience of racial and ethnic groups in the United
States from the early 20th century to the present. The first part consist of a description and
critique of the racial and ethnic categories used in the federal census and in the published vital
statistics. The second part looks at these two dimensions of demographic behavior. There has
been both absolute and relative convergence of fertility across groups. It has been of relatively
recent origin and has been due, in large part, to stable birth rates for the majority white population
combined with declining birth rates for blacks and the Asian-origin, Hispanic-origin, and
American Indian populations. This has not been true for mortality. The black population has
experienced absolute convergence but relative deterioration in mortality (neonatal and infant
mortality, maternal mortality, expectation of life at birth, and age-adjusted death rates), in
contrast to the American Indian and Asian-origin populations. The Asian-origin population
actually now has age-adjusted death rates significantly lower than those for the white population.
The disadvantaged condition of the black population and the deteriorating social safety net are the
likely origins of this outcome. This is a clear indication of relative inequality, as the black
population is not sharing as much in the mortality improvements in recent decades.

THE CONCEPTS OF RACE AND ETHNICITY IN THE UNITED STATES CENSUS AND
VITAL STATISTICS
The fascination of Americans with race, ethnicity, and counting have always come together
in the census. From the earliest census's division of the population into three groups to the 63
ethnic categories in Census 2000, the census has both reflected social realities and changes and
affected our perceptions of them.1 This paper summarizes the most recent estimates of trends in
population, births, deaths, and infant deaths for most ethnic categories throughout American
history. It is meant to serve as a reference about national ethnic trends from 1790 through 2000.
Perhaps the most striking patterns show that, while ethnic group behavior has largely converged
in fertility and marriage patterns, African-Americans continue to be markedly less healthy than
whites or Asian-Americans.
The issue of measuring and analyzing racial and ethnic differences in population
characteristics and vital processes has long been a feature of demography in the United States.
The federal census has been collecting data on race since the first census of 1790, though that
census merely divided the population into free whites, all other free persons, and slaves. The
origin of this was in the Constitution itself which specified in Article I, Section 2 that the House
of Representatives was to be apportioned “by adding to the whole Number of free Persons,
including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three
fifths of all other persons.” The “three fifths compromise” allowed slave states to count three
1

It should be strongly emphasized that the concept of race is a social one
with no implication of a biological or genetic significance of component. For a
detailed discussion of racial and ethnic classifications in the United States Census,
see Lee (1993) for the 1890-1990 period, Edmonston and Schultze (1995, ch. 7) for the
1850 to 1990 period, and Anderson and Fienberg (1999, ch. 8) for the entire range of
the federal census.

fifths of their (disenfranchised and thus non-voting) slave populations for the purposes of
Congressional representation. This distinction continued up to 1810, when the terms “colored
persons” and “Indians not taxed” first appeared. In 1820, the free colored and slave populations
were explicitly classified by age and sex. Since slaves were only persons of sub-Saharan African
descent, no further racial distinction was used. Also, a category of “foreigners not naturalized”
was given (and used again in 1830). This distinction continued up through 1850. In 1860, the
categories of “Asiatics,” “Civilized Indians,” and “Half-Breeds” were added for some states.2 In
addition, in 1850, 1860, and 1870, the instruction was added to make a distinction between
blacks and mulattos, though precisely how this was to be done was left unclear.3 A listing of the
racial categories used in the U.S. censuses from 1790 to 1990 is provided in Appendix Tables A1 and A-2.
The question of nativity was not fully addressed until the census of 1850, the first census to
enumerate each individual (i.e., a nominal census). The previous six censuses had been
enumerations by the name of head of household with summary categories of persons by age, sex,
and race. As mentioned, the 1820 and 1830 censuses had questions about “foreigners not
naturalized,” but the 1850 census asked a question about each person’s place of birth – state
within the United States if native born and country of birth if foreign born. This has continued
up to the present. In 1870, questions were added about the nativity of the person’s father and

2

Asiatics (likely almost all Chinese) were tabulated only for California,
while the ambiguous category of “Half-Breeds” was used only for Wisconsin and New
Mexico. “Civilized Indians” were those American Indian people living in regular
domiciles in areas subject to enumeration.

mother, although initially it was only native or foreign born. For the censuses of 1880 to 1970,
questions were asked about the detailed nativity of the father and mother (state within the United
States, country if abroad), although these were only for samples for 1940-1970.4 With these
questions, it was possible to tabulate the population by nativity. This was extensively done with
a major distinction being made between the native white and the foreign-born white populations.
Later categories were created for native white of native parentage and native white of foreign or
mixed parentage. After 1970, however, the nativity of parents was no longer a question.
Some additional questions were added at various points in time that shed light on ethnicity.
For example, a question on mother tongue as inserted in the censuses of 1910-1930 and again in
1960 and 1970 (for samples). Language spoken was also asked in 1910. This has been useful,
for example, in analyzing some subgroups such as the Yiddish-speaking Jewish population) for
which separate identification is otherwise difficult or impossible. (See, for example, Condran and
Kramerow, 1991.) For immigrants, the number of years in the United States in 1900-1920 and
again for 1970-1990. The ambiguous and difficult question on “ancestry” was first asked in 1980
and was repeated in 1990 and 2000. It is purely self identification and difficult to interpret.
The question of race has undergone a number of changes over time. At the 1870 census,
slavery had legally ceased to exist in the United States, and the non-white population was then
divided into “colored” (African American), “civilized Indians,” Chinese, and Japanese. This

4

Sampling began in 1940 in which everyone was enumerated on the main form and
then persons on the “sample lines” were asked supplementary questions. The same
procedure was repeated in 1950. 25% of persons were asked to answer additional
questions in 1960 by the enumerator. In 1970, the first true self-enumerating census,
a variety of different sample groups were asked to answer additional questions. In
1980, the practice of short and long forms began, with everyone enumerated at least on
the short form. When enumerators were used, they were instructed to allow respondents
to self identify race (which, or course, would occur with self enumeration).

4

taxonomy was continued in 1880, but in 1890 the black population was divided into blacks,
mulattos, quadroons, and octoroons (see Appendix Table A-2). A simpler classification was
restored in 1900, but the question on mulattos was asked again in 1910 and 1920. Thereafter, the
black population was identified as “Negro” or, from 1970, also as black. From 1910, the number
of categories for other groups has proliferated, as Table A-1 shows. In 1930, a decision was
made to reclassify Mexicans as non-white, but that decision was reversed in the 1930s.
Consequently, the 1940 census retabulated the population from 1930 with Mexicans placed
among whites and published these results along with the 1940 tabulations. The 1990 census had
16 racial categories to choose from, including a residual category of “Other race.”
The detailed tabulation of race, nativity, and ethnicity in the published volumes (for example
by age and sex for geographic subunits) closely followed the official categories up to 1860,
although detailed tabulations of the native- and foreign-born populations by age, sex, and race
did not appear until 1870. Tabulations of the population by age, sex, race, and nativity at least
for states then have been published up through the present, although the non-white population
has sometimes been aggregated together (e.g., 1940-1960). For 1880, all non-white groups were
placed together for the tables in a group called “colored.” From 1870 to 1970, there was a
distinction of the native-born and foreign-born white population, though for 1950-1970 it was
generated from one of the samples. More recently (1980 and 1990), the distinction of nativity by
race has been largely dropped. The current standard broad categories are: White; Black or
African American; American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian; and Native Hawaiian or Pacific
Islander. These categories were established by the Office of Management and Budget in 1977 in

5

Statistical Policy Directive 15 and modified in 1997.5 There are also two questions now on
ethnicity: Hispanic or Latino, and Non-Hispanic or Non-Latino.
The identification of race is now self identification, which goes along with self enumeration
(in effect since 1970). Some combination of self identification and enumerator identification was
used in 1960. Before 1960 the judgement was left to the enumerator’s observation. Persons of
mixed white and another race were usually identified with the other race. Physical appearance
was likely very important. Beginning with the census of 2000, multiple race categories were
created to allow individuals to identify as more than one race. The category of “Two or More
Races” was 2.9% of the population in 2000 and 2.4% in 2010 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2011).
This has created problems for the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), the agency
responsible for collecting vital statistics data from the states. Birth, death, marriage and divorce
data come mostly in the form of the four original OMB categories. As a consequence the NCHS
has had to bridge the census race categories to create comparable denominators for rates.
(Ingram, et. al., 2003). These are the populations used in the calculations here.
The separate enumeration and tabulation of the Hispanic population began in 1970, although
the category “Mexican” had been given as an answer to the question on race or color in 1930.
Before 1970, it is possible to identify a large portion of the Hispanic-origin population by looking
at questions on place of birth, parent’s place of birth, mother tongue or language, and (when
available in the IPUMS samples) surname. These were used by Gratton and Gutmann (2000) to
make their estimates of the size and composition of the Hispanic-origin population (see Table 2).
5

The official OMB (Office of Management and Budget) categories from 1977 to
the present are now: White; Black or African American; American Indian or Alaska
Native; and Asian or Pacific Islander. Census data for 1980 and 1990 and most recent
vital statistics data are categorized this way.

6

Since 1970, specific questions have been asked about Spanish or Hispanic origin or descent.
These are described in Appendix Table A-3. Unfortunately, Hispanic origin overlaps other racial
categories, and so now there is a further division of the Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations
by the OMB categories (white, black or African American, American Indian and Alaskan native,
Asian, Hawaiian native or Pacific islander). A considerable amount of tabulation has been done
in recent censuses for the Hispanic-origin population.
Citizenship status is a related inquiry. It was first asked in 1900 (citizen (assumed as blank),
naturalized, applied for first papers, and alien) and has been included in the census since then
with the exception of 1960.6 In 1980, a confusing question on ancestry was introduced. It is
wholly self identified and allows for multiple responses. The question certainly does not
describe strict cultural or geographic categories and thus far seems to have had limited value for
demographic and social science research.
The categories of race and ethnicity are still in a state of flux, having been changed as recently
as 1987. They, and the politicized process of determining the categories, were seriously critiqued
by William Petersen:
Indeed, the Census Bureau can do little or nothing to alter the political context of ethnic
counts, nor can it escape from fiscal control by a Congress sensitive to racial and ethnic
blocs. What it can do, for instance, is not to repeat the egregious error of inviting
representatives of special interests to act as formal consultants supervising its operations.
Instead of seeking to avoid pressure from ethnic blocs to revise definitions or
enumeration procedures, the bureau invited the participation of blacks, Hispanics,
Indians, and others, each of whom wanted to shape the process to its political advantage.
These committees were of a type different from those made up of statisticians or typical
users of census data, for the members were generally chosen less for their knowledge than
for their ideology. Giving aspirant leaders this kind of quasi-official status aggravated the
disadvantages of the procedure already established–the delineation of ethnic categories by

6

The citizenship question in 1970 was in the 5% sample.

7

self-identification combined with promotional campaigns that stressed the monetary
advantages of larger counts, thus encouraging the creation of “instant” members of the
various categories. (Petersen, 1987, p. 233.)
Presently, it is explicitly stated by the Census Bureau that the concept of race, whose
categories are intended to be mutually exclusive, is not supposed to reflect any biological or
anthropological definitions. That is laudable, but the fact remains that rather arbitrary changes
over time have made secular comparisons more difficult. An example of the difficulty is the
group of Hispanic origin population which is seen as an ethnic, and not a racial, group. Within
the Hispanic origin population there are then racial groups. The change to self identification has
further complicated matters. This is undoubtedly some improvement over enumerator
identification, but further muddying the waters. For example, the American Indian population of
the United States grew by 5.4% per annum in the 1970s, 3.6% per annum in the 1980s, and 7.4%
per annum in the 1990s.7 Since this was a group for which net in-migration was likely negligible,
such rapid growth would indicate significant amounts of self-redefinition. Finally, the category
of “Other” now includes persons who identify with no racial category, often persons of mixed
race. We do the best we can with what we have, but the limitations must be kept in mind.
The vital statistics of the United States suffer from many of the same issues. Systematic
collection of vital statistics at the federal level only began with the creation of the Death
Registration Area in 1900 (comprising at first only ten states and the District of Columbia) and
the Birth Registration Area in 1915 (also initially comprising only ten states and the District of
Columbia). Both were complete only in 1933 with the admission of Texas. A Marriage
7

The term “American Indian” is used here in preference to the term “Native
American” because the latter is not properly descriptive of the origins of that group.
The Canadian official statistics have used, for example, the terms “aboriginal” and
“first inhabitants”.

8

Registration Area was only set up in 1957, and a Divorce Registration Area was only created in
1958, although national estimates exist for the period since 1920. The Marriage and Divorce
Registration Areas are still not complete. Birth and death data were reported by race (with a few
exceptions), while marriages and divorces were often not. Through the 20th century, much of the
published reporting was done for whites and non-whites (often referred to as “All Others”).
Separate reporting for blacks began in 1960 and for the American Indian and Asian or Pacific
Islander populations in 1980.
RACIAL AND ETHNIC DIFFERENCES IN DEMOGRAPHIC BEHAVIOR
Tables 1 provides information on the size, composition, and growth of the American
population by race and ethnicity. An overview of fertility and mortality for the white and black
population since 1800 is given in Table 3. Fertility is described in detail in Tables 3 and 4 and
mortality in Tables 5 to 7. All the tables exhibit comparisons of differentials of population,
fertility and mortality by race and ethnicity.
POPULATION SIZE AND COMPOSITION
Table 1 provides information on the size and racial composition of the American population
since 1790. The second panel has the percentage breakdown from 1790 to 2010 by race. Note
that the category “Hispanic” is not part of the racial categorization and should be looked at
separately.
At the beginning of the Republic, about four-fifths of the population was white and one-fifth
black, most of whom were slaves in the South. In 1820, the first census to distinguish slaves
from free blacks, the free black population was 13% of the total black population. This
proportion actually fell to about 11% in 1860, largely due to the higher fertility of slaves relative

9

to free blacks.. The share on the non-white population began to decline from the early 19th
century to about 1930, when it stabilized for several decades. This decline was caused by the
significant influx of migrants to the United States, most of whom were white Europeans.
Between 1819 (the first date for which we have regular immigrant entry statistics) and 1920,
approximately 34 million migrants entered the United States. This total was about 64 million
through 1998. (Carter, et. al, 2006, series Ad1-2.)
From about 1950 the white share of total population began to decline such that it fell from
about 90% to about 80% in the 2010 census. Although the share of the black population in the
total has risen in recent decades, much of the increased share for non-whites has been in the
category of “Other Races,” especially Asians, who were about 45% of that group, and the
American Indian population (about 15% of “Other Races”). The Hispanic population is
comprised of various races and is considered an ethnic and not a racial category (see Table 1).
That population has grown at rates of 4% to 6% per year in the decades since 1940. A great deal
of that growth more recently has been from persons of Mexican origin, who now comprise about
64% of the Hispanic origin population in 2012. The other important components are those of
Puerto Rican origin and Cuban origin (9.2% and 3.5% of the Hispanic population in 2012,
respectively), with a very rapidly growing group from other areas of Central and South America.
The implications for the demography of minorities is clear and well known. The United States
if becoming less of nation of white persons of European origin and more a racially and ethnically
diverse group. In recent years, the Asian and Hispanic populations have shown the most rapid
growth (Table 1, lower panel). The exceptionally fast growth of the American Indian population
is due to ethnic re-identification. Given the present immigration laws, policies, and practices in

10

place and the attraction of the United States labor market, this trend shows every indication of
continuing.
FERTILITY
Evidence on fertility by race is presented in Tables 2 to 4. The measures selected are the crude
birth rate, the general fertility rate, the total fertility rate, and the census-based child-woman
ratio.8 A notable feature of fertility in the early Republic was the large family size of white
women, who exhibited a crude birth rate of about 55 in 1800 which implies a total fertility rate of
about 7 live births per woman in her reproductive lifetime. Information for the black population
does not become available until 1820 in the form of a child-woman ratio (children aged 0-4 per
1,000 women aged 20-44) and not until the 1850s for the crude birth rate and the total fertility
rate.9 It is apparent that white fertility declined fairly steadily from 1800 until the onset of the
“Baby Boom” in the 1940s, while black fertility remained rather stable up to the Civil War. This
is not too surprising, since the incentives under slavery were for the profitable reproduction of the
slave population. Nonetheless, after about 1880, the fertility of the black population began to
decline in parallel with that for whites.
Table 2 shows that the total fertility rates for blacks and whites did not begin to converge until
about 1880, when the black TFR was over 70% higher than the white TFR. There was then a
convergence up until about 1920, followed by some widening of the gap to about a 20-40%
8

It is possible to reconstruct fertility and mortality rates back into the
19th century. Table 3 reports some of the results currently available. Improved
estimates of the fertility of the white population back to 1850 will soon be available
using own-children methods with the Integrated Public Use Micro Samples (IPUMS) of the
censuses of 1850-1880, being conducted by J. David Hacker.
9

Note that the rates in Table 3 are for “All Other” (i.e., non-whites) for
1920-1970 for the crude birth rate and for 1940-1990 for the total fertility rate.
But much of the non-white population (over 90%) was black during those decades.

11

higher TFR among black women (about one birth per woman). Since about 1990, however, the
gap has begun to close to only a 6.4% higher TFR in 1998, amounting to only about .1 birth per
woman. The decline since the end of the “Baby Boom” in the early 1960s has been significant,
though much of it occurred in the 1990s. This may be seen graphically in Figure 1. Some of this
has come from declines in birth rates among very young black women. For instance, birth rates
for black women aged 15-17 declined from 82.3 per 1,000 in 1990 to 22.0 in 2012 (and from
152.9 to 74.4 for black women aged 18-19). (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2013, Table 4). But
there has been some decline in age-specific rates at older ages as well.
From 1980 onwards we have vital statistics for the American Indian and the Asian
populations, and from 1989 onwards for the Hispanic-origin population. In all these cases,
convergence has been taking place. Indeed, for the Asian and Pacific Islander group, the TFR’s
are now below those for the white population, and those for the Hispanic-origin population are
very close (Table 4). For the American Indian and Asian populations the convergence was taking
place from the early 1980s. Table 4 provides some idea of the origins of all this. White TFR’s
stabilized in the 1970s and began a slow increase to above 2 per woman (or 2,000 per 1,000
women) in the late 1990s. The increased representation of the somewhat higher fertility Hispanic
women in the white population was certainly playing some role. Simultaneously, the TFR’s for
black, American Indian, and Asian women declined a bit. Finally, the fertility of Hispanic-origin
women remain roughly stable from 1989. What is occurring is that all groups seem to be
converging on about 2 births per woman.
As to why minorities should have different fertility is an open question. If, as in the case of
blacks, Hispanics, and the American Indian population, a higher proportion have lower incomes,

12

less wealth, less stable employment, and less education than the majority white population.
These are factors often associated with higher birth rates. But there is also the “Minority Group
Status Hypothesis,” which conjectures that minority groups strive to improve their status. (Bean
and Marcum, 1978.) This might be achieved using the help of more children, hence leading to
higher birth rates. But there is the competing view that the desire to be upwardly mobile might
spur more efforts toward family limitation to conserve family resources and concentrate on more
human capital per child. Thus the predicted direction of the differential is unclear. The
American case would seem to support the view that lower socioeconomic status has had the
effect of raising fertility, but that these effects are diminishing over time, as birth rates come
close to replacement levels.
MORTALITY
Tables 5 through 7 provide measures of mortality for the racial and ethnic groups for which
reporting was available over longer periods of time. Thus, the breakdown is for whites, all nonwhites (“All Others”), and blacks. In the case of Hispanics, some data are available for infant
mortality since 1989. The period covered is 1850 to 2014. Table 5 contains data on the neonatal
mortality rate (deaths at 0-28 days of life per 1,000 live births), the infant mortality rate (deaths in
the entire first year of life per 1,000 live births), and the maternal mortality rate (deaths from
childbirth and its complications per 100,000 live births). Table 6 presents the expectation of life
at birth by sex and for both sexes combined. Table 7 provides data on age-adjusted death rates
by race and sex from 1900 to 2014. The data in Table 5 for 1915 to 1932 are for the current
Birth Registration Area only. Similarly, the data in Tables 6 and 7 for 1900 to 1932 are for are
also for the Death Registration Area. The relationships to the white population are given in

13

Table 5 for the neonatal mortality rate, the infant mortality rate, and the maternal mortality rate,
Table 6 for the expectation of life at birth, and Table 7 for age-adjusted death rates.
The picture for mortality is different from that for fertility. It is not one of relative
convergence. If anything, there has been substantial relative divergence, although there has been
much closing of the white/non-white gap in terms of absolute numbers of deaths per number of
live births of in years of expectation of life. The difference in the number of infant deaths per
1,000 live births between whites and blacks has been reduced from 41 in 1900 and 46 in 1910 to
6.0 in 2014.. The reduction has been even greater for all non-whites (to 3.6 infant deaths in
2014). But the relative situation has deteriorated. Black infant mortality was in a more favorable
circumstance relative to white infant mortality in 1900 (42% higher) than at any subsequent date.
In 2014 it was 220% higher. The more favorable showing of entire group of non-whites reflects
the more favorable showing of the Asian and Pacific Islander population. A graphic depiction of
this relative divergence is presented in Figure 2.
The serious disadvantage of the nonwhite population is traceable significantly to their low
average levels of education and income. This is true especially for blacks but also for the
American Indian population with an infnant mortality rate of 7.6 in 2013 (NCHS, 2016b, Table
10). It does not hold for the Hispanic population with an infant mortality rate of 5.0 in 2013.
This is now know as the Hispanic mortality paradox. The Asian/Pacific Islander population as a
whole does not suffer from this mortality penalty with an infant mortality rate of 4.1 in 2013..
On two counts, American society has come up short – it has failed to provide adequate health and
medical care to its poor, and it has also failed to raise the level of living of many of its poor. In
2012, the United States ranked 259h in the world in infant mortality (NCHS, 2016b, Table 13). A

14

wealthy and technologically advanced society surely can and should do more. As Antonovsky
and Bernstein (1977, p. 459) note: “Low social class per se does not cause high infant
mortality...however,...social class does subsume a large set of more directly causative biological
and behavioral variables.” Some of those causative variables may be amenable to direct policy
intervention (e.g., universal child immunization programs), but some may be address by more
general improvements in the living standards of the society, particularly among its poor.
The record for neonatal mortality was about the same as for overall infant mortality. Similarly,
maternal mortality showed deterioration from the early 20th century up to the early 1960s and
then a modest improvement. But maternal mortality is still over 2.6 times higher for the black
population than the white population (2007), despite a reduction in the absolute number of
maternal deaths per 100,000 live births from 1,000 per 100,000 live births in 1933 (for all nonwhites) to for blacks in 200. The relative difference seems to have no trend at present.
Table 6 demonstrates that overall black and non-white mortality, as measured by the
expectation of life at birth, was higher throughout the period 1900 to 2014. Table 6 (Lower
panel) gives the relative deficit of the total non-white and black expectations of life at birth
annually since 1900. Up to 1933, those estimates are for the current Death Registration Area.
The upper panel of Table 6 contain estimates for 1900 and 1910 for the whole nation based on
indirect estimation from the samples of the microdata from the 1900 and 1910 U.S. censuses.
(Haines, 1998; Preston and Haines, 1991; Haines and Preston, 1997.) Since those are estimates
for the whole population, rather than the rather restricted sample of the early Death Registration
Area, those estimates are to be preferred to the annual estimates in the lower panel. If those
benchmarks are used, the picture for the black population is somewhat more favorable, since in

1900 and 1910 the national black population was more rural than in the Death Registration Area,
which afforded some degree of protection. The DRA of 1900 had less than 5% of the nation's
African American population, and, of that, 82-83% was urban. The national average percentage
urban of the black population was 20% in 1900 and 27% in 1910. (Haines and Preston, 1997.)
Although by those standards, real progress has been made, nonetheless, in 1998, black males still
had e(0) 6.9 years below those for white males. The number for black females was a deficit of
5.2 years. These numbers in 1900 had only been 8.1 and 7.4 years, respectively.
Table 7 provides data on age-adjusted death rates by race and sex from 1900 to 2014. (This
table uses the new 2000 age structure standard, much different from the 1940 age structure
standard.) These are also for the Death Registration Area up through 1932. The lower panel
gives the ratios of these age-adjusted death rates to those for the majority white population. The
record there would indicate only modest progress for the African American population (the
overwhelming share of the “All Other” category until the 1950s). In 2014, the age-adjusted death
rate for blacks stood 17% higher than for whites. Interestingly, for the American Indian and
Asian populations, the outcomes are better. Indeed, the younger populations of those groups do
relatively well, with American Indians closer to the white rates (82% of the white rate) and the
Asian and Pacific Islander origin population substantially below the white population (53% of
the white rates). Overall, however, the record for the substantilal black minority mortality is less
than admirable.
The source of this is to be found in disadvantaged socioeconomic status not ameliorated by
corrective social policies. No extensive national-level information on income for individuals
exists before 1939. The first census to ask a question on income was the U.S. Census of

16

Population of 1940, and for that census the question was only about wage and salary income for
1939, excluding proprietary, self-employment, and property income. Much of what we know
about American incomes by race originates in the Current Population Survey, conducted monthly
by the Bureau of the Census since 1947, particularly aimed at labor force issues such as
unemployment and income.10 One partial earlier piece of evidence may be gleaned from a
Bureau of Labor Statistics survey taken in 1917-1919 of 12,817 families in 99 urban centers in
42 states of the United States for purposes of studying the cost of living (United States Bureau of
Labor Statistics, 1924). In that study, white family heads had average earnings of $1,352 while
colored family heads had average earnings of $979 (or 72% of that of whites).11 For the period
1947 to 1970, families headed by non-whites had median incomes of 51-64% of those for whites
heading families. The range was 61-78% for unrelated individuals. In the case of families, there
appeared to have been an improvement over time in both real income (in constant 1967 dollars)
and in relation to income for white-headed families. This was not, however, true for unrelated
individuals, who did experience a rise in real income but showed no trend relative to whites.
(U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1975, Series G 189-204.) By 1998, the median income of blackhead households was 62% of that of white households (in contrast to 113% for Asian-headed

10

Originally in 1947, the Survey covered a representative sample of
approximately 21,000 interviewed households in areas throughout the United States.
This sample was increased to approximately 35,000 in May 1956 and to approximately
50,000 in January 1967. It is subject to sampling error. At present, about 50,000
occupied households are eligible for interview each month. Of these, about 4 to 5
percent are, for a variety of reasons, unavailable for the interview. Estimates of
population characteristics based on the CPS will not agree with counts based on the
census because the CPS and the census use different sampling procedures, different
samples, and different procedures for racial groups, the Hispanic population, and
other topics.

households and 69% for Hispanic-headed households). (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2000, Table
737.) In terms of income distribution, the Current Population survey also reveals that in 1947
46% of families with white head had income below $3,000, while this was 81% for families with
a non-white head. This had improved to 7.5% for whites and 20.1% for non-whites by 1970,
both because of rising real and nominal incomes; but the gap was still substantial. Similar results
obtain for unrelated individuals. In 1947, 61% of whites had incomes under $1,500, while 79%
of non-whites were in that situation. By 1970, this was 21% for whites but still 35% for nonwhites. (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1975, Series G 16-30.) In 2009, 12.3% of the white
population fell below the official poverty threshold, while this was 25.8% for the black
population and 25.3% for the Hispanic population. (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2011, Table
711.)
Overall, the disadvantaged status of non-whites generally, and blacks in particular, are
demonstrated by these income disparities, Since socioeconomic well-being has an important
effect on expectation of life, infant mortality, and death rates overall, it is not surprising that the
relative disadvantage of the black population in mortality has not disappeared.
CONCLUDING COMMENTS
Examining data from a variety of statistical sources on the demography of racial and ethnic
groups in the United States to the present reveals some interesting results. Taking into account
the changing definitions and boundaries of race and ethnicity in official federal statistics, the has
been both relative and absolute convergence in fertility behavior across groups. It has been of
relatively recent origin and has been due, in large part, to stable (or even slightly increasing) birth
rates for the majority white population combined with declining birth rates for blacks and the

18

Asian-origin, Hispanic-origin, and American Indian populations.
This has not been true for mortality, however. The black population has experienced absolute
convergence but relative deterioration in mortality (neonatal and infant mortality, maternal
mortality, expectation of life at birth, and age-adjusted death rates), in contrast to the American
Indian and Asian-origin populations. The Asian-origin population actually now has age-adjusted
death rates significantly lower than those for the white population.12 The disadvantaged
condition of the black population and the deteriorating social safety net are the likely origins of
this outcome.
The lessons to be learned are not that the American population is becoming more
homogeneous. On the contrary, it is seemingly more heterogeneous. But it seems that groups are
responding in similar ways to social trends and constraints. The most troubling result is the
relative deterioration of the mortality situation for the black population. This is clearly an issue
which warrants the most serious attention by policy makers.

12

The age-adjusted death rates for the Hispanic-origin population are
available only since 1997. For the 1997-2014 period, those rates were lower than
those for the white population (at about 80%).

\1 Based on estimated total live births per 1,000 population for specified group. Based on a 50-percent sample of births for 1951-1954, 1956-1966,
and 1968-1970; on 20- to 50-percent sample for 1967. Prior to 1959, births adjusted for underregistration; thereafter, registered live births.
Rates by race are by race of child before 1980 and by race of mother rom 1980 onwards. GFR is computed by relating total births, regardless of
age of mother, to women aged 15-44 years.
\2 Includes Alaska.

\1 Total fertility rates are the sums of birth rates, by age of mother, multiplied by 5. Birth rates are live births
per 1,000 women in specified group. Prior to 1959, births adjusted for underregistration; therefore, registered
live births. Based on 50-percent sample of births for 1951-1954, 1956-1966, and 1968-1970; a 20 to 50 percent
sample for 1967. Total fertility rates are the sums of birth rates by 5-year age groups of mothers multiplied by 5.
Birth rates are live births per 1000 women in the specified group. Beginning 1970 excludes births to
nonresidents of US. Based on 100 percent of births in selected states and on a 50 percent sample in all other
states for 1972-1984. Based on 59 percent sample of births for 1960-1966, 1968-1971. 1967 is based on a 20
to 50 percent sample of births.

(a) The categories are given in the order in which whey appeared on the schedule or in the enumerator’s instructions. The abbreviations are those
that were to be used on the schedules. W= white; B=black; M=Mulatto; Neg=Negro; I, In, Ind., or Indian (Amer)=Indian (American Indian); C, Ch,
or Chi=Chinese; Jp or Jap=Japanese; Ot=other; Fil=Filipino; Hin=Hindu (South Asian Indian); Kor=Korean; Mex=Mexican; API= Asian or Pacific
Islander.
(b) In 1850 and 1860, on the schedule for free persons, the instructions to the enumerators were “in all cases where the person is White leave the
space blank in the column marked ‘Color’.” For the slave schedule, the listed categories were “B” and “M”.
(c) Although a category for American Indian people was not listed on the census form, the enumerator’s instructions for 1860 were: “5. Indians –

Indians not taxed were not to be enumerated. The families of Indians who have renounced tribal rule, and who under State or Territorial laws
exercise the rights of citizens, are to be enumerated. In all such cases write “Ind.” opposite their names, in column 6, under the heading “Color”....9.
Color. Under heading 6, entitled “Color,” in all cases where the person is white leave the space blank; in all cases where the person is black with
admixture insert the letter “B”; if a mulatto, or of mixed blood, write “M”; if an Indian, write “Ind.” It is very desirable to have these instructions
carefully observed.”

(a) The census asked a specific question on “Spanish origin or descent” in 1970 on the 5% sample as a second part of a sample question on
birthplace. In 1980, the question on “Spanish/Hispanic Origin or Descent” appeared on the short form (100% sample). Before 1970, members of the
Hispanic origin population could be identified by a combination of questions on palce of birth, place of birth of parents, and mother tongue. In the
1930 census only, the category “Mexican” was a separate category for answers to the question on “Color or Race.” See Gratton and Gutmann (2000).
(b) This question appeared in the 1970 5% sample long form.
