Are CEOs Different? Characteristics of Top Managers
Steven N. Kaplan and Morten Sorensen
NBER Working Paper No. 23832
September 2017
JEL No. G34,J16,M12,M5,M51
ABSTRACT
We use a dataset of over 2,600 executive assessments to study thirty individual characteristics of
candidates for top executive positions – CEO, CFO, COO and others. We classify the thirty
candidate characteristics with four primary factors: general ability, execution vs. interpersonal,
charisma vs. analytic, and strategic vs. managerial. CEO candidates tend to score higher on these
factors; CFO candidates score lower. Conditional on being a candidate, executives with greater
interpersonal skills are more likely to be hired, suggesting that such skills are important in the
selection process. Scores on the four factors also predict future career progression. Non-CEO
candidates who score higher on the four factors are subsequently more likely to become CEOs.
The patterns are qualitatively similar for public, private equity and venture capital owned
companies. We do not find economically large differences in the four factors for men and
women. Women, however, are subsequently less likely to become CEOs, holding the four factors
constant.

Large management, popular and anecdotal literatures describe the traits, skills and
abilities that characterize CEOs and other leaders. These literatures imply that CEOs differ from
other executives. They implicitly, and often explicitly, suggest what types of activities aspiring
CEOs should undertake in order to increase their chances of becoming a CEO. For example,
Collins (2001) argues that great CEOs have unwavering resolve and are compellingly modest.
George et al. (2007) argues that leaders should “demonstrate a passion for their purpose, …
establish long-term, meaningful relationships and have the self-discipline to get results.”
Waldman and Yammarino (1999) argue that CEOs need to be charismatic. Ones and Dilchert
(2009) summarize the industrial psychology literature as finding that successful executives have
high cognitive ability, conscientiousness / achievement and extraversion / assertiveness. Pfeffer
(2015 and 2016), on the other hand, generally criticizes these kinds of suggestions as “leadership
BS,” not describing what leaders and CEOs actually are like, and he argues that “leadership is
not about winning popularity contests or being the most beloved person in a social organization.”
Because it is difficult to obtain detailed systematic information on a meaningful sample
of CEOs, there are few empirical studies of this topic. The management literature generally
relies on publicly observable measures, such as job tenure, college attended and career path (see
Hambrick 2007) or studies smaller, specific samples of CEOs (e.g., 95 credit union CEOs in
Colbert et al. 2014, or 32 technology firms in O’Reilley et al. 2014).1
Adams et al. (2016), Kaplan, Klebanov and Sorensen (2012) (henceforth “KKS”),
Palaiou and Furnham (2015) and Green et al. (2015) are recent exceptions. Adams et al. use
cognitive and non-cognitive test data measured at age 18 on a large sample of Swedish men.

(2013), Ulrich et al. (2009), and Yammarino et al. (2005).

They find that CEOs score higher on the cognitive and particularly non-cognitive tests than other
high-caliber professionals – doctors and lawyers. Furthermore, larger companies hire the more
talented CEOs. KKS (2012) use detailed personality assessments to study 316 candidates for
CEO roles in venture capital and private equity-funded companies. Using this data, they classify
the candidates by two factors: the first factor captures each candidate’s general ability; the
second factor describes the candidate as being either more execution oriented or having greater
interpersonal skills. In their sample, they find that CEOs with greater general ability and,
particularly, more execution-oriented characteristics tend to be more successful CEOs. Palaiou
and Furnham (2015) study the (self-reported) personality scores of 138 CEOs and almost 8,000
other employees of UK companies administered by a psychological consulting firm. They find
that CEOs are more extraverted, more agreeable, and, particularly, less neurotic and more
conscientiousness than other employees. Green et al. (2015) use linguistic algorithms to measure
the extraversion of company executives during earnings conference calls. They find that
extraverted CFOs and CEOs earn higher salaries and extraverted CFOs are more likely to be
promoted to CEOs.
This study extends KKS (2012) by expanding the dataset to more than 2,600 assessments,
including assessments for positions other than CEO. The assessments are based on four-hour
structured interviews performed by ghSMART.2 After each interview, ghSMART produces an
assessment report with a detailed description of the candidate’s background and characteristics,
including ratings of thirty specific characteristics and abilities (see Table A-1). Most of the
assessments were completed when the candidates were considered for CEO, COO, CFO or other
top executive positions. The firms requesting the assessments include companies governed

2

Botelho et al. (forthcoming) also use the ghSMART data to study the determinants of CEO success.
2

under different ownership forms, including venture capital, private equity-owned (as in KKS),
other privately owned, and publicly traded companies. We also track the candidates’ subsequent
career paths, both to determine whether they were hired for the positions for which they were
assessed as well as whether they ultimately became top executives, particularly CEOs, of the
assessing companies or any other companies.
The dataset allows us to investigate several questions. First, to identify the main
dimensions of variation in managerial characteristics, we use factor analysis — a traditional
empirical approach in studies of personality traits (see Fabrigar et al. 1999, and Borghans et al.
2008). We find four factors that have intuitive interpretations: general ability, execution vs.
interpersonal, charisma vs. analytic, and strategic vs. managerial details. The first two factors are
similar to those found in KKS (2012).
The first factor loads positively on all assessed characteristics and appears to represent a
candidate’s overall talent. This factor can be interpreted as analogous to the general measure of
managerial talent and ability assumed by theorists such as Rosen (1981).
The second factor loads positively on Respect, Open to Criticism, Listening Skills, and
Teamwork, which reflect communication and interpersonal abilities, and it loads negatively on
Fast, Efficiency, Aggressive, Persistence, and Proactive, which describe capabilities related to
resoluteness and execution skills. Thus, this factor classifies candidates as having either greater
interpersonal or greater execution skills.
The third factor loads positively on Analytical Skills, Organization and Attention to
Detail. It loads negatively on Enthusiasm, Persuasion, Aggressive and Proactive. Hence, we
interpret this factor as classifying candidates as being either more analytical or having stronger
charisma.

3

The fourth factor loads positively on Strategic Vision, Brainpower and Creative while
loading negatively on Attention to Detail, Holds People Accountable, and Organization. We
interpret this factor as classifying candidates as having a broader and more strategic perspective
versus focusing more narrowly on details pertaining to the organization and people management.
In short, the fourth factor describes candidates as either strategic or focused on managerial
details.
Second, using the factor decomposition, we find that CEO candidates tend to have greater
general talent, greater execution ability, more charisma, and greater strategic ability. In contrast,
CFO candidates tend to have lower general talent, less charisma, and be more analytical and with
a focus on managerial details. In short, according to our classification, the characteristics of
CEO and CFO candidates are opposites.
Third, we investigate who among the assessed candidates are hired. For each type of
position (CEO, CFO, etc.), hired candidates have greater interpersonal skills than the average
assessed candidates, suggesting that such skills are important in the selection process.
Fourth, we pursue an out of sample analysis that considers who ultimately becomes a
CEO. To do this, we follow the executives who were considered for positions other than the
CEO position at the time of the assessment and see whether they subsequently become CEOs.
Among these non-CEO candidates, those who have greater general ability and more execution,
charisma, and strategic abilities are more likely to subsequently become CEOs. This result
provides external validity for our other findings. It confirms that the differences in personalities
across different positions continue to hold more generally for executive who are hired or
promoted without the involvement of ghSMART and for other companies than those in our
initial sample.

4

Fifth, our results are qualitatively similar for candidates in the three primary types of
ownership structures – public, private equity and venture capital owned – suggesting that the
results in KKS (2012) generalize from private equity-funded companies.
Sixth, we compare female and male executives. We find that there are no meaningful
differences in the four factors for men and women. Women, however, are subsequently less
likely to become CEOs, holding the four factors constant.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section I describes our data and sample. Section II
explores the main dimensions of variation in the directly measured executive characteristics and
their relation to subjective classifications. Section III considers the relation of the executive
characteristics to the executive positions. We also measure how the candidates who were
actually hired differ from all of those who were interviewed. Section IV studies the relationship
between executive characteristics and subsequent career positions. Section V concludes with a
discussion of how our results relate to the economics, management and popular literatures.

I.

Data

A.

Assessments
Like KKS (2012), we rely on a proprietary data set containing detailed assessments

performed by ghSMART, a consulting firm that focuses on assessing top management
candidates. Investors, company boards or company management teams engage ghSMART to
assess candidates both for new and existing roles. The majority of the executives are candidates
for management positions at companies funded by venture capital, growth equity, or buyout
firms. We combine growth equity and buyout funded companies into a group we call private
equity funded companies. The assessments in our sample (and interviews on which they are

5

based) were completed primarily between 2001 and 2011. With a few exceptions, the candidates
were employed and interviewing for positions in the United States and Canada.
Unlike the sample of venture capital and private equity-backed firms in KKS (2012), this
sample also contains a large number of candidates for publicly-traded and other private
companies. More importantly, the sample includes candidates evaluated for non-CEO positions.
In most of the analysis, we focus on the candidates assessed for CEO, CFO, and COO positions,
although this constitutes only about half the sample. The other half contains candidates for a
number of other executive positions. We use CXO to denote CEO, CFO, or COO positions (i.e.,
the number of CXO candidates is the union of candidates assessed for CEO, CFO, and COO
positions). We use ALL to denote all the candidates in the sample, including candidates for
positions that are neither CEO, CFO, or COO positions. Some candidates are considered for
several positions (e.g., either CEO or CFO). These candidates are included in all the categories
they are interviewed for, so the sum of CEO, CFO, and COO candidates sometimes exceeds the
number of CXO candidates.
ghSMART is not an executive recruiting firm and, therefore, does not suggest which
candidate(s) to interview for a given position. ghSMART only assesses the specific candidate(s)
under consideration. ghSMART does not receive a fee contingent on whether or not a candidate
is hired. It has no apparent incentives to deliver biased assessments. According to ghSMART,
its main objective is to provide accurate assessments to sustain its reputation and generate repeat
business. No candidate has ever refused to participate in an interview or suggested that it
presented an unreasonable burden or intrusion into the candidate’s privacy.
ghSMART’s assessments are based on four-hour structured interviews. During the

6

interview, the interviewer3 asks for specific examples of the candidate’s actions and behavior at
every previous job and life stage, starting with the candidate’s childhood and progressing
through the candidate’s education and subsequent career path. The interviewer then summarizes
the candidate's history and behavior in a 20 to 40-page report. The report is effectively a minibiography of the candidate.
In addition to the narrative, each report includes scores or ratings on thirty specific
characteristics in five general areas. These areas, defined by ghSMART, are Leadership,
Personal, Intellectual, Motivational, and Interpersonal. Table A-1 repeats Table I from KKS
(2012) and shows an excerpt from ghSMART’s internal guidelines that describe the thirty
characteristics along with the behaviors that determine their scoring.4
The reports also include information about the candidates’ educational and family
backgrounds. Reports sometimes include scores of other characteristics that are specific to the
particular company or situation. Because these characteristics are not consistently and
systematically reported, we do not include them in our analyses.
For each of the thirty characteristics, the report scores the candidate with a letter grade
from D (lowest) to A+ (highest), reflecting the extent to which the candidate’s past behavior
reflects the nature of the particular characteristic. We convert these letter grades to numerical
scores as follows. We code all grades of B or below as 1 (we combine these grades because there
are relatively few of them). We code grades of A and A+ as 4, as there are relatively few A+’s.
We code grades of B+ as 2 and grades of A- as 3. Our results are qualitatively similar under
different coding schemes.
3

The ghSMART interviewers generally hold doctoral degrees or degrees from top MBA programs, and have
worked at consulting firms (such as McKinsey & Co., Bain, and Boston Consulting Group). ghSMART reports a
high degree of consistency of assessments across interviewers. When we include interviewer fixed effects, as
indicated in the tables, the magnitude and statistical significance of the main coefficients are largely unchanged.
4
Smart and Street (2008) provide additional information and detail about ghSMART’s interviewing methodology.
7

An important concern is whether it is possible for the candidates to “game” or “fake” the
interviews by providing answers that they believe will help them be hired, even if they do not
reflect their actual personalities. As discussed in KKS (2012), there are a number of reasons why
we believe the ghSMART analyses and ratings are reliable. The assessments are formed using
the best practices from organizational psychology, including using external interviewers not selfassessments, and using extensive structured interviews rather than shorter questionnaires. In
organizational psychology, these practices have been found to produce valid assessments, which
are consistent across tests and robust to gaming and faking by the test subjects. ghSMART
charges at least $20,000 per assessment and has seen its business grow substantially, suggesting
that ghSMART customers find the assessments useful.5 Moreover, at the time the assessments
were conducted, ghSMART and the candidates would not have been aware of the factor structure
we document. Finally, it is difficult to reconcile the empirical results with significant faking. If
the assessments were uninformative, there would not be a relationship between the assessments
and subsequent career trajectory that we document in the out-of-sample analysis.
For each candidate, we code several additional variables. We note whether the candidate
is an internal candidate or an outside candidate. We note the gender of the candidate. We
consider the industry of the company and the candidate’s previous experience in this industry.
When possible, we include the size of the company. Because many of the companies are private,
it is not possible to measure size precisely. Instead, we categorize companies as either start-up,
companies with sales below $100 million, with sales between $100 million and $1 billion, and
with sales above $1 billion.
5

Additionally, albeit anecdotally, several PE firms told us that they do not make any investments without a CEO
assessment of the type ghSMART provides. While economic theory suggests that it may be rational for candidates
to attempt to misrepresent their types, economic theory also prescribes that it would be irrational for investors to rely
on such assessments if they were uninformative. Assessments also are costly: in addition to the fee charged by
ghSMART, assessments require at least four hours of a candidate’s time.
8

Research assistants performed much of the coding of the assessments. The research
assistants read the assessments and transcribed the ratings directly from the reports. After
reading the assessments, we also asked the research assistants to provide their subjective ratings
of each candidate based on the description or mini-biography in the assessments. The research
assistants rated whether the candidate appeared to be a “nice person,” “a risk taker,” an
“outgoing person” (versus a reserved one), “good at sales,” and whether the candidate had a
“narrow or broad career path.” For these ratings, we did not provide the research assistants with
any more precise guidelines or definitions.

B.

Hiring Decisions and Subsequent Career Trajectory
We code the candidate’s subsequent career path following the interview, including

whether the candidate was hired for the position for which he or she was assessed and the
candidate’s subsequent managerial positions. We determine the subsequent career path primarily
from public sources. We rely on LinkedIn, which has extremely good coverage of corporate
executives. We also use CapitalIQ, Zoominfo.com, LexisNexis, and general internet searches.
In a few cases, we use information from KKS (2012) obtained from surveying some of the
buyout and venture capital firms that engaged ghSMART to assess CEO candidates.

C.

Sample Descriptive Statistics
Table 1 shows the distribution of candidates in the sample. Panel A shows that the

sample contains more than 2,600 assessments, taking place between 2000 and 2013, with over
2,400 occurring between 2001 and 2011.

9

Panel B presents additional information about the candidates. About 10% of the
candidates are female. Roughly 5% of CEO candidates, 8% of CFO candidates, and 8% of COO
candidates are female.
The average candidate has worked for his or her current company for an average of 4.9
years out of an average career of 23.5 years. Almost 60% of the candidates are outsiders, i.e.,
they did not work for the company for which they were being assessed. The average candidate
has worked for 4.6 companies during his or her career up to the time of the assessment. Almost
60% of the assessed candidates were subsequently hired for or retained the position for which
they were assessed.
Table 2 presents more information on the assessed candidates. Panel A presents the
distribution of positions and types of ownership. The executives in our sample are assessed for
a diverse set of positions. Roughly half of the sample is assessed for CEO, CFO or COO
positions. About 31% of the candidates are assessed for CEO positions; 13% for CFO; and 6%
for COO. Almost 1,000 candidates were assessed for jobs that can be considered functional
level jobs. About 40% of these were financial jobs such as controller or vice president of
finance. Slightly more than 25% were in operations, while slightly fewer than 25% were in
marketing.
The sample candidates were assessed for companies that had a range of ownership forms.
We characterize ownership status as VC-funded, growth equity-funded, buyout-funded, public,
other private and investor. Almost half of the sample comes from buyout and growth equity
funded companies (classified as private equity funded companies below). An additional 15%
come from venture capital funded companies. Unlike KKS (2012), this sample also includes
executives from publicly owned companies who constitute 11% of the sample.

10

Panel B presents the relationship of hiring outcomes to whether the candidate is an
insider, i.e., currently works for the company. In many cases, the insider is also the incumbent
for the position. Roughly 59% of the assessed executives are hired for the position. Insiders are
substantially more likely to be hired (or retained) than outsiders.
Panel A of Table 3 reports the research assistants’ subjective assessments by position.
They rated 78% as nice persons, 58% as risk takers, 74% as having outgoing personalities, 65%
as being good at sales, and 35% as having broad past careers. These ratings provide background
and perspective for our interpretation of the factor scores, as discussed below. CEOs are
significantly more likely, and CFOs significantly less likely, to be perceived as risk takers, as
having outgoing personalities, and as being good at sales.
Panel B of Table 3 reports the subjective assessments of all candidates by the ownership
status of the assessing company. VC-funded firms are more likely to assess risk takers while
public companies are less likely to assess outgoing candidates and candidates with broad career
paths.
Panel C reports the subjective assessments of CEOs by the ownership status of the
assessing company. Perhaps surprisingly, private equity-owned firms seem less likely to
consider risk takers and more likely to consider nice persons for their CEO positions than are
public companies.
These subjective ratings and comparisons are intended to be suggestive. In the next
section, we show how they relate to the factors we estimate in the data.

11

II.

Characteristics and the Four Factors of Managerial Personalities
Table 4 presents the average scores for the thirty characteristics. The average scores for

each position are similar, with the exception of CFOs who score lower overall.
The scores are highly correlated across characteristics, as also documented in KKS
(2012), making it difficult to infer the effects of individual characteristics. E.g., it is not feasible
to include all thirty characteristics as explanatory variables in a multivariate regression due to
multi-collinearity. Therefore, like KKS (2012), we use a factor analysis to isolate the main
dimensions of variation in the characteristics.
For some executives, ratings for one of the thirty characteristics are missing. Rather than
discarding those executives from the sample, we augment the data by estimating the expected
value of the missing rating using an OLS regression with the other characteristics as explanatory
variables.

A.

Factor Scores
Panels A and B of Table 5 show the results of the factor analysis.6 Panel B shows the

eigenvalues and the fraction of the total variation in the characteristics that are explained by the
first six factors. An eigenvalue exceeding one suggests that the factor is valid. Based on these
eigenvalues, we focus on the first four factors from the factor analysis that combined explain
51.2% of the total variation in the candidates’ characteristics.

6

In the literature, the term factor analysis is used to describe a range of statistical procedures, including procedures
that are sometimes known as principal component analysis (PCA). Our estimates are produced using Stata’s “factor”
command with the “ml” and “altdivisor” options, and all presented factors are non-rotated. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin
measure of sampling adequacy is 0.94, suggesting that the data are very suited for factor analysis.
12

For the four factors, the factor loadings for the individual characteristics are shown in
Panel A.7 All four factors have natural interpretations. The first two factors are similar to those
found in KKS (2012), which used a much smaller sample (of 316 CEOs), and therefore did not
have sufficient statistical power to recover factors three and four.
Panel B of Table 5 shows that the first factor captures 32.2% of the total variation. Panel
A shows that this first factor has positive loadings on all the individual characteristics, ranging
from a loading of 0.29 on Integrity to a loading of 0.74 on Proactive. We therefore interpret this
factor as a measure of the candidates’ general ability.8 The structure of this first factor is
commonly encountered in factor analysis, and it reflects the general empirical tendency of
characteristics to all move together.
The second factor explains 9.9% of the variation in the characteristics and has two
distinct sets of loadings. The more positive loadings, in decreasing order, are for the
characteristics: Respect, Open to Criticism, Listening Skills and Teamwork. These
characteristics appear to capture a candidate’s interpersonal skills, and they also arguably reflect
the Big Five personality trait of agreeableness. In contrast, the more negative loadings are on the
characteristics: Aggressive, Fast, Proactive, Holds People Accountable and Removes
Underperformers. These characteristics arguably reflect a candidate’s execution ability.
The second factor, therefore, appears to sort candidates into those with better
interpersonal skills (and agreeableness) versus those with greater execution ability. It assigns
positive scores to candidates with greater interpersonal skills and negative scores to candidates
7

Note that the sign and magnitude of factor loadings are unidentified and cannot be interpreted. Mathematically, a
factor is a vector that is only identified up to scale and sign. It classifies characteristics that tend to vary together and
defines a scale that measures this covariation, but the scale itself is arbitrary. If one were to, say, reverse the signs
and double the magnitudes of all the individual loadings of a factor, this would change the scale but the statistical
inference about the effects of all factors would remain unchanged.
8
The pattern is also consistent with individual interviewers generally rating candidates higher or lower. The results
are largely unchanged when we include interviewer fixed effects.
13

with greater execution ability. The importance of this factor is consistent with the models in
Rotemberg and Saloner (1993) and Bolton, Brunnermeier, and Veldkamp (2013) that contrast
resoluteness and overconfidence with empathy and interpersonal skills in their models of CEO
types.
The third factor explains 5.2% of the total variation in the characteristics. Panel A shows
that its more negative loadings are for: Enthusiasm, Persuasion, Aggressive, Proactive, and Fast.
These characteristics seem to describe more charismatic candidates. In contrast, the more
positive loadings are on: Analytical Skills, Attention to Detail, Organization and Brainpower,
characteristics that describe candidates with stronger analytical skills.
We thus interpret the third factor as sorting candidates into those with more charismatic
personalities, who have a negative score on this factor, and candidates who have more analytical
skills, who have a positive score on this factor. This factor appears to be negatively related to the
Big Five personality trait of extraversion and positively related to the Big Five personality trait
of conscientiousness.9
Finally, the fourth factor explains 3.9% of the variation in the characteristics. The more
positive loadings are on: Strategic Vision, Brainpower, Analytical Skills, and Creative; the more
negative loadings are on: Holds People Accountable, Efficiency, Attention to Detail, and
Organization. This factor appears to sort candidates into those who focus on the bigger picture
and have a more strategic focus versus those who have more managerial approach with a
narrower focus on details. The fourth factor thus sorts candidates into those with a big-picture
and strategic focus versus those with a narrower attention to managerial details.

9

See also Gow et al. (2016) who use a cluster analysis on CEOs and relate them to the Big Five factors.
14

Overall, the results are consistent with the factor analysis in KKS (2012) performed on a
smaller sample of 316 candidates for CEO positions. The first two factors are qualitatively
similar. The candidates vary in their general level of ability as well as in their tilt towards either
interpersonal or execution-related characteristics. The larger sample used here further allows us
to identify the third and fourth factors. Candidates vary in their level of charisma (versus
analytical) and their focus on strategic issues (versus managerial details).

B.

Factors Scores and Subjective Ratings
Panel C of Table 5 shows pairwise correlations between the four factors, the five

subjective ratings, and gender. Candidates whom the research assistants subjectively rated as
nice persons score significantly higher on general ability (Factor 1), interpersonal (positive
Factor 2), and charisma (negative Factor 3). The relationship is particularly strong for Factor 2,
which is consistent with our interpretation of the factor as measuring interpersonal skills. The
concomitant implication, that candidates with stronger execution skills are less likely to be
perceived as nice persons, is also consistent with Pfeffer (2015).
Executives perceived as greater risk-takers score significantly higher on general ability
(Factor 1), execution (negative Factor 2), charisma (negative Factor 3) and strategic focus
(positive Factor 4).
Executives perceived as outgoing score significantly higher on general ability (Factor 1),
charisma (negative Factor 3) and strategic focus (positive Factor 4). The correlation with
(negative) Factor 3 is particularly strong, which is consistent with our interpretation of the factor
as measuring charisma.

15

Executives perceived to be good at sales score higher on general ability (Factor 1),
execution (negative Factor 2) and charisma (negative Factor 3). The strongest correlations are
with the general ability and charisma factors.
Finally, we note that the correlations between factor scores and gender are small, both
economically and statistically. None of the correlations between gender and the factor scores are
statistically significant.
Overall, the correlations in Panel C of Table 5 indicate that the subjective evaluations of
the assessments by our research assistants are strongly consistent with our interpretation of the
factors generated by the factor analysis.

III.

Executive characteristics and executive positions

A.

Factor Scores for candidates for different positions
Panel A of Table 6 reports the average factor scores across positions, and Figure 1

presents these data graphically. It is apparent that CEOs and CFOs receive diametrically
opposed scores. For each of the four factors, the average scores of CEO and CFO candidates
have opposite signs. CEO candidates score highest on general ability (Factor 1), execution
(negative Factor 2), charisma (negative Factor 3) and strategic focus (positive Factor 4). CFO
candidates, on the other hand, have lower scores on general ability, and score higher on
interpersonal (positive Factor 2), analytical (positive Factor 3), and focus on managerial details
(negative Factor 4). These patterns show in Figure 1, where CEOs are in the upper left quadrant
while CFOs are in the lower right quadrant.
Panel A also lists factor scores for candidates for COO, CXO (either CEO, CFO or COO)
and ALL candidates in the sample. COO candidates tend to have factor scores between CEO

16

and CFO candidates (except for Factor 4, suggesting that COOs have a stronger focus on
managerial details). These results suggest that CEOs are substantially different from other
executives in intuitive ways.
The results are consistent with those in Graham, Harvey and Puri (2013) who also find
that CEOs are different from CFOs. In their survey-based data, they find that CEOs are more
optimistic and more risk-tolerant than CFOs.
Although not reported in the table, the sample also contains thirty-three founders. They
score extremely high on charisma (negative Factor 3). We believe that this, too, is consistent
with our interpretation and the validity of these measures.
When interpreting the scores above, it is important to acknowledge that they are relative
scores within the sample. While the CFOs may score lower on some of these factors than CEOs,
that does not mean they are low relative to the average person. The results in Adams et al.
(2016) suggest that top executives as a group have above average ability. Moreover, when CEOs
are found to score higher than CFOs on general ability, execution, charisma, and strategic focus,
these scores should also be interpreted relative to the sample averages. Figure 1 shows that the
factor scores are constructed such that the average factor scores in the sample are mechanically
zero. It is thus important that a substantial part of the sample consists of Other candidates (i.e.,
non-CXO candidates). These Other candidates provide a control group that allows us to interpret
the factors scores of the CEO, CFO, and COO candidates relative to this control group. In
contrast, if the sample consisted of just CEO and CFO candidates, then mechanically for every
factor where CEOs were above zero, on average, CFOs would be below zero and vice versa.
Panel B of Table 6 reports the average factor scores by company ownership – venture
capital, private equity and public. The relative factor scores of CEOs relative to other managers

17

are qualitatively similar across the different types of ownership. CEO candidates have greater
general ability, stronger execution skills, and a more strategic focus. For all three groups, CEOs
have more charisma than CFOs; only for public companies, do CEOs not have the most charisma
of any group. Across all three groups, CFOs are substantially more analytical than the other
candidates. Across all types of positions, public company candidates have substantially greater
general ability and are more analytical (Factor 3) than candidates for venture capital and private
equity. Finally, CEOs for venture capital-backed companies are substantially more charismatic
(as opposed to analytical) and have greater strategic focus (as opposed to focusing on managerial
detail) than other CEO candidates.

B.

Factor scores for candidates who are hired
The average factor scores for candidates who are hired are shown in Panel C of Table 6

and illustrated by the arrows in Figure 1. Table 6 and Figure 1 show that hired candidates score
higher on general ability (Factor 1) than the average assessed candidate. In addition, hired
executives have better interpersonal skills and worse execution skills (Factor 2).
Panel A of Table 7 presents probit estimates of these differences. The reported
coefficients are marginal effects. A coefficient of one means no effect. A coefficient above one
gives the increase in the marginal probability of being hired arising from a one standard
deviation-increase in this factor. The first set of regressions includes controls for industry and
year-fixed effects. The second set of regressions also includes controls for the number of years
the executive has worked in the assessing company’s industry, an indicator for whether the
executive is an insider, and an indicator for the candidate’s gender (female is coded as one).

18

Panel A of Table 7 shows that, except for COOs, hired candidates score significantly
higher on general ability. The coefficient for COOs is also positive but not significant (COOs
have fewer observations and weaker statistical power). For example, the coefficients in
Specification 6 show that for candidates for CEO positions, a one standard deviation increase in
general ability is associated with a 24.8% increase in the likelihood that the candidate is hired.
In most specifications, hired candidates also have significantly better interpersonal skills
(versus execution skills). Specification 6 indicates that a one standard deviation increase in
interpersonal is associated with a 17.9% increase in the probability of being hired, suggesting
that interpersonal skills are valued differently in the ultimate hiring decision than when
identifying the pool of considered candidates. This is particularly interesting for CEOs, because
CEO candidates are distinguished by their execution skills, and because KKS (2012) find that
execution skills are more strongly correlated with CEOs’ success.
Candidates who are hired score significantly higher on charisma (negative Factor 3) than
the average candidate. When we include controls for the number of years in the industry,
insider, and gender, however, only the coefficient on COOs remains significant. This may be a
consequence of insiders tending to be perceived as more charismatic and less analytical than
outsiders.
Generally, the coefficients on the fourth factor are insignificant and with varying signs,
suggesting that a strategic focus versus a focus on managerial details does not affect the hiring
decision. Alternatively, Factor 4 captures the smallest amount of variation in the candidates’
characteristics and the sample may not have sufficient statistical power to capture the effect of
this factor.

19

The results indicate that greater ability and, particularly, greater interpersonal skills help
candidates land the jobs for which they are being considered. Consistent with this, in the
forthcoming book by two senior ghSMART executives, Botelho and Powell (2018) rely on this
result and their experiences with assessments to recommend that executives work hard to present
themselves as likeable when interviewing for a job.
The estimates of the effects of two of the control variables are also interesting. First,
insider candidates are significantly more likely to be hired across all positions. Second, gender is
insignificant for all positions. However, while insignificant, the estimated coefficients on gender
imply that female CEO candidates are 28% less likely to be hired while female CFO candidates
are 42% more likely to be hired. The insignificant coefficients are likely a result of the low
number of female candidates in the sample and the resulting weak statistical power.
Panel B of Table 7 shows estimates of the probit model after dividing the sample into
insiders and outsiders. The results are largely similar to those for the combined sample. One
difference between insiders and outsider is that talent appears to be more important for outside
candidates.
Panel C of Table 7 further includes controls for the candidate’s number of years in the
industry and the subjective ratings: nice person, risk taker, personality, good at sales and career
path. The estimated coefficients remain qualitatively similar to those in Panel B. Like
interpersonal skills (positive Factor 2), the rating on nice person is associated with an increased
likelihood of being hired, although it is not always significant. CEO candidates, particularly
outside candidates, also are more likely to be hired when they are rated as greater risk-takers.
Panel D of Table 7 repeats the analysis from Panel A for companies of different size.
Small companies are defined as companies with revenues less than $100 million; large

20

companies have revenues exceeding $1 billion; medium companies have revenues in between the
small and large cutoffs. (Note that the number of observations for the size subsamples do not add
up to the total number of observations because we could not obtain revenue estimates for all
companies.) Overall, the results are qualitatively similar for companies of all sizes.
Finally, Panel E of Table 7 repeats the analysis for companies with different ownership
structures – venture capital backed, private equity backed, and public. For all three structures,
executives with greater general ability are significantly more likely to be hired. Executives with
greater interpersonal skills are significantly more likely to be hired by PE firms and more likely
to be hired by public companies (although this difference is not statistically significant). The
results are qualitatively similar for CEOs of private equity backed companies. We do not have
enough observations to estimate the regressions separately for public company CEOs.

IV.

Executive Characteristics And Subsequent Careers
The previous results indicate that candidates for different positions have different

characteristics and skills. In this section, we consider whether those particular characteristics
and skills are predictive of the candidates’ future career progression.
While this analysis is inherently interesting, it also provides an implicit “out-of-sample”
test of the previous results. The assessments and hiring decisions of the candidates in our sample
may not be representative of these decisions more generally. For example, ghSMART’s
interviewers might rate CEO candidates higher on certain characteristics, because they expect
CEO candidates to have these characteristics or because this bias is inherent in ghSMART’s
assessment methodology. Alternatively, the characteristics and factor scores may be specific to
ghSMART’s assessment methodology and lose their validity outside of this assessment setting.

21

One way to assess the general validity of the assessments and factor structure is to see
whether they predict the candidates’ subsequent career progression. We are particularly
interested in whether the characteristics of non-CEO candidates, i.e. candidates that were
considered for a position other than a CEO position when assessed by ghSMART, can predict
whether these candidates subsequently become CEOs.
Note that these subsequent promotions or job changes occur without the involvement of
ghSMART. They may involve other recruiting or assessment firms, or they may occur internally
in firms, following the firms’ HR practices. Either way, the finding that the assessments in our
data remain able to predict these career progressions would suggest that our results are not
specific to the particular setting involving ghSMART, and it would confirm that different
positions require candidates with different characteristics and skills.
For each of the candidates in our sample, we used LinkedIn, CapitalIQ and other internet
searches to determine their subsequent career path and whether the candidate subsequently
becomes a CEO, COO or CFO. For each position, for a given title, Table 8 reports the fraction
of candidates who eventually end up with this title. For example, Panel A reports whether
candidates eventually become CEOs based on whether the candidates interviewed for a CEO
position in our sample. Over 78% of the candidates who interviewed for CEO jobs, ultimately
became CEOs. More importantly, slightly over 10% of the candidates who did not interview for
CEO positions in our sample eventually became CEOs. The other panels report similar results
for CFOs, COOs, and CFOs. Panel D shows that just 4.5% of CFO candidates ultimately become
CEOs.

22

A.

Average Factor Scores
Panel A of Table 9 reports the average factor scores of candidates who eventually obtain

a management position, but did not interview for such a position. Candidates who were not
considered for a CEO position, but nevertheless ultimately become CEOs, have higher scores on
general ability, execution, charisma, and strategic focus. This pattern mirrors our earlier results
on different executive characteristics across different positions, and it supports our finding that
this pattern is specific to CEOs. More formally, in the next section, we use probit analyses to
estimate statistical significance and to control for other variables that might be driving these
results.

B.

Probit Analysis
In the probit regressions in Panels B and C of Table 9, the dependent variable is an

indicator for whether the candidate eventually achieves the indicated executive position (CEO,
COO or CFO), and the explanatory variables include the candidate’s observed characteristics at
the time of the interview, including the factor scores. For each specification, the sample is
restricted to candidates who are assessed for positions other than the indicated executive position
eventually reached.
Panel B of Table 9 shows results for the entire sample, with the first three specifications
containing industry and year fixed effects. Specification 1 in Panel B shows that the likelihood of
becoming a CEO is significantly related to the four factors in exactly the same direction as they
are related to CEO characteristics. The likelihood of an executive subsequently becoming a
CEO increases with general ability (Factor 1), execution (negative Factor 2), charisma (negative
Factor 3) and strategic focus (positive Factor 4). A one standard deviation change in these four

23

factors is associated, respectively, with a 19.8%, 16.5%, 13.5% and 16.7% increase in the
likelihood of becoming a CEO.
Specification 2 suggests that candidates who are more analytical (and less charismatic)
are significantly more likely to become CFOs. Specification 3 indicates that candidates with
more general ability and more focus on managerial details are more likely to become COOs.
Panel C repeats Specifications 1 to 3 for venture capital, private equity and publicly
owned companies. While the results are not always statistically significant, likely due to a
decline in the statistical power from the smaller sample sizes, the qualitative patterns remain
similar for all three groups for CEOs. Executives rated higher in general ability, execution,
charisma, and strategic focus are more likely to become CEOs for all three types of companies.
Across all three groups, the coefficients on execution and strategic focus are particularly large.
Specifications 4 to 6 of Panel B of Table 9 include the three additional control variables:
years in industry, insider and female. The results are qualitatively similar to those in the first
three regressions.
Specifications 7 to 9 of Panel B of Table 9 further include the five subjective ratings, and
the results are qualitatively similar to those in the previous specifications. For CEOs, the results
for the factors are similar, but only Factor 4 (strategic focus) remains statistically significant.
The reduced significance of Factor 2 is likely driven by its correlation with the rating for nice
person. Like executives with high scores on Factor 2 (low execution but high interpersonal),
executives with a higher rating on nice person are also less likely to become CEOs. Again, these
results support Pfeffer (2015) who says that CEOs cannot be particularly nice people. Similarly,
the reduced significance of Factor 3 (charisma) is likely driven by its correlation with being a
risk taker and good at sales, both of which are also significantly related to becoming a CEO.

24

These results also are strongly consistent with those in Green et al. (2015) that more extraverted
CFOs are more likely to become CEOs.
Overall, these “out-of-sample” results support the validity of the assessments and our
earlier results about managerial characteristics. CEOs tend to be more talented, more executionoriented, more charismatic and with a greater strategic focus. Non-CEOs with those
characteristics are more likely to become CEOs than other non-CEOs. The different results for
CFOs (versus CEOs) provide additional support for the validity of the assessments. The results
strongly support the hypothesis that different characteristics and factors are important for
different managerial positions. The results are also predictive for which candidates are more
likely to ultimately become CEOs.
Finally, the results on gender in Specifications 4 to 9 of Panel B in Table 9 are notable.
Holding talent and skills constant, female candidates are significantly less likely to become
CEOs and COOs. (They also appear to be less likely to become CFOs, but the coefficient is not
statistically significant).

V.

Summary and Discussion
Using a data set containing more than 2,600 assessments of candidates for top managerial

positions – including CEOs, CFOs, and COOs – we can classify the candidate’s characteristics
by four factors: general ability, execution versus interpersonal, charisma versus analytical, and
having a strategic focus versus a focus on managerial details. The first two factors are similar to
the factors identified in a smaller sample of just CEO candidates in KKS (2012).
CEO candidates typically have higher scores on general ability, execution, charisma, and
a strategic focus. CFOs, on the other hand, have lower scores on general ability, and tend to be

25

more interpersonal, analytical, and with a focus on managerial details. According to our
classification, these two types are diametrically opposite. These results are consistent with those
in Graham et al. (2013) who also find that CEOs differ from CFOs in being more optimistic and
less risk averse. In our data, risk taking is positively correlated with execution and charisma.
We also find that candidates considered by public and larger companies score higher than
candidates from private and smaller companies. This is consistent with the results in Adams et
al. (2016) who find that CEOs are more (cognitively and non-cognitively) talented on average,
and that larger companies hire more talented CEOs.
Scores on the four factors predict the candidates’ future career progression. Non-CEO
candidates who have more CEO-like personalities are more likely to subsequently become
CEOs. This “out-of-sample” test provides strong evidence that our assessments provide valid
measures of the candidates’ personalities. It also provides strong evidence that these
personalities and skills can be assessed, that they are persistent, and that the distribution of
personality across positions and hiring decisions documented here remain valid in other hiring
situations, including promotion and hiring situations that involve firms other than those in our
sample and do not rely on ghSMART.
We do not find any substantial differences in the four factors for men and women. We do
find, however, that women are less likely to become CEOs and COOs, controlling for these
factors.
Finally, hired candidates generally have greater interpersonal skills than the assessed
candidates. This suggests that interpersonal skills are valued differently when used in the hiring
decision than when used to identifying a pool of candidates. This is particularly interesting for
CEOs, given that CEO candidates are especially distinguished by their execution skills, that

26

executions skills predict whether candidates subsequently become CEOs, and that the result in
KKS (2012) show that execution skills are strongly correlated with success.
We believe these results both complement existing academic research and are potentially
relevant for boards choosing CEOs as well as for candidates aspiring to become CEOs.
First, our results are relevant to previous academic work. The finding that CEOs are
different from and more talented than other executives is consistent with the results in Adams et
al. (2016) and Graham et al. (2013). The strong CEO loadings on the execution factor (versus
interpersonal) and charisma are arguably consistent with Pfeffer (2016). The finding that CEOs
are strong in charisma is consistent with the findings in Green et al. (2015) and Palaiou and
Funrham (2015) that CEOs are more extraverted.
Second, the results in this paper and KKS (2012), taken together, suggest that boards
should focus more on execution skills when choosing a CEO. While we do not consider
subsequent performance in this paper, KKS (2012) study the performance of a subset of our
sample and find that the execution factor is highly correlated with subsequent CEO success for
private-equity funded companies. The results in this paper complement those in KKS (2012) by
finding that the execution factor is important for distinguishing CEO candidates and for
determining whether an executive ultimately becomes a CEO. The fact that the results in this
paper are qualitatively similar for public company and private company CEOs suggests that the
results in KKS (2012) are not specific to private equity.
Third, the result that hired CEO candidates score lower on execution skills (and higher on
interpersonal skills) than interviewed candidates on average makes it natural to think that boards
and shareholders overweight interpersonal skills in their hiring decisions. This seems possible,
given that interpersonal skills are correlated with our research assistants’ classification of

27

candidates as nice persons. This also is consistent with Barrick et al. (2012) who find that
interviewers’ first impressions and rapport with a candidate affects their evaluation of the
candidate. This seems to be a productive avenue for future research.
Finally, the results potentially provide some guidance to those who aspire to be CEOs.
Executives who score higher on execution, charisma and have a strategic focus are more likely to
become CEOs. An important question is whether it is possible for a candidate to improve those
factors or skills. It seems plausible that executives can improve execution skills by being more
persistent, efficient and proactive. In fact, Drucker (1967) recommends precisely these actions to
become an effective executive. It is less clear whether executives can improve their charisma
and their strategic focus. This, too, is an interesting question for future research.

Table 5: Factor Loadings Panel A gives the factor loadings on the four first factors for all
interviewed candidates. Loadings less than 0.15 in absolute value are blank. Panel B gives the
eigenvalues and the proportion of variation that is explained by the four factors. Panel C shows
pairwise correlations across candidates between the loadings on the four factors, gender, as well
as the subjective ratings of nice person, risk taker, personality, good at sales and career path
(coded as described in Table 3). In Panel C, the four factors are orthogonal by construction, so
their individual correlations are omitted. Statistical significance at the 5% level is indicated with
a star.

Table 7: Probit Estimates of Hired for Position This table shows marginal effects from a probit model where the dependent
variable is an indicator for whether a given candidate is hired. Standard errors are in parentheses. Due to the low number of
observations relative to the number of explanatory variables, Panels B and C omit incumbent CFO and COOs due to a low number of
observations. Panel D defines company size according to revenue, with Small companies having less than $100m, Medium ones
having between $100m and $1b, and Large companies having more than $1m in annual revenue.

Table 9: Who eventually become executives? Panel A shows average factor scores of candidates that are not assessed for the
indicated position but eventually obtain it. Panels B and C show estimated marginal effects using a probit model where the depending
variable is an indicator for whether the candidate eventually achieves an executive position as indicated (CEO, COO, or CFO),
depending on the candidate’s observed characteristics at the time of the interview. The sample is restricted to candidates with titles, at
the time of the interview, that are not the indicated executive position eventually reached. Standard errors are in parentheses.
