Order Backlogs and Production

Smoothing

ABSTRACT

Empirical examination of some
aggregate manufacturing data suggests that order
backlogs may help explain two puzzling facts: (l)the variability of
production
appears to be greater than that of demand, arid
(2)inventorjes
appear
to be
drawn down when demand is low, built up when demand is high.

11. The Model and Tests

The empirical work requires data on backlogs. The Department of Commerce
only collects such data for what are called "production to order" industries.
The model used will therefore be one that is appropriate for such industries.
These are industries in which orders ordinarily arrive before production is

completed. Storage costs for the finished product tend to be

relatively large

and the product line fairly heterogeneous (Abramovitz (1950), Zarnowitz (1973)).
According to Belsley (1969), most two digit industries produce primarily to
order, including virtually all durable goods industries.

Backlogs tend to be

substantial, relative either to shipments or to physical inventories.

This is

illustrated for aggregate durables in Figure 1, which plots backlogs, shipments,
and two measures of inventories, finished goods and the sum of finished goods and

works in progress. The backlog to shipment ratio, or the (backlog -

physical

inventories) to shipment ratio, suggests that customers typically wait anywhere
from one to five months for shipment.

(1969) for further discussion.

It should be noted that all the tests in this paper are robust to the possibility

I will consider two empirical

implications of the model. The first concerns

response to demand fluctuations. See West
(1986) and the appendix for a precise argument.1
If the variables are not

stationary, var(N) and var(Q) do not exist. Related

literature suggests that empirical tests that nonetheless assume that
they exist

may be seriously misleading (Fuller (1976), Marsh and Merton (1986)). By
continuity, this also may be true in a given finite sample, if the variables are

nearly nonstationary. The data used here in fact appear to be nonstationary or
nearly so, even after growth is removed.

XII. Empirical Results
A. Data

The data were monthly and

seasonally adjusted, 1967-1984. (Data that are

not seasonally adjusted might be preferable (Miron and Zeldes (1986)) but
are not

available for backlogs.) Nominal

backlog data were conveniently available from

CITIBASE for aggregate durables and six two digit manufacturing industries:
stone, clay and glass (SIC 32), primary
34), non-electrical machinery (SIC

metals (SIC 33), fabricated metals (SIC

35), electrical machinery (SIC 36),

transportation equipment (SIC 37), and instruments (SIC 38). BEA constant (1972)

dollar inventory data on finished goods and works in progress inventories and
shipments were kindly supplied by Jeff Miron. Inventory data were converted
from
cost to market as in West (l983a) and

Blinder and Holtz-Eakin (1983).

al. (1980, ppl56-57), as well as a reading of Bureau of the Censuses Form
(Appendix I in Foss et al. (1980)) suggests

that it is reasonable to assume that

firms value the entire backlog at current delivery prices. Real backlogs were
therefore obtained by deflating the

As a check on the deflation procedure, real backlogs

were also obtained for aggregate durables by deflating by the producer price

index. The resulting second moments

of the data were very similar to those

reported in Table 1 below.

Before any estimation, a common geometric

trend was removed from all

variables. (This is consistent with the model, as shown in the appendix.) The
estimated common growth rates for finished goods inventories, backlogs and
shipments, in percent per month,

were: .18, -.01, -.00, -.03

(l986a), however, the production variance is almost always

greater than the shipment variance (columns (5) and (7)).
Since column (4) is less than one and column (6) is positive, it follows

that cov(Nt,AHt)<O. Net inventories therefore on average are accumulated during
expansions, decumulated during contractions.

The tendency for H to be built up when N is

low, to be drawn down when N is high, is quite apparent.

The plots of B and

works in progress + finished goods inventories indicate that the theoretically
predicted pattern of fluctuations for H essentially reflects procyclical
accumulation of backlogs but not countercyclical accumulation of physical

inventories. It is worth noting that while the model does not formally determine
a level of inventories separate from that of backlogs, the actual inventory
behavior probably is consistent with production smoothing behavior in production

to order industries. Abramowitz (1950) and Belsley (1969) suggest that finished
goods inventories, at least, are built up in part because of unavoidable delays

in transit. One might therefore expect inventories to be built up when shipments
are high.

Additional evidence on the role of net inventories in buffering production
may be found in the impulse response functions in Table 3. The functions are

calculated from estimates of equations (6) and (7). (These estimates are
available on request. Regression estimates and impulse response functions were
also calculated for net inventories =

reported because they were quite similar to those in Table 3.) Since the period
is a month, the entry for period 12 indicates the response one year after the
shock, for 24 two years after, and so on.

The estimates indicate that from 40 to 80 percent of the initial impact of a
demand shock is absorbed by net inventories, with production adjusting gradually.

IV.CQnc..lus lpflc

A production smoothing model is qualitatively consistent with some
aggregate
data when it is assumed that net
inventories (physical inventories minus
backlogs), rather than physical inventories,

production is less than that of

buffer production. The variance of

new orders, so production is smoother than

demand. The covariance of new orders and

investment

in net inventories is

negative, so that net inventories are accumulated
during contractions,

decumulated during expansions. A positive shock to new orders is buffered
by net
inventories, so that production rises
only gradually to meet increases in demand.
These results are in no sense definitive.

The model that I used assumed

rather implausibly that backlogs are negative inventories. No standard
errors

were calculated in any of the tests. The data

were purely for production to

order industries.

One therefore cannot jump to the
major determinant of both backlogs and

conclusion that production smoothing is the

inventories.

Nonetheless, in conjunction

12

with the conclusions of other papers, the present results seem highly suggestive.

Theoretical work using more carefully

formulated models than mine indicates that

the presence of backlogs may indeed explain apparently anomalous production

behavior (Kahn (1986), Maccini (1973)). Empirical

work at least since Lovell's

(1961) seminal research has found an important role for backlogs; recent

contributions include Blinder (l986b) and Maccini and Rossana (1984). Large and
volatile backlogs are perhaps more pervasive than many researchers, including
myself (West (1986)) have assumed: of the six two digit manufacturing industries

classified by Belsley (1969) as production to stock, two (apparel [SIC 23] and
chemicals [SIC 281) in fact are or have become largely production to order (Foss
et al. (1980, pplS8)).

The fundamental question is whether firms

The first implication follows from the law of iterated expectations, since,
under the assumption that at most one difference is required to induce
stationarity, each term in each infinite sum has a finite unconditional
expectation.

In versions of the model in which 80=0 (e.g., Blinder (l986a)), equations

(4) and (5) follow from (A3). If a00 (e.g., Belsley (1969)), (4) and (5)
follow if 0<var(AN)-var(AQ). Although not reported in the paper, the sample
variances of N and AQ obeyed this inequality for all eight data sets.
(B)As stated in the text, the data actually used in the regressions were

scaled by a growth rate of (l+g)t. It is assumed that b(l+g)<l. In
explaining how this fits into the model, it is convenient to call h,

the original data in levels and H,

and

and Nt the scaled data (e.g.,

Hh/(l+g)t). The full cost function, including deterministic terms, is

(A4)

2

+ a0(Aq_m0) + a1(q_m1) + a2(_h_a3q_m2)

A4kt is a purely deterministic term that grows no faster than (l+g)t.

The m.

shift the minimum cost points for each of the three types of costs. Each

has both deterministic and stochastic components, m. =

are the white noise cost shocks in equation (2). The

grow

deterministically, c.=(l+g)tc,.
Using the (A4) definition of costs, differentiate (Al) with respect to
ht, divide by 2 and rearrange to get

It follows from algebra in part (C) below that if Nt is stationary in levels

or some difference, then so is Ht. Thus, if Nt grows at rate l+g, so does Ht.
(C)Call A1 and A2 the two smallest (in modulus) roots to the fourth degree

(A5) lag polynomial in Ht. The comparable polynomial in (A6) has roots

and l/[b(l+g)A2]. So if A1)<l and
X1/(l+g), X2/(1+g), 1/fb(l+g)X1]

the (A6) lag polynomial has exactly two stable and two unstable roots. Let

Solving the stable roots backwards, the

It follows from the argument in Blanchard (1983) that if the firm uses only
past new orders to forecast future new orders, and that equation (6)
represents the univariate new orders process, then equation (7) is the closed
form solution to (A7).
