Does the Investment Model Explain Value and Momentum Simultaneously?

ABSTRACT
Two innovations in the structural investment model go a long way in explaining value and
momentum jointly. Firm-level investment returns are constructed from firm-level accounting
variables, and are then aggregated to the portfolio level to match with portfolio-level stock
returns. In addition, current assets form a separate production input besides physical capital. The
model fits well the value, momentum, investment, and profitability premiums jointly, and
partially explains the positive stock-investment return correlations, the procyclicality and shortterm dynamics of the momentum and profitability premiums, and the countercyclicality and longterm dynamics of the value and investment premiums. However, the model fails to explain
momentum crashes.

Introduction

The investment model of asset pricing provides an economics-based framework for the cross section of expected returns. However, prior studies suggest that the model fails to explain value and
momentum simultaneously. Liu, Whited, and Zhang (2009) estimate a baseline model, but find
that the marginal product and adjustment costs parameters vary greatly across the value and momentum deciles. If the model is well specified, or “structural,” the parameter estimates should be
mostly invariant across different testing portfolios. Liu and Zhang (2014) document further that
when fitting value and momentum portfolios jointly, the baseline model accounts for the momentum premium, but implies a large and negative value premium. In a prominent, new asset pricing
textbook, Campbell (2017) writes: “This problem, that different parameters are needed to fit each
anomaly, is a pervasive one in the q-theoretic asset pricing literature (p. 275).” This empirical
challenge is important, since it has hindered further applications of the economic model.
This paper shows that two innovations go a long way in resolving the empirical difficulty. First,
prior studies estimate the model at the portfolio level. Firm-level accounting variables are aggregated to portfolio-level variables, from which portfolio-level investment returns are constructed to
match with portfolio-level stock returns. While a useful first stab, this procedure has a couple of
drawbacks. On economic grounds, it assumes that firms within a given portfolio all follow the identical investment decision rule. This assumption is clearly counterfactual. On econometric grounds,
the procedure misses a substantial amount of heterogeneity in firm-level variables that can help
identify structural parameters. We instead use firm-level variables to construct firm-level investment
returns, which are aggregated to the portfolio level to match with portfolio-level stock returns.
Second, the baseline model in the prior studies only has physical capital (net property, plant,
and equipment) as the single production input. However, physical capital is only a small fraction
of total assets on firms’ balance sheet. While many choices exist to introduce an additional production input, we settle on current assets. In addition, we impose zero adjustment costs on current

1

assets, an assumption that we verify empirically. Consequently, the resulting two-capital model is
as parsimonious as the baseline, physical capital model with only two parameters.
The two-capital model estimated at the firm level goes a long way in explaining value and momentum simultaneously. The parameter estimates are relatively stable across the testing deciles.
When fitting value and momentum deciles jointly, with and without adding the asset growth and
return on equity deciles, the scatter plots of average predicted stock returns versus average realized
stock returns are mostly aligned with the 45-degree line. In particular, when fitting the valueweighted deciles formed on value, momentum, investment, and return on equity simultaneously,
the model predicts a value premium of 4.96% per annum, with a pricing error of 1.6% (t = 0.46),
a momentum premium of 16.22%, with an error of −0.75% (t = −0.25), an investment premium of
−4.63%, with an error of −0.48% (t = −0.23), as well as a return on equity premium of 9.22%, with
an error of −0.95% (t = −0.39). However, the model is still rejected by the test of overidentification.
Aggregation is important for the two-capital model’s performance. When implemented at the
portfolio level, the parameter estimates are less stable, and the model yields larger pricing errors,
especially for the value premium. In particular, with the 40 value-weighted deciles together, the
alternative aggregation yields a value premium of only 1.56% per annum, with an error of 5%
(t = 1.85). With the 40 equal-weighted deciles, the value premium is even negative in the model,
−1.13%, giving rise to a huge error of 10.08% (t = 3.32). In contrast, the benchmark specification
predicts an equal-weighted value premium of 4.85%, albeit still with an error of 4.1% (t = 1.86).
Introducing current assets is also important for the benchmark model’s performance. Although
the physical capital model implemented at the firm level yields largely stable parameter estimates,
it is severely misspecified. In the data, the fraction of physical capital in the sum of physical capital and current assets averages only 38%, and ranges from 7% at the 5th percentile, 32% at the
50th percentile, to 88% at the 95th percentile. Consequently, the average product in the physical
capital model, mismeasured as sales-to-physical capital, averages 9.59, with a median of 5.21 and

2

a large standard deviation of 14.46 in the data. In contrast, the average product in the two-capital
model, measured as sales scaled by the sum of physical capital and current assets, averages only
1.67, with a median of 1.51 and a modest standard deviation of 1.05. The measurement errors in
the average product translate to large errors for the one-capital model. In particular, with the 40
value-weighted deciles together, the value premium in the model is negative, −2.85% per annum,
with a large error of 9.14% (t = 3.36). The model also exaggerates the momentum premium to
20.57%, with an error of 5.09% (t = 1.43). The equal-weighted errors are even larger in magnitude.
We also use the “fundamental” returns (the predicted stock returns from the benchmark model)
to study the dynamics of factor premiums. Because the model’s parameters are estimated from the
average returns moments only, the dynamics serve as separate diagnostics on the model’s performance. The model predicts significantly positive stock-fundamental return correlations, overcoming
another difficulty in prior studies that report weakly negative correlations. The stock-fundamental
correlations of factor premiums are all positive, ranging from 0.18 to as high as 0.54. The model is
consistent with the short-lived nature of the momentum and return on equity premiums as well as
the long-lasting nature of the value and investment premiums. The model also partially explains
the procyclical variation of the momentum and return on equity premiums as well as the countercyclical variation of the value and investment premiums. However, the model underestimates the
volatility, skewness, and kurtosis of factor premiums, and fails to explain momentum crashes.
Cochrane (1991) is the first to use the investment model to study asset prices. Restoy and
Rockinger (1994) establish the analytical relation between stock and fundamental returns under
constant returns to scale. Cochrane (1996) specifies the stochastic discount factor as a linear function of aggregate investment returns in cross-sectional tests. Belo (2010) uses the marginal rate of
transformation as the stochastic discount factor in asset pricing tests. Jermann (2010) examines
the equity premium implied from the investment model. Cooper and Priestley (2016) use the investment model to study the cost of capital for private firms. Li (2017) constructs a quantitative,
theoretical model to explain value and momentum jointly. We differ by implementing the invest3

ment model via structural estimation on the real data. Aggregation and capital heterogeneity have
been largely ignored in the prior literature. We show that incorporating these realistic features in
the data goes a long way in improving the model’s performance in structural estimation.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets up the model of the firms. Section
3 presents our econometric methods. Section 4 describes our data. Section 5 discusses our GMM
estimation and tests, and Section 6 the separate diagnostics. Finally, Section 7 concludes.

The Model of the Firms

Firms use both short-term capital (current assets) and physical capital (long-term assets) to
produce a homogeneous output. Let Πit ≡ Π(Kit , Cit , Xit ) denote the operating profits of firm
i at time t, in which Kit is physical capital, Cit current assets, and Xit a vector of exogenous
aggregate and firm-specific shocks. We assume that Πit exhibits constant returns to scale, i.e.,
Πit = Kit ∂Πit /∂Kit + Cit ∂Πit /∂Cit . We also assume that firms have a Cobb-Douglas production
function. The marginal product of physical capital can then be parameterized as ∂Πit /∂Kit =
γ K Yit /Kit , in which γ K > 0 is a technological parameter, and Yit sales (Gilchrist and Himmelberg
1998). Similarly, the marginal product of current assets is ∂Πit /∂Cit = γ C Yit /Cit , in which γ C > 0.
Taking operating profits as given, firms choose investments in both short- and long-term capital
stocks to maximize the market value of equity. Physical capital evolves as Kit+1 = Iit + (1 − δit )Kit ,
in which Iit is investment in physical capital, and δ it the rate of depreciation that firm i takes as
given. We allow δ it to be firm-specific and time-varying. Current assets evolve as Cit+1 = Jit + Cit ,
in which Jit is investment in current assets. We assume that current assets do not depreciate. Firms
incur adjustment costs when investing in physical capital, but not in current assets.1 The adjustment costs function, denoted Φ(Iit , Kit ), is increasing and convex in Iit , decreasing in Kit , and of
constant returns to scale in Iit and Kit , i.e., Φ(Iit , Kit ) = Iit ∂Φ(Iit , Kit )/∂Iit +Kit ∂Φ(Iit , Kit )/∂Kit .
1

In the appendix, we document in detail that the adjustment costs estimates on current assets are insignificantly
different from zero for most testing deciles, especially in the joint estimation.

in which a > 0 is the adjustment costs parameter of physical capital.
At the beginning of time t, firm i issues debt, Bit+1 , which must be repaid at the beginning of
B , which varies
t+1. When borrowing, firms take as given the gross cost of debt on Bit , denoted rit

across firms and over time. Taxable corporate profits equal operating profits less physical capital

Let Mt+1 be the stochastic discount factor from t to t + 1. Taking Mt+1 as given, firm i chooses

P
Vit ≡ Et [ ∞

which prevents the firm from borrowing an infinite amount of debt. The firm’s first-order condition

for physical investment implies Et [Mt+1 rit+1

is the physical investment return:

Intuitively, the physical investment return is the marginal benefit of physical investment at t + 1
I
divided by its marginal cost at t. Et [Mt+1 rit+1
] = 1 says that the marginal cost equals the next pe-

riod marginal benefit discounted to t. In the numerator of equation (2), (1 − τ t+1 )γ K (Yit+1 /Kit+1 )
is the after-tax marginal product of physical capital, (1 − τ t+1 )(a/2)(Iit+1 /Kit+1 )2 is the after-tax
marginal reduction in physical adjustment costs, and τ t+1 δ it+1 is the marginal depreciation tax
shield. The last term in the numerator is the marginal continuation value of an extra unit of physical capital net of depreciation, in which the marginal continuation value equals the marginal cost

of physical investment in the next period, 1 + (1 − τ t+1 )a(Iit+1 /Kit+1 ).

Similarly, the firm’s first-order condition for investment in current assets is Et [Mt+1 rit+1

in which rit+1

The current investment return is again the marginal benefit of current (assets) investment at t + 1
divided by its marginal cost at t. The marginal cost equals one because of no adjustment costs
on current assets. For the marginal benefit, (1 − τ t+1 )γ C (Yit+1 /Cit+1 ) is the after-tax marginal
product of current assets, and without adjustment costs or depreciation, the marginal continuation
value of an extra unit of current assets net of depreciation equals one.

equals the marginal cost of physical investment, 1 + (1 − τ t )a(Iit /Kit ). The shadow price of current
K ≡q K
assets equals one. Finally, define wit
it it+1 /(qit Kit+1 + Cit+1 ) as the weight of the firm’s mar-

ket value attributed to physical capital. Then the weighted average of the two investment returns
equals the weighted average of the cost of equity and the after-tax cost of debt (Appendix A):

average cost of capital, as in Liu, Whited, and Zhang (2009). If wit
it

reduces to the equivalence between the stock and physical investment returns as in Cochrane (1991).
Equation (5) clearly shows that even without adjustment costs, current assets help describe the
cost of capital distribution across firms more accurately. In this regard, current assets are different
from labor, which does not appear on firms’ balance sheet as assets. Firms hire, but do not own,
workers. As a result, without adjustment costs on labor hiring, the labor input will be absorbed
into the operating profits function, and will not affect the cost of capital distribution.

Econometric Methods

This section describes our econometric methods, including our structural estimation and tests in
Section 3.1 and the new, exact aggregation procedure in Section 3.2.

3.1

Generalized Method of Moments (GMM)

We use GMM to test the ex ante restriction implied by equation (5):
S
F
E[rpt+1
− rpt+1
] = 0,

(6)

S
F
in which rpt+1
is the stock return of testing portfolio p, and rpt+1
is portfolio p’s fundamental return

given by the right hand side of equation (5). In particular, the pricing error from the investment
S
F
model is defined as ep ≡ ET [rpt+1
− rpt+1
], in which ET [·] is the sample mean.

Although the model has three parameters (γ K , γ C , and a), γ K and γ C enter the moment condition (6) only in the form of γ ≡ γ K + γ C . To see this point, we use equations (2) and (3) to rewrite:
K I
K J

rit+1 + (1 − wit
)rit+1 =
K
wit

(1 − τ t+1 )(γ K + γ C )Yit+1 /(Kit+1 + Cit+1 )

(1 − τ t+1 )(a/2) (Iit+1 /Kit+1 )2 + τ t+1 δ it+1 + (1 − δ it+1 )qit+1
K
+ (1 − wit
).
qit

(7)

As such, γ K and γ C are not separately identifiable, and only their sum, γ, can be estimated. With
only two parameters, γ and a, the two-capital model with physical capital and current assets is as
7

parsimonious as the baseline model with only physical capital.
Also, the numerator of the first term in the right hand side of equation (7) shows that the
marginal product in the two-capital model should be measured as proportional to the ratio of sales to
the sum of physical capital and current assets, Yit+1 /(Kit+1 +Cit+1 ), as opposed to sales-to-physical
capital, Yit+1 /Kit+1 , in the physical capital model. Finally, the denominator of the first term can be
interpreted as the weighted average of the marginal q of physical capital and that of current assets
(one), with the weight given by Kit+1 /(Kit+1 + Cit+1 ) and Cit+1 /(Kit+1 + Cit+1 ), respectively.
Formally, let c ≡ (γ, a) denote the model’s parameter, and gT the sample moments. The GMM
objective function is a weighted sum of squares of the errors across a set of testing portfolios,
gT′ WgT , in which we set W = I, the identity matrix (Cochrane 1996). Let D = ∂gT /∂c and S be
a consistent estimate of the variance-covariance matrix of the sample errors, gT . The S estimate
accounts for autocorrelations of up to 12 lags. The estimate of c, denoted ĉ, is asymptotically normal with the variance-covariance matrix given by var(ĉ) = (D′ WD)−1 D′ WSWD(D′ WD)−1 /T .
To construct the standard errors for the pricing errors of individual portfolios, we use the variance
 
′
covariance matrix for gT , var(gT ) = I − D(D′ WD)−1 D′ W S I − D(D′ WD)−1 D′ W /T . Finally, we form a χ2 test on the null hypothesis that all the pricing errors are jointly zero,

gT′ [var(gT )]+ gT ∼ χ2 (# moments − # parameters), in which χ2 is the chi-square distribution
with the degrees of freedom given by the number of moments minus the number of parameters,
and the superscript

denotes pseudo-inversion (Hansen 1982).

Aggregation

Prior studies estimate the physical capital model with accounting data aggregated to the portfolio level. Portfolio-level fundamental returns are constructed from portfolio-level characteristics to
match with portfolio-level stock returns. Formally, the prior studies estimate:

Working with this aggregation procedure, Liu, Whited, and Zhang (2009) show that the physical
capital model explains value and momentum separately, but the parameter estimates vary greatly
across the two sets of deciles. In addition, Liu and Zhang (2014) show that when forced to use the
same parameter values in the joint estimation, the physical capital model manages to capture the
momentum premium, but fails to explain the value premium altogether.
We explore a new, exact aggregation procedure. We first construct firm-level fundamental returns from firm-level accounting variables, and then aggregate to portfolio-level fundamental returns
to match with portfolio-level stock returns. Formally, we estimate:

Data

We obtain firm-level data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) monthly stock
file and the annual Standard and Poor’s Compustat industrial files. We exclude firms with primary
9

standard industrial classifications between 6000 and 6999 (financial firms) when forming testing
portfolios. When calculating the fundamental returns, we further exclude firms for which total
assets, net property, plant, and equipment, or sales are either zero or negative at each portfolio
formation. The sample for stock and fundamental returns is from January 1967 to December 2015.

4.1

Testing Portfolios

We use 40 testing deciles formed on book-to-market equity, momentum, asset growth, and return
on equity, either separately or jointly. Book-to-market and momentum are the anomalies that
underpin the popular Carhart (1997) four-factor model. We also include asset growth and return
on equity, both of which feature prominently in the new generation of factor pricing models (Hou,
Xue, and Zhang 2015, see also Fama and French 2015).
To control for microcaps (stocks smaller than the 20th percentile of market equity of NYSE
stocks), we form two sets of testing deciles. In the first set, we sort stocks with NYSE breakpoints,
and calculate value-weighted decile returns. In the second set, we first exclude microcaps from our
sample. We then sort the remaining stocks into deciles, and calculate equal-weighted decile returns.
To form the book-to-market (Bm) deciles, at the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks on
Bm, which is the book equity for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1 divided by the market
equity (from CRSP) at the end of December of t − 1. For firms with more than one share class,
we merge the market equity for all share classes before computing Bm. Monthly decile returns are
calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.2
To form the momentum (R11 ) deciles, we split all stocks at the beginning of each month t based
on their prior 11-month returns from month t − 12 to t − 2. Skipping month t − 1, we calculate
monthly decile returns for month t, and rebalance the deciles at the beginning of month t + 1,
2
Following Davis, Fama, and French (2000), we measure book equity as stockholders’ book equity, plus balance
sheet deferred taxes and investment tax credit (Compustat annual item TXDITC) if available, minus the book value of
preferred stock. Stockholders’ equity is the value reported by Compustat (item SEQ), if it is available. If not, we measure stockholders’ equity as the book value of common equity (item CEQ) plus the par value of preferred stock (item
PSTK), or the book value of assets (item AT) minus total liabilities (item LT). Depending on availability, we use redemption (item PSTKRV), liquidating (item PSTKL), or par value (item PSTK) for the book value of preferred stock.

following Fama and French (1996). Liu and Zhang (2014) instead follow Jegadeesh and Titman
(1993), sort on the prior six-month return, skipping one month, and hold the deciles for the subsequent six-month period. We avoid the resulting six overlapping sets of momentum deciles with
only the one-month holding period. In any event, the momentum profits from the R11 deciles are
higher than those in Liu and Zhang, raising the hurdle for the investment model to explain.
To form the asset growth (I/A) deciles, at the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into
deciles based on I/A, which is measured as total assets (Compustat annual item AT) for the fiscal
year ending in calendar year t − 1 divided by total assets for the fiscal year ending in t − 2 (Cooper,
Gulen, and Schill 2008). Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1,
and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
We measure return on equity (Roe) as income before extraordinary items (Compustat quarterly item IBQ) divided by one-quarter-lagged book equity (Hou, Xue, and Zhang 2015).3 At the
beginning of each month t, we sort all stocks into deciles based on their most recent past Roe.
Before 1972, we use the most recent Roe computed with quarterly earnings from fiscal quarters
ending at least four months ago. Starting from 1972, we use Roe computed with quarterly earnings
from the most recent quarterly earnings announcement dates (Compustat quarterly item RDQ).
For a firm to enter the portfolio formation, we require the end of the fiscal quarter that corresponds
to its most recent Roe to be within six months prior to the portfolio formation, and its earnings
announcement date to be after the corresponding fiscal quarter end. Monthly decile returns are
calculated for the current month t, and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1.
Table 1 reports the descriptive statistics of the 40 testing deciles as well as the high-minus-low
deciles. From Panel A, the value premium (the average return of the high-minus-low Bm decile) is

From 1972 onward, quarterly book equity is shareholders’ equity, plus balance sheet deferred taxes and investment tax credit (item TXDITCQ) if available, minus the book value of preferred stock (item PSTKQ). Depending
on availability, we use stockholders’ equity (item SEQQ), or common equity (item CEQQ) plus the book value of
preferred stock, or total assets (item ATQ) minus total liabilities (item LTQ) in that order as shareholders’ equity.
Prior to 1972, we expand the sample coverage by using book equity from Compustat annual files and imputing
quarterly book equity with clean surplus accounting (Hou, Xue, and Zhang 2017).

0.47% per month (t = 2.07) with NYSE breakpoints and value-weights and 0.66% (t = 2.8) with
all-but-micro breakpoints and equal-weights. Panel B shows that the momentum premium (the
average return of the high-minus-low R11 decile) is much larger, 1.2% (t = 4.1) with value-weights
and 1.26% (t = 4.21) with equal-weights. The investment premium (the average return of the
high-minus-low I/A decile) is −0.37% (t = −2.22) with value-weights and −0.52% (t = −3.39)
with equal-weights (Panel C). The Roe premium (the average return of the high-minus-low Roe
decile) is 0.69% (t = 2.98) with value-weights and 0.95% (t = 4.13) with equal-weights.4

Components of the Fundamental Returns

This subsection describes firm-level accounting variables used to construct the fundamental return.
Variable Measurement
We largely follow Liu, Whited, and Zhang (2009) and Liu and Zhang (2014), but offer several
refinements. In the model, time-t stock variables are at the beginning of period t, and time-t flow
variables are over the course of period t. In Compustat both stock and flow variables are recorded
at the end of period t. As such, for the year 2010, for example, we take time-t stock variables from
the 2009 balance sheet, and time-t flow variables from the 2010 income or cash flow statement.
We measure output, Yit , as sales (Compustat annual item SALE) and short-term capital as
current assets (item ACT). Total debt, Bit+1 , is long-term debt (item DLTT, zero if missing) plus
B , is the ratio of total debt to
short-term debt (item DLC, zero if missing). The market leverage, wit

the sum of total debt and market equity (from CRSP). The tax rate, τ t , is the statutory corporate
income tax rate from the Commerce Clearing House’s annual publications. The physical capital,
Kit , is net property, plant, and equipment (item PPENT).
Departing from the prior studies, we offer several refinements in measurement. First, the prior
4
For completeness, Table 1 also reports that the Carhart (1997) four-factor model, the Fama-French (2015)
five-factor model, and the q-factor model largely succeed in capturing the value and investment premiums. However,
while the Carhart and q-factor models capture the momentum premium, the five-factor model cannot. Finally, while
the q-factor model captures the Roe premium, the Carhart and five-factor models cannot.

studies measure the depreciate rate of physical capital, δ it , as the amount of depreciation and amortization (Compustat annual item DP) divided by physical capital (item PPENT). We subtract the
amortization of intangibles (item AM, zero if missing) from item DP, before scaling the difference
by item PPENT. This measure is more accurate. In the data, the AM/DP ratio is on average 6.3%,
with a standard deviation of 13.9%. The AM/DP distribution has a long right tail. Its median is
0%, but the 75th, 90th, and 95th percentiles are 4.2%, 24.2%, and 39.7%, respectively.
Second, the prior studies measure investment, Iit , as capital expenditures (item CAPX) minus
sales of property, plant, and equipment (item SPPE, zero if missing). Despite its simplicity, this
Iit measure can violate the capital accumulation equation, Kit+1 = Iit + (1 − δ it )Kit , in the data.
At the portfolio level, across the 40 testing deciles, the difference is more than 5%, 15%, and 25%
of Kit for 14.2%, 1.2%, and 0.3% of the observations, respectively. The violation is more severe at
the firm level. The difference is more than 5%, 15%, and 25% of Kit for 35.5%, 18.2%, and 12.1%
of the observations, respectively. As such, we measure Iit directly as Kit+1 − (1 − δ it )Kit .
Finally, to measure the firm-level pre-tax cost of debt in a broad sample, the prior studies impute
credit ratings for firms with no credit ratings data in Compustat, and then assign the corporate
bond returns for a given credit rating to all the firms with the same credit rating. We instead
measure the pre-tax cost of debt as the ratio of total interest and related expenses (item XINT)
scaled by total debt, Bit+1 . Doing so increases the sample coverage by 12.7%.
Timing Alignment
We follow Liu and Zhang (2014) in aligning the timing of stock returns and accounting variables.
In particular, the momentum and Roe deciles are rebalanced monthly, but accounting variables in
Compustat are annual.5 We construct monthly fundamental returns from annual accounting variables to match with monthly stock returns. For each month, we take firm-level accounting variables
from the fiscal year end that is closest to the month in question to measure (flow) variables dated

Due to the large number of data items required to construct the fundamental return, we do not work with the
Compustat quarterly files because of their limited coverage for many of these data items.

13

t in the model, and to take accounting variables from the subsequent fiscal year end to measure
(flow) variables dated t + 1 in the model. Because the portfolio composition can change monthly,
the portfolio fundamental returns also change monthly.
While portfolio stock returns are in monthly terms and in monthly frequency, portfolio
fundamental returns are in monthly frequency but in annual terms, constructed from annual
accounting variables. To align the units, Liu and Zhang (2014) annualize monthly portfolio stock
returns to match with portfolio fundamental returns. This procedure creates potential timing
mismatch, as portfolio stock returns are for a given month, but fundamental returns are constructed
from annual accounting variables both prior to and after the month. To better align the timing, we
instead compound the portfolio stock returns within a 12-month rolling window with the month in
question in the middle of the window. In particular, we multiply simple gross portfolio stock returns
from month t − 5, t − 4, . . . , t, t + 1, . . ., and t + 6 to match with the fundamental return for month t.
Descriptive Properties of the Accounting Variables
Table 2 reports descriptive statistics for firm-level accounting variables in the fundamental return.
The mean physical investment-to-capital, Iit /Kit , is 0.38 in the full sample, with a large standard
deviation of 0.56. In the all-but-micro sample, the dispersion in Iit /Kit is dampened, with a standard deviation of 0.48. For comparison, the mean investment rate in current assets, Jit /Cit , is 0.14,
and its standard deviation is 0.39 in the full sample. Disinvestment in current assets is much more
frequent than that in physical capital. The 5th percentile of Jit /Cit is −0.3 and −0.2, with and
without microcaps, in contrast to −0.03 and 0.02 for Iit /Kit , respectively.
On average, physical capital accounts for only 38% of the sum of physical capital and current
assets in the full sample, and the 25th and 75th percentiles of this fraction are 18% and 55%, respectively. The average fraction is slightly higher, 44%, in the all-but-micro sample. This evidence
indicates the importance of accounting for capital heterogeneity in our estimation. The ratio of
sales to the sum of the two assets, Yit+1 /(Kit+1 + Cit+1 ), is on average 1.67, which is close to
14

the median of 1.51 in the full sample. Its standard deviation is only 1.05. The moments without
microcaps are close, with an average of 1.58, a median of 1.44, and a standard deviation of 0.99.
In contrast, microcaps have a large impact on sales-to-physical capital, Yit+1 /Kit+1 . Its mean
is 9.59, median 5.21, and standard deviation 14.46 in the full sample, and the moments are 6.74,
4.28, and 8.99, respectively, without microcaps. As such, Yit+1 /Kit+1 is much more skewed than
Yit+1 /(Kit+1 + Cit+1 ). The rate of physical capital depreciation is on average 20%, with a standard
B , is on average 0.26, with a standard
deviation of 13% in the full sample. The market leverage, wit

deviation of 0.22. For the pre-tax cost of debt, the mean is 10%, and the standard deviation 10%.
The moments without microcaps are largely similar.
Table 2 also reports pairwise correlations of the accounting variables. In the full sample, the
investment rate in physical capital, Iit /Kit , and the investment rate in current assets, Jit /Cit ,
have a positive correlation of 0.29. Iit /Kit has an autocorrelation of 0.26. However, Jit /Cit
has an autocorrelation of only 0.03, which is consistent with our assumption of zero adjustment
costs on current assets. Iit+1 /Kit+1 has positive correlations of 0.23 and 0.19 with two marginal
product measures, sales-to-physical capital, Yit+1 /Kit+1 , and sales over the sum of physical capital
and current assets, Yit+1 /(Kit+1 + Cit+1 ), respectively. However, Iit+1 /Kit+1 is uncorrelated with
Yit+1 /Cit+1 . Similarly, Jit+1 /Cit+1 have positive correlations of 0.22 and 0.18 with Yit+1 /Cit+1 and
Yit+1 /(Kit+1 + Cit+1 ), respectively, but a small correlation of 0.05 with Yit+1 /Kit+1 . The fraction of
physical capital in its sum with current assets, Kit+1 /(Kit+1 + Cit+1 ), has negative correlations of
−0.26, −0.53, and −0.31 with Iit+1 /Kit+1 , Yit+1 /Kit+1 , and Yit+1 /(Kit+1 +Cit+1 ), respectively, but
a positive correlation of 0.44 with Yit+1 /Cit+1 . The results without microcaps are largely similar.
Figure 1 reports the histograms of the accounting variables both at the firm level and at the
portfolio level. Aggregating firm-level variables to the portfolio level eliminates a great deal of heterogeneity. Firm-level Iit /Kit varies from −0.5 to 2.5, but the portfolio-level Iit /Kit lies between
−0.5 and one, with a concentration about 0.25. Firm-level Yit+1 /(Kit+1 + Cit+1 ) varies from zero

15

to 6.5, whereas its portfolio-level variable from 0.4 to 2.4. The firm-level Yit+1 /Kit+1 distribution is
even more dispersed, ranging from zero to 50, whereas the portfolio-level Yit+1 /Kit+1 ranges from
B , varies from zero to slightly above 0.4,
zero to only seven. The firm-level pre-tax cost of debt, rit+1

whereas the portfolio-level rit+1
mostly from zero to 0.15. The firm-level distribution of rit+1
has

a spike at zero, since we treat all firms without debt as having zero cost of debt.

GMM Estimation and Tests

We first replicate the key findings from the prior studies that estimate the physical capital model
at the portfolio level in Section 5.1. In Section 5.2, we report the results from the benchmark twocapital model estimated at the firm level. In Section 5.3, we quantify the impact of aggregation
by estimating the two-capital model at the portfolio level. Finally, in Section 5.4, we quantify the
impact of capital heterogeneity by estimating the physical capital model at the firm level.

5.1

Replicating the Prior Studies

Panel A of Table 3 reports the GMM estimation and tests for the physical capital model estimated
directly at the portfolio level, without constructing firm-level fundamental returns. Consistent with
the prior literature, the physical capital model does a good job in accounting for value and momentum separately, but fails to do so jointly. The failure in the joint estimation is reflected in the
parameter instability across the testing deciles when estimated separately. With value-weighted
returns, the marginal product parameter, γ K , is 0.168 with the book-to-market deciles, but 0.12
with the momentum deciles. For the adjustment costs parameter, a, the contrast is between 6.33
and 1.27. The average absolute high-minus-low error in the joint value and momentum estimation
is 6.97% per annum, which is substantially larger than 1.24% and 1.56% in the separate estimation.
The joint estimation failure is more severe with the equal-weighted testing deciles. The marginal
product parameter, γ K , is estimated to be 0.72, and the adjustment costs parameter, a, 63.4 with
the book-to-market deciles, in contrast to 0.129 and 1.34, respectively, with the momentum deciles.

16

In the joint estimation, γ K is 0.14, and a is 2.85. Consequently, the average absolute high-minuslow error in the joint value and momentum estimation is 12.24% per annum, which is substantially
higher than 3.79% and 0.14% in the separate estimation.
Figure 2 reports individual errors by plotting average predicted stock returns against average
realized stock returns across the value and momentum deciles as well as across all the 40 testing
deciles in the joint estimation. The physical capital model manages to fit the momentum premium,
but fails entirely to fit the value premium. With the value-weighted value and momentum deciles
jointly, the model predicts a negative value premium of −2.89% per annum, in contrast to 6.56%
in the data (Panel A). The pricing error is large, 9.45% (t = 2.83). The model also predicts a
momentum premium of 19.96%, overshooting the data moment of 15.48%, with an error of −4.48%
(t = −2.36). The failure in fitting the equal-weighted deciles is more severe. From Panel B, the
model predicts a large, negative value premium of −7.48%, in contrast to an observed premium of
8.95%, giving rise to a massive error of 16.79% (t = 4.96). The model implied momentum premium
is 24.55%, relative to the data moment of 16.86%, with an error of −7.68% (t = −3.61).
From Panels C and D, adding the asset growth and Roe deciles exacerbates the model’s failure
in explaining the value premium. With value-weighted returns, the model predicts a value premium
of −4.41% per annum, with a large error of 10.96% (t = 3.63). The model does well in predicting
a momentum premium of 16.78%, with a small error of −1.31% (t = −0.53). With equal-weighted
returns, the value premium is even more negative, −8.68%, giving rise to a massive error of 17.62%
(t = 5.61). The fit across the momentum deciles also deteriorates. The model predicts a momentum premium of 23.04%, with an error of −6.18% (t = −2.15). The model does well in fitting the
investment premium, −6.58% with value-weights and −6.23% with equal-weights, with small errors
of 1.47% (t = 0.68) and −1.05% (t = −0.38), respectively. However, the errors are larger for the
Roe deciles. The model predicts an Roe premium of 11.71% with value-weights and 16.92% with
equal-weights, and the errors are −3.44% (t = −1.4) and −4.87% (t = −1.96), respectively.

5.2

The Benchmark Estimation

Panel B of Table 3 reports that our benchmark two-capital model estimated at the firm level succeeds in explaining value and momentum simultaneously. A first indication is that the parameter
estimates are relatively stable across the testing deciles. In particular, with value-weighted returns,
the marginal product parameter, γ, is 0.152 with the book-to-market deciles, and 0.163 with the
momentum deciles. For the adjustment costs parameter, a, the contrast is between 5.37 and 3.74.
When estimating value and momentum jointly, the average absolute high-minus-low error is
only 1.06% per annum in value-weighted returns, and is a small fraction of 6.97% from the physical
capital model estimated at the portfolio level. With equal-weighted returns, γ is 0.156 and 0.157,
and a 3.6 and 2.65, with the book-to-market and momentum deciles, respectively. The average
absolute high-minus-low error is 1.84%, which is small relative to 12.24% from the physical capital
model. The mean absolute error is also smaller in the benchmark estimation than in the physical
capital model, 1% versus 2.86% with value-weighted returns, and 0.93% versus 4.05% with equalweighted returns. However, the benchmark model is still rejected by the overidentification test.
Finally, adding the asset growth and Roe deciles does not materially change the results.
Figure 3 plots average predicted stock returns from the benchmark estimation against average
realized stock returns across the testing deciles. The model performs well in all specifications, and
the scatter points are mostly aligned with the 45-degree line. In particular, when fitting valueweighted value and momentum deciles (Panel A), the model predicts a value premium of 5.56% per
annum (6.56% in the data), giving rise to a pricing error of 1% (t = 0.66). The model also predicts
a momentum premium of 16.6% (15.48% in the data), with an error of −1.13% (t = −0.37). The
errors are slightly larger in magnitude in equal-weighted returns (Panel B). The value premium is
6.86% in the model (8.95% in the data), giving rise to an error of 2.09% (t = 1.17). The momentum
premium is 18.47% (16.86% in the data), with an error of −1.6% (t = −0.5).
Panels C and D show that the errors from the benchmark model increase only slightly in mag-

18

nitude after adding the asset growth and Roe deciles. The scatter plots continue to align largely
along the 45-degree line with all the 40 testing deciles. With value-weighted returns (Panel C), the
model predicts a value premium of 4.96% per annum, with a pricing error of 1.6% (t = 0.46) and a
momentum premium of 16.22%, with an error of −0.75% (t = −0.25). The investment premium is
−4.63% in the model (−5.11% in the data), giving rise to an error of −0.48% (t = −0.23). Finally,
the Roe premium is 9.22% in the model (8.27% in the data), with an error of −0.95% (t = −0.39).
With equal-weighted returns (Panel D), the value premium is 4.85% per annum in the model,
with an error of 4.1% (t = 1.86). The momentum premium is 16.98% in the model, with an error of
only −0.11% (t = −0.04). The investment premium is −8.41% in the model (−7.28% in the data),
with an error of 1.13% (t = 0.71). Finally, the Roe premium is 10.13% in the model (12.05% in the
data), with an error of 1.93% (t = 0.84). As such, the benchmark model does a good job in jointly
explaining momentum, investment, and Roe premiums. Although the value premium continues to
be the most challenging for the benchmark model to explain, its improvement over the physical
capital model from the prior studies (Panel D of Figure 2) is substantial.

5.3

The Impact of Aggregation

We seek to understand the sources of the improvement of the benchmark model estimated at the firm
level over the physical capital model estimated at the portfolio level. This subsection quantifies the
impact of aggregation, whereas the next subsection quantifies the impact of capital heterogeneity.
Panel A of Table 4 reports the GMM estimation and tests for the two-capital model but implemented at the portfolio level. In particular, instead of constructing firm-level fundamental returns
per the benchmark estimation, we aggregate firm-level characteristics to the portfolio level first,
and then construct fundamental returns directly at the portfolio level. Comparing Panel A of Table
4 with Panel B of Table 3 shows that the parameter estimates are less stable from the portfolio-level
implementation. With the firm-level estimation, across the value-weighted value and momentum
deciles, the marginal product parameter, γ, varies from 0.152 to 0.163, and the adjustment costs
19

parameter, a, from 3.74 to 5.37 (Panel B of Table 3). In contrast, γ varies from 0.192 to 0.227,
and a from 2.52 to 5.62 with the portfolio-level estimation (Panel A of Table 4). Across the equalweighted value and momentum deciles, γ varies from 0.156 to 0.157, and a from 2.65 to 3.6 with
the firm-level estimation (Panel B of Table 3), whereas γ varies from 0.215 to 0.271, and a from
3.26 to 8.9 with the portfolio-level estimation (Panel A of Table 4).
Consequently, the portfolio-level estimation yields larger pricing errors when fitting the value
and momentum deciles simultaneously. With value-weighted returns, the mean absolute error is
1.56% per annum, and the average absolute high-minus-low return 2.75% with the portfolio-level
estimation (Panel A of Table 4). These errors are larger than 1% and 1.06%, respectively, with the
firm-level estimation (Panel B of Table 3). With equal-weighted returns, the mean absolute error
is 2.04%, and the average absolute high-minus-low return 4.91% with the portfolio-level estimation, both of which are higher than 0.93% and 1.84%, respectively, from the firm-level estimation.
Finally, the results are not materially changed once the asset growth and Roe deciles are added.
Figure 4 shows the scatter plots of average predicted stock returns from the portfolio-level estimation of the two-capital model versus average realized stock returns. The model struggles to
fit the value premium in the joint estimations with momentum. With value-weighted value and
momentum deciles (Panel A), the value premium is only 2.45% in the model, with an error of
4.11%, albeit insignificant (t = 1.4). In contrast, the momentum premium is 14.08%, with a small
error of 1.39% (t = 0.89). With equal-weighted value and momentum deciles (Panel B), the model
implied value premium is even negative, −0.79%, giving rise to a large error of 9.73% (t = 2.98).
The momentum premium is 16.94%, with a small error of −0.08% (t = −0.05).
Adding the asset growth and Roe deciles further increases the pricing errors for the value premium. With the 40 value-weighted deciles (Panel C), the value premium is only 1.56% per annum
in the model, and the error is 5% (t = 1.85), whereas the momentum premium is 11.93%, with
an error of 3.54% (t = 1.57). With the 40 equal-weighted deciles (Panel D), the value premium

20

is again negative, −1.13%, which gives rise to a large error of 10.08% (t = 3.32). The momentum
premium is 15.63%, with a small error of 1.24% (t = 0.51). Finally, the model does a reasonable
job in fitting the investment and Roe premiums. In particular, with the 40 equal-weighted deciles
(Panel D), the investment premium is −5.73% in the model, with an error of −1.55% (t = −0.7),
and the Roe premium is 9.74%, with an error of 2.31% (t = 1.03).
The contrast between Panel B of Table 3 and Panel A of Table 4 as well as that between Figures 3 and 4 quantify the impact of aggregation in the two-capital model. Figure 1 shows that the
amount of heterogeneity in accounting variables in the fundamental return is substantial at the firm
level. This heterogeneity is dampened greatly once the variables are aggregated to the portfolio
level. As such, estimating the two-capital model at the firm level is more “structural” than at the
portfolio level, making the parameter estimates more stable, and the pricing errors smaller when
explaining value and momentum simultaneously in the firm-level estimation.

5.4

The Impact of Capital Heterogeneity

In this subsection, we quantify the impact of introducing current assets as a production input in
addition to physical capital in the benchmark two-capital model. To this end, we report detailed the
GMM estimation results from the physical capital model (without current assets) implemented at
the firm level, and compare them with those from the two-capital model estimated at the firm level.
Panel B of Table 4 reports the point estimates and overall performance of the physical capital
model estimated at the firm level, departing from the prior studies that estimate this model at the
portfolio level. The firm-level estimation again yields relatively stable parameter estimates across
the value and momentum deciles. With value-weighted returns, the marginal product parameter,
γ K , varies from 0.049 to 0.071, and the adjustment costs parameter, a, from 0.58 to 3.11. With
equal-weighted returns, γ K varies from 0.038 to 0.057, and a from 0.29 to 3.26.
These γ K estimates are lower than those from the portfolio-level estimation (Panel A of Table 3).
The crux is that the firm-level distribution of sales-to-capital, Yit+1 /Kit+1 , is highly skewed, with
21

a mean of 9.59, a median of 5.21, a 5th percentile of 0.46, and a 95th percentile of 35 (Table 2). In
contrast, the portfolio-level Yit+1 /Kit+1 distribution is less dispersed, and shifted to the left, with a
mean of only 2.53, a median of 2.39, a 5th percentile of 1.23, and a 95th percentile of 4.21. The lower
γ K estimates in Panel B of Table 4 reflect the different Yit+1 /Kit+1 distribution at the firm level.
The γ K estimates are also lower than the estimates of the marginal product parameter, γ, in
the two-capital model estimated at the firm level. The reason is that the average product in the
two-capital model, measured as the ratio of sales to the sum of physical capital and current assets, Yit+1 /(Kit+1 + Cit+1 ), is much less dispersed than the average product in the physical capital
model, measured as sales-to-physical capital, Yit+1 /Kit+1 . Relative to the Yit+1 /Kit+1 distribution,
the Yit+1 /(Kit+1 + Cit+1 ) is also shifted to the left, with a mean of 1.67, a median of 1.51, a 5th
percentile of 0.3, and a 95th percentile of 3.81 (Table 2). As noted, the fraction of physical capital
in its sum with current assets, Kit+1 /(Kit+1 + Cit+1 ), is on average only 0.38, ranging from 0.07
in the 5th percentile to 0.88 in the 95th. As such, incorporating current assets better characterizes
the firm-level distribution of the average product and the fundamental return.
Incorporating current assets clearly helps the model’s performance. Without current assets,
when fitting the value-weighted value and momentum deciles jointly, Panel B of Table 4 shows that
the physical capital model yields a mean absolute error of 2.05% per annum and an average absolute
high-minus-low error of 3.25%. These errors are much larger than 1% and 1.06%, respectively, from
the two-capital model (Table 3). With equal-weighted deciles, the physical capital model yields a
mean absolute error of 2.69% and an average absolute high-minus-low error of 11.82%, in contrast
to 0.93% and 1.84%, respectively, from the two-capital model. Adding the asset growth and Roe
deciles does not change the results materially. With value-weighted returns, the mean absolute
error is 2.78%, and the average absolute high-minus-low error 4.17% in the physical capital model,
relative to 1.29% and 0.94%, respectively, in the benchmark model. With equal-weighted returns,
the mean absolute error is 2.79%, and the average absolute high-minus-low error 9.95% in the
physical capital model, in contrast to 0.91% and 1.82%, respectively, in the two-capital model.
22

Figure 5 shows the scatter plots of average predicted stock returns from the firm-level estimation
of the physical capital model versus average realized stock returns. The model struggles to explain
the average returns across the testing deciles, especially the value premium. With value-weighted
value and momentum deciles (Panel A), the value premium is 4.4% per annum in the model, with
an error of 2.16% (t = 0.35). The model also exaggerates the momentum premium to 19.81%, with
an error of −4.34% (t = −0.84). With equal-weighted value and momentum deciles (Panel B),
the value premium is negative and large, −10.29%, in the model, with a massive error of 19.24%
(t = 8.16). The momentum premium is 21.26%, with an error of −4.4% (t = −6).
Adding the asset growth and Roe deciles further increases the pricing errors for the value premium. With the 40 value-weighted deciles, the value premium is −2.85% per annum in the model,
with a large error of 9.14% (t = 3.36). The momentum premium is 20.57%, with an error of −5.09%
(t = −1.43). With equal-weighted deciles, the value premium is again negative, −9.45%, which
gives rise to a massive error of 18.39% (t = 8.29). The momentum premium is 26.37%, with a large
error of −9.5% (t = −3.9). Finally, the physical capital model estimated at the firm level does a
good job in fitting the value-weighted investment and Roe premiums, but not equal-weighted. With
the 40 value-weighted deciles, the investment premium is −6.91% in the model, with an error of
1.8% (t = 0.7), and the Roe premium is 8.65%, with an error of −0.39% (t = −0.14). However, with
equal-weighted deciles, the investment premium is −1.89%, with an error of −5.39% (t = −2.67),
and the Roe premium is 18.55%, with an error of −6.5% (t = −2.77).

The Dynamics of Factor Premiums

In this section, we use the fundamental return implied from the benchmark two-capital model estimated at the firm level to examine the dynamics of the value, momentum, investment, and Roe
premiums. Because the model parameters are estimated from matching only the average returns
across the testing portfolios, the dynamics are important in serving as separate diagnostics on the
model’s performance. We study calendar-time as well as event-time dynamics. Since the focus is
23

on comparing the dynamics of fundamental returns with those of stock returns, we winsorize the
firm-level fundamental returns at the 1–99% level each month to alleviate the impact of outliers.6
Finally, to construct the fundamental returns, we always use the parameter estimates from the
joint estimation of all the 40 testing deciles. We report both value- and equal-weighted results.

6.1

Correlations between Stock and Fundamental Returns

Taken literally, equation (5) implies that the stock and fundamental returns are equal ex post.
However, Liu, Whited, and Zhang (2009) document a correlation puzzle, i.e., the contemporaneous
correlations between the stock and fundamental returns are weakly negative, but the correlations
between the one-year-lagged stock returns and the fundamental returns are significantly positive.
Liu, Whited, and Zhang (2009) align the timing of annual stock returns from July of year t to
June of t + 1 with the fundamental returns constructed from the accounting variables at fiscal year
end of t and t + 1. We instead follow Liu and Zhang (2014) in constructing monthly fundamental
returns from annual accounting data. As noted, for each month, we take accounting variables from
the fiscal year end that is closest to the month to measure current-period variables in the model,
and to take accounting variables from the subsequent fiscal year end to measure next-period variables in the model. However, differing from Liu and Zhang, we match the fundamental returns for
the month in equation (aggregated to the portfolio level) with portfolio stock returns compounded
across the 12-month rolling window with the month in question in the middle of the window. This
rolling window measurement of portfolio stock returns helps resolve the correlation puzzle.
Table 5 shows that the contemporaneous correlations between the stock returns and the fundamental returns from the benchmark model are significantly positive. From Panel A, the time
series average of cross-sectional correlations of the two types of returns across all firms is 0.14, with
a p-value less than 1%. Excluding microcaps yields the same correlation. The stock-fundamental
6

We do not winsorize the firm-level fundamental returns in the GMM estimation and tests reported in Section 5.
Doing so complicates the computation of standard errors of point estimates because fundamental returns depend on
the estimates. However, implementing the winsorization will most likely reduce the pricing errors, and improve the
benchmark model’s performance in matching the average returns across the testing portfolios.

24

return correlation is 0.22 across the 40 value-weighted deciles, and 0.37 across the equal-weighted
deciles, both of which are highly significant. At the firm level, the lead-lag correlations are all
positive within the 12-month horizon, but turn negative at longer horizons. At the portfolio level,
the lead-lag correlations are all positive across the horizons within 60 months.
Panel B shows the time series correlation between the stock and fundamental returns for each
testing decile. The correlations are significantly positive for the extreme deciles and high-minus-low
deciles, but those for the middle deciles are weaker. In particular, the correlation is 0.32 for the
value premium with value-weights, and 0.54 with equal-weights. For the momentum premium,
the correlation is 0.18 with value-weights, and 0.28 with equal-weights. The correlation is 0.39 for
the investment premium with value-weights, and 0.44 with equal-weights. For the Roe premium,
the correlation is 0.21 with value-weights, and 0.34 with equal-weights. Finally, we emphasize
that equation (5) predicts perfect stock-fundamental return correlations across firms and across
portfolios. The correlations in Table 5, while mostly positive, are far from perfect.

6.2

Market States and Factor Premiums

Cooper, Gutierrez, and Hameed (2004) show that momentum is large and positive following nonnegative prior 36-month market returns (UP markets), but negative following negative prior 36-month
market returns (DOWN markets). Liu and Zhang (2014) show that the physical capital model
estimated at the portfolio level fails to explain this evidence. Our benchmark model makes some
progress in predicting procyclical momentum profits, but the procyclical variation is still weaker
than that in the data. We also extend the evidence to the value, investment, and Roe premiums.
From Panel A of Table 6, the value-weighted value premium is stronger following DOWN than
UP markets (identified with prior 36-month market returns): 16.68% versus 4.7% per annum. The
model succeeds in capturing the countercyclical pattern: 20.89% versus −0.02%. The variation is
more dampened with the equal-weighted value premium both in the data and in the model.
From Panel B, the momentum premium is stronger following UP than DOWN markets. With
25

the market states identified with prior 36-month market returns, the momentum premium is 20.12%
per annum following UP markets, but −9.39% following DOWN markets. In the model, the contrast is 16.9% versus 11.31%. The results for the equal-weighted momentum premium in both the
data and the model are quantitatively similar. As such, although the model explains the procyclical
variation of momentum, its magnitude is substantially weaker than that in the data.
Panel C shows that the investment premium is stronger following DOWN than UP markets.
With prior 12-month market returns categorizing the market states, the value-weighted investment
premium is −11.77% per annum following DOWN markets, but −3.14% following UP markets. In
the model, the contrast is only −6.69% versus −5.37%. The results for the equal-weighted investment premium are largely similar. As such, although going in the right direction, the model falls
short to explain the countercyclical variation of the investment premium.
Finally, Panel D shows that the Roe premium is stronger following UP than DOWN markets.
With prior 36-month market returns identifying the market states, the value-weighted Roe premium is 11.07% per annum following UP markets, but −6.02% following DOWN markets. In the
model, the comparison is between 7.07% and 1.94%. The equal-weighted Roe premium is 14.16%
following UP markets, but −0.11% following DOWN markets. The model predicts 10.44% and 8.8%
following the two market states, respectively. As such, although the model explains the procyclical
variation of the Roe premium, its magnitude is substantially weaker than that in the data.

6.3

Persistence of Factor Premiums

Prior studies show that value is more persistent than momentum. Fama and French (1995) show
that the value premium subsists for three to five years after the portfolio formation, whereas Chan,
Jegadeesh, and Lokonishok (1996) show that momentum profits are short-lived, positive within the
12-month horizon, but negative afterward. Liu and Zhang (2014) show that the physical capital
model estimated at the portfolio level explains the short-lived dynamics of momentum. We extend
the persistence evidence to the investment and Roe premiums, and show that the benchmark model
26

succeeds in explaining the short-lived nature of the momentum and Roe premiums as well as the
long-lived nature of the value and investment premiums.
Figure 6 reports the event-time dynamics of stock and fundamental returns of the high and
low deciles during 36 months after the portfolio formation. The value premium persists even after
three years, whereas the momentum premium converges to zero after only about ten months (Panels A–D). From Panels E and F, the value premium in the model is also long-lasting. Panels G
and H show that the model also explains the short-lived nature of momentum. Also, Panels I and
J show that the investment premium in the data is persistent, but less so than the value premium.
The value-weighted investment premium converges in about two years after the portfolio formation,
and the equal-weighted investment premium in three years. From Panels M and N, the investment
premiums in the model exhibit largely similar dynamics.
Finally, the Roe premium is as short-lived in the data as momentum (Panels K and L). In particular, the value-weighted stock returns of the high and low deciles start at 13.44% and 5.47% per
annum at month one, and converge to 10.45% and 10.32%, respectively, at month seven. Similarly,
the value-weighted fundamental returns of the two deciles start at 14.82% and 8.5% at month one,
and converge to 12.73% and 12.41%, respectively, at month eight. However, while the stock returns
of the two extreme deciles are indistinguishable afterward, the fundamental return of the low decile
outperforms that of the high decile. The results are largely similar with equal-weighted returns.
Figure 7 digs deeper into the driving force of event-time dynamics for the fundamental return by
examining the dynamics of its key components, including physical investment-to-capital, Iit /Kit ,
the average product of capital, Yit+1 /(Kit+1 + Cit+1 ), and the growth of marginal q, qit+1 /qit − 1.
From equation (7), the fundamental return decreases with current physical investment-to-capital,
but increases with the next-period average product and marginal q growth. From Panels A–F, the
dispersions in physical investment-to-capital and marginal q growth are both fairly persistent across
the value and growth deciles, and both contribute to the long-term dynamics of the fundamental

27

value premium. The dispersion in the average product is also persistent, but it goes in the wrong
direction in explaining the average returns. Its effect is dominated by the other two key components.
Panels G–L show that consistent with Liu and Zhang (2014), the marginal q growth is the key
driving force behind the short-term dynamics of momentum. The dispersions in the value- and
equal-weighted marginal q growth across the high and low deciles converge at about month 14, and
turn negative afterward (Panels I and L). Although going in the right direction in explaining the
average returns, the dispersion in the average product is more persistent. lasting for more than
three years. The dispersion in physical investment-to-capital is also persistent, and goes in the
wrong direction, but its effect is dominated by the two other components.
From Panels M–R, the physical investment-to-capital is the key driving force behind the longterm dynamics of the investment premium. Its dispersion across the extreme deciles subsists even
three years after the portfolio formation. Going in the wrong direction in explaining the average returns, the dispersions in the average product and marginal q growth are also persistent, but their impact is dominated by the physical investment-to-capital. Finally, Panels S–X show that the marginal
q growth is the key component driving the short-term dynamics of the Roe premium. Its dispersions
across the extreme deciles converge between month six and nine, and turn negative afterward. Although going in the right direction in explaining the average returns, the dispersion in the average
product is substantially more persistent. The dispersion in physical investment-to-capital is small.

6.4

Higher Moments

Table 7 compares the higher moments, including volatility, skewness, and kurtosis, of the stock
returns with those of the fundamental returns for each testing decile.
Several important patterns emerge from this table. First, fundamental returns are less volatile
than stock returns, echoing Cochrane’s (1991) results at the aggregate level. In particular, except for
the value-weighted value premium, which shows volatilities about 19.5% per annum for both stock
and fundamental returns (Panel A of Table 7), the fundamental volatilities of factor premiums are
28

often less than one half of their stock volatilities. For example, the contrast is 9.49% versus 20.98%
for the equal-weighted value premium, 13.19% versus 27.48% for the value-weighted momentum
premium, and 10.51% versus 30.34% for the equal-weighted momentum premium. The fundamental
return volatilities of individual deciles are also low relative to their stock return volatilities.
Second, the benchmark model largely fails to explain the negative skewness of momentum.
Daniel and Moskowitz (2016) document that momentum can experience infrequent and persistent
negative returns. Such momentum crashes yield a negative skewness for the momentum premium.
Panel B largely replicates their results. The value-weighted momentum premium has a skewness
of −1.83, but is only significant at the 10% level, and the equal-weighted momentum premium
has a skewness of −0.7, which is insignificant. However, the fundamental momentum premium
in the model shows a positive, albeit small, skewness of 0.57 with value-weights, and 0.62 with
equal-weights, and both are highly significant. In addition, Panel D extends the Daniel-Moskowitz
evidence to the Roe premium. The skewness is −0.84 with value-weights, and −1.95 with equalweights. Both are significant at the 10% level. In contrast, the model predicts insignificant skewness
of −0.24 and 0.3 for the value- and equal-weighted Roe premium, respectively.
Finally, the model does better in explaining the kurtosis of factor premiums. For the valueweighted value premium, the kurtosis is 3.4 for stock returns, relative to 4.37 for fundamental
returns. The contrast is 4.92 versus 4.81 for the equal-weighted value premium. The fundamental
returns also match the kurtosis of the stock returns for the investment premium, 3.72 versus 3.44
with value-weights, and 2.99 versus 3.28 with equal-weights. However, the fundamental returns
fall short for momentum, 4.71 versus 12.08 with value-weights, and 3.45 versus 11.39 with equalweights, as well as for the equal-weighted Roe premium, 3.82 versus 16.9. The model does better
for the value-weighted Roe premium, 4.35 versus 5.78.
Figure 8 plots the time series of stock and fundamental returns of the factor premiums. The
fundamental returns track the stock returns well, reflecting the economically large and statistically

29

significant correlations in Table 5. However, the fundamental returns clearly fall short in explaining
the extreme movements in the momentum and Roe premiums. In particular, the value-weighted
momentum premium experiences a crash of more than −150% in 2009, but its fundamental return
falls no more than 50% (Panel C). In addition, the equal-weighted Roe premium experiences a
crash of more than −150% in 1999, but its fundamental return falls less than 5%.

Conclusion

Prior studies show that while the investment model does a good job in fitting the value and momentum deciles separately, it fails to explain value and momentum simultaneously via structural
estimation. This paper shows that two innovations combine to go a long way in resolving this
empirical difficulty. Instead of forming fundamental returns from portfolio-level accounting variables aggregated from the firm level, we construct firm-level fundamental returns from firm-level
variables, and then aggregate firm-level fundamental returns to the portfolio level to match with
portfolio-level stock returns. In addition, we introduce current assets as a separate production
input from physical capital. Both innovations make the empirical specification more “structural,”
help stabilize the parameter estimates, and better describe cross-sectional expected returns.
The empirical success of the structural investment model suggests that it can be adopted more
broadly in practice. While factor models are effective in describing the common variation in the cross
section, facilitating practical risk management for portfolio managers, the cost of capital estimates
from factor models are noisy (Fama and French 1997). In response, a voluminous literature has
emerged to estimate the implied cost of capital from accounting-based valuation models (Gebhardt,
Lee, and Swaminathan 2001), with many applications.

However, the implied cost of capital

estimated as the internal rate of return does not seem to forecast one-period-ahead realized returns
(Easton and Monahan 2005, Guay, Kothari, and Shu 2011). In contrast, the fundamental returns
from our economic model provide a detailed, theoretical description of the one-period-ahead realized
returns. The fact that the fundamental returns are less volatile than the stock returns might be a
30

blessing in disguise. The evidence suggests that the expected fundamental returns might be a less
noisy proxy for the expected returns than the average realized returns. Future work can develop
the expected fundamental returns as a new class of the implied cost of capital.

Table 3 : GMM Estimation and Tests, the Physical Capital Model Estimated at the Portfolio Level versus the Benchmark
Two-capital Model Estimated at the Firm Level, January 1967–December 2015
This table reports GMM estimation and tests for the 40 testing deciles formed on book-to-market (Bm), prior 11-month returns (R11 ), asset growth
(I/A), and return on equity (Roe), separately and jointly (Bm and R11 , I/A and Roe, and all 40 deciles together). d.f. is the degrees of freedom
in the GMM test of overidentification. In Panel A, γ K is the technological parameter on the marginal product of physical capital as a fraction of
sales-to-physical capital, Yit+1 /Kit+1 . In Panel B, γ is the technological parameter on the joint marginal product of current assets and physical
capital as a fraction of the ratio of sales divided by the sum of the two assets, Yit+1 /(Kit+1 + Cit+1 ). a is the adjustment costs parameter of physical
capital. [γ], [γ K ], and [a] are the standard errors of the point estimates of these parameters. m.a.e. is the mean absolute error across a given set of
testing portfolios, |eH−L | is the average absolute high-minus-low error, and p is the p-value of the overidentification test across a given set of testing
portfolios. γ, γ K , [γ], [γ K ], m.a.e., |eH−L |, and p are in percent.

instance, the column denoted rit reports contemporaneous correlations, and the column rit−3 the correlations between three-month-lagged stock
returns and fundamental returns. Other columns are defined analogously. “vw-portfolios” means the 40 value-weighted deciles formed on book-tomarket, prior 11-month returns, asset growth, and return on equity, and “ew-portfolios” the 40 equal-weighted deciles. The correlations are time
series averages of cross-sectional correlations, and their p-values are calculated as the Fama-MacBeth (1973) p-values adjusted for autocorrelations of
up to 12 lags. Panel B reports for each of the 40 value- and equal-weighted decile as well as the high-minus-low decile, the time series contemporaneous
correlations between the stock and fundamental returns. Their p-values are calculated as the p-values of the slopes from regressing the stock returns
on the contemporaneous fundamental returns, and are adjusted for autocorrelations of up to 12 lags. The correlations that are significant at the
1%, 5%, and 10% levels are denoted with three stars, two stars, and one star, respectively. All the correlations are calculated after winsorizing the
firm-level fundamental returns at the 1–99% level each month. The first two rows in Panel A and the value-weighted results in Panel B are based
on the parameter values from estimating the benchmark model on all the 40 value-weighted testing deciles jointly, and the other results use the
parameter values from jointly estimating all the 40 equal-weighted testing deciles.

Table 6 : Market States and Factor Premiums

For each month t, we categorize the market state as UP (DOWN) if the value-weighted CRSP
index returns from month t − N to t − 1, with N = 12, 24, or 36 are nonnegative (negative). The
table reports the high-minus-low returns averaged across UP (DOWN) market states. r S denotes
the stock return, and r F the fundamental returns, both of which are in percent per annum. The
t-values are adjusted for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelations of up to 12 lags. We winsorize the
firm-level fundamental returns at the 1–99% level each month. The value-weighted results use the
parameter values from estimating the benchmark model on all the 40 value-weighted testing deciles
jointly, and the equal-weighted results use those from all the 40 equal-weighted testing deciles.

Table 7 : Higher Moments of Stock Returns and Fundamental Returns

For each decile, we report the volatility in percent, σ, skewness, Sk , and kurtosis, Ku , of its
stock returns, r S , and fundamental returns, r F . For each high-minus-low decile, the volatility and
skewness significantly different from zero and the kurtosis significantly different from three at the
1%, 5%, and 10% levels are denoted with three stars, two stars, and one star, respectively. The
p-values are based on 5,000 block bootstrapped samples, with each block containing 60 months. We
winsorize the firm-level fundamental returns at the 1–99% level each month. The value-weighted
results use the parameter values from estimating the benchmark model on all the 40 value-weighted
deciles jointly, and the equal-weighted results use those from all the 40 equal-weighted deciles.

High and Low Deciles

For 36 months after the portfolio formation, this figure plots physical investment-to-capital, Iit /Kit ,
sales over the sum of physical capital and current assets, Yit+1 /(Kit+1 + Cit+1 ), and the marginal
q growth, qit+1 /qit − 1, in annualized percent. Bm is book-to-market, R11 momentum, I/A asset
growth, and Roe return on equity. The blue solid lines represent the low deciles, and the red
broken lines the high deciles. The value-weighted (vw) marginal q growth use the adjustment costs
parameter value from estimating the benchmark model on all the 40 value-weighted deciles, and
the equal-weighted (ew) results use that from the 40 equal-weighted deciles.

To prove equation (4), we first show Pit + Bit+1 = qit Kit+1 + Cit+1 . We proceed with a guessand-verify approach. We first assume that this equation holds for period t + 1, and then show it
also holds for period t. It then follows that the equation must hold for all periods. We start with:
Pit + Bit+1 = Et [Mt+1 (Pit+1 + Dit+1 )] + Bit+1

Estimates of the Adjustment Costs on Current Assets

In this appendix, we examine an extended two-capital model with adjustment costs on current
assets. We lay out the model in Appendix B.1, and present its estimation results in Appendix B.2.

B.1

An Extended Model

We continue to build on the setup of the benchmark two-capital model described in Section 2.
However, we assume that the adjustment costs function depends on current assets and their
investment. We adopt the quadratic functional form, which is also separate in the two capital inputs:

Estimation Results

We continue to test the moment condition given by equation (6), in which the fundamental return
is given by equation (5), except that the current investment return is now given by equation (A21).
Table A1 reports GMM estimation and tests of the extended two-capital model. The table shows
that many estimates of the adjustment costs parameter, b, for current assets are insignificant, including all seven estimates with equal-weighted deciles and three out of seven with value-weighted
deciles. In particular, in the joint estimation of value and momentum, the b estimate is 1.4, with
a standard error of 0.06, with value-weights, but is 0.71, with a standard error of 0.97, with equalweights. With all 40 testing deciles, b is never significant: 0.3 with a standard error of 0.76 with
value-weights, and 0.16 with a standard error of 0.51 with equal-weights. The marginal product
parameter, γ, and the adjustment costs parameter, a, for physical capital are largely similar to
those in the benchmark estimation without b as a separate parameter.
The mean absolute errors, m.a.e., and average absolute high-minus-low errors, |eH−L |, are also
largely comparable. In particular, the m.a.e. is 0.77% per annum, and |eH−L | 0.89% with valueweights, and the errors are 0.78% and 1.03%, respectively, with equal-weights. These errors are all
smaller than those in the benchmark estimation. However, when all 40 testing deciles are included
in the joint estimation, the m.a.e. is 1.27%, and |eH−L | 2.21% with value-weights, and with equalweights the errors are 0.91% and 2%, respectively. While the mean absolute errors are comparable
with those in the benchmark estimation, the |eH−L | errors are larger.
Finally, Figure A1 reports detailed individual pricing errors by plotting average predicted stock
returns against average realized stock returns. Similar to the benchmark estimation reported in
Figure 3, the scatter points are all largely aligned with the 45-degree line. The errors in the joint
value and momentum estimation are smaller than those in the benchmark estimation, but the errors
from all 40 testing deciles are somewhat larger. The bottomline is that adding the extra parameter,
b, does not yield a significant improvement in the model’s performance. The evidence lends support
to our modeling choice of setting b = 0 in the benchmark estimation for parsimony.

Table A1 : GMM Estimation and Tests, the Extended Two-capital Model with Adjustment Costs on Current Assets
Estimated at the Firm Level, January 1967–December 2015
This table reports GMM estimation and tests for the 40 testing deciles formed on book-to-market (Bm), prior 11-month returns (R11 ), asset growth
(I/A), and return on equity (Roe), separately and jointly (Bm and R11 , I/A and Roe, and all 40 deciles together). d.f. is the degrees of freedom
in the GMM test of overidentification. γ is the technological parameter on the joint marginal product of current assets and physical capital as a
fraction of the ratio of sales divided by the sum of the two assets, Yit+1 /(Kit+1 + Cit+1 ). a is the adjustment costs parameter of physical capital,
and b is that of current assets. [γ], [a], and [b] are the standard errors of the point estimates of these parameters. m.a.e. is the mean absolute error
across a given set of testing portfolios, |eH−L | is the average absolute high-minus-low error, and p is the p-value of the overidentification test across
a given set of testing portfolios. γ, [γ], m.a.e., |eH−L |, and p are in percent.
