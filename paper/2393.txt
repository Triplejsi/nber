Prices of Single Family Homes Since 1970:
New Indexes for Four Cities

ABSTRACT

This paper uses data on nearly a million homes sold in

four metropolitan areas -Francisco -

- to

Atlanta,

Chicago, Dallas and San

construct quarterly indexes of existing home

prices between 1970 and 1986. We propose and apply a new
method of constructing such indexes which we call the

weighted repeat sales method (WRS). We believe the results
give an accurate picture of the actual rate of appreciation

in home prices in the four cities. The paper explains the
construction of the index, discusses the results and compares
them with the National Association of Realtors data on the

median price of existing single family homes for the period
1981 — 1986.

INTRODUCTION

By any measure, owner occupied housing is a very large

portion of national wealth. Of the total of 93.5 million
housing units in the United States in 1984, 61.5 million were

in single unit structures. The National Association of
Realtors reports that the mean price of an existing single

family home in 1984 was $86,000. If that number is correct,
the total value of the single family housing stock in the

United States that year was about $5.3 trillion. That same
year, according to the Flow of Funds Accounts, total
financial assets of the household sector were $6.6 trillion.
Since equity in owner occupied housing is a large

portion of national wealth, any real appreciation in the
value of single family homes is likely to make a significant

contribution to national saving. Assuming the figures above
are correct, a real increase of 2 percent in the value of
owner occupied housing represents over $100 billion of

private saving that is usually excluded from analyses of

saving behavior and the saving rate. In 1984, personal
saving (flow of funds basis) was $204.8 billion. Clearly,
an accurate measure of national saving requires an accurate
measure of appreciation in the value of owner occupied
housing.

In 1983, 65 percent of all households owned their homes,

and for most of those households the net equity in their

homes represents the bulk of their net worth. A number of

1

surveys have shown that nearly all home buyers view their
decision to buy at least in part as an investment decision.
For homeowners the total return to their investment consists
of the value of housing services, tax benefits and net
appreciation.

Despite its importance, we know surprisingly little

about the movement of single family home prices over the

years. Through 1985, the BLS calculated an index of
increases in existing home prices as a component of the CPI

"home purchase" price index. The series was based on actual
sales of properties that were financed with FHA mortgages.
The BLS index was widely criticized and has been

discontinued. An excellent analysis of the problems with the
index is Greenlees [1978].

The only currently published source of data on existing
home prices is the National Association of Realtors (NAR)

monthly report, Home Sales. That organization reports the
median price of existing single family homes quarterly for 54
metropolitan areas based on reports from its members; it has

become an accepted and oft cited source used by housing
market analysts, the banking community, appraisers and

journalists. 1 NAR median home prices are the only

1987. They report that in 1985, over 1.5 million reports
were received from over 400 Boards of Realtors.

2

data on existing home prices reported by the U.S. Commerce
Department in the annual Statistical Abstract of the United

States. They are also reported with great fanfare on the
front pages of many daily newspapers when released each
quarter.

Unfortunately, the Realtors' data are not useful for
purposes of analysing the performance of the housing market

or movements of housing prices over many years. First, they
have only been reported since 1981, making analysis over more

than half of a business cycle impossible. Second, the change
in median sales price is not a good measure of appreciation.

As the NAR itself points out, "movements in sales prices
should not be interpreted as measuring changes in the cost of

a standard home. Prices are influenced by changes in cost
and changes in the characteristics and size of homes actually
sold." 2

2. Ibid. pg 2

This paper uses data on nearly a million homes sold in
four metropolitan areas ——

Francisco ——

to

Atlanta,

Chicago, Dallas and San

construct quarterly indexes of existing home

prices between 1970 and 1986. We propose and apply a new
method of constructing such indexes which we call the
weighted repeat sales method ——

hereafter

referred to as the

WRS method. We believe the results give an accurate picture
of the actual rate of appreciation in home prices in the four

3

cities. This paper will explain the construction of the
index, discuss the results and compare them with the NAR data
for the time period since 1981.

The availability of accurate data on housing price

movements is important for another reason. It was argued in
an earlier article (Case, [1986)) that actual or reported

increases in housing prices may affect the expectations of

home buyers and sellers. It was argued that such a process
was in part the cause of the rapidly escalating prices in the

Boston area from 1983 to 1986. In a companion paper, we use
the WRS indexes to test for the efficiency of the housing
market.

HOUSING PRICE INDEXES: REPEAT SALES VS. THE HEDONIC APPROACH

The most significant problem with using changes in
median sales price as a measure of appreciation is that the
characteristics of the units sold may change from period to

period. For example, if for some reason in a given period a
disproportionate number of high priced homes were sold,

median price would rise even if no single property

appreciated at all. In addition, as real incomes rise over
time, the quality of new homes is likely to rise.

Since

those new homes ultimately become "existing" homes, the
quantity and quality of existing housing purchased by the

median buyer is also likely to increase over time. If it
did, then median home price would rise even if individual

4

properties were not appreciating.
To correct for this problem, two basic approaches have

been used. First, a number of studies have used hedonic
price indexes that statistically "control" for differences in
the characteristics of units in various saxnples,3 A second

3. For a discussion of the hedonic technique see Griliches
[1971], Rosen [1974], Chinloy [1977] and especially Palmquist
[1979].

group of studies have used data on properties that have
actually sold more than once during the period in question.

The hedonic approach requires a large quantity of data
on individual units sold including their characteristics.

The sales price is regressed on a set of variables that
describe the unit —— number of rooms, square feet of interior
space, lot size, quality of construction, condition and so

forth. The regression coefficients can be interpreted as
implicit attribute prices. For example, the addition of a
room may add $17,000 to the value of a property.

The hedonic approach can be used to construct a price

index in two ways. First, a separate regression can be run

on data from each time period. The estimated equations can
then be used to predict the value of a "standard unit" in

each period. The characteristics of the unit being valued,

thus, do not change over the estimating period. This is a
fixed weight method similar to the one used to construct the

5

Consumer Price Index. Alternatively, a single equation can
be run on the pooled data from sales in all time periods.

Inclusion of a time dummy for the period of the sale will
allow the constant term to shift over time reflecting
movement in prices, again controlling for characteristics. 4

4. The second approach has the disadvantage of constraining

attribute prices to be the same in every period. The first
method allows the individual attribute coefficients (implicit
prices) to change each period.

An alternative to the hedonic regression approach is to
use data on properties that have actually sold more than

once. Advocates of the repeat sales approach argue that it
more accurately controls for characteristics of properties
since it is based on observed appreciation of actual housing

units. 5 The hedonic approach must first estimate the

5. See for example Wyngarden [1927], Wenzlick [1952] and
especially Bailey, Muth and Nourse [1963].

implicit value of each attribute. The precision of those
estimates determines how well the hedonic equation actually

controls and predicts. That depends in turn on how well the
data capture the actual characteristics and quality of the

unit. The repeat sales approach does not require the
measurement of quality; it only requires that the quality of

6

individual homes in the sample be constant over time.

The most important drawback to using the repeat sales

method is that it wastes data. That is, only a small percent
of all housing transactions in most data sets reappear. None
of the data on single sales is used. Moreover, it may be
that the set of houses sold repeatedly is not representative
of the general population of homes.6

6. These points are made by Mark and Goldberg [1984]

This paper uses the repeat sales method for several

reasons. First, the data sets in question are very large.
In each of the four cities we identify many thousands of

repeat sales. We lose very little precision by throwing out

observations. Second, the time period —- 16 1/2 years --

is

long enough that we capture units that sell more frequently

and less frequently. Almost all of our repeat sales are on
properties that sold only twice. Properties that sold five
or more times were excluded from the sample. Finally, since
we had information on characteristics and quality of units,

we were able to exclude observations when we knew that
quality had changed between the first and second sales.

One final argument that has been used to support the
hedonic approach is that it allows for the identification of

depreciation. The actual appreciation of an individual
property is the difference between gross appreciation and

any depreciation that occurs as the property ages. There are

7

forces that naturally tend to push down on housing prices

over time. First, of course is physical deterioration.

Another is that tastes may change over time. The
characteristics of houses match the preferences of people at

the time it was built. Presumably, new houses being built
now capture today's tastes while older homes do not. By
including a year built variable, the hedonic approach can
capture the affect of the age of a unit on its value.

We would argue that it is not desirable to wash out

all depreciation. The overall rate of return to an
individual investment in a single family house depends on
many things -- any explicit rent, imputed rent, tax benefits,

and net appreciation. If we assume that a house is
physically maintained so that physical deterioration is not
the cause of the depreciation, then stylistic or even
structural obsolescence should not be removed in calculating

total appreciation. For investment purposes, a buyer/owner
is interested in the net increase or decrease in value that

is not the result of physical deterioration. Physical

deterioration can be controlled. Most other causes of
depreciation cannot.

In our data set, we have a variable for "condition"

which allows us to identify properties that have not been

maintained. Those properties are excluded from the sample.

CONSTRUCTION OF THE WRS INDEXES

8

The Data:

The basic data sets used to construct the WRS index
contain large amounts of information (address, price,
structural characteristics, condition and so forth) on

recorded sales of just under a million individual housing

units. Sample sizes are given in Table 1. The data were
gathered in four metropolitan areas, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas

and San Francisco. The San Francisco data are actually drawn
from the east part of the metropolitan area including
Oakland, Berkeley, Piedmont, Hayward and the rest of Alameda

county. The data from the other three cities are drawn from
the entire metropolitan areas.

The data from Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas as well as

data from before 1979 from San Francisco were obtained from
the Society of Real Estate Appraisers (SREA) Market Data

Center in Atlanta, Georgia. Property sales from the San
Francisco area between 1979 and 1986 were obtained from the
California Market Data Cooperative, a licencee of SREA.
The data were collected by members of the SREA who
include many real estate agents, bank officers and

appraisers. When a transaction occurs (at the closing)

members fill out a long data sheet and submit it to SREA. In
this regard, the procedure is identical to the one employed

by the National Association of Realtors. We have no
information about how representative either the NAR or the

SREA memberships are. Since the SPEA data contain a very
large number of sales, and since they contain data on

thousands of sales of both high priced and low priced
properties, we assume that they are a representative group of
transactions. 7

7. A subset of the SREA data was first used by Case [1979j
to estimate the impact of Urban Homesteading on neighborhood

properties in a study done for HUD. Selection by Census
tract found what seemed to be a uniform geographic
distribution across the four cities being studied.

Information on the sheets includes the exact street
address of the property, the sales price, the closing date,

as well as between 25 and 40 characteristics of the property

depending on the city and time period. To complete the data
set we had to merge 16 separate files.

Identifying Repeat Sales: The process of identifying repeat
sales involved several steps. First, an exact match was done
on the address fields. Next, properties identified as
anything other than a single family home, such as a

condominium or a cooperative unit, were dropped. Third,
pairs were excluded if there was evidence that the structure

had been physically altered. This was done by checking the
number of total rooms, the number of bedrooms, the indicated
condition, and whether any rooms had been "modernized."

The condition and modernization variables were recorded
differently in the various data sets that had to be merged.

11

For condition, most used excellent, good, average, fair and

poor. Because the ratings were subjective and given by
different people often many years apart we decided to ignore

small changes. Thus, a property that went from good to
average was retained. Any property that indicated a jump of
two categories between sales, such as a drop from good to

fair, was excluded. All properties listed in poor condition
in either period were excluded on the grounds that the rate
of physical deterioration was likely to be high and that
there well could be unobservable problems reflected in price.
Whether the kitchen or a bathroom had been ttmodernizedll

was also recorded on the form in a variety of ways.

Records

where a modernized room was indicated were flagged and if a
flag appeared at the time of the second sale and one was not
present at the first sale, the record was dropped.
A total of 39,267 clean pairs of sales were extracted.

Of that number, 57 observations appeared to be data entry
errors; the two sales prices were different by close to a

factor of ten. With those excluded, the final sample sizes
are listed in Table 1. The richest sample was, not
surprisingly, Chicago with 15,530 repeat sales. The smallest
was Dallas with 6,669.

The WRS Method: This section contains a brief
discussion of the econometric method used to construct the

WRS index. The appendix contains greater detail and specific
regression results.

12

The index construction we propose is a modification of
the repeat sales housing index construction method of Bailey,

Muth and Nourse [1963] (hereafter, BMN). Their method
involves running a regression where the ith observation of

the dependent variable is the log of the price of the ith
house at its second sale date minus the log of its price on
its first sale date. The independent variables consist only
of dummy variables, one for each time period in the sample

except for the first. For each house, the dummy variables are
zero except for the dummy corresponding to the second sale
(where it is +1) and for the dummy corresponding to the first
sale (where it is -1). If the first sale was in the first

period, there is no dummy variable corresponding to the first
sale. The estimated coefficients are then taken as the log

price index (the value of the log price index at the first
time period is zero; it is the base period for the index) .8

8. This method is equivalent to another used in Case [1986].
If you assume that:

P. (1+r1)D1 (1+r ) D2(1+r )D3. .. . . (l+rN)
where P = the initial sales price
=

the

rt =

a dummy variable which is equal to 1 if

period i is between the first and last sales
and 0 otherwise.

Using this method, the estimated coefficients are

13

transformed growth rates, r, that are then cumulated into
an index that is identical to the the BMN index.

Bailey, Muth and Nourse argued that their method of
constructing price indexes from repeat sales data was more

efficient than earlier repeat sales methods. If each
observation of the dependent variable is equal to the change
(over the interval between sales of that house) of a city-

wide log price level of houses plus a house—specific noise
term, and if this noise term is uncorrelated across houses
and through time and it has a constant variance, then indeed,

by the Gauss-Markov theorem, their log price index is the
best linear unbiased estimate of the log of the city-wide
price level.

We disagree, however, with the assumption that the

variance of the error term is constant across houses. We
think that this variance is likely to be related to the
interval of time between sales, and we shall show some

evidence that this is so. There is likely to be a drift
through time of individual house values due, for example, to
random differences in the amount of upkeep expended across

houses, or random changes in neighborhood quality. With the
original BNN method, homes sold after long time intervals
have great influence on the index relative to homes sold over
short time intervals. We thought such long time interval

observations should be given less weight in index

construction. For the purpose of our WRS construction, we

14

thus assumed that the log price of the ith house at time t
is given by:

Pi_t =C t +H it+

N
it

where Cis the log of the city-wide level of housing prices
at time t; H.

j for all t; and N1is a sale specific random error that

has zero mean and variance&' for all i and is serially
uncorrelated.

Here, H.represents the drift mentioned above in
individual housing value through time. What we want to
estimate is the movement of C, the city—wide level of prices.
Consistent with these assumptions, the WRS

method

consists of three stages. In the first stage, the BMN

procedure

is followed exactly, and a vector of regression

residuals is calculated. In the second stage, a weighted
regression of the squared residuals in the first stage
is run with a constant term and the time interval between

sales on the right hand side. The constant term of the

second stage regression is an estimate of 2
term is the estimate of

,

and the slope

In the third stage a generalized
h

least squares regression (weighted) is run by first dividing
each observation in the first stage regression by the square
root of the fitted value in the stage two regression and
running the stage one regression again.

The detailed results of these procedures are discussed

in the appendix. We now turn to a discussion of the indexes

15

themselves. We are convinced that they present as accurate a
picture as can be estimated of the city—wide movement of
existing home prices for the four areas.

HOUSING PRICES IN FOUR CITIES: 1970 - 1986

Figure la—d plots the WRS indexes, nominal and real, for

the four cities. Table 2 summarizes the overall change in
prices from the first quarter of 1970 to the second quarter

of 1986. While substantial variance in performance can be
seen across the cities all saw home values at least keep pace
with inflation as measured by the CPI.

In Atlanta and Chicago existing home prices remained
remarkably constant in real terms over the 65 quarters of the

sample period. While nominal prices nearly tripled, so did
consumer prices in general. Real increases in both Atlanta
and Chicago averaged less than one percent per year.

The increases recorded in Dallas and San Francisco stand

in marked contrast. Property values in Dallas rose an
average of 2.2 percentage points per year faster than the CPI
while real increases in San Francisco averaged 4.3 percent

per year. Sustained real appreciation rates that high are
remarkable. Real home prices in Dallas increased by 43.0
percent. In San Francisco they nearly doubled.
Tables 3 and 4 look at two shorter periods of time.

The first corresponds to the inflation/recession cycle of
1970:1 -

1975:1.

1974/1975 recession to the period of very high interest rates

in early 1981. The later period was also one in which the
baby—boom generation began to enter the housing market.9

9. For a good discussion of the demographics of housing
demand see Joint Center for Urban Studies of MIT and Harvard
University, Housing Outlook Reports, published every five
years.

Between 1970 and 1975, housing price increases were

modest and fairly uniform. In all four cities, price
increases totaled between 40 and 54 percent over the five

years while prices in general rose 39 percent. San Francisco
led the pack with real increases of 2.2 percent per year.

The six year period 1975:1 to 1981:1 show anything but

uniform increases across the cities. First, of course, the
well known California boom is evident. Over the six years,
annual appreciation of homes in the San Francisco sample

averaged 9.4 percent in real terms. Meanwhile, real prices
in Atlanta were dropping nearly 7 percent —— an average of
1.1 percent per year.

While prices in Chicago increased at about the rate of
inflation, Dallas was experiencing a boom of its own although

not as substantial as San Francisco's. Homes in Dallas
appreciated a total of 34.2 percent, or an average of 5.0
percent per year in real terms.

The period from 1981 to 1986 will be discussed in the

24

next section.

Comparison with The National Association of Realtor's Data
Comparison of the WRS indexes with the median sales

price of existing single family homes as published by the
National Association of Realtors is presented in Table 5 and

Figure 2a-d. Since the NAR only began publishing their data
in the first quarter of 1981, the comparison is made for the

period 1981 to 1986. For Chicago and Dallas we have complete
series from the first quarter of 1981 to the second quarter

of 1986. The NAR stopped publishing data on Atlanta in the
third quarter of 1985 and did not publish a figures for San

Francisco in the first and second quarters of 1986. Thus,
the Atlanta comparison stops in 1985 and the San Francisco
comparison runs through the third quarter of 1986.

At the outset it is important to review what is being

compared. The NAR publishes the median sales price of
existing single family homes. That figure depends on the
characteristics of homes that are sold in a given period as

well as on the level of prices. The NAR is careful to point
out that their numbers are not meant to be used as an index

of appreciation. Thus, the comparison should not be read as
a criticism of the NAR or of its data.

Despite the warnings of the NAR, the popular press often

interprets their figures as appreciation. The Boston Globe
and the New York Times in the last few years have run
numerous headlines announcing the latest figures from the NAR

SAN FRANCISCO —WRS vs NAR

FIGURE

without carefully interpreting them.

Except for Chicago, the NAR data increase significantly
faster than the WRS indexes, indicating that for those three

cities the "mix" effect is large. In Atlanta, NAR median
home price rose 44.6 percent between 1981 and 1985, while
according to the WRS index, existing homes appreciated only

28.2 percent. In real terms at average annual rates, median
price in Atlanta rose 3.7 percent per year, while housing
actually appreciated at 1.0 percent per year, less than 1/3
as fast.

In San Francisco, the difference is most pronounced.
The NAR data show 45.5 percent nominal growth over 5 1/2

years, while the WRS index shows only 25.8 percent

appreciation. In real terms, the NAR data show 2.8 percent
annual growth while our index indicates that property values

increased only 0.2 percent per year in real terms. The real
increase over the entire 5 1/2 year period was less than 1

percent. In Dallas, the story is the same. The NAR data
show a rise of 48.4 percent, while individual unit prices
rose an average of only 31.0 percent.

In Chicago, however, the two series move very closely

together. As Figure 2c shows, the lines cross in virtually
every year. Both the WRS and NAR indexes show an increase of
3.4 percent per year before adjusting for inflation. In real
terms both indexes show average annual declines of just under
1 percent.

These results suggest that the mix of properties sold in

31

Chicago from period to period has not changed while the mix
of properties sold in Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco from
period to period has shifted, as you might predict, in favor
of higher value properties.

While this paper is meant only to present and describe

the data, a number of explanations are possible. Table 6
presents data on employment growth and income growth for the

four metropolitan areas between 1981 and 1986. While total
employment grew 25 percent in Dallas, 27 percent in Atlanta
and 4 percent in San Francisco, it fell over 8 percent in

Chicago. At the same time while real personal income grew
about 20 percent in Dallas and Atlanta and 11 percent in San
Francisco, it only grew 3.7 percent in Chicago. It is
reasonable to expect the mix of homes sold to favor
increasingly expensive properties when incomes are rising.

Seasonality: Another interesting comparison between the
NAR data and the WRS indexes is that the NAR data seem to

have much more seasonality in them. Neither one of the
series is seasonally adjusted. The NAR states in its monthly
publication, "there is a modest degree of seasonal variation

in reported selling prices. Sales prices tend to reach a
seasonal peak in July and then decline moderately over the
next three months before experiencing a seasonal upturn."
The third quarter downturn is dramatic and consistent in
the Dallas NAR index (see Figure 2c) and quite pronounced in
the median price data for San Francisco (Figure 2d) and

Chicago (Figure 2b). While it is slightly less evident in

Atlanta, it is clearly present. Much less seasonality seems
to be present in the WRS indexes. This suggests that most of
the seasonal variation in median sales price is due to
changes in the mix of homes sold and not due to seasonal

fluctuation in home values. If true, this is certainly
important for both home buyers and home sellers to know. It
is consistent with notions of efficient markets.

A third quarter drop in median price due to a change in
the mix of homes sold means that a higher portion of lower

value properties sell in the third quarter. If home purchase
is associated with the school year cycle as conventional

wisdom suggests, then this could be true for at least two

reasons. First, movers who coordinate their moves with the
school cycle are likely to be families with children.

Families with children buy more housing than families without
children.

An income effect is also possible. For example, two
parent families with children have household incomes more

than twice as high as nonfamily households.l0 If for any

10. U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Current
Population Reports, Series P-60, No. 146

reason, those families or households that coordinate their
moving with the school calendar have higher incomes than
families or households that do not, then more high value

properties will be sold in the second quarter than in the

34

third quarter and median sales price will appear seasonal
even if actual housing prices are not changing at all.

In addition, among people who do coordinate their moves
with the school cycle, those with lower time values will

search longer. Those with lower time value earn lower wages
and, all else equal, are likely to buy less housing. Again,
median home price will move seasonally because of seasonal
differences in the mix even if values are not changing over
the calendar.

Real Home Values Can and Do Fall
It is important to note that the WRS data do show a
number of prolonged periods of real decline in home values:

Atlanta from 1973 to 1978; Chicago from 1979 to 1985; Dallas
from 1972 to 1976; and San Francisco from 1980 to 1983.
Nominal declines are, however, rare.
In his earlier piece, Case [1986] argued that home

prices were likely to be rigid or sticky downward in nominal
terms since people often pull their properties off the market
when they cannot get "what the property is worth." Many
people predicted a crash in home prices in California in

1981. While real prices fell sharply, nominal prices fell
only slightly. The number of sales fell dramatically. 11

11. It may also be the case that actual sales price
overstates the real purchase price if subsidized seller

financing is involved. It has been argued that take-back

35

financing at subsidized rates disguised price declines in

California in the early 1980's. Properties that indicated
non—conventional financing were eliminated from our data.

FUTURE RESEARCH

We believe that we have carefully constructed as good an
index of appreciation in single family home prices for our
four cities as one can construct given the heterogeneity of

the housing stock. What remains now is to analyse those

series. Why do they behave the way that they do? Can we
explain the sharp rises from 1975 to 1981? Were the
California and Dallas booms in part "speculative bubbles?"
In a companion piece now being prepared, we will use

several variations on the WRS index to test formally for the
efficiency of the market for single family homes.

APPENDIX

As we reported in the text, a three step regression

procedure was used to estimate the indexes presented. In the
first stage, the log price of the second sale minus the log

price of the first sale was regressed on a set of dummy
variables, one for each time period in the sample except the

first. For each observation the dummys are zero in every
quarter except the quarters in which the two sales occurred.

For the quarter of the first sale, the dummy is -1, and for

the quarter of the second sale, the dummy is +1. From the
first stage, a vector of residuals is calculated.
In the second stage, a weighted regression of the

squared residuals from the first stage is run on a constant

term and the time between sales. The constant term of the

second stage regression is an estimate of 2 ——

whereNis

the variance of the house specific random error. The slope
coefficient is an estimate of the variance of the quarterly
change in the Gaussian random walk term.

In the third stage, a generalized least squares

regression (weighted) is run that repeats the stage one
regression after dividing each observation by the square root
of the fitted value in the second stage.

The results of the three stages are described in Table

Al. The slope coefficients in the Step 2 regressions are
signficant at the 1% level in all of the four cities. Both
coefficients had the expected signs in all four cities. We

conclude that the model provides a good estimate of the
random error in individual selling price.

Note that the the slope coefficients are large enough in
all cases that the generalized least squares correction we
employ will make a substantial difference to the results.

For example, in the Atlanta regression, the slope coefficient

is .00076. If a long time passed between sales of a
particular home, say 50 quarters, the fitted value in this
regression is .048, about five times the fitted value of the
regression for a house for which the interval between sales

was only a one quarter, .0098. Thus, our method will give
substantially less weight to such long sales interval data
than does the original BNN method.
Changing the weight given to the observations has a

substantial effect on the quarter to quarter change in the

index. The correlation coefficients between the quarterly
first difference of the BMN log index and the WRS log index
is .984 for Atlanta, .975 for Chicago, .858 for Dallas, and

.872 for San Francisco. There is less effect of the weights
on the year to year change in the index, here the correlation
between the BMN log index and the WRS log index is .993 for
Atlanta, .993 for Chicago, .969 for Dallas and .973 for San
Francisco.

The results in Table 1A show that when a house is sold
there is substantial noise in price that is unrelated to the

interval between sales. An estimate of the standard
deviation of this noise may be obtained by dividing the

39

constant term in the step 2 regression by 2 (since the houses
were sold twice) and taking the square root. The estimates of
implied by Table Al are quite consistent across the cities
studied. For Atlanta, it is 7.00%; for Chicago, 6.78%, for
Dallas, 6.33%; and for San Francisco, 5.39%. The estimates
have small standard errors. It should be remembered that some
of this variability in price is due to factors other than the

noise in the sales process. Some of this is due to
unmeasured quality changes that take place between sales.
Table A2 a—cl present coefficeints and standard errors

for all four cities. We calculated standard errors for the
log index, for first differences of the log index, and for

annual differences in the log index. The level of the index
is quite well measured, the first difference of the index is
not terribly well measured, and the annual difference of the

index is fairly well measured. One way of describing how
well these variables are measured is to compute the ratio of
the standard deviation of a variable to the average standard

error for that variable. For the log index in levels, this
ratio is 13.87 for Atlanta, 24.52 for Chicago, 9.94 for
Dallas, and 28.03 for San Francisco/Oakland. Thus, we can
make satisfactory statements about the level of house prices
in the cities. For the quarterly difference of the log
indexes, the ratio is 1.64, 1.61, 1.35, and 1.54

respectively. For the annual difference of the log index,

the ratio is 2.73, 3.99, 2.90, and 3.62 respectively. We can
make fairly accurate statements about the annual change in

log housing prices.

The accuracy of the results for the quarter to quarter

changes is disappointing. However, we doubt that it is
possible to measure them with greater accuracy. Many housing
price indexes purport to show monthly changes. Some of these
indexes involve smoothing of data to produce reasonable
looking results.

The obvious way to test for the random walk property of
housing prices would be to take first differences in the

indexes and check for serial correlation. If true housing
prices are random walks their first differences would be

serially uncorrelated. However, the indices are estimates of
the true housing prices, and as such there is noise in the

estimates (due to theAh and N terms in equation 1 above).
Because of this house—specific noise, there may be serial

correlation in the first differences of the index even if
housing prices are random walks. There can be either positive
or negative serial correlation, depending on the timing of
the sales of the houses that are used to make up the index.l

1. Of course, since our data is in effect quarterly averaged,

we expect a serial correlation coefficient (and coefficient
of the lagged value in the kind of autoregressions described
below) of 0.25.

With our estimated (nominal) indexes, the estimated
first—order serial correlation coefficient tends to be

49

negative. If the quarter to quarter change in the log price
index is regressed on the lagged quarter to quarter change
and a constant term, then the coefficient of the lagged

change is -.351 for Atlanta, +.240 for Chicago, -.0200 for

Dallas, and +.174 for San Francisco. The serial correlation
is unaffected by the inclusion of quarterly seasonal dummies
in the regression (and the seasonal dummies are, except for

Chicago, statistically insignificant at the 5% level). The
coefficient of the lagged quarter-to-quarter change in the
regression with seasonal dummies is —.351, +.346, -.028, and
+.

197 respectively.

It was noted above that for quarterly differences the
standard error of the estimate is large relative to the

standard deviation of the quarterly difference itself. If
the error in measuring the index is a stationary stochastic
process, then its first difference must be negatively
serially correlated, and hence the presence of this error

might account for the negative serial correlation. Longer
differences (which are measured better) tend to be positively

correlated. If the one—year change P—P_is regressed on the

one—year—lagged one year change I—P ,

the

coefficients on

the lagged value are 0.218, 0.413, 0.449, and 0.349
respectively.

Despite the measurement error problems, we regard the
WRS index we have constructed as very useful for the testing
of market efficiency. In our companion paper (Case and

Shiner [1987], we run regressions of changes in prices of

50

individual houses on lagged changes in the index. For each
observation the lagged changes in the index are computed only
from lagged data, from before the first sale of the

individual house in that observation. Doing this necessitated
estimating for each quarter the entire time series WRS index
up to that
quarter.
