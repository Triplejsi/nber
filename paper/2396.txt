Why Are Wages Cyclical in the 1970s?

ABSTRACT

This paper investigates cyclicality in real wages between 1969 and 1982,
using 14 years of data from the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics. First, it
investigates the extent to which movements in and out of the labor market
created apparent wage cyclicality. Second, it investigates whether cyclical
movements of workers between heterogeneous wage sectors within the labor market
created cyclicality. Little evidence of the first effect is found. The second
effect is much more important, and cyclicality clearly occurs in the movement
of workers between different labor market sectors. However, sector selection
is not correlated with wage determination. Thus, individual wage change
estimates of cyclicality need to control for sector location, but need not
account for sector selection. The third conclusion of the paper is that
cyclicality is present in real wages even within sectors over this time period,
and is the result of both cyclicality in overall wage levels (cyclicality in
the constant term in wage equations), as well as in the coefficients associated
with particular worker characteristics.

I. INTRODUTJON
The relationship between the business cycle and wages has been a much

discussed topic. Keynes suggested that real wages should be countercyclical,
since decreases in the real wage should induce increases in employment.

However, early empirical evidence found that aggregate wages moved procy-

clically (Dunlop [1938]). More recent empirical work utilized time series
analysis to suggest that aggregate real wages since the 1940s show little
evidence of any cyclicality (Neftci [1978], Sargent [1978], Altonji and
Ashenfelter [1980] or Geary and Kennan [1982]).

However, the latest studies

have indicated that, at least in the decade of the

1970s, aggregate wages

showed a clear procyclical pattern (Bils [1985], Blank [1985], Coleman [1984],

or Raisian [1983].) These later studies typically use broader wage definitions', which somewhat accounts for their divergent results. However, Coleman
repeats several earlier studies on equivalent data from the 1970s and finds

evidence of procyclical wage movements. These more recent studies also make a
point of using micro data. They uniformly conclude that cyclical effects are
apparent in the micro data as well as in the aggregate wage data.

Given that predictions regarding wage cyclicality emerge from a wide
variety of economic models, it is important to understand the nature of the
apparent wage cyclicality that has been observed in recent years. This paper
further investigates cyclicality in real wages between 1969 and 1982, focussing

on two issues. First, changes In the composition of the labor force over the
cycle can create cyclical wage changes. This paper investigates cyclical
changes in worker selection in and out of the labor market as well as in

movements between heterogeneous labor market sectors. As we shall see below,
if such selection issues are not explicitly addressed empirically, then even
micro data estimates of wage changes may exhibit spurious wage cyclicality.
While I find little evidence of significant selection in and out of the labor
1

market (at least among white men), there is clear evidence that aggregate wage
estimates are affected by cyclical worker movements between heterogeneous
sectors; but because there is little correlation between sectoral choice and

wage determination, micro data estimates are not affected by these movements.
Second, once compositional labor market changes are accounted for, there
are two ways by which individual wage changes may be associated with changes in

macroeconomic activity. There may be a direct relationship to overall wage
levels, manifest by cyclicality in the constant of the wage equation over time,

which can be measured by including a cyclical variable in a wage change

equation. This is the approach taken by all existing research. Alternatively,
this paper also explores the possibility that there may be cyclical changes in
the entire wage/skill relationship (cyclicality

evidence that both types of cyclicality have occured in recent years.
MARKET
II. MODELLING THE CYCLICALITY IN AGGREGATE WAGES IN A HOMOGENEOUS LABOR

The basic labor market model used in this paper is the classic human
capital wage equation for individual i in year t,
(1)

wit = ln(W±t) =

+

Xt + u + Ejt,

where W represents the wage rate, X is a vector of individual characteristics
which affect productivity and hence determine wages, 'r is a vector of related

coefficients, which represents the weights these characteristics are given in
the wage determination process, u is the cyclical effect on individual i's
variables
wage, and s is a random error term. The X's often include additional

which are institutionally important in the labor market, although they may or
may not have direct productivity impacts

(such as union status or region. )2

Define the cyclical effect as

u = f(Xt)ut,

where

f(Xjt) =

2

+ Xit6.

Ut is the pure cyclical effect, while f(Xt) is the effect associated with the
characteristics vector X. (1) can be rewritten as
(2)

Wit ( + &0Ut) + Xit(t + &ut) + it
=

B0t + Xt13t + it•

If wages are determined homogeneously throughout the labor market, differing
only across the variables included in the vector X, then equation (2) represents
the wage determination process for any individual i.
Let Wt represent the mean wage in period t, calculated from among all

labor force participants, with X being the vector of mean characteristics for

these workers. The change in aggregate wages between periods is

ot+l ot)
-

+ (Xt÷iJ3÷1 + Xt(13t÷1 -

XtI3t)

13t + (Xt+i - Xt)13t÷1

The three terms on the right hand side of equation (3) decompose the change in
aggregate mean wages into three parts: a homogeneous time-varying effect which

occurs for all demographic groups; changes in the wage coefficients which
differ across demographic groups; and aggregation effects, resulting from
changes in the means of the X's.

The third term will be nonzero when there is selectivity in the workers

who move in and out of the labor force over the cycle. For instance, assume
period t represents a recession period and period t+l a boom period. If
additional workers are attracted into the labor market in boom periods who have
lower average skills than the mean worker in a recession period, then this
implies that

X. for all elements of the vector X.3 In this case, the

third term on the right hand side of (3) is clearly negative, and is a measure
of the aggregation bias. If the 13's are procyclical (13t÷l > 13) then measured
cyclicality in aggregate wages will understate the true cyclicality in in-

dividual wages. In fact, depending on the relative size of these three terms,
it is possible that aggregate wages could even appear to be countercyclical.
3

That research which investigates cyclicality in aggregate wage data obviously
suffers from an inability to separate aggregation bias effects from true
cyclical effects.

In contrast, the micro data research cited above typically estimates
individual wage change equations, including changes in
one of the independent variables.

the unemployment rate as

The sign and significance on the change in

unemployment is taken as a measure of the cyclicality imbedded in wages. Note

that there are two problems with this approach. First, these equations can
typically be estimated only from data on those persons who are stably employed

over several time periods. As Moffitt, Keane and Runkle [1987] note, focusing
only on workers who do not leave the labor market does not guarantee unbiased

estimates of wage cyclicality. Assume we can characterize the decision to
participate in the labor market as
(4)

*
P it =

Zjwt

+

u,

where P is a measure of the utility comparison between labor market
participation and nonparticipation for individual i, Z is a vector of individual
characteristics, ¶1 is a related coefficient vector, and u is a random error

term. If the error term in (2) is correlated with u, the error in (4), then
estimating (2) (or some transformation of it such as individual wage changes)

will result in biased estimates of the J3t•4 Thus, in order to accurately
estimate the true 13's (and their underlying cyclicality), one must empirically

account for labor market participation choices made by workers.
Second, the inclusion of a simple change in unemployment rates in an
individual wage change equation essentially measures only

the cyclicality in the

first term of equation (3) (by parameterizing it as a change in unemployment
rates), and ignores the second term, which allows for changes over time in the

determinants of wages. There are good theoretical reasons to expect that
macroeconomic cycles will have different impacts on workers with different
4

labor market characteristics. In a world where both capital and labor are
completely replicable in the short run and where there are no economies or
diseconomies of scale in the production process, wage determination should

remain unaffected by levels of production. If demand doubles, the firm can
immediately duplicate its production process and double its output with no

change in the nature of production. However, if these conditions are not met,
then the nature of the production process itself will change as activity levels

vary. This can readily affect the value of worker skills to the firm, changing
the wage/skill relationship which human capital models describe.

If capital is not immediately replicable in the short run, any attempt to
increase production in response to rising demand will require more intensive

utilization of existing capital. Multiple shifts or speeded—up production

lines are common in times of high economic growth. These changes might
increase the value of coordinational activities within the firm, thus increasing

the value of formal training and/or management experience. For workers on the
production line, if the increase in production is accomplished by a greater
division of labor, job de-skilling could occur as workers are given more

limited tasks. Formal training, or job experience could become less important
to the firm. Alternatively, if equivalent additional labor is not available to
the firm, the value of experience and training could increase, as attempts are
made to increase the productivity level of the existing work force.

Realize that this analysis assumes that wages reflect the current product-

ive value of the worker to the firm. A variety of institutional arrangements
might prevent changes in the value of the worker to the firm from being

translated into immediate wage changes. The effect of worker/firm wage
contracts - -

both

explicit and implicit - -

has

been much explored in the

literature. There may clearly exist incentives for both workers and firms to
provide "wage smoothing" of some nature, breaking the link between point-in5

-time wages and the marginal product of

the worker. In this case, wage levels

and their determinants will vary less over the cycle, although in many models
the decrease in wage variation over the cycle is offset by an increase in

employment variability. Thus, the greater the extent of wage smoothing in the
labor market, the more one would expect to find aggregate wages affected
primarily by changes in labor market participation and composition.5
However, if wage smoothing is not complete,

or if it is not available in

certain sectors of the labor market, one might find changes over the cycle in
the estimated coefficients of the entire wage equation.

This effect can be

modelled by allowing the vector 13 to vary over time.

III. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON WAGE CYCLICALITY IN A HOMOGENEOUS LABOR MARKET
This section will present evidence on the components of aggregate wage

cyclicality. I will also provide evidence on the extent to which accounting for
labor market participation decisions changes estimates of wage cyclicality.

Throughout this section, I assume that a single wage equation adequately
characterizes the entire labor market, an assumption which will be dropped in
the next section when I investigate the effect of sectoral heterogeneity on
wage cyclicality.

SOME COMMENTS ON DATA

the longitudinal nature of this data set, but use it as a series of consecutive

cross sections. While it might at first appear desirable to estimate cyclicality from individual wage change equations, this creates potential problems.

am interested in describing the sources of recent aggregate wage cyclicality.
As noted above, individual wage change equations

necessarily focus only on

those individuals who remain in the labor market for several consecutive years.
For persons who enter or leave the labor market, or who are unemployed for long
6

periods of time, Continuous wage observations are not available.

Omitting

these people from the sample may eliminate the most likely sources of aggregate

cyclicality. Similarly, as we shall discuss below, workers who switch jobs
between heterogeneous sectors may experience changes in their whole wage
determination process, a difficult process to model at the individual level if
there are different wage/skill regimes in different sectors. As a result of
these problems, I take a different approach in the estimates below, which
provides consistent estimation of the effects I seek to explore, but which may
not always be fully efficient since it ignores some of the cross-time information available on those individuals who remain in the labor market for multiple
periods.

I initially treat the PSID as a series of 14 sequential cross-sections. I
utilize the data for all male household heads in each designated year between
the ages of 20 and 65 who report labor market earnings. I use the entire PSID
sample to create these yearly data sets, which is composed of a random sample

and a low-income sample. (I make separate estimates for black and white men;
without using the low-income sample, I would not have enough observations on
black men to be able to investigate them separately.) As a result, sample

weights must be used to weight my sample back to a random sample. These are
provided within the PSID. All numbers and estimates reported here are based on
weighted data. These weights change over time as the demographics of the PSID
sample and the demographics of the country change.6
Wages are defined as average hourly earnings, calculated by dividing total

labor market income over the year by total hours of work. As a result, they
include overtime and second-job income.7 All wage data is transformed to 1981

dollars. Note that by using a measure of wages based on annual earnings, I
thus include in my sample of employed workers any individuals who had some labor

7

income over the year. This should decrease the effect of changes in labor
market participation on labor force composition.8
EtIPIRICAL RESULTS

Using the 14 cross-sections described above, I estimate 14 separate OLS

wage equations for white men and for black men. Columns 1 and 2 of Table 1
describe the data used in these estimations.

Within this aggregate data there is no evidence of cyclicality in any of

wages can be explained by workers with different skill characteristics moving
in and out of the labor market.

The results in Table 1 indicate that changes

in mean worker characteristics show virtually no cyclicality over time.11
The coefficients resulting from the 14 OLS wage equations are presented in
columns 1 and 2 of Table 2.12

i have 14 estimates of each coefficient. The

mean of these 14 estimates is presented first, followed by the mean of their
standard errors.

I also report the standard deviation of the coefficients over

the 14 years, which provides a comparison of the average variation in the

estimates across the years to the average within-year standard errors. There
is clearly some significant variation in the coefficient estimates over the
years --

the

cross-year standard deviation is typically higher than the mean

within-year standard error for all the coefficients.

The cyclical patterns in these coefficients are estimated by regressing
the change in these coefficients against the percent change in GNP, similar to

equations (5) and (6) above.13 The estimated relationship between percent
growth in GNP and the change in the coefficients over time is shown in the

fourth row for each variable. The earlier discussion noted both the possibility
of overall shifts in the wage level (cyclicality in the constant) as well as

cyclicality in the other wage determinants. The results in Table 2 demonstrate

both effects. While there is evidence of procyclicality in the constant for
white men (a homogeneous upward shift in wage levels as the economy expands),
there is also evidence that an increase in macroeconomic activity increases the
effect of age and age squared (a proxy for experience) in determining wages.
The coefficients on education and union status show little evidence of cyclical-

ity. For black men only the education coefficient shows mildly procyclical
effects.

The implication of these results is that most of the cyclicality in
aggregate wages appears to be explained by shifts in the constant and the
9

coefficients of the wage equation,
changes in the characteristics

with little effect of aggregation bias due to

of workers over the cycle. To further test this

additional
proposition, I estimate a set of wage equations for each year with an
term included to adjust for selectivity

in and out of the labor force. This is

a standard econometric technique, first developed by Heckman [1974]. Briefly,

a probit equation (as specified

in (4)), representing the probability of labor

market participation is initially

estimated using all data, from both workers

and nonworkers. The results of this probit are used to calculate a selection

This picture is slightly

less clear for black men. In 6 of the 14 regressionS, there is significance on

the selectivity term. (The mean coefficient and mean standard error indicate
insignificance, but the variance in the coefficients over the years is large.)
This indicates that there is some effect on wages due to the selectivity of who

moves in and out of the labor market among black men. However, the regression
coefficient relating changes in GNP to changes in the estimated selectivity
coefficients indicates that there is no cyclicality in these coefficients.
10

I am not the first to research this issue, Moffitt, Keane and Runkle
[1987] investigate the effects of selectivity into the labor market, using
several relatively complex models of individual wage changes, corrected for

selectivity bias. In contrast to my results, they do find this correction
makes a difference --

in

fact, worker movements in and out of the labor market

appear to increase the procyclicality in aggregate wage measures. There are at
least two reasons why these results differ from mine.

First, they use a

different data set, with observations only on young men, a group which may be

more prone to labor force participation changes. Second, they have point-intime estimates of wages and labor market participation, rather than the

annualized measure available in my data set.15 As noted above, one would
expect reater compositional changes with higher-frequency data.

However, even

after these selectivity effects are accounted for, they find evidence of
further wage cyclicality, similar to the results presented here.
The conclusion is that there are no clear cyclical shifts in worker
characteristics over time in this data, and thus little evidence of aggregation
bias due to changes in the skill levels of labor market participants. Given no
evidence of correlation between labor force participation and

wages, especially

for white men, micro data estimating procedures which ignore this issue should
provide consistent estimates of wage cyclicality.
IV. HETEROGENEITY IN TIlE WAGE/SKILL RELATIONSHIP BENEEN SECTORS

Although there is little evidence of aggregation bias in this data induced
by labor market participation changes, there is another

way in which labor

market composition may change over the cycle. Until now I have

the

assumed that

relationship between wages and worker skills is the same for all workers at

a point in time. However, if wage determination is heterogeneous across
different sectors of the labor market, and if workers move between these
sectors in a cyclical manner, then apparent cyclicality in the determinants of
11

wages may be due to changes

in sectoral composition. To see this, assume that

the labor market is composed of two types

of jobs, each of which utilize worker

skills differently. Call these manufacturing and non-manufacturing jobs. For

ed as "pure" cyclical effects. 13t and 13t have become implicated in the
aggregation bias. Part of their observed cyclicality may be due to cyclical
changes in 13m and I3 but part may also be due to cyclical changes in the

weights, em and en. In fact, in the absence of any cyclicality in the underly-

ing coefficients mt = 13mt+l and 13nt =
13nt+1)' there may still be cyclicality
in the aggregate coefficients, I3 and

as em and 0n change over time. The

primary implication of this section is that if there is heterogeneity in the
wage/skill determination process across sectors and if the mix of workers
between sectors changes over the cycle, it will be almost impossible to
separate out the effects of aggregation bias from the effects of true cyclicality, unless one can clearly identify and estimate separate wage functions for

each heterogeneous group. Even micro data studies which estimate individual
wage change equations may be affected by this problem. If job shifts between
sectors are not explicitly accounted for in the estimation, then cyclical
variables (such as the unemployment rate) may pick up the effects of these
omitted variables, reflecting cyclical shifts between wage regimes on the part
of individual workers, rather than actual cyclicality in wage rates.

IV. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE

ON LABOR

MARKET HETEROGENEITY AN]) CYCLICALITY

As an initial exploration of the possibility of sectoral heterogeneity in
the labor market, I estimate OLS wage equations for three different categories

of workers from each successive cross-section of workers. Because of my concern
regarding aggregation of workers whose wage/skill relationship may vary I
separate all professional, managerial, and administrative employees (hereafter
referred to as PMA workers) and estimate a wage equation for them. With the
remaining non-PMA workers, I create two groups, one composed of all workers in
manufacturing industries, and the other composed of non-manufacturing employ-

ees.'7 Separate wage regressions provide 14 annual observations on each
13

coefficient for each group. The means of the data (over all individuals and
all years) in each of the groups are shown in Table 1, columns 3 through 5 for
white men and columns 6 through 8 for black men.

As Table 1 indicates, PMA workers have much higher average hourly earnings,
than do other workers, but there is no sign of cyclicality in their wages.

However, both manufacturing and non-manufacturing wages show significant

cyclicality among both white and black men. Although there is no cyclicality
in their aggregate wages, PNA workers appear to have procyclical education
levels and mild countercyclicality in unionization rates (which are low among
these workers). Ilanufacturing workers show evidence of procyclicality in
education levels, and non-manufacturing workers show evidence of procyclicality

in age and age squared. Given previous evidence that significant shifts in and
out of the labor force do not occur, these results are consistent with a story
in which the manufacturing sector in boom times attracts and/or keeps workers
with more education than the typical manufacturing worker, but less education

than the average PMA worker, raising educational levels in both sectors. From
the nonmanufacturing sector, manufacturing attracts and/or keeps workers who
match the average age in that sector, but who in low-growth times move into the

nonmanufacturing sector, lowering average age in that sector. Thus, while the
aggregate measures of worker characteristics in columns 1 and 2 indicated
little shift over time, disaggregation into sectors indicates that workers
appear to be moving between sectors over the cycle in such a way that the
characteristics of the mean worker in each sector changes with macroeconomic
activity.

The coefficients from the wage regressions for each of these three groups

are presented in Table 3. Table 3 is essentially the sector-specific analogue
of Table 2, which estimated a single wage equation for all workers. As Table 3
indicates, there are significant differences in the wage/skill determination
14

process among workers in each of these three labor market groups.1-8 For
instance, the return to education among black PHA workers is very high (perhaps

indicating a scarcity of educated black men.) The return to experience (here
proxied by age19) is highest in manufacturing for blacks and in PHA jobs for

whites. Unionization clearly has the strongest impact on nonmanufacturing wages
for both black and white workers.
Table 3 also investigates the cyclical pattern in these coefficients.

Among white men, the coefficient on education shows procyclical effects

(greater returns to education in boom times) in manufacturing. In nonmanufacturing, returns to age are procyclical and the union coefficient is counter-

cyclical. Surprisingly, the constant is significantly countercyclical for both
manufacturing and nonmanufacturing workers among whites. Thus, although
aggregate wage patterns are procyclical, there is a countercyclical homogeneous
effect on wages in these two sectors, which is then offset by other cyclical

effects. Among black men, there is less evidence of cyclicality on these
coefficients.

In short, compared to Table 2, when wages are estimated

separately by sector, many new cyclical patterns in the coefficients emerge.
The differences in wage coefficient estimates between the three labor
market groups, the cyclicality in the means of worker characteristics within
the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors, and the differences in the
cyclical patterns of wage determinants between Tables 2 and 3 indicates there

are changes in the sectoral composition of the labor force over the cycle. If
wages are correlated with sectoral choice, estimating wage equations without
accounting for the sectoral choice process may result in biased coefficient
estimates, and apparent cyclicality in wage determinants may merely reflect
cyclicality in sectoral movements as discussed above.

Of the studies cited earlier which present evidence of wage cyclicality
over the l970s, few deal with the problem of heterogeneous wage determination
15

between sectors. Bus explicitly considers the role of job switches in wage
changes and concludes that virtually all of the cyclicality in his estimates is
coming from individuals who change jobs between time periods. Moffitt, Keane
and Runkle estimate a limited selection model among manufacturing workers and

find evidence of selectivity effects. To fully explore this issue, I implement
a joint estimation procedure of a three-way sectoral choice model and three
simultaneous sectoral wage equations.2°
Assume that workers choose between three labor market possibilities:
employment as a PMA worker, or work in the manufacturing or nonmanufacturing

sector. Designate these three labor market groups as P. N, and N. Observing a
worker in sector P is equivalent to knowing that sector P is preferred to N and

that P is preferred to N. If wage levels are correlated with sectoral choice,
then one wants to estimate wages for PMA workers jointly accounting for the two
sectoral preferences they have demonstrated.
Let the utility gained by a worker in sector j be denoted Uj.

Then

preferences among three sectors can be completely characterized by three equations (it is assumed that these equations are for individual i at time t):

two. In other words, U*pN = U*PN

Because wage determination is assumed to differ between these labor market

groups, there are three possible wage regimes an individual can enter:

there is a correlation between sector selection and wage levels, then

estimating equations (15) - (17) alone will produce biased estimates of the 13

coefficients, since the expected value of the 's will be correlated with the
p's and hence will not equal zero. To correct for this intercorrelation, one
must estimate the wage equations jointly with the sector selection equations.
For any individual i, the likelihood that he or she is observed in sector
P earning W1,, can be written as

Assuming that the 's and p's are jointly normally distributed, Appendix 1
provides the statistical details as to how these 3-element probability functjons
can be written in terms of univarjate and bivariate conditional normal func-

tions. Estimation of the resulting likelihood function across all individuals
(equation A9 in Appendix 1) will provide estimates of the three vectors of wage
coefficients (13p, 6M' and 6N)' the standard errors of these three wage equations

°M' and c5N), two vectors of sectoral choice coefficients ('l and 62, from

which 63 can be derived), and 5 correlation coefficients (p12, the correlation

between p1 and p2; r1EP, the correlation between p1 and c; rlN, the correla-

Significant parameter estimates of these correlation

coefficients would indicate that the sectoral choice and sectoral wage equations
17

are correlated and must be jointly estimated to produce unbiased estimates of
the 13's.

The results of estimating this joint sectoral choice/wage model for white
men on each of the 14 years are presented in Table 4. As before, I show the
mean of the 14 estimated coeffients and their standard errors, as well as the
standard deviation of the coefficients over the 14 years, and the regression
coefficient that correlates changes in these coefficients to changes to GNP.
The coefficients on the sectoral choice equations are consistent with what one

might expect. Less educated and older men are more likely to be manufacturing
workers than nonmanufacturing workers, and are also more likely to be non-

manufacturing than PMA workers. Manufacturing jobs are less likely to be
located in the south or the west.

There is little evidence of cyclicality in the determinants of choice

between the PNA and manufacturing sectors. However, countercyclicality in both
age coefficients in the choice of manufacturing over nonmanufacturing implies
that more young workers move into or remain employed in manufacturing in boom

times. Procyclicality in the constant in the choice manufacturing over
nonmanufacturing and countercyclicality in the constant of PMA over manufacturing implies that the manufacturing sector draws workers away from both other
sectors in boom times.

Comparing the wage coefficients in Table 4, with joint wage/sectoral
choice estimation, to those in Table 3, where each sector's wage is independent-

ly estimated, there are few differences. Not only are estimated values
similar, but so are the patterns of cyclicality. In nonmanufacturing, there is
cyclicality in the coefficients on age, union status and the constant; in
manufacturing there is mild cyclicality on the education coefficient, while PHA
workers show little evidence of any cyclical effects.

18

The reason for this similarity is clear at the bottom of Table 4, where the
mean estimates of the correlation coefficients

resulting from this joint

estimating procedure are presented. These are uniformly small and insignificant, and none of them demonstrate any cyclical effects. (In no equation
for any year do any of the estimated correlation coefficients show significance.) This indicates that there is no correlation between the errors in the
wage equations and the errors in the sectoral choice

equations, which means that

sectoral choice, although cyclically affected, need not be accounted for in
order to derived unbiased estimates of the wage determinants in each sector.
This implies that estimated cyclicality in the wage coefficients in manufacturing and nonmanufacturing shown in Table 3 reflect actual changes in the wage
determination process over the cycle in these sectors, and are not contaminated
by sector selection.

The results in Table 4 indicate that

some sector-specific cyclicality

occurs due to movements between sectors (as shown by cyclicality in worker
characteristics in manufacturing and nonmanufacturing), while some of it occurs
because of actual cyclical changes in the determinants of wages within each

sector. To further explore the issue of movement between sectors, I investigate
both the nature of cross-sectoral movements

over these 14 years, as well as the

extent to which wage cyclicality occurs among those who do not change sectors.
Using the longitudinal nature of the PSID, I construct 13 samples, each a
two-year matched sample containing two years of information on all male
household heads who participated in the labor market for both years. Thus the
first sample contains all male heads who work in both 1969 and 1970, while the
last sample is composed of all male heads who work in both 1981 and 1982. With
these two-year samples I can compare wage changes and labor market movements
across each two year period using data from the same individuals.

19

There are six possible inter-sectoral moves that a worker can make between

years. These are listed at the top of Table 5. Using the two-year matched
samples I derive 13 observations on the percent of workers who make each type of

sectoral move in each two-year period. As Table 5 indicates, the largest flows

are clearly in and out of the non-manufacturing sector -- on average 4.9% of
all workers move into this sector each year (2.9% from PMA jobs and 2.1% from
manufacturing jobs), and 5.6% of all workers leave it for work in another

sector. The ratio of intersectoral movers to total workers in each two year
period is regressed against the percent change in GNP over these years, and the

results are shown in the second row of Table 5. Significant cyclicality is
evident, as more workers leave nonmanufacturing and move into manufacturing

when the economy expands, while fewer workers move into PMA jobs during an
expansion, being more content to stay in manufacturing or in nonmanufacturing.
Yet, while movements between sectors are cyclical, there is little

cyclicality in the number of people who remain in each sector over each two

year period. The bottom of Table 5 uses the two-year matched samples to look
at workers who stay in each sector for both years. On average, 30.2% of all
workers stay in PMA jobs, 17.6% stay in manufacturing, while 40% remain in non-

manufacturing. There is no cyclicality in these numbers. Although more people
leave nonmanufacturing to move into manufacturing during boom times, fewer of
them leave to move into PNA work, thus leaving about the same percentage of

tstayers in non-manufacturing. Examination of the other sectors reveals
similar offsetting patterns. The cyclical movements between sectors does not
change the percent remaining in a given sector.
Average wage changes over each two-year period for movers and stayers are

also shown in Table 5. There is clearly a great deal of variation in the wage
changes different individual experience as they move between sectors, as

evidenced by the large average standard deviations. However, there is no
20

evidence of cyclicality in these wage changes. In contrast, among the stayers
in a sector, while PMA workers show no cyclicality in their wage changes across
years, both manufacturing and non-manufacturing workers exhibit strong procyc-

licality in wages. Realize the implication of this result: individual
changes among workers who remain stably employed within the

wage

manufacturing and

nonmanufacturing sector show cyclical patterns. Since there can be no issue of
aggregation bias or compositional change among these workers, this is perhaps

the strongest possible evidence of real wage cyclicality over decade.

VI. SUMMARY
Aggregate wages are clearly cyclical during the 14 year period investigated

in this study. Little of this cyclicality at the aggregate level appears to be
related-to selective movements of workers in and out of the labor market; in
fact, there is no evidence here that any correlation between labor force
participation and wage levels occurs for white men, once education, age and

union status are accounted for. However, cyclicality in the determinants of
wages is apparent; there is procyclicality in both the constant (a homogeneous
shift in wages with business activity) and in the weighting on age, which means
that older and more experienced workers have a wage advantage in boom times.
However, these aggregate estimates assume a homogeneous labor market.

There is significant evidence that wages are separately determined for at least

three groups: professional, managerial and administrative workers, and all
other workers in manufacturing and in nonmanufacturing.

Significant movement

in the work force occurs between these sectors over the cycle. In particular,
more workers either move into or stay in manufacturing, or stay in nonmanufac-

turing. This shift is strongest among younger workers, so that the average age
of workers in manufacturing drops in boom times. However, there is no correlation between these sectoral movements and sector-specific wage levels, once a

standard set of worker characteristics are accounted for. Thus, micro-data
21

studies of wage changes should control for sector location, but can ignore
sector selectivity and still produce unbiased estimates of cyclical effects.
In addition to cyclicality in cross-sector movements among workers with
different skill characteristics, there is also cyclicality in wage determinants

within sectors over these years. Both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing
workers show homogeneous countercyclical changes in wage levels (countercyc-

licality in the constant.) This is offset by other procyclical effects.
Nanufacturing workers experience an increase in the coefficient on education

over the cycle. Nonmanufacturing workers receive more repayment for experience
in boom times, and less repayment to unionization.

PNA workers experience no

cyclicality in their aggregate wages, and this is reflected in a lack of
cyclicality in any of their wage coefficients.
unaffected by business cycles.

This group is thus largely

In short, both cyclical changes in the

constant as well as changes in the weighting on skill characteristics occurs
over the cycle, so that even workers who remain stably employed within a given
sector evince wage cyclicality if they are not in PMA jobs.
The results of this study raise a variety of issues which deserve further

investigation. First, given that aggregate wages prior to the 1970s showed
little cyclicality, it would be interesting to compare the labor market in the
l970s to an earlier time period and investigate what has changed. Second, the
nature and effect of individual job changes has been little studied in the

literature. More careful micro-data analysis of this issue would add to our
understanding of the sectoral labor market movements noted here. Third, while
this paper provides evidence that the wage determination process changes over
the cycle, a better understanding of how production and hiring processes
actually vary over the cycle, would be useful to provide some causal understanding of the empirical results reported here.

22

1. Earlier studies looked only at manufacturing wages. More recent work uses
aggregate wages from the entire labor market. In addition, wage definitions in
these newer studies often include overtime pay, second job income, and other
more cyclical components.
2.

There are more complex (and probably more realistic) ways of modeling the
relationship between wages and worker skills. See, for instance, Heckman and
Sedlacek [1985]. Unfortunately, the data we typically have available contains
only rather gross measures of worker skills, such as education level, age or
experience. It is certainly possible to view the standard wage-estimating
equation in (1) as a reduced form of a more complex relationship between worker
skills, job requirements and wages. In this case, the t's still provide a
translation of worker skills into wage levels, but a causal interpretation of
the process by which r is determined may be less clear.
3. In this example I assume that it is less skilled workers who leave the labor
market during recessions, but this is not clear a pori. More skilled workers
may have higher reservation wages, or a higher value of non-market time, and
thus may remain out of the labor market longer once unemployed.
4. This is a straightforward conclusion from the sample selectivity literature.
See Heckman [1974].
5. See Abowd and Card [l987J for empirical evidence on the extent of wage
smoothing.
6. The PSID follows everyone from the original sample and adds in all new
individuals who join the households of an existing sample member. Thus, the
size of the PSID is steadily increasing over time as new children and spouses
appear. Existing PSID individuals also enter my cross-sections as they age and
become household heads. The white male sample increases from 1657 to 2641
during these 14 years, and the black male sample increases from 694 to 1297.
7. As others have noted, this type of wage definition can be subject to serious
errors. It would be preferable to have actual reported wage rates, but this is
not available for all workers within the PSID. To the extent that errors in
the average hourly earnings series are not correlated with business activity,
this might create noise in my data, but should not bias my results.
8. If labor market participation is selectively chosen during the year, then
the coefficient on any annual measure of economic growth will be downward
biased. The preZerred alternative is a measure of growth derived only during
the period the worker is in the labor market. To the extent that I find
significant cyclical effects, they are minimum estimates of the true effect.
9. The small real annual change in wages reflects the overall stagnant macroeconomy during this time period. However, though real earnings grow very
little during these 14 years, there is significant cyclical activity. In 5 of
these years GNP growth is negative, in 5 years it exceeds 5%, and in the
remaining 4 years it varies between 2.6% and 3.4%.

10. I choose to proxy the business cycle with changes in GNP. This is the
variable which is used to officially define cyclical activity in the economy.
I have duplicated all results reported here using changes in unemployment rates
rather than changes in GNP. In no case do the results differ.
23

11. As noted above, this is at least partially due to the fact that I am using a
based on annual income and hours. Those
measure of average hourly earnings
excluded from the sample of workers in any given year must be non-labor market
participants over the entire year.
12. The wage equation estimated for each year uses ln(wage) as the dependent
variable, and includes education, age, age squared, a dummy variable for
unionization, and a constant.

13. I could regress individual wage changes against changes in GNP, rather than
using just the mean wage change. This would mean using only individuals who
are employed in two consecutive years; it would also involve an enormous number
of observations over the 14 yeas. This would produce the same estimates as
reported here since OLS fits through the means. The standard errors of the two
techniques will differ. Under reasonable assumptions, the standard errors
reported here are larger than those which would be produced if all the microdata were utilized jointly. Further problems in the standard errors arise from
the fact that the dependent variable itself is an estimate. While I could
adjust the variance/covariance matrix for the standard deviations in the
estimated 13's for each year, I have no idea how to calculate the covariance
between the estimates of 13 across the years. (The fact that the estimated
regression is in first difference form only increases these problems.) Not
adjusting for this should produce smaller standard errors than is accurate. A
priori I cannot tell which of these two effects would dominate. I have chosen
to report the uncorrected standard errors.
14. This technique is quite common in the empirical literature, thus I do not
repeat the econometric specification in great detail. In brief, the selectivity
term is calculated as
f(5Zt)/(1 - F(6Zt))
where 6 is the vector of coefficients estimated from a probit equation on labor
market participation. In my estimates, 6 includes education, age, age squared,
marital status and
number of dependents, and dummy variables indicating
residence in the northeast, northcentral or southern regions of the country.
15. Although the estimation procedures differ between the two papers, they both
should provide consistent estimates of wage cyclicality. Hoff itt, Keane and
Runkle follow the approach of other papers and measure cyclicality by including
a change in the unemployment rate in their individual wage change regressions.
16. Like equation (4), this too can be written in terms of the changes in the
13's and the changes in the X's. However, the mathematical expression is long
and not at all revealing.
17. Heckman and Sedlacek as well as Hoff itt, Keane and Runkle note differences
between the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sector. I experimented with a
variety of different sectoral breakdowns. While the manufacturing distinction
was important, it was also clear that white collar workers needed to be
differentiated from other workers.

are similar in their
18. One can reject the hypothesis that the three subgroups
wage equations at the 1% level of significance for both black and white workers
in each of the 14 years. (The mean coefficients over the 14 years look more
similar than the estimated coefficients in any given year.)
24

19. Of course, I would much prefer to use a variable which measured actual years
of work experience. The PSID provides this only after 1973. Since I need all
the time observations I can get, this leaves me with no choice but to use the
less accurate "age" variable in place of experience.
20. I report the results of this estimation only for white males for two
reasons: First, white men's wages show no evidence of being affected by labor
force participation movements, as noted above, so ignoring the participation
selectivity issue should not effect these results. (It would be very difficult
to estimate a model in which both labor market participation and choice between
three sectors occurs simultaneously.) Second, because of the small number of
black men in the PSID sample, estimating sectoral choices and separate wage
equations for each of the three sectors in a complex econometric model can be
difficult. This is particularly a problem for the PMA group of workers; in the
early years of the PSID, less than 50 black men are in this group.
21. For a more detailed presentation and an empirical example of the use of
this type of a three-way choice model, see Blank [1985].

APPENDIX

ESTIMATING A JOINT SECTOR SELECTION/WAGE MODEL
A worker is choosing one sector out of three (F, M, or N), each of which

have their own separate wage determination process. Let the utility available
in each sector to worker i be characterized by the equations

(Al) Up = Sap + Vp
UM

=

4- vt.

SaM

and UNSaN+VN
Choice of one sector over another is based on a utility comparison between the
sectors, which leads to the three equations ((12) -
