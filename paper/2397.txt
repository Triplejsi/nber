I. INTRODUCTION
A great deal of political discussion in recent years has focussed

on the extent to which economic growth helps relatively disadvantaged

groups in the United States. While some claim that the best thing we
can do for the poor is to make the economy grow, others contend that
economic growth passes by many low income groups and simply leaves them
worse off, relative to the rest of the society.
Previous research concerning the effect of the rnacroeconomy on the

income distribution has shown that both claims have some validity.

In

aggregate data, economic growth appears to have some narrowing effect on
the income distribution. 1

But there are specific demographic groups that

seem less responsive (elderly and female-headed households) or more
responsive (young and black male-headed households) to economic growth.

However, since these studies are based on aggregate income variables,

they make little attempt to investigate which components of income
respond most strongly to the economy and which are least affected.2

Using micro data, one branch of reseach has explored the
cyclicality of specific income components, such as male wage rates or

wives' labor force participation.3 While these studies provide a
detailed analysis of a particular economic variable, they are rarely
interested in comparing cyclical effects between income groups, or in

looking at how the cyclicality of a particular component affects the

cyclicality of aggregate income. More recently, a few studies have
utilized micro data to ask broader income distribution questions. This
research has investigated how changes in the macroeconomy induce changes
in employment and income among a variety of demographic groups.

-1-

This paper extends the approach taken in these latter studies,
using a national population sample which provides information on total

household income and all of its components. The data is analyzed by
income groups and by race, sex and age groupings, allowing me to study

the comparative cyclicality of the income components of each group to
economic growth.

The research is designed to provide a more

comprehensive picture of the channels by which economic growth produces

income change, providing comparative information on the relative
responsiveness of major income components both within and across
demographic groups.

In contrast to earlier research, this study

investigates a broader set of demographic groupings, looks at a more

disaggregate set of income components, and estimates the cyclical
effects of the macroeconomy in a way which imposes no pre-determined

structural model on the data.5 The results presented here are
interesting not just because they provide additional empirical evidence

on the effect of the business cycle on income distribution, but also
because they allow comparative statements to be made about the magnitude
of cyclical effects across a range of variables and populations.

This research indicates that aggregate income statistics hide very
significant differences in earning and income patterns between different

population groups. The major results are as follows:
(1)

This study confirms that the income distribution narrows in

times of economic growth. This occurs despite the fact that low income
groups have a very low share of labor market income compared to high

income quartiles. The narrowing occurs because the cyclicality of
household head's labor market income among low income groups is very

-2-

strong and overcomes the differential in shares.

In fact, the

procyclicality in head's labor market incomes is consistently stronger

than procyclicality in total income for almost all groups. Both wages
and hours show procyclical effects for household heads (a result that is

at least partially dependent upon the inclusive definition of labor
income which is used to calculate average hourly earnings.)
(2)

Women's earnings are remarkably non-responsive to

macroeconomic changes. Among wives, wages are procyclical, but their
hours show little change with the cycle, except among a few groups.
Female household heads show less cyclicality than any other group across

a range of their income components. Black women in particular show only
small responses to economic growth. A major conclusion of this study is

that women's labor market earnings in general move far less with the

general economy than do men's. Their initial elasticity response is
lower and it falls off rapidly as economic growth continues.

(3) Transfer income - -

public

and private --

is

counter-cyclical

for most middle income groups. Lower income groups show little change
in their transfers over the cycle. However cyclicality varies greatly

by the type of transfer. Unemployment and worker's compensation and
AFDC are very counter-cyclical.

(4) Not only do income differences between groups narrow when the
economy grows, but income dispersion (as measured by the coefficient of
va--iation) also narrows within almost all groups, primarily because the

dispersion of annual hours among household heads narrows. This implies
that the worst off among these groups catch up relative to the rest of
the population by taking advantage of greater employment opportunities.

-3-

Female and elderly heads and wives show less evidence of this withingroup income narrowing than do other population groups.
II.

DEFINING THE PROBLEM

Before describing the data or the methodology of this study in
more detail, this section defines the components of income and the
population groups which this research investigates.
For any household in any given year, total household income can be
expressed as

Inc = LIncH + LIncW +

(1)

Transfers

+

Othlnc,

where LIncH represents the labor income of the household head and can be
written as

LincH = AHE*Hours,

(2)

where ARE represents average hourly earnings and Hours represents annual
hours of work.6

Similarly, LIncW in equation 1 represents labor income of the wife
and can
(3)

be

written as

LIncW AHEWHoursW,

where AHEW and HoursW represent average hourly earnings and annual
hours of work of the wife.

Transfers in equation 1 represents total transfer income from all

sources. It can be further decomposed into
(4)

Transfers = AFDC + ChSup&A + SocSec +
tJ&WComp

+

OthRetlnc +

OthTrans,

where AFDC represents income from Aid to Families with Dependent
Children, the primary welfare program available to low income households

with children. ChSup&A represents child support or alimony from private

-4-

sources, while SocSec represents income from the Social Security
program. OthRetlnc stands for other retirement income, including all

pension funds or annuities exclusive of those received from Social
Security.

U&WComp represents income from Unemployment or Worker's

Compensation programs. OthTrans is all other transfer income, and
includes cash income from other welfare programs,7 help from relatives,
or other sources of transfer income.

Othlnc in equation 1 is the residual category for total income and

includes all income not contained elsewhere. This is asset income,
rents, dividends, and interest payments. The category also contains the
labor market earnings of any household member other than the head or the
wife.8 Equations (1) through (4) present the components of income and of
income change on which the rest of this paper will focus.

The above equations are written for an individual.

But as noted

earlier, our interest is in the behavior of particular groups of
individuals in the population. The twelve household groups which will
be investigated can be divided into three major categories:
Household
Income Groups
Poor

Household
Race/Sex Groups
Black Female Heads
White Female Heads
Black Male Heads
White Male Heads

Household
Groups
Elderly (Age>65) Heads
Young (Age<24) Heads
Middle (65 Age 24)
Heads

Bottom Quartile
Second Quartile
Third Quartile
Top Quartile
"Poor" is defined as all households whose total income is less than 125%

of a given "Income/Need Standard." This standard is very close to
(although not completely identical with) the official Census definition

of the poverty line.9 Note also that "Poor Households" need not be a

subset of "Bottom Quartile Households." Some large families may have

--

income levels that place them within the second quartile, but have need
levels large enough to place them in the Poor category as well.

Focussing on the components of income defined above for each of
the 12 population groups, I am interested in three primary questions:

(1) On average, how do these income components differ between
these populations? What is the mean level of each component or the mean
share of each component in total income?

(2) How do these components change as the economy grows? What is
the comparative elasticity of each income component to GNP growth within
each population?

(3) Are there changes in the variances of these income components

as GNP changes? Many people claim that income variances within groups
are likely to widen as the economy grows. This "bifurcation" hypothesis
claims that only some members of a group are able to take advantage of
economic growth. In particular, this story has frequently been told for
black men.

In contrast, others claim that economic growth allows those

who are behind to "catch up." The unemployed get jobs, and the
underemployed work more hours. This might imply that variances among
some groups will decrease during economic growth, as the "worse off"
have an opportunity to earn more income. The variance tests will allow
me to distinguish between these hypotheses.

III. DATA
The data used in this study are from the Panel Study of Income

Dynamics (PSID), collected by the Survey Research Center at the
University of Michigan.

I use the survey years 1970 to 1982, which

provide data on annual household income from 1969 to 1981.10 Using the

-6-

household tape, I extract all the variables necessary to calculate the
income components descr{bed in equations (1) through (4) (along with a
variety of demographic variables) for every household over the entire 13

years. Working with a data set of this size always raises numerous
empirical issues. Information on how problems of data inconsistency,
household splitoffs, and weighting were handled is available from the
author upon request.

The advantage of the PSID is that it provides a continuous history

on income changes within the same household, allowing one to calculate

how changes in aggregate economic growth translate into changes in
household income.

However, while there are clear advantages to

observing the same household over time, there is a major problem in
trying to follow households for several years. Only a small percentage
of households fall into the same income or demographic category for an
extended period. In particular, female-headed households are formed and

dissolve frequently; low income households move in and out of poverty
status; young household heads grow older; and so on. This paper is not

concerned with the long-term dynamics of income change for given
households. My concern is with the effect of changes in economic growth

on income components of households within each of these categories in
any year. As a result, rather than following the same households over
the entire time period, I select 12 "adjacent year" samples, each sample
cr'ntaining all those households whose head remains the same for a two-

year period. These range from a 1969/1970 sample to a 1980/1981 sample.

Obviously, the 1969/1970 sample looks a great deal like the 1970/1971
sample, and

includes

many of the same households. But it is not exactly

—7—

identical, as some changes in head do occur over these years.

(The

weighted samples look viitually identical, as they should.)

Thus I have 12 samples, each containing data on two consecutive
years for the same households.

I can separate each of these samples

into the 12 population groups defined above, where the household is
classified according to its total income in the first year of each two-

year period, or by the race, sex or age of its head. Then, for any twoyear period, for any population, I can calculate the means and variances

on all income variables for both years and the mean differences between

years. Putting together the data from all twelve samples provides a
12-year time series on mean changes in each income component among all

members of each population group. Thus, for every two-year period, for
every income component, and for every population group, I can derive
estimates of means, mean changes, shares, variances, and other variables

of interest.'' These variables can then be related to changes in the
general economic growth rate.12

IV. OBSERVING THE DATA
Before estimating the effect of business cycles, this section will

investigate the income patterns that exist between the 12 income, age,

and race/sex population groups. Equations (1) through (4) define a set
of income components that compose total income for any given household.

To calculate means of these income components for an entire population

it is necessary to distinguish between the mean level of an income
component available among those who receive it, and the mean number of

recipients of that component. Table 1 shows the components of total
income averaged over the entire 12 year period for all 12 population

-8-

groups in which I am interested. Shown are the mean (over the 12 years)
and the income share of each variable for each population group.'3 The

mean of each component is calculated only for those households who
report receiving positive income from that source. The percent in each
population group that receives income from each source is also shown.

Part A of Table 1 shows the mean of total income for each group
and the share breakdown into its four main components. Part B shows the

components of labor income calculated among those households which

receive labor income from the head. Part C shows the components of

wife's labor income calculated from among those households with a
working wife. Part D shows mean transfer income among those who receive

it, and the share of each of its components among recipients. Some
interesting patterns emerge.

First, looking at Part A, it is clear that labor income share

increases dramatically as income rises, from 41.1% in the bottom
quartile to 80.4% in the top quartile. This is due to an increase in
the level of both head's and wife's labor income across income quartiles

and an increase in the probability that the head and wife will work.

Low labor income shares among low income households are hardly
surprising. Among the poor, 54% of the households are female-headed (a
group with traditionally lower earnings and labor market participation),

while 57% report themselves as having some health problem that
interferes with work. Among the top quartile, only 4% of the households

are female-headed, and only 15% report such health problems. The
increase in the share of wife's labor income across income levels is due
to the increase in level of income earned by wives who work, an increase

in the percent of wives who work, and an increase in the percent of
heads who are married. (See the top of Part C.) Share of total income
from transfers decreases dramatically over the income scale, while the
share of "other income" increases.

Figure 1 shows how the mean incomes of these groups relate to each

other. Mean income for the entire population is $25,128. The quartile
breaks occur at $11,763, $21,332, and $32,859. While many people are
grouped near the mean, there is clearly a large and extended upper tail.
Like low income families in general, black and white female-headed

households receive a relatively low percentage of their income from the
labor market, as do the elderly. In contrast, black males and the young

rely heavily on the labor market. We would expect, a priori, that
growth in the economy would initially help those groups who are closely

tied to the labor market more than it helps others. As noted above,

previous research has indicated that female and elderly-headed
households are less responsive to economic changes.

Among the poor, the very low amount of labor market income
received might indicate that this group also is less affected by
economic growth.

The "trickling down" hypothesis does not look

promising when less than 36% of the income of the poor is directly tied

to the labor market. In order for the poor to gain relative to other
groups, the elasticity of labor income and labor market participation
with respect to GNP must be very strong for low income workers.

Part B shows the mean levels and standard deviations for the
components of head's labor income. This table indicates first that wage

differentials among groups are greater than hours differentials. For

-

10 -

instance, average hourly earnings among the top quartile are 3.4 times

greater than average hourly earnings among the bottom quartile. The
comparative figure for hours in these groups is 1.6.14 This is also true
between race and sex groups, where wage levels vary more than hours.

Part C shows mean levels and standard deviations for the
components of wife's labor income. Here are basically the same patterns

as were observed within head's labor income, but with smaller
differences between the groups. The relative wages of the wives in
wealthier households are higher than the wages of wives of the bottom
quartile, but the difference is less than is found among head's wages.

This at least partially reflects the fact that marital sorting along
economic lines is not perfect and the highest-earning husbands are not
always married to the highest-earning wives.

Wives of black males earn higher wages than black female heads,

but they work fewer hours. Wives of white heads earn about the same
wage as white female heads, but also work less. The elderly are the
only group for whom labor income of the wife is about equal to the labor

income of the head. But elderly wives earn a lower wage than their
husbands, making up the difference by working more hours.

Finally, Part D shows mean transfer levels between the groups and

the relative shares due to each of the six components of transfer
income. The patterns are consistent with the nature of these income

sources. AFDC is most important for low-income and female-headed
households.

Child support is most important for middle-income

households and women. Social Security is particularly important for the
elderly and low income. Other retirement income is most important among

— 11

-

higher-income households. Unemployment and worker's compensation is
most important to the middle income and young households.

I was rather surprised by the percent of households receiving some

form of transfer income. Among the poor, close to one quarter receive
no transfers--a number that I find surprisingly high.'5 Among the top
quartile, one fifth of households still receive transfer income, largely
in the form of non-welfare transfers such as other retirement income.

Table 1 shows the mean patterns among income components for these

groups. However, the focus of this paper is on changes in income. The

business cycle effects are those income changes related to the
macroeconomy that occur in addition to the secular income changes which

these populations typically experience. For the population as a whole
over these 12 years, real median income was effectively stagnant, so
there was no overall income trend.'6 (However, there are secular income

changes occuring within particular groups, relating to life cycle

changes as well as regression toward the mean. For data on these
effects, see the working paper version of this research, Blank (1985).)
V.

THE RESPONSIVENESS OF INCOME COMPONENTS TO THE CYCLE

This research requires that a general macroeconomic variable (GNP
growth) be related to specific microeconomic concepts, such as wage

rates or hours of work. The most obvious response --

to

enter GNP

- is

growth into micro-data regressions estimating wages or hours -

typically ineffective. The range of variation in individual responses
is almost always so great that aggregate variables rarely appear to be
significant. '7

- 12

-

This paper takes a different approach. The methodology outlined
below provides one way of combining a great deal of data on individual
households into more aggregate variables which are more readily compared

with GNP growth rates. Since my primary interest is in the comparative
responsiveness of different income sources to economic growth among the

12 populations, I will aggregate changes in income components within
individual households in each population group and regress these mean
changes for each population group against percent change in GNP across
the 12 time periods.18

I choose to use two measures of the relative responsiveness of

each income component to GNP. The first is the percent change in a

given component induced by a 1% change in GNP. The second is the
absolute or level change in a given component induced by a 1% change in
GNP.

These two measures provide complementary information on the

effects of the economic cycle.

The percent change in the level of income component X is
calculated over the entire population for each two year period. It

explicitly includes both the recipients of X, as well as the
nonrecipients in its calculation, thus allowing changes to occur both in

the number of recipients and in the level of X among recipients. Define
this total percent change for year t and population j as'9
(5)

PctCh(X). =!

-

(X..+1

X..)

/ Z

If I regress the percent change in variable X from each of the 12

two-year samples against a constant and the percent change in GNP over

these same years, the coefficient on GNP will provide an elasticity
estimate. This is the regression
(6)

PctCh(X).

=

l + a2PctGNPt + e.,
-

13

-

where

PctGNP = (GNP+i

-

GNPt)/GNPt

and e is a random error term. The coefficient z will indicate how
responsive income component X is to macroeconomic growth and can be
interpreted as the percent change in X due to a 1% increase in GNP.2°

However, this percent elasticity has certain limitations. While

it is useful in comparing the responsiveness of different income
components both between and within population groups, it can appear
misleading. When percent changes are calculated off numbers with large

base levels, even small percent changes can imply large absolute
changes, and vice versa. Since the different income components vary
widely in their level values, I present not only the percent change but
also the level change associated with changes in GNP.
The level change for income component X for population j in year t
is the numerator of the percent change calculation in equation (5):
(7)

LevCh(X).

Z (X..+i -

X..t)

/

This measure can also be regressed against the percent change in GNP,
(8)

LevCh(X). =

+ 2PctGNP +

where PctGNP is defined above and u is a random error term. The
coefficient

will measure the mean dollar change in income component X

(among all households in population j) resulting from a 1% change in
GNP.

and

Table 2 presents estimates of

(Constants are included

in all regressions, but not reported here.) Panels A-i through D-l
indicate the percent change elasticities of all income components to GNP

growth, while panels A-2 through D-2 present the level change
elasticities. Part A reports the results for the components of total

-

14

-

income, Part B shows the results for the components of head's labor

income, Part C shows th elasticities for components of wive's labor
income, and Part D shows elasticities for components of transfers.

Part A indicates how the aggregate components of income vary with

GNP and reveals some striking patterns. First, total income among low
income groups shows far greater percent increases than among high income
groups.

These results confirm that increases in GNP growth

proportionately narrow the income distribution. However, the large
percent changes in panel A-i must be offset by looking at the level
elasticities in panel A-2. Perhaps not surprisingly, absolute dollar
changes are much larger among upper income groups. A 1% increase in

GNP, leading to a 1.6% increase in income for the average poor
household, means an extra $109 to spend over the year. The top quintile
household, whose income increases only .85%, gets an additional $433 to
spend.

Second, there are some groups whose income is quite unresponsive
to GNP changes. In particular, female-headed households and the elderly
have very low elasticities and gain little from economic growth. On the

other hand, black male households and the young have very high
elasticities. This meshes with the results cited above from research
using more aggregate data sources.
Third, the driving force behind these elasticity patterns in total

income is the elasticity of head's labor income. Percent changes are
consistently larger for head's labor income than for total income. The

only exception is among black female-headed households. Clearly, the
smaller share of total income due to labor earnings among low income

households (seen in Table 1) is offset by the very high relative
elasticities on head's earnings, leading to a net narrowing effect in
the income distribution as the economy grows.

Fourth, wife's labor income seems quite unresponsive to
macroeconomic change. Almost all groups show small procyclical, but
insignificant, effects. Only the wives of black men and young men have
labor market income that appears to increase proportionately with the

economy. The wives of elderly men actually show a relatively large
countercyclical effect.

Finally, transfer income shows mixed effects. Among the poorest

groups transfers appear relatively unresponsive to GNP growth. Among
more middle income groups, including male-headed households and young
and middle-aged households, transfer income is strongly countercyclical.

Part B looks at the cyclicality of the components of head's labor

income. Notice that the large percent changes in head's labor income
among low income groups is due to higher elasticities of both hourly
earnings and hours of work (although the changes in hours are estimated
with greater precision.)21 Among the poor a 1% increase in GNP increases

wages 2.57%, or 6 cents an hour, and increases annual hours of work by

1.25% or 9 hours. Both of these effects decrease as income rises.
Female-headed households - -

black

and white - -

have

the lowest

elasticity of earnings.

These results are somewhat in contrast to theories of fixed
wage/variable employment contracts which are often used to describe the
labor market, and with macroeconomic studies indicating that aggregate

real wages are largely unaffected by cyclical change.22 However, the

-

16

-

finding that both wages and hours move over the cycle is consistent with

recent research by Bus (1984), Coleman (1984) and Raisain (1983).23 One
particular reason for significant wage cyclicality in this research is

that I use a measure of wages which includes all labor market income
(including overtime and second jobs) and imbeds movement in and out of
the labor market.24

Part C shows the components of wife's labor income and the
patterns here are very different from head's earnings. Some wives
appear to gain income over the cycle through large procyclical wage
effects. Average hourly earnings of wives show strong percent increases
among wives of low income and young heads, though these effects drop off

rapidly at higher income levels.

However, this translates into

relatively small changes in wages,25 so that the level change in wages

is approximately the same for women across all income categories. This
further underscores the finding that women seem to be in jobs which are
unresponsive to cyclical effects, protecting them against downturns, but
also preventing them from gaining during upturns.

Cyclical effects on wives' annual hours are generally small. Past
research has attempted to determine whether discouraged or added worker
effects dominate labor supply behavior among married women.26 In Table

2, these two effects appear to cancel each other out, with two
exceptions. Wives in poor households appear to be added workers (a 1%

increase in GNP leads to a 1.02% decrease in hours worked.) Wives of
young heads seem to have an opposite response, increasing participation

as the economy expands. However, none of these effects are welldetermined.

- 17 -

Finally, Part D shows cyclical elasticities for the components of
transfer income. Receipt of transfers is mildly countercyclical for low

income groups and strongly countercyclical for richer groups. AFDC is
negatively correlated with the cycle, while child support and alimony,
along with other retirement income and social security, are procyclical.

(This is partly due to legislative changes, which coincided with

business cycle effects.) Unemployment compensation is strongly
negatively correlated with GNP growth, particularly among young and

white male households. For the elderly, who rely heavily on social
security income, there is little correlation between this income source

and the business cycle, although other retirement income is strongly
procyclical for them. Black female-headed households seem to experience

more counter-cyclicality in transfers than white female-headed
households, although both rely heavily on a very similar mix of
transfers. The young, black male-headed households, and the upper
quartiles appear to face the greatest cyclicality in their transfer
components.

In absolute levels, the largest changes occur in

unemployment and worker's compensation and

in

social security for most

groups.

The regression results reported in Table 2 are quite simple in
their form, containing just a constant and the percent change in GNP. A

few more complex specifications were tried. A test of the symmetry of
cyclical effects was run, separating the elasticity effects in the years

in which GNP increased from the years in which it decreased. For no
variable or population group did this produce a significantly different

result from those reported here. Similarly, decomposing GNP into a

-

18

-

trend and a cyclical component and entering each variable separately in

these regressions producd little new information.
More informative was the addition of a nonlinear term, the square

of the percent change in GNP. This was insignificant for all except
female workers. For female household heads and for the wives of elderly

and poor households, the nonlinear term had a significant negative
effect on labor market income, primarily via significant negative
effects on hours of work. This appears to indicate that these women,

while gaining from the initial stages of a cyclical upturn, do not
continue those gains at higher growth levels. Their ability to profit

from continued economic growth falls off rapidly. These results are

consistent with a theory that female heads and wives often have
significant non-market claims on their time (such as children) that

prevent them from making large hours increases when employment
opportunities expand.

The estimates in Table 2 combine the effects of cyclical changes
in labor market participation with cyclical changes in levels of work

Elasticities on labor market

among already-working participants.

participation can be calculated separately.27 Changes over the cycle in

the percent of households with working heads or wives are generally
small and not highly significant. Approximately 1/2 of 1 percent of the
poor households and black female-headed households gain a working head

when the economy grows 1%. The effects for other groups are smaller.
Among wives, there is a tendency for wives of low income groups to be
added workers while wives of high income groups are discouraged workers
(a finding consistent with other research cited above), but the effects

- 19

-

are small and largely insignificant. These results indicate that the
elasticity estimates for hours of work presented in Table 2 are largely

the result of changes in the levels of hours and wages among workers,
and not movement in and out of the labor force.

VI. VARIANCE ELASTICITIES
The results in Table 2 indicate that the distribution of income

between these 12 populations narrows over the cycle. This section
investigates whether there are distributional changes within each

population group, by looking at the change in the coefficient of
variation of these income components as GNP changes. As noted above,
there are reasons to believe that variance in some groups will increase

with growth (a bifurcation among groups), and other arguments that
indicate variances will decrease (the bottom catches up.) I use the

coefficient of variation (CVar(X). for each income component X) to
measure this effect since it is invariant to changes in the mean.28

Elasticities are calculated by regressing percent change in the
coefficient of variation of each income component against percent change

in GNP (and a constant.) The percent change in the coefficient of
variation is calculated within each two year sample as,
(9)

CVarCh(X). = [CVar(X).+1

-

CVar(X).t]

I

CVar(X)..

The percent change in the coefficient of variation of X as GNP changes
is determined in the regression equation
(10)

CVarCh(X). =

+ 2Pct + v,

where PctGNP is defined above and v is a random error term. Table 3
presents estimates of 2' showing the percent change in coefficient of
variation resulting from a 1% change in GNP for each income component.

-

20

-

The dominant conclusion from Part A of Table 3 is that short term
cyclical growth not only narrows the income distribution between these
population groups, but also narrows the income dispersion within these
groups.

Among almost all groups a significant decrease in the

coefficient of variation of total income occurs as the economy grows.

Black females alone show a small and insignificant change.

(White

females also show a relatively small change, although it is
significant.) The poor show a larger, but poorly estimated effect.

The channel by which this narrowing occurs is also clear. The
dispersion in labor market income of the head narrows significantly with

the cycle for all groups except elderly and black female heads. Wive's

labor market income shows few effects --

only

among wives in upper

income groups and among wives of white males and middle-aged is there
significant narrowing. (These results are consistent with the results
above which indicated that wives in low-income households and female

heads benefit less from the cycle. The worst off among these groups
seem unable to take advantage of economic growth to "catch up" and
narrow the income distribution within the group.)

If we look at Parts B and C in Table 3 it is further clear that

the narrowing in the coefficient of variation that occurs in labor
market income seems to be occuring almost exclusively through changes in

the distribution of annual hours. While the relative narrowing between
groups occured because of greater cyclicality in both wages and hours

among low-income groups, the narrowing dispersion of income within
groups appears predominantly due to unemployed or underemployed heads
working more hours.

ELASTICITIES FOR THE COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION OF INCOME COMPONENTS

Table 3

Elasticities of the coefficient of variation among components of

transfer income are not reported here, largely because virtually no
significant effects appear and few patterns are visible.

Thus among most groups I find evidence of a narrowing distribution

in their labor market income as the economy grows, occuring due to
narrowing in the distribution on annual hours. The groups for whom this

effect is weakest are female heads and elderly households.
Distributional patterns both between and within population groups change
with macroeconomic cycles.

VII. CONCLUDING COMMENTS
This study has decomposed total income among population groups
into its various components and then studied the manner in which these

components change with economic growth. The major conclusions were
presented in the first section of this paper.

In general, I find

significant differences in elasticities both between different income
components and between different population groups for the same

components. The narrowing income distribution in times of high growth
occurs primarily because of large elasticities on head's labor market

income among the poor. Both wages and hours show evidence of
cyclicality. The labor market earnings of women -- both wives and
household heads -- are far less responsive to growth. Cyclicality in
transfer income varies enormously between population groups and by type
of transfer.

While this research uncovers a number of interesting patterns, it

also raises a host of additional questions. Further exploration is
needed of the causality behind many of the effects seen here.

-

22

-

In

particular, it

would be interesting to focus more on the consistent non-

responsiveness of women's labor market income (both female head's and

wife's) to the cycle. Also a closer investigation needs to be done of
the comparative wage and hours cyclicality found here.

In addition,

further analysis of some of the cyclical effects among the components of
transfer income would be of interest.

Finally, this study says nothing about the effects of changes in

long-term secular growth rates within the macroeconomy. Over the time

period of this study, no secular growth is apparent.

However, the

response of different groups in the population to short-term economic
growth may be expected to have some correlation with their response to
long-term growth. If so, it is clear that higher long-term growth rates

for the U.S. economy would narrow the income distribution and help a
significant number of currently low-income households. (An effect often

referred to as "trickling down.") However, it is also true that these
benefits would not be equally spread among the low income population.
Especially among female household heads -- a group that has received a

great deal of attention due to their high poverty rates -- economic
growth alone is far from a panacea or solution.

5.

Rayack looks at a very limited population, investigating only twoparent households which are stably married and where the husband is

in the labor market for each of the 13 years in the study,
excluding many low-income households. Gramlich and Laren look at
three household groupings: female-headed, black and white maleheaded. They exclude households which are together less than 5
years, or whose prime earner is out of the labor market much of the
time.

Their focus is on cyclicality in total income and

employment.
6.

Of course, I could further decompose Hours into Hours per Week and
Weeks per Year. This is not done because the data available on
these two variables in my data set (the PSID) is more suspect than
the data on AHE and Hours. For many individuals, it is missing.

7.

The largest welfare program in the "other" category is
Supplementary Security Income (SSI). SSI is created at the Federal
level in the middle of my data. Prior to its emergence many
households received transfers from a variety of state-run programs,
which cannot be separately identified. It was easiest to leave all
of this in the "other transfers" category. Compared to Social
Security and AFDC, SSI is a far less significant program.

8.

While it would be interesting to separate out these other labor
market earnings, there is a limit to the number of variables easily
examined in one paper. Earnings of the head and spouse represent
over 96% of average household labor market income.

9.

For a full explanation of the difference, see The User Guide to the
PSID (1984). The 125% number is selected because my data set (the
PSID, discussed more fully below) consistently finds more household

income than the Census. This is the accepted way of defining a
poverty standard for this data that identifies approximately the
same population as the standard Census definition of poverty. For
instance, this definition is used by Bane and Eliwood (1986) in
their PSID-based study of the dynamics of poverty.
10.

Like all self-reported surveys, the PSID is subject to
underreporting of both transfer income and asset income.
Therefore, compared to the National Income Accounts, it shows less
income from these two categories. (There are also definitional
problems in comparing NIA data to PSID data.) However, the PSID
- 24 -

does appear more accurate (at least in its information on
transfers) than the Current Population Survey. The trends in
income components from the PSID match closely with those reported
elsewhere.
11.

Realize that this data set is somewhat different from many others.
Typically, one either has extensive cross-sectional data for one
year only (such as a CPS survey) or one has aggregate mean data

from different random samples taken each year (such as annual
wages or unemployment rates.) In contrast, my data set allows one
to estimate changes between years among the same households. But
successive changes come from different cross sections, weighted to
appear as identical random samples of the population.
12.

13.

This study makes no attempt to separately identify permanent and
transitory income effects.
For instance, households could
potentially be grouped by income according to their permanent,
rather their current, income.
This is not done for two reasons.
First, I am interested in knowing the effect of cyclical changes
on the apparent income distribution. Among those whose income
grows when the macro economy improves there will be some who are
experiencing long-term income growth and others who are simply
recovering from a short-term income fluctuation.
It is left to
future research to separately estimate the extent of these two
effects. Second and more practically, there are serious empirical
problems in satisfactorially estimating permanent income levels
for households that change headship and composition frequently.
The groups in which I am most interested - - low income or femaleheaded -- are precisely those for whom this problem is most acute.

In population group j at time t the mean level of any income

14.

One way of interpreting these numbers is that the labor supply
functions governing behavior of workers at different income levels
are different. Low income household heads supply more hours of
work at their mean wage rates than do higher income households.

15.

Underreporting of transfer income may affect these numbers.

16.

Median family income (in 1981 dollars) in 1969 was $23,482. In
1981 it was almost unchanged at $23,282.
Per capita disposable
income and per capita consumption expenditures increase over this
period. The discrepancy appears primarily due first, to the
splintering of households, with single person and single parent
households growing faster than the total population; and second,
to the use of the CPI to deflate median income. (The CPI has
increased faster than the deflators which are used in the National
Income Accounts.)

17.

For instance, many researchers regularly attempt to enter state or

even county unemployment rates into micro-data labor force
Although one might believe that
participation estimates.
unemployment rates should affect household labor force decisions,
the coefficients on these aggregate unemployment rates rarely
appear different from zero.
18.

Of course, GNP is not the only possible measure of cyclicality.
In particular, some studies have used changes in unemployment
I choose to use GNP for two reasons. First, most of the
rates.
"trickle down" theories explicitly refer to macroeconomic growth
as the primary channel by which the income distribution is
affected. GNP growth is the most frequently used measure of this.
Second, the unemployment rate over these 12 years experienced a
significant amount of change due to shifting demographic patterns,
producing a steady increase in the average underlying rate of
unemployment between 1969 and 1981. This means that unemployment
changes imbed both demographic and cyclical effects, making them a
less attractive measure of cyclical change.

19.

Rather than the percent change of the means, I could calculate the

However, this would create
mean of the percent changes.
difficulties as nonrecipients in year t would have zeros in the
denominator.
20.

Rather than use mean income components for each population group
as my dependent variables, I could regress individual household
observations against aggregate GNP changes. Rather than 12
observations, I would then have many thousands. However, this
alternative is costly to implement and both estimating techniques
should produce identical coefficients since OLS fits a line
through the means. The standard errors will vary, and it is
impossible to say a priori which set of standard errors will be
lower. Under reasonable assumptions one could expect that the
standard errors on my estimates will be larger, implying that my
-

26

-

significance levels may be understated relative to a fully
efficient estimator.
21.

The extent to which the change in hours is due to an increase in
labor force participation is discussed below.

22.

For instance, Altonji and Ashenfelter (1980) find that wages
appear to follow a random walk. Geary and Kennan (1982) reach
similar conclusions.

23.

Coleman indicates that wage cyclicality is a phenomenon of the
1970s; studies using earlier data found few cyclical effects.

24.

The wage measure used here is the ratio of all labor market income
over annual hours of work. Explicit wage rates are not available
for the entire sample during the 12 years which I am analyzing.

23.

Recall that the level elasticity is the expected level change due
to a l0 increase in GNP calculated over the entire population.
Since many wives do not work, these expected level changes are

quite small. This also means the base of the percent change
calculation is small, so small absolute changes in levels can
produce large percent changes.
26.

The classical work on the cyclicality of wife's income is Mincer
(1962), who finds almost no cyclical effects. On the other hand,
quite a few cross-sectional studies have found strong negative
relationships between wife's participation and husband's earnings.
Most recently, see Ransom (1982) and Lundberg (1985). My results,
showing large added worker effects only among poor wives, is
consistent with this other research.

27.

See the working paper, Blank (1985), for a more complete
presentation of these results.

28.

As noted above, there are consistent changes in the mean of some
of these income components for certain populations over a two-year

period.
(For instance, among the young, income grows.)
general, the coefficient of variation measures the dispersion of
the variable in each year, adjusting for these mean changes. The
