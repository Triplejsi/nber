Parental Monitoring and Children's Internet Use: The Role of Information, Control, and Cues
Francisco Gallego, Ofer Malamud, and Cristian Pop-Eleches
NBER Working Paper No. 23982
October 2017, Revised August 2018
JEL No. D82,I15,J12,J13
ABSTRACT
This paper explores how parental information and control can influence children’s internet use in
Chile. We designed and implemented a set of randomized interventions whereby approximately
7700 parents were sent weekly SMSs messages with (i) specific information about their
children’s internet use, and/or (ii) encouragement and assistance with the installation of parental
control software. We separate the informational content from the cue associated with SMS
messages and vary the strength of the cues by randomly assigning whether parents received
messages in a predictable or unpredictable fashion. Our analysis yields three main findings. First,
we find that messages providing parents with specific information affects parental behavior and
reduces children’s internet use by 6-10 percent. Second, we do not find significant impacts from
helping parents directly control their children’s internet access with parental control software.
Third, the strength of the cue associated with receiving a message has a significant impact on
internet use.

1. Introduction
Economists have long been interested in how parents can influence their children’s
actions.1 However, in many situations, parents are unable to monitor their children
because they lack information and cannot observe their children’s actions.2 Even with
perfect information, parents may not be able to affect their children’s actions if they are
unwilling to make negative transfers that impose large costs on the child (Weinberg,
2001; Berry, 2015). As a result, parents may wish for the possibility of controlling their
children’s actions directly. The first motivation of this paper is to explore the effect of
providing parents with additional information and direct controls in the context of
home computers and internet use. To this end, we designed and implemented a set of
randomized interventions whereby we sent parents weekly SMS messages containing
specific information about their children’s recent internet use and/or encouragement
and assistance with installing parental control software.3
The impact of providing parents with additional information or tools to directly
control their children’s actions may also depend on the cues associated with SMS
messages.4 Thus, a second motivation of this paper is to better understand the role of
cues in messages more generally. To this end, we also designed our interventions to
separate the informational content from the cue associated with the SMS messages. In
addition, we attempted to vary the strength or salience of the cues by randomly
assigning whether parents received messages in a predictable or unpredictable fashion.

For example, Becker (1974, 1981) introduced the “Rotten Kid Theorem” to show that, under certain
assumptions, parents can determine their children’s actions indirectly through ex-post transfers.
2 Relatedly, Bergstrom (1989) shows the Rotten Kid theorem does not hold in the presence of asymmetric
information. Bursztyn and Coffman (2012) provide evidence for such asymmetric information in Brazil.
3 A number of recent papers study the effect of sending SMS messages to parents with information from
schools (Bergman, 2016; Bergman and Chan, 2017; Berlinski et al., 2017; Cunha, et al. 2017). Castleman
and Page (2017) text parents about preparing their children for enrollment in college. Dizon-Ross (2018)
and de Walque and Valente (2018) examine the in-person provision of information to parents.
4 Taubinsky (2014) considers cues in a model of inattentive choice. Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Schleifer
(2017) present a theory in which cues that surprise relative to previous norms affect choice.

This is inspired by research in neuroscience suggesting that human responses may be
related to the predictability or novelty of the stimuli (Parkin, 1997; Berns et al., 2001;
Fenker et al., 2008). It is also closely related to research in psychology on how different
schedules of reinforcement affect behavior (Ferster and Skinner, 1957).
Exploring the role of parents when navigating home technology is instructive
because the informational frictions are likely to be pronounced and implementing direct
controls can be difficult; children are often quicker to adapt to new technologies and
parents may encounter challenges in understanding how children use technology.
Previous research has shown that access to home computers and internet have negative
or null effects on academic achievement (Malamud and Pop-Eleches, 2011; Fairlie and
Robinson, 2013; Beuermann, et al. 2015; Malamud et al. 2018; Vigdor, Ladd, and
Martinez 2014). A recent study that exploits exogenous variation of internet
penetration in Chile finds negative impacts of internet use on standardized test scores,
especially for low-income families (Gonzalez, 2017). Given that computers represent
such a versatile technology, the potential risks and benefits of computer use are likely to
depend on parental involvement. Indeed, Malamud and Pop-Eleches (2011) found that
parental rules for homework and computer use attenuated the negative effects of
computer ownership, suggesting that parental supervision may be an important
mediating factor.
We focus on a sample of children in 7th and 8th grade who received free
computers and 12 months of free internet through Chile’s “Yo Elijo mi PC” (YEMPC)
program in 2013. We have data on the intensity of internet use at the daily level from
the internet service provider (ISP) which served all of the computers provided to the
children in our sample. According to this data, children used approximately 174MB of
internet content daily, which translates to about 3 hours of internet use per day. This is
3

similar to recent estimates from a 2015 PISA survey showing that children in Chile
spent 195-230 minutes online per day, the highest rate among all the OECD countries
surveyed (OECD, 2017). To put this in context, the American Academy of Pediatrics
(AAP) recommends no more than 2 hours of screen time for children (AAP, 2016).
Furthermore, over 75 percent of the parents in our baseline survey expressed the view
that their children used too much internet or the wish to better control their children’s
internet use.
Our unique data enabled us to introduce a treatment that provided parents with
information about their children’s internet use. For this “ISP information” treatment, we
sent parents weekly SMS messages providing specific information from the ISP about
the intensity of internet use, in terms of MBs uploaded/downloaded, over the previous
week. For the “parental control” treatment, we sent parents weekly SMSs offering
assistance with the installation of Windows 8 (W8) parental control software. We also
incorporated a treatment arm that included both ISP information and assistance with
W8 parental controls to test for possible interactions between these treatments.
To disentangle the informational content and the offer of assistance from the cue
associated with SMS messages, we compare these treatments to a control group in
which parents received generic SMSs reminding them that children should make good
use of their computers, a message that was included in every treatment. Furthermore,
we attempted to vary the strength or salience of the cue within each of our treatment
arms by randomly assigning parents to either receive the SMSs on the same day of the
week (the “fixed” subgroups) or a on random day of the week (the “random”
subgroups). All of these interventions lasted for 14 weeks.
We have three main sets of results. First, we find that households in which
parents received ISP information about internet use had 6 to 10 percent lower intensity
4

of internet use during the treatment period relative to households in the control group.
These effects persist in the weeks and months after treatment ended. They do not
reflect declines in parents’ own internet use. This suggests that our temporary
intervention providing information on internet use may have altered the permanent
intra-household equilibrium. Indeed, some parents who received information reported
that they were more likely to punish their children and some reported having calm
discussions with their children about internet use. There is even some evidence that
parenting styles become less permissive. Furthermore, we find that our informational
interventions may substitute for the presence of a parent at home but are
complementary to parents’ capacity to be involved in their children’s lives.
We also show that there are statistically significant reductions of internet use
precisely on the days immediately after receiving the ISP information, and that this
effect is more relevant in the early weeks of the experiment. The decline in internet use
is largest for parents who didn’t think their children used too much internet at baseline
but whose children had high levels of internet use. Similarly, we find stronger impacts
of providing ISP information in the upper quintiles of the distribution of internet use.
Moreover, it is those SMS messages conveying that children used more internet than the
reference group in a specific week, which produce a much larger decline in internet use.
These findings confirm that it is specific information provided to parents about their
children’s internet use that leads to significant reductions of internet use.
Second, we do not find significant impacts from helping parents directly control
their children’s internet access. In particular, we do not find a difference in internet use
between parents who were encouraged and provided assistance to install parental
control software as compared with those in the control group who only received a
generic message. Take-up of this intervention was only 15 percent when measured in
5

terms of parents who actually responded to our messages. However, for those taking up
the intervention, we do not find changes in internet use even on the days immediately
after installing the parental control settings. We believe these findings reflect the
considerable obstacles faced by low-income parents in implementing technological
solutions for monitoring and supervising their children.
Third, we have several results that help us open the “black box” of how messages
that contain information can affect behavior. As mentioned above, by sending messages
that vary the amount of information, we show that a message’s informational content
reduces internet use. Our analysis also yields two additional findings that suggest the
importance of cues. When we experimentally varied the strength or salience of the cue,
we find that households who received SMSs on a random schedule experienced
significantly greater reductions in internet use than those on fixed schedules, an effect
similar in magnitude to the main effect associated with receiving the ISP information.
Furthermore, we find that even the SMS messages sent to the control group had shortterm impacts on internet use in the first weeks of the experiment, perhaps due to the
novelty of the message.
Our paper makes several contributions: First, we identify real-time impacts of
the provision of information on internet use, an important dimension of children’s
behavior at home that is often imperfectly observed to parents. Second, we use
experimental variation to isolate the causal effect of providing parents with specific
information and helping parents exercise direct control over their children’s behavior.
Third, we isolate the impact of providing parents with specific information from the
effect of a cue associated with receiving a message. Such cues are likely to be an
important part of any attempt to provide parents (or other economic actors) with
information. Fourth, we further explore the role of these cues by introducing
6

experimental variation in when parents received SMS messages. Thus, this study
provides a unique opportunity to explore factors that affect parental monitoring and to
better understand how and why messages containing information affect behavior.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides some background on the
Yo Elijo mi PC program and the experimental design. Section 3 describes the data, the
empirical strategy, and examines take-up. Section 4 presents the main findings. Section
5 explores the important role of parents. Section 6 presents further results. Finally,
Section 7 concludes.

2. Background
2.1 The Yo Elijo mi PC (YEMPC) program
We designed and implemented our experiment for the 2013 cohort of the YEMPC
program. YEMPC is a Chilean government program that provides computers to 7th
graders with high academic achievement from disadvantaged households. Students are
eligible for the program if they have attained a sufficiently high grade point average
(GPA) in 4th, 5th, and the first semester of 6th grade and if their household scored below
a certain level on a measure of poverty used to determine eligibility for social programs
called the Ficha de Protección Social (FPS).
The timeline of YEMPC for each round is as follows: Eligible students are
identified based on their FPS and GPA scores in September-October of the year prior to
receipt of the computer. Every student who meets the FPS and GPA requirements is
eligible to receive a computer; there is no application process. Students select a
computer in November-December. A number of options are available each year,
although all computers were equipped with Windows 8 and Microsoft Office.
Computers are distributed to students during the months of April and May. The
7

computers are given in schools, at a ceremony organized by the municipality in which
the student is enrolled. Beginning with the 2011 cohort, students with some types of
computers also received 12 months of free internet service through a private Internet
Service Provider (ISP).
Our experiment centers on students who entered 7th grade in 2013 and were
selected to the program in November 2012. Figure 1 presents the timeline associated
with the 2013 cohort of the YEMPC. We focus on the 32,270 beneficiaries of this cohort
who received free internet access with their computers starting in mid-2013 (out of a
total of 52,122 beneficiaries). We called parents by phone using contact information
from the program’s administrative records, asking them to participate in the study and
complete a telephone baseline survey. Our final analysis sample consists of 7,707
parents with a valid cell phone (which we require to implement our SMS interventions)
and who consented to participate in the experiment.5
Prior to receiving computers through the YEMPC program, 40% of beneficiaries
had a PC at home, 23% had internet access at home, and 6% had a cell phone with internet
access.6 Furthermore, the median student reported only having "access to internet some
times in the week". This contrasts with an average of three hours of internet use per day
at the baseline of our experiment. Did the increase in internet use benefit children? As
mentioned earlier, previous research on the effect of internet use in Chile and in the
United States indicates negative effects on academic achievement. Moreover, based on
data from our baseline survey, over 75 percent of the parents expressed the view that
their children used too much internet or the wish to better control their children’s

Appendix Table 1 compares the students in our analysis sample with a broader sample of those who
received a computer with free internet through the “Yo Elijo Mi PC” program. We do not observe large
differences between the analysis sample and the broader sample.

internet use. That said, even if internet use is not detrimental for children’s outcomes, the
findings in our paper are still important for understanding how information and cues
affect behavior.

2.2 Experimental Design
The intervention consists of delivering weekly text messages to the 7,707 parents in our
experimental sample. The SMSs differed in terms of content and the day of the week in
which they were delivered. In terms of content, we had three types of SMSs based on the
following scripts:


SMS-only: “We hope your child makes good use of the Yo Elijo Mi PC laptop that
he/she won”.



ISP: “We hope your child makes good use of the Yo Elijo Mi PC laptop that he/she
won. Your child downloaded XX MBs the week of the DD-MMM, {“more than", or
“similar to", or “less than"} what a typical child downloaded: YY MBs.” 7



W8: “We hope your child makes good use of the Yo Elijo Mi PC laptop that he/she
won. The Parental Control program of Windows 8 can help you supervise your
child's computer use. Call us at XXX-XXXX for assistance.”

Group T0 received the SMS-only message, group T1 received the ISP message, group T2
received the W8 message, and group T3 received both the ISP and W8 messages (in that
order). For each group, half of the families received the treatments on a fixed day of the
week (and we randomized the day on which they received the message) and half of the
families received the messages on random days of each week. Table 1 shows how the
7,707 families were divided into the different experimental groups.

We calculate weekly MBs downloaded by a “typical child” using a separate reference group of 1,929
children who received free internet through the YEMPC program.
7

We used information from a baseline survey and administrative data on internet
use to implement a stratified randomization with the following strata: (i) guardian's
education (No High-School, High School, College), (ii) parent perception of whether the
student stays too long in front of the computer (Yes or No), and (iii) total MBs
downloaded in the pre-treatment period between September and December 15, 2013.
The messages were sent weekly between 4pm and 5pm on different days of the week
between December 23, 2013 and April 6, 2014. This period covers the summer vacation
(from December, 23 2013 to March 6, 2014) and the school period (from March 7,
2014).

3. Empirical Framework
3.1 Data
The main source of data for our study is administrative data on internet use for each
beneficiary collected by the ISP provider. This includes daily information on MBs
downloaded and uploaded. We received this information for each beneficiary from
September 22, 2014 to June, 17, 2015. Thus, we have information on internet use for the
period before the SMS treatments started, for the period in which the SMSs were
delivered, and for 12 weeks after the treatment was discontinued. In addition, we used
information from the baseline survey to conduct the stratified randomization and to
control for several baseline characteristics in our main specifications. These include
student gender, guardian age, family composition, number of siblings, parents’
education, parents’ working conditions, and guardian´s perceptions of internet and
computer use. We have information for all the individuals included in the sample, as
this was part of the enrollment process.

10

Table 2 summarizes student and parental characteristics for our main
experimental sample. The daily mean MBs used in the 3 months of the pre-treatment
period was approximately 174 MB which corresponds to 186 minutes of predicted
internet use. Almost all of the children in our sample live with their mothers, and over
sixty percent also live with their fathers. Moreover, about three-quarters have a sibling
living with them while fifteen percent also live with a grandparent. Our sample of
students is 43 percent female and have an average of 1.7 siblings. The average age of the
guardian is 40 years old. Most guardians have some secondary education, with just 4
percent having some higher education, and the remainder with elementary education,
which is not surprising given the target population of the YEMPC program.
During the treatment period, we were able to gather information about whether
the SMSs sent were received on the cell phones of treated parents. This serves to
measure the “technical” part of the take-up, as related to the actual delivery of the
messages. We also collected data on the installation of W8 parental control setting
through our call center. This measure captures the take-up of the W8 treatment directly
from us, though parents could also install parental control software by other means.
Then, after the treatment ended, we applied a brief phone interview between
April and early May 2014 to explore some potential mechanisms underlying our
estimated impacts. We were able to contact 5,001 parents who consented to participate
in this follow-up survey. This is equivalent to 57% of the original sample. The lower rate
is mostly a consequence of the difficulty in reaching parents on the phone; the rejection
rate of the survey was only about 14%. The survey includes a series of questions about

11

parent recollections of receiving SMSs, the usefulness of the SMSs, and the decision to
install the parental control software, as well as parental behavior and parenting styles.8
Finally, in order to help with the interpretation of our results, we constructed a
proxy for time use using information from students of the 2012 YEMPC cohort. For this
earlier cohort, we have information on both MBs (downloaded and uploaded) and time
of internet connection for a sample of 48,920 students for 125 days (from mid-April to
early December, 2012). Using this information we estimated OLS regressions models
with time of internet use as a non-linear functions (including interactions) of MB
downloaded, MB uploaded, dummies for the day of the week, dummies for holidays, and
dummies for discrete levels of use (four categories that reflect higher, high, normal, low
use). We use the specification with the highest R2 (0.621) to impute time of internet use
for our sample. We present these estimates to aid in the interpretation of our main
results and use them as robustness checks.
Table 3 shows balance in the main demographic characteristics for our sample
across each of our treatment arms, T1, T2, and T3 relative to the control group T0. The
F-test presented in the last column rejects balance at the 10% level for just one variable:
whether the child lives with their mother.9 Still, the differences in averages for this
variable across groups do not seem to be economically large. We control for this vector
of covariates in some of our regression specifications and, not surprisingly given the
balance across treatment arms, our coefficients remain largely unchanged.

Appendix Table 1 compares baseline characteristics between the baseline and follow-up samples.
Appendix Table 2 presents balance tests for the random/fixed schedule sub-treatments and Appendix
Table 3 presents balance tests for the survey sample. We only observe two unbalanced variables for the
random/fixed schedule comparisons (out of 20), and with small differences: the random-schedule
households have slightly fewer parents with complete higher education (1 p.p.) and were present with a
higher probability in the other category group for current employment status (1.p.p.).

3.2 Empirical Strategy
We consider two alternative approaches for estimating the impact of our main
interventions on internet use. First, we compare average internet use across households
allocated to the different treatment groups. This allows us to identify the average effect
on internet use over the entire treatment period, and beyond. Second, we analyze the
effects of the actual receipt of the SMS messages using an event study framework in
which we exploit within-event variation in internet use at the daily level. This enables
us to better understand the mechanisms behind the changes in behavior.
For the first approach, we adopt the standard specification used to analyze
randomized experiments by separately identifying the impacts of each treatment arm,
T1, T2, or T3 relative to our control group T0:
𝑌𝑖 = 𝛽′𝑋𝑖 + 𝛿1 𝑇1𝑖 + 𝛿2 𝑇2𝑖 + 𝛿3 𝑇3𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖
where 𝑌𝑖 is a measure of internet use for household 𝑖. Our set of control variables (𝑋𝑖 )
includes strata fixed effects and internet use in the pre-treatment period; in some
specification we also include demographic characteristics collected at baseline. The
coefficient on T1 captures the effect of receiving ISP information with respect to the
control group T0, the coefficient on T2 captures the effect of receiving information on
how to install parental controls with respect to the control group, and T3 captures the
effect of receiving information on both ISP and how to install parental controls. To the
extent that not all of the SMSs sent are actually received, these coefficients will reflect
intention-to-treat (ITT) parameters. These coefficients can be scaled up by the fraction
of messages received, although as shown below, the vast majority of SMSs sent were
actually received.

13

To further improve precision, we also consider an alternative regression model
that accounts for the fact that group T3 effectively receives both of the treatments
provided to groups T1 and T2:
𝑌𝑖 = 𝛽′𝑋𝑖 + 𝛿1 𝐼𝑆𝑃_𝐼𝑛𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖 + 𝛿2 𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑙𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑠𝑖 + 𝜖𝑖
where 𝑌𝑖 and 𝑋𝑖 are defined as before, 𝐼𝑆𝑃_𝐼𝑛𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖 is an indicator for households
that are either in group T1 or T3, and 𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑙𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑠𝑖 is an indicator for households
that are either in group T1 or T3. Thus, we simultaneously estimate the impact of
parents receiving ISP information and assistance with W8 parental controls regardless
of whether they are in T1, T2, or T3. This specification assumes that there are no
complementarities between the two separate SMS scripts. As shown below, we do not
observe any significant effects for T2 relative to the control group and the estimated
impacts for T3 are similar to those estimated for T1. Therefore, we believe that the
assumption underlying this alternative model generally holds true.
For the second approach, we estimate the effect of each SMS “event” on internet
use in the days immediately preceding and following the day on which the message was
sent. We stack all the events for each sub-treatment and estimate the following model:
−2

𝑌𝑖𝑑𝑒 = ∑

𝜃𝑑 𝐷𝑑 + ∑

𝑑=−3

−2

𝑡=0

−2

𝑑=−3

𝜃𝑑𝐼𝑆𝑃 𝐷𝑑 ∗ 𝐼𝑆𝑃𝑖

𝑡=0

𝜃𝑑𝑃𝐶 𝐷𝑑 ∗ 𝑃𝐶𝑖 + 𝜇𝑒 + 𝑒𝑖𝑑𝑒

or, with abuse of notation (because we are not explicitly excluding d = -1)

𝑌𝑖𝑑𝑒 = ∑

𝜃𝑑 𝐷𝑑 + ∑

3

𝜃𝑑𝐼𝑆𝑃 𝐷𝑑 ∗ 𝐼𝑆𝑃𝑖 + ∑

𝑑=−3

𝜃𝑑𝑃𝐶 𝐷𝑑 ∗ 𝑃𝐶𝑖 + 𝜇𝑒 + 𝜀𝑖𝑑𝑒

𝑑=−3

where Y and i are defined as before, d refers to the day, e refers to the event, ISP is a
dummy that takes a value of 1 for households in the ISP information group, PC is a
dummy that takes a value of 1 for households in the parental controls group, D refers to
14

day dummy variables, and e denote the event fixed effects. This approach allows us to
estimate a vector of coefficients that capture differences in internet use with respect to
day -1 (the day before actually receiving the treatment) for each treatment groups. For
instance, -3 measures the difference in internet use three days before receiving the
message with respect to the day before the message was received for the control group,
(-3 + -3ISP) is the same effect for households in the ISP information group, and (-3 + 3PC)

for the parental control group.
We also estimate the impact of our sub-treatments in which we vary whether the

SMSs are sent in a predictable or unpredictable fashion. To do this, we estimate the
following regression model:
𝑌𝑖 = 𝛽′𝑋𝑖 + 𝜌𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑚𝑖 + 𝜇𝑖
where Randomi equals 1 if the SMSs were sent on a random day of the week and 0 if the
SMSs were sent on the same day of each week. The coefficient 𝜌 captures the impact of
receiving the message on a random day relative to a fixed day of the week.
Finally, we consider a specification that allows for the interaction of our main
treatments that provide ISP information or parental controls with our sub-treatments
which vary whether the SMSs were sent in a predictable or unpredictable fashion:
𝑌𝑖 = 𝛽′ 𝑋𝑖 + 𝛿1 𝐼𝑆𝑃_𝐼𝑛𝑓𝑜𝑖 + 𝛿2 𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑙𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑠𝑖 + 𝜌1 𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑚𝑖
+ 𝜂(𝐼𝑆𝑃_𝐼𝑛𝑓𝑜𝑖 ∗ 𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑚𝑖 ) + 𝜃(𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑙𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑠𝑖 ∗ 𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑚𝑖 ) + 𝜇𝑖
The coefficients η and θ indicate whether providing information and parental controls
are complements (or substitutes) with the strength or salience of the cue.

3.3 Take-up
We begin by showing the patterns of take-up using our administrative data in Table 4.
Columns (1) and (2) confirm that households were correctly targeted to receive SMSs
15

with information about internet use from the ISP provider. From Panel A, those in
groups T1 and T3 received approximately 82 percent of these SMSs whereas those in
group T2 and the control group did not receive them. This is also apparent when using
our alternative regression model in Panel B to estimate the combined impact of
providing ISP Information from T1 and T3. Similarly, columns (3) and (4) confirm that
households were correctly targeted to receive SMSs regarding the Windows 8 parental
control software. Those in groups T2 and T3 received 83 percent and 81 percent of
these SMSs while those in group T1 and the control group did not receive them at all.10
The imperfect compliance in the administrative data represents cases in which
the SMS messages were not delivered due to technical issues (i.e. server problems, lack
of reception, etc.). However, as shown in Appendix Table 4, the vast majority of parents
received at least one message (98% in the case of T1 and T2 and 97% in the case T3).
Finally, columns (5) and (6) of Table 4 show that about 14 percent of households in
treatment group T2 and 16 percent of households in group T3 received assistance from
us with installing the W8 parental control software; as expected, these rates were zero
in treatment group T1 and the control group.11
After treatment ended, we also asked parents about their recollections of
receiving SMSs, the usefulness of the SMSs, and their decision to install parental control
software. Column (1) of Panel A in Table 5 indicates no significant differences in
whether parents recalled ever receiving an SMS across the different treatment arms T1,
T2 and T3, relative to a base of 86 percent in the control group. This is not surprising

Panel B does show a small but significant effect of the combined impact of ISP Information from T1 and
T3 on the likelihood of receiving SMSs regarding W8 parental control software. This is a result of the
small differences in take-up between T2 and T3.

and T3 on the likelihood of installing the W8 parental control software as a result of the small differences
in take-up between T2 and T3.

given that all households were sent a weekly SMS (though Panel B does suggest that
slightly fewer parents who received the Parental Control interventions report ever
receiving an SMS). However, column (2) indicates that, among parents in group T2 who
only received an SMS regarding W8 parental controls, significantly fewer remembered
what the SMS actually said as compared to the control group. In contrast, among
parents in groups T1 and T3 who received an SMS regarding the ISP internet use,
significantly more remembered what the SMS actually said as compared to the control
group. This differential rate of recall may also explain some of the differences in the
impacts between the IPS and W8 interventions.
Columns (3)-(6) show whether, conditional on reporting the receipt of an SMS,
parents found the SMSs useful. As expected, parents in groups T1 and T3 who received
SMSs providing information about their children’s internet use were significantly more
likely to find these messages useful for being informed about internet use. While about
20 percent of parents in the control group discussed the SMSs with their kids, this
fraction more than doubles for parents in groups that received information. Parents in
groups T2 and T3 who received SMSs about the W8 parental controls were significantly
more likely to find them useful for learning about tools that would be helpful to monitor
use. We also find that, despite the fact that all treatment arms also contained a sentence
reminding parents to ensure their children made good use of the computer, fewer
households in treatment groups T1, T2, and T3 reported that their messages were
useful for this purpose as compared to the control group which contained only this
sentence. This present a first indication for the limited attention of parents; including
additional content in the SMS may have led parents to pay less attention to the first part
of the SMS.

17

Column (7) indicates that parents in groups T2 and T3 who received information
about the W8 parental controls software were more likely to install it. Yet there is also
evidence that some parents in group T1 and the control group succeeded in installing
parental control software despite not receiving any assistance from us. Furthermore,
while the estimates are not significant, column (8) suggests that parents may have used
the internet more themselves. The positive coefficients are consistent with the
possibility that parents increased use in order to supervise and monitor their children.
Overall, our administrative and survey data suggest that the interventions worked as
intended and that the actual content of the SMSs did matter. Nevertheless, take-up
associated with installing the Windows 8 (W8) parental control software was quite low.

4. Main Results
This section describes our main results on the role of information, parental controls,
and cues for parental monitoring and supervision of children’s internet use.
4.1 Information
We begin with a discussion of the aggregate impacts of providing parents with ISP
information on the intensity of internet use. Across the different specifications in Panel
A of Table 6, there is evidence that households in group T1 in which parents received
the ISP information about internet use had lower intensity of internet use during the
treatment period. The daily reduction of 11-16 megabytes used represents a 6-10
percent decrease relative to the control group. The impacts for households in group T3,
in which parents were provided with both information about internet use and help
installing parental controls, are negative but somewhat smaller in magnitude and less
significant than those for T1. A broadly similar pattern is observed in Panel B where the

18

increased precision yields a highly significant impact of providing ISP Information from
T1 and T3 combined.
These results indicate that providing parents with specific information about
their children’s internet use leads to a significant reduction of 6-10 percent in
contemporaneous internet use. This translates to a daily reduction of about 8 minutes
of internet use in households that received the ISP information intervention (see
Appendix Table 5 for estimates in terms of predicted minutes of use). We take this as
evidence of a reduction in children’s internet use because we did not observe declines
in parents’ report of their own use (in column 8 of Table 5).
For the most part, the impacts of our interventions are similar across weekdays
and weekends. This may be because the patterns of internet use and parental
monitoring do not vary between weekdays and weekends. Indeed, we do not see large
differences in internet use for the control group between weekdays and weekends;
average internet use is 169.4 and 167.6 for weekdays and weekends respectively.
However, it is also possible that there are countervailing forces at play. For example,
children’s demand for internet may be higher during weekends but the ability of
parents to monitor their children’s internet use may also be correspondingly greater.
We do observe variation in treatment impacts for different levels of internet use
using quantile regressions. Figure 2 plots the point estimates for the impact of
providing ISP information for different quintiles of the distribution of outcomes (the
underlying coefficients are in Appendix Table A6). The effects of providing information
are concentrated in children above the median, and the absolute value of these
estimates increases almost monotonically from -12 MBs for quintile 45 to -64 MBs for
quintile 95. These results suggest that the effects of the informational intervention were

19

concentrated among children with high levels of use, and who may have benefitted the
most from a reduction in internet use.
We also explore the high-frequency dynamics of our interventions by
implementing an event study analysis that exploits the timing of the messages within
each week.12 The results are presented in Panel A of Figure 3 which plots coefficient
estimates for the control group (SMS-only), the information treatment (ISP info) group,
and the parental control group (PC). Day 0 marks the day on which the SMSs are
received each week, although the messages were received in the afternoon so we may
expect larger impacts on the following day (day 1). For ease of comparison, we
normalize all of the coefficients to equal zero on the day prior to receipt of the SMS (day
-1). These coefficients are also presented in Appendix Table 7 along with their standard
errors.
We do not observe a trend for any of the groups in the days preceding receipt of
the SMS (days -3 to -1). However, we do see significant differences emerge as the SMSs
are received by the households. Internet use starts declining for the ISP Info group on
day 0, declines further on day 1, and remains below the internet use in the days before
the SMS is received. The plot for the control group does not follow the same pattern.
While there is a small decrease on day 1, this quickly reverts to the level of the days
before the messages were sent. This confirms that the receipt of the SMS messages
themselves leads to a discernible effect on internet use.
The impact associated with the actual content of the message received by the
ISP-info group is shown in the two bottom panels of Figure 3. In particular, we split the
sample between those receiving a message stating that internet use in the previous

This approach is similar to one taken by Alcott and Rogers (2014) in their paper examining the effect of
providing information to electricity consumers.
12

20

week was “above” the mean of the reference group and those receiving a message
stating that internet use was the “same or below” the mean. The results indicate that the
observed effects in the top panel of Figure 3 are driven by those SMS messages
containing “bad news” for the parents. We do not see a similar pattern for the other two
groups, which suggests that this is not explained by mean-reversion in internet use.13
This further confirms that the actual content of the message matters and not simply the
receipt of the SMS messages.
To summarize, these results suggest that providing parents with information
about their children’s internet use helps to alleviate their lack of information. By having
a control group that also receives an SMS message, we can isolate the impact of
information from the cue associated with the message itself. Moreover, the evidence
from our event study analysis showing that message content drives the impacts only
serves to reinforce the fact that it is the information itself which generates the causal
impact on internet use.

4.2 Parental Controls
Next we consider the impact of offering assistance with installing parental control
software on the intensity of internet use. Looking at Panel A of Table 6, we see no
significant effects for households in group T2 in which parents were provided with
information about installing parental controls; if anything, the coefficients are slightly
positive. There are also no significant effects in Panel B where we estimate the
(combined) impact of offering parental control software from T2 and T3; the point

We also verified that a similar pattern is observed when restricting to only the first SMS. Thus, when
the first SMS received indicates that internet use is “above” average, there is a significant reduction in
internet use in the days immediately after. Interestingly, when the first SMS indicates that internet use is
“similar or below” average, there is actually an increase in internet use in the days immediately after.
13

21

estimates are all clustered close to zero. Thus, the aggregate data suggests that offering
parents with assistance to install parental control software is not an effective way of
changing behavior. This is also in line with results from the event study analysis. In
contrast to the patterns observed for the informational treatment, Figure 3 shows no
discernable impact of parental control intervention on intensity of internet use in the
days immediately following receipt of the SMS message. Finally, the quantile
regressions in Figure 2 and Appendix Table A6 do not reveal any heterogeneous effects
of parental controls by the level of internet use.
As a further exercise, we consider an alternative event-study analysis in which
we estimate the short-term impact of actually installing W8 parental control software.
Since we provided assistance with installing parental control software to families in
treatment groups T2 and T3, we know the precise date on which each of the 564
parents who called received this assistance. These dates are staggered through January
(after which no more calls were received), which allows us to estimate an event study
that controls for seasonality, similar to those used in estimating the impact of receiving
an SMS. The results of this analysis are shown in Figure 4 and Appendix Table 8 which
indicate no significant short-term impacts in the days immediately after installation of
the W8 parental control software. Given that the decision to install parental control
software could be endogenous to internet use, these findings need to be interpreted
with care. However, they are consistent with our previous results.
The absence of significant impacts from providing assistance for installing
parental control software could indicate that parents already have access to other
means of controlling their children’s computer use. This may also explain the low rate of
take-up for this intervention. Alternatively, the low rate of take-up could reflect the
considerable obstacles faced by low-income parents in implementing technological
22

solutions for monitoring and supervising their children. As noted previously, parents in
this treatment arm were more likely to report learning about tools that can be helpful in
monitoring their children. But perhaps such parents need more hands-on assistance to
actually use parental control software on their children’s computers.14 Moreover,
installing and operating parental control software can impose substantial time costs
which may lead to procrastination, status-quo bias, and other biases that arise with the
demand for commitment devices (see Bryan et al., 2010 for a review).

4.3 Cues
As explained above, our interventions were designed to separate the informational
content and the offer of assistance with parental control software from the cue
associated with the SMS messages. This section presents additional evidence suggesting
that the cues themselves also play an important role in affected parental behavior.
First, we use our event study framework to show that SMS messages sent to the
control group had short-term impacts in the first weeks of the experiment. Figure 5 and
Appendix Table 9 present the impacts from the event study for each treatment group
during the first and second half of the treatment period. We discuss the implications of
these patterns for the persistence of our main interventions in a subsequent section.
However, it is notable that there is a negative and statistically significant decrease of
about 10 MBs the day after SMS messages were received for the control group during
the first half of the treatment period. This suggests that the salience of the message also
matters since the SMS messages without specific information on internet use are likely
to be more salient at the beginning of the experiment.
We have examined which parental characteristics predict take-up of the W8 parental control software.
The strongest predictors are the gender of the student (less likely to install for females) and the stated
intention to install parental control software in the baseline survey.
14

23

Second, we consider the effect of varying the strength of the cue associated with
messages by sending them in either a predictable or unpredictable fashion. For each
treatment arm, a random subset of households received SMSs on the same day of the
week (this fixed day was randomly drawn for households) while the remainder of
households received SMSs on a random day of the week. Table 7 examines the effect of
receiving SMSs on a random versus a fixed schedule. Households who received SMSs on
a random schedule had reductions of 10-15 MBs in daily internet use relative to
households on fixed schedules. This is similar in magnitude to the main effect associated
with receiving ISP information, and suggests that the strength of the cue associated to
the message is as important as the message itself.
We believe these findings are consistent with research in neuroscience and
psychology finding that unpredictable and novelty stimuli have larger impacts (e.g.
Parkin, 1997; Berns et al., 2001; Fenker et al., 2008). They are also related to research in
behavioral economics that emphasizes the role of inattention in the context of
reminders (e.g., Karlan, et al. 2014, Taubinsky 2014, Ericsson, 2017). An alternative
explanation for these patterns is that random schedules allow for more flexible
responses by parents when receiving a message is not as convenient on some days (and
the impact of repeated messages is non-linear). In this case, we would expect to find
heterogeneous treatment effects by the day of the week in which the message was
delivered. However, we do not find statistically significant differences across days.

5. The Role of Parents
Since our interventions were targeted at parents, it is important to understand how our
main impacts are moderated by parental characteristics and mediated by parental

24

behavior. This section uses information from both the baseline and endline survey to
explore the role of parents in our ISP information intervention.

5.1 Parents as Moderators
We begin with Table 8 which presents interactions of our main estimates with baseline
variables capturing household structure, parental involvement, and perceptions of use.
Panels A and B show that the largest responses to our ISP information intervention
occur in families where internet use is less likely to be observed by parents: the
reductions in internet use are larger when the mother is not a “stay-at-home” mom vs. a
“stay-at-home” mom (14.5MB vs. 8.5MB) and larger in single parent families vs. nonsingle parent families (26.2MB vs. 3.9 MB). This suggests that our informational
intervention is most useful when it is difficult to supervise a child during the day.
In the third panel of Table 8, we use information from the baseline to construct
an index of parental involvement and compare households with high vs. low levels of
parental involvement.15 The reductions in Internet use associated with our ISP
information intervention are substantially larger (23.1 MB vs 7.8) for parents that are
highly involved vs. those less involved. This difference suggests that parental
involvement might be a necessary prerequisite for using the information that we
provide effectively. In other words, our informational interventions may substitute for
the presence of a parent at home but are complementary to parental capacity to be
involved in their children’s lives. Interestingly, we do not observe much difference in
the impact of our interventions by mother’s education (fourth panel of Table 8), which

This index is based on three questions asking about parental involvement in their children’s school life
(helping them with homework, communicating with their teachers, etc.).
15

25

suggests that our previous results are not driven by differences in human capital across
families.
If, as argued earlier, our results are driven through an informational channel,
then one should expect heterogeneous responses from parents who had different priors
about their children’s internet use at baseline, and when these priors did not match the
realization of actual use. The last panel of Table 8 distinguishes between four groups of
parents along two dimensions: those who had a high (low) perception of their children’s
internet use at baseline, and those whose children have high (low) levels of actual
internet use in the period prior to the start of the interventions.16 As expected, the
largest reduction in internet use is for misinformed parents with low perceptions of
internet use at baseline and high actual use. The impacts are also considerably larger for
parents who are correct in their prior perception that their children had high levels of
internet use.17

5.2 Parents as Mediators
In Table 9, we use information from the endline survey to better understand how
parent-child interactions might have been affected by the informational interventions.
Column (1) indicates that parents who receive information about their children’s
internet use are 1.7 percentage points more likely (on a base of 7.2%) to report that
their children had problems with computer use. Column (2) reveals that parents who
receive information are 1.5 percentage points more likely (on a base of 7%) to report

We define parents with high (low) perception as those who say that believe their child uses (not) “too
much internet” in the baseline survey; we define parents whose children have high (low) actual use as
those who have above (below) average use in the pre-treatment period.
17 For the most part, the heterogeneous responses in Table 8 for the Parental Control intervention are not
different along the same dimensions of parent characteristics. This is not surprising given the absence of
a treatment effect for this intervention.
16

26

punishing their child in response to these problems. However, in column (3), some
parents are also more likely to report discussing these computer problems with their
children in a calm manner. Finally, in column (4), parents who receive ISP information
are more likely to report that decisions about internet use are backed by information.
The last three columns of Table 9 present indices based on variables from the
endline survey that measure alternative parenting styles (authoritative, authoritarian
and permissive). While these results are somewhat noisy, there is some evidence that
parents in the ISP Information group are less likely to be classified as having a
permissive parenting style.
Together, these results help shed light on the mechanisms underlying our main
results. The results in Table 8 suggest that our informational interventions substitute
for the presence of a parent at home but are complementary to parents’ capacity to be
involved in their children’s lives. Moreover, parents who believe their children use too
much internet have the largest reductions in internet use. This evidence is consistent
with the view that the information helped parents better monitor and supervise their
children. The results in Table 9 further suggest that our intervention may have changed
the equilibrium level of internet use through increases in punishments, discussions
surrounding internet use, and a less permissive parenting style.

6. Further Results
6.1 Persistence
If our informational interventions provided parents with new tools to address the
challenge of monitoring and supervising their children, we would expect the main
impacts to persist. On the other hand, if parents depend on the SMSs themselves to help
them monitor and supervise their children, these effects would likely disappear when
27

they stop receiving their SMSs. To answer this important question, we analyze the
impact of our treatments during the period after the interventions had ended (i.e. the
“post-treatment period”).
We consider the broad patterns over time in Figure 6, which shows the
treatment effects for each week in the pre-treatment period, treatment period, and
post-treatment period (relative to the control group). We observe that the treatment
effects remain at a similar level even after the interventions conclude in week 14. This
indicates that our main impacts did persist following the treatment period. A similar
picture emerges in the regression results presented in Table 10, which confirm that
there are significant impacts even after the treatment ends, at roughly the same order of
magnitude as the impacts during the second half of the treatment period.18 Not
surprisingly, when we use our event-study framework, we do not find any significant
effect during the post-treatment period when the SMSs were not actually received.
These results are shown in Figure 7 which presents the event study impacts in the posttreatment period restricted to the fixed schedule sub-treatment.19
The persistence of our impacts bolster the evidence presented in section 5, and
are consistent with the notion that the ISP informational intervention may have led to
persistent effects by changing the nature of parent-child interactions.

6.2 Dynamics

The experiment took place during both the vacation period (from December, 2013 to early March
2014) and the school period (from early March onwards). This has an important overlap with the
analyses we perform in this section. Appendix Table A10 estimates treatment effects for the last two
weeks of the vacation period and the first two weeks of the school period in order to compare the effect of
the treatment while in vacation and while in school. These results suggest the treatment effects are not
substantially different for the vacation and school period and, therefore, we conclude that the dynamic
effects we present in this section are probably unrelated to this alternative explanation.
19 We only use information for the individuals who received messages on a fixed day of the week because
it is not obvious how to show “placebo” impacts in the post-treatment period for the subsample of
individuals who received messages on a random day of the week.
18

28

Did the impacts associated with our interventions display different dynamics during the
treatment period? We begin with Figure 6, which also shows the impacts for the
treatment period (relative to the control group). The impacts of the ISP information
treatment build up during the first 4 weeks of treatment and then appear to stabilize
through the rest of the treatment period. This pattern is confirmed in Table 10, which
presents coefficient estimates for the impact of each treatment for the first-half of the
treatment (from weeks 1 to 7) and for the second half of the treatment (weeks 8 to 14).
Figure 5 presents the impacts from the event study for the first and second half
of the treatment period. The immediate effects of providing ISP information were
clearly stronger in the first-half of the treatment period. Appendix Table 9 presents the
coefficients and standard errors corresponding to these plots. They show large
decreases in internet use of approximately 13 MBs on the day the SMS was received and
20 MBs one day after receipt of the SMS. In contrast, the impacts in the second half of
the sample, while still negative, are not statistically significant. Thus, the immediate
effect of receiving the SMSs themselves appears to fade out midway through the
treatment period, and the persistence of the aggregate impacts must be due to other
changes in parent and child behavior, as described in section 5.
Next, we decompose the heterogeneous response in the first and second half of
the treatment period between the random and fixed subgroups. In Figure 8, we plot the
relative impact of receiving an SMS message in an unpredictable fashion for each week
in the pre-treatment, treatment and post-treatment periods. We observe that the
(negative) impact becomes larger in magnitude during the second part of the treatment
period. This is not surprising if it takes parents time to discern whether the messages
are arriving in predictable or unpredictable fashion (parents were not informed about
the manner in which the SMSs would be delivered). A similar pattern emerges in Figure
29

9 where the short-term effects of the fixed and random groups are similar in the first
half of the treatment period, but only observed for the random group by the second part
of the treatment period
These results provide complementary evidence on why the cues associated with
an SMS message have an impact in our analysis. The different dynamics of random
versus fixed messages during the first and second part of the intervention are consistent
with the view that the increased strength of the cue for random-schedule messages
should be more relevant in the second part of the intervention after recipients on the
fixed-schedule have likely become accustomed to receiving their messages on the same
day every week.

6.3 Interactions between treatments
Finally, we consider the interaction between our main treatments that sent SMSs
providing ISP Information about internet use and Parental Control software with our
sub-treatments that varied whether those SMSs were received on a random or a fixed
schedule. These interactions effects are displayed in Table 11 for our combined
treatments and in Appendix Table 11 for the separate treatments. In both cases, we
observe main effects that are similar to the ones estimated in previous tables: receiving
SMSs with ISP Information about internet use leads to significantly lower internet use;
receiving reminders/assistance for installing Parental Control software has a negative
but statistically insignificant impact on internet use; and receiving SMSs on a random
schedule leads to very large and significant reductions in internet use.
The interaction effects between ISP information and indicators for a random
schedule are consistently positive, albeit not significant (a similar pattern holds with
respect to the interaction between the random schedule and the Parental Control
30

group). This suggests that ISP information and any cue associated with a random
schedule are, if anything, substitutes and not complements. In other words, providing
specific information appears to crowd out the effect of the cue associated with the
message, although this effect is not significant.

7. Conclusion
Parents are often confronted with the challenge of supervising their children’s actions.
This challenge has become even more pressing with the increasing availability of
internet access at home which may displace productive activities and expose students
to inappropriate content. Our paper examines the role of imperfect information among
parents and the potential for direct parental controls in affecting children’s internet use.
We designed and implemented a set of randomized experiments to test whether the
intensity of children’s internet use responds to the provision of specific information
about children’s internet use and to the offer of assistance with the installation of
parental control software. The sample includes children in 7th and 8th grade who
received free computers and 12 months of free internet through Chile’s “Yo Elijo mi PC”
(YEMPC) program in 2013, and we take advantage of detailed information on the
intensity of internet use at the daily level from the internet service provider (ISP) which
served all of the computers provided to the children in our sample.
Our results show that sending parents SMSs with information about their
children’s internet use leads to substantial reductions in use: households in which
parents received ISP information about internet use had a significantly lower intensity
of internet use during the treatment period as compared to households in the control
group who received a generic SMS. We observe statistically significant reductions in use
precisely on the days immediately after receiving the ISP information. Furthermore, it is
31

those SMS messages indicating that children used more internet than the reference
group in a specific week, which produce the largest declines in internet use.
Accordingly, the impacts of providing ISP information to parents are concentrated in the
upper quintiles of the distribution of internet use. We find no impact of receiving
assistance with the installation of parental control software on the intensity of internet
use. Moreover, we do not observe short-term impacts of actually installing parental
control software among the families that received assistance.
Taken together, these findings indicate that providing parents with specific
information about their children’s internet use affect behavior while providing parents
with parental control software does not. The fact that the impacts of information effects
persist after treatment ends suggests that our temporary intervention may have altered
the equilibrium level of internet use and alleviated the problem of imperfect
information in a more permanent way. Consistent with this, we find that parents who
received ISP information were more likely to punish their children or discuss the
problems of internet use with their children, as well as some evidence that parenting
styles become less permissive.
We also find strong evidence that households who received SMSs with an
unpredictable schedule experienced significantly greater reductions in internet use
than those on predictable schedules, an effect similar in magnitude to the main effect
associated with receiving the ISP information. In addition, we find that the SMS
messages sent to the control group had short-term impacts on internet use in the first
weeks of the experiment, perhaps due to the novelty of the message. These findings
suggest that the cues associated with messages have an independent effect on behavior
and that the strength of such cues is an important determinant of our outcomes. Thus,
our study sheds light on the role of information and cues in affecting behavior.

Note: This table presents estimated effects on take-up for different treatment groups with respect to the control group.
Columns 1 and 2 present estimates on the receipt of SMSs with ISP information. Columns 3 and 4 present estimates on the
reception of SMSs including an offer of help to install parental control settings. Columnd 5 and 6 present estimates on the
installation of parental control settings through the call center of the experiment. We control for strata fixed effects and
internet use in the pre-period in all specification. Even-numbered columns present estimates including additional baseline
control variables. Control variables include the baseline values of mean of MBs of Internet use; guardian gender, age,
education level and employment status; number of siblings; and dummies for family composition (indicating whether the
child lives with mother, father, step-mother or father’s partner, step-father or mother’s partner, uncle/aunt, brother/sister,
grandfather/grandmother, other relatives, and other non-relatives). Robust estimated standard errors are reported in
parentheses. *** Significant at the 1 percent level. ** Significant at the 5 percent level. * Significant at the 10 percent
level.

Note: This table presents estimated effects on Internet use measured as daily average MBs uploaded and downloaded. We control
for strata fixed effects and internet use in the pre-period in all specification. Even-numbered columns present estimates including
additional baseline control variables. Control variables include the baseline values of mean of MBs of Internet use; guardian
gender, age, education level and employment status; number of siblings; and dummies for family composition (indicating whether
the child lives with mother, father, step-mother or father’s partner, step-father or mother’s partner, uncle/aunt, brother/sister,
grandfather/grandmother, other relatives, and other non-relatives). Robust estimated standard errors are reported in parentheses.

Note: This table presents estimated effects for different treatment groups with respect
to the control group. Columns 1 and 2 present estimates on the reception of at
least one SMS including ISP information. Columns 3 and 4 present estimates on the
reception of at least one SMS including an offer of help to install parental control
settings. Odd-numbered columns present estimates controlling for MB Use at baseline
and even-numbered columns present estimates including all baseline control variables.
Control variables include the baseline values of mean of MBs of Internet use; guardian
gender, age, education level and employment status; number of siblings; and dummies
for family composition (indicating whether the child lives with mother, father, stepmother or father’s partner, step-father or mother’s partner, uncle/aunt, brother/sister,
grandfather/grandmother, other relatives, and other non-relatives). Robust estimated
standard errors are reported in parentheses. *** Significant at the 1 percent level. **
Significant at the 5 percent level. * Significant at the 10 percent level.
