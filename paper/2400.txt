Introducti on

Understanding the behavior of real interest rates is a central
issue in monetary/macro economics.1 In previous research on this topic,
several approaches have been used to measure real interest rates. In one
approach, real interest rates have been calculated by subtracting survey

data on inflation expectations, such as the Livingston data, from
nominal interest rates.2 The problem with survey—based measures of real

Interest rates is that they are only as good as the survey measure of
inflation expectations and there may be little incentive for the survey

respondents to answer accurately. An even more telling criticism of
survey—based measures, often Ignored In the literature, is that the
behavior of market expectations is driven by economic agents at the
margin who are eliminating unexploited profit opportunities. Market
expectations are unlikely, therefore, to be well measured by the average
expectations of survey respondents.3

Because of doubts about survey—based measures of real interest
rates, other researchers have used the assumption of rational expecta-

tions and ex—post real interest rate data calculated with aggregate

Here, the term "real Interest rate" refers to the ax—ante real
interest rate, that Is the expected real return an a bond. When
referring to the actual realized real return on a bond, the term
"ex—post real interest rate" will be used,

For example, see Gibson (1972), Cargill (1976), Lahiri (1976),
Carlson (1977), Levi and Makin (1979), Tanzi (1980) and Wilcox

price level data to make inferences about real interest rate behavior.4
There are several difficulties with this approach as well. First is the
need for the rational expectations assumption. Although rational expectations Is a maintained hypothesis in much current research in monetary

economics, there are questions about Its validity particularly when

there is a shift from one policy regime to another. An additional
problem with this approach is that unanticipated inflation appears as a

component of the error term in the statistical analysis. As a result,

statistical tests may have low power. Another consequence of the
presence of unanticipated inflation in the error term is

that the

variability of real interest rates cannot be examined directly.

Because of the difficulties with the analysis of ex—post real
interest rates derived with aggregate price level data, recent research

has begun to use futures market data to examine real interest rate
behavior.6 Futures market data can be used to directly construct own—

i.e.,

commodity real interest rates ——

the ex—ante real return on a bond

in terms of specific commodities —— and then the own—commodity real
rates can be used to make Inferences about the real interest rate for

the aggregate economy. This approach avoids the use of the rational
expectations assumption and eliminates unanticipated inflation from the

error term, while allowing the researcher to directly examine the
variability of real Interest rates.

Despite the advantages of futures market data for examining real
interest rates, it does suffer from one major potential disadvantage.

Own—commodity real rates constructed using futures market data contain

not only information about the real interest rate for the aggregate
economy, but also information about ax—ante relative price movements If
the ax—ante relative price movements (which can be thought of as noise)

are greater in magnitude than movements in the aggregate real interest
rate (the signal), then the noise to signal ratio in own—commodity real

rates will be high. Own—commodity real rates constructed using futures

market data might thus contain little information about the aggregate
real interest rate, which is of primary concern to economists.

This paper examines whether futures market data can be used to
understand the behavior of real interest rates1 The conclusion is

a

negative ones Futures market data do not appear to be particularly
informative about real Interest rates.7 In coming to this conclusion,
the paper examines the data In several ways. First, the ex—ante relative

price movement embedded in the own—commodity real rates (the noise) is

calculated to be on th. order of over one hundred times more variable
than the aggregate real interest rate (the signal). Own—commodity real
rates are thus unlikely to contain much information about the aggregate

real interest rate. Second, several widely accepted facts about the
behavior of aggregate real interest rates in the 1980s are not at all

More precisely stated, the conclusion is that own—commodity real
rates constructed with futures market data for specific commodities
cannot be used to understand the behavior of aggregate real interest

rates. However, reliable data from a futures contract for an aggregate price level index, such as the CPI, would get around the
problems described in this paper. There is currently a CPI futures
contract which is traded on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange,
but data from this contract cannot be used to understand the recent
behavior of real interest rates. The CPI futures contract has not
been very successful and so has very low trading volume. The thinness of the market thus makes the data suspect. In addition, the
contract has only been traded since June of 1985, so that no data is
available to examine the behavior of real interest rates around the
critical date of October 1979,

4

evident in the own—commodity real rate data. Thus, analysis of own—
commodity real rates provides a misleading impression of aggregate real

rate movements for a period which displays the most striking movements

of real interest rates in the postwar period. Finally, an econometric
analysis of own—commodity real rate behavior fails to find evidence of a

shift in the behavior of real interest rates when the monetary policy
regime changes in October 1979, a finding that ii at odds with previous
strong findings in the literature.

Th. overall strategy of the paper has been to beat the data with a

rubber hose ——

i.e.,

to look at the own—commodity real rate data in as

many ways as possible. All the evidence consistently casts doubt on the

usefulness of futures market data for understanding real interest rate

behavior. Not only does this cast serious doubt about some of the
results in previous research such as Cornell and French (1986) and
Hamilton (1986) that make use of futures market data to draw inferences
about real interest rates, but it also indicates that future research on
real interest rates must turn to a different line of attack.

A Comparison of Methodologies

The own—commodity real rate for a particular commodity equals the
ex—ante return on a one—period bond in terms of that specific commodity.
With the existence of a futures market, an Investor can lock in this cx—
ante real return at time t by selling the commodity J at a price of

use the proceeds to purchase a one—period bond with a rominal return
(interest rate) of i, and then transform the proceeds received at time

t+1 back into the commodity at the futures price set at time t, F. The

• th. spot price at time t for commodity i.

An attractive feature of the own—commodity real rate rr defined above

is that it

is directly observable at time t and does not require any

assumption about expectations formation, such as rational expectations,

In order to be measured. This enables the researcher to examine a more

complete specification of the stochastic process of the own—commodity
real rate which involves how the variability of real rates evolves over
time.

Note that all returns, inflation, and interest rates in this paper

are continuously compounded, so that no second—order terms are
needed in equation (1).

Strictly speaking, F in equation (1) should be the price of a
forward contract rather than a futures contract. As Black (1976) has
pointed out, futures contracts are priced differently from forward

contracts. However, this difference should be minor relative to
movements of real interest rates. To the extent that prices of
forward contracts and futures contracts differ, this is just one
more reason why futures market data may not provide reliable information about the behavior of real interest rates.

To see how own—commodity real rates

in Cornell and French (1986), that if futures

markets existed for all commodities in the commodity bundle of the
aggregate price index, then the riskless real interest rate for the
aggregate economy, rr, can be written as a weighted average of all the
own—commodity real rates.

We can thus think of each own—commodity real rate as a measure

of the

aggregate real interest rate which Is subject to a measurement error of
the ex—ante relative price movement.

it is important to point out that there is a possibility that an
own—commodity real rate may contain no information about the real inter-

est rate. Suppose that a commodity is storable at zero cost and there
are no restrictions on selling this commodity short in the spot market.
Then this commodity will be subject to a cash-and—carry arbitrage condition in which the percentage difference between the forward rate and the

spot rate must equal the nominal interest rate. In this case, the own—
commodity real rate will necessarily be constant and equal to zero. For

commodities that are likely to be subject to cash—and-carry, own—
commodity real rates should not be very helpful for learning about the
behavior of real interest rates.
The real interest rite usually studied in the literature is the ex—
ante real return on a nominally rickless bond, which Is defined as,

the

Note that this real interest rate is not riskiess in real terms because
there is uncertainty about the inflation rate. It will thus differ from

the rickless real interest rate, rrt, by a risk premium. If this risk

The equation above thus tells us that the ax—post real rate is Just
equal to the real interest rate plus an error term which is the forecast
error of inflation.

Two disadvantages of using ax—post real Interest rate data to
examine the behavior of real interest rates are readily understandable

9

from the equation above. The presence of the t

forecast

error of infla-

tion term in ax—post real rates means that the researcher cannot
directly examine how the variability of the real interest rate changes

over time. Specifically, without knowledge about the variability of
inflation forecast errors, information about the variability of the real

Interest rate cannot be directly extracted from Information about the
variability of the ax—post real interest rate. The second disadvantage
stems from the fact noted In Mishkin (1981a) that the presence of the

inflation forecast error term implies that statistical tests using cx—
post real rates will have low statistical power. Equation

(3)

and our

discussion of own—commodity real rates Indicates, however, that they are

also subject to a similar disadvantage. Specifically, for both ax—post

real rates and own—commodity real rates there is a signal to noise
problem. For own—commodity real rates, the noise is the ax—ante relative

price movement, •,

while

inflation forecast error,

for ex—post real rates, the noise is the
If the ex—ante relative price movements,

are far greater in magnitude than movements in the real interest

rate, then examining own—commodity real rates is unlikely to help us

understand the behavior of real Interest rates. Furthermore, if the
variance of

greatly exceeds the variance of

then we are likely to

obtain better information about the behavior of real interest rates from

using ax—post real rate data than from own—commodity real rate data
constructed using futures market data.

Now that we understand the issues relating to the advantages and
disadvantages of using futures market data, we can go on to examine what
the data on own—commodity actually looks like.

III.

An Examination of the Own—Commodity Real Rate Data

Th. futures market data were obtained from the Center for the Study

of Futures Markets, Columbia Business School. The empirical analysis
requires a choice of non—financial commodities with equal spacing be-

tween contracts that also were traded for a substantial period both
before and after October 1979. Precious metals are not included in the

study because they are most likely to be subject to cash—and—carry
arbitrage which implies that they will contain little information about

real interest rates1 These criterion lead to the selection of five
commoditiesi live cattle (id *2), live hogs (id *4), soybeans (Id * 17),

frozen orange juice (Id * 12), and lumber (Id * 27). The sample period

for cattle, hogs and soybeans extends from January or February, 1967
until January or February 1986. Because earlier data was not available,

the sample period for orange juice extends from January 1968 until
January 1986, while that for lumber Is from January 1971 until January
1986,

These commodities have contracts maturing every two months, so that

the observation interval and holding period for the own—commodity real

rates is two months long. In calculating the logarithmic basis (i.e.,
the ex—ante rate of change in the commodity price), it is important to

make sure that the future and spot prices pertain to the exact same
commodity. Thus the futures price for the maturing contract is used as
the spot price for the commodity. For example, the logarithmic basis for
cattle (at an annual percentage rate) In February, 1967 is calculated ae

600 times the log of the April futures price at the closing on January
31, 1967 minus the log of the February futures price at the closing on

11

January 31,

1967. The nominal interest rate is computed as a con-

tinuously compounded percentage rate at an annual rate from beginning of

month prices of U.S. Treasury bills with two months to maturity (obtained from the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University
of Chicago). For the February, 1967 own—commodity real rate, the nominal

interest rate is 600 times the log of 100 minus the two—month bill price
at the closing on January 31, 1967.

Because the high variability of own commodity real rates is so

striking,

I did check outliers in the data for accuracy by comparing

the Center for Futures Markets data with published quotes in the
Wall Street Journal. In no case did I find a discrepancy between the

two data sources. Furthermore, although at first glance it might
appear as though the tremendous variability of an own—commodity real
rate implies an unexploited profit opportunity, closer inspection of
the market suggests that this is unlikely. For example, Bruce Hamilton has pointed out to me that the variability of the own—commodity
real rate for hogs (which is the highest of the five commodities) is
exactly what might be expected because hogs must be slaughtered at a
specific point in their lives in order to get a good price for their
meat.

As discussed in the methodology section, the ex—post aggregate real

interest rate differs from the ex—ante aggregate real interest rate by

the forecast error of inflation. On the other hand, the own—commodity
real rate differs from the ex—ante aggregate real rate by the amount of

the ex—ante relative price movements for the specific commodity. Thus
which method gives more accurate inference about the behavior of real
interest rates depends on whether the noise represented by the ex—ante
relative price movements Is greater than the noise attributable to the

forecast error of Inflation. Th. standard deviations of the own—
commodity real rates and the ax—post aggregate real rate does provide us

with information about the relative size of the noises. The upper bound
on the standard deviations of the forecast error of inflation equals the

The ex—ante real rate measure is a fitted value from ax—post real
rate regressions using the same breakpoints as Huizinga and Mishkin
(1986) with the two—month Treasury bill rate, two lags of the inflation rate and one lag of a supply shock variable as explanatory
variables. The observation interval and holding period is two months
long and the sources of the data are the same as in Huizinga and
Mishkin (1986).
12

This result follows from the fact that under rational expectations
the forecast error of inflation is uricarrelated with the ex—ante
aggregate real interest rate so that the variance of the ax—post
real rate equals the variance of the ex—ante real rate plus the
variance of the forecast error of inflation, Therefore, the maximum

possible standard deviation of the forecast error of inflation
occurs when the standard deviation of the ax—ante aggregate real
rate is zero and it Is equal to the standard deviation of the ax—
post real interest rate.

All of these standard deviation an, many times greater than th. upper
bound for the standard deviation of the forecast error of inflation of

rates is many times greater than the noise in the ex—post aggregate real

rate. Indeed, on average, the variation in the ex—ante relative price
movements seems to be on the order of at least 100 times greater than
the variation in the forecast errors of inflation. Therefore, futures

market data ii unlikely to provide as reliable information about the
behavior of the ex—ante aggregate real Interest

rat. a.

ex—post ag-

gregate real interest rate data does.

Since the upper bound for the standard deviation of the ex—ante
aggregate real rate equals the standard deviation of the ex—post aggregate real interest rate,14 3.2X, the calculations above can be inter-

preted in a slightly different way. Ex—ante relative price movements
(the noise) are on the order of over 100 times more variable than the

aggregate real interest rate (the signal). Since the signal to noise
ratio is apparently less than 1%, own—commodity real rates constructed

with futures market data are unlikely to be useful in examining the
behavior of aggregate real interest rates,

Another way of examining th. value of own—commodity real rate data
is to see whether this data confirms two widely accepted facts about the

behavior of aggregate real interest rates since October 1979. The first

fact is that aggregate real interest rose after October 1979 to levels

well above those in the mid to late 1970s. We see evidence of this in
Figure 6 where the measure of the ex—ante aggregate real rate averaged
—0.87. from the beginning of 1975 until October 1979, while after October

1979 it averaged 4.5X. The conclusion that ex—ante aggregate real inter-

est rates rose sharply after October 1979 is also supported by other
methods for measuring the ex—ante aggregate real interest rate, such as

those using survey measures of expected inflation. The second fact is
the increase in variability of ex—ante aggregate real rates after Oc—

14

As we have seen in footnote 12, the the variance of the ex—ante real
rate equals the variance of the ex—post real rate minus the variance
of the forecast error of inflation. The upper bound on the variance
of the ex—ante real rate is then reached when the variance of the
forecast error of inflation is assumed to be zero; i.e., when the
upper bound equals the variance of the ex—post real rate.

15

tobur 1979i From th. beginning of 1975 to October 1979, the standard
deviation of the ex—ante real rate measure In Figure 6 is .8%, and after

October 1979 it Ii 2.2%. These two facts about the behavior of ex—ante
real Interest rates seem to be accepted by almost all economists,15 and
yet they are not at all evident in the own—commodity real rate data.

In Figures 1 to 5, we see that, rather than rising after October
1979, there was some tendency for the own—commodity real rates to fall,

with three of the own—commodity real rates (hogs, soybeans and lumber)

falling into the negative range on average. Th. average values of the
own—commodity real rates for the five commodities in the 197! to October
1979 period and the post—October 1979 period are as followsi

Furthermore, the variability of the own—commodity real rates fall after
October 1979 rather than rise, as can be seen below.

iS

To my knowledge, there has not been any serious disagreement with
them.

The finding here is however consistent with the evidence in Parks
(1978) who suggests that there is a positive correlation between the
level of inflation and relative price variability. Since the inflation level fell after October 1979, relative price variability would
be expected to fall and this would be reflected in lower standard
deviations of own—commodity real rates.

Since the behavior of the own—commodity real rates before and after
October 1979 seems to be at odds with what most analysis suggests occurred for ex—ante aggregat. real rates, we have further evidence that
using futures markets to examine real interest rate behavior may not be
particularly illuminating.

Iv.

An Econometric Analysis of Own—Commodity Real Rate Behavior

One of the most striking economic phenomena in recent years is a
major shift in the stochastic process of real Interest rates in October
1979 which resulted in their sharp rise in the 19801 to levels unprece-

dented in the postwar period. Huizinga and Mlshkln (198à) document a
highly, statistically significant shift in the stochastic process in
October 1979,' but they cannot examine all the features of the stochas-

tic process because their use of ex—post real rate data does not allow

them to examine the variability of ex—ante real rates. Own—commodity

17

Additional evidence in Clarida and Friedman (1984) and Roley (1986)

is consistent with the Huizinga—Mishkin findlngsi these papers
document a shift in the stochastic process of nominal interest rates
when the monetary regime changes in October 1979.

17

real rate data does have the advantage that it allows direct statistical

tests on the variability of own—commodity real rates. Thus, even though

our results so far on the value of own—commodity real rate data for
examining aggregate real interest rates are negative, we should see If

econometric techniques that take advantage of the special features of
own—commodity real rate data provide useful results.

Here the behavior of own commodity real rates are examined with a
variant of the Huizinga—Mishkin methodology which is expanded to allow

for direct tests on the variability of own—commodity real rates. A
linear stochastic process of the own commodity real rate ii

defined to be orthogonal to X.

A key feature of the own—commodity real rate is that it is observable

and does not involve an additional

c

error term representing the

forecast error of inflation, as is the case for ex—post aggregate real
rate data.

The absence of the c error term allows the researcher to examine a

more general specification of the stochastic process in which the
variance of u changes over time. One convenient characterization of the

18

time—series process describing the variance of u is

with

the

Engi. (1982), where

Tests for a shift in th.

real rites at October 1979 involve a likelihood ratio test not only for

a change in the —parametari from befor, and ifter October 1979 (as In

Huizinga—Mishkin (1986)), but also for a chang. in the a—parameters
which describe the ARCH process. The tests for a shift in the stochastic

process thus examine not only whether the relationship of own—commodity

real rates to past economic variables changes, but also whether the

19

underlying variability of own—commodity real rates changes. A second
test for the most likely date of the shift in the stochastic process of
real rates involves a procedure outlined by Quandt (19Z8,1960), in which
the most likely date of the shift in the m and p parameters is estimated

by finding the breakpoint that produces the highest value of the
likelihood function. For each breakpoint, the following Quandt statistic
is calculatedi

where,

ln(L) • the maximized log—likelihood for the ARCH

the maximized log—likelihood for the ARCH

model assuming that particular breakpoint.

The most likely date of the break then occurs when the Quandt statistic
reaches its highest value.

The first step in the empirical analysis is specifying the stochas-

tic process of the own—commodity real rates specifically, the choice of
the X—variables and the order of the ARCH process. One desirable feature
of the ARCH model is that consistent estimates of the p—coefficients can
be obtained from a least squares regression under the assumption that

• 0 for all i. After using least squares to specify the X—variables,

then the order of the ARCH process can be chosen using Lagrange—
Multiplier tests described in Engle (1982)

in which the squared

residuals from the least squares regression are regressed on past lags
of the squared residuals,

20

Least squares estimates of the stochastic processes of the own—
commodity real rate revealed that a first—order autoregressive model
with seasonal dummies adequately fit the data for both the pre and post—

October 1979 sample periods.19 The correlogram of the residuals mdicated that the null hypothesis that the residuals are white noise could

riot be rejected, and in addition other economic variables such as the
supply shock variable used In Huizinga and Mlshkin (1986) were not found

to have statistically significant additional explanatory power. These
findings are consistent with those of Litterman and Weiss's (1985) study

of real interest rates who also found that other economic variables and

additional lags of real interest rates did not have significant additional explanatory power over a first—order autoregressive model.

The Lagrange—Multiplier (LM) tests for the order of the ARCH
process could not reject the hypothesis of no conditional heteroscedas—
ticity (i.e.,

• 0

for I

1) in the case of hogs, orange juice, and

lumber in both the pre and post—October 1979 sample periods. However,
the LM tests did reveal significant conditional heteroscedasticity in
the pre—October 1979 sample period for soybeans at lag 1 and for cattle
at lags 2 and 5.

20

Maximum likelihood estimates of the own—commodity real rate models

19

It should be noted that the additive seasonal model with seasonal
dummies outperforms the Box—Jenkins (1970) multiplIcative model.
When seasonal autoregressive parameters were included with the
seasonal dummies, the seasonal dummies remained statistically signiicant, while the seasonal autoregressive parameters were not
significant.

20

I also conducted Lagrange—Multiplier tests to see whether there was
any conditional heteroscedasticity related to seasonality as represented by seasonal dummies. Only in the case of soybeans did I find
any evidence of seasonal conditional heteroscedasticity. However,

allowing for seasonal conditional heterosedasticity in tests or
shifts in the stochastic process of the own—commodity soybean rate
led to similar conclusions to those found in the text.

21

using the specifications suggested by the results above can be found in

Tables 1 and 2.21 For both the pry—October 1979 sample periods, the
models show statistically significant serial correlation In the own—
commodity real rates, with the coefficient of the lagged own—rats as
high as

.90. Furthermore, except in the case of lumber, the coefficient

of the lagged own—rate does not appear to change appreciably from pre—

October 1979 to post October 1979. As expected from the Lagrange—
Multiplier tests, the variance of the error term in the models

for

cattle and soybeans displays statistically significant autoregressive

coefficients for the pre—October 1979 period, but these coefficients
decline appreciably in the post—October 1979 period.

Table 3 examines whether there was a major shift in the own—
commodity real rate processes after the change in the monetary policy

regime in October 1979. Because the linkage between monetary regime
shifts and changes in the seasonality of commodities is not a major
concern of monetary economics, Table 3 focuses only on likelihood ratio
test for shifts in the non—seasonal parameters of the own—commodity real
rate stochastic processes ——

i.e.,

the constant, the lagged own rate and

the u—parameters. (The results for tests of shifts in both the seasonal
dummies and the non—seasonal parameters can be found in Appendix I.) The

likelihood ratio tests in column 1 indicate that there is a statisti-

cally significant shift in the real rate process in October 1979 only
for soybeans and orange juice; there is no such shift for cattle, hogs

or lumber.

In order to see whether shifts in the own—rate processes in

October 1979 are unusual, we need to examine whether similar shifts

21

Note that equation (7) and (B) are estimated jointly in the maximum
likelihood estimation here so that the reported standard errors do
allow for conditional heteroscedasticity.

occur in both the pre and post-October 1979 sample periods. Likelihood

ratio tests for shifts in the middle of the pre—October 1979 and the
middle of the post—October 1979 sample periods are found in the second
and third rows of Table 3. Although, there are no significant shifts in
the own—rate processes in the post—October 1979 sample period, there is
strong evidence of instability in the real rate process for orange juice

in the pre—October 1979 period. The evidence in Table 3 is thus much

less clear—cut on the linkage between the monetary regime shift in
October 1979 and shifts In the stochastic process of own—commodity real
rates than ii the Hulzinga—Plishkin (1986) evidence using aggregate price
level data.

The evidence on dating the breakpoint in Table 4 also does not
provide clear—cut support for the proposition that own—commodity real
rates are linked to the monetary regime shift In October 1979. The rows

of the table show for each commodity the value of the Quandt statistic

at different breakpoints surrounding the October 1979 date.22 (Recall
that the most likely breakpoint occurs when the Quandt statistic reaches
a peak.) Not only is October 1979 not chosen as the most likely date for

the breakpoint for any of the commodities, but the dating of the most
likely breakpoint (marked by the box around the highest Quandt statistic) differs substantially from one commodity to the other.

The results with own—commodity real rate data thus do not reveal

the shift in the stochastic process of real interest rates which has
been documented elsewhere. This failure of own—commodity real rate data
to reveal this shift in the real rate process indicates that any advan—

Note that search for a second breakpoint is not conducted here as in

Huizinga and Mishkln (1986) because the likelihood ratio tests in
the third row of Table 3 did not reveal significant instability in
the own—rate processes in the post—October 1979 sample period.

Conclusions
Rarely in monetary/macro economics does empirical work pay sufficient attention to the quality of the data it is analyzing. This paper
is an attempt to be an exception since it asks whether a particular data

set is appropriate for answering an important set of questions. The
analysis here explores several pieces of evidence which provide informa-

tion on the usefulness of own—commodity real rates constructed from
futures market data for understanding the behavior of real interest
rates. The evidence can be summarized as

followsi

1. The noise in own—commodity real rates (the cx—
ante relative price movements) is so large rela-

tive to the signal (the aggregate real interest
rate) that own—commodity real rates are unlikely
to contain much information about aggregate real
interest rates.

23

Even though individual own—commodity real rates do not help us
understand the behavior of real interest rates, it is possible that
combining the information from the own—commodity real rates will
prove more successful. However, as can be seen from the evidence in
Appendix II, an optimal weighted average of the own—commodity real
rates also provides little information about the behavior of real

2. Data on awn—commodity real rates is not consistent with several widely

accepted

facts about the

behavior of aggregate real interest rates, indicating

that

own—commodity real rates can

provide misleading information about aggregate
real interest rates.
3.

Econometric analysis of own—commodity real rate
behavior fails to find a shift in the stochastic

process which has been documented for aggregate
real interest rates. The failure of own—commodity
real rate data to reveal a shift in the real rate

process indicates that any advantages of own—
commodity real rate data for econometric analysis

is overcome by the disadvantages stemming from
the fact that the noise in the data is orders of
magnitude larger than the signal.

Th. evidence in this paper thus casts serious doubt about some
conclusions in recent papers that make use of futures market data to

provide information about real interest rate behavior. Hamilton
(19S6) finds that during the contraction phas, of the Great Depres-

sion the futures market in several commodities did not reveal expected price deflation ——

in

other words, the own—commodity real rate

was not unusually high. He thus concludes that aggregate real

inter-

est rates were not high in the early years of the Depression and were

therefore not a major transmission mechanism of contractionary
monetary policy. The evidence in this paper suggests that this conclusion is unwarranted because own—commodity real rates do not reveal

25

much information about aggregate real Interest rates.24

Cornell and French (1996) study the response of own—commodity
real

rates to

money supply announcements and conclude that six— and

twelve—month aggregate real interest rates are positively correlated

with unexpected components of money supply announcements. The key
assumption in their analysis is that ex—ante relative price movements

for the commodities they study are independent of the money supply
announcement figure. Cornell and French provide no evidence that this

key aisumption is true. While nothing in this paper rules out their

assumption the evidence here does suggest that less than IX

of the

variation in the own—commodity real rate data reflects aggregate real

interest rates movements, while over 99V. Is due to ex-ante relative

price movements. Hence, their results probably reflect Information
about ex—ante relative price movements rather than about aaqreqate
real interest rates as they assume. This should make us very cautious
about

their findings.25
This

paper would have a happier endina if it concluded that

futures market data is useful for understandinc real interest rate
behavior. Instead, it indicates that a promisino research line exploiting futures market data for analysing real interest rates is not
so

24

promising. In order to learn more about real interest rates. we

It should be pointed out that much of Hamiltons discussion of the
8reat Depression period doei not depend on this conclusion and so

the

criticism here does not invalidate the basic points of

Hamilton's
25

very interesting paper.

Cornell and French (1986) find only weak evidence that the response
of real rate interest rates to money supply announcements shifts in
October 1979. This finding is consistent with the inability of the
econometric analysis of this paper to reveal a clear cut shift in

the stochastic processes of own-commodity real rates in October
1979. As argued here. both of these findings may be a reflection of
the problems with the own—commodity real rate data.

Appendix II

Does an Optimal Weighted Average of Own—Commodity Real Rates
Provide Information About the Behavior of Real Interest Rates?

Nelson's (1972) discussion of jointly optimal linear composite
predictions provides a methodology for examining this issue. Following Nelson, an optimal linear forecast of the aggregate real interest

rate using a own—commodity real rates can be obtained from the following regression equation

(Note that th. constant term is Included if the own—commodity real

rates are not unbiased predictors of the aggregate real interest

interest rate is unobservable, this equation cannot be estimated to

yield

the optimal weights, r3, However, the ex—post real interest

evidence using the weighted average data is no more successful in
finding a linkaqe between the own—commodity real rate behavior and

the monetary regime shift in October 1979 than ire the individual

commodity data.26 Thus, the answer to the question asked in this
appendix is not An optimal weighted average of own—commodity real
rates does not appear to provide substantial information about the
behavior of real interest rates.

Likelihood ratio tests for shifts in the non—seasonal parameters of
the ARCH model in the ore—October 1979 period and the post—October
1979 period also did not provide evidence that the parameters shift.
