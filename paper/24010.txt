Nowcasting the Local Economy: Using Yelp Data to Measure Economic Activity
Edward L. Glaeser, Hyunjin Kim, and Michael Luca
NBER Working Paper No. 24010
November 2017
JEL No. E17,O33,R11
ABSTRACT
Can new data sources from online platforms help to measure local economic activity?
Government datasets from agencies such as the U.S. Census Bureau provide the standard
measures of local economic activity at the local level. However, these statistics typically appear
only after multi-year lags, and the public-facing versions are aggregated to the county or ZIP
code level. In contrast, crowdsourced data from online platforms such as Yelp are often
contemporaneous and geographically finer than official government statistics. In this paper, we
present evidence that Yelp data can complement government surveys by measuring economic
activity in close to real time, at a granular level, and at almost any geographic scale. Changes in
the number of businesses and restaurants reviewed on Yelp can predict changes in the number of
overall establishments and restaurants in County Business Patterns. An algorithm using
contemporaneous and lagged Yelp data can explain 29.2 percent of the residual variance after
accounting for lagged CBP data, in a testing sample not used to generate the algorithm. The
algorithm is more accurate for denser, wealthier, and more educated ZIP codes.

1. Introduction

Public statistics on local economic activity, provided by the Census Bureau’s County
Business Patterns, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Federal Reserve System and state
agencies, provide invaluable guidance to local and national policy-makers. Whereas national
statistics, such as Bureau of Labor Statistics’ monthly job report are reported in a timely manner,
local data sets are often published only after long lags. They are also aggregated to coarse
geographic areas, which impose practical limitations on their value. For example, as of August
2017, the latest available County Business Patterns data was from 2015, aggregated to the zip code
level, and much of the zip code data is suppressed for confidentiality reasons. Similarly, the Bureau
of Economic Analysis’ metropolitan area statistics have limited value to the leaders of smaller
communities within a large metropolitan area.
Data from online platforms such as Yelp, Google, and LinkedIn raise the possibility of
enabling researchers and policy-makers to supplement official government statistics with crowdsourced data at the granular level, provided years before statistics become available. A growing
body of research has demonstrated the potential of digital exhaust to predict economic outcomes
of interest (e.g. Choi and Varian 2012, Cavallo 2012, Einav and Levin 2014, Kang et al. 2013, Wu
and Brynjolfsson 2015, Goel et al 2010, Guzman and Stern 2016). Online data sources also make
it possible to measure new outcomes that were never included in traditional data sources (Glaeser
et al. 2017).
In this paper, we explore the potential for crowdsourced data from Yelp to measure the
local economy. Relative to the existing literature on various forecasting activities, our key
contribution is to evaluate whether online data can forecast government statistics that provide
traditional measures of economic activity, at geographic scale. Previous related work has been less
focused on how predictions perform relative to traditional data sources, especially for core local
data sets, like County Business Patterns (Goel et al 2010). We particularly focus on whether Yelp
data predicts more accurately in some places than in others.
By the end of 2016, Yelp listed over 3.7 million businesses with 65.4 million recommended
reviews. 2 This data is available on a daily basis and with addresses for each business, raising the

Yelp algorithmically classifies reviews, flagging reviews that appear to be fake, biased, unhelpful, or posted by less
established users as “not recommended.” Recommended reviews represent about three quarters of all reviews, and

2

possibility of measuring economic activity day-by-day and block-by-block. At the same time, it is
a priori unclear whether crowdsourced data will accurately measure the local economy at scale,
since changes in the number of businesses reflect both changes in the economy and changes in the
popularity of a given platform. Moreover, to the extent that Yelp does have predictive power, it
is important to understand the conditions under which Yelp is an accurate guide to the local
economy.
To shed light on these questions, we test the ability of Yelp data to predict changes in the
number of active businesses as measured by the County Business Patterns. We find that changes
in the number of businesses and restaurants reviewed on Yelp can help to predict changes in the
number of overall establishments and restaurants in County Business Patterns, and that predictive
power increases with zip-code level population density, wealth, and education level.
In Section II, we discuss the data. We use the entire set of businesses and reviews on Yelp,
which we merged with CBP data on the number of businesses open in a given ZIP code and year.
We first assess the completeness of Yelp data relative to County Business Patterns, beginning with
the restaurant industry where Yelp has significant coverage. In 2015, CBP listed 542,029
restaurants in 24,790 ZIP codes, and Yelp listed 576,233 restaurants in 22,719 ZIP codes. Yelp
includes restaurants without paid employees that may be overlooked by the Census’ Business
Register. There are 4,355 ZIP codes with restaurants in County Business Patterns that do not have
any Yelp restaurants. Similarly, there are 2,284 ZIP codes with Yelp restaurants and no CBP
restaurants.
We find that regional variation in Yelp coverage is strongly associated with the underlying
variation in population density. There are more Yelp restaurants than CBP restaurants in New York
City. Rural areas like New Madison, Ohio have limited Yelp coverage. In 2015, 95% of the U.S.
population lived in ZIP codes in which Yelp counted at least 50% of the number of restaurants that
CBP recorded. This cross-sectional analysis suggests that Yelp data is likely to be more useful to
policy analyses in areas with higher population density.
In Section III, we turn to the predictive power of Yelp for overall ZIP code-level economies
across all industries, across all geographies. We look both at restaurants and, more importantly,

the remaining reviews are accessible from a link at the bottom of each business's page but do not factor into a
business's overall star rating or review count.

establishments across all industries.

Lagged and contemporaneous Yelp measures appear to

predict annual changes in CBP’s number of establishments, even when controlling for prior CBP
measures. We find similar results when restricting the analysis to the restaurant sector.
To assess the overall predictive power of Yelp, we use a random forest algorithm to predict
the growth in CBP establishments. We start by predicting the change in CBP establishments with
the two lags of changes in CBP establishments, as well as ZIP code and year fixed effects. We
then work with the residual quantity. We find that contemporaneous and lagged Yelp data can
generate an algorithm that is able to explain 21.4 percent of the variance of residual quantity using
an out-of-bag estimate in the training sample, which represents 75 percent of the data. In a testing
sample not used to generate the algorithm, our prediction is able to explain 29.2 percent of the
variance of this residual quantity.
We repeat this exercise using Yelp and CBP data at the restaurant level. In this case, the
basic Yelp prediction is able to explain 21.2 percent of variance out of the training sample, using
an out-of-bag estimate. The augmented Yelp prediction can explain 26.4 percent of the variance
in the testing sample.
In Section IV, we look at the conditions under which Yelp is most effective at predicting
local economic change. First, we examine the interaction between growth in Yelp and
characteristics of the locale, including population density and income. We find that Yelp has more
predictive power in denser, wealthier, and more educated areas. Second, we examine whether Yelp
is more predictive in some industries than others using a regression framework. We find that Yelp
is more predictive in retail, leisure, and hospitality industries, as well as professional and business
services industries. We then reproduce our random forest approach using geographic and industry
sub-groups. Overall, this suggests that Yelp can help to complement more traditional data sources,
especially in more urban areas and in industries with better coverage.
Our results highlight the potential for using Yelp data to complement CBP by nowcasting
– in other words, by shedding light on recent changes in the local economy that have not yet
appeared in official statistics due to long reporting lags. A second potential use of crowdsourced
data is to measure the economy at a more granular level than can be done in public facing
government statistics. For example, it has the potential to shed light on variation in economic
growth within a metropolitan area. In Section V, we turn to New York City to see how Yelp does

4

at measuring the micro-geography of a municipality. Yelp does seem capable of tracking the
evolution of neighborhoods even below the ZIP code level.
Section VI concludes that Yelp data can provide a useful complement to government
surveys by measuring economic activity in close to real time, at a granular level, and with data
such as prices and reputation that are not contained in government surveys. Yelp’s value for
nowcasting is greatest in higher density, income, and education areas and in the retail and
professional services industry. Data from online platforms such as Yelp are not substitutes for
official government statistics. To truly understand the local economy it would be better to have
timelier and geographically fine official data, but as long as that data doesn’t exist, Yelp data can
complement government statistics by providing data that are more up to date, granular, and broader
in metrics than would otherwise be available.

2. Data

County Business Patterns (CBP) is a program of the Census Bureau that publishes annual
statistics for businesses with paid employees within the United States, Puerto Rico, and Island
Areas. Statistics include the number of businesses, employment during the week of March 12, first
quarter payroll, and annual payroll, and are available by state, county, metropolitan area, ZIP code,
and congressional district levels. It has been published annually since 1964, and covers most North
American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industries excluding a few categories. 3 CBP’s
data are extracted from the Business Register, a database of all known single and multiestablishment employer companies maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau; the annual Company
Organization Survey; and various Census Bureau Programs including the Economic Census,
Annual Survey of Manufactures, and Current Business Surveys. County-level statistics for a given
year are available approximately 18 months later, and slightly later for ZIP code-level data.
As an online platform that publishes crowdsourced reviews about local businesses, Yelp
provides a quasi-real-time snapshot of retail businesses that are open (see Figure 1 for a screenshot
of the Yelp website). As of spring 2017, Yelp was operating in over 30 countries, with over 127

3

Excluded categories include crop and animal production; rail transportation; National Postal Service; pension,
health, welfare, and vacation funds; trusts, estates, and agency accounts; private households; and public
administration. CBP also excludes most establishments reporting government employees.

5

million reviews written and 84 million unique desktop visitors on a monthly average basis (Yelp
2017). Business listings on Yelp are continually sourced from Yelp’s internal team, user
submissions, business owner reports of their own business, and partner acquisitions, and then
checked by an internal data quality team. Businesses on Yelp span many categories beyond
restaurants, including shopping, home services, beauty, and fitness. Each business listing reports
various attributes to the extent that they are available, including location, business category, price
level, opening and closure dates, hours, and user ratings and reviews. The data begin in 2004 when
Yelp was founded, which enables U.S. business listings to be aggregated at the ZIP code, city,
county, state, and country level for any given time period post-2004.
For our analysis, we merge these two sources of data at the ZIP code level from 2004 to
2015. We create two data sets: one on the total number of businesses listed in a given ZIP code
and year, and another focusing on the total number of restaurants listed in a given ZIP code and
year. For the latter, we use the following NAICS codes to construct the CBP number of restaurants,
in order to pull as close as close a match as possible to Yelp’s restaurant category: 722511 (fullservice restaurants), 722513 (limited-service restaurants), 722514 (cafeterias, grill buffets, and
buffets), and 722515 (snack and nonalcoholic beverage bars) restaurants. 4
The resulting data set shows that in 2015, Yelp listed a total number of 1,436,442 U.S.
businesses across 25,820 unique ZIP codes, representing approximately 18.7% of CBP’s
7,663,938 listings across 38,748 ZIP codes. 5 In terms of restaurants, CBP listed 542,029
restaurants in 24,790 ZIP codes, and Yelp listed 576,233 restaurants in 22,719 ZIP codes, for an
overall Yelp coverage of 106.3%. Across the U.S., 33,120 ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)
were reported by the 2010 Census, and over 42,000 ZIP codes are currently reported to exist, some
of which encompass non-populated areas.
Yelp data also has limitations that may reduce its ability to provide a meaningful signal of
CBP measures. First, while CBP covers nearly all NAICS industries, Yelp focuses on local
businesses. Since retail is a small piece of the business landscape, the extent to which Yelp data
relates to the overall numbers of CBP businesses or growth rates in other industries depends on
the broader relationship between retail and the overall economy. Even a comparison to the
4

Some notable exclusions are 722330 (mobile food services), 722410 (drinking places), and all markets and
convenience stores.
5
These numbers exclude any businesses in Yelp that are missing a ZIP code, price range, or any recommended
reviews.

6

restaurant-only CBP data has challenges, as CBP’s industry classification is derived from the
Economic Census or other Census surveys. In contrast, Yelp’s classification is assigned through
user and business owner reports, as well as Yelp’s internal quality check. As a result, some
businesses may not be categorized equivalently across the two data sets (e.g. a bar that serves snack
food may be classified as a “drinking place” in CBP, while Yelp may classify it as both a bar and
a restaurant). Furthermore, Yelp includes restaurants with no employees, while CBP does not
count them. Second, the extent of Yelp coverage also depends on the number of Yelp users, which
has grown over time as the company has become more popular. In areas with thicker users bases,
one might expect business openings and closings to be more quickly reported by users, allowing
Yelp to maintain a fairly real-time snapshot of the local economy. However, in areas with low
adoption, businesses may take longer to be flagged as closed or open, adding noise to the true
number of businesses currently open in the economy. As Section 3 will further discuss, Figures 2
and 3 display a snapshot of Yelp coverage of CBP businesses and restaurants across the U.S. in
2015, showing that coastal and more highly populated areas are more likely to have reliable Yelp
data. Third, businesses with no reviews may receive less attention from users – and therefore may
be less likely to be flagged as open or marked as closed even after they close, since this relies on
user contributions.
To account for these limitations, we only count businesses as open if they have received at
least one recommended Yelp review. In the ZIP codes covered by both CBP and Yelp, Yelp’s
mean and median number of restaurants has steadily increased over the past ten years (see Figures
4 and 5). This increase reflects steadily increasing Yelp usage. We limit our sample to after 2009,
because the mean number of restaurants per ZIP code between CBP and Yelp becomes comparable
around 2009. The mean number of restaurants in Yelp actually surpassed the mean number of
restaurants in CBP in 2013, which may be explained by differences in accounting such as industry
category designations and Yelp counts of businesses with no employees. Finally, we limit our
analysis to ZIP codes with at least one business in CBP and Yelp in 2009, and examine a balanced
sample of ZIP codes from 2009 to 2015. Table 1 shows summary statistics of all variables in our
data set across this time period.
In the sections that follow, we use this data set to describe Yelp’s coverage over time and
geography in greater detail, as well as the findings of our analyses.

Comparing Restaurant Coverage on Yelp and County Business Patterns

We first compare Yelp and CBP restaurant numbers to paint a more detailed picture of
Yelp coverage across geography. In 2015 (the last year of CBP data available), 27,074 ZIP codes
out of 33,120 ZCTAs listed in the U.S. in 2010 had at least one restaurant in either CBP or Yelp. 6
CBP listed 542,029 restaurants in 24,790 ZIP codes, and Yelp listed 576,233 restaurants in 22,719
ZIP codes. There were 2,284 ZIP codes with at least one Yelp restaurant but no CBP restaurants,
and 4,355 ZIP codes with at least one CBP restaurant and no Yelp restaurants.
We focus on Yelp coverage ratios, which are defined as the ratio of Yelp restaurants to
CBP restaurants. Since we match the data by geography, not by establishment, there is no
guarantee that the same establishments are being counted in the two data sources. Nationwide, the
Yelp coverage ratio is 106.3%, meaning that Yelp captures more establishments, presumably
disproportionately smaller ones, than it misses.
Figure 3 shows a map of Yelp coverage across the U.S. in 2015, highlighting the high
coverage in coastal and high population density areas. Approximately, 95 percent of the population
in our sample live in ZIP codes where the number of Yelp restaurants is at least 50% of the number
of CBP restaurants, and over 50 percent of the population in our ZIP code sample live in ZIP codes
with more Yelp restaurants than CBP restaurants. (see Figure 6).
7

Yelp coverage of CBP restaurants is strongly correlated with population density. In the

1000 most sparsely populated ZIP codes covered by CBP, mean Yelp coverage is 88% (median
coverage = 67%), while in the 1000 densest ZIP codes, mean coverage is 126% (median coverage
= 123%). Figure 7 shows the relationship between Yelp coverage of CBP restaurants and
population density across all ZIP codes covered by CBP, plotting the average Yelp/CBP ratio for
each equal-sized bin of population density. The relationship is at first negative and then positive
for population density levels above 50 people per square mile.

We note that ZCTAs are only revised for the decennial census.
These ratios refer to the total counts of CBP and Yelp restaurants; we can make no claims about whether the two
sources are counting the same businesses.
7

8

The non-monotonicity may simply reflect a non-monotonicity in the share of restaurants
with no employees, which in turn reflects offsetting supply and demand side effects. In ZIP codes
with fewer than 50 people per square mile, Yelp tends to report one or two restaurants in many of
these areas where CBP reports none. Extremely low density levels imply limited restaurant
demand, which may only be able to support one or two small establishments. High density levels
generate robust demand for both large and small establishments, but higher density areas may also
have a disproportionately abundant supply of small-scale, often immigrant entrepreneurs. High
density levels may also have greater Yelp usage, which helps explain the upward sloping part of
the curve.
ZIP code 93634 in Lakeshore, California exemplifies low density America. The total
population is 33 people, over an area of 1,185 square miles that is mountainous (see Figure 8a).
Yelp lists two restaurants, while CBP lists zero. The two restaurants are associated with a resort
that may be counted as part of lodging establishments in CBP. ZIP Code 45346 in New Madison,
Ohio is near the threshold of 50 people per square mile. This large rural area includes 42 square
miles and a small village with 2,293 people (see Figure 8b). Both Yelp and CBP track exactly one
restaurant, which is a snack shop in the Yelp data. A very dense ZIP code like 10128 in Manhattan,
New York City’s Upper East Side, with a population of 60,453 in an area of 0.471 square miles
(see Figure 8c), lists 177 Yelp restaurants and 137 CBP restaurants, for a Yelp coverage ratio of
129%. While this neighborhood contains many large eating establishments, it also contains an
abundance of smaller eateries, including food trucks, that are unlikely to be included in County
Business Patterns.

III. Nowcasting CBP

We now evaluate the potential for Yelp data to provide informative measures of the local
economy by exploring its relationship with CBP measures, first using regression analysis and then
turning to a more flexible forecasting exercise.

Regression Analysis

9

Table 2 shows results from regressing changes in CBP business numbers on prior CBP
and Yelp measures. Column (1) regresses changes in CBP’s number of businesses in year t on two
lags of CBP. The addition of one CBP establishment in the previous year is associated with an
increase in 0.3 businesses in year t, showing that there is positive serial correlation in the growth
of businesses at the ZIP code level. The correlation is also strongly positive with a two-year lag
of CBP business openings. Together, the two lags of changes in CBP establishments explain 14.8%
of the variance (as measured by adjusted r-squared).
Column 2 of Table 2 regresses changes in CBP business numbers in year t on two lags of
CBP and the contemporaneous change in Yelp business numbers. Adding contemporaneous Yelp
business numbers increases the variance explained to 22.5%. A one-unit change in the number of
Yelp businesses in the same year is associated with increase in the number of CBP businesses of
six-tenths. This coefficient is fairly precisely estimated, so that with 99 percent confidence, a one
unit increase in the number of Yelp establishments is associated with between .55 and .66 CBP
establishments in the same year, holding two years of lagged CBP establishment growth constant.
The prediction of a purely accounting model of establishments is that the coefficient should
equal one, but there are at least two reasons why that prediction will fail. First, if there is
measurement in the Yelp variable, that will push the coefficient below one due to attenuation bias.
Second, Yelp doesn’t include many CBP establishments, especially in industries other than retail.
If growth in retail is associated with growth in other industries, then the coefficient could be greater
than one, which we term spillover bias and expect to be positive. The estimated coefficient of .61
presumably reflects a combination of attenuation and spillover bias, with spillover bias
dominating.
Columns 3 and 4 show that lagged Yelp data, as well as other Yelp variables including the
number of closures and reviews, are only mildly informative in explaining the variance of CBP
business number growth. Growth in CBP establishments is positively associated with one-year lag
in the growth in the number of Yelp establishments, and including that variable causes the
coefficient on contemporary establishment growth to drop to .44. Regression (4) also shows that
increases in the number of Yelp closings is negatively correlated with growth in the number of
CBP establishments, and that the number of Yelp reviews is not correlated with growth in the
number of CBP establishments. Some of these extra Yelp variables are statistically significant, but
they added little to overall explanatory power. The adjusted r-squared only rises from .225 to .229
10

between regression (2) and regression (4). The real improvement in predictive power comes from
the inclusion of contemporaneous Yelp openings, not from the more complex specification. This
suggests that simply looking at current changes in the number of Yelp establishments may be
enough for most local policy-makers who are interested in assessing the current economic path of
a neighborhood.
Table 3 replicates the above analysis for changes in the number of restaurants in a given
ZIP code and year. The first specification suggests that there is little serial correlation in CBP
restaurant openings, and consequently, past changes in CBP do little to predict current changes.
The second regression shows a strong correlation between changes in the number of CBP
restaurant openings and contemporaneous Yelp restaurant openings. The r-squared of .11 is lower
in this specification than in the comparable regression (2) in Table 2 (.23), but this is perhaps
unsurprisingly given the much lower baseline r-squared. The improvement in r-squared from
adding contemporaneous Yelp data in the restaurant predictions is larger both in absolute and
relative terms.
Perhaps more oddly, the coefficient on Yelp openings is .32, which is smaller for the
restaurant data than for overall data. We would perhaps expect the measurement bias problem to
be smaller for this industrial sub-group, and that would presumably lead us to expect a larger
coefficient in Table 3. The exclusion of other industries, however, reduces the scope for spillover
bias, which probably explains the lower coefficient. This shift implies that both attenuation and
spillover biases are likely to be large, which pushes against any structural interpretation of the
coefficient.
Regression (3) includes a one-year lag of Yelp openings, which also has a positive
coefficient. Including this lag causes the coefficient on lagged CBP openings to become even
more negative. One explanation for this shift could be that actual restaurant openings display mean
reversion, but restaurants appear in Yelp before they appear in County Business Patterns.
Consequently, last year’s growth in Yelp restaurants predicts this year’s growth in CBP
restaurants. Including this lag improves the r-squared to .123.
In regression (4), we include also our measure of closures in the Yelp data and the number
of Yelp reviews. The coefficients on both variables are statistically significant and both have the
expected signs. More Yelp closures are associated with less growth in CBP establishments. More
Yelp reviews imply more restaurant openings, perhaps because more reviews are associated with
11

more demand for restaurants. Including these extra variables improves the r-squared to .139.
These regressions suggest that there is more advantage in using a more complicated Yelp-based
model to assess the time series of restaurants than to assess the overall changes in the number of
establishments.
While these results suggest that Yelp data has the potential to serve as a useful complement
to official data sources, these regression analyses are hardly a comparison of best possible
predictors. To provide a more robust evaluation of the potential for Yelp data to provide
informative measures of the local economy, we now turn to out-of-sample forecasting of CBP
measures using more sophisticated prediction algorithms.

Forecasting with Random Forest Algorithms

We leverage random forest algorithms to evaluate whether Yelp measures can provide
gains in nowcasting CBP measures before the release of official statistics. We are interested in the
ability of Yelp to predict changes in overall CBP establishments and restaurants over and above
the prediction power generated by lagged CBP data. Consequently, we begin our prediction task
by regressing the change in CBP establishments on the two lags of changes in CBP establishments
and ZIP code and year fixed effects. We then work with the residual quantity. Given the two lags
of CBP, our sample spans years 2012 to 2015. We use a relatively simple first stage regression
because we have a limited number of years, and because modest increases in complexity add little
predictive power.
We assign the last year of our data set (2015) to the test set, which represents 25% of our
sample, and the rest to the training set. We then examine the ability of lagged and contemporaneous
Yelp data to predict residual changes in CBP number of establishments in a given year and ZIP
code. We include the following Yelp measures in the feature set: contemporaneous and lagged
changes in, and absolute count of, the total number of open, opened, and closed businesses,
aggregate review count, and the average rating of businesses, all in terms of total numbers and
broken down by lowest and highest price level, along with year and the total number of businesses
that closed within one year. The number of trees in the forest is set to 300. Using off-the-shelf
random forest algorithms on models with limited feature sets, our analyses represent basic
exercises to evaluate the usefulness of Yelp data, rather than to provide the most precise forecasts.
12

Table 4 shows prediction results. The first column shows our results for CBP
establishments overall. The second column shows the results for restaurants. We evaluate the
predictive power of our algorithm in two ways. Using the 2012-2014 data, we can use an “out-ofbag” estimate of the prediction accuracy. We also use the 2015 data as a distinct testing sample.
The first row shows that the algorithm has an r-squared of .29 for predicting the 2014-2015
CBP openings for all businesses and an r-squared of .26 for restaurants. Since the baseline data
had already orthogonalized with respect to year, this implies that the Yelp-based algorithm can
explain between one-quarter and one-third of the variation across ZIP code in the residualized CBP
data.
The second row shows the out-of-bag estimates of r-squared, based on the training data.
In this case, the r-squared is .21 for both data samples. The lower r-squared is not surprising given
that out-of-bag estimates can often understate the predictive power of models. Nonetheless, it is
useful to know that the fit of the model is not particular to anything about 2015.
There appears to be a wide range of predictive ability – but on average bounded within
approximately half a standard deviation for businesses, with 8.0 mean absolute error (MAE) and
3.9 median absolute error, compared to a mean of 3.4 and a standard deviation of 15.1. The mean
and median absolute errors for restaurants are substantially smaller than for businesses, at 1.7 and
1.1, respectively, but the mean and standard deviation for restaurant growth are also substantially
lower than for businesses, at .5 and 2.9, respectively.
Yelp’s predictive power is far from perfect, but it does provide significant improvement in
our knowledge about the path of local economies. Adding Yelp data can help marginally improve
predictions compared to using only prior CBP data.

IV. The Limits to Nowcasting by Geographic Area and Industry

We now examine where Yelp data is better or worse at predicting local economic change,
looking across geographic traits and industry categories. As discussed earlier, we believe that Yelp
is likely to be more accurate when population densities are higher and when Yelp use is more
frequent. We are less sure why Yelp should have more predictive power in some industries than
in others, but we still test for that possibility. We first use a regression framework to examine the
interaction between Yelp changes and local economic statistics on population density, median
13

household income, and education. We then run separate regression analyses by industry categories.
Finally, we reproduce our random forest approach for geographic and industrial sub-groups.

Table 5: Interactions with Area Attributes

Table 5 shows results from regressions where changes in Yelp’s open business numbers
are interacted with indicators for geographic characteristics. We use indicator variables that take
on a value of one if the area has greater than the median level of population density, education,
and income, and zero otherwise. Population density estimates are from the 2010 Census, while
measures of median household income and percent with a Bachelor’s degree are from the 2015
American Community Survey 5-year estimates. We present results just for total establishments,
and begin with the simple specification of regression (2) in Table 2.
In this first regression, we find that all three interactions terms are positive and statistically
significant. The interaction with high population density is .14. The interaction with high income
is .30. The interaction with high education is .09. Together, these interactions imply that the
coefficient on contemporaneous Yelp openings is .2 in a low density, low education and low
income locale and .73 in a high density, high education, high income ZIP code. This is an
extremely large shift in coefficient size, perhaps best explained by far greater usage of Yelp in
places with more density, education and income. If higher usage leads to more accuracy, this
should cause the attenuation bias to fall and the estimated coefficient to increase.
In the second regression, we also add lagged Yelp openings. In this case, the baseline
coefficient is negative, but again all three interactions are positive. Consequently, the estimated
coefficient on lagged Yelp openings is -.1 in low density, low income, low education locales, but
.24 in high density, high income, high education areas. Again, decreased attenuation bias is one
possible interpretation of this change. The third regression includes changes in Yelp closings and
the number of Yelp reviews.
These interactions suggest that the predictive power of Yelp is likely to be higher in places
with more density, education and income. However, it is not true that adding interactions
significantly improves the overall r-squared. There is also little increase in r-squared from adding
the lag of Yelp openings or the other Yelp variables, just as in Table 2. While contemporaneous
Yelp openings is the primary source of explanatory power, if policy-makers want to use Yelp
14

openings to predict changes in establishments, they should recognize that the mapping between
contemporaneous Yelp openings and CBP openings is different in different places.

Table 6: The Predictive Power of Yelp and Area Attributes

Table 5 examined how the coefficient on Yelp openings changed with area attributes.
Table 6 examines whether the predictive power of Yelp differs with the same attributes. To test
this hypothesis, we replicate Table 4 on different subsamples of the data. We split the data into
two groups based on first density, then income, and then education. The split is taken at the sample
median. For each split, we replicate our previous analysis using a random forest algorithm. Once
again, we omit the 2015 data in forming our algorithm and use that data to test the algorithm’s fit.
The first panel of Table 6 shows the split based on density. Our two primary measures of
goodness of fit are the r-squared for 2014-2015 CBP openings and the out-of-bag r-squared
estimated for the earlier data. In the high density sample, the r-squared for the out-of-sample data
is .24. In the low density sample, the r-squared is .06. The out-of-bag r-squared is .19 in the high
density sample and .03 in the low density sample. As the earlier interactions suggest, Yelp
openings have far more predictive power in high density ZIP codes than in low density ZIP codes.
One natural interpretation of this finding is that there is much more Yelp usage in higher density
areas, and consequently Yelp provides a more accurate picture of the local economy when density
is high.
The mean and median absolute errors are higher in high density ZIP codes than in low
density ZIP codes. Yet the mean and standard deviation of CBP establishment growth is also much
higher in such areas. Relative to the mean and standard deviation of CBP openings, the standard
errors are smaller in higher density locations. The mean and median absolute errors are 12.7 and
8.0 in the high density sample, compared to a mean CBP growth of 7.0 and standard deviation of
20.5. In low density locations, the mean and median absolute errors are 3.9 and 2.5, compared to
a mean CBP growth of .5 with a 6.5 standard deviation.
In the second panel, we split based on income. In the higher income sample, the r-squared
for 2014-2015 data is .33 and the out-of-bag r-squared is .26. In the lower income sample, the rsquared for the later data is .15 and the out-of-bag r-squared is .08. Once again, in higher income
areas where Yelp usage is more common, Yelp provides better predictions. In higher income areas,
15

the median absolute error (5.1) is lower than the mean CBP growth (6.1), compared to lower
income areas where the median absolute error at 3.5 is two and half times the mean CBP growth
of 1.4.
In the final panel, we split based on education and the results are again similar. The rsquared using the 2014-2015 data is .29 in the high education sample and .06 in the low education
sample. The out-of-bag r-squared is .23 in the high education sample and .03 in the low education
sample. Similar to the density split, the mean and median absolute errors are much higher in high
education ZIP codes than in low education ZIP codes, but smaller relative to the mean and standard
deviation of CBP establishment growth. The median absolute error in high education ZIP codes is
6.0, slightly lower than the mean CBP growth of 6.5 and approximately a third of the standard
deviation of CBP growth (19.1). In low education ZIP codes, the median absolute error is 3.0,
more than three times the mean CBP growth (.9) and approximately a third of the standard
deviation (10.2).
Table 6 shows that the predictive power of Yelp is much lower in lower education or lower
density locations. Yelp does a bit better in lower income areas. Yelp is more effective at predicting
the local economy when education, density and income is high. This suggests that using Yelp to
understand the local economy makes more sense in richer coastal cities, than in poorer places.
Yelp appears to complement income, education, and population density, perhaps because
higher density areas have more restaurant options. Consequently, Yelp is just a better source for
data in these areas and may be able to do more to improve local policy-making. This provides yet
another example of a setting where new technology favors areas with initial advantages.

Tables 7, 8 and 9: Cross Industry Variation

We now examine whether Yelp is more predictive in some industries than others. We
define industry categories loosely based on NAICS supersectors, creating six industry categories
described in Table 7. These sectors include “retail, leisure and hospitality,” which is the sector
that has the most overlap with Yelp coverage, “goods production,” “transportation and wholesale
trade.” “information and financial activities,” “professional and business services” and “public
services.”

16

We expect that Yelp’s predictive power will be higher in those industries where Yelp has
more coverage. Yelp covers local restaurants and services businesses, including hospitality, real
estate, home services, and automotive repair, as well as local landmarks including museums and
religious buildings. These industries mostly fall into two of our industry categories – retail, leisure,
and hospitality and professional and business services, with real estate and leasing falling into the
information and financial activities category.
For each industrial supersector, we regress changes in CBP business numbers in year t on
two lags of CBP in that industry group, contemporaneous and lagged changes in Yelp business
numbers, and changes in business closures and aggregate review counts in Yelp. We include the
CBP lags in each specific industry, but we do not try to distinguish Yelp listings by industry,
primarily because Yelp coverage in most of the industries is modest.
The first regression in Table 8 shows that the coefficients for the retail, leisure, and
hospitality industries are relatively large. A one-unit contemporaneous change in the number of
Yelp businesses is associated with a .21 change in the number of CBP businesses in that sector.
The coefficients on Yelp closings and total Yelp reviews are also significant. As in Table 3, lagged
CBP establishment openings are statistically insignificant in this sector.
The coefficient on contemporary Yelp openings for all of the other five industrial
supersectors can essentially be grouped into two sets. For professional and business services and
for information and finance, the coefficient is close to .1, and the other Yelp variables are strongly
significant as well. For the other three supersectors, the coefficient on the Yelp variables is much
smaller. The r-squared mirrors the coefficient sizes. In retail, leisure, and hospitality and
professional and business services categories, we can explain 8.5 to 10.2 percent of the variation
in CBP measures using lagged CBP and Yelp data, compared to 0.9 to 8.2 percent in the other
industry categories. These results suggest that Yelp is most likely to be useful for retail and
professional services industries and less likely for public services, goods manufacturing or
transportation and wholesale trade.
Finally, Table 9 replicates our random forest approach for each of the industrial
supersectors. Again, we follow the same two stage structure of first orthogonalizing with respect
to year, ZIP code, and past CBP changes. We again exclude the 2014-2015 CBP data from the
training data. We again calculate both the out-of-sample r-squared for that later year and we
calculate the out-of-bag r-squared based on earlier data.
17

The cross-industry pattern here is similar to the pattern seen in the regressions. Yelp has
the greatest predictive power for hospitality and leisure, professional and business services, and
information and finance. Among this group, however, Yelp data has the greatest ability to predict
movement in professional and business services, perhaps because that sector is less volatile than
restaurants. In this group, the r-squared for 2014-2015 data ranges from .11 for information and
finance to .17 for professional and business services. The out-of-bag r-squared values range from
.08 to .16.
Goods production and public services show less predictability from Yelp data. The 20142015 r-squared for both these two groups is approximately .07. The out-of-bag r-squared is less
than .01 for goods production and .03 for public services. Finally, Yelp shows little ability to
predict transportation and wholesale trade.
Our overall conclusion from this exercise is that Yelp does better at predicting overall
changes in the number of establishments than in predicting changes within any one industry. The
safest industries to focus on relatively fall either to hospitality or to business services. For
manufacturing and wholesale trade, Yelp doesn’t seem to offer much predictive power.

V. Identifying Neighborhood-Level Trends: Evidence from New York City

We now turn to a concrete example of how the data might be useful for policymakers,
focusing on Brooklyn and Manhattan in New York City (NYC) -- an area that has had high Yelp
penetration since Yelp’s early years. This section provides a small case study in how data from
Yelp might be used to quantify within city variation in economic activity, and go beyond the data
already contained in the census to demonstrate what might be learned by data that is contained
only in external datasets (in this case, Yelp).
Figure 11 shows a map of Yelp coverage across NYC in 2009, where Yelp coverage in
most of Brooklyn and Manhattan was over 75%. In 2015, New York City had a total of 19,673
CBP restaurants and 22,562 Yelp restaurants -- with over 60% of these in Manhattan and Brooklyn
(see Figure 12 for a map of Yelp coverage in 2015). There are no ZIP codes that CBP covers that
are not covered in Yelp (see Figure 13 for the distribution of Yelp/CBP ratios, average ratings,
and aggregate review counts across NYC ZIP codes).

18

We examine fast-growing ZIP codes in recent years in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Between
2012-2014, ZIP codes that show the highest growth in Yelp and CBP are comparable, in that all
ZIP codes with highest CBP growth also show high Yelp growth (see Table 10a). Table 10b
shows the fastest-growing ZIP codes sorted by Yelp growth rate, which suggests that Yelp appears
to find growth in areas that CBP doesn't show, which may be in part but not in full explained by
growth in Yelp reviews. Mapping ZIP codes to neighborhoods is challenging, since no official
definition of NYC neighborhoods exists and ZIP codes rarely match up cleanly with commonly
accepted neighborhood boundaries. We map ZIP codes to neighborhoods using ZCTA shapefiles
and Google Maps’ definitions of NYC neighborhoods. Between 2012 and 2014, CBP shows
highest growth in Williamsburg waterfront (11249), parts of Prospect Heights/Crown Heights/Fort
Greene/Clinton Hill (11238), Washington Heights (10040), eastern Bushwick (11237), and
Greenpoint (11222) -- where Yelp also shows high growth. Yelp’s five fastest-growing ZIP codes
also shows growth in Williamsburg and Bushwick, but also identifies western East New York and
southern Bushwick (11207), eastern East New York and part of Cypress Hills (11208), and
northern Brownsville and eastern Bedford-Stuyvesant (11233) -- all areas that from casual
empiricism experienced gentrification and growth in these years.
We now suppose that we are in 2016, when the latest CBP data available is from 2014.
Focusing on Manhattan and Brooklyn, which areas have been growing quickly between 2014 and
2016 that we wouldn’t have been able to see from CBP data in 2014? With only a few exceptions,
Yelp data from 2014 to 2016 shows before CBP 2015 is released whether growth is likely to slow
or rise (see Table 11). The five fastest-growing ZIP codes between 2014 and 2016 in Yelp include
areas that were already fast-growing in CBP 2014 like Williamsburg waterfront (11249) and
eastern Bushwick (11237), but also include Prospect Lefferts Gardens and Crown Heights (11225),
northern Brownsville and eastern Bedford Stuyvesant (11233), and eastern Crown Heights (11213)
-- all areas that showed little growth in CBP 2012-2014 but high growth in 2014-2015 once CBP
2015 was released.
Similarly, Yelp data points to ZIP codes that experience slowing growth that is eventually
reflected in CBP 2015. Between 2014 and 2016, the five areas with slowest (or negative) growth
are Harlem (10030), Sheepshead Bay and Gerritsen Beach (11229), Upper East Side (10021),
Midtown East (10022), and the intersection of Greenwich Village, East Village, Gramercy Park,
and Union Square (10003) -- only one of which showed negative growth in Yelp and CBP between
19

2012 and 2014 (10021). CBP 2015 shows a slowing of growth in at least three of these ZIP codes
(11229, 10022, 10003).
This example, in addition to our analyses, suggests how Yelp data can be useful for
policymakers in particular areas. In some ways, our exercise in this paper is a cross-validation to
evaluate the legitimacy of Yelp as a data source for policy.

Combining Yelp with Other Data

A tight geographic focus enables us to examine whether other variables available in Yelp
may create even more predictive power. One of these Yelp variables is the price level of local
businesses. Figure 14 shows the average price level of open restaurants by ZIP code across NYC
in 2015, pointing to areas that may have higher average prices across local businesses. Another
dimension that Yelp data provides is more granularity into what types of businesses are opening
and closing in a given ZIP code -- which we cannot glean through aggregate numbers of open
businesses as provided by official sources like CBP. For example, among the 10 ZIP codes
showing highest growth in Yelp in 2014-2016 (Table 11), we analyze the number of restaurants
closed in 2015 and 2016 over the number of open restaurants in 2014. We find that Brownsville,
Financial District, and Crown Heights show a low rate of closure (0.05 - 0.1), while Prospect
Lefferts Gardens / Crown Heights, Bushwick, and Bedford-Stuyvesant / Bushwick show almost
double that rate (0.22 - 0.29) -- highlighting different trajectories of growth. Furthermore, while
every ZIP code in this list of high growth showed at least a 10% growth in inexpensive restaurants,
Williamsburg and Prospect Lefferts Gardens / Crown Heights experienced the highest growth in
this category (41.8% and 31.4%), while only the Financial District and Williamsburg added more
expensive restaurants ($$$+ in Yelp, representing over $31 per person). Figures 15-18 show the
number of restaurant openings and closings by price level across NYC in 2015.
This snapshot of NYC openings and closings by price provides one example of how Yelp
data can offer additional data points not available in government data sets. In addition to these
dimensions, Yelp also provides data on consumer reviews and detailed business attributes
including hours, and services like wifi, reservations, and delivery, which can potentially allow for
new insight into local economies.

20

V. Conclusion

Recent years have witnessed ongoing discussions about how to update or replace the
national census across many countries. For example, the United Kingdom considered replacing
the census with administrative data as well as third-party data from search engines like Google
(Hope 2010, Sanghani 2013). One of the areas that the U.S. Census Bureau has been considering
in its new plan to pare $5.2 billion dollars from its cost of $20 billion for the decennial census is
to utilize administrative records and third-party data (U.S. Census Bureau 2015a, Mervis 2017).
Our analyses of one possible data source, Yelp, suggests that these new data sources can
be a useful complement to official government data. Yelp can help predict contemporaneous
changes in the local economy. It can also provide a snapshot of economic change at the local level.
It is a useful addition to the data tools that local policy-makers can access.
Yet our analysis also highlights the challenges with the idea of replacing the Census
altogether at any point in the near future. Government statistical agencies invest heavily in
developing relatively complete coverage, for a wide set of metrics. The variation in coverage
inherent in data from online platforms make it difficult to replace the role of providing official
statistics that government data sources play.
Ultimately, data from platforms like Yelp –combined with official government statistics –
can provide valuable complementary datasets that will ultimately allow for more timely and
granular forecasts and policy analyses, with a wider set of variables and more complete view of
the local economy.

All analyses predict residual variance in the change in CBP establishments after regressing two lags of changes in
CBP establishments with ZIP code and year fixed effects. Features include year and the change in and absolute number
of total open, opened, and closed businesses as recorded by Yelp, aggregate review count, and average rating, and
broken down by lowest and highest business price level. The sample covers the time period 2012-2015, and all
observations for 2015 have been assigned to the test set, and the rest to training. The number of trees in the forest is
set to 300. The number of observations, means and standard deviations of CBP Growth are reported using the full set
of observations across both training and test sets.
