ABSTRACT
This paper studies the life-cycle dynamics of exporters and multinational enterprises (MNEs).
Using rich firm-level data, we document a comprehensive set of facts on entry, exit, and growth
of new exporters and new MNEs. Guided by these facts, we build a model based on the standard
proximity-concentration trade-off extended to incorporate time-varying firm productivity and
sunk costs of MNE entry. The calibrated version of the model goes far in matching crosssectional and dynamic moments of the data on exporters and MNEs. We show that including the
choice to become an MNE affects the predicted export dynamics after trade liberalization. The
different dynamics in a model with and without MNEs hinge on the right truncation of fastgrowing exporters induced by the inclusion of the MNE choice.

Introduction

Exporters’ life-cycle dynamics are important to understand the long-term and short-term
effects of economic shocks and trade policy changes. In consequence, they have been
extensively studied. However, exporting is only one possibility for firms to serve a foreign
market. Firms may also choose to become multinational enterprises (henceforth, MNEs).
Despite the overwhelming importance of these firms in the data, we know comparatively
little about the life-cycle dynamics of MNEs and their possible interaction with exporter
dynamics.1
This paper studies the life-cycle dynamics of exporters and MNEs. Using rich firm-level
data, we first provide a comprehensive set of facts on the life-cycle dynamics of new
exporters and new MNEs. We exploit data on domestic firms, exporters, and MNEs from
France and Norway and complement them with data on MNEs from Germany. First,
new exporters in a foreign market have two to three times higher exit rates than new
affiliates of MNEs in the same market. Second, average sales growth is similar for new
exporters and new MNEs. However, export growth profiles of exporters that switch to
serving the market as MNEs are steeper than those of exporters that do not switch to
MNE status. Finally, exit rates of exporters at age one exhibit gravity—they are strongly
correlated negatively with foreign market size and positively with distance—whereas
those of young MNE affiliates are uncorrelated with these foreign country characteristics.
In contrast, entry rates do not present stark differences in their gravity patterns between
the two groups. Our findings are strikingly very similar across the three economies under
study, despite their different size and structure.
Guided by the facts, we develop a dynamic model of trade and foreign direct investment
(FDI) based on the static model of the proximity-concentration trade-off in Helpman et al.
(2004, henceforth, HMY). We introduce dynamics into the model by assuming that firm
productivity evolves according to a Markov process and that MNE activities face a sunk
entry cost. The model preserves the ranking of the export and MNE choice from the static
model: The most productive firms become MNEs; firms with intermediate productivity
levels become exporters; and the least productive firms serve only their home market.
The sunk costs of MNE activities lead to a band of inaction, a range of productivity levels
where existing MNEs do not exit a market, but non-MNEs with the same productivity do
not enter. We show that our model is rich enough to qualitatively capture the facts we
document.
1

MNE affiliates’ global sales are twice as large as global exports, and they account for disproportionally
large shares of aggregate output and employment in many countries (Antrás and Yeaple, 2014).

1

In the calibrated version of the model, we incorporate sunk export costs, as in the dynamic
model of exporting in Roberts and Tybout (1997), and assume that fixed and sunk costs
for both MNE and export activities are heterogenous at the firm-destination level. We
evaluate this quantitative version of the model in which Helpman et al. (2004) is coupled
with dynamics features of Roberts and Tybout (1997). Although we do not target the
life-cycle exit and growth profiles of exporters and MNEs, the calibrated model captures
quite well the patterns observed in the data.
Finally, we evaluate the predictions of our calibrated model with both exporters and
MNEs regarding life-cycle and aggregate dynamics after a hypothetical trade-liberalization
episode. We compare the predictions of our model with both exporters and MNEs to a
calibrated version of the model with only exporters. Enriching the canonical dynamic
model of trade to include MNEs—a first-order feature of the data—has consequences for
the life-cycle and aggregate dynamic behavior of exporters. One source of the different
responses of exporters between the two models hinges on the right truncation of fastgrowing exporters induced by the inclusion of the MNE choice. Without the MNE choice,
the most productive firms are exporters, as in the static model in Melitz (2003); with the
MNE choice, the most productive firms become MNEs, as in HMY. In a dynamic setup,
including the MNE choice not only truncates the exporters’ distribution of productivity
levels, but also induces a truncation to-the-right of the distribution of growth rates. The
fastest-growing exporters stop exporting and become MNEs when that option is allowed,
while the slowest-growing exporters remain exporters. Those exporters with the highest
productivity growth do not contribute to the average growth rate of exporters in the
model with MNEs—because they change status—but they do so in the model where the
MNE option is not included.2
Our paper contributes to several strands of literature. First, we contribute to the small, but
growing, literature that studies the joint behavior of exporters and MNEs using dynamic
models. Ramondo et al. (2013), Fillat and Garetto (2015), and Conconi et al. (2016), among
others, document and study different implications of the proximity-concentration tradeoff in dynamic setups. We present new evidence and study implications related to the
joint life-cycle behavior of exporters and MNEs.3
2

This mechanism hinges on the assumption that exporters that become MNE abandon exports to serve
a foreign market. We find that exports relative to total sales in a foreign destination decrease sharply after
MNE entry, consistent with the evidence documented by Belderbos and Sleuwaegen (1998), Bloningen
(2001), and Head and Ries (2001), which use detailed firm- and product-level data.
3
Ramondo et al. (2013) include aggregate uncertainty into a two-period model of trade and FDI to
analyze how the properties of the international business cycle affect the choice of the entry mode into
foreign markets. Fillat and Garetto (2015) include aggregate uncertainty and sunk entry cost to study the
consequences for asset pricing. Conconi et al. (2016) include a learning mechanism to explain that most
firms enter foreign markets as exporters before opening an affiliate there. Early work by Rob and Vettas

2

Second, we complement the extensive literature that studies exporters’ dynamics. Early
work by Baldwin (1989), Baldwin and Krugman (1989), and Dixit (1989), followed by
Roberts and Tybout (1997), Ghironi and Melitz (2005), Das et al. (2007), Alessandria and
Choi (2007), and Impullitti et al. (2013), point to the importance of the hysteresis created
by sunk investments for understanding the effects of temporary and permanent shocks
on aggregate trade flows and exchange rate movements. Our model combines elements
of this rich dynamic literature on exporters with the canonical model of trade and FDI in
Helpman et al. (2004).
Our paper is also closely related to Ruhl and Willis (2017) who document a set of lifecycle dynamics facts for Colombian exporters. We document a similar (sub-)set of facts
for new French and Norwegian exporters, but also include life-cycle facts for MNEs. We
find, as they do, that matching the observed patterns of survival and growth of new
exporters requires very low sunk export costs, but this is not the case for MNEs. Whereas
they include demand-side frictions in the model to match the observed exit and growth
patterns, we include MNEs, a first-order feature of the data. We evaluate how far the
model goes in matching the data and whether the presence of MNEs changes the dynamic
behavior of exporters after a hypothetical trade-liberalization episode.4
The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes the data; Section 3 documents the
facts; Section 4 describes the model; Section 5 presents the calibration; Section 6 presents
the counterfactual exercises; and Section 7 concludes.

Data

Our empirical analysis is based on rich firm-level panel data sets from France, Norway,
and Germany. The French and the Norwegian data contain information on domestic
firms, exporters, and MNEs in varying levels of detail. In contrast, the German data
(2003) features demand uncertainty together with capacity constraints to study the mechanism behind the
choice of firms to simultaneously export to and maintain affiliates in the same market.
4
The literature on the life-cycle of domestic firms (summarized by Haltiwanger et al., 2013) and
exporters find that models with a AR(1) firm-level productivity process, as in Hopenhayn (1992), deliver
new firms that grow too large too quickly. Both literatures have resorted to demand frictions to slow down
firm growth (see Foster et al. (2016) for domestic firms). In relation to exporters’ growth driven by demand
factors, papers such as Albornoz et al. (2012), Eaton et al. (2014), and Morales et al. (2017), focus on the
dynamics of trade associated with learning. Arkolakis (2016) includes the cost of building a customer base
in a dynamic model of trade. Fitzgerald et al. (2017) evaluate the importance of demand-learning firm
growth versus customer-based firm growth to explain the life-cycle dynamics of firm export quantities
and export prices. Araujo et al. (2016) document that in markets with better contracting institutions new
exporters start bigger but grow slower (conditional on survival). They propose a framework in which
imperfect contract enforcement, together with imperfect information (and previous export experience in
other foreign markets) interact to match the observed pattern of exporter growth and survival.

contain extremely detailed information on the foreign affiliates of German MNEs, but do
not provide any information on exporters and domestic firms. Our analysis exploits the
strengths of each of the three data sources, all of which cover a period of more than ten
years.
France. The data span the years 1999-2011 and combine information from several sources.
Information on a firm’s domestic sales is from FICUS (1999-2007) and FARE (2008-2011);
the export data are from the French customs; information on ownership links between
firms in France and between firms in France and abroad are from LiFi; and information
on foreign affiliate sales is from OFATs (2007, 2009-2011). We restrict the sample to firms
that are subject to the BRN-taxation regime and, for some of the analysis, to the sub-period
1999-2007.5
The data contain information on each firm’s domestic sales and export sales by destination,
as well as the location of foreign affiliates of French MNEs. Information on foreign affiliate
sales is available only for a subset of large MNEs and for some (non-consecutive) years.6
While affiliate sales are recorded annually, exports are recorded monthly. Following
Kleinert et al. (2015), we consolidate the information on domestic activities, exports and
foreign affiliates to the level of the French group (i.e., if firms A and B belong to firm C,
we consolidate all three firms). We keep a consolidated firm in the sample if at least one
of its domestic members is active in the manufacturing sector in at least one year.7 For
independent firms, we focus on those that operate in the manufacturing sector in at least
one year. Our sample contains only firms headquartered in France and excludes French
affiliates of foreign MNEs.
We consider MNE-country pairs and exporter-country pairs with multiple entry and
exit over the sample period.8 We restrict our attention to majority-owned affiliates of
French MNEs, which account for around 80 percent of all affiliates of French MNEs. We
aggregate both exports and FDI at the parent firm-foreign destination-year level. We end
up with a sample of 963,375 firm-year observations. The upper panel of Table E.1 shows
that 1.6 percent of firms in our sample are MNEs and 28.7 percent are non-MNE exporters.
5

The FICUS/FARE databases provide balance sheet data on virtually all French firms. The principal
data source is firms’ tax statements. The BRN regime applies to larger firms. We conducted our analysis
also including all firms. As small firms rarely export or conduct FDI, results are very similar. The period
restriction is made in order to avoid structural breaks in the time series, as both the industry classification
and the definition of the domestic sales variable changed in 2008.
6
OFATS is a survey of French MNEs with affiliates outside of the European Union. The sample is biased
towards large MNEs, as a comparison of domestic sales for MNEs in OFATs and the other sources reveals.
7
This consolidation implies that wholesale firms in France may be part of our sample, which is
important because large French groups often channel exports through wholesale affiliates.
8
Restricting the sample to MNE-country and exporter-country pairs with a single entry and exit over
the sample period yields very similar results.

4

French MNEs account for almost 60 percent of employment in our sample, while nonMNE exporters account for more than 30 percent. The median (mean) French MNE
operates in two (five) markets, with a handful of MNEs serving more than 81 markets,
while the median (mean) exporter serves four (ten) markets, with some exporters serving
more than 178 markets (top-coded to preserve confidentiality).
Norway. The data, which span the years 1996-2006, include information on each firm’s
domestic sales, as well as export and foreign affiliate sales by destination country. The
data nest balance sheet information on firms in the Norwegian manufacturing sector from
Statistics Norway’s Capital Database; information on exporters from customs declarations;
and data on firms’ foreign operations from the Directorate of Taxes’ Foreign Company
Report. The coverage is comprehensive: All foreign affiliates of Norwegian firms in the
manufacturing sector, as well as 90 percent of Norwegian manufacturing revenues, are
included; firms in the oil sector are excluded.
We consider MNE-country pairs and exporter-country pairs with multiple entry and
exit over the sample period. We include both majority- and minority-owned foreign
affiliates of Norwegian parents and adjust the affiliate sales by the parent’s ownership
share.9 Our sample consists of 89,018 firm-year observations. As the lower panel of
Table E.1 shows, only 1.5 percent of Norwegian firms have affiliates abroad, and 36.4
percent are non-MNE exporters. Norwegian MNEs represent more than 13 percent of
total manufacturing employment in Norway, while exporters represent 63 percent. The
median (mean) Norwegian MNE operates in two (four) markets, with a maximum at 37
markets, while the median (mean) exporter serves three (seven) markets, with a maximum
of 122 markets.
Germany. The data, which span the years 1999-2011, contain detailed balance sheet
information about foreign affiliates of German MNEs. The main data source is the Microdatabase Direct investment (MiDi, see Schild and Walter, 2015). Information about parent
firms is limited; for instance, it is not possible to distinguish between domestic and export
sales of the parent.
We consolidate the information on direct and indirect ownership shares and restrict our
attention to majority-owned affiliates, which represent 95 percent of foreign affiliates
of German MNEs, and affiliates whose parent operates in the manufacturing sector, or
whose parent is a holding company belonging to a corporate group in the manufacturing
sector, in at least one year.10 We consolidate affiliates at the parent firm-foreign destination9

A 20 percent ownership threshold, not ten percent, is used to distinguish direct from portfolio
investment. The ownership shares considered for Norway are lower than the ones for France (20 versus 50
percent) in order to gain observations.

percent of German firms have affiliates abroad, but they account for 27 percent of total
sales in Germany (Buch et al., 2005). The median (mean) German MNE operates in one
(three) country(ies), with some parents operating in more than 27 markets (top-coded to
preserve confidentiality).

Facts on the life-cycle dynamics of exporters and MNEs

We document three novel facts about the life-cycle dynamics of MNEs and exporters.
First, we show life-cycle patterns of exit rates. Second, we present evidence on life-cycle
growth. Third, we document the relation between exit and entry rates across destination
markets and characteristics of those markets. Taken together, these facts are informative
about the features to be included in a dynamic model of exports and FDI— we explain
this connection in more detail below.
We study the behavior of new firms that start exporting to—or open an affiliate in—
a foreign country. We focus on the firm’s main mode of international operation and
distinguish between non-MNE exporters and MNEs. That is, only firms that are not
MNEs are considered exporters to a foreign destination, while firms with foreign operations
in a market are considered MNEs whether they export or not contemporaneously to the
same foreign destination. This distinction is motivated by the observation that FDI is
the dominant mode of serving the foreign market after MNE entry. Appendix Figure D.1
shows that the average export-to-foreign sales ratio decreases to around ten percent when
a firm opens an affiliate in a market, and that around ten percent of MNEs with exports
to that market before MNE entry completely discontinue exporting once they switch to
FDI.
Our facts are based on observations at the firm-destination-year level. For expositional
purposes, in the body of the paper, we present figures that show averages across the
destinations, weighted by each destination’s share of export (MNE) firms. Appendix
Table E.2 contains the results of Ordinary-Least- Squares (OLS) regressions that include a
battery of fixed effects and additional controls.
requirements change over time. We adjust the sample to unify thresholds: We include only affiliates with
either a participation of ten percent and revenues of at least ten million DM (Euro equivalent), or with
participation of at least 50 percent and revenues of at least three million Euro. We consolidate ownership
shares and restrict the sample to majority-owned affiliates only after unifying the reporting threshold.

3.1

Exit rates

We first study the exit patterns of new exporters and new MNEs. We focus on exit from
the current mode of international operation and a foreign country.
Figure 1 plots the exit rates of exporters and MNEs at the firm-destination level by age.
Exit rates are calculated as the number of MNEs (exporters) that exit a given destination
relative to the number of active MNEs (exporters) in that destination at each age. Age
refers to the number of years after entry in a given market-mode, with age in the entry
year equal to zero. The figure presents averages across all firm-destination pairs.
On average, MNEs in a foreign market have between one third and one half of the exit
rates of exporters in the same foreign country in their first year of life. For both modes
of internationalization, exit rates are declining with age, though more drastically for
exporters. It is remarkable that results are qualitatively and quantitatively similar between
France and Norway.11
A formal test confirms that French exporters are around 15 percentage points more likely
to exit than foreign affiliates of French MNEs in the first two years after entry, but the
difference disappears later in life. For Norway, the difference in exit rates between exporters
11
Eaton et al. (2008) document similar exit rates for new Colombian exporters at the firm-destination
level. In unreported evidence, we find that the exit patterns of new MNEs from Germany are also
remarkably similar to the patterns found for French and Norwegian MNEs.

for one or more years before opening an affiliate there. Observations are at the firm-destination-year level.
We show averages across destinations weighted by each destination’s share of MNE firms.

and MNEs is 30 percentage points at entry, but, after two years, the difference is not
statistically different from zero. This finding is summarized in Appendix Figure D.2.
It is reasonable to conjecture that having experienced a destination market as an exporter
before entering with an MNE affiliate has an effect on the chances of survival in that
market. We explore this evidence in Figure 2. We define "experienced MNE" an MNE
that exported to a given destination market in any year before opening a foreign affiliate
there.12 Experienced MNEs have an almost 10-percentage point lower exit rate, on average,
in the first year after entry than new affiliates without export experience. However, this
advantage disappears later in life (see also Appendix Figure D.3).
We conclude that:
Fact 1. New MNEs in a foreign destination have lower exit rates than new exporters in
that destination. MNEs with previous export experience in a market have lower exit rates
at entry than MNEs without that experience.
The large difference between exit rates of exporters and MNEs suggests the presence of
sunk costs of MNEs that are much larger than sunk costs of exporting. Additionally,
the co-existence of experienced and non-experienced MNEs supports a HMY-type model
with an AR(1) process for firm productivity.
Robustness. One may be concerned that the differences in exit rates documented in
12

Experienced MNEs represent almost 60 percent of new MNEs for France (47 percent for Norway).

Figure 1 are not due to differences between the two modes of internationalization, but
that they are artifacts of definitions of age and exit. Firms may switch between modes
so that exporters become MNEs, and MNEs become exporters, for example. To exclude
such patterns from driving our results, we present two robustness results using the French
data. First, we recompute age as the number of years that the firm is active in a market,
regardless of its international mode of operation; that is, we compute market-specific,
rather than mode-market specific, age. Second, we redefine exit as complete exit from the
market rather than as exit from either exporting or MNE activities in a market. Baseline
results still hold, as columns 3 and 4 in Appendix Table E.2 show. Additionally, one may
be concerned that the entry mode of FDI plays a role: If MNEs enter a market through
Merger and Acquisition (M&A), they take over pre-existing domestic firms, whereas
Greenfield affiliates are, by definition, brand-new firms. Using the data from Germany,
Appendix Figure D.5a shows that there is no difference in exit rates between the two
modes of entry of foreign affiliates of German MNEs.13

3.2

Sales growth

Figure 3 shows the sales growth of exporters and MNE affiliates by age. We focus on firms
that survive for at least four years in a mode-market and demean the firm-destination
observations by industry, year, and destination fixed effects. We normalize sales with
respect to one-year after entry because the entry year may be contaminated, particularly
for exporters, by the so-called "partial-year effects"—artificially high first-year growth
rates due to firms that start operations in the middle of the calendar year (see Bernard
et al., 2017). Columns 5 and 6 in Appendix Table E.2 show the OLS results.
Figure 3 shows that foreign sales grow at similar rates for French exporters, Norwegian
exporters, and Norwegian MNEs, conditional on surviving for at least four years in the
market. Growth rates are markedly different only between age zero and age one, but as
outlined, this difference is likely attributable to partial-year effects.14
Lumping together exporters that eventually become MNE with the ones that never do
may mask substantial heterogeneity. Figure 4 shows that, in the French data, the group
13

In unreported results for France, we find that our baseline results are robust to: splitting the sample into
European Single Market (ESM) and non-ESM countries to address concerns about the different reporting
thresholds for exports to EU and non-EU members; using the unconsolidated rather than the consolidated
data; splitting the sample into the 1999-2005 and 2006-2011 periods; including cohort, rather than year,
fixed effects; and correcting for partial-year effects. Additionally, results at the firm level are very similar to
results at the firm-destination level.
14
Unreported evidence for Germany shows that sales profiles of German MNEs are quite similar to the
ones of Norwegian MNEs.

of exporters that switch to FDI to serve a given market ("ever-MNE" exporters) clearly
grow faster, in terms of exports, in the years previous to MNE entry, than the exporters
that never become MNE ("never-MNE" exporters). In the Norwegian data, the difference
is less marked, but the number of observations also decreases substantially.
We conclude that:
Fact 2. Average life-cycle sales growth is similar for exporters and MNEs. However, everMNE exporters grow, on average, much faster before MNE entry than do never-MNE
exporters.
The similarity of export and affiliate sales growth suggests that productivity evolves in a
similar way for exporters, parents and affiliates of MNEs. The higher export sales growth
of ever-MNEs than never-MNEs supports a strong role for self-selection of firms into the
different modes of internationalization, as in HMY.
Robustness. One may be concerned that normalizing sales growth by the year after
entry is not sufficient to adequately account for partial-year effects. As the French data
contain monthly export sales, we can correct for partial-year effects by calculating 12month growth rates (as also done by Bernard et al. 2017). A comparison of columns 5 and

Notes: Log of firm-destination export sales with respect to firm-destination export sales in the year after export
entry, for firms with five or more years in the market as exporters. Observations are at the firm-destinationyear level. We show averages across destinations weighted by each destination’s share of export firms. Log of
sales are first demeaned by industry, year, and destination fixed effects. Never-MNE exporters are exporters
that, in our sample period, do not change to MNE status. Ever-MNE exporters are exporters that become
MNEs after export entry. Exports for ever-MNE exporters are computed for the years before MNE entry, for
exporters that enter MNE status after exporting for four years into a given market.

7 in Appendix Table E.2 confirms that the entry year does seem contaminated by these
effects: Growth at age one is much higher for the calendar-year data than for the adjusted
data; for subsequent ages, growth rates are quite similar, which supports the age-one
normalization in Figure 3.
To document the selection induced by non-random survival, Appendix Figure D.4 shows
growth profiles by tenure in the market. As expected, firms that survive longer grow
faster. The differences are less pronounced for MNEs, but for all tenure lengths, exports
from age one onwards grow at a similar rates as MNE sales.
Finally, one may be rightly concerned that sales growth rates of new MNEs differ between
new MNE affiliates that enter the market through M&A versus Greenfield FDI. One may
expect that, as brand-new firms, affiliates created through Greenfield FDI grow faster than
affiliates created through M&As, which are older.15 Using the German data, Appendix
Figure D.5b shows that, as expected, MNEs that enter through M&A grow less than MNEs
that enter a market with a Greenfield project. Nonetheless, the differences are not large if
one disregards the entry year, again supporting our normalization choice in Figure 3.
15

Part of the higher growth rate may be due to partial-year-effects for MNEs because some affiliates may
not start operating in January, but later in the year.

3.3

Entry, exit, and gravity

The previous two facts pool firms across different destination countries. Country characteristics,
however, may be an important determinant of a firm’s development over its life-cycle.
To explore this issue, we study the correlation between first-year exit rates and entry
rates of exporters and MNEs, and two country characteristics that are prominent in the
international trade literature: the size of the destination country, as measured by GDP;
and the distance of the destination country from the firm’s home country. Our finding is
that:
Fact 3. First-year exit rates of exporters exhibit gravity, whereas those of MNEs do not.
Both entry rates for exporters and MNEs exhibit gravity.
Figure 5 shows scatter plots of first-year exit rates against market size (upper panels),
and distance (lower panel), for France. We restrict the sample to countries with at least
ten firm-destination observations. We relegate results for Norway, which are extremely
similar, to Appendix Figure D.6.
The cross-country patterns of first-year exit between the two modes of international operation
are strikingly different: While exporters operating in smaller and more distant markets
are more likely to stop operations right after entry, it is not clear that affiliates of MNEs
do.16 An OLS regression shows that the exit probability increases by almost seven percentage
points when distance doubles, and it decreases by 3.4 percentage points when GDP doubles,
with both coefficients significant at the one percent level. In contrast, the effects of GDP
and distance on the exit rates of MNE affiliates are insignificant.
Figure 6 shows the same scatter plots for the entry rates. Unlike the exit rates, both
entry rates for exporters and MNEs are correlated with country characteristics. In OLS
regressions, we find that the elasticities with respect to market size are quite similar for
exporters and MNEs, but the distance elasticities are three times as large for exporters.17
Appendix Figure D.7 shows that, for Norway, distance elasticities are also higher for
exporter entry than for MNE entry and market size elasticities are similar across the two
entry modes.
The difference of first-year exit rates between exporters and MNEs suggests that higher
sunk costs of entry for exporters than for MNEs. This fact is thus key in informing
16

Using data from Argentina, Albornoz et al. (2016) document a similar pattern for exporters: survival
probabilities decrease with distance. They rationalize this finding with a model where sunk export costs
increase with distance proportionally less than do fixed costs.
17
The elasticities with respect to market size are 0.52 (s.e. 0.027) and 0.41 (s.e. 0.033) for exporters and
MNEs, respectively; distance elasticities are -1.15 (s.e. 0.105) vs -0.36 (s.e. 0.094).

dynamic models of exporters and MNEs. The patterns observed for entry rates suggest
that exporters face distance-dependent trade costs, whereas MNEs do not, consistent with
the proximity-concentration-trade off in HMY. A static model thus suffices to capture this
fact.
Robustness. Exporters and MNEs are active in different countries: Firms penetrate many
more countries as exporters than as MNEs. To exclude that the difference in country

14

coverage drives the results, we replicate our analysis for only those countries with both
exporting and multinational activity, for France. Both the pattern of first-year exit and
entry rates for exporters are less pronounced than in the full sample, but still clearly
correlated with country characteristics.18 For MNEs, results are unchanged.

4

A dynamic model of exports and MNEs

Guided by the facts documented in the previous section, we build a dynamic model of
export and MNE activities that is based on the model of the proximity-concentration
trade-off with heterogeneous firms in HMY, extended to include an autoregressive process
for firm productivity and sunk costs for MNE activities. We construct a model of "horizontal"
FDI, i.e., affiliate sales are destined to the host market only. For simplicity, export-platforms,
i.e., locating production in market l and serving a third market n through exports from
l, and intrafirm trade are excluded.19 We focus on horizontal FDI instead of vertical FDI
as the prior literature has found horizontal FDI to be the main form of FDI activity (see
Ramondo et al., 2016).

4.1

Set up

We build a partial equilibrium model with two countries, Home and Foreign. Time
is discrete. Labor is the only factor of production and is supplied in fixed quantity.
The wage in each country is pinned down by a constant-return-to-scale freely tradable
homogeneous good sector, and normalized to one, w = 1.
Goods that are exported to the foreign country are subject to an iceberg-type trade cost,
τ ≥ 1, while production in foreign affiliates is subject to an efficiency loss given by γ ≥ 1,
with τ > γ, consistent with the empirical evidence (Antrás and Yeaple, 2014). A firm
that exports incurs a per-period fixed cost, f x , and a firm that operates an affiliate in the
foreign country incurs a per-period fixed cost f m , with f m /f x > (γ/τ )σ−1 , as in HMY.
Firms that decide to open an affiliate have to pay a sunk cost, F m > 0, at the time of MNE
entry. Fixed and sunk costs are paid in units of labor.
A firm is characterized by a core efficiency level, φ ≡ exp(z), that evolves over time
18

Export exit elasticities with respect to GDP and distance are -0.023 (s.e. 0.003) and 0.046 (s.e. 0.005),
while entry elasticities with respect to the same variables are 0.23 (s.e. 0.026) and -0.53 (s.e. 0.112).
19
See Ramondo and Rodríguez-Clare (2013) and Tintelnot (2017) for recent models of export-platform
FDI.

15

following a first-order autoregressive AR(1) process,
z 0 = ρz + σ 0 ,
where 0 ≤ ρ < 1 and 0 ∼ N (0, 1). If a firm from the Home country opens an affiliate in
the Foreign country, that affiliate inherits its parent’s productivity process.
There exists a continuum of firms that compete monopolistically, and have access to a
continuum of differentiated products. The mass of Home firms, M , is fixed and normalized
to one. We assume Constant-Elasticity-of-Substitution (CES) preferences, with the elasticity
of substitution denoted by σ. Firms optimally charge a constant mark-up, κ ≡ σ/(σ − 1),
over marginal costs, so that sales follow the standard CES formula. Let E ≡ κ1−σ X/P 1−σ
be foreign demand. We assume that the firms from the home country account only for
a small fraction of the overall sales in the foreign country, so that the price index in the
foreign country is taken as fixed. We normalize Ehome = 1 so that E is the size of Foreign
relative to Home.
Static profit maximization implies that domestic sales are given by X d (φ) = φσ−1 , while
exports from Home are X x (φ) = Eφσ−1 τ 1−σ , and affiliate sales in Foreign are X m (φ) =
Eφσ−1 γ 1−σ .
Firms have two possible states: producing in the home market for domestic consumers
only and, potentially, for foreign consumers (D); or producing in the home market for
domestic consumers and in the foreign market for foreign consumers (M). The value of
being a multinational firm with core productivity φ is given by
X m (φ)

(2)

The optimal policy for an MNE is to discontinue the foreign investment if being domestic
(state D) entails larger discounted expected profits than being MNE (state M). This policy
is characterized by a cutoff value of productivity φ̄m . If productivity falls below φ̄m , a
current MNE exits the foreign market and produces only in the domestic market. If
16

productivity exceeds φ̄m , the firm remains an MNE (state M). Similarly, the optimal policy
for a domestic firm is characterized by a productivity cutoff level, φ̄m
e . Once the productivity
level of the domestic firm exceeds φ̄m
e , it becomes an MNE. It is possible to rank the two
productivity cut-offs: Since the second terms in the outer maximization problem in (1)
and (2), respectively, are identical, and X m and V are increasing in φ, as the expectation
operator preserves monotonicity, it follows that φ̄m < φ̄m
e . This implies that the model
delivers an "inaction" zone that exists by virtue of the sunk cost of doing FDI (Baldwin,
1989). Domestic firms with productivity φ ∈ [φ̄m , φ̄m
e ] remain domestic, while MNEs with
m
m
productivity φ ∈ [φ̄ , φ̄e ] remain MNEs. The inaction zone, thus, creates persistence in
the MNE status.
Without sunk MNE costs, it suffices to have f m /f x > (γ/τ )1−σ for MNEs to have a higher
exit cutoff than exporters, φ̄m > φ̄x . With sunk MNE costs, that assumption is not enough.
We proceed by assuming that the MNE exit cutoff is higher than the exporter exit cutoff.20

4.2

Model predictions

We now explain how the model captures the facts documented in Section 3.
The model can capture Fact 1 under some conditions. The "inaction" zone created by the
presence of sunk and fixed costs makes MNEs less likely to exit than in a setup with no
sunk costs. That exit rates for MNEs are lower than for exporters—and by how much—
depends on the values of the model’s parameters. Proposition 1 states the result.
m
Proposition 1. Let the entry cut-off for MNEs ln(φ̄m
e ) = z̄e and the entry and exit cut-off
for exports ln(φ̄x ) = z̄ x relate as z̄em = z̄ x + ϕ, with ϕ > 0. There exists ϕ∗ such that for
0 ≤ ϕ < ϕ∗ , the exit probability upon entry is higher for an exporter than for an MNE
with identical productivity before exit.

Proof. See Appendix B.1.
The effect of export experience on the exit probability of an MNE is driven by selection
on productivity, as Proposition 2 shows.
Proposition 2. The probability that a new MNE exits upon entry is lower if the firm
switched from export to MNE activity than from domestic to MNE activity.
20
The assumption that φ̄m > φ̄x is implicit in the way we wrote the value functions: It rules out that, for
the marginal MNE, the value of producing at home for the domestic market only is higher than the value
of producing at home for the domestic and foreign market. In our calibrations and simulations below, this
ranking of cutoffs is never violated.

17

Proof. See Appendix B.2.
All new MNEs have received a sufficiently good productivity shock that induces them
to enter a market as MNEs. As exporters are more productive than domestic firms, firms
with export experience enter MNE status with a productivity level that is higher than that
of a firm with no export experience. Given that productivity follows a Markov process
with log-normal distributed shocks, and the exit cutoffs are the same for MNEs with
and without export experience, more productive firms at the time of entry are less likely
to have a productivity draw that falls below the exit cutoff in the subsequent period.
Proposition 2 is for the case of positive sunk costs of MNE entry, but the result also holds
in the case of no sunk MNE costs.
Both exporters and MNEs follow the same productivity process in the model. However,
this does not automatically lead to the similar sales growth rates of exporters and MNEs
documented in Fact 2. The selection patterns that arise from the inclusion of fixed and
sunk costs have subtle effects on the growth rates. Ultimately, how well the model can
capture the similarity of exporter and MNE growth rates remains a quantitative question,
which we address in Section 5. Self-selection of firms also drives the higher sales growth
of ever-MNE exporters relative to never-MNE exporters.
Finally, the inclusion of sunk MNE costs allows the model to capture Fact 3: First-year
exit rates of new exporters are correlated with country characteristics, while for MNEs,
they are not. The following proposition shows the result.
Proposition 3. Let z̄ be the productivity exit cutoff from a mode of international operation.
The increase in the first-year exit probability when z̄ increases is larger when sunk costs
of entry into the mode are zero than when sunk costs are positive.
Proof. See Appendix B.3.
Because of MNE sunk costs, the productivity level required for MNE entry exceeds the
m
m
productivity level for MNE exit, φ̄m
e > φ̄ . The higher the sunk costs, F , the higher the
option value of being an MNE and, hence, the larger the zone of inaction and the less
sensitive the exit behavior to differences in variable profits.21
An important implication of the model is that new exporters in an environment without
the option to become MNE have different life-cycle properties than in an environment
where they can self-select into MNE activities. Intuitively, including the MNE choice
21

In an export-only model, Albornoz et al. (2016) show that the probability of export survival in a
market increases with the ratio of sunk to fixed costs. While their result is about how export survival
rates change with sunk costs, our Proposition 3 states a difference-in-difference result: How the survival—
or, equivalently, exit—probability changes due to a change of market characteristics, for different levels of
sunk costs.

not only truncates the exporters’ distribution of productivity levels, but also induces a
truncation to-the-right of the distribution of productivity growth rates. Only firms with
productivity above the export, but below the MNE threshold in two consecutive periods
contribute to export productivity (and sales) growth. For each z ∈ [φ̄x , φ̄m ], there is a
maximum possible increase in productivity such that an exporter remains an exporter.
Exporters that receive a higher productivity shock turn into MNEs when the MNE choice
is allowed. Those exporters with the highest productivity shocks and, thus, the highest
sales growth, do not contribute to the average growth rate of exporters in the model
with MNEs (because they change status), but they do it in the model without MNEs. In
turn, because the maximum possible growth in productivity decreases with productivity
levels, smaller exporters are the ones contributing to average productivity in the model
without MNEs, but not in the model with MNEs (because they switch status). As a
consequence, exporters in the model for which the MNE option is present have higher
average productivity early in life and, hence, lower exit rates.
Proposition 4 derives this result formally for the marginal exporter.22
Proposition 4. Assume that firm productivity follows a first-order autoregressive process,
zt = ρzt−1 + σ t , with t ∼ N (0, 1), and 0 ≤ ρ < 1, and assume that sunk costs of
MNE entry are zero, F m = 0. Consider the firm with zt−1 = z and zt > z, where z
denotes the productivity threshold above which firms become exporters. Define expected
productivity growth in a model with only left truncation in the productivity distribution
as GL ≡ E (zt − zt−1 | zt > z, zt−1 = z), while in a model with left and right truncation,
expected productivity growth is defined as GLR ≡ E (zt − zt−1 | z < zt < z̄, zt−1 = z), with
z̄ denoting the right truncation point above which the firm changes from export to MNE
status. Then, there exists a value z̄ ∗ ∈ (z, ∞) such that for z < z̄ < z̄ ∗ , GL > GLR , with
equality for z̄ = z̄ ∗ .
Proof. See Appendix B.
We quantitatively explore the effect of including the option to become MNE by comparing
calibrated versions of the model with MNEs and with only exporters in Section 6.

Calibration

We calibrate the model and analyze how well the calibrated model quantitatively captures
the patterns observed in the data. We extend the model in Section 4 to include sunk

In Appendix A.1, we show that the growth rate for the average exporter can be lower in the model
with MNEs for certain parameters’ values.

export costs and assume that both fixed and sunk export and MNE costs are firm-specific.
Appendix C presents the main equations of the extended model.
Our goal is to parameterize the extended model by targeting cross-sectional features
of the data, as well as the dynamics of domestic sales, and then assess how well our
calibrated model accounts for new affiliate and exporter dynamics as reflected in the facts
in Section 3. We perform two calibrations using moments from France and Norway to
calibrate the parameters of the model. We present the calibration not only for France, but
also for Norway because the information on MNE sales in the French data is very limited.
We use the top 15 destination markets for exports and MNEs, plus a sixteenth country
constructed as a weighted average of the rest of the world (RoW). The top 15 destinations
represent more than 75 percent of export and MNE sales.23
For each destination, we calibrate the values of the iceberg trade and MNE costs, the mean
and variance of the per-period export and MNE fixed costs, the mean and variance of the
sunk costs of MNE and export entry, and the relative market size. Consistent with the
model presented in the previous section, we abstract away from export-platforms sales,
so that entry into each destination country can be solved independently. As in the model,
we restrict the analysis to a partial equilibrium setting in which wages and price indices
are exogenous.

5.1

Calibration procedure

We set the discount factor for firms β = 0.95, which is consistent with an interest rate of
five percent. The elasticity of substitution σ is set to 4, which implies a mark-up over unit
cost of 33 percent and is a common value estimated for the trade elasticity.
A first set of parameters can be calibrated without solving for the firm’s problem. Given
1
σ, we use the ratio of export to domestic sales, rnx ≡ (Xnx (φ)/X d (φ)) 1−σ = En τn1−σ , for
firms serving market n, to get an estimate of size-adjusted trade costs for market n.
1
Analogously, we use the ratio of MNE to domestic sales, rnm ≡ (Xnm (φ)/X d (φ)) 1−σ =
En γn1−σ , for MNE affiliates operating in market n, to get an estimate of size-adjusted MNE
costs for market n.24 We calculate rnx and rnm , respectively, as a weighted average across
firms serving market n in each mode, with weights given by the firm’s domestic sales.
23

In the French data, it is not possible to distinguish exports to Belgium from exports to Luxembourg.
Therefore, we aggregate Belgium-Luxembourg and the Netherlands into one country (Benelux). Due to its
increasing importance, we add China to the list of foreign destination for France.
24
In order to gain observations, for some destinations of French MNEs, we impute missing MNE sales
using as covariates (log) domestic sales, (log) domestic employment, an interaction of the two previous
variables, year and sector fixed effects, for firms surviving at least five years in a foreign destination.

20

For exports, we restrict attention to firms that served market n at least three years in a
row. For MNEs, we do not limit the number of years in a market (given the low number
of observations on sales for France). Appendix Table E.3 shows the values for rnx and rnm ,
for each destination market.
The parameters characterizing the Markov process for firm-level productivity, ρ and σ ,
come from estimating by OLS a first-order autoregressive process on domestic sales, using
all French and Norwegian firms (i.e., unbalanced panel). The regression includes year
and industry fixed effects, with standard errors clustered at the industry level. With these
estimates, we directly set ρ equal to the estimated sales autocorrelation coefficient, ρ̂sales ,
and σ equal to σ̂sales /(σ − 1). For France, ρ = 0.960 and σ = 0.197, while for Norway, our
estimates imply that ρ = 0.957 and σ = 0.133.25
The remaining parameters of the model are jointly calibrated, for each market. We assume
that sunk (fixed) costs are drawn from a log-normal distribution, are constant for each
firm over time, and are independent from firm productivity. The relevant market-specific
sunk and fixed cost parameters are: the mean and standard deviation of sunk export

costs, µxen and σen
; the mean and variance of sunk MNE costs, µm

σfmn and σfxn by assuming the coefficient of variation in sunk and fixed cost draws for

six moments, for each market: the fraction of non-MNE French (Norwegian) exporters
serving market n, relative to French (Norwegian) firms that do not serve market n with
exports (which includes non-exporter firms and exporters to other destinations); the fraction
of French (Norwegian) MNEs serving market n, relative to French (Norwegian) firms
that do not serve market n with an affiliate (which includes non-MNE firms and MNEs to
other destinations); the share of French (Norwegian) MNEs that exit at age zero (i.e., entry
year) market n, relative to MNE stayers in market n; the share of French (Norwegian)
exporters that exit at age zero (i.e., entry year) market n, relative to exporter stayers in
market n; the average share of French (Norwegian) MNEs that exit market n, relative to
MNE stayers in market n; and the average share of French (Norwegian) exporters that
exit market n, relative to exporter stayers in market n. Appendix Tables E.4 and E.5
show targeted moments in the model and data, an average across destinations and by
destination. Appendix Table E.6 presents the calibrated parameters by destination.
Results below are calculated from model and data observations at the firm-destinationyear level. As for the facts in Section 3, for expositional purposes, we present averages
across the destinations included in our samples, weighted by each destination’s share of

Results are very similar if we estimate a Tobit model rather than a linear model.

contains the results by destination.

5.2

Calibration results

We evaluate the size of the calibrated per-period fixed costs and sunk entry costs, for
exports and MNE activities, in terms of one year of firm sales, and in monetary values.
Table 1 presents the results.
Sunk costs, particularly for exports, do not seem to be a heavy burden on firms deciding
to internationalize. For MNEs, sunk costs represent around ten percent of annual sales
for smaller firms and around five percent for larger firms, according to our calibration
for Norway. For French MNEs, our calibration suggests that these sunk costs, in terms
of sales, are half those faced by Norwegian MNEs. In monetary terms, for Norwegian
MNEs, sunk costs range from less than 300,000 to almost 4.5 million U.S. dollars. In
contrast, the calibrated sunk export costs are very small, around 0.2-0.5 percent of annual
export sales.

22

Fixed operating costs, however, are relatively much larger. Fixed costs represent around
nine percent of foreign sales for large Norwegian exporters and reach more than 20 percent
for small exporters; per-period MNEs costs are slightly lower in terms of sales. Our
calibrated values for French exporters and MNEs entail slightly lower per-period costs, in
terms of annual sales, than for Norwegian firms. In monetary terms, given the difference
in size between MNEs and exporters, per-period fixed costs for exporters are around one
million U.S. dollars for the 90th percentile of Norwegian exporters, but reach almost 6.5
million U.S. dollars for the largest Norwegian MNEs. Appendix Table E.7 presents results
by destination market for the median exporter (MNE) in terms of sales in each destination.

5.3

Fit of calibrated model

We now evaluate how well our calibrated model captures the facts in Section 3. We start
by comparing the exit rates of new exporters and MNEs in the data and the model. Our
calibration procedure targets exit rates of MNEs and exporters at entry and on average,
but not at each age. Figure 7 shows that our calibrated model does fairly well in capturing
the life-cycle dynamics of exit for new MNEs and new exporters. Even though the firstyear exit rate is a targeted moment, the model underestimates how much exit is observed
upon entry into a market, particularly for exporters. But the quantitative model captures
well the decline in exit rates with age. Targeting the first-year exit rate is crucial to obtain
this decline; when this moment is not included in the calibration, exit rates increase, rather
than decrease, with age.26
Figure 8 shows the ability of the model to capture the growth profiles of MNE and export
sales. We compute the geometric average across destination markets and normalize sales
with respect to age one (i.e., one year after entry). The model matches the flat sales profile
for MNEs remarkably well, as well as the growth profile of export sales, for Norway. The
model calibrated to France, however, delivers exporters that, after age one, grow faster
than in the data.
To evaluate the model’s ability to quantitatively capture Fact 3 in Section 3, we estimate
by OLS the elasticity of exit rates at age zero and entry rates, for exporters and MNEs,
on geography-adjusted country size, rnx ≡ En τn1−σ (rnm ≡ En γn1−σ ), across the destinations
included in our calibration, for Norway and France. We use the observed and simulated
26

This is also the case in Ruhl and Willis (2017) (see their Figure 2b and 3b): When they target first-year
exit rates for exporters, they obtain exit rates that decline with age; when they only target the average exit
rate, they obtain exit rates that increase with age.

that these regressions have only 16 observations. Still, the model delivers sharper results
for exporters exit rates than for MNEs, as the theory predicts and our third fact shows:
New exporters’ exit rates decrease with size-adjusted iceberg cots, while new MNEs’ exit
rates do not have a clear pattern. The model’s implied entry rates elasticities are larger
for MNEs than for exporters as observed in the data, but the model difference between
the two is smaller.

Table 2 includes comparisons for other non-targeted moments. Panel 3 shows that the
calibrated model correctly captures the fact that new experienced MNEs have lower exit
rates than non-experienced MNEs. Yet, the calibrated model delivers virtually zero new
MNEs that were not previously exporters. Additionally, starter rates in the model are
fairly closed to the ones observed in the French data. The model also captures rather
accurately the transitions from/to export and domestic status, and from/to MNE and
domestic status. But the model over-predicts the transition from/to MNE and export
status: Too many exporters become MNEs, and too many MNEs transition into only
exporters.

5.4

Model calibration with only exporters

The goal of our counterfactual exercises is to assess whether the option to become MNE
changes the predictions of the standard export dynamics model under a trade-liberalization
shock. Before turning to the counterfactual exercises, we therefore compare the goodness
of fit of our calibrated model with MNEs to a calibrated model with only exporters.
The calibration of the exporter-only model targets exactly the same moments related to
exporters as our calibration of the model with MNEs — in particular, the parametrization
of the productivity process is the same.27
27

The calibrated model with only exporters matches the export-related targeted and non-targeted
moments equally well as the model with MNEs (not shown). Appendix Table E.6 shows the calibrated
values of per-period and sunk export costs for the model without MNEs.

Notes: The elasticity of first-year exit rates (entry rates) to size-adjusted iceberg costs (rnx and rnm , for exporters
and MNEs, respectively) is the OLS coefficient of a bivariate regression (with a constant), using the 16 countries
included in the calibration, for France and Norway. The fraction of experienced MNEs is calculated as the
number of new MNEs of age zero with previous export experience in a market, relative to all new MNEs of
age zero entering that market. Starter rates for exporters are calculated as the number of firms that export to
j in t, but not in t − 1, relative to the number of Home firms at t − 1. Starter rates for MNEs are calculated
as the number of MNEs that have an affiliate j in t, but not in t − 1, relative to the number of Home firms at
t − 1. The transition probabilities are calculated for all firms, a weighted average across destinations: exporter to
MNE (domestic) is relative to the number of non-MNE exporters; domestic to MNE (exporter) is relative to the
number of domestic firms; and MNE to exporter (domestic) is relative to the number of MNEs. Observations
are at the firm-destination-year level. Averages across destinations included in the calibration are weighted by
each destination’s share of export (MNE) firms, except for starter rates, and transitions from domestic status,
which are weighted by (the inverse of) the number of destinations. Weights are data-based (model-based) for
data (model) variables. Exporters in the data refers to non-MNE exporters. Levels of significance denoted by ***

Appendix Figure D.10a compares exit rates for exporters, averaged across destination
markets, in the data and in the calibrated model with and without MNEs, for France.
While the model with MNEs does slightly better in matching exit of young exporters, the
model with only exporters does better for older exporter.28 In contrast with the results
in Ruhl and Willis (2017), both our calibrated models feature a monotonic decrease in
exit rates with age. This is entirely driven by targeting first-year exit rates. This moment
is responsible for calibrated sunk export costs that are close to zero, and hence, for an
extremely small band of inaction for exporters.
Appendix Figure D.10b shows that the model with MNEs produces sales profiles for
exporters that are slightly flatter (three percentage-points lower) and closer to the data
than the model with only exporters.29 This finding reflects the result that a model with
left and right truncation can yield exporters that grow more slowly than exporters in a
model with only left truncation. Yet, demand-side frictions, as the ones considered by
Arkolakis (2016) and Ruhl and Willis (2017) would be needed to fully match the data on
new exporters’ growth.
As we described in Section 4, at the core of the model’s mechanism is the self-selection
of fast-growing exporters into MNE activities. Appendix Figure D.11 compares growth
profiles for ever-MNE and never-MNE exporters in the two models and the data. This
figure reveals that the difference in growth rates between the two models is mainly due
to the never-MNE exporters. The model with MNEs predicts better the growth profile of
new exporters that never switch to MNE status—the bulk of exporters in the data. The
two models perform similarly well in capturing the observed dynamics of exporters that
later in life become MNEs.
In the next section, we turn to the effects of trade liberalization episodes on aggregate and
life-cycle dynamics of exporters and MNEs. We compare the predictions of the model
with MNEs to the predictions of the model with only exporters.

The effects of trade liberalization

Armed with the calibrated model, we analyze the effects of trade liberalization on aggregate
dynamics and life-cycle dynamics of MNEs and exporters. For exporters, we further show
the effects predicted by the calibrated model without MNEs. Even though the differences
between the calibrated model with and without MNEs in fitting the data are not very

Appendix Figure D.8 shows results by destination.
Differences become more pronounced when one considers exporters that survive longer in the market
(not shown).

large, the two models can deliver different predictions regarding counterfactual exercises.
We simulate a 20-percent change in the iceberg-trade cost, τn , for all destinations n, keeping
the foreign demand, En , in the destinations unchanged (partial equilibrium).

6.1

Aggregate dynamics

Figure 9 shows the evolution from the old to the new steady state of average sales and
participation rates for MNEs and exporters. The average MNE sales increase by around
30 percent when trade costs decrease, while participation rates for MNEs decrease by
half. The transition is rather fast, with most of the adjustment taking place within three
periods. Given that sunk export costs are very low, most of the transition to the new
steady state for exporters occurs in one period: for the case of decreasing trade costs,
average export sales and participation rates are both about 30-percent higher than in
the initial steady state. Interestingly, the model without MNEs predicts smaller effects
for exporters: average sales increase by less than 25 percent and the participation rates
increase by only around 24-percent, when trade costs decrease by 20 percent. At the heart
of these differences is the self-selection of exporters into MNE activities when that option
is included in the model.
It is worth noting that increases and decreases in trade costs from the calibrated values
do not produce symmetric changes in the aggregate variables under consideration. For
instance, participation rates for exporters drop by 60 percent when trade costs increase,
but increase by 30 percent when trade costs decrease.

Life-cycle dynamics

In Figure 10 we show the steady-state exit rates and sales profiles, by age, for MNEs and
for exporters for the baseline economy, an economy with 20 percent higher trade costs,
and an economy with 20 percent lower trade costs.30
While life-cycle exit patterns of MNEs do not change much with trade-costs changes,
life-cycle growth becomes slower in an environment with lower trade costs: by age four,
new MNE sales (relative to entry) are five-percentage points lower than in our calibrated
baseline.
For exporters, including MNEs matters for the effects of moving from an environment
30

Because we only use data from the calibrated model, in Figure 10, we normalize sales relative to sales
at age 0 rather than age 1 as in Figures 3, 4 and 8.

with high trade costs to one with low trade costs. The model with MNEs predicts that
new exporters decrease their life-cycle exit rates by seven percentage points by age nine
and experience higher sales growth (eight percentage points by age four). The model
without MNEs, however, predicts that new exporters have very similar exit and growth
patterns before and after the change. These differences between the two models translate
into differences in the dynamic behavior of aggregate exports after a shock shown in
Figure 9.
A lower τ decreases the likelihood of becoming an MNE, but increases the one of becoming
(or staying) an exporter; in the limit, for τ = 1, MNEs disappear and the model collapses
to one without MNEs. This implies that exporters’ life-cycle profiles are, on average, less
similar between the model with and without MNEs as τ increases. At the same time, a
change in trade costs produces a larger change in the life-cycle patterns of exit and growth
rates of the average exporter in the model with MNEs than in the model without MNEs.
This is because the model with MNEs has two (left and right) margins changing at the
same time, which results in a larger change in the number of fast-growing exporters.
Finally, Figure 10 naturally relates to the effects of liberalizing MNE activities on new
exporters’ dynamics. Since the differences in new exporters dynamics between the model
with and without MNEs is larger in an environment with high iceberg trade costs, moving
from a scenario without MNEs to one with MNEs leads to small changes in new exporters’
dynamics if trade costs are already low, but large changes if trade costs are high.

Conclusions

This paper studies the life-cycle dynamics of exporters and MNEs. We provide a comprehensive
set of facts on the life-cycle dynamics of new exporters and new MNEs that are informative
about the features to be included in dynamic models of exporters’ and MNEs’ behavior.
We show that a dynamic model of the proximity-concentration trade-off in Helpman et al.
(2004) is qualitatively consistent with the documented facts. Our calibrated version of
the model also includes heterogenous sunk and fixed costs at the firm-destination level,
similar to Roberts and Tybout (1997). We show that, quantitatively, the standard model of
exports dynamics augmented to include MNEs goes far in matching cross-sectional and
dynamic moments of the data on both exporters and MNEs.
Comparing the predictions of our calibrated model with both exporters and MNEs and
a dynamic model with only exporters, we find that enriching the canonical dynamic
model of trade to include MNEs—a first-order feature of the data—has consequences

Expected productivity growth for the average exporter

Assume that firm productivity follows a first-order autoregressive process, zt = ρzt−1 +
σ t , with t ∼ N (0, 1), and 0 ≤ ρ < 1. The expected value of zt is zero with variance given
by σz2 ≡ σ2 /(1 − ρ2 ).
Conditional on a starting productivity value of k, the expected growth for an exporter in
t in the model with only left truncation is given by
GL (k) ≡ E (zt − zt−1 | zt > z, zt−1 = k) ,
while in a model with left and right truncation, we have that
GLR (k) ≡ E (zt − zt−1 | z < zt < z̄, z = k) ,
with z and z̄ denoting the left and right truncation points, respectively.
After some algebra, we get that
GL (k) = σ
and
GLR (k) = σ

Since the denominator is always positive, we need to show that the numerator is negative.

We then need to show that there exists only one point m ∈ [c, ∞] such that for x < m,

Since for ξ > 0 and ξ → 0, G(x − ξ) = G(x) − ξg(x) and g(x − ξ) = g(x) − ξg 0 (x), replacing,
we get that

Proof of Proposition 3

Firm-productivity z follows a first-order autoregressive process, z 0 = ρz + σ 0 with 0 ∼
N (0, 1) and 0 ≤ ρ ≤ 1. Let z̄ denote the exit cutoff and z̄e the entry cutoff into an
international activity. Let c be a constant in the interval [z̄e , ∞). Let
Rc
f (a) =

Pr(ρx + σ  ≤ z̄ | x)g(x − ρa)dx

z̄e

G(c) − G(z̄e − ρa)

denote the probability of exit from status i in t+1 for a firm that is not yet in status i
in t-1 and that has a productivity level of a in t-1. The functions g(·) and G(·) denote,
respectively, the probability and cumulative density functions of a normal distribution
with mean zero and dispersion parameter σ .
Let ξ and ϕ be two positive constants, with ξ ≤ ϕ. Without loss of generality, the entry
cutoff is z̄e = z̄ + ϕ. We want to show that when we increase the exit cutoff from z̄ to z̄ + ξ,
39

the exit probability increases more when sunk costs are zero—i.e., ϕ = 0,
f (a; ξ > 0; ϕ = 0) − f (a; ξ = 0; ϕ = 0) > f (a; ξ > 0; ϕ > 0) − f (a; ξ = 0; ϕ > 0).
The first term is given by

f (a; ξ > 0; ϕ = 0) − f (a; ξ = 0; ϕ = 0) =

(B.6)

G(c) − G(z̄ − ρa)

while the second one is
Rc

Pr(ρx + σ  ≤ z̄ + ξ | x)g(x − ρa)dx

z̄+ϕ

f (a; ξ > 0; ϕ > 0) − f (a; ξ = 0; ϕ > 0) =

Rc

Pr(ρx + σ  ≤ z̄ | x)g(x − ρa)dx

z̄+ϕ

−

.

G(c) − G(z̄ + ϕ − ρa)

(B.7)

Rearranging, we get that
f (a; ξ > 0; ϕ = 0) − f (a; ξ > 0; ϕ > 0) > f (a; ξ = 0; ϕ = 0) − f (a; ξ = 0; ϕ > 0),
which, after some algebra, yields
Rc

Denominators are always positive and simplify. The numerators can be written as

z̄+ϕ

z̄

and analogously for the numerator in the right-hand side of the inequality. Hence,
z̄+ϕ
Z
Pr(ρx + σ  ≤ z̄ + ξ | x)g(x − ρa)dx >

z̄+ϕ
Z
Pr(ρx + σ  ≤ z̄ | x)g(x − ρa)dx.

z̄

z̄

Because Pr(ρx + σ  ≤ z̄ + ξ | x) > Pr(ρx + σ  ≤ z̄ | x), we show that when we increase the
exit cutoff, the probability of exit upon entry increases by less with the presence of sunk
costs. 

Proof of Proposition 4

Let φ(·) and Φ(·) denote the p.d.f. and c.d.f., respectively, of a standard normal distribution.
Then,
GL ≡ E (zt − zt−1 | zt > z, zt−1 = z) = E (zt | zt > z, zt−1 = z) − z
= E (ρzt−1 + σ t | zt > z, zt−1 = z) − z = ρz + E (σ t | zt > z, zt−1 = z) − z
= ρz + σ E (t | t > z(1 − ρ)/σ ) − z = σ E (t | t > c) − σ c


φ(c)
= σ
−c ,
1 − Φ(c)

where c ≡ (1 − ρ)z/σ . Similar calculations yield
LR

G


≡ E (zt − zt−1 | z < zt < z̄, zt−1 = z) = σ


φ(c) − φ(c̄)
−c ,
Φ(c̄) − Φ(c)

where c̄ ≡ (1 − ρ)z̄/σ .
Growth is higher with left (L) than with left and right (LR) truncation when
φ(c)
φ(c) − φ(c̄)
>
,
1 − Φ(c)
Φ(c̄) − Φ(c)
or equivalently,
Φ(c̄) − Φ(c)
φ(c) − φ(c̄)
>
.
1 − Φ(c)
φ(c)
The expression on the left-hand side (l.h.s.) of the inequality has the following properties:
lim
c̄→c

Φ(c̄) − Φ(c)
= 0;
1 − Φ(c)

lim

c̄→∞

Φ(c̄) − Φ(c)
= 1;
1 − Φ(c)

dl.h.s.
φ(c̄)
=
· > 0.
dc̄
1 − Φ(c)

With z̄ > z, and c̄ > 0, the expression on the right-hand side (r.h.s.) of the inequality has

41

the following properties:
φ(c) − φ(c̄)
= 0;
c̄→c
φ(c)

lim

φ(c) − φ(c̄)
= 1;
c̄→∞
φ(c)
lim

dr.h.s.
φ(c̄)
= c̄
> 0.
dc̄
φ(c)

Both functions have the same limits and both are increasing with c̄. The left-hand side,
however, grows faster than the right-hand side when
c̄ <

φ(c)
.
1 − Φ(c)

Therefore, there exits c̄∗ —and consequently, z̄ ∗ —such that for all c < c̄ < c̄∗ , GL > GLR ,
with GL = GLR for c̄ = c̄∗ .

C

Quantitative model

We extend the model in Section 4 to include sunk export costs, F x > 0, paid in units of
labor and F m > F x . Additionally, we assume that all fixed and sunk costs are heterogeneous
across firms, but fixed over time for each firm. Fixed and sunk costs distributions are
independent of the firm productivity distribution, and follow a log-normal distribution,
log(Fes ) ∼ N (µse , (σes )2 )

and

log(f s ) ∼ N (µs , (σ s )2 ),

where s = m, x.
Firms have three possible states: producing in the domestic market for home consumers
only(D); producing in the domestic market for home and foreign consumers (X); or
producing in the domestic market for home consumers and in the foreign market for
foreign consumers (M ).

An MNE chooses among continuing its operations abroad and incurring the per-period
fixed cost f m ; shutting down the affiliate and becoming an exporter into the foreign
market, incurring a per-period fixed cost f x and sunk cost F x ; or abandoning the foreign
market altogether.

Notes: Models calibrated to French data. (D.10a): number of exits from a mode-market relative to the
number of firms active in a mode-market, by mode-market-specific age. (D.10b): log of firm-destination
export sales with respect to firm-destination export sales in the year after entry, an average over firms
with five or more years in the market. In the data, log of sales are first demeaned by industry, year, and
destination fixed effects. Observations are at the firm-destination-year level. We show averages across
destinations included in the calibration, weighted by each destination’s share of export firms. Weights are
data-based (model-based) for data (model) variables. Exporters in the data refers to non-MNE exporters.

Notes: Models calibrated to French data. Log of firm-destination export sales with respect to firm-destination
export sales in the year after export entry, an average over firms with five or more years in the market as
exporters. Observations are at the firm-destination-year level. We show averages across destinations included in
the calibration, weighted by each destination’s share of export firms. Never-MNE exporters are exporters that,
in our sample period, do not change to MNE status. Ever-MNE exporters are exporters that become MNEs after
export entry. Exports for ever-MNE exporters are computed for the years before MNE entry. Exporters in the
data refers to non-MNE exporters.

Notes: Share of exporters (MNEs) to market n calculated relative to firms that do not export to (do not have affiliates in)
destination n. Exporter (MNE) exit rates are calculated relative to exporters (MNEs) that stay in the market. First-year
exit rate refers to exit at age zero. RoW refers to the rest of the world, a weighted average among the remaining countries
in the sample. Exporters in the data refers to non-MNE exporters. Observations are at the firm-destination-year level.

Notes: fnx are per-period fixed export costs; fnm are per-period fixed MNE costs; Fnx are sunk export costs;
and Fnm are sunk MNE costs. The fixed and sunk export (MNE) cost values are conditional means across
random draws, conditional on positive measure of exporters (MNEs). Median firm refers to the firm with
median export (MNE) sales in destination n. RoW refers to the rest of the world, a weighted average among
the remaining countries in the sample.
