Characterizing the Drug Development Pipeline for Precision Medicines

JEL No. I1,L5,O3
ABSTRACT
Precision medicines – therapies that rely on the use of genetic, epigenetic, and protein biomarkers
– create a better match between patients with specific disease subtypes and medications that are
more effective for those patients. This heterogeneity in response has implications for the decision
to develop therapies, their pricing, the design of clinical trials, and the relative importance of
smaller biotech companies versus more traditional companies in pursuing early stage R&D. To
understand the scope of these effects, we use a comprehensive database of over 130,000 global
clinical trials and describe the drug development pipeline for precision medicines over the past
two decades. We identify clinical trials for likely precision medicines (LPMs) as those that use
one or more relevant biomarkers. We then further segment trials based on the nature of the
biomarker(s) used and other trial features with economic implications. Since cancers represent a
disease setting in which precision therapies are already successfully used, and since cancer
applications of precision medicine are expected to grow rapidly over the coming years, we
separately characterize cancer LPMs. Finally, we consider the types of firms pursuing R&D in
precision medicines, considering how LPM R&D activities have evolved over recent years.

1.! INTRODUCTION
While lacking a universally agreed upon definition, Precision Medicine is broadly understood to be an
approach to disease treatment and prevention that takes into account variability in environment, lifestyle,
and genes for each person.1 Although the concept of targeted interventions for certain types of patients
has a long history across the practice of medicine, recent technological advancements in genetic sequencing, large-scale data storage and analysis, and computing power have made it increasingly possible to tailor
the development and utilization of medical technologies. This possibility has drawn attention and funding
from beyond traditionally interested parties such as firms and investors in the biotech and pharmaceutical
industries. For example, in early 2015, the White House announced a “bold new research effort to revolutionize how we improve health and treat disease,” and launched a Precision Medicine Initiative with a $215
million investment in 2016.2 Other countries such as France and China have also announced major public
investments ranging from the equivalent of several hundreds of millions to several billions of U.S. dollars
over coming years. Major investments to advance precision medicine have also been announced by a number of U.S. research institutions such as Harvard University and the University of California San Francisco.3
Below, we consider a subset of the broad set of practices encompassed by “precision medicine” and
focus specifically on the clinical development of precision medicines, i.e. those therapies focused on biomarker-defined patient subgroups. Precision medicines – therapies that rely on genetic, epigenetic, and
protein biomarkers – can help patients by using identifiable biological features (biomarkers) to define disease subtypes. The technology to rapidly and accurately sequence genes has increasingly facilitated an understanding of the “-omic” (i.e. genomic and proteomic) characteristics of disease in recent years. This, in
turn, has broadened the scope for drug development focusing on targeted therapies for newly-identifiable
sub-groups of patients. Notably, the public efforts noted above have lagged private endeavors in this area:

the pharmaceutical industry4 has already commercialized almost 150 drugs with pharmacogenomic information in their label, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA),5 suggesting there are
already substantial economic incentives for private firms to invest in the development of precision medicines.
We focus on precision medicines because in theory they allow for a better match between individuals
with specific disease sub-types and medications that are more effective for those sub-types. While the
science underlying these medicines is broadly interesting and is the subject of a growing body of research,
the ability to (more) precisely match patients and medications based on likely efficacy also fundamentally
changes many of the economic incentives that pharmaceutical manufacturers face in the drug development
process. Given the growing importance of these medicines, changing incentives can have far-reaching
implications on the entire pharmaceutical industry.
Perhaps most importantly, the ability to develop more targeted products may influence the decision
process that determines which new drugs firms attempt to bring to market. These decisions will then
subsequently be reflected in the equilibrium prices and availability of new pharmaceutical products. For
example, almost by definition, precision medicines tend to target smaller patient populations than more
traditional medicines. This may mean that manufacturers will shift their attention to the subset of products
able to command high(er) prices, all else equal – and thus are more likely to justify the fixed costs of
developing the medication. These higher priced products are likely to include those with large clinical
benefits, which may be more apparent in readily identifiable patient populations. In addition, since these
drugs are more efficacious within a smaller patient population, the marginal customer is expected to have
a greater willingness to pay, allowing for higher profit maximizing prices on the part of manufacturers.
These two factors together provide an economic rationale for the broadly higher prices observed for precision medicines.
Economic incentives could also, all else held equal, result in some products no longer being brought
to market because manufacturers don’t believe they can reasonably expect to recuperate their research and
development (R&D) expenditures from the relatively small target patient populations. For example, with

increasingly small patient populations we might expect a decrease in brand-brand competition for particular patients as new potential entrants find the prospects of competing for a small(er) market to be an
unattractive economic opportunity. Perhaps more concerning for price competition, a similar dynamic
could exist for the eventual generic and biosimilar markets for precision medicines, which would extend
the period of pricing power far beyond the period of patent protection.
Potentially counteracting this effect is manufacturers’ ability to create identifiable subgroups of patients
based on their willingness to pay, so-called “indication-based pricing.” Such an ability on the part of manufacturers increases the scope for future price-discrimination as manufacturers could, theoretically, more
easily charge higher prices for high-value indications and lower prices for indications or patients where
therapies will work less well (Chandra and Garthwaite, 2017). This would (weakly) increase the profits
from any particular product with an existing biomarker and increase the subset of early-stage products that
pharmaceutical manufacturers would consider as candidates for commercialization.
In addition, greater expected therapeutic benefit may result in smaller and/or shorter clinical trials
because fewer patients would be needed and/or shorter periods of time would be sufficient for demonstrating statistically significant improvements in outcomes. Smaller and/or faster trials would both decrease
the costs of bringing a drug to market and could increase the drug’s effective patent length,6 increasing the
set of pipeline drugs considered as potentially worthwhile R&D investments. These factors together, along
with innovations in clinical trial designs – such as adaptive platform trials, which are particularly well-suited
to precision medicine approaches – could counteract some of the negative entry incentives that might be
created by small patient populations, however the costs associated with trial recruiting are likely to be
higher than traditional “all-comers” trials that include a broad set of patients with a given disease.
Despite the potential for precision medicines to both reduce some of the costs of drug development
and also increase the patient value created by new products, markets for some medicines may still be so
small that private firms will lack the necessary incentives for bringing therapies to market. This would

Patent life for a drug in the U.S. is generally 20 years from the date the application is filed, and manufacturers can file a
patent application any time before or during a drug’s development process. Therefore, the time that a drug spends in
clinical trials (i.e. before the drug can be marketed) are typically counted against the 20-year patent life. Marketing exclusivity is different from patent life and is granted by the FDA upon drug approval. Exclusivity typically lasts for 5 years,
though there are extensions to exclusivity for certain cases, such as orphan drugs and pediatric indications.

create a potential role for government funding of research in these areas from sources such as the National
Institutes of Health (NIH).
Finally, the emergence of a new technology could create opportunities for additional specialization of
firms into different stages of the development process and/or create new markets for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) among pharmaceutical companies. This could, for example, lead to early-stage drug discovery being increasingly pursued by a subset of highly specialized (e.g. small, research-focused) firms.
More generally, it is possible that the emergence of precision medicines will shift the division of labor
between small biotechnology companies and large pharmaceutical companies across different stages of the
R&D process.
To help understand this collection of potential economic implications of precision medicines, we aim
to provide a detailed characterization of the existing drug development efforts in this area. We begin at a
broad level by examining the aggregate patterns in development efforts of likely precision medicines
(LPMs), those pipeline drugs whose clinical trials have signature features of precision medicine R&D. We
identify and report on the frequency of clinical trials for such products by therapeutic area and over time.
Since cancers represent a set of diseases in which precision therapies are already successfully used, and
since cancer applications of precision medicine are expected to grow rapidly over the coming years, we
separately characterize cancer LPMs. Understanding the nature of these innovations provides first order
information on the wide-ranging health care spending implications of these emerging medications.
We then examine other aspects of clinical trials that provide additional insight into the economic
mechanisms of drug development that are shaping the nature of innovation in this area. We consider the
characteristics (e.g. geography, indication, sponsorship) of clinical research between LPM vs. non-LPM
trials over the years covered in our data. Finally, we consider the types of firms pursuing clinical trials in
LPMs, considering how LPM R&D activities have evolved over recent years.

2.! PRECISION MEDICINES AND THE DRUG DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
As discussed above, we focus here on the development of precision medicines – those products that
use biomarkers to target particular subgroups of patients. To better understand how these products are

4

defined and developed, we begin by providing some background information on the science of biomarkers
and their use by various economic actors in the drug development process.

Precision medicines and biomarkers
The FDA defines a “biomarker” as “a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an
indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or biological responses to a therapeutic
intervention.” 7 A familiar example can be seen in the common medical practice of using glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), an indicator of average blood glucose levels over time, as a measure of the effectiveness
of a therapeutic agent in controlling diabetes. In this example, the biomarker (which indicates therapeutic
efficacy) is HbA1c. However, biomarkers can also be used to carve out patient subtypes of diseases, as a
treatment may work differently in patients who vary in their biomarker subtypes. In this case, a biomarker
can be used predictively to determine ex ante how likely a given patient is to benefit from a therapy. For
example, among patients with non-small cell lung cancer, those with the ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) gene mutation will benefit more from therapies like alectinib (Alecensa®) than patients without this
mutation. Similarly, the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) modulator ivacaftor
(Kalydeco®) has been approved for people with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have at least one of thirty-eight
CF mutations, out of more than 1700 mutations in the gene that causes the disease. This amounts to
approximately 3,500 potential patients in the United States.8
Many of the biomarkers that are associated with the use of precision medicines are genomic in nature.
The FDA defines a genomic biomarker as “a measurable DNA and/or RNA characteristic that is an indicator of normal biologic processes, pathogenic processes, and/or response to therapeutic or other interventions” and can be a measurement of the expression, function, or regulation of a gene (FDA, 2008). In
recent years, there have been large-scale public gene sequencing efforts – e.g. the NIH’s funding of The
Cancer Genome Atlas.9 At the same time, a host of new genomics companies have sprung up, providing
genetic sequencing technologies, including both software and hardware. An early 2017 report found that

https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/NewsEvents/ucm424545.htm
Since Kalydeco® (ivacaftor) was initially approved in 2012 for patients with the G551D mutation, the FDA has subsequently approved its use for patients with any 1 of 38 mutations. According to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, recent
approvals in May 2017 and August 2017 added an estimated 900 and 600 patients in the US to the estimated 2,000 who
were already eligible for treatment with ivacaftor. (https://www.cff.org/News)

companies in genomics and sequencing raised more money in 2016 than any other category of digital
health companies (Rock Health, 2017).
In response to the growing therapeutic market and the scientific and regulatory knowledge needed to
commercialize such technologies, public funding organizations and regulators have joined forces to harmonize language around biomarkers; in 2015, the joint leadership council of the FDA and NIH identified
“the harmonization of terms used in translational science and medical product development…with a focus
on terms related to study endpoints and biomarkers” as a priority need. One product of this effort was the
publication of the BEST (Biomarkers, EndpointS, and other Tools) Resource in December 2016 (FDA
and NIH, 2016). Appendix A lists the biomarker definitions established to-date by the FDA-NIH Biomarker Working group.
Yet these broad discussions about biomarkers often fail to differentiate among a diverse set of biomarker applications, each of which may have different economic implications. Biomarkers can reveal
useful information about disease diagnosis and prognosis. They can also be used to predict the treatment
efficacy or toxicity of a therapy, serve as markers of disease progression, and can serve as auxiliary (or socalled “surrogate”) endpoints in clinical trials. Further, some biomarkers can be used in more than one
way, while others have just one known role.10
Other work has discussed how different parties in the U.S. health care system are (or are not) incentivized to develop biomarkers – including discovery and establishment (see, for example, Stern, Alexander,
and Chandra, 2018). While all of these applications of biomarkers have the potential to shape the practice
of personalized medicine and may help improve drug development and clinical practice, only a small subset
will have the potential to assist in the development of precision medicines, those therapies targeted at specific
patient populations who are more likely to benefit. For the development of precision medicines, it is useful
to consider which subset of biomarkers are likely to be of value to pharmaceutical innovators in bringing
new therapies to market – either because the use of biomarkers will lead to a higher probability of drug
approval or higher expected profits, given approval. In both cases, these tend to be the types of biomarkers
that can be used for diagnosis and prognosis as well as predictive biomarkers, which are those that can be

Biomarkers come in many types (genomic, proteomic, cellular, biochemical, structural, etc.) and can take on a range of
roles (uses) in both drug development and clinical practice. These are explained below and listed in Tables 2 and 3.

“used to identify individuals who are more likely than similar individuals without the biomarker to experience a favorable or unfavorable effect from exposure to a medical product.” (FDA-NIH, 2016) It is these
latter groups of biomarkers – and the clinical trials driven by their use – that we specifically consider in the
empirical analysis below.
A key opportunity in precision medicine is therapeutic innovation. As we improve our understanding
of the genetic and cellular basis of disease, it will be possible to use genetic and protein biomarkers to
classify patients into increasingly more specific subtypes where specific medicines will be more effective.
In addition, biomarkers that can serve as surrogate endpoints can lead to faster completion of clinical trials,
which may influence decisions about whether to pursue treatments for specific diseases (Budish, Roin, and
Williams 2015). However, the development of drugs that rely on biomarkers can also introduce challenges
to the traditional clinical trial process, such as increased difficulty in trial recruitment due to smaller and
harder-to-find target patient populations. Additionally, trial design and execution can be significantly more
complex when a companion diagnostic (used to measure and/or identify the biomarker itself) needs to be
approved alongside the drug (Fridlyand, et.al 2013). Regardless of the specific application, an increase in
the use of biomarkers has the potential to markedly change the development and approval process for
pharmaceutical innovation.

The drug development pipeline
To describe the drug development pipeline for precision medicines, we characterize all phases of development-oriented clinical trials for new drug candidates over 22 recent years. Clinical trials oriented
towards drug development typically consist of three main phases, which commence following a manufacturer’s successful completion of preclinical studies and submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND)
application. Phase I is primarily designed to assess product safety and appropriate dosage. Phase I trials
run for several months and typically include 20-100 healthy volunteers or individuals with the target disease. Phase II trials are much larger, enrolling up to several hundred individuals with the target disease and
typically lasting between several months to two years. Phase II trials are intended to study drug efficacy
and side effects. Phase III trials – usually the final stage of pre-market clinical research – are the largest,
enrolling anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand individuals with the target disease. These trials
are designed to study clinical efficacy and to monitor and collect data on adverse reactions to new drugs.

7

Sometimes also referred to as “pivotal studies,” Phase III trials typically take 1-4 years to run, but can take
far longer (or shorter) depending on the normal progression of the disease studied.11 Once Phase III results
are available, manufacturers submit a New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application
(BLA) to the FDA that includes the full set of results from the product’s preclinical and clinical studies.
The FDA then has up to 10 months to review the application and determine whether to grant marketing
approval.12

The role of major pharmaceutical R&D actors
Clinical trials can be funded by private companies – both small privately-financed and large publiclylisted organizations – as well as by universities/academic medical centers, and by public actors such as the
NIH. The latter has historically been more focused on early-stage research, with a particular focus on basic
science. 13 This focus stems from the economic role of the NIH as not only the world’s largest funder of
biomedical research (with nearly $32.3 billion invested in 201614), but also a provider of public goods in
the form of investments in basic research.15
How might we expect patterns of investment to differ among LPM trials? LPM trials may be more
innovative and closer to the frontier of biomedical research, a fact that should increase their likelihood of
being supported by a competitive research grant. On the other hand, in many cases, these trials are sponsored by for-profit companies looking to commercialize targeted therapies, which can potentially be sold
at higher prices, making even small markets more financially attractive (Stern, Alexander, and Chandra,

https://www.fda.gov/ForPatients/Approvals/Drugs/ucm405622.htm
In recent decades, the FDA has introduced several expedited approval programs for drugs intended to treat serious
conditions. The “Fast Track” designation allows for frequent meetings with an FDA review team and is for drugs for
which there is evidence of addressing an unmet medical need or treating an infectious disease. The “Breakthrough Therapy” designation is given for drugs that have preliminary clinical evidence indicating substantial improvement over available therapies and guarantees intensive guidance from the FDA as early as Phase I, while also providing several opportunities for expedited and rolling review of results. The “Accelerated Approval” pathway is used for drugs that demonstrate
an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit and provides the potential for approval
based on that surrogate endpoint or an intermediate clinical endpoint. Finally, “Priority Review” requires the FDA to
review marketing applications within six months rather than the standard 10, and is available in a number of circumstances.
https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/Guidances/UCM358301.pdf
13 Therefore, to the extent NIH-funded studies lead to drug development projects, one would expect NIH support to be
more likely to appear in the context of earlier-stage clinical trials.

2017). In this case, private market interest in R&D projects for LPMs may amplify any additional propensity for such projects to receive other sources of funding. Further, as trials target increasingly specific subpopulations of patients, the operational costs and complexity of running clinical trials may increase, either
of which could further shift small companies towards specializing in early-stage R&D activities and letting
larger, more established (e.g. publicly-listed) focus on the final stages of regulatory approval and product
commercialization. We study the role played by large firm actors in the development of LPMs and ask if
these roles have changed over recent decades.

3.! THE ECONOMICS OF PRECISION MEDICINE
As noted above, not all biomarker uses are associated with precision medicines. Here, we outline some
simple economics of precision medicine to better understand how and why biomarkers are important for
understanding the potential future of the pharmaceutical market.
Biomarkers that constitute surrogate endpoints help manufacturers by speeding up clinical trials – e.g.
through the use of the FDA’s accelerated approval process, whereby a product can be approved on the
basis of intermediate patient outcomes that are a good proxy for a therapy’s ultimate effectiveness.16 This
increase in the speed of clinical trials may provide the incentive for pharmaceutical manufacturers to target
drugs for different conditions, thus potentially bringing new innovation to the market (Budish, Roin, and
Williams, 2015). Conditional on approval, however, such drugs may be priced lower because the evidence
base for their approval was less certain.17 For the most part, the effect of the types of biomarkers that can
be used as surrogate trial endpoints has been and is likely to remain limited to changes in the length of the
drug development process (via the ability to run shorter clinical trials).18
In contrast, biomarkers that predict treatment benefit (by defining the subset of patients who are most
appropriate for therapy) can have far-reaching consequences. These include the ability to run faster trials,
since a therapeutic effect will be easier to detect as a result of the greater putative efficacy in the indicated
population, as well as a tendency to change expected market sizes once the frequency of that biomarker in
https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/healthprofessionals/ucm313768.htm
This may be particularly true, for example, in cases where precision medicines are approved based on limited data and/or
surrogate endpoints. Additional evidence substantiating their benefit on actual patient outcomes is likely to be required
before clinicians and health organizations adopt these medications and reimbursement levels are determined (Dzau and
Ginsburg 2016).
18 For a detailed discussion of how the use of surrogate endpoints impacts drug development incentives, see Budish, Roin,
and Williams (2015).

the broader disease population is known. Further, as we have noted elsewhere, such biomarkers could
facilitate indication-based pricing, which could expand access to some patients, but would also mean that
higher prices could be charged for patients with a biomarker that indicates the drug will be more effective
(Chandra and Garthwaite, 2017).
In this setting, biomarkers can facilitate a drug market being segmented into identifiable groups based
on the expected efficacy of the product, and as a result a segmentation of patients by willingness to pay
for the product. When pharmaceutical manufacturers are able to charge only a single price, the existence
of known, distinct patient subgroups would effectively allow firms to choose which patients to serve. For
example, where the population receiving lower (but positive) value is quite large, the manufacturer may
choose to set a low price and sell to a larger market. However, when the lower-value population is quite
small, the manufacturer may instead choose a higher price and forgo sales to those patients who derive the
least value from the product. Economists will note that this represents the classic monopolist’s dilemma,
where pharmaceutical firms trade margins for quantity.
For this reason, firms often attempt to find ways to sell the same product to different customers based
on their valuation – a strategy known as price discrimination. If firms develop a mechanism for charging
indication-based prices, the existence of well-established, readily identifiable biomarkers will become an
important tool for facilitating price discrimination. When such price discrimination is feasible, the most
extreme outcome is that a manufacturer would be able to capture all of the surplus as profits. Depending
on the distribution of patients, this could (but need not) expand access to lower-value indications.
In a world where a product with a biomarker exists, an indication-based pricing strategy weakly increases the profits of firms. As a result, the expanded use of biomarkers has the potential to provide
additional incentives to develop products that would otherwise not be commercialized. The broad contours of this type of price-discrimination are illustrated through a fictional example presented in Appendix
B.19
However, the profit implications of the decision to pursue a biomarker-based product in the first place
is more complicated. First, it is important to note that the assumption that price discrimination is weakly
profit maximizing for an innovator firm is based on the fact that this firm always has the ability to abandon
This figure depicts the monetary value of a hypothetical product for three different indications (for example, patient
populations defined by the presence of biomarkers), the size of the patient populations affected by each indication, and
the prices charged for the product under different pricing regimes.

a price discrimination scheme if it proves to be unprofitable. However, a firm cannot as easily discard
information about the efficacy of a product that is commercialized through a biomarker-driven trial. Thus,
depending on the distribution of customers and the relative efficacy of the drug across sub populations, it
could be that ex post a firm finds that the use of a biomarker as part of its R&D strategy decreases the
profits from a drug compared to a counterfactual where the drug was only priced based on the average
efficacy of the product in the broad patient population (i.e. one where the knowledge from the biomarker
did not exist).
Yet firms must choose whether or not to pursue use of a biomarker for patient selection under some
degree of uncertainty about its likely consequences. As a result, the set of trials that use biomarkers in
pursuit of new therapeutic approvals is likely to be a systemically selected sub-set of the possible trials that
could have used biomarkers for patient selection, as firms make educated guesses about how the use of a
biomarker will affect the size of their eligible patient population and the probability of new product approval – where the two factors are likely to work in opposite directions.
This type of trade-off is not simply a theoretically point; a situation with many of these features has
played-out in recent development projects for PD-1 inhibitors pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and nivolumab
(Opdivo), anti-cancer immunotherapies from Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), respectively.20 BMS
pursued “all-comers” trials for nivolumab – i.e. the firm decided to forego biomarker selection in favor of
broader indications. Merck, however, opted to commercialize pembrolizumab through a series of biomarker-enriched trials (the trials selected for patients with positive PD-L1 expression). Ultimately,
Merck’s drug has been more successful – in part due to a series of blanket approvals by the FDA in mid2017 for patients with any cancer with a specific molecular signature, the FDA’s “first tissue/site agnostic
indication” approval.21 22 Thus, although the use of biomarkers for selection led to a more profitable drug

PD-1 is a checkpoint protein, which prevents a patient’s T-cells from attacking cancer and other cells in the body. PD1 is described as being something like an “off switch,” which binds to PD-L1, a protein that is on both normal and cancer
cells. Monoclonal antibodies can be used therapeutically to bind to either the PD-1 checkpoint protein or PD-L1, preventing binding and allowing the immune system to target cancer cells.

for Merck, it was not clear, ex ante that this would be the case. More generally, personalization may, in
certain cases, ultimately reduce profitability – but not necessarily costs – of some therapies.
Pricing aside, biomarkers that predict treatment efficacy reduce market size, which in turn may reduce
some of the incentives for innovation. At the same time, some biomarkers could allow manufacturers to
more easily qualify for an “orphan drug” designation through the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 (ODA) by
focusing on developing a therapy for a disease sub-population of fewer than 200,000 patients. If a medicine
receives FDA approval for a new drug (a “new molecular entity”) that treats an orphan condition, it receives tax credits equaling 50% of clinical trial expenses and seven years of marketing exclusivity (two years
longer than the standard five years granted for non-orphan drugs). These incentives have been shown to
be powerful: more than 516 medicines for over 450 different rare diseases have been approved through
the ODA,23 and in 2015 alone, 47% of novel drugs approved were orphan drugs.24 When an approval
happens, it will also raise spending and reduce price competition over the medium-term due to the (extended) protections from generic competition offered by the ODA, and the fact that smaller markets will
attract less follow-on competition.25 In particular, in small markets, brand-brand competition will likely be
far less robust than in large markets, as potential entrants see little expected benefit in competing. To some
extent this phenomenon has already been observed in early biosimilar competition in the European Union
(Scott Morton, et al., 2018; Berndt and Trusheim, 2015). Thus, even after exclusivity periods end, there
may not be a large enough market to stimulate price competition through follow-on (i.e. generic or biosimilar) entry.26 As a result, a major shift in new therapeutics towards precision medicines could result in
less price competition through a meaningful decline in the attractiveness of follow-on competition and, as
a result, a meaningful increase in total drug spending.
While conventional wisdom suggests that the use of biomarkers will lead to smaller target markets, we
note, that there are settings in which the use of biomarkers might serve to expand the size of the potential
patient market. This would happen if a drug has side-effects that discourage physicians from using it, but

26 Competition in follow-on drug markets has been discussed by a number of researchers (e.g. Scott Morton, 1999) and in
recent years by Berndt, Conti, and Murphy (2017), Scott Morton, Stern, and Stern (2017), and others. More generally,
larger markets attract more entrants while smaller markets have been shown to attract less competition, all else equal

a biomarker identifies patients who do not suffer these side-effects or in whom the drug is particularly
effective. Such approvals are likely to become more common through the growth and adoption of new
clinical trial designs such as “basket trials.” In a basket trials, patients are enrolled based on a shared mutation, regardless of their disease type – i.e. patients with colon and lung cancer as well as the same mutation
in a particular gene would be included in the same trial (West, 2017). When a certain mutation or protein
expression is relatively common across cancers or autoimmune diseases, biomarker-enriched trials may
ultimately serve to drive additional indications, or faster approvals. Both would increase market-size because manufacturers will not have to seek indications on an individual basis. However, such “market expanding” precision therapies are still relatively rare (notably, the FDA’s first tissue/site agnostic indication
only occurred in 2017). While biomarker-driven market expansion may be important looking ahead, we
expect the LPM development pipeline in the years we study here to mostly be characterized by the types
of products that are likely to shrink rather than expand target patient populations.
Finally, the complexity of developing products in this space combined with the use of new and emerging technologies may result in greater specialization within stages of the drug development process. This
could involve a greater share of products beginning their lifecycle at small, research-focused firms than
would be true in more traditional segments of the pharmaceutical industry.

4.! DATA
We use data from the Cortellis Competitive Intelligence Clinical Trials Database (Cortellis), which is
compiled by Clarivate (and formerly by Thompson Reuters). The database includes over 270,000 global
and U.S.-based clinical trials. Cortellis includes full coverage of 24 clinical trial registries from around the
world, including clinicaltrials.gov, which is maintained by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the
European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT), which is maintained by the European Medicines Agency
(EMA). Biomedical researchers are strongly encouraged to register trials for publication in medical journals
and, as of 2005, trials must be registered to an approved public clinical trial registry prior to patient enrollment in order to be considered for publication in any International Committee of Medical Journal Editors
(ICMJE) member journals (De Angelis, Catherine, et al., 2004).

13

Because both publication and registration are integral parts of the new drug development process, the
set of registered trials included in Cortellis should capture relevant development efforts – in particular, in
the years since 2005, after which time the ICMJE required trial registration in order to publish the results
of clinical trials in member journals.27 Cortellis has full coverage of all ICMJE approved trial registries
(Clinical Trial Registration, 2016) and Cortellis data have been used in several published studies in peer
reviewed biomedical journals such as Lancet Infectious Disease (Phyo, Aung Pyae, et al., 2016) and Nature
Reviews Drug Discovery (Bespalov, Anton, et al., 2016). Appendix C includes a detailed timeline of important dates related to the registration of clinical trials and the establishment of the U.S. clinical trial
registry clinicaltrials.gov.

Data composition and summary statistics
We queried the Cortellis database for all clinical trials with a launch date between January 1, 1995 and
December 31, 2016, for a total of 22 calendar years of clinical trial starts. We identify the full set of known
phase I, II, and III28 clinical trials, along with other detailed information associated with each trial. A few
facts are notable: first, the total number of registered trials worldwide has grown over time for each phase
of clinical research (Figure 1), and in particular for phase II trials.29 In 2016, roughly 6,000 phase II trials
were launched globally, nearly double the number of registered trials launched a decade earlier in 2006.
For each trial, the Cortellis database also provides information on the trial’s intended disease indication(s), any biomarkers used in the trial, and the trial’s sponsors. In addition, we are able to classify trials
according to a broad set of descriptive categories – in particular, the presence (or absence) of one or more
biomarker(s) used in the trial. For each biomarker, we are separately able to categorize its type and use

We believe that coverage of registered trials is comprehensive and we further expect a high share of trials to be registered
in the post-2004 period (De Angelis, Catherine, et al., 2004). However, we note that certain types of trials – e.g. smaller
trials without regulatory oversight – may still be missing in our data. Kao (2017), describes these types of trials and how
they may be designed to signal “off-label usability” to physicians. While an understanding of these types of unregistered
trials is important for understanding pharmaceutical firm strategy, we do not believe they are likely to be the types of trials
that we attempt to identify in this study, which are those specifically intended to commercialize targeted therapies.
28 For the simplest classification of trials into phases, we assign combined trials (e.g. combined Phase II & Phase III) to
the lower of the two phases involved. For example, a combined Phase II/ Phase III trial would be classified as having
started as Phase II in the year that the trial launched. In robustness tests, we create separate sub-categories for combined
Phase I/II and II/III trials and include controls for these combined trials in regression analyses. Subsequent regression
results are not sensitive to this distinction, so we use the simplified 3-phase classification in tables and figures for simplicity.
29 The recent spike in the number of global clinical trials (and Phase II trials in particular) is driven by growth in non-US
trials (see Appendix tables for a version of Figure 1 that presents only U.S. trials).

(role). We also capture key information about the clinical trial’s sponsors. Trial sponsors are identified by
name and type, including academic investigators, government, non-government, company, and other
sponsors. A complete list of the descriptive variables we consider and their frequencies in the clinical trials
data set are provided in Table 1.
To aggregate the detailed indications reported in the Cortellis database into more usable categories, we
used a dataset30 of standardized indications matched to ICD-9 codes to link each trial in our dataset to a
3-digit ICD-9 code. The matched indication-ICD-9 dataset was independently checked for accuracy by
three research assistants using an online ICD-9 medical coding reference manual,31 and any discrepancies
between their matches were resolved by a fourth research assistant. Each indication was ultimately assigned
to one ICD-9 code, corresponding to a total of 65 ICD-9 sub-chapters (listed in Appendix D). Trials with
any indications matching ICD-9 codes 140-239 were classified as cancer trials.
The categorical variable “biomarker type” indicates the biological feature that a given biomarker identifies. Biomarker types include genomic, proteomic, biochemical, cellular, physiological, structural, and anthropomorphic biomarkers. Definitions of biomarker types and their frequencies of use in clinical trials
both a) overall and b) over time are reported in Table 2. Importantly, these types are not mutually exclusive,
since a given biomarker – e.g. a receptor such as EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) – can be both
a genomic and proteomic biomarker. This is because genomic characteristics will lead to differential expression of EGFR, making it a biomarker of particular genomic features, but EGFR is itself a protein and
therefore a proteomic biomarker as well. For this reason, there can be correlation in the presence of biomarkers types across trials.

Biomarker data and defining pipeline precision medicines
The Cortellis data include fairly broad categories of biomarker uses, as they relate to clinical trials.
These include disease markers, toxic effect markers, and therapeutic effect markers. Disease-related biomarkers indicate if a disease already exists (diagnostic biomarker), or how such a disease may develop in
an individual case regardless of the type of treatment (prognostic biomarker). Therapeutic effect-related

We are grateful to Manuel Hermosilla, Craig Garthwaite, and David Dranove, who generously shared their version of a
3-digit ICD-9 crosswalk dataset with us. This dataset was assembled through the use of two independent medical coders
separately constructing a crosswalk. Discrepancies were adjudicated by a third expert and additional outside research.

biomarkers provide an indication of the progress of a product on the patient during treatment. Toxic
effect-related biomarkers indicate a treatment-related adverse reaction. Other biomarker roles are “not
determined” because they do not have any of the roles described above in a particular trial. In practice, we
are interested in a subset of the trials that use disease-related biomarkers – namely, those in which we
observe the unambiguous features of products that would likely come to market as targeted therapeutics
upon successful progression through the R&D process. This is because this subset of biomarkers facilitates
ad hoc patient selection for therapy.
Our working definition of likely precision medicines (LPMs) is that they encompass the set of pipeline
products that are being developed using the types of disease-related biomarkers that are relevant for identifying subpopulations that are likely to be more (or less) responsive to medications. We therefore employ
a second, biomarker-specific database from Clarivate in order to link biomarkers to their detailed roles in
clinical trials. The detailed biomarkers database (DBD) from Clarivate includes additional detail (in the
form of “detailed biomarker roles”) on all known clinical biomarkers and their paired uses and indications
in clinical research. For example, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a (genomic) biomarker that can be used for a) selection for therapy and b) predicting treatment efficacy. In the database,
both of these are included as detailed biomarker roles for using the biomarker HER2 in studies of breast
cancer (the indication). In the Cortellis database, we can then link DBD data as follows: given a trial’s
“breast cancer” indication and knowing that the HER2 biomarker was used in that clinical trial, one can
assign both a biomarker type and a detailed biomarker role (or, in some cases, more than one) to that trial.
In this way, assignment of biomarker roles (from the DBD) to trials (in Cortellis) is achieved via a matching
algorithm that requires a precise match between both the indication and biomarker. For example, in order
to link trail x to biomarker role y, we would match as follows:
trialx + biomarkerBIO + indicationIND !" biomarkerBIO + indicationIND + biomarker roley
where the terms on the left represent variables in the Cortellis database, the terms on the right represent
variables in the DBD, and the underlined terms (indicationIND and biomarkerBIO) are used as exact matching criteria.
Definitions of detailed biomarker roles and the frequencies of their use in clinical trials are reported in
Table 3. A biomarker may have multiple associated uses, making it important to correctly link a biomarker

16

associated with a given clinical trial and indication to its use in that setting. Therefore, the process of matching a biomarker-indication pair from the Cortellis clinical trials data with a biomarker-indication pair from
the DBD is a crucial step in correctly assigning biomarker roles to individual clinical trials. We define LPMs
in two ways using these detailed biomarker roles. These classifications are consistent with the NIH-FDA
definitions of biomarkers and how they are employed.32
In the first, “generous” definition of LPMs, we identify trials using biomarkers whose roles include
diagnosis, differential diagnosis, predicting drug resistance, predicting treatment efficacy, predicting treatment toxicity, screening, and selection for therapy. The rationale for the generous definition is that all of
these biomarkers can be used in the development of targeted therapeutics and are likely to be associated
with the development of precision medicines. In the second, “restrictive” definition of LPMs, we identify
the subset of “generous” trials that specifically employ biomarkers for prediction (these include biomarkers whose
roles include: predicting drug resistance, predicting treatment efficacy, and predicting treatment toxicity),
with the vast majority of these trials identified as LPM trials due to the use of biomarkers that can help
predict treatment efficacy (Table 3). To be clear, both definitions measure likely precision-medicine trials,
but the former, more inclusive definition includes trials in which biomarkers were used to define and select
patient populations for the trial and this role may not fit everyone’s perception of a precision medicine
trial (for example, selecting patients with a certain disease type or patients whose presentation of a biomarker, such a protein, is measured as above/below a cutoff relevant to disease diagnosis).

5.! CHARACTERIZING THE LPM DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE
We characterize the number and type of drugs using biomarkers in their clinical trials as well as those
that can be considered LPMs by therapeutic area and over time. Since cancers represent a set of diseases
in which precision therapies are already successfully used, and since cancer applications of precision medicine are expected to grow in coming years, we separately characterize the cancer applications of pipeline
precision medicines in detail.

The classification definitions were also separately discussed with an oncologist, who at the time of writing was serving
as the principal investigator on a biomarker-driven clinical trial.

32

17

Biomarkers and LPMs in clinical trials
We begin at perhaps the broadest point, by first identifying all trials that use one or more biomarker(s)
of any kind (Figure 2). Notably, both the share and total number of clinical trials employing biomarkers
has increased markedly over recent decades. We next focus only on the subset of trials with biomarker
uses that are associated with LPMs, by both the generous and restrictive definitions (Figure 3). Both the
number and percentage of LPM trials increased over our period of observation, as seen in Figure 3. We
further note that the two definitions of LPMs track each other closely over time – both in Figure 3 as well
as in the subsequent sub-sample analyses described below. Table 4 presents the count (column 1) and
percentage (column 2) of LPMs in clinical trials in each year of our data. Columns 3-8 present the same
results by clinical trial phase. Even by the most restrictive definition of LPM trials, by 2016, approximately
7.5% of trials were for LPMs, roughly double the percentage observed a decade earlier (3.8%).
LPM trials are associated with the use of different types of biomarkers, and the relative and absolute
frequencies of these types have evolved over time. Biomarker types are not mutually exclusive; for example, there is extremely high overlap between proteomic and genomic biomarkers, since the vast majority
of genomic mutations (e.g. in cancer) manifest themselves through differences in protein expression. Figure 4 shows how these types were represented in each phase over our years of observation. Genomic/proteomic biomarkers were the most commonly used in recent years and featured in the vast majority of LPM
trials, a fact that is consistent with LPMs being driven primarily by understanding gene and protein expression and how these factors predict the likely success of medications.

Pipeline precision cancer therapies
Figure 5 and Table 5 present data on the frequency of LPMs in cancer trials only. Several features of
these trials are notable, especially when compared with one another. First, LPM trials are more than an
order of magnitude more common in cancer indications; in 2015 and 2016, roughly 25% (or more) of all
cancer drug trials were LPM trials, but only 1-2% of trials for non-cancer indications were LPM trials. In
regression analysis (Table 8), we also see that a cancer indication is a strong statistical predictor of an LPM
trial and the growth of LPMs among cancer drugs explains the lion’s share of growth in LPM trials over
the past two decades. These results accord with the commonly held belief that the majority of applications
of precision medicines in coming years will be in the context of targeted therapies for cancer.

18

Institutional factors
Next, we consider the LPM development pipeline in light of a number of other institutional factors.
We consider U.S.-based vs. non-U.S.-based trials. The United States is by far the world’s largest pharmaceutical consumer (International Trade Administration, 2016) and it would therefore be reasonable to expect trials for LPMs to be driven to by both local demand (Costinot et al., 2016) as well as local regulations
(FDA, 2004). Figure 6 shows the number and share of U.S. LPM trials. The total number of LPM trials
conducted within the United States is comparable to the total number conducted abroad, but the share of
LPM trials among U.S. trials is roughly double that of international trials. This finding is consistent with
the fact that U.S. drug prices are typically higher than those of other countries (Kanavos et al., 2013),
making it more appealing for pharmaceutical manufacturers to conduct clinical research in order to bring
drugs to market in the United States as soon as possible. These facts are also reflected in our regression
analysis (Table 8) which indicates that U.S. trials are, on average, roughly one percentage point more likely
to involve LPMs at any point in time relative to their non-U.S. counterparts in the same year, all else equal.
Off of a relatively low overall share of LPM trials, this difference represents a double-digit percentage
increase in the likelihood of observing an LPM trial.
In addition, we briefly consider whether LPM trials appear to be related to disease severity.33 We use
the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation’s Global Health Data Exchange to collect data on “global
burden of disease” for all cancers.34 For both the United States (alone) as well as globally, we assemble
data on years of life lost (YLL) due to each cancer.35 For all cancers, we identify the relevant ICD-9 code
and match YLL to the cancer trials in our data (as described above and in the 11 cancer ICD-9 subchapters
presented in Appendix D). Table 6 presents results from two sets of t-tests of differences in means with
unequal variances. We find evidence that among cancer trials, LPM trials are associated with significantly
more U.S. and global YLL for the product’s intended indication than non-LPM trials on average.
Finally, we consider the types of firms – namely publicly listed companies vs. (typically smaller) privately held firms – engaging in the development of LPMs (Figure 7 and Tables 7a and 7b). The correct

35 We use this measure because it is one of the only metrics that has yearly data dating back to the 1990s.

assignment of individual trials to their sponsor firms (and according firm types) is both difficult and fundamental for our analysis. Because acquisitions are common and firm ownership may change over time,
we use imputation to assign each trial in our dataset to the firm that sponsored the trial and its type (e.g.
publicly listed vs. privately held) at the time the trial was launched. Although we are not able to assign these
types with complete accuracy, we are mathematically able to construct upper and lower bounds for whether
each sponsor firm was publicly listed at the time of a trial. Aggregating our data, we are able to construct
upper and lower bounds for the share of publicly listed firms over time and across phases (Figure 7). Appendix E presents details how these bounds were calculated and a short proof of the bounding exercise.
Overall, we find that publicly listed firms are significantly more likely to pursue LPM trials, regardless of
whether we use the upper or lower bound for the measure for whether or not a firm was (already) publicly
listed at the time of a given trial’s launch.
We conclude with regression analyses (Tables 8-9).36 We are circumspect in interpreting our regression
results; the coefficients calculated are not causally estimated; rather they represent differences between
categories in our sample, controlling for other factors. However, the coefficients are useful in that they
allow for interpretation of multivariate associations. Tables 8a and 8b present linear probability models
using facets of trials to predict the likelihood that any given trial is an LPM using the generous and restrictive definitions as binary outcomes, respectively.
Through both panels, a set of statistical relationships emerge. For example, the linear probability models presented in Tables 8a-8b indicate that the total share of LPM trials has been increasing over time by
between 0.3 and 0.5 percentage points per year, with slightly higher point estimates from models focusing
on the most recent 12 years of data only. We also find that precision-trials are likely to be spread across all
phases of trial development (it’s not the case that they are significantly less common in later phases relative
to their frequency in Phase I trials). Other relationships seen in the trends presented in earlier tables and
figures are also apparent: most prominent among these is the importance of cancer trials; trials for cancer
indications are 13-15 percentage points more likely to be LPM trials than those for non-cancer indications.

As noted above, in our analyses we assign combined trials (e.g. combined Phase II & Phase III) to the lower of the two
phases involved. In robustness tests, we create separate sub-categories for combined Phase I/II and II/III trials and
include controls for these combined trials in regression analyses. Results are not sensitive to this distinction, so we use the
more parsimonious 3-phase classification in tables and figures for simplicity.

36

20

Off of an average share of LPM trials that only first reached 10% in recent years, this means that conditional on having a cancer trail, the probability that the trial is for an LPM more than doubles. Indeed, the
coefficient on the binary indicator for whether a trial is a cancer trial is an order of magnitude larger than
the association between time, location, trial phase or firm type. Trials with U.S. sites are more likely than
non-U.S. trials to be LPM trials, but only by about one percentage point – in other words, comparing this
result to the overall time trend in the data, U.S. trials seem to be about 2-3 years “ahead” of non-U.S. trials
in their inclusion of LPMs. We also find that the role of publicly listed firms is similar in magnitude and
direction; trials pursued by publicly listed firms are 1-2 percentage points more likely to be LPM trials than
those of privately held firms, all else equal.
We conclude our regression analysis by briefly considering predictors of trial duration. One implication
of precision medicine is that trials themselves can be conducted more efficiently, if effect sizes are expected
to be large. Efficiency improvements could occur on the dimension of enrollment (fewer patients required)
or on the dimension of trial duration (less time needed to draw statistically sound evidence); we consider
only the latter possibility here. Table 9 presents results from a set of linear regression models predicting
trial duration. These models include a number of trial features as regressors and present multivariate associations in our dataset. As above, these coefficients cannot be interpreted causally; rather, they represent
average associations between features of clinical trials and the amount of time required for trial completion.
The first three columns of Table 9 present models predicting trial duration in LPM trials, while the
last three columns present identical models in non-LPM trials. A number of interesting differences emerge.
First, we note the difference in the coefficient on the intercept in the two sets of linear models; LPM trials
take roughly 20 months longer to complete relative to non-precision trials, all else equal. This may be due
to the challenges of enrolling patients with less common sub-types of a disease as well as the fact that nonprecision trials include a number of shorter studies (e.g. for antibiotics) that can be run extremely quickly,
thereby lowering the average time to completion in the second group of trials. As in Table 8, phase I trials
are the omitted category in all models. For LPM trials, phase II trials are, all else equal, only about two
months longer than phase I trials, on average, and this differences is not statistically significant in any of
the three specifications. This is quite different than what is observed in non-precision trials, where phase
II studies take 5-6 months longer than phase I studies to complete. Among LPM trials, phase III studies
have durations over a year longer than their phase I and phase II counterparts, a bigger difference than

21

among non-precision trials, where phase III studies are only 7-9 months longer on average. This suggests
that although LPM trials may be longer on average, the use of biomarkers may be able to close the gap
between Phase 1 and later phases to some extent.
Interestingly, although cancer trials appear to always take longer to complete on average than noncancer trials, the additional trial length associated with LPM cancer trials is 6-7 months less than the additional trial length associated with non-precision cancer trials in these models. One interpretation of this is
that precision medicines perhaps speed up cancer trials because of surrogate endpoints or enrichment. We
are cautious not to o ver-interpretation this relationship, because it does not hold up when examined in
further detail; in Appendix Table III we consider the same sets of models for cancer trials alone and show
similar patterns across many coefficients in the regression models, but differences in the estimated constants between LPM trials vs. non-precision trials in cancer. Finally, we note that as economic incentives
would predict, trials sponsored by publicly listed firms have shorter durations, on average (e.g. such firms
are likely under pressure from investors to bring products to market). While none of these facts provide
conclusive evidence on the causes of differences in trial length, the associations are intriguing and suggest
the value of future research into the determinants of clinical trial length – especially since clinical trials
represent a significant component of both the time and financial cost associated with new drug development.

6.! CONCLUSION
By taking a detailed view of the global clinical trial pipeline over recent decades, we are able to describe
a number of trends and industry-level changes. Beyond growth in the number of registered clinical trials,
we document a number of patterns that have implications for cost-growth in health care and pharmaceutical pricing. First, we show that the use of biomarkers in clinical trials has grown significantly, with an
important subset representing the types of biomarkers that have the potential to be used in the development of targeted therapies. Such therapies are likely to be more effective, but will also frequently come
with higher prices. Although the raw numbers of trials using biomarkers in the development of precision
medicines is still dwarfed by the total number of clinical trials for new therapeutics, the growth in likely

22

precision medicine trials has been large in percentage terms, approximately doubling every decade over the
past 22 years.
Our results should be interpreted with a number of caveats. Firstly, the findings presented here are
only as representative as the global registries on which our primary clinical trial dataset is based. While we
have noted above that there are good reasons to believe that these registries are representative of the set
of pipeline drugs pursuing regulatory approvals in the dozen most recent years of our data, there may be
more selection in trial reporting in earlier years. In particular, we believe that the data in the years after
2004 are more likely to capture most clinical trials conducted in pursuit of new product approvals, due to
changes in trial registration requirements for academic journal publication (discussed above). Unfortunately, we do not have tractable a way of estimating the type and direction of selection into trial registries
that may have occurred.
Secondly, we note that our characterization of trials as either LPM or non-LPM trials is, by nature,
probabilistic, based on observable features of these trials and the biomarkers employed in them. While the
categories we use are unambiguously more conservative than simply considering any use of biomarkers in
clinical trials, they may still capture some trials and pipeline products that do not, in fact, represent precision medicines.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we have characterized the drug development pipeline, which is
not necessarily synonymous with characterizing the actual set of products that are subsequently commercialized. If failure rates in clinical research are endogenously determined with other characteristics related to
commercialization strategies (e.g. single-product vs. multi-product firms, as seen in Guedj and Scharfstein,
2004), characterizing trials may not accurately reflect the future products that emerge from those trials. To
the extent that there is selection in R&D project discontinuations based on features that are not included
in our analysis, the set of products that ultimately comes to market may look different than the late-stage
clinical trial pipeline would suggest.37
Yet we believe that we have also made progress in characterizing recent trends and developments in
clinical research related to precision medicines. By taking a big-picture view of global clinical trials, we can
observe how trials for LPMs have grown in number and share over recent decades. We can also bring
On average, the success rate for a drug entering clinical trials is approximately 10%. This rate is even lower for oncology therapeutics, at roughly 5%. (https://www.bio.org/sites/default/files/Clinical%20Development%20Success%20Rates%202006-2015%20-%20BIO,%20Biomedtracker,%20Amplion%202016.pdf)

empirical data to bear on predictions from medicine and economics, which would suggest that certain
types of drugs (e.g. for cancers) and certain markets (e.g. in the United Sates) are likely to have a greater
share of LPMs. Within LPMs, we see a large and growing share of products that incorporate genomic and
proteomic biomarkers in their development, suggesting the growing importance of sequencing technologies for both R&D and patient care. Further, recent trajectories have implications for health care spending;
to the extent that precision medicines grow in market share, they will drive up costs for many of the drugs
that target specific groups of patients and also open up opportunities for previously difficult-to-implement
firm strategies such as indication-based pricing. Such developments will also underscore the impact of
strategic decisions regarding when and how to run biomarker-driven clinical trials during the therapeutic
development process.

Biomarker types:
Anthropomorphic biomarkers are markers of the body shape/form
Biochemical biomarkers are substrates or products of chemical reactions in the body
Cellular biomarkers are whole cells
Genomic biomarkers are variants in the DNA sequence or in the transcription level;
Physiological biomarkers are body processes
Proteomic biomarkers are variants in protein sequence, protein levels in a given tissue, protein interactions and enzyme activities
Structural biomarkers are anatomical structures

Biomarker roles (uses) that are related to the development of LPMs, generously defined, are included above
The restrictive definition of LPMs limits the definition to those related only to prediction: predicting
drug resistance, treatment efficacy, and treatment toxicity and is driven by “predicting treatment efficacy.”
Biomarker roles (uses) that are unrelated to developing LPMs, but included in the data are: disease profiling,
monitoring disease progression, monitoring treatment efficacy, monitoring treatment toxicity, prognosis,
prognosis - risk stratification, risk factor, staging, and toxicity profiling

APPENDIX A
This table lists the formal definition of different biomarker types as defined by the FDA-NIH Biomarker Working group (2016)
Biomarker type
Diagnostic
Biomarker

Official definition
A biomarker used to detect or confirm
presence of a disease or condition of interest or to identify individuals with a subtype
of the disease.

Examples
1)! Sweat chloride may be used as a diagnostic biomarker to confirm cystic fibrosis (Farrell et al.
2008).
2)! Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may be used as a diagnostic biomarker to identify patients with chronic
kidney disease (National Kidney Foundation 2002).

Monitoring
Biomarker

A biomarker measured serially for assessing
status of a disease or medical condition or
for evidence of exposure to (or effect of) a
medical product or an environmental agent.

1)! HIV-RNA may be used as a monitoring biomarker
to measure and guide treatment with antiretroviral
therapy (ART) (AIDSinfo 2007).
2)! Serial measurements of symphysis-fundal height during pregnancy can be used during antenatal screening
to detect fetal growth disturbances (Papageorghiou et
al. 2016).

Pharmacodynamic /
Response Biomarker

A biomarker used to show that a biological
response has occurred in an individual who
has been exposed to a medical product or
an environmental agent.

1)! Circulating B lymphocytes may be used as a pharmacodynamic/response biomarker when evaluating patients with systemic lupus erythematosus to assess response to a B-lymphocyte stimulator inhibitor (Stohl
and Hilbert 2012).
2)! Urinary level of glycosaminoglycans may be used as a
pharmacodynamic/response biomarker when evaluating the effect of enzyme replacement therapy for
patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type 1 (Jameson
et al. 2016).

Predictive
Biomarker

A biomarker used to identify individuals
who are more likely than similar individuals
without the biomarker to experience a favorable or unfavorable effect from exposure to a medical product or an environmental agent.

1)! Certain cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
regulator (CFTR) mutations may be used as predictive biomarkers in clinical trials evaluating treatment
for cystic fibrosis, to select patients more likely to respond to particular treatments (Davies et al. 2013).
2)! Human leukocyte antigen allele (HLA)–B*5701 genotype may be used as a predictive biomarker to evaluate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients
before abacavir treatment, to identify patients at risk
for severe skin reactions (AIDSinfo 2007).

Prognostic
Biomarker

A biomarker used to identify likelihood of a
clinical event, disease recurrence or progression in patients who have the disease or
medical condition of interest.

1)! Breast Cancer genes 1 and 2 (BRCA1/2) mutations
may be used as prognostic biomarkers when evaluating women with breast cancer, to assess the likelihood of a second breast cancer (Basu et al. 2015).
2)! Gleason score may be used as a prognostic biomarker when evaluating patients with prostate cancer to assess the likelihood of cancer progression
(Epstein et al. 2016; Gordetsky and Epstein 2016).

Safety
Biomarker

A biomarker measured before or after an
exposure to a medical product or an environmental agent to indicate the likelihood,

1)! Hepatic aminotransferases and bilirubin may be used
as safety biomarkers when evaluating potential hepatotoxicity (Senior 2014).

i

Susceptibility / Risk
Biomarker:

presence, or extent of toxicity as an adverse
effect.

2)! Serum creatinine may be used as a safety biomarker
when evaluating patients on drugs that affect kidney
function to monitor for nephrotoxicity (Wasung et
al. 2015).

A biomarker that indicates the potential for
developing a disease or medical condition
in an individual who does not currently
have clinically apparent disease or the medical condition.

1)! Factor V Leiden may be used as a susceptibility/risk
biomarker to identify individuals with a predisposition to develop deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (Kujovich 2011).
2)! Infection with certain human papillomavirus (HPV)
subtypes may be used as a susceptibility/risk biomarker to identify individuals with a predisposition
to develop cervical cancer (Khan et al. 2005; Schiffman et al. 2011).

Note: Some examples of biomarkers cited in this appendix may be applicable for more than one type of
biomarker. For example, in some cases, predictive biomarkers used to identify individuals who are more
likely to experience a favorable effect from a drug can also be used as diagnostic biomarkers in the initial
detection or confirmation of the disease (e.g. CFTR mutations in Cystic Fibrosis).

APPENDIX B

Effects'of'Uniform'Pricing'versus'Indication=Based'Pricing.

Effects of uniform pricing versus indication-based pricing.

From Chandra, A. and Garthwaite, C. “The Economics of Indication-Based Drug Pricing.” New England Journal of Medicine,
377(2), pp.103-106. Copyright © (2017) Massachusetts Medical Society. Reprinted with permission.
http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1705035
Chandra'A,'Garthwaite'C.'N'Engl'J'Med'2017:377:103=106.

In Panel A, the upper graph represents a uniform-pricing context in which patients with indication A
receive the most benefit and those with indication C receive the least. The population with indication C is
large, and the value of treatment to this group is close to the value for indication B. As a result, the manufacturer’s profit-maximizing price allows all patients to obtain the drug. At this price, the manufacturer
earns profits, represented by the green area. However, the firm faces a trade-off. By setting the price in
this way, the manufacturer forgoes profits that could be earned by charging higher prices to patients with
indications A and B. These forgone profits, represented by the blue areas, are captured by these patients
as consumer surplus — the value difference between the most consumers are willing to pay and what they
actually pay.
The lower graph in Panel A shows a different scenario, in which the product’s valuation for patients with
indication C is very low. In this case, it’s a better trade-off for the manufacturer to set a high price, at
which it knows the payer will allow only patients with indications A and B to obtain the drug. The manufacturer accepts the loss of sales to patients with indication C in exchange for higher profits earned from
patients with indications A and B. Comparing these graphs, we see that when the valuation of the product for indication C is relatively low, manufacturers set a higher uniform price, the payer curtails sales to
patients with indication C (orange area), and patients with indications A and B obtain less consumer surplus than they did in the first scenario.

iii

Panel B of the graph represents the same set scenarios with respect to the distribution of patients and
valuations but allows for indication-based pricing by the manufacturer. The scenario presented is an extreme example in which a monopoly provider is able to set the price exactly at the willingness to pay of
the consumer population and thus capture all of the surplus. For scenario 1, the same sets of patients are
served but the manufacturer is now able to capture all of the surplus. Scenario 2 represents an output
expanding scenario where the manufacturer now finds it profitable to sell to patients with indication C,
while also raising the price on the indication A patients that receive the most value from the drug. In total, the introduction of indication-based pricing is shown to weakly increase prices, profits, and the quantity sold.

Selected Explanation as provided by the Website of ClinicalTrials.gov (2017):
1997: Congress Passes Law (FDAMA) Requiring Trial Registration
The first U.S. Federal law to require trial registration was the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA) (PDF). Section 113 of FDAMA required the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) to create a public information resource on certain clinical trials regulated by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)
2000: NIH Releases ClinicalTrials.gov Web Site
The first version of ClinicalTrials.gov was made available to the public on February 29, 2000. At the time,
ClinicalTrials.gov primarily included NIH-funded studies.
2000–2004: FDA Issues Guidance for Industry Documents
In 2000 FDA issued a draft Guidance for Industry document, which provided recommendations for researchers submitting information to ClinicalTrials.gov. A final guidance document that incorporated comments from the public was issued in 2002.
2004: ClinicalTrials.gov Wins the Innovations in American Government Award
The Innovations in American Government Awards program highlights exemplary models of government
innovation and advances efforts to address the Nation's most pressing public concerns.
2005: International Committee of Medical Journal Editors Requires Trial Registration
In 2005 the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) began requiring trial registration
as a condition of publication.
2005: State of Maine Passes Clinical Studies Registration Law (Repealed in 2011)
In 2005 the State of Maine passed a law requiring prescription drug manufacturers or labelers to submit
clinical study registration and results information to ClinicalTrials.gov. In 2011 the law was repealed; it is
no longer in effect.
2006: World Health Organization Establishes Trial Registration Policy
In 2006 the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that all clinical trials should be registered, and it
identified a minimum trial registration dataset of 20 items and in 2007 launched the International Clinical
Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).
2007: Congress Passes Law (FDAAA) Expanding ClinicalTrials.gov Submission Requirements
In 2007 the requirements for submission to ClinicalTrials.gov were expanded after Congress passed the
Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA). Section 801 of FDAAA (FDAAA
801) required more types of trials to be registered; additional trial registration information; and the submission of summary results, including adverse events, for certain trials. The law also included penalties for
noncompliance, such as the withholding of NIH grant funding and civil monetary penalties of up to
$10,000 a day.
2008: ClinicalTrials.gov Releases Results Database
In September 2008, as required by FDAAA 801, ClinicalTrials.gov began allowing sponsors and principal
investigators to submit the results of clinical studies.38

The submission of adverse event information was optional when the results database was released but was required
beginning in September 2009.

2008: Declaration of Helsinki Revision Promotes Trial Registration and Results Dissemination
In October, 2008 the 59th World Medical Association (WMA) General Assembly amended the Declaration of Helsinki - Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects. Two newly added
principles (paragraphs 19 and 30) considered the prospective registration and the public disclosure of study
results to be ethical obligations.
2009: Public Meeting Held at the National Institutes of Health
In accordance with FDAAA 801, NIH held a public meeting in April 2009 to solicit input from interested
individuals about future regulations that will expand the information on ClinicalTrials.gov.
2013: European Medicines Agency Expands Clinical Trial Database to Include Summary Results
In October 2013 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) released a new version of the European Clinical
Trials Database (EudraCT). Notably, the EudraCT summary results data requirements are "substantially
aligned" with those of the ClinicalTrials.gov results database.
2014: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for FDAAA 801 Issued for Public Comment
In November 2014 the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) describing the proposed requirements and procedures for registering and submitting the
results, including adverse events, of clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov, in accordance with FDAAA 801.
2014: NIH Draft Policy on Registration and Results Submission of NIH-Funded Clinical Trials
Issued for Public Comment.
In November 2014 NIH proposed a policy to ensure that every clinical trial (see the Revised NIH Definition of "Clinical Trial") that receives NIH funding is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov and has summary
results submitted and posted in a timely manner, whether subject to FDAAA 801 or not.
2015: National Cancer Institute Issues Clinical Trial Access Policy
In January, 2015 the NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) issued its Policy Ensuring Public Availability
of Results from NCI-supported Clinical Trials. The policy states, "Final Trial Results are expected to be
reported in a publicly accessible manner within twelve (12) months of the Trial's Primary Completion Date
regardless of whether the clinical trial was completed as planned or terminated earlier."
2016: Final Rule for FDAAA 801 Issued
In September 2016, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a Final Rule for Clinical
Trials Registration and Results Information Submission (42 CFR Part 11) that clarifies and expands the
regulatory requirements and procedures for submitting registration and summary results information of
clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov, in accordance with FDAAA 801. The final rule is intended to make it
clear to sponsors, investigators, and the public which trials must be submitted, when they must be submitted, and whether compliance has been achieved.
2016: Final NIH Policy on the Dissemination of NIH-funded Clinical Trial Information Issued
In September 2016, NIH issued a final policy to promote broad and responsible dissemination of information from NIH-funded clinical trials through ClinicalTrials.gov. Under this policy, every clinical trial
funded in whole or in part by NIH is expected to be registered on ClinicalTrials.gov and have summary
results information submitted and posted in a timely manner, whether subject to FDAAA 801 or not.

APPENDIX E
Identifying publicly listed firms
In order to understand the “lineage” (ownership histories) of firms, we take advantage of data on a
firm’s “Ancestor” as provided by the Thompson Reuters Permanent Identifier (“PermID”) database.
Thompson Reuters describes the database as “a machine-readable identifier developed to create a unique
reference for any data item” noting that a “PermID provides comprehensive identification across a wide
variety of entity types including organizations, instruments, funds, issuers and people.”39 We match firms
in the Cortellis data to the firms’ PermIDs: 90.0% of the companies in the Cortellis database have PermID
information (137,160 out of 152,357). Of the137,160 companies with PermIDs we matched 99.2% of
them with the PermID data. This results in firm-specific data on whether or not a firm is publicly listed.
The same database also allows us to observe if a firm has been acquired by a publicly listed firm (“ancestor”). Based on a combination of trial date (from Cortellis) and acquisition data (from the PermID database), we can understand whether a trial was sponsored by a publicly listed firm (and/) or whether or not
the sponsor was a subsidiary of a publicly listed firm.
As a result of the data considerations described below, we assign upper and lower-bound measures of
whether or not a firm was publicly listed at the time of an observed clinical trial as follows.

We use ancestor firms’ public status instead of firms’ (own) public status assigning legitimate subsidiaries to their parent company’s status as wanted (Row 2); however, this method also assigns some acquired
firms to an incorrect status.
In Row 3 above, Small Bio Corp. conducts a trial as a privately owned firm at time 0 and is acquired
by GSK at time t > 0. Due to data limitations we observe only the most recent firm ancestor (GSK) at
time of data collection T > t > 0, and thus the ancestor’s public status at time T (TRUE) misrepresents
Small Bio’s status on the trial date. This is not an issue for firms that were publicly traded before being
acquired as long as the acquiring firm is public as well (as in the example in Row 4). This is, however, a
complication for firms that were publicly traded and then “delisted” after being purchased by a private
firm (as in the example in Row 5).
Rarely, firms are listed as public with non-publicly traded ancestors. This generally indicates partial
private ownership of a public firm (as in the example in Row 6).
None of the measures of !"#$%&+ |+∈(,),* match the unobserved true public status (!"#$%&' ) for each
case, but they can still be useful in a bounding exercise. Because !"#$%&( is never TRUE in any case that
!"#$%&' is FALSE, it can be used as a lower bound for !"#$%&' .
Measure 3 is NOT an upper bound on Measure 0 because, as is the case with Xenoport,
!"#$%&' = 0123 does not imply !"#$%&* = 0123. However, the true share of trials run by public firms
will be bounded above by Measure 3 share as long as there are more trials misclassified as public (due to a
later acquisition) than misclassified as private. This is proven below:

4ℎ6789!"#$%&*
=9

#!"#$%&907%6$; + #=%;&$6;;%>%8?@ABCDEF→@HIJBK − #=%;&$6;;%>%8?@HIJBK→@ABCDEF

xii

4ℎ6789!"#$%&* >

#!"#$%&907%6$;
= 9 4ℎ6789!"#$%&'
#07%6$;

So in this case, 4ℎ6789!"#$%&* is an upper bound on the true share of trials funded by public firms.
We cannot directly measure the number of misclassified trials to test whether this assumption holds,
but because these misclassifications result from mergers and acquisitions, public firms acquiring private
firms will likely make up the lion’s share of such activity and the bound will hold.
The process by which we calculate dummy variables indicating whether a trial is public by the different
measures is outlined below:
1.! For each firm
a.! !"#$%&( = O >%7P9%;9Q"#$%&9%R92017 ;
b.! !"#$%&) = O(>%7P Y ;96R&8;Z[79%;9Q"#$%&9%R92017)
2.! For each trial and firm recode
a.! !"#$%&( = 09%>9M!]9^6Z8 > 07%6$9^6Z8.
b.! !"#$%&) = 09%>9_R&8;Z[79M!]9^6Z8 > 07%6$9^6Z8.
3.! For each firm-ancestor pair calculate !"#$%&* = max9{!"#$%&( , !"#$%&) }.
4.! For each trial, calculate whether any public firms were involved with the trial:
a.! !"#$%&907%6$9( = max

!"#$%&(+ : f ∈ g 99

b.! !"#$%&907%6$9* = 9 max

!"#$%&*+ : f ∈ g 9
