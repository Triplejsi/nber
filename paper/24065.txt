Leaving Money on the Table? Suboptimal Enrollment in the New Social Pension Program

ABSTRACT
China’s recently implemented New Rural Pension Scheme (NRPS), the largest social pension
program in the world, was designed to provide financial protection for its rural population and
reduce economic inequities. Yet the impact of this program is mitigated if those eligible fail to
enroll. This paper examines the extent to which pension-eligible individuals, and their families,
make optimal pension decisions. Families are involved in the NRPS decisions because, in most
cases, adult children need to enroll as a prerequisite of their parents’ receipt of benefits. We
examine the decisions of both those eligible for pension benefits (i.e. over 60 years old) and their
adult children. We use the rural sample of the 2012 China Family Panel Study to study
determinants of the decision to enroll in NRPS, premiums paid, and time taken to enroll. We find
evidence of low and suboptimal pension enrollment by eligible individuals and their families.
Suboptimal enrollment takes various forms including failure to switch from the dominated default
pension program to NRPS and little evidence that families make mutually beneficial intra-family
decisions. For the older cohort, few individual and family characteristics are significant in
enrollment decisions, but village characteristics play an important role. For the younger cohort,
we find that more individual-level characteristics are significant, including own and children’s
education. Village characteristics are important but not as much as for the older cohort.

1. Introduction
In 2009, China introduced to its rural population the world’s largest social pension,
the New Rural Pension Scheme (NRPS). This covered population tends to be of lower
education and to have lower income and worse health than its urban counterpart. The
NRPS was designed to provide the rural elderly, especially those with low income, with
basic protection against poverty in old age. The NRPS was also introduced in part due
to erosion of the traditional system of intergenerational cohabitation, in which children
would provide in-person care for elderly family members and share incomes. The lower
rates of cohabitation with children are due to both the large outmigration of younger
generations and the persistent decline in the fertility rate. Consequently, the elderly
currently need more market-based services to substitute for the lack of in-person family
care. The increased life expectancy in China leaves the elderly living alone for more
years.2 Thus, many rural elderly are increasingly likely to suffer from too little support
without the rural pension system. However, without a high uptake of NRPS, protection
will remain low.
The NRPS was also launched to replace the failed, unsubsidized rural pension
program initiated in the 1990s, i.e. the Old Rural Pension Scheme (ORPS). In contrast
to ORPS, both the central and local governments generously subsidize the NRPS. The
subsidy is particularly robust for those in the special phase-in period at program
initiation, allowing elderly persons at the time of local rollout to receive benefits despite
never having paid into the system. This special phase-in period provides an important
opportunity to study enrollment decisions.
We use the 2012 China Family Panel Study (CFPS) to explore determinants of the
decision to enroll in NRPS, premiums paid, and time to enrollment. This paper
empirically investigates the extent to which people are responding to the new pension
program with optimal financial decisions. To the extent that they do not respond
optimally, we also examine who fails to enroll, and why. Specifically, we examine the
economic incentives to enroll and factors that could directly and indirectly affect
enrollment decisions. The rollout of the program to all counties in China prior to the
2012 survey provides us with the opportunity to observe our three outcome variables
the: decision to enroll, timing of enrollment, and size of individual premium
contribution. We examine these decisions both for those eligible for a pension and their
adult children. We focus on the latter due to the requirement that children need to enroll
to make their elderly parents eligible for NRPS, and because they may also have their
own motivations to enroll for their futures.
The Family Binding Policy in China requires at least one child (aged 16 years or
above, not enrolled in school, and holding rural registration) to enroll in the NRPS to
make their elderly parents eligible for pension benefits. Note that a large proportion of
elderly parents have multiple children due to the loosely implemented One Child Policy
in rural China. The enrolling adult child must pay premiums each year for his or her
parents to receive pension payments. We examine separately the incentives and
decisions of those over and under the age of 60, due to this important policy and other
By 2050, 32.8 percent of China’s population will be above age 60, which will be the largest in size in
the world (United Nations 2013).

differences in coverage and contribution requirements by age. Specifically, we
separately examine individuals over age 60 who have children, and also those between
the ages of 45 and 60. We ignore those under 45 as they have little incentive to enroll
until later in life, even with the binding policy. People older than age 60 have
straightforward incentives to enroll in NPRS as it is noncontributory for this initial
cohort of the elderly. The decisions of people aged 45–60 are more complicated, for
several reasons. Importantly, their decision to enroll may be affected by the desire to
ensure benefits for their parents. If they choose to enroll, they also must decide when
to enroll, and at what level of premiums.
We find that only half of the small percentage of childless seniors who could
benefit immediately without being subject to the Family Binding Policy enroll. Children
and their elderly parents could make simple arrangements to enroll, and have immediate
pension benefits to both generations, but many fail to do so, thus leaving money ‘on the
table’. Moreover, a sizable portion of respondents could obtain higher benefits simply
by switching from the unsubsidized ORPS (the default program) to the highly
subsidized NRPS, but again fail to do so. Surprisingly, although the poorest households
(in the bottom quintile) are more likely to enroll as compared to their richer counterparts,
those in the next lowest quintiles are not more likely to enroll. And none of the lowest
quintiles enroll more rapidly despite presumably having more to gain in terms of
improvement in their well-being.
Our empirical investigation has several notable strengths. First, we contribute to
the literature by making the first attempt to examine suboptimal pension enrollment and
exploring plausible explanations to the puzzle of low pension enrollment and, more
generally, inadequate planning for old age3. Second, we contribute to the literature by
examining intra-family and intergenerational arrangements as they are key to optimal
pension decisions. Our ability to link older parents and children (even those who have
migrated) enables us to observe intra-family dynamics. Third, because the 2012 CFPS
survey was fielded on average two years after the implementation of NRPS, we are able
to compare the actual enrollment to some clear-cut gains to enrollment that occurred in
the initial rollout. In this post-enrollment period, respondents would have had ample
time to make decisions. Further, we collect and match county administrative data on
pension roll-out with individual’s pension choices to obtain precisely measured pension
enrollment decisions.
Another contribution of this paper is that while most of the literature on pension
decisions relates to the developed world, this paper examines pension decisions in a
middle-income country. As the country with the world’s largest population and pension
system, China’s experience demands analysis. In addition, the program is growing
For example, people often fail to plan adequately for retirement. A sizable fraction of those close to
retirement age do not plan for retirement (Lusardi 1999) or make adjustments to consumption and saving
(Hubbard et al. 2005); this holds even among respondents with high educational attainment (Ameriks et
al. 2003). Employees fail to enroll in a timely manner and fail to obtain the maximum payouts (Campbell
2006; Chalmers et al. 2014). Also, people are uninformed about the characteristics of their pension plans
(Mitchell 1988; Gustman and Steinmeier 2001), respond to the complexity inherent in retirement plan
choices by simply choosing the default option (Madrian and Shea 2001; Clark et al. 2015), and leave
“$100 bills on the sidewalk” by declining matching retirement contributions that can be immediately
withdrawn (Choi et al. 2011).

dramatically as China is currently integrating rural and urban social pensions. Once
completed, this unified pension system may serve more than 800 million residents,
doubling the current size of the NRPS (Chen 2016). Thus, lessons learned from analysis
of the NPRS have an immediate application.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides institutional
background on the New Rural Pension Scheme. Section 3 discusses the conceptual
framework, provides predictions about optimal enrollment decisions, and explains the
empirical methods. Section 4 introduces the dataset and the analytical sample. Section
5 discusses the empirical results. Section 6 concludes and discusses potential
explanations and policy implications.
2. Institutional Background: The New Rural Pension Scheme in China
Despite rapid overall economic growth in China, income growth in rural areas has
not matched that of urban areas. NRPS was launched to help address this geographical
inequity and to protect rural populations against poverty in old age. Officially launched
in September 2009, after a few years of piloting in selected areas of the country, the
NRPS was to replace ORPS, an older and unsuccessful rural pension program
implemented in the 1990s. Since 2009, ORPS has remained in operation but not
accepted new enrollees. The two programs are mutually exclusive in enrollment but
existing ORPS clients can simply transfer their contributed premiums to the NRPS. In
contrast to ORPS, NRPS is subsidized at both provincial and national levels. By 2012,
the NRPS had been introduced into all counties of China, thus making more than 400
million eligible for enrollment and providing the potential for nationwide, subsidized
old-age support to rural China’s elderly population (see Appendix Figure 1). Yet, about
17 percent of those over age 45 (i.e. 12 percent of those aged 45–60 and 24 percent of
those over 60) have not switched from ORPS to NRPS, though NRPS clearly dominates
ORPS (Table 1 and Appendix Figure 2).4
All residents with rural registration (Hukou), aged 16 or above and not in school,
can voluntarily enroll in NRPS. No cumulative work histories are required5. Individuals
aged 16–60 at the time of the rollout can establish and contribute to private accounts at
varying levels. Such private accounts are funded by and eventually paid to the
individual and can be inherited at death. However, those of 60 or over at the time of the
local rollout did not have the opportunity to establish private accounts.
Those over age 60 at the time of the rollout were not required to have contributed
to the pension system to be eligible for basic pension benefits. However, the Family
Binding Policy stipulates that they are eligible for basic pension benefits only if at least
one of their adult children eligible for the NRPS also enrolls. If there is no such adult
child, the parent is eligible for benefits by default. People aged between 45 and 60 can
contribute for any time period before age 60 to be eligible for pension benefits.6 For
Note that even if all were to switch to NRPS, 30 percent of the younger cohort and 20 percent of the
older cohort would not have enrolled in NRPS.
5 The lack of a contribution requirement perhaps occurs in part because most rural residents work in
the informal sector, with no formal documentation of work contribution.
6
In order to support the financial stability of NPRS, the government recommends that those aged 45–
60 contribute as much as possible to NRPS, although there is no financial incentive for them to do so.

individuals aged 16–44 at rollout, contributions must have been made into the system
for at least 15 years before benefits can be received at age 60.
The lowest level of pension premium paid by an individual is 100 CNY per year
per person, but wealthier provinces often set higher premium levels, and consequently
the premiums paid vary greatly by province. Funding comes in part from the required
local government subsidies of 30 CNY per person per year for the first 100 CNY of
premiums contributed to the individual account; there is a lower than proportional
subsidy for additional premiums contributed. In addition, to compensate for the lower
fiscal capacity of local governments in central and western China, the national
government finances all basic pension benefits in these regions, compared with only 50
percent of the basic pension benefits in eastern China.
Upon reaching age 60, eligible individuals can receive payments from their
government provided account. This basic pension benefit ranges from 55 to 380 CNY
per month per person in 2012 (Cai et al. 2012; Cheng et al. 2017); the variation is due
to adjustments for the cost of living at the province level (Chen, Eggleston, Sun 2016).
They can also receive payments from their private account if they established one.
Benefits are paid regardless of working status. Because pension benefits are distributed
directly to an individual’s bank accounts without a need to claim benefits in person,
migration may not discourage enrollment. In rural China, almost all older persons have
at least one bank account.
3 Conceptual Framework and Empirical Approach
3.1 Conceptual Framework
NRPS enrollment decisions depend on the expected benefits and costs of the
NRPS, which in turn depend on a variety of factors. A key aspect is how generations
within each family are linked in enrollment decisions. The generations are naturally
linked since in Chinese culture, intergenerational ties are strong, ranging from
cohabitation, to older parents providing childcare to their grandchildren, to the role of
sons in taking responsibility for their elderly parents. In addition, the rules of NRPS, as
discussed above, require that at least one child enrolls to make the older parents eligible
for NRPS, unless the parents are childless. These considerations link the enrollment
decisions of both generations not only to their own characteristics but also to those of
the other generation. Given the out-migration of children, village characteristics may
also affect the decisions of the older parents left behind, because their children are no
longer around to give help.
Below we discuss these and other factors and their potential impact on enrollment
decisions. Because both the set of factors relevant to the decisions and their
hypothesized impacts will differ somewhat across the two generations, we discuss them
separately below but also focus on the commonalities and particularly on the
intergenerational linkages.
Individuals over age 60 are the most likely to enroll in NRPS as the program is
designed to benefit them. Their benefits to enrollment are greater if they are younger
(but at least 60 years old) or if their spouses are also eligible. A pension-eligible spouse
5

may promote enrollment via mutual assistance and income and information sharing
between the couple. There may also be gender differences that need to be determined
empirically. The childless over the age of 60 at the time of roll-out have the most clearcut incentive to enroll: they are immediately eligible for pension payouts but are not
required to contribute and are not subject to the Family Binding Policy.
For those with children, at least one child must enroll and contribute financially to
NRPS. When altruism alone is not enough to encourage enrollment by the adult
children, then intra-family or intergenerational agreements might facilitate enrollment.
Such agreements could be implicit or explicit, and payments might be non-financial
(older parents providing childcare or housing) or financial (giving money to pay for the
child’s NRPS contribution). The costs and benefits of these arrangements for both
generations would depend on the ages, number, and gender of both the older parents
and their children.
Adult children can play a central, but mixed, role in parents’ enrollment decisions
for multiple reasons. First, the greater the number of children, the greater the likelihood
of at least one child enrolling or more children collectively paying pension premiums
for their parents’ benefits. However, a larger number of children may also reflect
stronger informal old-age support that may offset motives for pension enrollment
(Packard et al. 2002; Li and Olivera 2005; Auerbach et al. 2007; Ebenstein and Leung
2010). Second, the older the adult children are, the greater the expected, discounted
benefit to them of enrolling, and again, the more willing they might be to enroll7. Third,
children’s out-migration likely weakens emotional and geographical ties to their parents
and the ability to make intra-family commitments to enroll parents with the Family
Binding Policy. Fourth, the better the decision-making abilities of elders and their
children (e.g. higher educational attainment), the greater the probability of a parent
understanding the benefits of enrolling. Children may play a large role, as their
education is on average higher than that of their parents.
Financial protection available to older parents could have offsetting impacts on
enrollment decisions. Stronger financial protection, such as from their children, spouses,
other pension and non-pension income, and health insurance coverage, 8 may
financially enable older persons to enroll, and enroll more rapidly. However, such
protection may also reduce the need to enroll. Clearly, poor health could increase the
demand for both pension income and personal care services, but poor health might also
reduce the number of years over which to expect to reap the returns from NPRS. These
are potentially offsetting impacts that must be determined empirically.
For the elderly, there is only the potential for financial gain, and no risk of losing
money, so trust in government should play little role in enrollment decisions; although
7 Yet adult children might resist contributing due to: distrust of the government continuing the
program, and of payout levels; skepticism that the parent would redistribute the payouts; lack of
financial resources; lack of altruism; and other factors.
8
Health insurance coverage could serve either as a substitute for or complement to NRPS. It would be
a substitute as it could help with both the financial risk and provision of care. It would be a
complement for at least three reasons: 1) both serve as a risk reduction approach; 2) health insurance
coverage may raise one’s life expectancy and expectancy of accruing greater pension benefits (Lei and
Lin 2009; Wagstaff et al. 2009; Kimberly et al. 2010; Hu et al. 2012); and 3) both may be due to greater
trust in government (Li and Olivera 2005).

6

there might be some residual impact. For example, parents might altruistically be
concerned about the long-term viability of a system that might put their children’s funds
at risk (Crabbe 2005; Lei et al. 2013), and thus low trust might reduce the enrollment
rate. The net effect is likely to be a small and/or insignificant impact on enrollment
decisions.
Village characteristics may influence individuals’ pension enrollment decisions,
for example, through peer learning and sharing of a village infrastructure to aid the
enrollment process. The village may be particularly influential towards childless elders,
those whose children have migrated, or who do not have close relations with their
children.
Individuals aged 45–59 have incentives to enroll in NRPS, both for their own
direct benefit and to help their older parents. While their own incentives are largely
similar to the older cohort and interact with the enrollment decisions of their parents,
there are additional considerations. Below we consider pension decisions from the
perspective of the younger generation. We do not repeat the discussion about
intergenerational links in the enrollment decision.
Just like the older generation, the younger generation should be more likely to
enroll, the more years they can reap pension benefits relative to the number of years in
which they will have to make payments. Thus, it is the individuals who are older but
still under 60 who are more likely to enroll. They will have to contribute for fewer years
before receiving benefits. They also bear a lower risk of losing benefits if the pension
system falters. As explained before, having a pension-eligible spouse, having stronger
trust in government or better decision-making abilities are all expected to promote
pension enrollment, but financial protection may play a mixed role. A higher number
of senior parents still alive, or not all children migrating out, are likely associated with
greater enrollment. To the extent that the younger generation, especially migrants, has
relatively weak ties to their home communities, the characteristics of the village might
not significantly affect their enrollment decisions. Unlike the older parents who are
required to have at least one child enroll in order to be eligible to enroll, the Family
Binding Policy does not apply to the younger parents and their children. Therefore, the
number of children in one’s family only indicates the extent of informal old-age support
that the younger parents receive; thus, more children in the family may dampen pension
enrollment.
3.2 Empirical Approach
In our empirical analysis, we determine if the factors discussed above explain
enrollment decisions as predicted from the above section. We analyze three enrollment
outcomes, including the extensive margin (i.e. the decision to enroll) as well as
intensive margins (i.e. the time to enrollment and premium paid). Specifically, we
estimate the following:
Pensionifv   +X i +X f  +X v  c   ifv
(1)
where Pensionijv is separately each one of the three outcome variables, and Xs are a
7

rich set of covariates at the individual level ( X i ; i for individual), the family level ( X f ;
f for family), and the village level ( X v ; v for village). Information at all three levels is
key to understanding enrollment decisions. The list of X variables is summarized in
section 4.2 and in Table 1. Also, because the NRPS was rolled out at the county level,
all regressions account for county-specific heterogeneities by controlling for county
fixed effects ( c ). Standard errors are clustered at the county level. All estimations are
weighted to obtain nationally representative results. We present empirical findings
separately for the older and younger cohorts, as explained above. In our sensitivity
analysis, we test our results across three specifications. Then, using what we determine
to be our preferred specification, we separately estimate female and male subsamples
to capture gender differences.
4. Data, Analytic Sample, and Variables
4.1 Data and Analytical Sample
We use the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) 2012 national sample to study
determinants of the decision to enroll in NRPS, time to enrollment, and for individuals
below age 60, premiums paid. The survey covers 44,693 individuals from 13,459
households across 25 provinces of China 9 , geographically representing 95% of the
Chinese population (Xie and Lu 2015). Because the survey was fielded about two years
after the rollout of NRPS, we can observe if, when, and to what extent an individual
enrolled in NPRS10. The two-year gap allows substantial time for individuals to respond
to the program.
Characteristics at the individual, family, and village levels hypothesized to affect
enrollment decisions are available in the data set. For individuals, standard socioeconomic and demographic characteristics were collected, including education, family
structure, age, income and wealth. Data were also obtained on health status, migration,
county of residence, and a number of relatively rare variables pertinent to our study.
The latter include the individual’s trust in government and the functioning of the social
security system. In addition, there is information on whether the individual is enrolled
in any other public programs. The family level data have rich information on family
composition, including adult children living away from home. For the older cohort, we
match parents to their children even if they were not co-residing. For the younger cohort,
we include both those with and without living parents. Phone surveys were used to
contact migrant children. Such data are critical to our analysis of the intergenerational
dynamics of pension enrollment. Data characterizing villages were also collected as
part of the survey. Home villages can be important for enrollment decisions among the
rural elderly.
Our analytical sample is restricted to individuals who are over age 45 and eligible
for NRPS enrollment (i.e. holding rural registration). We analyze the sample by two age
categories, i.e., individuals over age 60 who have children (4,635 observations) and
Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, and Hainan are excluded.
Because the NRPS rolled-out in most counties between 2010 and 2012, very few counties had initiated
the program when the CFPS 2010 baseline sample was collected. Therefore, this current study uses only
the CFPS 2012 sample.

9

8

those aged 45–60 (6,811 observations, of whom 38.5 percent have no senior parents
alive), to capture differing incentives to enroll and to contribute to the system. Except
reporting the percentage that enrolls, we do not analyze the 142 childless older persons
in our sample as the size is too small. We also ignore those under 45 as they have little
incentive to enroll until later in life. Table 1 reports summary statistics for the two age
cohorts.
4.2 Variables
Outcome measures. As indicated above, we examine three decisions related to
enrollment in the NRPS: the decision to enroll, an individual’s premium paid, and the
decision time to enrollment. See Table 1 for summary statistics and Figure 1 for
distributions by age. The decision to enroll is a binary variable, equal to 1 if an
individual has enrolled and zero otherwise. The NRPS enrollment rate is, on average,
54.2 percent among the younger cohort and 59.5 percent among the older cohort. An
individual’s premium paid represents the level of individual contribution, ranging from
zero to 7,200 CNY per year per person. The average pension premium, including those
who do not enroll, is 89 CNY per year per person among all people age 45–60, whether
or not enrolled in the NRPS. The average pension premium among enrollees is 162
CNY per year per person. Decision time measures the years taken for an individual to
enroll after the program became available at the county level.11 We calculated this from
the date on which the program was initiated in their county until the date of their
enrollment. We use the rollout dates for all counties listed in county-level official
documents provided by China’s Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security
(Appendix Figure 3). Table 1 suggests that the younger cohort (aged 45–60) wait only
slightly longer to make pension enrollment decisions compared to their older
counterparts, which is consistent with the Family Binding Policy that requires older
parents and their eligible children to enroll at the same time.
Control variables. Factors at the individual, family, and village level that may
influence pension enrollment decisions are included in regressions. See Tables 2A and
2B for the list of covariates for the older cohort and Tables 3A–3C for that of the
younger cohort. We control for somewhat different sets of variables due to the design
of NRPS as discussed above.
Individual level variables. In both groups, we control for: age, gender, whether the
individual is a household head, marital status, own and children’s years of education,
party membership, presence of chronic disease and impairment in activities of daily
living (ADL), migration status (if outside the local county in the past year), enrollment
in the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS)12, and enrollment in ORPS. For both
groups, trust in government and concern over poor functioning of the social security
system are respectively measured by three binary indicators, from low (responses of 0–
3), medium (4–6), to strong (7–10). The lowest category of each of these subjective
For those who did not enroll, their decision time is defined as the difference between the county
level rollout date and the date of the interview. The results for premium paid and decision timing are
not sensitive to exclusion of those who did not enroll by the survey date.
12
Since its rollout in 2003, NCMS has rapidly expanded its coverage, service use, cost control and
quality. NCMS is now a cornerstone of China’s rural health system (Meng and Xu 2014).

assessments is omitted as the comparison group. For those aged 45–60, we also control
for age groups 45–50 (omitted comparison group), 50–55 and 55–60 using binary
indicators.
Family characteristics. For the older cohort, we control for household size,
whether their spouses are age-eligible for pension benefits (no spouse as the comparison
group), years of schooling of their most educated child, and the relationship with their
children. For the younger cohort, we control for the existence of elderly parents, and
then for those with at least one living elderly parent, parents’ characteristics (e.g. age
categories interacted with gender). We do not control for their relationship with parents
as 38.5 percent of them have no parents alive. For both groups, we also control for:
house value, land size, number of sons and daughters, whether all the children are outmigrants or not, and family income (excluding pension) in quintiles. See Appendix
Table 1 for information on income quintiles; note that the bottom three quintiles were
below the international poverty line at the time of the survey.13
Village characteristics. We also control for village factors, including income per
capita, proportion of villagers enrolled, number of enrollees above the age of 60 who
fail to claim benefits, and the elapsed time since the first villager received a pension
payment. We also control for geographic access to health care and population size at
the village level.
5. Empirical Results
In the regression tables for the older individuals, we examine their decision to
enroll (Table 2A) and time to enrollment (Table 2B) in NRPS. However, because those
over 60 are not required to contribute pension premiums, we cannot examine premiums
paid. The full sample results across three specifications are displayed in columns (1) to
(3). Specifically, we present column (1) with no measure of the relationship between
parents and children, column (2) with such measures, and column (3) with an additional
mechanistic factor – if any eligible child enrolls in the NRPS – as stipulated in the
Family Binding Policy. Following our main specification in column (2), columns (4)
and (5) separately estimate female and male subsamples because children’s willingness
to contribute financially and through in-person care might differ by gender of the parent.
In the regression tables for the younger individuals, we display the results for
decision to enroll (Tables 3A), time to enrollment (Table 3B), and premiums paid (Table
3C). We present column (1) with number of living parents and their age profiles, column
(2) adds if all children have migrated away from their parents, column (3) adds gender
composition of living parents, and columns (4) and (5) separately estimating female
and male subsamples using the same set of variables as column (2) for the full sample.
We examine gender differences, as culturally sons play a larger role in ensuring the
well-being of elders.
Individuals 60 and above
Note also that pension benefits are not counted as income when assessing eligibility for social welfare
programs, which rules out the potential concern that people in the lowest income quintile fail to enroll as
they may become ineligible for other benefits due to their pension benefits.

Our primary focus is on older persons who have children. However, as noted above,
there are too few childless elders over 60 to analyze them, they are eliminated from our
sample. We analyze only those with children. In general, relatively few personal
characteristics affect both outcomes across the samples and specifications. Those who
are younger among this set of those over 60 years old likely reap greater benefits to
enrolling but are no more likely to enroll. Rather surprisingly, neither own education
nor that of one’s own children significantly promotes either enrollment decision among
older persons. This lack of significance may occur as both the parents and children have
very low levels of education; 2.17 and 4.92 respectively for the older and young cohort.
Gender is never significant, but when estimates are conducted separately by gender
there are a few differences in coefficients, particularly in time to enrollment.
Specifically, coefficients on number of children in different age categories and the
number of sons are significant for males but not for females in the time to enrollment.
Contrary to expectations, the set of variables indicating the age categories of one’s
children are insignificant in both decisions. For example, elderly parents with children
in their fifties are no more likely to enroll than others.
However, prior enrollment in other programs, i.e. health insurance (NCMS) and
pension program (ORPS), are all significant. The results show that ORPS is a substitute
(negative coefficients) for NRPS both in terms of enrollment and time to enrollment
(positive coefficients). NCMS is a complement to NRPS in both decisions. These
findings are consistent with the function of each of the programs. Compared to low
trust, stronger trust in government increases enrollment and reduces time to enrollment.
Having migrated out also significantly increases enrollment, but does not reduce time
to enrollment. Note that only 1.1 percent of this older group have migrated.
We find scant evidence of within-couple coordination to maximize the gains for
the family (only one time is one of the variables significant). For example, other things
being equal, and compared to unmarried elderly persons, having a spouse above age 60
is not associated with a higher pension enrollment rate, as would be expected.
Out-migration of all children from the home county significantly reduces parental
enrollment but only when controlling for if an eligible child has enrolled in the NRPS
(column (3), Table 2A) and in the separate estimates for males (column (5) Table 2A).
However, out-migration of all children is insignificant in all estimates of the time to
enrollment. Parents who help their children to manage financial assets tend to enroll
sooner in some specifications (column 2 Table 2A) and for women when estimated
separately (column 4 Table 2A). This evidence weakly suggests that reduced
intergenerational connectedness may discourage enrollment for some.
However, having a child enroll in NRPS is positively and significantly associated
both with NRPS enrollment (column (3), Table 2A) and with a shorter time to
enrollment (column 3, Table 2B). This is an expected mechanistic relationship, given
the requirement for older persons to have at least one eligible child enrolled in the
program if they are to receive benefits.
Only those in the lowest quintile of income are more likely to enroll and enroll
more rapidly, while there are no significant impacts for the second and third quintiles
of income. This means that a majority of poor older individuals are no more likely to
11

take advantage of NRPS than their richer counterparts.
Village characteristics strongly influence individual pension enrollment decisions
in ways that are consistent with the predicted signs. Specifically, individuals’
enrollment rates are higher and enrollment is quicker if there are: 1) a larger share of
villagers who enrolled in the NRPS; 2) a smaller number of enrollees above 60 in the
village who failed to claim pension benefits; and 3) a villager who started to receive
pension benefits at an earlier date. These village level findings are all consistent with
peer learning, and perhaps with other factors, such as a strong village leader.
Individuals aged 45-60
Perhaps a more interesting and more complicated decision is that of children of
elderly parents. Consistent with expectations, individuals are more likely to enroll when
they are closer to the pension eligibility cut-off age. Specifically, age groups 50–55 and
55–60 are more likely to enroll, enroll with less delay, and pay higher premiums
compared to the younger age group 45–50.
In this age group as compared to the older group, own education and that of the
most educated child play a role in decisions. Specifically, own education increases
premiums paid in all specifications but not for females. Children’s education increases
enrollment in all specifications but not for males, while children’s education weakly
promotes contributions to premiums in all specifications but not for females. There are
other differences across the estimates by gender as well. For example, being a
household head increases enrollment only in separate estimates for males.
Other individual level variables that are significantly and positively associated
with at least one outcome measure are: male, years of schooling, household head,
chronic diseases, ADL, and strong concern over the social security system. However,
these are not consistently significant across the outcomes and specifications.
As we observe for the older cohort, enrolling in NCMS increases pension
enrollment rates and reduces the time taken to enroll; however, it is insignificant in
premiums paid. In addition, enrolling in ORPS reduces enrollment and premium
contribution, and increases decision time. These results suggest that for this age group,
ORPS is a substitute for NRPS and health insurance is a complement as is true for the
older cohort. Strong trust in government has a similar, positive impact for this age group
on enrollment and premiums paid and a negative impact on time to enrollment as
similar to what was observed with the older cohort.14
As was found in the older cohort, there is little evidence of within-couple
arrangements for the three NRPS enrollment outcomes. Only for the premium decision
and only for when regressions are estimated separately by gender are any of the spouse
variables significant. For women, having a spouse over age 60 has a negative impact
on the premium, but for men having a spouse of any age increases premium
contributions. In other words, wives promote husbands’ enrollment, but not vice versa.
There is mixed evidence on the impact of intergenerational arrangements on
Our placebo tests replace trust in government by trust in parents, Americans, strangers or neighbors;
but none of these is associated with pension enrollment decisions, suggesting that unobserved factors
might not drive both trust and individual enrollment decisions. These results are available upon request.

enrollment decisions among children aged 45–59 with parents age-eligible for NRPS.
Some of the age categories measuring having two parents over age 60 are significant in
the expected directions for the three enrollment decisions; with the omitted reference
group of no senior parent. Specifically, having older parents (e.g. two parents 60–65
years old) increases both enrollment and premiums and reduces the time to enrollment.
This is consistent with the idea that an increase in the number of eligible parents
heightens the potential gains of NRPS participation for adult children. Having two
parents over the age of 70 also increases enrollment and reduces time to enroll, but does
not affect premiums. However, there is little such evidence when comparing only one
parent over age 60. Further, parents with more sons significantly reduce pension
premiums, but not in separate estimates for males.
The only significant impacts of income are for females in the second and the third
lowest quintiles, indicating that females in two out of three low income groups are more
likely to enroll. All of the other income variables have insignificant coefficients in the
decision to enroll, the time to enrollment, and premiums paid.
It is interesting to note that village effects for this younger cohort are weaker than
those for the older cohort. One plausible explanation is that peers may exert stronger
influence on older persons compared to the younger generation, who are more educated
and are more likely to migrate out; they may adjust their reference groups to those more
relevant to their lives.
6. Conclusions and Discussion
We find evidence of low and suboptimal pension enrollment in NRPS by eligible
individuals and their families. For the older cohort, few individual and family
characteristics are significant in enrollment decisions, but village characteristics play
an important role. For the younger cohort, we find that more individual-level
characteristics are significant, including own and children’s education. Village
characteristics are important but not as much as for the older cohort. For both cohorts,
we find little evidence that families make simple and mutually beneficial intra-family
enrollment decisions. Our finding of suboptimal enrollment highlights the need for
research to determine how best to improve enrollment.
The suboptimal enrollment takes several forms across different populations.
Specifically, individuals enrolled in the unsubsidized ORPS could benefit by simply
switching to the highly subsidized NRPS program, yet not all do. All childless elderly
could enroll in NRPS without any financial risk, yet not all do. There are also benefits
to be shared across generations through intra-family transfers, yet these financial gains
for the elderly have also been left untapped. Relatively younger senior parents or senior
parents with children approaching pension-eligible age have more to gain than others,
but such benefits are not often realized.
Thus, many of China’s rural elderly lack the financial support they need in old age
and this problem is likely to remain incompletely addressed due to suboptimal
enrollment. The problems may worsen as factors driving financial insecurity likely
exacerbate the problem over time. The number of adult children migrating to cities is
increasing as is the life expectancy, leaving older parents without in-person support
13

possibly for many years. To address these challenges, China implemented NRPS in
every county in the country. Despite the broad eligibility of the program and the
financial gains possible, we find evidence of low and suboptimal participation. And
thus, the full gains will not accrue due to the low take-up rates. Many of those who
could most benefit from NRPS do not enroll.
Why do people leave money on the table? Low monetary returns to pension
enrollment is unlikely to be a viable explanation. This would be particularly unlikely
for those without children, for whom it would be costless to receive benefits. It is also
unlikely among people who are over 60 years old, because their pension payments
would be several times higher than the premiums that would have to be paid by their
children. The family unit would be better off with enrollment, and side payments could
be redistributed. Also, the operational cost of claiming pension benefits is low in China
due to the direct transfers of pension payments to individuals’ banking accounts. This
might help to explain why we find that migrants do not enroll at a lower rate.
Enrollment could remain low due to a lack of understanding about the program
and inability to understand the potential gains to intra-family enrollment decisions and
redistribution in reaction to the Family Binding Policy and then to respond. Both may
occur due to low education or low financial literacy. Distrust in government could also
discourage pension enrollment, and our evidence supports this to some extent. However,
as discussed, older cohorts are guaranteed a financial gain, or at least no downside
financial risk, so this should mitigate their concern about trust. Our evidence suggests
aspects of the village may promote optimal decisions, at least for the older cohort. One
could postulate that, gains in education might mitigate this problem, but only for the
children of the younger cohort, did we find a significant, beneficial effect of education
on enrollment decisions.
This study has notable strengths including being the first analysis to examine
suboptimal pension enrollment in NRPS; and also, to explore plausible explanations
including intra-family and intergenerational arrangements. Our ability to link data on
the generations enables us to observe these family dynamics. Also by collecting and
matching county administrative data on pension roll-out with individual’s pension
choices, we can measure the actual to the optimal pension enrollment decisions.
Despite the strengths, this study has some limitations as well. One limitation is that
this is largely a descriptive study. Another limitation is that despite the richness of these
data there are some unmeasured factors such as a direct measure of financial literacy.
Also, although we have education of the children for both generations, we do not have
information on education and some other personal characteristics for the parents of the
children age 45-59. This is due to the fact that 38 percent of them do not have a living
parent (See Table 1).
The insights from this paper may be applied to other developing countries. As in
China, the percentage of the elderly population in many other developing countries is
growing more rapidly than younger cohorts, many of the elderly are poor and
undereducated, and children are migrating to cities. Family ties are often strong, but
social protection systems are weak. Emerging evidence demonstrates the benefits of
enrolling in social pension programs in developing countries, but enrollment rates are
14

low (Pension Watch 2017). The low enrollment can limit the economic, health and
social benefits of such social pension programs.

Notes: The NRPS initiated at the end of 2009. The non-zero figures before 2009 represent the unsubsidized ORPS that covered a tiny proportion of rural residents, mainly in
developed regions in China.

Age
Notes: Proportion of 80+ age cohort is 1.2%. So they are dropped in the figure.

Notes: Only 1.2 percent of respondents are above age 80, and they are excluded from this figure. Other
pensions mainly include commercial pension and pension subsidy to the oldest of old, and a tiny
proportion of enterprise employee pension or government and public institution employee pension.
Having commercial pensions or pension subsidy to the oldest of old does not preclude people from
enrolling in NRPS. Note that there is no policy regarding potential reduced benefits if one enrolled in
more than one of these programs. While the unsubsidized ORPS is still in operation (but not accepting
new enrollment) and people are not allowed to enroll in NRPS and ORPS at the same time, rational
agents should simply switch from this program to the highly subsidized NRPS with higher return and
lower risk.

Data: CFPS (2012)
Notes: The 1.90 USD international poverty line corresponds to 4,577 CNY per person per year (1 USD
= 6.60 CNY).
Therefore, all individuals in the lowest three income quintiles were below the international poverty line
at the time of survey.
