The Equilibrium and Optimal Timing of Price Changes

ABSTRACT

This paper studies the welfare properties of the equilibrium timing of

price changes. Staggered price-setting has the advantage that it permits
rapid adjustment to firm-specific shocks but the disadvantage that it causes

price level inertia and therefore increases aggregate fluctuations. Because
each firm ignores its contribution to inertia, staggering can be a stable

equilibrium even if it is highly inefficient. In addition, there can be
multiple equilibria in the timing of price changes; indeed, whenever there is
an inefficient staggered equilibrium, there is also an efficient equilibrium
with synchronized price-setting.

INTRODUCTION

The timing of wage and price changes is crucial to the real effects of
nominal disturbances in an important set of recent Keynesian theories.
Taylor (1979, 1980) and Blanchard (1983, 1986) show that if firms change their

prices and wages often but different firms adjust at different times, the
aggregate price level responds slowly to nominal shocks: staggered
price—setting causes price level inertia. As a result, economic fluctuations
may be much larger, and welfare much lower, when price changes are

staggered rather than synchronized.

These results raise a puzzle: why do firms choose to change prices at
different times if they would be better off under synchronization? One

possible answer is that firms' decisions to stagger are evidence that

staggering is in fact desirable. This paper investigates the alternative
possibility that synchronization is socially optimal but that some market

failure leads to staggering in a decentralized economy. This issue cannot be
addressed in the Taylor and l3lanchard models, because these authors treat

the timing of price changes as exogenous. The purpose of this paper is thus
to make the timing endogenous and then study the welfare properties of the
equilibrium timing.
1

In the Taylor and Blanchard models, firms are identical and all shocks

are aggregate, and so firms have no desire to change prices at different
times. As a result, if timing is made endogenous, the outcome is
synchronization-—the Taylor and Blanchard models cannot explain staggering.1

Therefore, in addition to making the timing of price changes endogenous, we

introduce an incentive for staggering. Specifically, we add to the Blanchard
model the most obvious reason that firms in actual economies do not change
prices simultaneously: shocks that alter profit—maximizing prices occur at

different times for different firms. For example, the gas station on the
corner changes prices at different times from the grocery store next door
because OPEC meetings occur at different times from weather changes in farm
areas. Using a model with both firm—specific and aggregate shocks, we

derive the condition that determines which of synchronization and staggering
is optimal and the conditions for each to be an equilibrium.
Comparison of the equilibrium and optimal timing leads to two major

conclusions. First, inefficient staggering is indeed possible. If there are
firm-specific shocks of any size, then staggered price—setting, with each firm

changing its price when it receives shocks, is a stable equilibrium. But if
the variance of nominal shocks is large relative to the variance of
idiosyncratic shocks, synchronization is preferable to staggering——it limits

firms' ability to adjust to idiosyncratic shocks but, by eliminating price level

inertia, it reduces the size of aggregate fluctuations. Moreover, if the
variance of aggregate shocks is large, the increase in fluctuations and the

reduction in welfare caused by staggering can be large. The reason that
staggering can be an equilibrium despite being highly inefficient is that

demonstrated formally for the Blanchard model in this paper and in Ball and
Cecchetti (1987).

firms' choices of the timing of their price changes have externalities. By

contributing to inertia, a firm's decision to adjust at different times than
others hurts all firms. In a large economy, each price—setter ignores this

effect, since it takes the behavior of the price level as given.2
Our second principal conclusion is that there can be multiple equilibria
in the timing of price changes——synchronization can remain an equilibrium

even when firm-specific shocks make staggering an equilibrium. Intuitively,

adjusting its price at the same times as others allows a firm to reduce

fluctuations in its relative price. If price changes are bunched, this is a
strong force causing them to remain bunched. But if price changes are
staggered, there is no force to bring them together, and so they remain
staggered. The incentive to remain bunched is so strong that the condition
for synchronization to be an equilibrium is weaker than the condition for it

to be optimal. Thus, if staggering is an inefficient equilibrium, there must
be a superior synchronized equilibrium as well. In addition, inefficient
synchronization is possible.

We demonstrate these results in Blanchard's model modified in the

simplest ways that allow us to address the subject of the paper.
Specifically, we follow Blanchard in assuming that prices are fixed for two

periods; thus a firm's only choice about timing is whether to change its price
every even period or every odd period. Similarly, we introduce idiosyncratic

shocks in the simplest way that gives firms incentives to change prices at

2. Just as we show that choices of the timing of price changes have
externalities, recent analyses of "small menu cost" models (Mankiw, 1985,
Akerlof and Yellen, 1985, and Ball and Romer, 1987) and of long-term
contract models (Ball, 1986a, 1986b) show that choices of the frequency
of price changes have externalities: less frequent price changes increase
the variance of real aggregate demand, which harms all firms,

different times: we assume that half of the firms in the economy receive

idiosyncratic shocks every even period and half every odd period. In the
conclusion, we discuss generalizations such as stochastic arrival of
firm—specific shocks and more complicated rules for when to change prices.

We argue that our results about the possibility of inefficient staggering and
the existence of multiple equilibria are likely to be robust.3

The remainder of the paper consists of five sections. Section II
presents our model. In Section III, we solve for the behavior of the
aggregate price level under synchronization and under staggering. This
leads, in Section IV, to the condition that determines which regime is
optimal. Section V derives the conditions under which synchronization and
3. Several previous authors present models of endogenous staggering.
The models closest to ours are those of Fethke and Policano (1984, 1986a),
who study the timing of wage negotiations, and Parkin (1986). (See also
Fethke and Policano [1986b, 19871 and Matsukawa [1986]. Maskin and Tirole
[1985] and Gertner [19851 study staggering that results from strategic
behavior within an oligopolistic industry.) Our analysis differs from this

previous work in three major respects. First, we address a different
question: while previous papers focus on the conditions under which
staggering and synchronization are equilibria, we focus on the welfare
properties of equilibria. (An exception in previous work is Fethke and

Policano [1986a], who compare equilibrium and optimal timing in their model.)
Second, the source of staggering in our model-—heterogeneous times of
firm—specific shocks——is clearly an important reason that firms in actual

economies change prices at different times. In previous models, by contrast,
staggering occurs only under unrealistic conditions. Fethke and Policano
(1986a) show that staggering arises in their models only if the economy
consists of a few large sectors containing firms that receive identical
shocks. In Parkin's model, staggering arises only under unusual assumptions
about monetary policy: an increase in the price level must lead to a
decrease in the money supply. Third, in previous models of endogenous
timing, staggering does not lead to price level inertia. In Fethke and
Policano, the reason is that wages, while "predetermined," are not "fixed":
firms set wages for several periods at once, but they can choose different
wages for different periods. In Parkin, the reason is simply that the model
contains no aggregate shocks. Without price level inertia, staggering does
not lead to large output fluctuations; thus previous models ignore what we
consider the key macroeconomic effect of staggering.

robustness and offer conclusions.
II. THE MODEL

Our model is a simple extension of Blanchard's (see the version in
Blanchard and Fischer, 1985, ch. 9). The economy contains a large number of

price—setters who adjust their prices every two periods. Blanchard studies
the behavior of the economy under two regimes: synchronization, in which

by assumption all firms change prices in even periods, and staggering, in

which half change in even periods and half in odd periods. As described
above, we depart from Blanchard's work by allowing firms to choose whether

to change prices in even or odd periods and by introducing idiosyncratic
productivity shocks.

The specifics of the model are as follows. The economy consists of N

farmers, where N is a large number. Each farmer uses his own labor to
produce a differentiated product, then sells the product and purchases the

products of all other farmers.4 Farmers take each others' prices as given.

when each is optimal and when each is an equilibrium. Because the idiosyncratic shocks that distinguish our model from Blanchard's average to

Equations (14) - (15) show that, under synchronization, the price level
adjusts fully to monetary shocks every two periods. Equation (20) shows that
staggering leads to price level inertia--the price level adjusts slowly to

shocks. The degree of inertia is greatest ( X is largest) when V is small.
v is small when E is large (firms face highly elastic product demand)
and when y is small (the marginal disutility of labor increases slowly).

also has a benefit: it allows odd as well as even firms to adjust fully
to idiosyncratic shocks. If these shocks are large, the benefit outweighs
the costs, and staggering is superior to synchronization.

V. THE EQUILIBRIUM TIMING OF PRICE CHANGES

This section

derives the conditions under which synchronization arid

staggering are stable equilibria. Part A shows that synchronization is an
equilibrium if the variance of the idiosyncratic shocks is sufficiently
small compared to the variance of monetary shocks, and that this condition

is weaker than the condition for synchronization to be optimal. Part B

considers staggering. We first show that if

= 0

(Blanchard' s model),

then staggering is an equilibrium, but an unstable one. We then show that if
> 0 (that is, if idiosyncratic shocks of any size exist), staggering

is a stable equilibrium. These results, along with those of the previous
section, imply that staggering can be a stable equilibrium even if it is
inefficient, but that synchronization is also an equilibrium in this

case. In addition, synchronization can be an inefficient equilibrium.

13

A. Is Synchronization an Equilibrium?
Suppose that all firms change prices in even periods. Synchronization
is a Nash equilibrium if no firm, taking the behavior of others as given,
can

gain by

switching to odd periods. The incentive for switching is

greatest for odd firms, since switching would allow them to adjust fully

to idiosyncratic shocks. Thus, to see when synchronization is an equilibrium,
we compare the loss of an odd firm in the synchronized regime to its loss if
it switches.

The loss of an odd firm in the synchronized regime is

SYNC

(equation

(23)). To compute the firm's loss if it switches to odd periods, we first

derive its price—setting rule for this situation. Since the firm is small
relative to the economy, the behavior of the aggregate price level is the

same as in the synchronized regime. If t is an odd period, then Pt
and

mt+i (equations (14)—(15)).

Substituting these formulas into the

price-setting rule, (11), shows that the switcher, firm i ,

to the variance of money, which determines the variance of the price level.

Synchronization must be an equilibrium if it is

optimal, and it

may

an equilibrium even if staggering is optimal.

This result is surprising. Staggering leads to price level inertia, and
hence to large fluctuations in real aggregate demand, but each firm ignores
this negative macroeconomic effect in deciding when to change its price.
Intuitively,

this

suggests that synchronization is more likely to be socially
15

optimal than to be a decentralized equilibrium.

To understand why we find the opposite, recall that synchronization is
optimal if firms' losses are smaller under synchronization than under
staggering, while synchronization is an equilibrium if each firm's loss is

smaller under synchronization than it is if the firm switches out of
synchronization.8 Thus our result that synchronization is more likely to be
an equilibrium than to be optimal means that a firm that switches from

synchronization is worse off than a firm in the staggered regime.

Equivalently, a switcher gains if half of the rest of the firms switch with
him. We now explain why this is so.

If half the firms join the switcher, then price—setting is staggered and

the switcher is hurt by the resulting increase in aggregate demand

fluctuations. This is outweighed, however, by a gain to the switcher: his

relative price fluctuates less than it does if he switches alone. There are
two reasons. First, the switcher changes his price at the same times as half

the rest of the firms rather than by himself. Second, because of the price
level inertia, even the firms that change prices at different times from the

switcher do not deviate greatly from the prices set by the switcher's cohort;
in contrast, if all other firms changed prices at different times from the
switcher, they would respond fully to monetary shocks in periods in which

he could not respond. The smaller fluctuations in the switcher's

relative price that result when other finns
deviations

switch

with him lead to smaller

of the switcher's output from his utility-maximizing level.

8. More precisely, optimaflty depends on the average of odd and even
losses in the two regimes, while the losses of odd firms alone
determine whether synchronization is an equilibrium (see equations (28) arid
(32)). This distinction is unimportant for the explanation of our
firms'

results.

16

B. Is Staggering a Stable Equilibrium?
We now ask when staggered price—setting is a stable equilibrium.9 The

algebra required for the answer is complicated. We therefore sketch our
arguments here and present the details in Appendix B.
Consider

first the special case of no idiosyncratic shocks (o = 0).

Staggering is clearly a Nash equilibrium in this case. Since the economy
is

large, each firm takes the proportion of firms in each price—setting cohort

as fixed at a half. When there are no idiosyncratic shocks, this means that
each firm views the two cohorts as identical. Thus no firm has an incentive
to change its timing.

Staggering is not stable, however. Our definition of stability follows

Blanchard and Fischer (1985, ch. 9): staggering is stable if, given a small

perturbation in the sizes of the cohorts, firms in the larger cohort have an
incentive to switch to the smaller one. To see whether staggering is stable
in the absence of idiosyncratic shocks, we calculate a firm's loss as a

function of the proportion in its cohort. The derivative of this function

evaluated at one half is negative. Thus if the sizes of the cohorts are
perturbed, the firms in the larger group suffer smaller losses than those in
the smaller group; all firms have an incentive to join the larger one.
The intuition for this result is simple. A firm minimizes unintended

fluctuations in its relative price by changing its price along with as many
other finns

as possible. Thus a firm always wants to join the larger cohort.

9. As throughout the paper, we consider only "uniform" staggering, that
is, a regime with half the firms in earth cohort. One can show that no unequal
division of firms between cohorts is ever a stable equilibrium.

17

In the case in which there are idiosyncratic shocks (o > 0)
however, staggering is stable. If each firm
receives real shocks, and
firm

so

half the firms

changes

are

its price when it

in each cohort, then each

strictly prefers to remain in its cohort rather than to switch. The

reason is simply that switching increases the losses from idiosyncratic shocks

while leaving the losses from monetary shocks unchanged. The loss of a firm

in a cohort is a continuous function of the proportion in the cohort. Thus if
a firm strictly prefers a cohort given that it contains half the firms, the firm
continues to strictly prefer the cohort for a small perturbation away from a

half. As a result, each firm will return to the cohort in which it can
respond fully to idiosyncratic shocks after a small perturbation away from
this equilibrium)-0

Thus a small change in the Blanchard model--the addition o a small
idiosyncratic shock——is sufficient to make staggering a stable equilibrium.

Recall that the variance of the real shock must be large for staggering to be

socially

22

optimal. Thus for cT9/o

positive but sufficiently small,

staggering is an inefficient stable equilibrium. Indeed, the welfare losses
from inefficient staggering can be arbitrarily large: staggering is a stable
equilibrium even if

is very large and

very small, which implies

large losses from the price level inertia caused by staggering and only small

offsetting gains from adjustment to real shocks. The source of this market
failure is the negative macroeconomic externality of price level inertia.

10. Note that our definition of stability is local. The condition for
staggering to be globally stable—-that is, for each firm to return to the
cohort in which it can respond fully to real shocks after an arbitrarily
large perturbation——is the same as the condition for synchronization not
to be an equilibrium.

this range, if price-setters are bunched each firm remains with the bunch

staggered,

there is no force to move firms toward synchronization——a bunch

does not attract firms unless it already exists. Thus both synchronization
and staggering can be self—sustaining. Indeed, our earlier result that
synchronization is an equilibrium whenever it is optimal implies that

whenever there is an inefficient staggered equilibrium, there is a superior
synchronized equilibrium as well.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

A. Robustness
Our analysis employs special assumptions about the timing of shocks and

the choices available to firms concerning the timing of price changes: time is
discrete, the timing of firm—specific shocks is deterministic, and firms can

choose only whether to change prices in odd or even periods. In this
section we discuss the effects of relaxing each of these assumptions. Our
main conclusions are robust to relaxation of the assumptions of discrete time

and of deterministic timing of shocks, and we believe that they are robust to
relaxation of our assumption concerning firms' choices. Staggering is an
inefficient equilibrium in a wide class of models because of the negative

externalities from price level inertia. The result that complete

19

synchronization can be a second equilibrium is not robust, but more general
models possess equilibria with !near synchronization"---regular intervals at
which most though not all prices change simultaneously. Multiple equilibria
arise frequently because many models besides our simple one contain forces
keeping synchronized price—setters together but not bringing staggered
price—setters together.

Continuous Time. Consider first the implications of moving our model

from discrete to continuous time. In the spirit of the discrete time
specification, we assume that the money supply follows a Wiener process and

that the idiosyncratic shocks affecting a given firm occur at a fixed
interval——for concreteness, at a fixed time every month. Similarly, we assume

that the time during the month that shocks arrive is distributed uniformly
across firms.

Finally, each firm changes its price at monthly intervals and

can choose only the time during the month that it makes decisions.

Staggered price setting, with each firm changing its price when it
receives real shocks, can be an inefficient equilibrium in this model. As in
the discrete time model, staggering is a stable equilibrium as long as the
variance of idiosyncratic shocks is positive, but staggering is inefficient if
the variance of monetary shocks is sufficiently large relative to the variance
of idiosyncratic shocks.

In contrast to the discrete time results, however, complete
synchronization is never an equilibrium. If, for example, all firms change

prices at noon on the first of each month, firms that receive shocks an
instant after noon on the first can gain by breaking from synchronization.
The cost to these firms of waiting until their shocks occur to change prices
is infinitesimal, because waiting puts them only slightly out of step with
other price setters, but the benefit from waiting——the ability to adjust to real

20

shocks——is not infinitesimal,

While perfect synchronization cannot be an equilibrium, "near

synchronization" can be. If price setters are bunched at noon on the first,
the ones who receive shocks shortly after this time will move, but the bunch

need not unravel entirely. To see this, suppose that firms whose shocks
arrive between noon and 6:00 P.M. on the first leave the bunch. For a firm
whose shock arrives after 6:00, the costs and benefits of leaving are of the

same order: the cost of being out of step with the bunch by a discrete
amount of time is not infinitesimal. As a result, for some parameter values

there is an equilibrium in which most though not all firms are bunched at

noon on the first. Since staggering is a stable equilibrium as long as there
are idiosyncratic shocks, there can be multiple equilibria. Unfortunately, it
is difficult to compare the condition for near synchronization to be an
equilibrium with the condition for near synchronization or complete
synchronization to be optimal.

Stochastic Arrival of Idiosyncratic Shocks. We now alter the continuous
time version of our model by relaxing the assumption that firm—specific

shocks arrive deterministically. Specifically, let the arrival be a Poisson

process that is independent across firms, and let T

denote the mean time

between a firm's shocks. We continue to allow very limited choices for the

timing of price changes: a firm can change its price either at fixed intervals

of length T or whenever it receives an idiosyncratic shock. (Note that in
either case the average frequency of price changes is l/T .) If each firm
changes prices when it receives shocks, then price—setting is staggered,

since an equal proportion of firms receives shocks at every instant.

Synchronization arises if each firm adjusts at a fixed interval.

21

One can show that staggering is an equilibrium if the variance of firm—

shocks.'1 Synchronization is an equilibrium for

intuition about the welfare properties of equilibria carries

Complicated Rules for When to Change Prices. In both our main

model and the generalizations discussed above, firms choose among a few

simple rules for when to change prices. We now speculate about the
implications

of allowing more complicated rules. Specifically,

can both rise and fall, so that price changes are "two—sided"; see

Blanchard and Fischer, ch. 9.) Although it is not possible to solve for the
behavior of this economy, we believe that staggering can be a stable
equilibrium. In the regime that we envision, each firm would follow

something like an Ss rule, and differences in shocks would cause firms to

an equilibrium if the variance of idiosyncratic shocks is positive but very

The reason is that breaking from staggering means changing prices
fixed rather than random intervals, which allows better adjustment to
monetary shocks. This result is an artifact of our assumptions about firms'
choices concerning the timing of price changes. We believe that in more
general models with random arrival of idiosyncratic shocks, such as the
one discussed below, a positive variance for these shocks assures that
staggering is a stable equilibrium.

at

22

reach their Ss bounds at different times. As in our other models, the
staggered regime could be inefficient because firms ignore their contributions

to price level inertia in deciding when to change prices.
Complete synchronization would clearly not be an equilibrium; firms that

received large idiosyncratic shocks at times other than when all prices were
changed would adjust immediately, and firms whose desired adjustments were

small when prices were changed would choose not to pay the cost of

adjustment. But it appears plausible that once again near synchronization
could be an equilibrium: if most prices changed at certain times, each firm

would have a strong incentive to adjust its price at those times, and this
might sustain the equilibrium. As a realistic example of possible near
synchronization, consider labor contracts. It seems plausible to imagine an
equilibrium in which most wages are set simultaneously at three—year

intervals but in which each contract can be reopened at an irregular time if
a firm experiences an unusually large shock.

B. Conclusions
In Keynesian macroeconomic models, staggered price—setting creates

price level inertia, which increases cyclical fluctuations and reduces welfare.

We ask whether firms could choose to change prices at different times even

if staggering makes them worse off. More generally, we ask whether there is
some market failure that causes the equilibrium timing of price changes in a

decentralized economy to be inefficient. To address these issues, we alter
previous models of staggering by making the timing of price changes
endogenous, and by introducing an incentive for staggering: idiosyncratic

shocks that arrive at different times for different firms.
23

We find that staggering is a stable equilibrium as long as there are
firm—specific shocks of any size. Welfare is lower under staggering than

under synchronization if nominal shocks are sufficiently large compared to

the idiosyncratic shocks; if the nominal shocks are very large, welfare is

much lower. Thus staggering can be a stable equilibrium even if it is highly
inefficient.

Synchronization can be an equilibrium even when firm—specific shocks

make staggering an equilibrium. Multiple equilibria are possible because

there is an incentive for synchronized price—setters to remain bunched, but
not for staggered price—setters to move toward synchronization. The

condition for synchronization to be an equilibrium is weaker than the

condition for it to be optimal. Thus if staggering is an inefficient
equilibrium, there is a superior synchronized equilibrium as well.

The possibility of inefficient staggering suggests a role for government
regulation of price—setting. Welfare might be raised, for example, by a

requirement that firms sign labor contracts in the same years. The existence
of multiple equilibria implies that regulation could be temporary:
synchronization, once achieved, would be self—sustaining.

APPENDIX A

Overview. In the text, following Gray (1978), Blanchard (1983, 1986),
Parkin (1986), Ball (1986a), and others, we make two important simplifying

assumptions. First, we assume that the reduction in individual i's

This Appendix relaxes these two assumptions. Our goal is to derive
results about the behavior of the economy and about welfare that are correct
up to second order. Since (10) is a first order approximation to the true
price

index (see equation (3)), we obviously must replace it with a second

order approximation. For more subtle reasons, we must also alter the

objective function and the price-setting rule. Quadratic loss functions like

ours are often defended on the grounds that they are second order
approximations to true objective functions (see, for example, Parkin). But

they do not in fact lead to results that are correct up to second order.
There are two difficulties.

First, an individual's utility depends on more than how successful he is
in keeping his price close to the utility-maximizing level. Combining

25

equations (1) — (7) in the text, we can write individual i's utility as a

function of the real money stock, the ratio of his actual price to his
utility-maximizing price, and his technology shock 8

are as defined in the text. Using _E[(pt_pt)2]

to measure welfare is thus equivalent to taking a second order approximation

of V(s) and then discarding some of the terms. As we show below, the
most important of the neglected terms are the ones involving the mean
and variance of real money; since the behavior of real money is different

under staggering and synchronization, using _E[(pt_p)2] to measure
utility leads to an inaccurate comparison of welfare in the two regimes,
The second difficulty is that

order

assuming that agents maximize second

approximations to their objective functions, even if

right

is used, does not lead to correct second order approximations

to behavior. Instead, the first order condition for maximizing a second order
(i.e., quadratic) approximation to utility leads to a first order (linear)
approximation to agents' true price—setting rule. 'Thus results using the
price—setting rule in the text are accurate only up to first order——they do

not, for example, correctly describe the (second order) effects of changes in
the variances of shocks.

We now redo our analysis in a way that avoids these problems. To
derive correct second order approximations to price—setting rules, we use

second order approximations to exact first order conditions, not first order

26

conditions for maximizing approximations to utility. To derive correct second
order approximations to welfare, we use a second order approximation to
(A—i) with no terms discarded. Finally, as mentioned above, we use a second

order rather than first order approximation to the true log price level.
Otherwise our analysis parallels that in the text. Our approach leads to
specific results, such as the condition that determines the optimal regime,

that differ from the ones in the text. We show, however, that our qualitative
conclusions are unchanged. (The complexity of the analysis that follows
makes clear why we employ the standard simplifying assumptions in the text
despite the problems discussed above——they simplify the presentation
dramatically.)

Second Order Approximations. Because they will be useful at several
points below, we begin by taking second order approximations to the log

price level and to expected utility.

idiosyncratic shocks but stable if idiosyncratic shocks of any size are

present. This requires that we solve for the behavior of the economy when
the proportions of firms setting prices in even and odd periods differ from
one half.

If an even fins switches to odd periods, its loss equals the loss of an
