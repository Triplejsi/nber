ABSTRACT
Michael Grossman’s seminal publication on the demand for health and health production
(Grossman 1972) has spawned a substantial body of research focusing on the production of infant
health. This article provides a systematic review of the published literature to date on infant
health production and how it has evolved over the past 3-4 decades as data have become more
available, computing has improved, and econometric methods have become more sophisticated.
While empirical research in most fields has expanded in corresponding ways, the infant health
production research has become an important part of the broader and inherently multidisciplinary
literature on intergenerational health. The strongest and most robust findings are that policies
matter for infant health, particularly those affecting access to health care, and that prenatal
smoking and other chemical exposures substantially compromise infant health. Promising
directions for future research include elucidating relevant pathways, reconciling the largely
inconsistent estimated effects of nutrition and education, and exploring the roles of preconceptional and lifetime health care, paternal factors, social support, housing, complementarity
and substitutability of inputs, factors that modify effects of inputs, and evolving medical
technologies.

Introduction
Michael Grossman’s seminal publication on the demand for health and health production
(Grossman 1972) has spawned a substantial body of research focusing specifically on the production of
infant health, wherein maternal prenatal inputs affect the health of the next generation at the earliest
stage of the lifecourse. This work was pioneered by Grossman himself, with his first published piece on
the topic in 1981, and has led to a growing body of research across the globe. This increasingly
influential research in health economics has complemented studies of maternal and child health in other
disciplines and instilled methodological rigor into the broader and inherently interdisciplinary literature.
While it is difficult to link any one set of studies to the enactment of specific policy changes, the body of
research focusing on infant health that has been produced directly or indirectly by Michael Grossman
has contributed a rich portfolio of strong scientific evidence that has been available to policymakers,
program administrators, and advocates interested in maternal and child health. This research includes
evidence on direct effects of policy, such as Medicaid expansions, food stamps, the Special
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and cigarette regulations, and
on the effects of factors such as pollution, education, and job loss that can be influenced by policy
levers.
In this article, we describe the infant health production function framework and the various
ways that economic research on infant health production has evolved over the past 3 to 4 decades. Data
have become vastly richer and more available, computing power has improved enormously, and
econometric methods have become more sophisticated. Inputs considered have evolved substantially.
Early studies focused on the role of healthcare inputs, particularly prenatal care (and insurance
expansions that made prenatal care more available) and cigarette smoking. Subsequent studies
investigated the effects of inputs such as education, maternal employment, public programs that
provide income or material assistance, and healthcare technology, and very recent studies broadened
2

the lens to consider the effects of in utero stress stemming from maternal exposure to pollution and
natural disasters while pregnant, based on the fetal origins hypothesis in the medical literature (Barker
1992). Outcomes considered have expanded beyond infant mortality to include measures of
birthweight, gestational age, fetal loss, and infant morbidity.
The objective of this paper is to provide a review of the published literature to date on infant
health production—that by and inspired by Michael Grossman—from our unique vantage point as three
of Grossman’s former students and mentees. Owing to the sheer size of the relevant literature, we will
limit this review to infant health in high income countries as classified by the World Bank and highlight
salient examples rather than provide an exhaustive review. To the extent possible, we underscore work
by Grossman’s former students and protégés, whose research most directly stemmed from the source.
The origins of the infant health production function
Grossman published his now-classic treatise on the concept of health capital and the demand
for health in 1972 that was based on his 1970 doctoral dissertation, which was written under the
tutelage of Gary Becker. The health production framework follows from Becker’s path-breaking work
from the 1960s on the concepts of household production and human capital. According to Grossman’s
own account (Grossman 2004, p.631), “…Gary suggested the topic of my dissertation. Originally it was
supposed to be a study of the effects of education on health, but along the way he encouraged me to
broaden it into a theoretical and empirical analysis of the demand for health.”
While most of Grossman’s early studies on the production of health considered individuals’
production of their own health, in the 1980s he considered the production of health across generations
by investigating effects of maternal inputs on infant health outcomes. Since the first published paper
with this focus in the economics literature, Grossman and Jacobowitz*(1981) 1, research on infant health
production has grown substantially, expanding in both breadth of application and methodological

sophistication. Below we briefly describe the economic model of infant health production, then present
a systematic review and synthesis of the literature from the 1980s through 2016 and conclude by
discussing by new directions in this line of research.
Infant health production function model
Following Corman, Joyce, and Grossman (1987) and the theoretical literature on which they
build, parents’ utility can be expressed as a function of consumption goods (C), infant health (Hi),
parents’ health (Hp), tastes, and any other relevant arguments as follows: 2
(1)

U=U (C, Hi, Hp, tastes)

Infant health is a function of prenatal inputs (which can be positive, such as prenatal care, or negative,
such as smoking or drug use) as well as the health endowment of the mother (which reflects Hp and
may affect her reproductive efficiency), as shown in the infant health production function that follows:
(2)

Hi = f (input1, input2, ….inputn, maternal health endowment)

The demand for each input can be expressed as follows:
(3)

Inputi = gi (price and availability of inputi, prices and availability of substitute and
complementary inputs, income, maternal health endowment, tastes, wantedness)

Thus, infant health is an argument in the parent's utility function (Equation 1), and the parents’
utility maximization is constrained by the process underlying the production of infant health (Equation
2). Wantedness reflects the relative importance of infant health versus other factors (e.g., own health)
in the parent's utility function and therefore impacts prenatal input use (Equation 3) and other
investments in infant health that may be unobserved. The maternal health endowment enters the infant
health production directly (through biological processes) and may also affect infant health indirectly
through the use of prenatal inputs (e.g., mothers with poor health endowments may attempt to offset
an expected unfavorable birth outcome by utilizing more healthy inputs). Maternal risk-taking and time

preference (taste for risky behaviors) affect maternal engagement in risky behaviors (such as smoking
and drug use) and investments in own health, which in turn can impact infant health production directly
through the maternal health endowment (Equation 2) or indirectly through the maternal health
endowment or other inputs (Equation 3).
Most empirical studies based on the infant health production function framework use reduced
form models, derived by substituting Equation 3 into Equation 2 (that is., these models include
measures of availability of inputs, rather than inputs themselves) or models that directly include the
inputs of interest (Equation 2). For example, for studies exploring the effects of prenatal care, reduced
form models may include availability of prenatal care services as the treatment of interest, while
structural production function models would include a direct measure of prenatal care use. Direct
estimation of Equation 2 may produce biased estimates owing to the potential endogeneity of input
demand and non-random selection into the use of positive or negative inputs (i.e., investment in a
specific input such as prenatal care may be correlated with other unobserved inputs or maternal
characteristics that are associated with infant health). For this reason, some studies use instrumental
variables for the treatment of interest in the attempt to obtain unbiased estimates. Continuing with the
example of prenatal care, some studies use two-stage models that estimate prenatal care use as a
function of availability of prenatal care services or other relevant factors (version of Equation 3) and
then use the predicted values of prenatal care to estimate the infant health outcome (Equation 2), and
some other studies use hybrid or quasi-reduced form models that include direct measures of some
inputs while using availability for others—substituting Equation 3 into Equation 2 for some inputs
(usually the input of interest) but not for others. Below, we provide a systematic literature review that
traces the evolution of the topics, data sources, and methods characterizing the economics literature to
date on infant health production.
Systematic literature review
5

We used EconLit to identify original published research articles from 1980 through 2016 that
met the following conditions:
1. Published in economics journals (i.e., journals with the word “economic” or “economics” in
their titles, Journal of Human Resources, or Journal of Human Capital) or were explicitly based on the
economic health production framework.
2. Focused on infant outcomes (as opposed to health of older children).
3. Studied high income countries as designated by the World Bank (World Bank Group, 2017).
4. Focused on health outcomes rather than health disparities.
5. Based on data from the second half of the twentieth century or later, as opposed to more
historical data.
We arrived at a list of 147 articles that met these criteria, all of which were directly or indirectly
influenced by Michael Grossman. These articles are summarized in Tables 1-4, which cover the 1980s,
1990s, 2000s, and 2010-2016, respectively. In subsequent sections, we synthesize each of these tables in
turn, highlighting prominent patterns.
1980s: Early studies
Most of the studies in this formative decade used data at the county or state level; estimated
direct, reduced form, or 2-stage production functions; and considered infant mortality or birthweightrelated outcomes, as detailed in Table 1. In terms of inputs, most studies focused on prenatal care,
cigarette smoking, and/or availability of various inputs including prenatal care services, community
health centers, family planning and abortion services, prenatal nutrition programs, and neonatal
intensive care units. Fuchs (1986) and Joyce,* Grossman & Goldman* (1989) were prescient of
developments to come in that they focused on low level radiation exposures and pollution, respectively,
as inputs.

6

The first study of infant health production in the economics literature, Grossman and
Jacobowitz* (1981), used county level data to explore determinants of neonatal mortality rates and
found that an increase in the legal abortion rate appeared to be the single most important factor,
dominating over schooling and poverty [1].3 A subsequent study by Rosenzweig and Schultz (1983) used
individual-level data from the 1967-69 National Natality Followback Survey, considered birthweightrelated outcomes rather than infant mortality, and highlighted and addressed (to the extent possible at
the time) the issue of endogeneity of prenatal inputs [2]. Rosenzweig and Schultz estimated that
prenatal cigarette smoking decreased birthweight by 260 grams and that 5 months of prenatal care
delay decreased birthweight by 230 grams, while Corman,* Joyce* and Grossman (1987) found small
estimated effects of prenatal care compared to those of smoking when focusing on a measure of early
prenatal care (first trimester care) [5]. A consistent finding across studies in this decade was that
abortion availability was strongly associated with favorable birth outcomes [1, 2, 5-7], the hypothesized
mechanism (i.e., argument in the production function, Equation 2 above) being wantedness. Another
consistent finding was that measures of access to health care—including community health centers,
Medicaid, and neonatal intensive care—appeared to be important.
Overall, this formative decade in the economics of infant health production provided key
building blocks that set the stage for decades of research to come. Most of these early studies used
aggregate data, which can provide a sense of the importance of specific inputs at the population level,
but not of direct effects on individuals. The infant health production function research in this initial
decade, which came at the heels of the legalization of abortion after Roe v. Wade in 1973, strongly
suggested the importance of abortion availability for birth outcomes. This small and very new literature
also suggested the importance of prenatal cigarette smoking and access to health care.

The 1990s saw substantial and widespread improvements in computing capabilities, which
allowed researchers to handle exponentially larger data sets, vastly increased the speed of data
manipulation, facilitated linkages between administrative datasets, and made it possible to geocode
individual-level data and attach area-level characteristics. This development advanced research on
infant health production in particular by allowing for analyses at the individual level, consideration of
previously unexplored inputs and outcomes, and—perhaps most notably—the use of instrumental
variables (IVs) to address the endogeneity of inputs. The majority of studies in the 1990s used
administrative data, including micro-level data from U.S. natality files (sometimes linked to infant
mortality files), state Medicaid files, and linked administrative datasets from various states. For example,
studies used linked birth and hospital discharge records from New Jersey [28] and linked Medicaid and
birth records from New York City [29, 36] and California [31]. A few studies used national survey data,
including the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) [16, 17] and National Maternal and
Infant Health Survey (NMIHS) [33, 37]. One article was based on data from a clinical study that took
place at large municipal hospitals [27]. The set of infant health outcomes investigated in the 1990s was
largely the same as in the previous decade, but a few studies now incorporated length of newborn
hospital stay and newborn hospitalization costs as proxies for infant morbidity [22, 28] and one study
considered sudden infant deaths instead of infant mortality more generally [19]. Two studies were
based on data from high income countries other than the U.S. (Australia, England, and Wales [19];
Canada [26]).
A defining characteristic of the infant health production literature in the 1990s, reflecting a new
era of policy experimentation in the U.S., was that studies started focusing on policy changes or
variations related to input availability and prices (e.g., Medicaid expansions and healthcare delivery
systems; restriction on abortions under Medicaid; Medicaid fee schedules; and cigarette taxes). This
new crop of studies led to more broad-based attention to the infant health production literature, as it
8

provided evidence on the effectiveness of policies of interest to legislators and program directors in
addition to providing information of interest to economists about the roles of various inputs. In addition,
researchers continued to study the prenatal inputs that were investigated in the 1980s, but extended
the set to include prenatal illicit drug use [22, 23, 27] in the aftermath of the crack epidemic in the U.S.,
as well as income-related inputs [12, 16, 17], and augmented Medicaid prenatal care services [28, 36].
Prenatal care (use, eligibility, scope) was a major focus in this decade.
Along with better data, estimation methods evolved. Simultaneous equation models became
more prevalent and sophisticated, and the decade saw many studies utilizing instrumental variables (IV)based methods to address non-random selection into prenatal inputs. For instance, Grossman and
Joyce* [11] was the first study to address both the endogeneity of prenatal care in the birthweight
production function and the selection of pregnancies into those that result in live births within a
simultaneous three-equation framework that was identified by IVs and exclusion restrictions. This
embedding of the infant health production function within a Heckman selection model continued to
guide some research in this decade that focused on prenatal care and abortion services [30, 32]. As the
1990s progressed and witnessed an expansion in our understanding and application of IV methods (see,
for example, Angrist and Krueger (2001) for a history of instrumental variables), this evolution extended
to the literature on infant health production, particularly studies that came out in the latter half of the
decade. Many of these studies exploited state or local policy variation that was prevalent in the 1990s as
IVs. For example, one influential study constructed a simulated Medicaid eligibility instrument from
state program rules, capitalizing on the differential timing of the Medicaid expansions across states over
the late 1980s to early 1990s to estimate the causal effects of insurance access on infant health [25].
This innovation, of creating a simulated eligibility instrument that collapsed multi-dimensional program
rules into a single variable that plausibly reflected shifts in the program rules over time and was
orthogonal to the pregnant woman’s individual characteristics, has been used in many studies
9

thereafter. Another study exploited state variation in cigarette excise taxes as IVs and was one of the
seminal studies quantifying the causal effects of prenatal smoking on birthweight [35]. Another
noteworthy study in this vein exploited state variation in AFDC program rules as IVs to estimate the
effects of welfare participation on birthweight [16].
Whereas the majority of studies in 1980s considered multiple inputs, those in the 1990s (and
beyond) started focusing on one input with the goal of identifying causal effects. Studies generally found
smaller effect sizes for prenatal care than were found by Rosenzweig and Schultz for an earlier (preMedicaid expansion) cohort, although comparisons across studies for this particular input are difficult
because (1) studies often used different measures of prenatal care, (2) studies using IV methods
addressed endogeneity but tended to produce estimates that were imprecise, and (3) it is plausible that
the effects of prenatal care on birth outcomes changed over time (i.e., as prenatal care became more
widely used as a result of the Medicaid eligibility expansions in the 1980s, the effects on birth outcomes
may have become smaller, as women most likely to benefit gained access to care). Child Trends (2015)
reported that about 8% of infants born in the U.S. in 1970 (close to the Rosenzweig and Schultz cohort)
had mothers who initiated prenatal care after the second trimester of pregnancy, while the
corresponding figure in 1999 was about 4%—representing a decrease of 50 percent. In addition,
measures of the timing of initiation of prenatal care do not speak to the quality of that care; one study
of augmented Medicaid prenatal care (versus standard Medicaid prenatal care), which included case
management services and referrals to other programs, found some evidence of improvements in birth
outcomes above and beyond what could plausibly be attributed to timing of care initiation [28]. Finally,
prenatal care may operate through indirect channels, wherein greater contact between expectant
mothers and physicians could lead to decreases (increases) in health-compromising (health-promoting)
behaviors such as smoking (better diet and nutrition). For example, if reductions in prenatal smoking are
a mechanism through which prenatal care improves birth outcomes, then studies that control for
10

prenatal smoking would underestimate the effects of prenatal care on infant health outcomes. Thus,
some of the differences in the estimated effects of prenatal care across studies may reflect variations in
controls for other prenatal behaviors.
Prenatal cigarette smoking was not frequently studied in this decade, although interest in this
input picked up in the subsequent decades with an increasing number of successful state lawsuits
against the tobacco industry; the main estimate from this decade—based on individual level natality
data and IV models—was that any prenatal smoking led to a reduction in birthweight of between 350
and 600 grams [35]; representing a 10-18% reduction compared to the mean birthweight of 3,365 grams
in the U.S. in 1990 (Martin et al., 2005).
Key policy findings in this decade were that expanding Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women
led to reductions in infant mortality [25] and that augmented prenatal care programs for pregnant
women on Medicaid led to improvements in a number of different birth outcomes [28, 36]. The effects
of Medicaid eligibility and content of care on infant mortality could operate through birthweight-related
outcomes or through postnatal access to care or infant exposures. In regard to the latter, Reichman et
al. (2010), using a multi-pronged approach to address the potential endogeneity of the timing of
prenatal care, found that first trimester prenatal care leads to decreased maternal postpartum smoking,
increased use of well-baby care, and possibly increased breastfeeding.
2000s: Branching out with focus on plausible estimates
Economic research on infant health production further evolved substantially in the aughts
decade. New focuses were on exposures to pollution [46, 57, 78, 84], sanitation interventions [65], and
weather events [79], with the last serving as a proxy for prenatal stress. The (by now) routine and
efficient practice of geocoding data greatly facilitated this research. These more “passive” exposures are
both policy relevant and arguably less endogenous to the infant health outcome compared to inputs
directly invested by the expectant mother. Research in this decade also focused on a broader range of
11

policies including those related to malpractice liability [42], hospital discharge laws [71], tort reform [70]
immigration [45], welfare [38, 60, 73], smoking restrictions [75], minimum legal drinking age (MLDA)
laws [80], and parental leave [40, 63]. In terms of the health production model, the first three policies
(malpractice, tort, and discharge laws) may affect the quality of inputs in the production of health.
Smoking restrictions and MLDA laws may affect the demand for tobacco and alcohol. Welfare policy may
affect the demand for health inputs through income and time constraints, and potentially through
access to health insurance, or can have direct effects on infant health through prenatal stress. Policies
that restrict access to public insurance for immigrants may affect the demand for medical inputs among
both immigrants (through loss of public insurance) and non-immigrants (through less competition for
prenatal services). More generous parental leave policies allow greater postnatal parental time inputs
into the production of infant health.
Again, compared to direct input use, laws are arguably less endogeneous to infant health
outcomes. Many studies continued to focus on the same inputs as in previous decades (e.g., Medicaid
availability/fees/managed care, wantedness, cigarette smoking, illicit drugs, cigarette taxes, and
nutrition policy), but with new data sources and methods. In addition, some studies focused specifically
on the role of education [47, 64], which had routinely been included in models in the past but generally
as a control variable, and other sources of human capital (e.g., maternal pre-pregnancy physical and
mental health endowment [83] and maternal prenatal depression [50]). Finally, some studies focused on
specific prenatal medical inputs (e.g., relevant prescription drugs [56]) and paternal factors such as
paternal education, race/ethnicity, and age [83].
With increasingly rich data and an evolution of thought about the processes leading to infant
health, the outcomes in this decade expanded beyond infant mortality (the most extreme outcome) and
birthweight-related outcomes to include fetal deaths, birth length, infant malformations, newborn
hospital readmissions, Apgar scores, and specific infant morbidities. Although birthweight is a widely
12

used and well measured index of subsequent morbidity and a valuable outcome in its own right, it is not
a direct measure of infant health. Low birthweight is a strong risk factor for infant mortality and
morbidity among survivors, but many low birthweight children (even the very lightest) have no serious
health problems (Reichman, 2005). Thus, using birthweight or low birthweight to proxy infant health can
lead to imprecise or biased estimates of the effects of inputs on infant health. The literature is mixed on
the associations between Apgar scores (an index assessing the clinical status of the infant immediately
after birth and the need for intervention to augment breathing) and subsequent morbidity and mortality
(e.g., AAP 2015); as such, that measure may lack precision and lead to biased estimates. One
noteworthy study included a very specific and well-measured indicator of whether the infant had any
serious abnormal health condition soon after birth (12% of their sample) and found that while similar
inferences could be made about the effects of prenatal drug use on infant health when using
birthweight-related outcomes and when using the direct measure of infant health, the same was not
true for prenatal smoking; specifically, the effect of smoking on low birthweight was large and positive
but on the direct measure of infant health was zero [83]. This study was the very last in our systematic
review that estimated single-equation production functions, but the authors were able to use very rich
data and incorporate theoretically important but typically unobserved factors into their models and the
findings underscore that estimates should be interpreted in the context of the specific outcomes that
are modeled.
In addition to the data sources used in previous decades, studies in the aughts used data from a
randomized clinical trial of a prenatal smoking cessation program [44], the Pregnancy Risk Assessment
Monitoring System [54], the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing survey [83], restricted hospital data
from California [71], the Pregnancy Nutrition Surveillance System [72], and WIC records [81]. Although
most of the studies focused on U.S. settings, a few used data from other countries—specifically Canada
[56], Spain [69], and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries [63].
13

The methodologies employed in these studies continued to evolve, with a greater focus on
credible identification strategies and deriving plausible causal estimates. The growing importance placed
on internal validity necessitated that empirical studies of infant health production focus on a single input
and cleanly identify the causal effect of that input. Studies in this decade continued to apply IV-based
methods based on both program rules as well as other sources of variation. For example, one of the first
national studies on how medical malpractice premiums affect prenatal care use and infant health took
place in this decade [42]. In that study, the authors addressed the endogeneity of malpractice premiums
for obstetricians by using state laws related to tort reform and malpractice premiums for neurosurgeons
as IVs. Other influential studies exploited differential variation in the number of new 2- and 4-year
college openings across U.S. counties to identify the effects of maternal education [47], and declines in
total suspended particulates across counties (owing to the 1981-82 recession) to identify the effects of
pollution [46], on infant health outcomes. The use of panel data and fixed effects models (with area
fixed effects or maternal fixed effects) was also quite common in this decade, and studies further
exploited natural and/or policy experiments in conjunction with panel data to estimate difference-indifferences (DD) models. For example, a noteworthy study brought new evidence to bear on the
question of how access to quality care and provider choice impact infant health, by exploiting an
exogenous policy change in California that raised Medicaid payments to hospitals and therefore raised
the incentives and willingness of hospitals to serve Medicaid patients [53]; the authors capitalized on
this natural experiment within a DD framework by comparing differences in birth outcomes for Medicaid
mothers (treatment group) to privately-insured mothers (control group) across areas that witnessed
larger declines in segregation (Medicaid births clustered at only public hospitals) vs. areas with little or
no decline in segregation from the change in Medicaid payments. Another study exploited differences in
the timing of WIC enrollment, comparing women who enrolled in WIC during the prenatal period across

14

different trimesters (treated group) with women who did not enroll in WIC until postpartum (control
group) to assess how program participation affects infant health [72].
The aughts also marked the beginnings of a shift from estimating just an average treatment
effect to assessing heterogeneity across relevant population subgroups. One of the earliest studies to
estimate heterogeneous effects of maternal inputs, specifically maternal education and prenatal care,
used quantile regression methods [41]. While that study did not address the endogeneity of maternal
inputs (rather, it included multiple inputs and treated them as exogenous), it underscored the important
point that the mean effect of any input may mask considerable heterogeneity across the birthweight
distribution. A study a few years later applied a finite mixture model to assess heterogeneity in the
causal effect of an input while treating the input as endogenous, necessitating a focus only on one input
(in this case, prenatal care) and omitting other maternal inputs and behaviors [55]. This study provided
one potential explanation for why some previous work had uncovered only weak effects of prenatal care
on infant health—specifically, that prenatal care has beneficial health effects for “normal” pregnancies
but may appear to be ineffective when a sample includes “complicated” pregnancies that may be
relatively unaffected by prenatal care.
Overall, the literature in this decade marched on to include a broader range of inputs (although
there was no dominant focus in this regard), outcomes, data sources, and methods and produced an
olio of findings. There was increased attention to magnitudes and precision of estimates. Most of the
relevant studies in this decade found small estimated effects of prenatal care (measured various ways)
on birth outcomes. The estimated effect of prenatal smoking on birthweight, from a clinical trial of a
smoking cessation program, was a reduction of 350 grams [44], which is in the ballpark of the original
Rosenzweig and Schultz estimate. Although there had been no significant findings of unemployment on
birth outcomes prior to this decade, studies now found that recession-induced decreases in pollution led
to decreases in infant mortality [46] and that high unemployment rates led to more favorable birth
15

outcomes [51]. The latter finding was consistent with the emerging broader literature indicating that
recessions can be good for your health (e.g., Ruhm, 2000a).
2010-2016: Infant health production meets lifecourse and intergenerational health research
While empirical research in most fields within economics, and in the social sciences in general,
has expanded in similar and corresponding ways (e.g., better and more available data, computing
capabilities, and methodological techniques), the current decade of infant health production research is
experiencing a unique, and perhaps its most dramatic, evolution. Not only have the boundaries
continued to expand (e.g., in terms of scope and methods), but infant health production research has
been integrating with the broader literature on intergenerational health. Specifically, recent studies in
economics have focused on the mother’s pre-conceptional or early childhood health [106] and the
child’s in-utero exposures, including pollution [86, 96, 97, 108, 112, 125, 146], natural disasters [104,
105, 113], stressful events such as plant layoffs [129], and cortisol measurements of stress [141], as
inputs into the production of infant health. Another notable theme is that while most studies of infant
health production in earlier decades used U.S. data sources, those in the current decade (which have
explored a variety of different inputs, many old and many new) have been based on data from other
countries, including Taiwan, the UK, Canada, Chile, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Austria, the
Netherlands, and Spain. Thus, what started out as a small field has gotten much larger and has gone
global. For example, the number of studies that turned up in our search jumped from 10 in the 1980s, to
27 in the 1990s, 48 in the 2000s, and 62 in just the first 7 years of the current decade. When considering
the overall numbers, it is important to note that they are on the conservative side, as many articles
based on the infant health production function framework do not meet the relatively strict inclusion
criteria for our systematic literature review. For example, articles published in economics journals but
based on developing country settings, in which relevant inputs and production processes are quite
different than those in developed countries, are not included.
16

Aside from maternal pre-conceptional health and infant in-utero exposures, research on a
plethora of previously unstudied inputs and policies has been published in the current decade. Studies
have continued to focus on pollution, smoking, education, income, maternity stay laws, smoking bans in
workplaces and restaurants, the WIC program, and nutrition—in several cases using state-of-the-art
research designs, such as exploiting Ramadan as a natural experiment for prenatal nutrition [92, 135].
New policies that have been investigated include those that affect fertility and birth timing (e.g., a “baby
bonus” program [121] or tax benefits [126]), the federal food stamps program [94], the Earned Income
Tax Credit [133], changes in provisions the Hill-Burton Act of 1946 (which eliminated requirements for
private hospitals to admit charity care patients and therefore reduced access to care) [93], and laws
involving cigarette purchase age [127].
Recent studies have investigated the roles of sunshine [147] and specific prenatal
recommendations such as bed rest [132], as well as maternal earnings [137], maternal employment
[140], marital status/divorce [123], domestic violence [90], and bereavement (mother recently lost a
parent) [142]. Several studies have looked at aspects of obstetric and neonatal technology beyond those
that were the focus of earlier studies, including Caesarian section delivery [134], electronic medical
records [101], home versus hospital birth [131], availability of birth control pills [107], and the quality of
neonatal care [87, 95]. Finally, studies have explored the roles of the built environment, including access
to fast food [99]. Advances in technology and exogenous stressful events may shift the production
function, while employment, earnings, and marital status can affect both the demand for inputs and the
time spent in the production of infant health.
The most studied inputs in the current decade have been smoking and the physical
environment, but together, these inputs have been the focus of only about one quarter of the studies.
Income and employment became more of a focus. Maternal inputs, including smoking, nutrition and

17

prenatal care continued to be of interest. The infant health outcomes considered have not changed at
all and a few new U.S. survey datasets have been employed.
The research methods employed are another defining characteristic of the current decade. The
progression towards stronger emphasis on credible identification has continued, and has led studies
utilizing “big data” and rigorous quasi-experimental research designs such as regression discontinuity.
One of the early examples exploited hospital reimbursement rules in California to identify the causal
effect of postpartum hospital stay on hospital readmission and mortality rates [91]. In that study, the
authors capitalized on hospitals typically being reimbursed based on the number of days a patient
spends in the hospital, with days counted as midnights receiving care (i.e., an infant born just after
midnight would be covered for one additional night of care relative to an infant born just prior to
midnight). Another study used administrative data from Denmark coupled with an information shock to
obstetricians that discontinuously increased caesarean section (CS) rates for breech babies born at term
to assess how CS delivery affected the health of infants who are at the margin of having a CS vs. a
vaginal birth [134]. Yet another study applied an RD design to the question of how prenatal smoking
affects birthweight, a question previously studied through IV and other methods, by exploiting the
discontinuous shift in the cost of accessing cigarettes at the minimum legal purchase age [127]. Studies
have also continued to use longitudinal or panel data and quasi-experimental research designs from the
previous two decades including IV and DD methods, with many of these studies relying on multiple
strategies and identification checks. For example, one study used IV, DD, and maternal fixed effects
estimators, applied to population data from Norway, to explore how maternal stress during pregnancy
due to the death of one of her parents affects birth outcomes [142].
Overall, the 2010s have been a period of great expansion of the infant health production
literature. The field has gone truly global, capitalized on big data and increasingly sophisticated research

18

designs, and become an essential part of the broad and highly salient literature on intergenerational
health.
Conclusion
Much has been learned about determinants of infant health since Michael Grossman developed
and introduced the infant health production framework almost four decades ago. His framework has
(conservatively) been applied in hundreds—and more likely thousands—of research studies, many of
which have been conducted by Grossman’s academic descendants. From this body of work, several
broad themes emerge.
First, policies matter for infant health, particularly those affecting access to health care.
Healthcare access for pregnant women and children improved dramatically during the past 3-4 decades
and had positive effects on infant health. Although the estimated effects of prenatal care use on birth
outcomes have tended to be small in recent decades, late (or no) prenatal care initiation in the U.S.
decreased substantially during the 1990s and stood at less than 4% of all births in 2002 (no comparable
figures are available thereafter; see Child Trends Databank, 2015), leaving limited room for
improvements in this regard (although enhancements to the content and scope of prenatal care may be
promising strategies). Moreover, prenatal care may be “too little too late” to improve birth outcomes
for some women, who may enter pregnancy with a host of physical, mental, and psychosocial problems,
the effects of which cannot be addressed within the confines of a pregnancy. As found in a 2009 study
[85] and convincingly confirmed by recent studies linking maternal pre-conceptional and early childhood
health [106] and in-utero exposures [92, 96, 97, 104, 105, 108, 112, 141] to offspring birth outcomes,
women’s pre-pregnancy mental and physical health are important predictors of birth outcomes above
and beyond pregnancy-related health, suggesting that healthcare access and quality for young girls and
women of reproductive age is a promising strategy for improving infant health. The availability of

19

abortion services stands out as an important predictor of infant health, suggesting the importance of
access to family planning services—ideally as part of comprehensive and multifaceted health care.
Another theme that is obvious from this review is that prenatal smoking and other chemical
exposures compromise infant health. The most consistent metric for prenatal smoking is birthweight in
grams associated with any smoking during pregnancy, and the estimates have been in the “few hundred
grams” range (reductions in birthweight attributed to smoking) across four decades with evolving
methodological sophistication. Because there are (understandably) few randomized controlled trials of
the effects of prenatal smoking, the infant health production literature provides much of the evidence
base in this regard. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that estimates of the causal effect of prenatal
smoking on birthweight based on observational data and quasi-experimental evidence are close to
estimates derived from a randomized control trial of a smoking cessation intervention directed at
pregnant women [35]. Recent studies also provide strong evidence of the adverse effects of air
pollution on infant health, which may operate through fetal health or postnatal exposures. Sorting out
the various pathways underlying these effects is a potentially fruitful direction for future research, as is
explaining the largely inconsistent estimated effects of nutrition, education, and other less-studied
arguments in the infant health production function.
Other potentially fruitful directions for further research include the effects of pre-conceptional
and lifetime health care on birth outcomes (for reasons elucidated above); the roles of paternal factors,
which have scarcely been studied by economists while findings from other fields (e.g., occupational
health, psychology, and sociology) suggest that paternal biological, economic, social, and behavioral
inputs are important for children’s health; the potential roles of grandparents and social support (which
relates to the growing literature on social capital and health); the potential role of housing stability and
characteristics (very few studies in this regard came up in our systematic review and there is increasing
interest in the role of housing as both a resource and an environment on health); the potential
20

complementarity or substitutability of inputs (i.e., most studies consider inputs in isolation, while it is
possible that bundles of inputs are more important); and factors that may exacerbate or buffer the
effects of adverse exposures and enhance or mitigate the effects of favorable exposures. In addition, as
medical technology evolves (e.g., applications of genomics or targeted interventions), there will be
additional inputs to consider and possibly more precise measures of health in infancy. There is a lot of
work to do in coming decades, so Michael Grossman’s infant health production tree will undoubtedly
continue to branch out, fertilize new ideas, and have major impact.

Underreporting of maternal drug
use results in overestimate by a
magnitude of about 50% of actual
effect of drug use on BW
Increased BW, lower newborn
hospitalization costs and reduced
rates of LBW and VLBW for those
receiving enriched care, for blacks;
no evidence that enriched care was
associated with improved birth
outcomes or lower costs for whites
No significant associations between

Black mothers benefited most, with
largest decline in neonatal
mortality, but moved to better
hospitals at lower rates; all other

advantage of increased access
WIC participation reduces
probability that infant is LBW and
VLBW
Prenatal care (weeks delay) has
substantial effect on 'normal'
pregnancies (using finite mixture
model)
Increased spending on
pharmaceuticals improves infant
mortality rates
Significant adverse effect of carbon
monoxide (CO) exposure on infant
mortality; reduction in CO over

adequacy) prenatal behaviors also
appear to be important
Smoking reduces BW by 174 grams,

Doubling of livestock production
