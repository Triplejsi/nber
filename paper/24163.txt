Short- and Long-Horizon Behavioral Factors

NBER Working Paper No. 24163
December 2017, Revised February 2019
JEL No. G02,G12,G14
ABSTRACT
We propose a theoretically-motivated factor model based on investor psychology and assess its ability
to explain the cross-section of U.S. equity returns. Our factor model augments the market factor with
two factors which capture long- and short-horizon mispricing. The long-horizon factor exploits the
information in managers' decisions to issue or repurchase equity in response to persistent mispricing.
The short-horizon earnings surprise factor, which is motivated by investor inattention and evidence
of short-horizon underreaction, captures short-horizon anomalies. This three-factor risk-and-behavioral
model outperforms other proposed models in explaining a broad range of return anomalies.

In his 2011 Presidential Address to the American Finance Association, John Cochrane asks three
questions about what he describes as the “zoo” of new anomalies:
First, which characteristics really provide independent information about average
returns? Second, does each new anomaly variable also correspond to a new factor formed
on those same anomalies? Third, how many of these new factors are really important
(and can account for many characteristics)?
Several approaches to developing a parsimonious factor model have been proposed in the
literature. One approach is based upon rational asset pricing theory in an efficient market (Fama
and French, 2015, 2018; Hou, Xue, and Zhang, 2015). A second approach is to extract factors using a
statistical analysis of the returns to assets or characteristic-sorted portfolios, while potentially
imposing structural constraints implied by rational asset pricing theory (Kelly, Pruitt, and Su, 2017;
Freyberger, Neuhierl, and Weber, 2017; Kozak, Nagel, and Santosh, 2017; Lettau and Pelger, 2018).
Finally, Stambaugh and Yuan (2017) develop a set of “mispricing factors” using a purely empirical
approach of averaging characteristics known, from extant empirical research, to have power to
forecast the cross-section of average returns. As Stambaugh and Yuan (2017) put it, “Rather than
construct a factor using stocks rankings on a single anomaly variable, such as investment, we
construct a factor by averaging rankings across multiple anomalies” (p. 1271). They construct their
two factors using the 11 well-documented anomalies examined by Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2012,
2014, 2015).
In contrast with these approaches, we propose a model that supplements the market factor with
just two theory-based behavioral factors, and show that this model does a good job of explaining the
cross-section of expected returns. Building on past literature, our two behavioral factors are designed
to capture long- and short-horizon mispricing.
The novelty of our approach comes from motivating the factor model based upon different
forms of mispricing. Behavioral theories suggest distinct mispricing mechanisms that will correct at
shorter or longer horizon. For example, it has been hypothesized that investors with limited attention
underreact to public information that arrives at fairly high-frequency, such as quarterly earnings
announcements. Building on insights of Bernard and Thomas (1990), in the models of Hirshleifer
and Teoh (2003), DellaVigna and Pollet (2009), and Hirshleifer, Lim, and Teoh (2011), a subset of
investors fail to take into account the implications of the latest earnings surprises for future earnings.

As a consequence, stock prices underreact to earnings surprises, resulting in abnormal returns (the
post-earnings announcement drift anomaly, or PEAD). Such misperceptions about the subsequent
earnings should be corrected at reasonably short time horizons when new earnings are reported.
Consistent with this hypothesis, Ball and Brown (1968) and numerous other studies suggest that the
resulting mispricing is corrected over the next few quarterly earnings announcements.
In contrast, some biases will result in more persistent, longer-horizon mispricing. For example,
investors who are overconfident about their private information signals will overreact to these signals,
leading to a value effect wherein firms with high stock valuations relative to fundamental measures
subsequently experience low returns. Owing to overconfidence in their private signals, investors are
relatively unwilling to correct their perceptions as further (public) earnings news arrives. Indeed, in the
models of Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998) and Gervais and Odean (2001), the arrival of
new public information can temporarily increase overconfidence and mispricing. So the correction of
overconfidence-driven mispricing will take place over a much longer time horizon than mispricing that
derives solely from limited attention. The persistence associated with the value effect, for example,
suggests that this process can last for many years.1
Furthermore, in the model of Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998), there are regime shifting
beliefs about the nature of the earnings time series. An under-extrapolative belief regime (their
“mean-reverting” regime) leads to post-earnings announcement drift and momentum. In this regime
the positive returns that follow a positive earnings surprise dissipate rapidly when the next few earnings
surprises prove earnings to be higher than expected. In contrast their over-extrapolative (“trending”)
regime is more persistent, because a brief trend-opposing sequence of earnings surprises does not
provide sufficient evidence to overcome the extrapolative expectations investors have formed about
more distant earnings. We therefore identify a short-horizon and a long-horizon behavioral factor
which together capture both short- and long-horizon mispricing.
In behavioral models, return comovement can result from commonality in stock mispricing
1

A complicating issue is that some behavioral theories also use overconfidence to explain price momentum, which
is a short-horizon anomaly (lasting about a year). Empirically, part of the price momentum effect is explained by
earnings momentum (Chan, Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok, 1996), which is much like post-earnings announcement drift.
The remaining part of the price momentum effect, according to the Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998) model,
derives from dynamic patterns of shifts in overconfidence. This mechanism differs from both the short-run mechanism
of the limited attention theory for PEAD, and the long-run static overconfidence mechanism for the value effect and
financing anomalies.

(Barberis and Shleifer, 2003), as well as commonality in investor errors in interpreting signals about
fundamental economic factors (Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam, 2001).

Since mispricing

predicts future returns owing to subsequent correction, this implies that behavioral factors can be
used to construct a factor model that better describes the cross-section of expected returns.2 Just as
firms that are exposed to systematic risk factors earn an associated risk premium, firms that are
heavily exposed to behavioral factors earn a conditional return premium (see, e.g., the model of
Hirshleifer and Jiang (2010)). Fama and French (1993, 2015) construct risk factors based on firm
characteristics that they argue capture risk exposures; we instead supplement the market factor with
two behaviorally-motivated factors.

Here, we argue that the mispricing effects of numerous

behavioral biases, occurring at both long- and short-horizons, can be captured by two behavioral
factors: a financing factor FIN that captures long-horizon mispricing, and an inattention factor
PEAD that captures short-horizon mispricing.
Consistent with the behavioral theories discussed above, our long-horizon factor is based on the
intuition from the model of Stein (1996), who argues that when a firm becomes over- or underpriced,
the optimal response for the firm is to issue or repurchase its own stock, while not necessarily to
change its level of investment. Managers are well-positioned to lead their firms to act as arbitrageurs
of their own stock prices, since managers have superior information about the intrinsic value of their
firms. Even so, if investors were fully rational, they would fully impound the information contained in
a firm’s decision to issue or repurchase equity (Myers and Majluf, 1984), so that the financing decision
would not be a proxy for mispricing. However, in models of investor overconfidence, the market does
not fully impound this information. Empirically, there are on average persistent and strong negative
abnormal returns following issuance activity, and positive abnormal returns following repurchases.3
Precisely because the market underreacts to issuance/repurchase activity, it is in firms’ interests to
2

Several other studies also suggest that behavioral biases systematically affect asset prices. For example, Goetzmann
and Massa (2008) construct a behavioral factor from trades of disposition-prone investors and find that exposure to
this disposition factor seems to be priced. Similarly, Baker and Wurgler (2006) suggest including investor sentiment
in models of prices and expected returns, and Kumar and Lee (2006) find that retail investor sentiment leads to stock
return comovement incremental to market, size, value and momentum factors. Stambaugh and Yuan (2017) develop a
behavioral factor model based on commonality in mispricing.

engage in “market timing,” that is, issuing or repurchasing equity to exploit pre-existing mispricing.4,5
In essence, the argument here is that managers who do not fully share the market’s biased expectations
observe mispricing and exploit it in the interest of the existing shareholders who do not participate in
either the firm’s new issues or repurchases.
The intuition that issuance/repurchase activity is a catch-all for many possible sources of
“stubborn” investor misperceptions (those that are unlikely to be corrected by just a few more
earnings announcements) is key to our financing-based mispricing factor.

This hypothesis is

supported by the evidence of Greenwood and Hanson (2012), which suggests that managers exploit
mispricing that derives from many possible sources. Their measure of characteristic mispricing, the
issuer-repurchaser spread, is defined as the difference in a given characteristic (e.g., size) between
recent stock issuers and repurchasers. They find that this characteristic-spread measure forecasts the
corresponding characteristic-based factor returns for most of the characteristics they examine,
including book-to-market (i.e., HML) and size (i.e., SMB). For example, large firms underperform
after years when issuing firms are large relative to repurchasing firms.6

Here we go further by

showing that a factor model including a financing factor (constructed as the return spread between
recent issuers and repurchasers) can price numerous long-horizon anomaly portfolios. (As we discuss
momentarily, it cannot on its own price short-horizon anomaly portfolios.)
Our financing factor FIN is a composite of the 1-year net-share-issuance (NSI) and 5-year
composite-share-issuance (CSI) measures of Pontiff and Woodgate (2008) and Daniel and Titman
(2006), respectively. Following the approach of Fama and French (1993), our FIN factor portfolio is
based on two-by-three sort on size and the financing characteristic which is a 50/50 combination of
the NSI and CSI measures, and goes long the two value-weighted low-issuance portfolios and short
the two high-issuance portfolios. The choice to build our factor using the 50/50 combination of NSI
and CSI is based on robustness considerations. There are undoubtedly other combinations of these
4

Ritter (1991) and many others argue that firms may issue and repurchase shares to “time” share mispricing. Stein
(1996) develops a theoretical model of market timing. Empirical evidence suggests that firms issue equity when their
price-to-book ratio is high, and repurchase when they are low (Dong, Hirshleifer, and Teoh, 2012; Khan, Kogan, and
Serafeim, 2012); that these sales and repurchases forecast the firms’ future returns in a way that is consistent with market
timing; that earnings surprises tend to be more negative following equity issues (Denis and Sarin, 2001); and, in surveys,
that managers state that their issuance and repurchase activity is designed to exploit mispricing (Graham and Harvey,
2001). Baker and Wurgler (2002) provide a good summary of the evidence on market timing.
5
Alternatively, Eckbo, Masulis, and Norli (2000), Berk, Green, and Naik (1999) and Lyandres, Sun, and Zhang (2008)
propose or test risk-based explanations for the new issues anomaly.

Greenwood and Hanson (2012) examine seven characteristics: book-to-market, size, nominal share price, distress,
payout policy, profitability, and industry.

issuance metrics that might work better than our equal-weighted average, at least in-sample.
Consistent with its theoretical motivation, we find that our FIN factor captures predominantly
longer-term mispricing and correction (one year or longer). For several reasons, it is much less likely
to capture shorter-horizon mispricing.

Equity issuance and repurchase have disclosure, legal,

underwriting, and other costs that likely constrain firms from issuing to exploit very short-horizon
mispricing. There are also informational barriers to high-frequency issuance/repurchase strategies.
Owing to these frictions, such corporate events tend to occur only occasionally, rather than as
continuously updated responses to even transient changes in market conditions.7 In addition, the
fixed costs associated with initiating any issuance or repurchase program would constrain firms from
exploiting short-horizon mispricing.8
Because FIN is unlikely to capture shorter-horizon mispricing, we introduce a second
behavioral factor intended to capture short-term mispricing. Motivated by the theory that limited
investor attention induces stock market underreaction to earnings information (Hirshleifer and Teoh,
2003; DellaVigna and Pollet, 2009; Hirshleifer, Lim, and Teoh, 2011), we consider a post-earnings
announcement drift (PEAD) factor. PEAD is the phenomenon that firms that experience positive
earnings surprises subsequently earn higher returns than those with negative earnings surprises.
Bernard and Thomas (1989) argue that this return differential is not a rational risk premium, and
instead reflects delayed price response to information. A recent empirical literature suggests that this
delayed response derives from limited investor attention.9

If the source of PEAD is that some

investors neglect the implications of current earnings news for future earnings, any mispricing is
likely to be corrected as the next few earnings are announced. Indeed, the evidence indicates that
this correction is complete within a year (Bernard and Thomas, 1989).
7

U.S. regulation potentially creates substantial time lags in registering security issues. Issuance also subjects the firm
to possible investor skepticism about the possibility that firms with high value of assets in place are issuing to exploit
private information, as modeled by Myers and Majluf (1984). Flexibility in issuance timing can be increased through
shelf-registration, allowing firms to exploit even transient private information, but by the same token, investors are likely
to be especially skeptical when firms maintain such flexibility.
8
The larger the total mispricing, the greater the benefit to a firm of trading to exploit it. An anomaly in which
abnormal returns continue for 5 years represents a greater total mispricing than if a similar (or even somewhat smaller)
per-year abnormal return persists only a year.
9
For example, market reactions to earnings surprises are muted when the earnings announcement is released during
low-attention periods such as non-trading hours (Francis, Pagach, and Stephan, 1992; Bagnoli, Clement, and Watts, 2005),
Fridays (DellaVigna and Pollet, 2009), days with many same-day earnings announcements by other firms (Hirshleifer,
Lim, and Teoh, 2009), and in down market or low trading volume periods (Hou, Peng, and Xiong, 2009). At these times,
the immediate price and volume reactions to earnings surprises are weaker and the post-earnings announcement drift is
stronger.

We therefore hypothesize that PEAD reflects high-frequency systematic mispricing caused by
limited investor attention to earnings-related information, and use a PEAD factor to capture
comovement associated with high-frequency mispricing. Earnings announcements are of course not
the only source of fundamental news that investors might underreact to at a quarterly frequency.
However, earnings announcements provide an especially good window into short-term underreaction,
because they are highly relevant for fundamental value and arrive regularly for every firm each
quarter, and because all value-relevant news is ultimately manifested in earnings.
Our PEAD factor is constructed by going long firms with positive earnings surprises and short
firms with negative surprises. For robustness, PEAD, like FIN, is based on two-by-three sort on size
and earning-announcement returns, with value-weighted portfolios.
Our factor model supplements the market factor from the CAPM with these two behavioral
factors to form a three-factor risk-and-behavioral composite model, with behavioral factors designed
to capture common mispricing induced by investors’ psychological biases. This approach is consistent
with theoretical models in which both risk and mispricing proxies predict returns (Daniel, Hirshleifer,
and Subrahmanyam, 2001; Barberis and Huang, 2001; Kozak, Nagel, and Santosh, 2017). By using
both long- and short-horizon behavioral factors, we seek to capture both long-term mispricing that
takes a few years to correct and short-term mispricing that takes a few quarters to correct.
We empirically assess the incremental ability of behavioral factors to explain expected returns
relative to the factors used in other models, including both traditional factors (such as the market, size,
value, and return momentum factors) and other recently prominent factors (such as the investment and
profitability factors). Barillas and Shanken (2017) suggest that when comparing models with traded
factors, “...the models should be compared in terms of their ability to price all returns, both test assets
and traded factors.” To do this, we first run spanning tests to examine how well other (traded) factors
explain the performance of FIN and PEAD and vice versa. We find that a factor model that includes
both FIN and PEAD prices many of the traded factors proposed in the literature, including several of
the new factors proposed in Fama and French (2015), Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015), and Stambaugh
and Yuan (2017). In sharp contrast, reverse regressions show that other (traded) factors do not fully
explain the abnormal returns associated with FIN and PEAD.
We then explore the extent to which FIN and PEAD explain the returns of portfolios

constructed by sorting on the characteristics associated with well-known return anomalies.

We

consider 34 anomalies, closely following the list of anomalies considered in Hou, Xue, and Zhang
(2015). Since FIN and PEAD are designed to capture mispricing over different horizons, we are
especially interested in how well FIN captures long-horizon anomalies and how well PEAD captures
short-horizon anomalies. Therefore, we categorize the 34 anomalies into two groups: 12 short-horizon
anomalies including price momentum, earnings momentum, and short-term profitability, and 22
long-horizon anomalies including long-term profitability, value, investment and financing, and
intangibles.

We compare the performance of our three-factor composite model built on 3 firm

characteristics with recently proposed factor models: the four-factor model of Novy-Marx (2013,
NM4) built on 5 characteristics, the five-factor model of Fama and French (2015, FF5) built on 4
characteristics, the four-factor model of Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015, HXZ4) built on 3
characteristics, and the four-factor model of Stambaugh and Yuan (2017, SY4) built on 12
characteristics.10
We find that across the 12 short-horizon anomalies, the composite model fully captures all
anomalies at the 5% significance level (i.e., none have significant alphas). In contrast, 11 anomalies
have significant FF5 alphas, 2 have significant NM4 alphas, 1 has a significant HXZ4 alpha, and 4
have significant SY4 alphas. The mean |α̂| is lower for the composite model than for any of the four
alternative models. Finally, the Gibbons, Ross, and Shanken (1989, GRS) F -test fails to reject the
hypothesis that the 12 composite-model alphas are jointly zero, but rejects each of the four alternative
models at a 1% significance level.
The composite model also does a good job explaining the 22 long-horizon anomaly portfolios,
but for these portfolios the SY4 and NM4 models also perform well. For the composite model, 3
of the 22 alphas are significant at the 5% significance level. For competing models, the numbers of
significant alphas are 7 (FF5), 3 (NM4), 5 (HXZ4), 3 (SY4), etc. The GRS F -test that the 22 longhorizon anomaly portfolio alphas are jointly zero is not rejected for the SY4 model, and only rejected
at a 10% level for our composite model or the NM4 model. The GRS test does, however, reject this
null at a 1% significance level for both the FF5 and HXZ4 models. The good performance of the SY4
10
Consistent with convention in this literature since Fama and French (1993), both our FIN and PEAD factor portfolios
are based on bivariate (3×2) sorts on the relevant characteristic and firm size (i.e., Market Equity). In addition to
keeping in mind how many factors are in each model, to assess parsimony it is useful to bear in mind the number of firm
characteristics used to construct each factor model. We therefore provide characteristic counts for each model.

model appears to result primarily from the inclusion of their MGMT factor, which is constructed from
six characteristics associated with investment and financing.
Overall, across all 34 long- and short-horizon anomalies, our three-factor behavioral-composite
model performs well. Only 3 anomalies have 5% significant composite-model alphas. In comparison,
there are 18 significant FF5 alphas, 5 significant NM4 alphas, 6 significant HXZ4 alphas, and 7
significant SY4 alphas. The composite model also gives the smallest GRS F -statistic. The composite
model therefore outperforms both standard and recent enhanced factor models in explaining the large
set of anomalies studied in Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015). This evidence is consistent with the hypothesis
that many existing anomalies, such as momentum, profitability, value, investment and financing, and
intangibles, can be attributed to systematic mispricing.
Thus, relative to other proposed factor models, our composite model prices both short- and
long-horizon anomalies at least as well. Our model is motivated by theory, and is arguably more
parsimonious.11

Because our composite model is motivated by just two hypotheses—that firm

managers time issuance to arbitrage longer-horizon mispricing and that shorter-horizon mispricing
results from inattention—our model requires just two behavioral factors in addition to the market
factor. The competing models we examine all use either more factors, more characteristics, or both.
Why do just two proxies for mispricing (external financing and earnings surprises) capture a
wide set of anomalies? These proxies can capture misperceptions deriving from multiple behavioral
biases, each somewhat different. However, to the extent that a firm’s manager is aware of that firm’s
total mispricing—resulting from this variety of biases—and attempts to arbitrage this mispricing via
issuance/repurchase activities (the scale of which is proportional to the magnitude of the
mispricing), our long-horizon behavioral factor FIN can provide a good summary of the various
sources of longer-term mispricing.12 Similarly, to the extent that short-horizon anomalies derive from
psychological biases that induce underreaction to fundamentals, a firm’s earnings information may
11

Evaluating parsimony requires care, since it is well known that any pattern of returns can be “explained” ex post by
a single-factor model in which the factor is the ex-post mean-variance efficient portfolio (see also the discussion of NovyMarx (2016)). Still, when factors are built from characteristics, it is likely that the use of more characteristics and/or
more factors tends to grant greater freedom to overfit the cross-section of returns. Certainly a focus of the empirical
factor pricing literature since Fama and French (1992) has been on identifying models that explain the cross-section of
returns with a small number of factors, presumably owing to a preference for parsimony.
12
Although models of overconfidence offer a motivation for seeking a factor based on long-horizon mispricing, the
market timing motivation for the FIN factor means that it does not directly pinpoint what investor psychological bias is
driving mispricing.

be a good summary of higher-frequency information about firm value that investors misvalue, in
which case loadings on the PEAD factor may do a good job of capturing such mispricing.
To further evaluate the performance of our composite factor model, we perform cross-sectional
tests.

If FIN and PEAD are indeed priced behavioral factors that capture commonality in

mispricing, then behavioral models imply that firm loadings on FIN and PEAD should be proxies for
underpricing. In particular, FIN loadings are proxies for persistent underpricing and PEAD loadings
for transient underpricing. In consequence, these loadings should positively predict the cross-section
of stock returns.
The dynamic nature of mispricing implies that any given firm’s loadings on behavioral factors
will vary substantially over time. We therefore estimate firms’ loadings on these factors using daily
stock returns over a short horizon, e.g., one month. Using Fama and MacBeth (1973) cross-sectional
regressions, we find that FIN loadings significantly predict future stock returns, even after controlling
for most of the 34 anomaly characteristics that we examine. In contrast, estimated PEAD loadings
have no incremental power to forecast future returns. As we discuss in Section 3, the problems are
estimation error when PEAD loadings are unstable, and the heavy influence of small illiquid firms in
Fama-MacBeth regression tests.
Furthermore, we find that consistent with behavioral models, the return predictability associated
with FIN and PEAD factors is increasing with proxies for limits to arbitrage. These implications do
not hold for effects in rational frictionless models of risk premia.
Finally, the observed premia of the behavioral factors we propose could alternatively be
interpreted as rational risk premia. This mirrors the fact that the factors in traditional models
(other than the market factor) can instead be interpreted as reflecting mispricing. However, we
motivate our two behavioral factors with behavioral/mispricing arguments.

Following Daniel,

Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (2001) and Kozak, Nagel, and Santosh (2018), in a setting in which
investors with biased expectations coexist with unbiased (rational) arbitrageurs, the presence of the
arbitrageurs ensures that there are no pure arbitrage opportunities. This will necessarily link the
covariance structure and the expected returns of the individual assets; that is, behavioral factors will
be priced, and the Sharpe ratios associated with the behavioral factors will be bounded.

The

loadings on the behavioral factors will correctly price individual securities, but the factors themselves

will not necessarily covary with aggregate fundamental risks, as would the risk factors in a fully
rational setting with no biased investors.
For example, they will not covary with innovations in marginal utility based on aggregate
consumption. However, the factors should covary with measures of the innovations in marginal
utility for the subset of arbitrageurs in the economy. For example, to the extent that broker-dealers
act as rational arbitrageurs, broker-dealer leverage should price behavioral anomalies, in that it
captures “risk” for these agents (He and Krishnamurthy, 2013; Adrian, Etula, and Muir, 2014; He,
Kelly, and Manela, 2017). Indeed one interpretation of our long-horizon behavioral factor FIN is that
it captures the first-order condition for a rational optimizing firm in a setting such as that of Stein
(1996), in which mispricing of a firm’s issued securities is driven by behavioral biases.
We are not the first to construct a PEAD factor or a financing factor. Our contribution is to use
these factors in a theoretically motivated and parsimonious factor pricing model, to show that such a
model explains a broad range of both short- and long-horizon anomalies.13
A growing literature seeks to explain a wide set of anomalies with a small set of factors. This
is the motivation for the tests of Fama and French (1996), and more recently Novy-Marx (2013),
Fama and French (2015, 2018), Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015), and Stambaugh and Yuan (2017). Our
paper goes further in three key ways. First, we identify a strong dichotomy between short- and longhorizon anomalies, with short-horizon anomalies predominantly explained by our PEAD-based factor,
and long-horizon anomalies predominantly explained by the financing factor. Second, our approach is
distinct from this literature, in that our behavioral factors are based on theoretical arguments as to
what variables should capture long- and short-horizon mispricing. Finally, as noted earlier, our factor
model provides a better fit to a wide set of anomalies and factors.
13

Chordia and Shivakumar (2006) and Novy-Marx (2015a) construct PEAD factors and argue that the predictive
power of past returns is subsumed by a zero-investment portfolio based on earnings surprises. Novy-Marx (2015b) uses a
PEAD factor to price the ROE factor of Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015). Hirshleifer and Jiang (2010) propose a behavioral
factor, the underpriced-minus-overpriced (UMO) factor, based on firms’ external financing activities, such as debt/equity
repurchase and issuance events over the previous 24 months.

Comparison of Behavioral Factors with Other Factors

1.1

Factor Definitions
We construct the financing factor (FIN) based on the 1-year net share issuance (NSI) and

5-year composite share issuance (CSI) measures of Pontiff and Woodgate (2008) and Daniel and
Titman (2006), respectively. Daniel and Titman’s 5-year CSI measure is simply the firm’s 5-year
growth in market equity, minus the 5-year equity return, in logs. Thus, any issuance activity such as
seasoned issues, the exercise of employee stock options, and equity-financed acquisitions will increase
the issuance measure, while activity such as share repurchases, cash dividends, and other actions that
pay cash out of the firm will decrease the issuance measure. Note that corporate actions such as splits
and stock dividends don’t affect the market capitalization or the return, and thus leave the composite
issuance measure unchanged. Pontiff and Woodgate’s NSI measure is identical to CSI, except that NSI
uses a 1-year horizon and excludes cash dividends. Both issuance measures earn significant abnormal
returns (incremental to each other) during our sample period of 1972 to 2014. Details on variable
construction are provided in Appendix A.14
As noted above, the key differences between CSI and NSI are the horizons and the treatment of
cash dividends. It seems plausible that managers might adjust dividend policy to respond to mispricing
at a roughly 5-year horizon, but that frictions would constrain managers from adjusting dividends to
respond to mispricing at annual horizon. Empirically, dividend yields do in fact forecast returns at
longer horizons. To minimize data mining, we have elected to construct FIN based on NSI and CSI
measures identical to those used in the Pontiff and Woodgate (2008) and Daniel and Titman (2006)
studies. Our procedure of combining two existing financing measures off the shelf from existing papers
eliminates numerous potential degrees of freedom in how a researcher might potentially form a FIN
factor by tweaking existing financing measures.
The FIN factor is constructed using all NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ common stocks with
CRSP share codes of 10 or 11. Following Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015), we exclude financial firms and
firms with negative book equity. At the end of each June, we assign these firms to one of the two
size groups (small “S” and big “B”) based on whether that firm’s market equity is below or above the
14

Pontiff and Woodgate (2008) note that Daniel and Titman’s 5-year composite issuance measure, while strong in the
post-1968, is weak pre-1970; see also Daniel and Titman (2016).

NYSE median size breakpoint. Independently, we sort firms into one of the three financing groups
(low “L”, middle “M”, or high “H”) based on 1-year NSI and 5-year CSI, respectively. The three
financing groups are created based on an index of NSI and CSI rankings.
Specifically, we first sort firms into three CSI groups (low, middle, or high) using 20% and 80%
breakpoints for NYSE firms. Special care is needed when sorting firms into NSI groups, since about
one quarter of our NSI observations are negative (i.e., are repurchasing firms). If we were to use
NYSE 20% and 80% breakpoints to assign NSI groups, then in some formation years we would have
all repurchasing firms in the bottom 20% group, without differentiating between firms with high and
low repurchases. Similarly, on the issuance side, using a simple NSI sort would cause no distinction
between large and small issuances in some formation years. To address this, each June we separately
sort all repurchasing firms (with negative NSI) into two groups using the NYSE median breakpoint,
and sort all issuing firms (with positive NSI) into three groups using NYSE 30% and 70% breakpoints.
We then assign the repurchasing firms with the most negative NSI to the low NSI group, the issuing
firms in the top group to the high NSI group, and all other firms to the middle group.
Finally, we assign firms into one of the three financing groups (low “L”, middle “M”, or high
“H”) based on an index of NSI and CSI rankings. If a firm belongs to the high group by both NSI
and CSI rankings, or to the high group by NSI rankings while missing CSI rankings due to missing
data (or vice versa), the firm is assigned to the high financing group (“H”). If a firm belongs to the
low group by both NSI and CSI rankings, or to the low group by one ranking while missing the other,
it is assigned to the low financing group (“L”). In all other cases, firms are assigned to the middle
financing group (“M”).
Six portfolios (SL, SM, SH, BL, BM, and BH) are formed based on the intersections of size and
financing groups, value-weighted portfolio returns are calculated for each month from July to the next
June, and the portfolios are rebalanced at the end of the next June. The FIN factor return each month
is calculated as average return of the low financing portfolios (SL and BL) minus average return of
the high financing portfolios (SH and BH), that is, F IN = (rSL + rBL )/2 − (rSH + rBH )/2.
PEAD is the post-earnings announcement drift factor, which is intended to capture investor
limited attention. It is again constructed in the fashion of Fama and French (1993). Following Chan,
Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok (1996), earnings surprise is measured as the four-day cumulative abnormal

12

return around the most recent quarterly earnings announcement date (COMPUSTAT quarterly item
RDQ).15 Specifically,

CARi =

d=1
X

(Ri,d − Rm,d ),

d=−2

where Ri,d is stock i’s return on day d and Rm,d is the market return on day d relative to the earnings
announcement date. We require valid daily returns on at least two of the trading days in this four-day
window. We also require the COMPUSTAT earnings date (RDQ) to be at least two trading days prior
to the month end. In forming the PEAD portfolio, we sort on CARi from the most recent earnings
announcement. If, however, there is no earnings announcement in the past six months, then firm i is
excluded from the PEAD portfolio.
To construct the PEAD factor portfolio in month t, we begin with all NYSE, AMEX, and
NASDAQ common stocks with CRSP share codes of 10 or 11, excluding financial firms.

At the

beginning of each month t, we first assign firms to one of two size groups (small “S” or big “B”) based
on whether that firm’s market equity at the end of month t − 1 is below or above the NYSE median
size breakpoint. Each stock is also independently sorted into one of three earnings surprise groups
(low “L”, middle “M”, or high “H”) based on CARi at the end of month t − 1, using 20% and 80%
breakpoints for NYSE firms. Six portfolios (SL, SM, SH, BL, BM, and BH) are formed based on the
intersections of the two groups, and value-weighted portfolio returns are calculated for the current
month. The month t PEAD factor return is then the average return of the high earnings surprise
portfolios (SH and BH) minus the average return of the low earnings surprise portfolios (SL and BL),
that is, P EAD = (rSH + rBH )/2 − (rSL + rBL )/2.
15

If investors underreact to fundamental news by a fixed percentage, then a greater announcement-date return implies
a proportional future alpha. Previous studies of earnings momentum have used return-based surprise measures such
as CARi and earnings-based measures such as the standardized unexpected earnings (SUE) (Chan, Jegadeesh, and
Lakonishok, 1996). Several advantages motivate our choice of a return-based measure. First, an earnings-based measure
of surprise necessarily compares announced earnings to analyst-forecasted earnings or to a time-series historical proxy
for the earnings expectation, either of which is a noisy proxy for the true expected earnings. In addition, the degree
of earnings persistence affects the information content in any given earnings surprise. SUE does not account for this,
whereas a return-based measure does. Moreover, previous literature indicates that return-based measures such as CAR
better forecast future stock returns than do earnings-based measures (see, e.g., Brandt, Kishore, Santa-Clara, and
Venkatachalam, 2008).

1.2

Competing Factor Models
We compare our behavioral factors and the three-factor composite model, which is built on 3

firm characteristics, with traditional factor models, such as the CAPM (Sharpe, 1964; Lintner, 1965;
Black, 1972), models that include the Mkt-Rf, SMB, HML, and MOM factors proposed by Fama and
French (1993) and Carhart (1997), as well as a set of recently proposed factors and models.16 Monthly
factor returns are either downloaded from Kenneth French’s web site or provided by the relevant
authors.17
Novy-Marx (2013, NM4) proposes a four-factor model consisting of a market factor, a value
factor, a momentum factor, and a profitability factor (PMU). The profitability factor is constructed
based on gross profits-to-assets from Compustat annual files. The value, momentum, and profitability
characteristics are demeaned by the average characteristic for firms in the same industry, to hedge the
factor returns for industry exposure. Thus the model is built on 5 characteristics: value, momentum,
gross profits-to-assets, size, and industry. To differentiate from their standard versions, we label the
industry-adjusted value and momentum factors as HML(NM4) and MOM(NM4). All factor portfolios
are annually rebalanced at the end of each June.
Fama and French (2015, FF5) propose a five-factor model built on 4 characteristics. It consists
of a market factor, a size factor, a value factor, an investment factor (CMA), and a profitability factor
(RMW). The investment factor is formed based on annual change in total assets and the profitability
factor based on operating profitability. The size, investment, and profitability factors are formed by a
triple sort on size, change in total assets, and operating profitability. All factor portfolios are annually
rebalanced at the end of each June.
Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015, HXZ4) propose a q-factor model consisting of four factors built on
3 characteristics: a market factor, a size factor, an investment factor (IVA), and a profitability factor
(ROE). The size, investment, and profitability factors are formed by a triple sort on size, change in
total assets from Compustat annual files, and ROE from Compustat quarterly files. To differentiate
from the standard size factor, we label the size factor in this model as SMB(HXZ4). The size and IVA
16
The 3 characteristics of our composite model are external financing, earnings surprises, and size. When firm size is
used in a model to form a factor, as is the case in forming our FIN and PEAD factors and factors in other models, size
is counted as one of the model’s characteristics regardless of whether the model includes a size factor.

factor portfolios are rebalanced annually at the end of each June, and the ROE factor is rebalanced
each month.
The proxy for investment used in the Fama and French (2015) and Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015)
is the annual change in total assets, scaled by the 1-year lagged total assets. Cooper, Gulen, and Ion
(2017) argue that the use of asset growth as a proxy for investment is problematic, in that the use
of an investment factor based on investment measures such as CAPX or PPE growth renders these
factor models far less effective in explaining the cross-section of returns.
Lastly, Stambaugh and Yuan (2017, SY4) propose a four-factor model built on 12 characteristics.
The four factors are a market factor, a size factor, and two mispricing factors (MGMT and PERF).
The MGMT factor is constructed based on 6 characteristics related to investment and financing:
net share issuance, composite issuance, operating accruals, net operating assets, asset growth, and
investment-to-assets. The PERF factor is a composite factor based on 5 characteristics including
price momentum and profitability: distress, O-Score, momentum, gross profitability, and return on
assets. The size factor is formed using only stocks least likely to be mispriced (based on the above
eleven characteristics), to reduce the effect of arbitrage asymmetry. We label it SMB(SY4). The
SMB(SY4), MGMT and PERF factors are rebalanced each month.

1.3

Summary Statistics
Table 1 reports summary statistics for our zero-investment behavioral factor portfolios, and for

a set of factor portfolios proposed in previous literature. Panel A of Table 1 shows that, over our
sample period, FIN offers the highest average premium of 0.80% per month and a monthly Sharpe
ratio of 0.20. The t-statistic testing whether the FIN premium is zero is 4.6, well above the hurdle of
3.0 for new factors proposed by Harvey, Liu, and Zhu (2016). PEAD offers an average premium of
0.65% per month and the highest monthly Sharpe ratio of 0.35. Consistent with this, the t-statistic
testing whether the mean PEAD factor returns is zero is 7.91, the highest among the factors.18
Comparing FIN with investment and profitability factors (e.g., CMA, IVA, PMU, RMW) and
18

The share issuance effect is slightly stronger among large firms, and the PEAD effect much stronger among small
firms. A FIN factor built on large firms, F INB = rBL − rBH , earns an average premium of 0.83% per month, while
FIN built on small firms, F INS = rSL − rSH , earns 0.77% per month. A PEAD factor built on large firms, P EADB =
rBH − rBL , earns an average premium of 0.38% per month, while PEAD built on small firms, P EADS = rSH − rSL ,
earns 0.94% per month. This is consistent with evidence in the literature.

the composite mispricing factor MGMT shows that FIN offers a substantially higher factor premium,
and comparable Sharpe ratio and t-statistic. Comparing PEAD with factors based on short-horizon
characteristics (e.g., MOM, ROE) and the composite mispricing factor PERF, PEAD offers comparable
factor premium but substantially higher Sharpe ratio and t-statistic.19
Panel B reports pairwise correlation coefficients between factor portfolios. We find that different
versions of SMB, HML, and MOM are highly correlated, with correlation coefficients (ρ) greater than
0.90 in most cases. The two investment factors (CMA, IVA) are highly correlated with ρ = 0.90, and
strongly correlated with the value factors (HML, HML(NM4)) with ρ between 0.55 to 0.69. The three
profitability factors (PMU, RMW, ROE) are strongly correlated with each other with ρ around 0.60.
Also, the correlations of ROE with the two momentum factors (MOM, MOM(NM4)) are about 0.5.
Not surprisingly, the composite MGMT factor, constructed on six investment and financing
characteristics, is highly correlated with value factors (HML, HML(NM4)) and investment factors
(CMA, IVA), with ρ ranging from 0.59 to 0.76. The PERF factor, which is constructed on five
characteristics including price momentum and profitability, is highly correlated with both momentum
factors (MOM, MOM(NM4)) and profitability factors (PMU, RMW, ROE), with ρ ranging from 0.48
to 0.72.
Lastly, although FIN is constructed using only external financing, its returns are correlated with
both value factors (HML, HML(NM4)) and investment factors (CMA, IVA), with ρ between 0.50
and 0.66, consistent with issuing firms having both high valuation ratios and substantial investment
levels. FIN is highly correlated with the composite MGMT factor with ρ = 0.80, suggesting that
financing characteristics might be a dominant component in the composition of the MGMT factor.
This suggests that it may not be necessary to use such a large number of characteristics to get a factor
that is effective in explaining the cross-section of expected returns. FIN is moderately correlated with
profitability factors (PMU, RMW, ROE) and the composite PERF factor, with ρ around 0.35. As
we would expect, PEAD is strongly correlated with momentum factors (MOM, MOM(NM4)) and the
19
In Internet Appendix Table A1, we report factor means and t-values for the 1972-1990 and 1991-2014 subperiods,
respectively. Sample sizes are of course smaller in subperiods, reducing t-values. In the earlier subperiod, FIN has a
mean return of 1.12% per month (t = 5.75), and PEAD has a mean of 0.77% per month (t = 7.32). Both point estimates
are extremely large. In the later subperiod, FIN has a mean return of 0.56% per month (t = 2.09), and PEAD has a
mean of 0.55% per month (t = 4.59). Both point estimates are large, though smaller than in the earlier time period. It
is possible that the underlying effects are weakening over time (see McLean and Pontiff (2016)). On the other hand, we
expect subperiod variation by chance.

composite PERF factor, with ρ ranging from 0.38 to 0.48, and moderately correlated with the earnings
profitability factor ROE, with ρ = 0.22. This is consistent with the finding in the literature that
earnings momentum, price momentum, and earnings profitability are correlated, apparently driven
at least in part by market underreaction to latest earnings news (Chan, Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok,
1996). Finally, the correlation between FIN and PEAD is −0.05, suggesting that the two behavioral
factors capture different sources of mispricing.
Panel C summarizes the portfolio weights, returns, and the maximum ex-post Sharpe ratios that
can be achieved by combining various factors to form the tangency portfolio. Rows (1) and (2) show
that combining the Fama-French three factors achieves a maximum monthly Sharpe ratio of 0.22,
and adding the MOM factor increases the Sharpe ratio to 0.31. Rows (3)−(6) show that the optimal
combination of factors from the Fama and French (2015), Novy-Marx (2013), Hou, Xue, and Zhang
(2015), and Stambaugh and Yuan (2017) models achieve realized monthly Sharpe ratios of 0.36, 0.57,
0.43, and 0.50, respectively. In rows (7) and (8), combining two behavioral factors, FIN and PEAD,
achieves a Sharpe ratio of 0.41, while adding the MKT factor increases the Sharpe ratio to 0.52. Thus,
the three-factor composite model earns a Sharpe ratio higher than standard factor models, and all
recently prominent models except for the Novy-Marx (2013) model.
Rows (9)−(12) show that, with the three-factor composite model as a baseline, other recent
prominent factors only marginally increase the Sharpe ratio. For example, adding PMU of the NovyMarx (2013) model or CMA and RMW of the Fama and French (2015) model each increases the
Sharpe ratio from 0.52 to 0.54. Adding IVA and ROE of the Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015) model
increases the Sharpe ratio from 0.52 to 0.55, and adding MGMT and PERF of the Stambaugh and
Yuan (2017) model increases it to 0.56. Finally, rows (13) and (14) show that combining all factors
excluding FIN and PEAD achieves a maximum Sharpe ratio of 0.54. Adding FIN and PEAD results
in a very substantial further increase of the Sharpe ratio to 0.65.

1.4

Comparing Behavioral Factors with Other Factors
When comparing models with traded factors, it is important to compare their ability to price

all returns, that is, both test assets and traded factors (Barillas and Shanken, 2017). Here, using
spanning tests, we assess the power of our behavioral factors to price each of the factors from the

17
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3086063

alternative models, and vice versa. Specifically, we run time-series regressions of the monthly returns
of one factor on other proposed factors and examine the regression intercepts (alphas). If a factor is
subsumed by a set of other factors, we expect the regression alpha to be close to zero.
In interpreting tests between factors, it is important to keep in mind that winning the horse race
is not the only criterion for a good model. It is always possible to construct an overfitted model that
will “beat” all other factors ex post. It is therefore crucial for a model to have a strong combination
of theoretical motivation, parsimony, and good fit.
Table 2 reports the results of regressions of behavioral factor returns on other sets of factor
returns. The significant intercepts from the Fama-French three-factor model, the Carhart model, the
Fama and French (2015) five-factor model and the Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015) q-factor model suggest
that the factors in these models do not explain the FIN premium. However, the profitability-based
model of Novy-Marx (2013) and the four-factor mispricing model of Stambaugh and Yuan (2017) are
able to fully capture the FIN premium. The former model derives its explanatory power from its HML
and PMU factors, and the latter from its MGMT factor. Given the high correlation between MGMT
and FIN (ρ = 0.80, in Panel B of Table 1), it is not surprising that the MGMT factor subsumes
FIN. On the other hand, none of those models fully explain the PEAD premium. The ‘kitchen sink’
regression of the PEAD factor returns on all alternative model factors shows that PEAD continues to
earn a significant alpha of 0.58% per month (t = 6.76), even after controlling for the exposure to all
other proposed factors from the alternative models.
Overall, we confirm that PEAD offers abnormally high returns relative to all the other factors
we examine, including the investment, profitability and mispricing factors of Stambaugh and Yuan
(2017). FIN offers abnormal returns relative to many other factors, except for the profitability factor
PMU of Novy-Marx (2013) and the composite MGMT factor of Stambaugh and Yuan (2017).
Table 3 reports the results of regressions of other factors on our two behavioral factors.20 With
just FIN and PEAD, our two-factor behavioral model fully explains 7 out of the 10 factors we examine,
such as the value factor HML, the momentum factor MOM, the investment and profitability factors
CMA and RMW of Fama and French (2015), the profitability factor ROE of Hou, Xue, and Zhang
(2015), and the MGMT and PERF factors of Stambaugh and Yuan (2017). The exceptions are the
20
Modified versions of SMB, HML, and MOM factors are not examined here, as Table 1 shows that those modified
versions are highly correlated with each other.

size factor SMB, the profitability factor PMU of Novy-Marx (2013), and the investment factor IVA of
Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015). Adding the market factor, our three-factor composite model does not
explain CMA and MGMT factors either, which load negatively on the market factor and therefore
earn significant alphas under the model. However, for the factors other than SMB for which the alphas
remain statistically significant, 48% of the premium earned by these factors is explained by exposure
to the factors in the the BF3 model.21
This significant t-statistic on SMB shows that, at least ex post, the BF3 model could have
been improved by the addition of SMB as a fourth factor. However, while statistically significant, the
economic improvement that would result from adding SMB to the model is small. Specifically, the
Sharpe ratio of the optimal ex-post combination of the three BF3 factors is 0.52 (in Panel C of Table
1). We find that adding a SMB factor to our BF3 model only increases the Sharpe ratio from 0.52 to
0.54.22
Also, if managers time their issuance and repurchase, then our factor model should capture all
long-horizon mispricing without recourse to a size factor. It is important for a factor model to have
a theoretical motivation rather than just an ex-post empirical one. As it turns out, our BF3 model
comes close to pricing all long-horizon anomalies (as shown in Section 2), and additional inclusion of
SMB does not help the model get much closer, as evidenced by the small change in the Sharpe ratio
when we add in an SMB factor.
Overall, we find that FIN and PEAD capture a large fraction of the premia of the factors
from the alternative models, but not vice versa. The evidence suggests that FIN and PEAD contain
important incremental information about average returns relative to existing factors. This motivates
further testing of their ability to explain well-known return anomalies, which we do in the next section.
21

In Internet Appendix Tables A2 and A3, we report spanning regressions for the 1972-1990 and 1991-2014 subperiods,
respectively. The results are generally consistent with those in the whole sample period. In particular, in the later
subperiod, no other factors can explain our PEAD factor. The only models that can explain our FIN factor are NM4,
HXZ4, and SY4. In contrast, our factor model explains all factors from competing models, with three exceptions: SMB,
PMU, and RMW.
22
The improvement in the squared Sharpe ratio is the Treynor-Black squared information ratio, which can also be
calculated using t(α) from the regression of SMB on the BF3 factors in Table 3.

2.1

Explaining Anomaly Returns with Behavioral Factors
Anomaly Magnitudes and Correlations
We next examine whether our composite model explains the various return anomalies

documented in the academic literature. We focus on 34 robust anomalies based upon the list of
anomalies considered in Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015) that earn significant excess returns over their
sample period of 1972 to 2012. We exclude the systematic volatility (Svol) of Ang, Hodrick, Xing,
and Zhang (2006) and the revisions in analysts’ earnings forecasts (6-month holding period, RE-6) of
Chan, Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok (1996) from the set of anomalies considered by Hou, Xue, and
Zhang (2015), as these two portfolios do not earn statistically significant excess returns over our
sample period.

In addition to the remaining HXZ anomalies, we also consider the cash-based

operating profitability (CbOP) of Ball, Gerakos, Linnainmaa, and Nikolaev (2016). Although our
strong inclination is to stick with the HXZ anomalies, to minimize our own discretion, we make an
exception in this case given the evidence in Fama and French (2018) that an anomaly portfolio based
upon cash-based operating profitability dominates one based upon operating profitability.
Since FIN is constructed using a firm’s financing activities, and PEAD using the firm’s quarterly
earnings surprises, we further posit that FIN captures longer-term predictability, and that PEAD
captures short-term underreaction to recent earnings news and the correction to such high-frequency
mispricing. Given that FIN and PEAD are designed to capture mispricing over different horizons,
we are especially interested in how well FIN captures long-horizon anomalies and how well PEAD
captures short-horizon anomalies.
We define as long-horizon those anomalies which continue to earn statistically significant positive
excess returns for 1 to 3 years after portfolio formation. The trading strategies for each of these longhorizon anomaly portfolios are rebalanced annually. In contrast, short-horizon anomalies are those
based upon quarterly accounting reports or high-frequency price information. Such anomalies typically
have a higher decay rate of return predictability as the forecast horizon is extended. The premia earned
by short-horizon anomaly portfolios generally become statistically insignificant after 1 year, and the
trading strategies based on these anomalies are rebalanced monthly.
Based on these criteria, we group the 34 anomalies into 12 short-horizon anomalies, including
20
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3086063

price momentum, earnings momentum, and short-term profitability, and 22 long-horizon anomalies
including long-term profitability, value, investment and financing, and intangibles. Table 4 describes
the list of anomalies under each group, as well as the mean returns and Sharpe ratios of those long/short
anomaly portfolios. Definitions of anomaly characteristics are provided in Appendix A.
To further validate our classification of long- vs. short-horizon anomalies, Table 5 reports the
decay rate of return predictability of each group of anomalies. Short-horizon anomaly portfolios are
formed and rebalanced each month, and long-horizon anomaly portfolios are annually rebalanced.
Using an event time approach, we examine the buy-and-hold returns of the short-horizon anomaly
portfolios in each of the 12 months after portfolio formation. Similarly, for long-horizon anomaly
portfolios, we examine the buy-and-hold returns in each of the 12 quarters post-formation. Panel A
confirms that the premia earned by short-horizon anomaly portfolios become statistically insignificant
after 6 to 9 months. On the other hand, Panel B shows that most long-horizon anomaly portfolios
continue to earn statistically significant abnormal returns for 1 to 3 years after portfolio formation.23
Table 6 presents the pairwise time-series correlations of the anomaly portfolios, grouped by the
anomaly horizon.

Panel A shows that, among short-horizon anomalies, the long/short portfolio

returns of price momentum, earnings momentum, and short-term earnings profitability are strongly
positively correlated, consistent with the literature (Chordia and Shivakumar, 2006; Novy-Marx,
2015a,b). Panel B presents the long-horizon anomaly return correlation matrix. Noticeably, the
long/short portfolio returns of value strategies are positively correlated with that of investment and
financing, but negatively correlated with that of long-term profitability. This is consistent with
existing evidence that growth firms generally issue more equity and invest more heavily.

2.2

Summary of Comparative Model Performance
To examine how well behavioral factors account for various return anomalies, we run anomaly

portfolio regressions of the long/short (L/S) portfolio returns on FIN alone, PEAD alone, a two-factor
model with FIN and PEAD (BF2), and a three-factor risk-and-behavioral composite model with MKT,
FIN, and PEAD (BF3). If a model is efficient, the regression alphas of the L/S portfolios should be
23

There are a few exceptions. For example, GP/A and CbOP do not earn significant abnormal returns using this
event window approach. IvG, IvC, OA, and OC/A earn significant abnormal returns for less than 1 year. Still, we
classify these anomalies as long-horizon, as they are based upon annual accounting reports and it makes more sense to
form annually rebalanced trading strategies based on them.

statistically indistinguishable from zero. We compare the performance of our behavioral-motivated
models with standard factor models, such as the CAPM, the Fama-French three-factor model (FF3),
and the Carhart four-factor model (Carhart4), and recent prominent models, such as the profitabilitybased factor model of Novy-Marx (2013, NM4), the five-factor model of Fama and French (2015, FF5),
the q-factor model of Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015, HXZ4), and the four-factor mispricing model of
Stambaugh and Yuan (2017, SY4).24
Table 7 summarizes the comparative performance of competing factor models in explaining the
set of 34 anomalies. We separately compare model performance on the 12 short-horizon anomalies
(Panel A), the 22 long-horizon anomalies (Panel B), and all 34 anomalies (Panel C). The column
labeled “H-L Ret” reports the monthly average excess return of each L/S anomaly portfolio.25 The
rest of the columns report the regression alphas of each L/S portfolio returns under different factor
models. At the bottom of each panel, we summarize model performance by several statistics: (1)
the number of significant alphas at the 5% level, (2) the average absolute alphas, (3) the average
absolute t-values of alphas, (4) the GRS F -statistics and p-values which test the null hypothesis that
all alphas are jointly zero (Gibbons, Ross, and Shanken, 1989), (5) the Hansen and Jagannathan
(1997, HJ) distance which measures the maximum pricing error generated by a model on a set of
testing portfolios, and (5) the F -statistics and p-values that test whether the average t2 of alphas
under a given model is larger than the average t2 of the composite-model alphas.26
24

In unreported results, we also check the performance of the liquidity factor model of Pastor and Stambaugh (2003),
which adds a traded liquidity factor to the Carhart model. We find that the liquidity factor does not help for explaining
most anomalies.
25
The only anomaly not earning significant excess return is the gross profits-to-assets ratio (GP/A) of Novy-Marx
(2013). Novy-Marx (2013) reports significant high-minus-low GP/A excess returns over the sample period of 1963 to
2010, while our sample period is 1972 to 2014. When restricting to the same period as Novy-Marx (2013), we do find
significant excess returns associated with GP/A. Still, we include GP/A in our analysis because it serves as the underlying
characteristic of the profitability factor (PMU) of the Novy-Marx (2013) model.
26
The HJ-distance is estimated as follows. Consider a portfolio of N assets, with a (gross) return vector Rt at month
t. Let 1N be an N-dimensional vector of ones, and Yt a K-dimensional vector of (gross)
q factor returns including one.

M × (N − K) random variables from χ2 (1) distribution, and then computes the simulated p-value that tests the null
hypothesis that the underlying factor model is specified correctly. We set M = 5000 random draws.

2.2.1

Fitting Short-horizon Anomalies
Panel A of Table 7 compares different models on explaining the list of 12 short-horizon

anomalies. We first look at the number of significant alphas at the 5% level. Among standard factor
models, the CAPM and FF3 models do not capture most of these anomalies and the Carhart4 model
with a momentum factor explains about half of them. Not surprisingly, the FF3 and FF5 models
perform poorly, as these models are designed to price only the longer-horizon anomalies and not
shorter-horizon momentum-like anomalies. The NM4, HXZ4, and SY4 models each miss 2, 1, and 4
anomalies, respectively, owing to the inability of the MOM factor, the ROE factor, and the PERF
factor, respectively, to explain the short-horizon anomaly portfolio returns.

Among our

behaviorally-motivated models, we see that FIN alone captures only a few of these anomalies and
PEAD alone captures all of them. Combining the market factor with FIN and PEAD, our BF3
model fully captures all 12 anomalies. Overall, the evidence suggests that the PEAD factor achieves
great success in capturing abnormal returns associated with price momentum, earnings momentum,
and short-term profitability.
Other statistics confirm the superior performance of the PEAD factor and our BF3 model. The
BF3 model gives the smallest average absolute alpha (|α| = 0.10%) and absolute t (|t| = 0.49%) among
all models. The F -tests suggest that the average of the squared t-statistics for the estimated alphas
(t2 ) under all other models are significantly larger than average t2 of BF3 alphas. Furthermore, the
BF3 model gives the smallest GRS F -statistic and does not reject the null hypothesis that all alphas
are jointly zero (GRS F = 1.15 and p = 0.32). It also gives the smallest HJ-distance and does not
reject the null hypothesis that the composite model is specified correctly (HJ = 14.66 and p = 0.49).
In contrast, all other models give substantially larger average absolute alphas and t, their GRS F -tests
reject the null hypotheses at the 1% level, and the HJ tests reject the null hypotheses that these models
are specified correctly at the 1% level (except for SY4 model which rejects the null at the 10% level).
Although the PERF factor of the SY4 model is constructed on five characteristics related to
price momentum and profitability, our PEAD factor, which is constructed on just two characteristics,
size and earnings surprises, outperforms the composite PERF factor in capturing the 12 short-horizon
anomalies.

2.2.2

Fitting Long-horizon Anomalies
We have argued that our FIN factor should be especially helpful for fitting long-horizon

anomalies, and that a factor model that disentangles long-horizon mispricing with the FIN factor
and short-horizon mispricing with the PEAD factor should help provide a parsimonious fit to
anomalies more generally.27

To test the effectiveness of our factor model, Panel B of Table 7

compares different models on explaining the list of 22 long-horizon anomalies. We first consider the
number of significant alphas at the 5% level. Among standard factor models, the CAPM does not
capture most of these anomalies, the FF3 model gives 12 significant alphas, and the Carhart4 model
gives 8 significant alphas. For competing models, the numbers of significant alphas are 7 (FF5), 3
(NM4), 5 (HXZ4), and 3 (SY4), respectively. Among our behavioral-motivated models, a single FIN
factor gives 6 significant alphas, performing as well as the FF5 and HXZ4 models. A single PEAD
factor does not capture most of these long-horizon anomalies, which is not surprising as PEAD is
designed to capture short-term mispricing. Lastly, our BF3 model (with MKT, FIN, and PEAD)
gives 3 significant alphas, outperforming the FF5 and HXZ4 models and performing equally well as
the NM4 and SY4 models.
Other statistics confirm the good performance of the NM4, BF3, and SY4 models. The SY4
model gives the smallest average absolute alpha (|α| = 0.11%) and absolute t (|t| = 0.70%) among all
models. The F -tests suggest that the average of the squared t-statistics for the estimated alphas (t2 )
under FF5, NM4, and HXZ4 models are not significantly different from average t2 of BF3 alphas, but
the average t2 of SY4 alphas is significantly smaller than that of BF3 alphas. Furthermore, the SY4
model gives the smallest GRS F -statistic and does not reject the null hypothesis that all alphas are
jointly zero (GRS F = 0.74 and p = 0.80). The GRS F -tests only reject the null at a 10% significance
level for NM4 and BF3 models, while rejecting the null at a 1% significance level for all other models
including the FF5 and HXZ4 models. Lastly, the HJ tests cannot reject the null hypotheses that the
FF5, NM4, SY4 and BF3 models are specified correctly, while rejecting the null at 10% significance
level for the HXZ4 model.
27

There is a subtle argument for why the PEAD factor may help capture even long-horizon anomalies to some extent.
Consider a stock that is underpriced based on a long-horizon anomaly characteristic, which implies high expected returns.
If that characteristic is persistent, the stock was on average also underpriced one quarter ago. So the latest earnings
surprise (relative to market expectations) was on average probably positive. So some portion of the high expected return
of the asset is likely to reflect post-earning announcement drift. This suggests that the PEAD factor can, to some extent,
help capture long-horizon anomalies.

24

While the FF5 and HXZ4 models each include an investment factor, both models fail to
explain the average returns of several investment-related anomaly portfolios, such as net operating
assets (NOA), investment-to-asset ratio (IVA), inventory changes (IvC), and operating accruals
(OA). Similarly, the FF5 and HXZ4 models, each with a profitability factor, do not capture the
cash-based operating profitability (CbOP) effect, while our BF3 model does, despite the fact that
neither FIN nor PEAD is directly constructed on investment or profitability characteristics.
The good performance of the SY4 model appears to result from the inclusion of its MGMT
factor, which is constructed on six long-horizon characteristics related to investment and financing,
allowing it to price investment-related anomalies. Interestingly our single long-horizon factor (FIN)
performs almost as well as the MGMT factor in capturing abnormal returns associated with 22 firm
characteristics. This is consistent with the fact that the two factors have a correlation of about 0.8.

2.2.3

Fitting All Anomalies
Panel C of Table 7 summarizes model performance on the 34 anomalies. Our BF3 model gives

just 3 significant alphas at the 5% level, while the FF5, NM4, HXZ4, and SY4 models give 18, 5, 6,
and 7 significant alphas, respectively. The SY4 model gives the smallest, and the BF3 model gives the
second smallest, average absolute alpha and absolute t among all models. The F -tests suggest that the
average of the squared t-statistics for the estimated alphas (t2 ) under NM4 and SY4 models are not
significantly different from average t2 of BF3 alphas, but the average t2 of FF5 and HXZ4 alphas are
significantly larger than that of BF3 alphas at 1% and 10% significance levels, respectively. Unlike in
Panel A and B, the GRS F -tests reject the null hypotheses of all alphas jointly zero under all models,
while the BF3 model achieves the smallest GRS F -statistic. Similarly, the HJ tests reject the null
hypotheses under all models, while the BF3 model gives the smallest HJ-distance measure.28,29
28

In Internet Appendix Table A4, we perform split-sample tests that divides the sample into two roughly equal
subperiods: 1972-1990 and 1991-2014. The conclusion that our 3-factor composite model explains anomalies extremely
well is highly robust. The model explains all 34 anomalies during the earlier subperiod, in sharp contrast with the other
factor models we examine here. In the later subperiod, it explains all of the short-horizon anomalies and all but 4 of the
22 long-horizon anomalies; it has the lowest number of significant alphas except for the SY4 model (which has only 2
significant alphas).
29
In all tests, we use value-weighted test asset portfolios, so microcaps should have relatively little influence. For
robustness, we exclude microcaps (firms with size below the 20th percentile of NYSE firms) from the test assets and
from our factor portfolios. Internet Appendix Table A5 shows that our factor model performs about equally well. As a
further robustness check, we exclude from our factors and the test assets all stocks with prices < $5. Internet Appendix
Table A6 shows that the results are almost unchanged.

Overall, a three-factor risk-and-behavioral composite model (BF3) with a market factor and
two behavioral factors outperforms both traditional factor models and recently prominent models in
explaining the 34 robust anomalies.30 Our findings suggest that many of the existing anomalies, such
as price and earnings momentum, profitability, value, investment and financing, and intangibles, can
be attributed to systematic mispricing.
One criticism of characteristic-based factor models is that the factors are built upon the same
characteristics as the anomalies to be explained. Such models can have high explanatory power for
such anomalies for purely mechanical reasons (Daniel and Titman, 1997). As a robustness check, we
therefore rerun our tests where, for each factor model, we exclude the anomalies whose characteristics
are used to build the factors of that model. The results are very similar to our main results, and the
BF3 model continues to outperform the other models.
Next, we present detailed factor regression results for each anomaly. For brevity, we show
statistics only for the long/short (L/S) hedged anomaly portfolios (not for decile portfolios).
Definitions of anomaly variables and portfolio constructions are described in Appendix A. Table 8
reports alphas and factor loadings from time-series regressions of each L/S anomaly portfolio returns
on recent prominent factor models. We examine factor loadings to gain insights into which factors
contribute to explaining which anomalies.

2.2.4

Earnings and Price Momentum
Our test assets include five earnings momentum portfolios (SUE-1, SUE-6, ABR-1, ABR-6, RE-

1) and three price momentum portfolios (R6-6, R11-1, I-MOM). Panel A of Table 8 shows that, likely
owing to the lack of a momentum factor, the FF5 model does not capture any of these anomalies.
Panel B and C show that the momentum factor (MOM) of the NM4 model and the ROE factor of
the HXZ4 model help fully explain all anomalies, except for the post-earnings announcement drift
(ABR-1). Similarly, Panel D shows that the PERF factor, which is a composite factor formed on five
anomaly variables including price momentum, fully explains many of these anomalies but the post30
Going beyond the Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015) list of anomalies, referees of this paper inquired whether our model
prices the long-term reversal effect of DeBondt and Thaler (1985), the one-month industry momentum effect of Moskowitz
and Grinblatt (1999), and the industry relative reversal effect of Da, Liu, and Schaumburg (2014). We find that our
model fully prices the first two, and that neither our model nor any of the competing models prices the last of these.
So inclusion of these in our main tests would improve the relative performance of our factor model. However, to avoid
cherry-picking, in our overall tests we stick to the Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015) anomalies list.

earnings announcement drift (ABR-1, ABR-6). Lastly, Panel E shows that the PEAD factor fully
captures all anomalies.
Overall, the PEAD factor, constructed on earnings surprises, exhibits stronger pricing power
for price and earnings momentum than does the MOM factor based on past returns, the ROE factor
based on earnings profitability, and the composite PERF factor based on momentum, distress, and
profitability.

2.2.5

Profitability
Our test assets include six profitability anomaly portfolios.

Four are based on short-term

profitability metrics from quarterly COMPUSTAT files or based on earnings realizations (ROAQ,
ROEQ, NEI, FP), and two are based on longer-term profitability metrics from annual COMPUSTAT
files (GP/A, CbOP). The short-term profitability portfolios are rebalanced monthly, and the
long-term profitability portfolios are rebalanced annually.
Panel A of Table 8 shows that despite inclusion of the profitability factor RMW, the FF5 model
fails to fully explain the premia earned by the profitability portfolios; most of these anomalies have
large and significant alphas after controlling for exposure to RMW. Panel B shows that the profitability
(PMU) factor of the NM4 model fully explains all but the failure probability effect (FP). Panel C shows
that the short-term profitability (ROE) factor of the HXZ4 model fully explains all but the cash-based
operating profitability effect (CbOP). Panel D shows that the PERF factor of the SY4 model does not
explain the quarterly ROE effect (ROEQ), earnings surprises measured by the number of consecutive
quarters with earnings increases (NEI), or the cash-based operating profitability effect (CbOP). Lastly,
Panel E shows that the PEAD factor based on earnings surprises fully captures all these profitability
anomalies.
Overall, it is notable that the PEAD factor, constructed on earnings surprises, performs better
in capturing the profitability effects than the profitability factors of the FF5, NM4, and HXZ4 models
and the PERF factor of the SY4 model based on price momentum, distress, and profitability.

2.2.6

Value
Our test assets include five value anomaly portfolios: B/M, E/P, CF/P, NPY, and DUR. Panel A

and B of Table 8 show that the FF5 and NM4 models fully explain all these anomalies, owing to the
inclusion of a value (HML) factor. In Panel C, without a value factor, the investment (IVA) factor of
the HXZ4 model explains all these anomalies except for the net payout yield effect (NPY). In Panel D,
the MGMT factor of the SY4 model, constructed on six anomaly variables related to investment and
financing, fully captures all these anomalies. Lastly, in Panel E, the FIN factor, constructed on external
financing, successfully captures all anomalies as well.

2.2.7

Investment and Financing
Our test assets include nine investment anomaly portfolios (AG, NOA, IVA, IG, IvG, IvC,

OA, POA, PTA) and two financing anomaly portfolios (NSI, CSI). Panel A of Table 8 shows that
the investment (CMA) factor of the FF5 model fails to explain five anomaly portfolios (NOA, IVA,
IvC, OA, NSI). Panel B shows that the NM4 model derives most of its explanatory power from the
value (HML) factor and fully explains all but two anomaly portfolios (IvC and OA). In Panel C, the
investment (IVA) factor of the HXZ4 model explains all but two anomaly portfolios (OA and NSI).
In Panel D, the MGMT factor of the SY4 model explains all but one anomaly portfolio (OA). Lastly,
Panel E shows that our FIN factor captures all but one anomaly portfolio (IvC).
Overall, the value factor (HML) and the investment factors (CMA and IVA) all play a role in
successfully pricing many, but not all, investment and financing anomaly portfolios. The profitability
factors (RMW, PMU, and ROE) to some extent help explain financing anomalies, but go in the wrong
direction for many investment anomalies. Not surprisingly, the MGMT factor, constructed on six
investment and financing return predictors, delivers the best performance. Interestingly, our FIN
factor, constructed on just two return predictors (external financing and firm size), delivers equally
good performance as the composite MGMT factor.

2.2.8

Intangibles
Our test assets include four intangibles anomaly portfolios: OC/A, AD/M, RD/M, and OL.

Panel A of Table 8 shows that the size (SMB) factor of the FF5 model plays a role in successfully
pricing all but one anomaly portfolio (OC/A), which loads negatively on the HML and RMW factors
and earns a significant positive FF5 alpha. In Panel B, the HML factor of the NM4 model explains
all but one anomaly (OC/A), which loads negatively on the PMU factor. Panel C shows that the
SMB factor of the HXZ4 model explains all but one anomaly (RD/M), which loads negatively on the
ROE factor. Panel D shows that, with a modified size factor, the SY4 model captures all but one
anomaly (OC/A), which loads negatively on the MGMT factor. Lastly, Panel E shows that without
a size factor, our BF3 model fails to explain two anomalies (OC/A and RD/M).
The evidence suggests that a size factor contributes greatly to capturing intangibles-related
anomalies, whereas profitability factors and financing factors tend to “explain” some of these
anomalies, such as OC/A and RD/M, in the wrong direction.

Overall, our three-factor

risk-and-behavioral composite model has only a limited ability to explain the set of
intangibles-related anomalies, perhaps partly as a result of the lack of a size factor in the model.

3.1

Forecasting Returns with Behavioral Factor Loadings
Estimation Methods and Results
If FIN and PEAD are behavioral factors that capture return comovement associated with

common mispricing, then loadings on FIN and PEAD will be underpricing proxies. As such, these
loadings should positively predict the cross-section of future stock returns.

We now test this

hypothesis.
We expect mispricing to shift over time, owing to correction of past mispricing and innovations to
mispricing. Correspondingly, we expect substantial instability in firm-level behavioral factor loadings.
This implies substantial error in the estimation of such loadings unless an appropriate conditional
estimation technique is used to address the instability. This problem should be especially severe for
short-term mispricing, which tends to correct more quickly.

29
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3086063

A common presumption for risk factors (such as MKT) in many monthly return tests is that
loadings are persistent over periods of 3 to 5 years. As such, when estimating risk factor loadings, the
standard method has been to run rolling window regressions over the previous 60 months.31 However,
for our behavioral factors, this presumption is unlikely to apply. Though a firm characteristic (upon
which the behavioral factor is constructed) can be indefinitely mispriced by the market, no particular
firm is likely to stay over- or underpriced forever, and therefore individual firm loadings on behavioral
factors, especially short-horizon factors, should not be stable over longer horizons. We therefore
estimate firms’ loadings on behavioral factors using daily excess returns over a one-month horizon.32
Specifically, estimated firm factor loadings at the start of month t come from regressions of each
firm’s daily (excess) returns on daily (excess) market, FIN, and PEAD factor returns over month
t − 1 (a minimum of 15 valid daily returns is required). The estimated coefficients on FIN and PEAD
(βF IN and βP EAD ) at the end of month t − 1 are then used to forecast firm-level stock returns in
month t in a Fama and MacBeth (1973) regression, with standard control variables and a broad set
of firm characteristics underlying the list of 34 robust anomalies that we examine. Standard controls
include log(ME), log(B/M), and the previous one-month, one-year, and three-year returns to control
for short-run contrarian, momentum, and long-term reversal, respectively. All regressors are winsorized
at top and bottom 1% and standardized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation, to make the
coefficients comparable.
Table 9 reports the regression results. Models (1) and (2) show that estimated firm βF IN loadings
positively and significantly forecast the following month’s stock returns, with or without standard
controls. In models (3)−(9), we add one by one earnings momentum and short-term profitability
characteristics, and in model (10), we run a horse race between βF IN and all these characteristics,
we find that the coefficients on βF IN remain positive and statistically significant in all tests. This
suggesting that the return predictive ability of βF IN is incremental to these short-horizon anomaly
characteristics.
In models (11)−(13), we include two financing characteristics used to construct FIN. We find
31

However, some recent papers have utilitized daily data over different horizons for estimating the correlation and
volatility components of firm loadings. See, e.g., Frazzini and Pedersen (2014).
32
The daily FIN and PEAD factor construction is identical to the construction of the corresponding monthly factors:
each (value-weighted) component portfolio is rebalanced each year at June month end for FIN, and at the end of each
month for PEAD.

that the coefficient on βF IN remains statistically significant when controlling for net share issuance
(NSI), but is only marginally significant after controlling for composite share issuance (CSI). When
including both NSI and CSI, βF IN becomes significant again. In models (14)−(22) we add, one by
one, a number of investment characteristics, and in model (23) we run a horse race between βF IN
and all these characteristics. The coefficients on βF IN remain highly significant in all regressions. In
model (24), when controlling for all financing and investment characteristics, the coefficient on βF IN
becomes marginally significant, primarily driven by the strong predictive power of composite share
issuance (CSI). The evidence suggests that the return predictive ability of βF IN is incremental to both
investment and financing characteristics.
In models (25)−(38), we control for characteristics related to profitability, value, and intangibles.
Consistent with earlier evidence, the return predictive ability of βF IN stays robust and incremental
to profitability and value characteristics. When controlling for intangibles, the coefficients on βF IN
become weaker or statistically insignificant. This is consistent with the evidence in Tables 7 and 8
indicating that our behavioral factors exhibit weak pricing power for the intangibles-related anomalies,
in particular R&D.
Overall, our findings suggest that estimated firm loadings on FIN positively and significantly
forecast future stock returns. This predictive power is robust to controlling for many well-known
return predictors in the literature. The evidence supports our hypothesis that FIN captures return
comovement resulting from common mispricing.
While the predictive power of βF IN for future returns is statistically strong, the coefficients on
βP EAD are statistically insignificant in all models. A likely explanation is that the PEAD loadings,
βP EAD , are estimated with substantial noise owing to the fact that these are estimates of a transient
source of mispricing. PEAD is built on cumulative abnormal returns during the four-day window
around earnings announcement (CAR as defined above, or ABR-1 as defined in Table 4). Table 5
shows that the return predictive ability of ABR portfolios becomes much weaker or insignificant just
two quarters after portfolio formation.33
33

The correlation between PEAD characteristic (CAR) and estimated PEAD beta is very low−below 0.05. This
suggests that the PEAD-beta estimates are too noisy to predict the cross-section of stock returns. Regressions by
calendar month show that PEAD betas do not predict stock returns in most months (apart from May and September).

3.2

Discussion
These cross-sectional tests generally confirm the predictive power of FIN factor loadings for

future returns, but not PEAD factor loadings. However, for several reasons, we place less weight on
the cross-sectional tests than the time-series tests, particularly for the higher-frequency PEAD factor.
First, each month, the cross-sectional regression (Fama and MacBeth, 1973) coefficient is the return of
a zero-investment portfolio (weighted by the corresponding regressor) in that month. These portfolios
can have large weights on microcap stocks which are costly to trade, and for which microstructure
noise can bias coefficient estimates. Second, since factor loadings are estimated with noise, there is
an errors-in-variables bias in the coefficients. As discussed earlier, such bias is likely to be especially
severe for the loadings on short-horizon behavioral factors. We discuss each of these points in turn.
The intuition for the bias in the Fama-MacBeth coefficient estimates is as follows. In a setting
like ours where the characteristics (regressors) are relatively stable, the regression coefficient portfolio
will implicitly place relatively constant weight on securities from month to month, much like an
equal-weighted portfolio. Maintaining this approximate constant-weighting requires rebalancing the
portfolio each month, buying firms that have fallen in value and selling firms that have risen. Thus
any microstructure noise (or bid-ask bounce) that results in negative serial correlation in measured
returns will result in strong positive average returns for such portfolios as a result of this rebalancing.
However, these returns are not achievable, as even small transaction costs will tremendously reduce the
actual returns from such a strategy, especially for portfolios tilted towards small and illiquid firms.34
In adddition, as noted above, the PEAD factor loadings are proxies for transient mispricing and
are therefore estimated with substantial noise. The resulting errors-in-variables problem will reduce
the ability of these loadings to subsume the effect of characteristics in predicting returns.
Overall, the results for FIN loadings confirm our hypothesis that loadings on behavioral factors
are underpricing proxies.

The lack of a finding for PEAD loadings is neither confirmation nor

disconfirmation, since the theory suggests that such loadings are likely to be unstable and hard to
estimate. Indeed, most papers that introduce new factor models do not perform Fama-Macbeth
regressions, in part because of the errors-in-variables estimation challenges of such tests. Since the
34

Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2017) also discuss the biases inherent in the cross-sectional regression method. See their
discussion on p. 12.

errors-in-variables problem in cross-sectional regressions severely biases in favor of null findings, it is
notable that these tests do work for our FIN loadings.

4

Effects of Limits to Arbitrage
We next conduct additional tests of the effects of limits to arbitrage to refine our understanding

of where FIN and PEAD are most effective. We focus on market frictions, which affect arbitrageurs’
ability to exploit mispricing. Owing to limits to arbitrage and short-sale constraints, we expect that
behavioral factors are especially good at explaining returns of stocks with high arbitrage frictions,
such as stocks in the short-leg portfolios and stocks with greater market frictions.

4.1

The Loadings on Behavioral Factors of Long- and Short-leg Portfolios
To exploit anomaly profits, it is standard to form a zero-investment portfolio by going long

underpriced stocks and short overpriced stocks. Owing to short-sale constraints, overpriced stocks
in the short-leg portfolios are harder to correct and therefore more subject to mispricing. If FIN
and PEAD capture mispricing, they should explain the returns of the short-leg portfolios particularly
well. Generally, we expect the long-leg portfolios (underpriced) to load positively on FIN and PEAD
and the short-leg portfolios (overpriced) to load negatively. If FIN and PEAD explain the short legs
particularly well, we would expect the negative loadings of the short legs to be larger in absolute
magnitude than the positive loadings of the long legs. Moreover, since PEAD primarily captures
high-frequency mispricing and FIN captures low-frequency mispricing, we expect the result for PEAD
loadings to be more pronounced among short-horizon anomalies and the result for FIN loadings more
pronounced among long-horizon anomalies.
We run time-series regressions of the long- and short-leg portfolio returns on our composite
model. We count how many short-horizon anomalies have more negative (larger in absolute magnitude)
PEAD loadings in the short legs than the positive loadings in the long legs, and we highlight these cases
in boldface. Similarly for long-horizon anomalies, we highlight the cases where the negative loadings
on the FIN factor in the short legs are larger (in absolute magnitude) than the positive loadings in
the long legs. Table 10 reports the results. Panel A shows that for the 12 short-horizon anomalies, 11

anomalies have larger negative and statistically significant βP EAD in the short legs. In contrast, only
1 anomaly has larger positive and statistically significant βP EAD in the long legs. The average βP EAD
is −0.51 for the short legs and 0.31 for the long legs. The evidence is consistent with our hypothesis
that PEAD primarily captures high-frequency mispricing embedded in short-horizon anomalies and
explains the returns of the short-leg portfolios particularly well.
Similarly, Panel B shows that for the 22 long-horizon anomalies, 15 anomalies have larger
negative and statistically significant βF IN in the short legs. In contrast, just 3 anomalies have larger
positive and statistically significant βF IN in the long legs. The average βF IN is −0.27 for the short
legs and 0.03 for the long legs.

Again, the evidence confirms that FIN primarily captures

low-frequency mispricing embedded in long-horizon anomalies and explains the returns of the
short-leg portfolios particularly well. Overall, the findings support the idea that FIN and PEAD
capture commonality in mispricing.

4.2

Market Frictions and the Beta-Return Relation
We have hypothesized that firm loadings or betas on FIN and PEAD are proxies for the degree

of mispricing, implying a positive relation between FIN or PEAD betas and future stock returns. In
Section 3, we confirmed the strong return predictive ability of FIN betas, but found that PEAD betas
have no statistically significant power to forecast future returns, potentially as a result of estimation
issues involving betas on transient mispricing among small illiquid firms.
In this section, we further propose that market frictions impede arbitrage in mispricing, and
thereby affect the sensitivity of the FIN-beta/return relation. Owing to limits to arbitrage and shortsale constraints, we expect high-friction stocks to have greater mispricing. Mispricing, as proxied by
factor betas on FIN, is measured with noise. For stocks with low frictions and low mispricing (either
over- or underpricing), most of the variation in the mispricing proxies (factor betas) would be noise.
For such stocks, we should observe low sensitivity of expected returns to estimated factor betas. In
contrast, for stocks with large frictions and thus greater potential under- or overpricing, we expect less
noise in the mispricing proxies and therefore high sensitivity of expected returns to estimated factor
betas. Therefore, we hypothesize that the FIN-beta/return relation should be stronger for high-friction
stocks.

34

We first test this hypothesis using two-way portfolio sorts on friction proxies and factor betas.
Specifically, at the beginning of each month, we rank firms into 25 portfolios by independent sorts on
their FIN betas (from Section 3) and market friction proxies. Portfolios are held for the current month
and rebalanced at the beginning of the next month. We calculate value-weighted returns for each
portfolio, and corresponding Newey and West (1987) corrected t-statistics. Following the literature,
we use three friction proxies: the illiquidity measure (ILLIQ) of Amihud (2002), the institutional
ownership defined as shares held by institutions divided by shares outstanding (IO), and the residual
institutional ownership (RIO) of Nagel (2005), controlling for size. Firms with larger ILLIQ, or smaller
IO and RIO, have greater market frictions. Consistent with our hypothesis, Panel A of Table 11 shows
that, using ILLIQ and IO as friction proxies, the FIN-beta/return relation is positive and statistically
significant only for high-friction stocks. The results using RIO are consistent with our hypothesis but
statistically insignificant.
Next, we run Fama and MacBeth (1973) cross-sectional regressions of monthly stock returns on
firms’ βF IN , the quintile ranks of their market friction proxies, and the interactions between βF IN
and friction ranks, controlling for standard return predictors. All regressors are winsorized at top and
bottom 1% and standardized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation, to make the coefficients
comparable. Panel B of Table 11 shows the results. We are particularly interested in the interaction
terms. The coefficients on the interaction between βF IN and ILLIQ ranks are statistically insignificant.
On the other hand, the coefficients on the interactions between βF IN and IO or RIO ranks are both
negative and statistically significant, suggesting that high-friction stocks (in low IO or RIO ranks)
have greater beta-return sensitivity.
Overall, the evidence from portfolio sorts and cross-sectional regressions is largely consistent
with our hypothesis that the sensitivity of FIN-beta/return relation is stronger among stocks with
higher arbitrage frictions, indicating that FIN betas capture mispricing.

Conclusion
We supplement the market factor of the CAPM with behavioral factors intended to capture

commonality in mispricing associated with psychological biases. We focus on two psychological biases

35
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3086063

that are likely to affect asset prices: overconfidence and limited attention. Motivated by the idea
that investor overconfidence induces commonality in longer-horizon mispricing, and that managers
time share issuance and repurchase to exploit this mispricing (Stein, 1996; Daniel, Hirshleifer, and
Subrahmanyam, 1998, 2001), we create a financing factor (FIN) based on external financing. Motivated
by the theory that limited investor attention induces stock market underreaction to public news arrival,
we consider a post-earnings announcement drift factor (PEAD) constructed based upon earnings
surprises. We further hypothesize that FIN especially reflects the returns associated with long-term
(> 1 year) mispricing, and that PEAD especially reflects returns associated with shorter-term (< 1
year) mispricing.
Our new factor model is designed to capture these complementary aspects of mispricing. We
test the ability of our three-factor risk-and-behavioral composite model to explain well-known return
anomalies.

This composite approach is suggested by theoretical models in which both risk and

misvaluation proxies predict returns.

We find that the FIN factor is dominant in explaining

long-horizon return anomalies, and the PEAD factor is dominant for short-horizon anomalies.
We compare the model performance with standard factor models and recently prominent models,
such as the profitability-based model of Novy-Marx (2013), the five-factor model of Fama and French
(2015), the q-factor model of Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015), and the mispricing model of Stambaugh
and Yuan (2017). Our composite model outperforms all other models in explaining the returns of
34 anomaly portfolios, based on the list of anomalies considered in Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015). In
addition to its simple conceptual motivation, the composite model is parsimonious in the sense that,
along with the market, two behavioral factors built upon only three economic characteristics−size,
financing, and earnings surprise−capture a wide range of anomalies.
If FIN and PEAD are indeed priced behavioral factors that capture commonality in mispricing,
then behavioral models imply that firm loadings on FIN should be proxies for persistent underpricing,
and loadings on PEAD should be proxies for transient underpricing. In consequence, these loadings
should positively predict the cross-section of stock returns. Using Fama-MacBeth cross-sectional
regressions, we confirm that estimated FIN loadings strongly forecast future returns. Notably, this
predictive power remains robust even after controlling for most of the 34 anomaly characteristics that
we examine. In contrast, estimated PEAD loadings have no return predictive ability. It is not clear

36

how to interpret the PEAD finding, since there are econometric issues associated with the instability
of the PEAD loadings as proxies for transient mispricing and the heavy influence of small illiquid firms
on Fama-MacBeth regression tests.
Finally, we conduct several tests related to limits to arbitrage and provide additional evidence
suggesting that FIN and PEAD indeed capture mispricing effects. If these are behavioral factors, we
expect the mispricing that they identify to be stronger when limits to arbitrage, including short-sale
constraints, are more binding. We find that FIN and PEAD are particularly useful for predicting
the returns of stocks with high arbitrage frictions, such as over- rather than under-priced stocks, and
stocks with greater trading frictions.
Our paper contributes to a large literature on factor pricing models and anomalies. It is a
mathematical fact that a one-factor model always exists that perfectly explains average returns, ex
post. But without theoretical motivation, such a model represents meaningless overfitting. The factor
model we offer has an attractive behavioral motivation, and also a better fit than existing factor models.
So our conceptual contribution here is not in devising novel factors. It is to suggest that based on
theoretical considerations, behavioral effects should be captured well by two behavioral factors that
reflect short- and long-horizon mispricing; and that when these are combined with the market factor
(to capture rational risk premia), the resulting factor model should capture the cross-section of stock
returns very effectively. Our empirical contribution is to show that this is indeed the case.
Our paper also partially addresses the prevalent data-mining concern in the anomaly literature.
McLean and Pontiff (2016), Harvey, Liu, and Zhu (2016), and Linnainmaa and Roberts (2018) each
argue that some fraction of the return premia associated with various anomalies is a result of overfitting
rather than actual mispricing. In contrast, Lu, Stambaugh, and Yuan (2017) show that anomalies
previously identified in U.S. cross-sectional equity data are also significant in five non-U.S. markets,
suggesting that the characteristics underlying these anomalies robustly identify mispricing.
The facts that our model fits very well and that the two behavioral factors contribute heavily
to fitting many well-known anomalies suggest that many important anomalies are about mispricing.
Furthermore, if anomalies can be explained by just a few economically-motivated factors, it suggests
to us that they are far from wholly spurious. In particular, the strong performance of our financing
factor in explaining anomalies suggests that corporate managers are issuing and repurchasing to exploit

many of the well-known anomalies. This also suggests that these effects have some basis in reality.

Table 1: Summary Statistics of Factor Portfolios
Panel A reports the mean and standard deviations of monthly factor returns for a set of traded factors. In addition, we report the t-statistic testing whether the
mean return is different from zero, the corresponding monthly Sharpe ratio, and the sample period for each return factor. Panel B reports Pearson correlations
between factor portfolio returns, and Panel C reports summary statistics for the ex post tangency portfolios of various factor-portfolio combinations. These factors
include the Mkt-Rf, SMB, HML, MOM factors proposed by Fama and French (1993) and Carhart (1997), and modified versions of these factors proposed by
Novy-Marx (2013, NM4), Fama and French (2015, FF5), Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015, HXZ4), and Stambaugh and Yuan (2017, SY4). In addition we include: the
investment factors CMA and IVA of Fama and French (2015) and Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015), the profitability factors PMU, RMW, and ROE of Novy-Marx
(2013), Fama and French (2015), and Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015), and the two mispricing factors MGMT and PERF of Stambaugh and Yuan (2017). Monthly
factor returns are either from Kenneth French’s web page or provided by corresponding authors. FIN and PEAD are our behavioral factors. FIN is the
financing-based misvaluation factor constructed based upon two financing characteristics, net share issuance and composite issuance. PEAD is the post-earnings
announcement drift factor, constructed based upon earnings surprises (measured as the four-day cumulative abnormal returns around quarterly earnings
announcements). In Panel C, we add asterisk after factors SMB, HML and MOM, meaning these factors have modified versions, and asterisk after models NM4,
FF5, HXZ4 and SY4, meaning these models use modified factors.

Table 2: Factor Regressions of Behavioral Factors on Other Factors
This table reports the results of time-series regressions of behavioral factors on the sets of factors incorporated in other factor models: (1) the Fama-French
three-factor model (FF3), (2) the Carhart four-factor model (Carhart4), (3) the profitability-based model of Novy-Marx (2013, NM4), (4) the five-factor model of
Fama and French (2015, FF5), (5) the q-factor model of Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015, HXZ4), (6) the four-factor mispricing model of Stambaugh and Yuan (2017,
SY4), and (7) the “kitchen sink” model with all factors. The asterisk after factors SMB, HML and MOM means that these factors have modified versions and the
asterisk after models NM4, FF5, HXZ4 and SY4 means these models use modified factors. The sample period is from 1972:07 to 2014:12, depending on data
availability. Newey-West corrected t-statistics (with 6 lags) are shown in parentheses.

This table reports the list of anomalies considered in the paper, closely matching the set of robust anomalies (with significant abnormal returns) considered in Hou,
Xue, and Zhang (2015). We classify the total 34 anomalies into two groups: 12 short-horizon anomalies and 22 long-horizon anomalies. Short-horizon anomalies
include earning momentum, price momentum, and short-term profitability. Long-horizon anomalies include long-horizon profitability, value, investment and
financing, and intangibles. The last two columns report the monthly mean returns (in percent) of the long/short anomaly portfolios and the Sharpe ratios. The
sample period runs from 1972:07 to 2014:12, depending on data availability.

Table 5: Decay Rate of Anomaly Portfolio Returns
This table reports the decay rate of various anomaly portfolio returns. Short-horizon anomaly portfolios are formed and rebalanced each month. Using an event
time approach, we calculate the value-weighted buy-and-hold portfolio returns in each of the 12 months, and in each of the 4 quarters, after portfolio formation
(weighted by firm size in the ranking month). Long-horizon anomaly portfolios are formed and rebalanced each June. We calculate value-weighted buy-and-hold
portfolio returns in each of the 12 quarters, and in each of the 3 years, after portfolio formation (weighted by firm size in the ranking month). Panel A reports the
average long/short portfolio returns of short-horizon anomalies over each return window, and Panel B for long-horizon anomalies, with Newey-West corrected
t-statistics (6 lags for monthly or quarterly window, 12 lags for annual window). When a long/short portfolio earns significant returns in predicted direction over a
return window, we highlight this case in boldface. The sample period runs from 1972:07 to 2014:12, depending on data availability.

Table 6: Correlations Between Anomaly Portfolios
This table reports pairwise correlation coefficients between returns of the long/short hedged anomaly portfolios. The signs of L/S portfolios are converted, when
necessary, to ensure that the L/S portfolio returns reflect the actual (positive) arbitrage profits. Panel A reports correlations among 12 short-horizon anomalies, and
Panel B reports correlations among 22 long-horizon anomalies. Correlation coefficients greater than 0.30 are highlighted in bold. The sample period runs from
1972:07 to 2014:12, depending on data availability.

Table 7: Comparative Model Performance
This table reports comparative performance of different factor models in explaining anomalies. We compare three sets of factor models. The first set includes
standard factor models: the CAPM, Fama-French three-factor model (FF3), and Carhart four-factor model (Carhart4). The second set includes four recent models:
the five-factor model of Fama and French (2015, FF5), the profitability-based model of Novy-Marx (2013, NM4), the q-factor model of Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015,
HXZ4), and the four-factor mispricing model of Stambaugh and Yuan (2017, SY4). The last set includes our behavioral-motivated models: a single factor FIN, a
single factor PEAD, a two-factor model with FIN and PEAD (BF2), and a three-factor risk-and-behavioral composite model with MKT, FIN, and PEAD (BF3).
The table reports the regression alphas from time-series regressions of long/short anomaly portfolio returns on each factor model, with Newey-West corrected
t-statistics (6 lags). Panel A compares model performance for short-horizon anomalies, Panel B for long-horizon anomalies, and Panel C for all anomalies. As
comparative statistics, we summarize the number of significant alphas at 5% level, the average absolute alphas and t-values, the F -statistics and p-values that test
whether the average t2 of alphas under a given model is significantly larger than the average t2 of the composite-model alphas, the GRS F -statistics and p-values
following Gibbons, Ross, and Shanken (1989), and the HJ-distance following Hansen and Jagannathan (1997). The sample period runs from 1972:07 to 2014:12,
depending on data availability.

Table 8: Factor Regressions of Long/Short Anomaly Portfolios
This table reports alphas and factor betas from time-series regressions of long/short anomaly portfolio returns on recent prominent factor models. Panel A, B, C, D
report regression alphas and factor betas under the five-factor model of Fama and French (2015), the profitability-based factor model of Novy-Marx (2013), the
q-factor model of Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015), and the four-factor mispricing model of Stambaugh and Yuan (2017), respectively. Panel E reports the alphas and
betas under our three-factor risk-and-behavioral composite model (BF3). Newey-West corrected t-statistics (with 6 lags) are shown in parentheses. The sample
period runs from 1972:07 to 2014:12, depending on data availability.

Table 9: Firm-Level Fama-MacBeth Regressions on Behavioral Factor Loadings
This table reports firm-level Fama-MacBeth regressions of monthly stock returns on factor loadings of FIN and PEAD, while controlling for standard return
predictors and firm characteristics. βF IN and βP EAD are estimated by monthly rolling regressions of daily stock returns in the previous month on the three-factor
composite model (BF3), which includes a daily market factor, a daily FIN factor, and a daily PEAD factor, with a minimum of 15 daily returns required. Standard
return predictors include log(ME) at the end of the previous month, log(B/M) as of the previous fiscal year end, past 1-month return, past 1-year return from
month t − 12 to t − 2, and past 3-year return from month t − 36 to t − 13. All past returns are on monthly basis. Firm characteristics include all short-horizon and
long-horizon anomaly characteristics described in Table 4. Intercepts are included in all regressions but not reported here. All regressors are winsorized at top and
bottom 1% and standardized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation. Newey-West corrected t-statistics are reported in parentheses (with 6 lags). The
sample period runs from 1972:08 to 2014:12 (507 months), depending on data availability.

Table 10: Behavioral Factor Loadings of the Long- and Short-Leg Portfolios
This table reports time-series regressions of the long- and short-leg portfolio returns on the three-factor composite
model. Panel A shows PEAD factor betas of the long- and short-leg portfolios for each of the 12 short-horizon
anomalies, and Panel B shows FIN factor betas for long-horizon anomalies. At the bottom of each panel, we summarize
the average FIN or PEAD betas, and count how many anomalies have larger (in absolute terms) and significant FIN or
PEAD betas in the short legs than in the long legs (highlighted in boldface), and vice versa. The sample period runs
from 1972:07 to 2014:12, depending on data availability.

Table 11: Market Frictions and Sensitivity of Beta-Return Relation
Panel A reports returns of double-sorted portfolios by market frictions and FIN factor loadings (βF IN ). At the
beginning of each month, firms are ranked into 25 portfolios by independent sorts on βF IN and market friction proxies
(estimated in the previous month). Value-weighted portfolio returns are calculated for the current month and portfolios
are rebalanced at the beginning of the next month. Panel B reports results of Fama-MacBeth cross-sectional regression
of monthly stock returns on βF IN , the quintile ranks of market friction proxies, and the interactions between βF IN and
friction ranks, with standard control variables. Newey-West corrected t-statistics are shown in the parentheses (with 3
lags). We use three friction proxies: the illiquidity measure (ILLIQ) of Amihud (2002), the institutional ownership
defined as shares held by institutions divided by shares outstanding (IO), and the residual institutional ownership
(RIO) of Nagel (2005) controlling for size. All regressors are winsorized at top and bottom 1% and standardized to
have zero mean and unit standard deviation, to make the coefficients comparable.The sample period runs from 1972:08
to 2014:12 (507 months) using ILLIQ, and from 1980:02 to 2014:12 (417 months) using IO and RIO.

Appendix
A
A.1

Definition of Anomaly Variables
Short-horizon anomalies

Standardized unexpected earnings (SUE-1, SUE-6):
Following Foster, Olsen, and Shevlin (1984), SUE is calculated as the change in quarterly earnings per share (Compustat
quarterly item EPSPXQ) from its value four quarters ago divided by the standard deviation of this change over the prior
eight quarters (six quarters minimum). To align quarterly SUE with monthly CRSP stock returns, SUE is used in the
months immediately following the quarterly earnings announcement date (Compustat quarterly item RDQ) but within
6 months from the fiscal quarter end, to exclude stale earnings. To exclude recording errors, we also require the earnings
announcement date to be after the corresponding fiscal quarter end.
At the beginning of each month t, we rank all NYSE, Amex, and NASDAQ stocks into deciles based on their lagged
SUE in month t − 1. Monthly portfolio returns are calculated separately for the current month t (SUE-1) and for the
subsequent six months from t to t + 5 (SUE-6). The portfolios are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. For SUE-6
portfolios, we calculated the monthly portfolio returns following Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015). Because of the six-month
holding period, in each month, a given SUE-6 decile has six sub-deciles that are initiated in the prior six-month period.
We then take the simple average of the six sub-deciles returns as the monthly return of each SUE-6 decile.
Cumulative abnormal return around earnings announcements (ABR-1, ABR-6):
Following Chan, Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok (1996), ABR is calculated as the four-day cumulative abnormal returns
(t − 2, t + 1) around the latest quarterly earnings announcement date (Compustat quarterly item RDQ):
CARi =

d=1
X

(Ri,d − Rm,d )

d=−2

where Rid is stock i’s return on day d and Rmd is the market return on day d. To align quarterly ABR with monthly CRSP
stock returns, ABR is used in the months immediately following the quarterly earnings announcement date (Compustat
quarterly item RDQ) but within 6 months from the fiscal quarter end, to exclude stale earnings. To exclude recording
errors, we also require the earnings announcement date to be after the corresponding fiscal quarter end.
At the beginning of each month t, we rank all NYSE, Amex, and NASDAQ stocks into deciles based on their lagged
ABR in month t − 1. Monthly portfolio returns are calculated separately for the current month t (ABR-1) and for the
subsequent six months from t to t+5 (ABR-6). The portfolios are rebalanced at the beginning of month t+1. For ABR-6
portfolios, we calculated the monthly portfolio returns following Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015). Because of the six-month
holding period, in each month, a given ABR-6 decile has six sub-deciles that are initiated in the prior six-month period.
We then take the simple average of the six sub-deciles returns as the monthly return of each ABR-6 decile.
Revisions in analysts’ earnings forecasts (RE-1):
Analysts’ earnings forecast data are from the Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System (IBES). Following Chan, Jegadeesh,
and Lakonishok (1996), RE is calculated as the six-month moving average of past changes in analysts’ forecasts:
REit =

6
X
fit−j − fit−j−1
pit−j−1
j=1

where fit−j is the consensus mean forecast (IBES unadjusted file, item MEANEST) issued in month t − j for firm i’s
current fiscal year earnings (IBES unadjusted file, item FPI (fiscal period indicator) =1), and pit−j−1 is the prior month’s
share price (IBES unadjusted file, item PRICE). A minimum of four monthly forecast changes is required.
At the beginning of month t, we rank all NYSE, Amex, and NASDAQ stocks into deciles based on their lagged RE in
month t − 1. Monthly portfolio returns are calculated for the current month t (RE-1) and the portfolios are rebalanced
at the beginning of month t + 1.

Price momentum (R6-6, R11-1):
Following Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), R6 is calculated as a stock’s prior 6-month average returns from month t − 7
to t − 2. At the beginning of each month t, we rank all stocks into deciles based on R6 and calculate monthly decile
returns from month t to t + 5 (R6-6), skipping month t − 1. The deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1.
Because of the six-month holding period, in each month, a given R6-6 decile has six sub-deciles that are initiated in the
prior six-month period. Following Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015), we take the simple average of the six sub-deciles returns
as the monthly return of each R6-6 decile.
The R11-1 deciles are constructed similarly. Following Fama and French (1996), R11 is calculated as a stock’s prior
11-month average returns from month t − 12 to t − 2. At the beginning of each month t, we rank all stocks into deciles
based on R11 and calculate monthly decile returns for month t (R11-1), skipping month t − 1. The deciles are rebalanced
at the beginning of month t + 1.
Industry momentum (I-MOM):
We start with the Fama-French 49-industry classification. We exclude financial firms, which leaves 45 industries. For
each industry, we calculate its prior six-month return from month t − 6 to t − 1, by taking a weighted-average of all stocks
returns within the industry. Following Moskowitz and Grinblatt (1999), we do not skip month t − 1 when measuring
industry momentum.
At the beginning of each month t, we rank the 45 industries into 9 I-MOM portfolios (each with 5 industries) based on
their prior six-month returns from month t − 6 to t − 1. Monthly portfolio returns are calculated for the subsequent six
months from t to t + 5, by taking the simple average of the 5 industry returns within each portfolio, and the portfolios
are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. Because of the six-month holding period, in each month, a given I-MOM
portfolio has six sub-portfolios that are initiated in the prior six-month period. Following Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015),
we take the simple average of the six sub-portfolios returns as the monthly return of each I-MOM portfolio.
Quarterly ROE and ROA (ROEQ, ROAQ):
ROEQ and ROAQ are calculated using Compustat quarterly files. ROEQ is income before extraordinary items (IBQ)
divided by one-quarter lagged book equity. ROAQ is income before extraordinary items (IBQ) divided by one-quarter
lagged total assets (ATQ). Book equity is shareholders’ equity, plus deferred taxes and investment tax credit (TXDITCQ),
minus book value of preferred stocks. Shareholders’ equity is shareholders’ equity (SEQQ), or common equity (CEQQ)
plus the carrying value of preferred stocks(PSTKQ), or total assets (ATQ) minus total liabilities (LTQ), depending on
data availability. Book value of preferred stocks equal the redemption value (PSTKRQ) if available, or the carrying value
of preferred stocks(PSTKQ).
To align quarterly ROEQ and ROAQ with monthly CRSP stock returns, ROEQ and ROAQ are used in the months
immediately following the quarterly earnings announcement date (RDQ) but within 6 months from the fiscal quarter
end, to exclude stale earnings. To exclude recording errors, we also require the earnings announcement date to be after
the corresponding fiscal quarter end.
At the beginning of each month t, we rank all stocks into deciles based on their lagged ROEQ or ROAQ in month t − 1.
We calculate value-weighted decile returns for month t and rebalance the deciles at the beginning of month t + 1.
Number of consecutive quarters with earnings increases (NEI):
Following Barth, Elliott, and Finn (1999) and Green, Hand, and Zhang (2013), we measure NEI as the number of
consecutive quarters (up to eight quarters) with an increase in earnings (Compustat quarterly item IBQ) over the same
quarter in the prior year. NEI takes values from 0 to 8 quarters. To align quarterly NEI with monthly CRSP stock
returns, NEI is used in the months immediately following the quarterly earnings announcement date (RDQ) but within
6 months from the fiscal quarter end, to exclude stale earnings. To exclude recording errors, we also require the earnings
announcement date to be after the corresponding fiscal quarter end.
At the beginning of each month t, we rank all stocks into nine portfolios, with lagged NEI in month t − 1 equal to 0, 1,
2, ..., and 8, respectively. We calculate value-weighted portfolio returns for month t and rebalance the portfolios at the
beginning of month t + 1.
Failure probability (FP):

We calculate failure probability (FP) following Campbell, Hilscher, and Szilagyi (2008),
F Pt = − 9.164 − 20.264 N IM T AAV Gt + 1.416 T LM T At − 7.129 EXRET AV Gt
+ 1.411 SIGM At − 0.045 RSIZEt − 2.132 CASHM T At + 0.075 M Bt − 0.058 P RICEt
Detailed variable definitions in the above equation follows closely from Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015).
Quarterly FP is aligned with monthly CRSP stock returns with at least four months gap after the fiscal quarter end, but
within six months after the quarterly earnings announcement date (RDQ). We impose the four-month gap between the
fiscal quarter end and portfolio formation to ensure that all quarterly data items in the definition of FP are available to
public.
At the beginning of each month t, we rank stocks into deciles based on their lagged FP in month t − 1. We calculate
value-weighted decile returns for the subsequent six months from month t to t + 5 and rebalance the deciles at the
beginning of month t + 1. Because of the six-month holding period, in each month, a given FP decile has six sub-deciles
that are initiated in the prior six-month period. Following Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015), we take the simple average of
the six sub-decile returns as the monthly return of each FP decile.

Long-horizon anomalies

Gross profit-to-asset ratio (GP/A):
Following Novy-Marx (2013), we define GP/A as total revenue (Compustat item REVT) minus cost of goods sold (COGS)
for the fiscal year ending in year t − 1, adjusted by current (not lagged) total asset (AT) of fiscal year ending in year
t − 1. At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on GP/A for all fiscal years ending in year
t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of year t + 1 and the deciles are rebalanced at
the end of June of year t + 1.
Cash-based operating profitability (CbOP):
Cash-based operating profitability (CbOP) is defined following Ball, Gerakos, Linnainmaa, and Nikolaev (2016).
Operating profitability is measured as revenue (REVT) minus cost of goods sold (COGS) minus reported sales, general,
and administrative expenses (XSGA – XRD (zero if missing)). Prior to 1988, we use the balance sheet statement and
measure CbOP as operating profitability minus the change in accounts receivable (RECT) minus the change in
inventory (INVT) minus the change in prepaid expenses (XPP) plus the change in deferred revenues (DRC + DRLT)
plus the change in accounts payable (AP) plus the change in accrued expenses (XACC), deflated by current total
assets. Starting from 1988, we use the cash flow statement and measure CbOP as operating profitability plus decrease
in accounts receivable (– RECCH) plus decrease in inventory (– INVCH) plus increase in accounts payable and accrued
liabilities (APALCH), deflated by current total assets.
At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on CbOP for all fiscal years ending in year t − 1.
Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of year t + 1 and the deciles are rebalanced at the end
of June of year t + 1.
Book-to-market equity (B/M):
B/M is defined as the book equity for the fiscal year ending in year t − 1 divided by the market equity at the end of
December of t − 1. Following Davis, Fama, and French (2000), book equity is shareholders’ equity, plus balance sheet
deferred taxes and investment tax credit (TXDITC) if available, minus the book value of preferred stocks. Shareholders’
equity is Compustat item SEQ if available, or the book value of common equity (CEQ) plus the carrying value of
preferred stocks(PSTK), or total assets (AT) minus total liabilities (LT), depending on data availability. Book value of
preferred stocks is the redemption value (PSTKRV), or the liquidating value (PSTKL), or the carrying value of preferred
stocks(PSTK), depending on availability.
At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on B/M for all fiscal years ending in year t − 1.
Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of year t + 1 and the deciles are rebalanced at the end
of June of year t + 1.
Earnings-to-price (E/P):
Following Basu (1983), we measure earnings-to-price (E/P) ratio as income before extraordinary items (IB) for the fiscal
year ending in year t − 1 divided by market equity at the end of December of t − 1. We keep only firms with positive

earnings. At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on E/P for all fiscal years ending in year
t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of year t + 1 and the deciles are rebalanced at
the end of June of year t + 1.
Cash flow-to-price (CF/P):
We measure cash flow (CF) as income before extraordinary items (IB), plus depreciation and amortization (DP), plus
deferred taxes (TXDI, if available). CF/P is calculated as CF for the fiscal year ending in year t − 1 divided by market
equity at the end of December of t − 1. We keep only firms with positive cash flows. At the end of June of each year t,
we sort stocks into deciles based on CF/P for all fiscal years ending in year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated
from July of year t to June of year t + 1 and the deciles are rebalanced at the end of June of year t + 1.
Net payout yield (NPY):
Following Boudoukh, Michaely, Richardson, and Roberts (2007), total payout (O) is dividend on common stock (DVC)
plus repurchase, where repurchase is the purchase of common and preferred stock (PRSTKC) plus any reduction (negative
change over the prior year) in the value of the net number of preferred stocks outstanding (PSTKRV). Net payout (NO) is
total payout minus equity issuance, which is the sale of common and preferred stock (SSTK) minus any increase (positive
change over the prior year) in the value of the net number of preferred stocks outstanding (PSTKRV). Net payout yield
(NPY) is calculated as NO for the fiscal year ending in year t − 1 divided by the market equity at the end of December
of year t − 1.
At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on NPY for all fiscal years ending in year t − 1.
Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of year t + 1 and the deciles are rebalanced at the end
of June of year t + 1.
Equity duration (DUR):
Following Dechow, Sloan, and Soliman (2004), equity duration is calculated as:
PT
PT


t
1 + r M E − t=1 CDt /(1 + r)t
t=1 t × CDt /(1 + r)
DU R =
+ T+
ME
r
ME
where CDt is the net cash distribution of year t, M E is the market equity calculated as price per share times shares
outstanding of year t (P RCC F × CSHO), T is the length of forecasting period, and r is the cost of equity. The
construction of CDt follows closely from Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015). Also, to be consistent with Hou, Xue, and Zhang
(2015), we use a forecasting period of T = 10 and a cost of equity of r = 0.12.
At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on DUR for all fiscal years ending in year t − 1.
Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of year t + 1 and the deciles are rebalanced at the end
of June of year t + 1.
Asset Growth (AG):
Following Cooper, Gulen, and Schill (2008), asset growth is defined as the percentage change in total asset (Compustat
item AT) scaled by beginning total asset. At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on AG for
all fiscal years ending in year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of year t + 1 and
the deciles are rebalanced at the end of June of year t + 1.
Net operating assets (NOA):
Following Hirshleifer, Hou, Teoh, and Zhang (2004), we define net operating assets as NOA = (Operating Assets –
Operating Liabilities)/Lagged Total Assets, where Operating Assets = Total Assets(AT) – Cash and Short-term
Investment (CHE), and Operating Liabilities = Total Assets (AT) – Short-term Debt (DLC) – Long-term Debt (DLTT)
– Minority Interest (MIB) – Preferred Stock (PSTK) – Common Equity (CEQ).
At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on NOA for all fiscal years ending in year t − 1.
Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of year t + 1 and the deciles are rebalanced at the end
of June of year t + 1.
Investment-to-asset ratio (IVA):
Following Lyandres, Sun, and Zhang (2008), we measure IVA as the annual change in gross property, plant, and equipment
(PPEGT) plus the annual change in inventories (INVT) divided by lagged total assets (AT). At the end of June of each

70

year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on IVA for all fiscal years ending in year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are
calculated from July of year t to June of year t + 1 and the deciles are rebalanced at the end of June of year t + 1.
Investment growth (IG):
Following Xing (2008), we measure IG as the percentage change in capital expenditure (CAPX). At the end of June of
each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on IG for all fiscal years ending in year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are
calculated from July of year t to June of year t + 1 and the deciles are rebalanced at the end of June of year t + 1.
Net share issuance (NSI):
Following Pontiff and Woodgate (2008), we measure NSI of fiscal year t − 1 as the natural log of the ratio of split-adjusted
shares outstanding of fiscal year t − 1 to split-adjusted shares outstanding of fiscal year t − 2. The split-adjusted shares
outstanding is the common share outstanding (CSHO) times the adjustment factor (AJEX).
At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on NSI for all fiscal years ending in year t − 1. We
notice that about one quarter of our sample observations have negative NSI (repurchasing firms), and three quarters
with positive NSI (issuing firms). We separately sort repurchasing firms (with negative NSI) into two groups and issuing
firms (with positive NSI) into eight groups using NYSE breakpoints. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of
year t to June of year t + 1 and the deciles are rebalanced at the end of June of year t + 1.
Composite share issuance (CSI):
Following Daniel and Titman (2006), we measure CSI as the growth rate in market equity that is not attributable to the
stock returns, CSIt = log(M Et /M Et−5 ) − r(t − 5, t). Specifically, for CSI in June of year t, M Et is the market equity at
the end of June in year t, M Et−5 is the market equity at the end of June in year t − 5, and r(t − 5, t) is the cumulative
log return on the stock from end of June in year t − 5 to end of June in year t.
At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on CSI measured in June of year t. Monthly decile
returns are calculated from July of year t to June of year t + 1 and the deciles are rebalanced at the end of June of year
t + 1.
Inventory growth (IvG):
Following Belo and Lin (2012), we measure IvG of fiscal year t − 1 as the ratio of inventory (INVT) of fiscal year ending
in year t − 1 over inventory of the fiscal year ending in t − 2. At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles
based on IvG for all fiscal years ending in year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June
of year t + 1 and the deciles are rebalanced at the end of June of year t + 1.
Inventory changes (IvC):
Following Thomas and Zhang (2002), we measure IvC of fiscal year t − 1 as the change in inventory (INVT) from the
fiscal year of t − 2 to the fiscal year of t − 1, scaled by average total assets (AT) of fiscal years t − 2 and t − 1. At the end
of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on IvC for all fiscal years ending in year t − 1. Monthly decile
returns are calculated from July of year t to June of year t + 1 and the deciles are rebalanced at the end of June of year
t + 1.
Operating accruals (OA):
We define operating accruals in a way consistent with Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015). Prior to 1988, we use the balance
sheet approach of Sloan (1996) and measure operating accruals as OA = [(∆Current Assets – ∆Cash) – (∆Current
Liabilities – ∆Short-term Debt – ∆Taxes Payable) – Depreciation and Amortization Expense]/Lagged Total Assets,
where Current Assets is Compustat annual item ACT, Cash is CHE, Current Liabilities is LCT, Short-term Debt is
DLC (zero if missing), Taxes Payable is TXP (zero if missing), Depreciation and Amortization Expense is DP (zero if
missing), and Total Assets is AT.
Starting from 1988, we use the cash flow approach following Hribar and Collins (2002) and measure operating accruals
as OA = [Net Income – Net Cash Flow from Operations]/Lagged Total Assets, where Net Income is NI and Net Cash
Flow from Operations is OANCF. Data from the statement of cash flows are only available since 1988.
At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on OA for all fiscal years ending in year t − 1. Monthly
decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of year t + 1 and the deciles are rebalanced at the end of June
of year t + 1.
Percent operating accruals (POA):

71
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3086063

Following Hafzalla, Lundholm, and Van Winkle (2011), we measure POA as operating accruals (OA) scaled by the
absolute value of net income (Compustat item NI) for the fiscal year ending in year t − 1. At the end of June of each year
t, we sort stocks into deciles based on POA for all fiscal years ending in year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated
from July of year t to June of year t + 1 and the deciles are rebalanced at the end of June of year t + 1.
Percent total accruals (PTA):
We first define total accruals (TA) in a way consistent with Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015). Prior to 1988, we use the
balance-sheet approach of Richardson, Sloan, Soliman, and Tuna (2005) and measure TA as ∆WC + ∆NCO + ∆FIN.
∆WC is the change in net non-cash working capital (WC). WC is current operating asset (COA) minus current operating
liabilities (COL), with COA = current assets (ACT) minus cash and short-term investments (CHE) and COL = current
liabilities (LCT) minus debt in current liabilities (DLC, zero if missing). ∆NCO is the change in net non-current
operating assets (NCO). NCO is non-current operating assets (NCOA) minus non-current operating liabilities (NCOL),
with NCOA = total assets (AT) minus current assets (ACT) minus investments and advances (IVAO, zero if missing),
and NCOL = total liabilities (LT) minus current liabilities (LCT) minus long-term debt (DLTT, zero if missing). ∆FIN
is the change in net financial assets (FIN). FIN is financial assets (FINA) minus financial liabilities (FINL), with FINA =
short-term investments (IVST, zero if missing) plus long-term investments (IVAO, zero if missing), and FINL= long-term
debt (DLTT, zero if missing) plus debt in current liabilities (DLC, zero if missing) plus preferred stock (PSTK, zero if
missing).
Starting from 1988, we use the cash flow approach following Hribar and Collins (2002) and measure TA as net income (NI)
minus total operating, investing, and financing cash flows (OANCF, IVNCF, and FINCF) plus sales of stocks (SSTK,
zero if missing) minus stock repurchases and dividends (PRSTKC and DV, zero if missing). Data from the statement of
cash flows are only available since 1988.
Following Hafzalla, Lundholm, and Van Winkle (2011), we measure PTA as total accruals (TA) scaled by the absolute
value of net income (NI) for the fiscal year ending in year t − 1. At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into
deciles based on PTA for all fiscal years ending in year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t
to June of year t + 1 and the deciles are rebalanced at the end of June of year t + 1.
Organizational capital-to-assets (OC/A):
Following Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou (2013), OC/A is measured using the perpetual inventory method:
OCit = (1 − δ)OCit−1 + SG&Ait /CP It
where SG&A is Selling, General, and Administrative expenses (Compustat item XSGA), CPI is the consumer price index
during year t, and δ is the annual depreciation rate of OC. For detailed definition of each variable, we follow closely Hou,
Xue, and Zhang (2015).
At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on OC/A for all fiscal years ending in year t − 1.
Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of year t + 1 and the deciles are rebalanced at the end
of June of year t + 1.
Advertisement expense-to-market (AD/M):
Following Chan, Lakonishok, and Sougiannis (2001), we measure AD/M as advertising expenses (Compustat item XAD)
for the fiscal year ending in year t − 1 divided by the market equity at the end of December of year t − 1. We keep only
firms with positive advertising expenses. At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on AD/M
for all fiscal years ending in year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of year t + 1
and the deciles are rebalanced at the end of June of year t + 1.
R&D-to-market (RD/M):
Following Chan, Lakonishok, and Sougiannis (2001), we measure RD/M as R&D expenses (Compustat item XRD) for
the fiscal year ending in year t − 1 divided by the market equity at the end of December of year t − 1. We keep only
firms with positive R&D expenses. At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on RD/M for all
fiscal years ending in year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of year t + 1 and the
deciles are rebalanced at the end of June of year t + 1.
Operating leverage (OL):
Following Novy-Marx (2011), OL is measured as cost of goods sold (Compustat item COGS) plus selling, general, and
administrative expenses (Compustat item XSGA) for the fiscal year ending in year t − 1, adjusted by current (not lagged)

total assets (Compustat item AT). At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on OL for all fiscal
years ending in year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of year t + 1 and the deciles
are rebalanced at the end of June of year t + 1.
