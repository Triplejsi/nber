ABSTRACT
A debt trap occurs when someone takes on a high-interest rate loan and is barely able to pay back
the interest, and thus perpetually finds themselves in debt (often by re-financing). Studying such
practices is important for understanding financial decision-making of households in dire
circumstances, and also for setting appropriate consumer protection policies. We conduct a
simple experiment in three sites in which we paid off high-interest moneylender debt of
individuals. Most borrowers returned to debt within six weeks. One to two years .after
intervention, treatment individuals were borrowing at the same rate as control households.

I. Introduction
Small-scale entrepreneurs throughout the developing world often rely on moneylenders
for working capital, borrowing on a daily or weekly basis at exorbitant interest rates. The ubiquity
of this type of borrowing is a long-standing puzzle for development economists: why do these
entrepreneurs not save a little bit and then borrow less, given their implicitly high risk-free rate
of return to savings? We report on three experiments (one in India and two in the Philippines) in
which we gave cash grants and brief financial training to market vendors with high interest rate
debt. We then test how long before, and whether, individuals go back to using high interest rate
debt again.
One striking pattern emerges: most vendors fall back into debt within six weeks, and two
years later the likelihood and volume of borrowing at high interest rates is nearly identical for
treatment and control vendors. The timing of reversion differs across the experiments. A brief,
focused financial education training does little to mitigate this effect. While the average treatment
impact on borrowing is small and short-lived, there are also important differences across
experimental sites. In the first of the two Philippine experiments, about a third of the treated
vendors stayed out of debt for at least six months, although even there we find no difference
between treatment and control debt levels after two years. Also notably, in the second of the two
Philippine experiments, after 18 months the enterprise is generating considerably higher profits
(albeit a puzzle thus still remains as to why individuals do not save, given the high returns to
capital).
These results illuminate the difficulty that small-scale entrepreneurs face in escaping
usage of high interest rate moneylender debt. Not only do borrowers seem unable to save their
way out of debt, but also, even after receiving a windfall grant and being lifted from debt, they
fall back into borrowing at some point in the following months.
This may happen for several reasons and no doubt no single one explains everyone’s
reversion. Thus disentangling and assessing the relative importance of each would require more
observations and data than afforded by our sample, but we explore several possibilities and
consider these fruitful areas for further study. For example, the vendors may be susceptible to
unavoidable consumption and income shocks that force them to return to borrowing. Vendors
may suffer from self-control problems such as present bias. Vendors may not have access to a
reliable savings technology. Finally, vendors may not understand the long-term cost of repeated
borrowing at high interest rates.
Repeated borrowing at high interest rates is not unique to the samples we study (see
Banerjee (2004) for a survey of the literature documenting high interest rate borrowing across
developing countries). More specifically, Banerjee and Duflo (2007) reports borrowing rates from
11% (rural poor in East Timor) to 93% (in Pakistan) across 13 developing countries, oftentimes
from moneylenders. Most relevant for the context of one of our sites, in the same state as our
India experiment, the Yale University Economic Growth Center – Center for Microfinance Tamil
Nadu Panel Survey reports 13% of urban and 39% of rural households borrowing at a monthly

2

interest rate above 5%. 2 This is also a relevant issue in the United States. Skiba and Tobacman
(2011) reports high serial correlation in borrowing from payday lenders among low income
Americans. Bertrand and Morse (2011) reports rates of using one payday loan to pay down
another (and specifically find that informing borrowers of this tendency makes them less likely to
immediately do so).
Our study is also related to the literature on unconditional cash grants for small-scale
entrepreneurs (e.g. de Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff 2008). Many of these studies estimate
return to capital in excess of 5% per month. Those studies are on a more representative sample
frame than we study here, as they did not specifically target individuals borrowing from highinterest moneylenders, and rather than focus on profits, we focus on debt reversion. Although a
different context, Hankins et al. (2011) analyzes the impact of a cash windfall from winning the
lottery and finds that winners who received $50,000 to $150,000 filed for bankruptcy at the same
rate as smaller winners.

II. Experimental Design and Data
We conducted three experiments: Chennai, India in 2007 (1000 market vendors), Cagayan
de Oro, Philippines in 2007 (250 market vendors), and Cagayan de Oro, Philippines in 2010 (701
market vendors, from different markets than in 2007). Each experiment took place in urban
market settings. Going stall to stall, we identified individuals eligible for the study based on the
following criteria: (1) they were the decision-maker of the business, (2) they borrowed
consistently from a professional moneylender (defined as interest rate at or above 5% per month,
although most debt was considerably more expensive) for the past five years, and (3) they had an
outstanding balance of US$100 or below in the Philippines or US$50 or below in India with
moneylenders. 3 Borrowers in the Indian sample paid an average daily interest rate of 4.7%, while
borrowers in both Philippines samples paid an average monthly interest rate of 13%.
Both 2007 experiments included the same four equal-sized treatment arms: debt payoff;
financial education; debt payoff and financial education; and, control. We implemented a brief
financial training in small groups of roughly 25 vendors by a professional survey team. In the
Philippines, 105 out of the 125 vendors invited to the training attended 4 and only nominal
compensation was given for attendance. 5 In India, 434 out of 500 individuals attended the
financial training. The training emphasized two messages: (1) that lending at high rates from
moneylenders led to a large loss of money and thus consumption every year compared with other
alternatives, and (2) that savings and consumption discipline could help vendors avoid having to

https://egcenter.economics.yale.edu/egc-cmf-tamil-nadu-panel-survey-overview
We restricted the sample to borrowers with less than this amount of debt so that we could pay off their
entire debt, thus making analysis of the extensive margin more likely relevant.
4
Many of the twenty vendors who declined to come to the training said that they could not afford to take
time away from their stalls. Also, several vendors were not present at the time when invitations were given.
5
Vendors were given transportation, light refreshments, a coffee mug, and a certificate of completion in
the Philippines, and in India they were given a steel money box with locks and engraving that said "IFMR,
Financial training class, July 2007" (in tamil) with the intent of reminding them in the future about the
lessons learned in the class and 100 Rs to compensate generously for transport costs.

take out loans at all. The training included interactive activities, discussion, and lecture. The
Appendix includes a summary of the financial planning curriculum.
In the 2010 Philippines experiment, participants were randomized into one of four
groups: debt payoff; savings account; debt payoff and savings account; and, control. All three
treatment groups also received a 5-10 minutes financial education lesson (i.e., slightly briefer than
the 2007 financial education, but no longer separately tested as its own treatment arm). Because
of problems with insufficient compliance with account opening requirements (specifically,
providing necessary documentation and identification), only 10 savings accounts were opened,
and thus there is nothing to analyze with respect to the savings account treatment arms. For
analysis, we collapse this wave to two groups: debt payoff and financial training (with and without
the offered savings account) and control.
In all three sites, the financial training was conducted prior to the announcement of the
debt payoff. Several days after the financial training, surveyors went to those selected for debt
payoff and informed them they had won a prize through the lottery. In the Philippines, as debt
collectors generally collect repayments daily in this area, surveyors waited until the collectors
arrived and paid off the debt in view of the vendors. In India, individuals were instructed to come
to a central location to pickup money if they were in a debt payoff treatment group. The amount
paid was equal to the amount the debt collector said was owed, up to 5,000 pesos (US$100) in
the Philippines or 3000 rupees (US$50) in India. Across debt payoff treatments, average debt relief
was 2172 pesos (US$44) in the Philippines 2007 site, 3234 pesos (US$70) in the Philippines 2010
site, and 751 rupees (US$17) in the India site. 6
The 2007 Philippines and India experiments did not employ stratification. The 2010
Philippines experiment stratified on quintile of preexisting debt level. Baseline surveys measured
(a) the history of their savings and debt over the past few years, (b) basic cognitive skills and
educational level, (c) mental health that could be linked to ability to fulfill plans, (d) business
information, e.g. assets and revenues, and (e) demographic data. Appendix Table 1 presents
baseline statistics and verification of orthogonality of assignments to treatment.
We conducted four follow-up surveys, starting 4-6 weeks after the debt payoff, and
ending at the latest 2 years after the debt payoff. See Figure 1 for a summary of the timing of each
experiment’s data. Follow-up surveys measured (a) whether the vendors had moneylender and
other types of debt, (b) what changes have occurred in the business (i.e., if the business has
expanded significantly or not) (c) any shocks the household has experienced, and how they coped,
(d) some components of consumption, (e) savings.
In the 2007 India experiment, 881 of 1000 completed all four follow-up surveys. In the
2007 Philippines experiment, 206 of 250 completed all four follow-up surveys. In the 2010
Philippines experiment, 569 of 701 completed all four follow-up surveys. Appendix Table 1
presents orthogonality results for comparison of attrition rates. Out of 13 comparisons across the
three sites, we reject equality of survey attrition rates in one test, the Philippines 2010 site (76%

III. Results
Tables 1 – 3 present the impact of our treatments in India 2007, Philippines 2007 and
Philippines 2010, respectively. 7 Across all columns in each table, the specification is

𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + � 𝛽𝛽𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ∗ 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 + 𝛾𝛾1 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖0 + 𝛾𝛾2 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 + 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡

where 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 refers to an outcome for respondent 𝑖𝑖 in wave 𝑡𝑡, 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is an indicator for
whether respondent 𝑖𝑖 was assigned treatment 𝑗𝑗, 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 is a dummy for wave 𝑡𝑡, yi0 is the baseline
value of the outcome variable for respondent 𝑖𝑖, and 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 is a vector of dummy variables for quintile
of preexisting debt at baseline for respondent 𝑖𝑖 (used in Philippines 2010 only). Throughout,
standard errors are clustered at the respondent level.

Columns 1 and 2 of each table report treatment impact on the primary outcome variable:
moneylender borrowing (column 1 is binary for “has any outstanding moneylender debt”, and
column 2 is the amount of outstanding moneylender debt). In India 2007 (Table 1), borrowers
granted debt relief only were 17pp (se=4pp) less likely to borrow from a moneylender after the
first follow-up, and borrowed only US$8 (se=$2) less on average, relative to a control mean debt
of US$25. Financial training had no direct impact on borrowing (treatment effect is a reduction in
borrowing of 2pp, se=3pp). The combined treatments of debt payoff and financial training
produced results similar to the debt payoff only treatment arm: a reduction in borrowing of 20pp
(se=4pp) and a reduction of US$6 (se=$2). By the second follow-up (5-8 months), however,
treatment effects had already mostly dissipated: -6pp (se=4pp) for debt payoff only; and -9pp
(se=4pp) for debt payoff and financial training. By the third follow-up (9-10 months), all results
were no longer statistically significant: +3pp (se=4pp) for debt payoff only and -5pp (se=4pp) for
the debt payoff and financial training. Effects on amount borrowed similarly dissipated (Column
2).
Effects were somewhat larger and more persistent in the Philippines 2007 site, (Table 2).
Borrowers offered debt relief were 37pp (se=8pp) less likely to borrow from a moneylender at the
first follow-up and by the third follow-up they remain 28pp (se=9pp) less likely to borrow. They
borrowed US$47 (se=$15) less at first follow-up and by third follow-up borrowed US$46 (se=$18)
less, relative to a control mean borrowing of US$82. At the final measurement treatment effects
have entirely dissipated, but we note that we focused the final measurement on just moneylender
loans used for working capital. Thus for this site we unfortunately cannot distinguish whether the
treatment effect truly dissipated, or whether it was merely concentrated in the portion of debt

not captured in our final survey wave. 8 Financial training had no impact on its own (first followup: 0pp, se=7pp; second follow-up: 0pp, se=7pp; third follow-up: 1pp, se=8pp; fourth follow-up:
-2pp, se=9pp). The treatment effects for the combined debt payoff and financial training were
larger than the debt payoff treatments (e.g., 47pp reduction vs 37pp reduction for the first followup), however the t-test of equality of treatment effects yields p-values of 0.29, 0.06, 0.10, and
0.08 across the four waves. Hence there is some suggestive evidence that the financial training in
Philippines slowed the reversion rate back into moneylender debt, but by the final follow-up at
18 months the effect of the combined treatment was also null (-5pp, se=8pp).
The Philippines 2010 (Table 3) results are more similar to the India 2007 site: borrowers
granted debt relief were only about 9pp less likely to borrow from a moneylender after the first
follow-up (se=4pp), and borrowed only US$33 less on average, relative to a control mean debt of
US$126 (se=$10). The second (4 months), third (8 months) and fourth (18-19 months) follow-ups
all yielded null results: -5pp (se=4pp); -1pp (se=4pp); -4pp (se=4pp) for the likelihood of having
moneylender debt.
Columns 3 – 5 report impacts on household coping mechanisms in response to income
shocks. In India and the Philippines 2010 all impacts were small and short lived, while effects in
Philippines 2007 are larger, though still modest. 9
In India, at first follow-up vendors who got debt relief were 12pp (se=5pp) more likely to
use savings to cope with low household income but by second follow-up that effect is not
statistically significant. Similarly, they are 6pp (se=3pp) less likely to respond to low household
income by reducing consumption, but the effect vanishes by second follow-up. Financial training
seems to have no impact.
In Philippines 2007, at first follow-up, households offered debt relief only are 45pp
(se=12pp) less likely to respond to low income by borrowing and those offered debt relief and
financial training are 33pp (se=14pp) less likely. This effect dissipates for the debt relief only
treatment arm, but mostly does not for the combined debt relief and financial training treatment
arm: second follow-up treatment effect is +16pp (se=20pp); third follow-up is -44pp (se=16pp);
fourth follow-up is -24pp (se=13pp).
Effects in the Philippines 2010 are similar to India (again). If anything, Table 3 Column 4
shows a 16pp (se=9pp) increase in the likelihood that households respond to an income shock by
borrowing money. While the size of this effect fluctuates across waves, in the fourth follow-up
households granted debt relief are 20pp (se=6pp) more likely to respond to an income shock by

While in follow-ups 1-3, the debt module covers all outstanding loans, the debt module in follow-up 4 asks
about all outstanding loans but only if the respondent has taken loans as a source of funding for working
capital at least one day of the past 30 days. The change was made for clarity in response to surveyor
feedback. While 189 respondents had at least one outstanding loan, only 95 respondents had taken out
loans as a source of funding for working capital at least one day of the past 30 days.

Across Columns 3 - 5 in Tables 1 - 3 we treat an observation as missing if they do not suffer a household
shock in the relevant wave. In Appendix Tables A5 - A7 we present the same regressions where instead we
households who suffer a shock are coded as not responding to a shock through the relevant method.

borrowing money. This may be spurious, however, since the effect is not present in the second or
third follow-ups.
Column 6 reports impacts on household expenditures. 10 Across the board, debt relief had
little to no impact on expenditure. Column 7 reports impacts on vendors’ savings. In all sites
vendors who received debt relief are no more likely to have any form of savings at the final followup (though in India there is a small increase in savings for those who received financial training).
Finally, Column 8 reports impact on profits. In India effects are small and short-lived. By
the second follow-up, we cannot reject that profits of the treatment and control groups are the
same. In Philippines 2007 the point estimate on profits is large, though imprecisely estimated. In
Philippines 2010 there seems to have been a sustained impact on profits. At fourth follow-up,
vendors offered debt relief earned an extra US$1.15 (se=$0.59) of profits on a typical day, relative
to a control mean of US$6.9.
Taken together these results suggest that, for the most part, the impact of debt relief was
modest and fleeting on debt levels. In India and the Philippines 2010, effects on borrowing were
small at first follow-up and dissipated by the second follow-up. In Philippines 2007 the impact on
borrowing was somewhat larger and more persistent, though more than half of the vendors
offered debt relief were already back in debt by first follow-up.

IV. Interpretation and Discussion
It is puzzling how and why small-scale entrepreneurs repeatedly borrow for working
capital at high moneylender interest rates. It implies stark savings constraints (why did individuals
not save their way out of debt, given the high return on savings), or high returns to capital (but
then again, why not save and expand even more), or other behavioral constraints. With many
possible explanations for this phenomenon, distinguishing between them requires more power
than our sample affords. But with an eye toward guiding future research on this subject we discuss
a few explanations below and put forward some suggestive evidence.
A first possibility is that entrepreneurs have such high returns to investment that
continuous borrowing at high interest rates is justified from the perspective of long-term profit
maximization. The results from the two Philippines experiments but not the India experiment
provide some support for this hypothesis – at final measurement, profits in the 2007 treatment
group were $5.35/day (se=$4.83) higher than in the control group and profits in the 2010
treatment group were $1.15/day (se=$0.59) higher than in the control group. Thus the 2007 debt
payoff led to a very large but noisily estimated treatment effect on enterprise income, and the
2010 led to a fairly large ($1.15 = 1.7% daily return) and statistically significant result. This
hypothesis is bolstered by the fact that the 2010 treatment group invested an additional $81.9 in
working capital relative to the control group at final follow up (se = $28.61). However, even if
vendors found it profitable to invest their grants in their business and return to debt, a puzzle still
remains: as vendors reach diminishing returns to investment, they should no longer borrow to

expand their investment, and standard theory then predicts a corresponding reduction in
borrowing as vendors slowly save their way out of debt (Ananth, Karlan, and Mullainathan 2007)
Table 4 examines several other potential explanations by estimating heterogeneous
treatment effects using the following specification:

𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + � 𝛽𝛽𝑗𝑗 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑒𝑒𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + � θ𝑘𝑘 𝐻𝐻𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 + � 𝜙𝜙𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 𝐻𝐻𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 ∗ 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝛾𝛾1 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖0 + 𝛾𝛾2 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
𝑗𝑗

𝑘𝑘

𝑗𝑗,𝑘𝑘

where 𝐻𝐻𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 is the 𝑘𝑘’th characteristic of interest for vendor 𝑖𝑖, and all other variables are defined as
above. Robust standard errors are clustered at the vendor level. We present the estimates for the
first follow-up in Table 4, and Appendix Tables A11, A12 and A13 present the same for the second,
third and fourth follow-ups.
The second possibility we consider is that vendors suffer from time inconsistent
preferences, such as present bias, or temptation challenges (Strotz 1955; Shefrin and Thaler 1992;
Laibson 1997; O’Donoghue and Rabin 1999; Fudenberg and Levine 2006). In Table 4 we explore
heterogeneous treatment effects of debt relief and financial training with respect to the level of
present bias displayed by vendors at baseline. Vendors were asked to make hypothetical tradeoffs
between differing amounts of money delivered at different times and were defined to be present
biased if they exhibited lower patience for tradeoffs that included immediate payoffs. 11 We find
little evidence of heterogeneity with respect to time inconsistency, although the confidence
intervals on the heterogeneity are wide and often include the point estimate for the main
treatment effect.
A third possibility is that borrowers lack a savings technology that allows them to
accumulate capital and stay out of debt. Without a secure place to store capital, saving may be
constrained by family pressures (e.g., Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin 2010; Schaner 2015; Jakiela and
Ozier 2016), self-control (Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin 2006b; Dupas and Robinson 2013b), or mere
safety and low transaction costs (Dupas and Robinson 2013a; Prina 2015; Dupas et al. 2017). We
explore heterogeneous treatment effects with respect to whether the vendor had a formal bank
account at baseline. The results are noisy and fluctuate in sign, providing little evidence in support
of this theory (but also fail to reject this theory). In India, vendors offered financial training were
given a moneybox as a light touch intervention to support savings (similar to the box used by
Ashraf et al. (2006b, 2006a) and Dupas and Robinson (2013a). That these borrowers returned to
debt at equal rates as their payoff-only counterparts is weakly suggestive that a safe place to save
is not the constraining factor. We also attempted to explore this hypothesis directly by opening
formal savings accounts for some vendors in the Philippines 2010 experiment, but because of the
implementation obstacles referenced above, this treatment was abandoned.

The time inconsistent preferences indicator variable is based on two questions at baseline that capture
time preference reversal. It equals 1 for those willing to forfeit a certain amount of money to receive the
sum today instead of in 30 days but unwilling to forfeit this same amount of money to receive the sum in 6
months instead of 7 months.

11

A fourth possibility is that venders do not understand the long-term cost of repeated
borrowing at high rates. The financial training was explicitly designed to address this potential
misperception, and had little effect on vendors’ overall borrowing. That said, as with all training
modules, there remains a confound between the efficacy of communication and the value of
information being communicated; i.e., perhaps the training was not well executed. We also
explore heterogeneous treatment effects with respect to an index of financial literacy and ability
to answer basic mathematical questions. 12 In India, of vendors offered debt relief, those with
higher mathematical ability are more likely to stay out of debt at first follow-up, although across
other sites the estimates are noisy and fluctuate in sign.
A final possibility is that vendors suffer frequent shocks to their income and upon
experiencing such a shock revert to borrowing as a method of smoothing. Vendors who suffer an
income shock but already have substantial debt to moneylenders may face a binding borrowing
constraint, with no other option than to reduce their consumption. By offering vendors debt
relief, we may have relaxed this borrowing constraint, improving their ability to smooth their
income until they fell back into debt and their borrowing constraint once again became binding.
This is consistent with the results from Philippines 2010 in which we see that vendors offered debt
relief are more likely to respond to low household income by borrowing in both the first followup and fourth follow-up, although in India and Philippines 2007 the effect on borrowing to smooth
income shocks seems to be reversed.
To test this hypothesis, we use baseline characteristics to predict likelihood to experience
an income shock in each follow-up wave and each site. We then include likelihood of a shock in
the test for heterogeneous treatment effects. 13 The estimates for India and Philippines 2007
provide weak evidence suggesting that vendors more likely to experience an income shock were
less successful at staying out of debt.

The financial literacy index is made up of 7 baseline variables: whether they regret a purchase from the
past week, whether they spend time developing a financial plan (not included in India 2007), whether they
have ever created a financial plan (not included in Phil. 2010), whether the HH mostly/always sticks to the
financial plan (not included in Phil. 2010), whether the HH regularly sets a detailed budget, whether they
agree that without a plan HH spending would go up, and whether the HH regularly tracks their spending.
Each of the components is standardized against the control mean at baseline and all the components are
then averaged and standardized to create a single score. The math skills index is made up of 3 baseline
variables in India 2007 and Phil. 2007 and 4 baseline variables in Phil. 2010, each a word problem testing
basic math skills. Each of the components is standardized against the control mean at baseline and all the
components are then averaged and standardized to create a single score.
13
The likelihood of experiencing an income shock comes from 11 separate probit regressions using 12
baseline variables to predict the probability of a household income shock in each survey wave within each
site. The baseline variables used for these prediction models are the total value of business assets (USD),
the value of merchandise bought per trip to market on average day (USD), the approximate taken-home
profit typical day (USD), whether they save when excess profits on a good day, whether they have borrowed
from money lender for working capital, the amount borrowed from money lenders for working capital
(USD), whether an unexpected event caused a household income shock, whether they currently have any
form of savings, their current amount of savings (USD), household size, household total expenditures (USD),
and total monthly household income (USD). See Appendix Tables A14-A16 for the output of each probit
regression.

These mechanisms are important distinctions for policy. If, for example, the issue is driven
by financial literacy and poor planning, such as an underestimate of the likely future costs of
borrowing, public policies which require disclosure policies focused on this likelihood may change
behavior (e.g., see Bertrand and Morse (2011)). Similarly, if return to debt is driven by unabsorbed
shocks, this makes salient how debt is filling in a missing insurance market for the poor.
Improvements to social protection policies and insurance markets may help alleviate a problem
erroneously perceived as a credit market problem. Evidence for this argument also comes from
South Africa, in which borrowing at high interest rates (circa 200% APR) from a consumer microlender helped individuals absorb shocks, which led to an increase in likelihood of being employed
a year later and consequently a reduction in the poverty headcount ratio (Karlan and Zinman
2010). This suggests both that shutting down or restricting credit markets, even at high interest
rates, may lead to downward spirals even worse than perpetual borrowing. Thus the large gap
between borrowing and lending interest rates in developing countries should be a call to action
to understand how to bring down costs for lending, not a cause to shut down credit markets. At
current rates, however, this experiment demonstrates the importance of learning more about
what individuals are doing with high interest moneylender debt, the circumstances of their
decisions to borrow, and what market changes could satisfy their needs without warranting such
expensive borrowing.
Further research could help tremendously both to understand how and why and for
whom debt reversion occurs (in line with the above discussion), as well as establish specific
interventions which ameliorate the issue. For example, options include a stronger
implementation of the savings intervention; an alternative approach to the financial education;
more behavioral science-motivated interventions such as reminders or commitment contracts.

observations missing at baseline, whenever unavailable), a survey wave fixed effect, and a vector of dummy variables for quintile of preexisting debt at baseline. 4. Column 1 is whether they borrowed from a money
lender for working capital, column 2 is the amount they borrowed from a money lender for working capital in USD, column 3 is whether they coped with a HH income shock by using savings (missing if no HH income
shock), column 4 is whether they coped with a HH income shock by borrowing (missing if no HH income shock), column 5 is whether they coped with a HH income shock by cutting consumption (missing if no HH
income shock), column 6 is total monthly HH expenditures in USD, column 7 is whether they currently have any form of savings, column 8 is their approximate take-home business profit on a typical day in USD, and
column 9 is worth of current business assets plus amount spent on an average restocking trip minus current or daily loans owed. 5. For columns 3-5, at baseline, of those that experienced an income shock, 59.2%
experienced one from family sickness/accident/death, 6.9% from slow business, and 6.3% from unemployment.

START:
Introduction of class and trainer;
Present goal of the workshop: We are here to discuss your business, your borrowing habits,
amount of money you are spending on interest payment and how you can increase your overall
income.
SECTION A: AWARENESS OF PROBLEM
Part 1. Awareness of the problem
Ask for a volunteer who is willing to share his/her borrowing information. (Choose
someone that takes a high interest moneylender loan for working capital, e.g. Bombay loans at
20% a month interest and working capital of 5000 to 6000 pesos.)
Find out how many days she opens shop in a week. (Choose someone whose profile we
expect to be a high interest to profit ratio person for dramatic effect)

Ask her if she has an idea of how much income she made last year.
Ask her and a few more volunteers if they can guess how much cumulative loan amount
and interest amount paid last year.
Ask a few more people to guess and write on a piece of paper and put it aside
Tell the class lets discuss her finances.
Ask her if her income is enough or if there are things she would like to buy or consume
but doesn’t have enough money for it.
Ask her and write out:
o How much gross profits she made on an average day last week;
o How much she paid on an average day in interest last week in moneylender loans;
o How much she paid on an average day in interest last week in rural bank;
Write out total profits and total interest for moneylender loans and rural banks separately
Multiply by 50 weeks and write down the figures on the board.
Show on the board how much gross profits she made.
Compare it to total interest paid.
Subtract and show how much she actually consumed. Compute the above yearly figures
for the past 5 and 10 years.

POINT: The interest paid is from her profits from labor and hard work; that for want of 1
day’s working capital money she is losing so much money in a year in interest.

What does the difference buy you?
--xx years of elementary schooling fee: tuition, supplies, uniform, miscellaneous
fees
--xx days of food consumption
Ask her what she would do with the interest money if she had kept it instead of paying it
to money lender;
Ask her if she would like to discuss ways to enjoy that money rather than pay as interest;

Note to instructor: Be sure to never talk ill about the money lender. And to tell the class to not
burn bridges with them and to keep this training content from the money lender.
Part 2. Why do you borrow from moneylenders?
•
•
•

Why do you keep borrowing from moneylenders?
Do you think you can manage without borrowing from moneylenders?
Give examples of vendors who do not borrow on daily moneylender loans to show
another world is possible.

POINT: It is possible to change the behaviors to enjoy the money that you pay to the money
lenders.
SECTION B: SAVINGS
Savings is money put aside by an individual or household for use in the future
1. Why save?
• Ask the class what are the benefits of savings are:
o Many situations (both expected and unexpected) in which you will need a
lump-sum of money larger than the regular flow of income
o Fiesta, birth, education, emergencies, and discovery of investment
opportunities
o Less need to borrow, which comes with cost
2. Different ways to save
• Ask the class what the “Non-cash forms of savings” are:
o Jewelry
o Land
o Livestock
These items could easily be converted into cash
• Savings at home
o Disadvantages: temptation to spend, risk of theft
• Paluwagan / Thandal
o Advantages: encourages discipline, support among members
o Disadvantages: no interest earning, depends on group solidarity
• Formal savings
o Advantages: safely saved, interest earning
o Disadvantages: transportation cost

3. How to save?
•

•

•

“Managing money well begins with hanging on to what you have. This means
avoiding unnecessary expenditure and then finding a safe place to store whatever
money is left over. Making that choice—the choice to save rather than to
consume—is the foundation of money management.”
Making a Savings Plan
1. Set savings goals (we discussed about this in the last section)
2. Figure out how much you need to save over what period of time to meet your
goals
3. Figure out how much you need to save on weekly and daily basis
4. Figure out where you can find that amount in your budget (using business
income, cutting unnecessary expenses)
5. Decide where you will save
6. Keep track of the savings
Work with the class to set their savings goals

4. Helping you save
• Commitment savings
• Lock box
• Keys to successful savings
o Save as much as you can as soon as you can. The more you save, the
better off you’ll be.
o Put aside the money for saving first, then allocate the rest of the money for
spending
o Calculate how your money can grow over time if you save regularly in an
account that earns interest.
o Don’t save at home—avoid temptation to spend it!
o Spend carefully
o Find savings product that matches your savings goal and personality
SECTION C: DEBT MANAGEMENT
1. What is DEBT?
• Ask the class: What does “debt” mean to you?
“What you owe when you borrow something—cash or tangible goods from
someone else, or when you purchase on credit.”

65

2. Cost of borrowing
• Cost of borrowing is usually the interest rate you pay
• Give examples from the class
o Loan amount
o Daily payment
o Loan term
o How much is the interest amount?
o How much is the interest rate?
• Do a few more examples and have the class work on interest amount and rate
calculation.
3. Why borrow?
• Ask the class: What do you borrow?
• Write out the reasons for borrowing
• Explain that there are three reasons for borrowing:
a) To invest
b) To respond to an unexpected emergency (e.g. sickness of family member,
natural disaster, etc.)
c) To consume (e.g. pay for rent, buy food to eat)
Loans provide you with a lump sum of money that might be difficult to obtain
otherwise;
• What are the advantages and disadvantages of borrowing?
Advantages:
o Gain access to more money than you have
o You get money quickly when you need it
Disadvantages:
o You pay the cost of borrowing (interest is the price of borrowing)
o You face the responsibility to repay on time (tiring)
o You face penalties for late payment
o You face loss of confidence and self-esteem when you can’t repay
o You may not be able to borrow if you can’t repay
• All these disadvantages that you face as a consequence of not being able to repay is
called “RISK”
• How about using your own money (savings, profits, etc.)?
Advantages
o Avoid cost of borrowing
o You are free to use your money as you wish
o You avoid the obligation of continuous repayment
Disadvantages
o You have limited amount of money
o You have limited amount to invest, respond to unexpected emergency, and to
consume
POINT: Borrowing is NOT the same as using your own money you have from your
business profits or savings.

4. Bad debt, Good debt—How do you decide when and how much to borrow?
There are advantages and disadvantages of borrowing. Borrowing is NOT always bad,
but the risks that come with taking a loan should make you think carefully about when and how
much to borrow.
•
•

Borrowing is good when it helps you gain financially and bad when it becomes a
financial burden.
Two key questions when calculating how much debt to afford:
1) What percentage of my household/business budget can I afford to make
available for debt repayment? Will I have enough left over to adequately
cover other household expenses?
2) What are the consequences if I cannot repay my loan?

5. Controlling debt
a. Don’t borrow more than you can afford to repay Budgeting is the key to realize
how much you can afford
b. Save money regularly for emergencies
c. Warning signs
• Using credit to purchase things you once bought with cash
• Getting loans or borrowing from family/friends to pay your debts
• Using savings to repay loans
POINT: Borrowing is not our enemy, but bad credit habits are!
SECTION D: FOLLOW-UP CLASS
1. Review of above
2. Review of their maintenance of their accounts since first class
3. A little quiz to see if they grasped everything
Best practices
1. Tailor program for illiterates; avoid too much of written word
2. Hire trainer from an SHG or similar who is from the same socio-economic background as
participants. In fact ask the union to nominate volunteers from its members to be trained
and in turn to train their peers.
3. Have follow-up class
4. Class size of 25 max
5. Do a focus group discussion with some potential participants to understand their needs,
get feedback on curriculum, method of instructions, dates, logistics etc
6. Pay them money to attend (like say a day’s profits); take up tends to be low for these
things
7. Market it well to maximize take up
