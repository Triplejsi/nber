Macroeconomic Effects of Price Control:
The Role of Market Structure

ABSTRACT

Price controls were part of Israel's stabilization program of

July 1985. Some results of the program seem to be inconsistent
with competitive macroeconomic models. It is suggested that these
results are consistent with an economy that has an oligopolistic

market structure. The paper explores the effects of market
structure on macroeconomic performance in the presence and absence
of price control.

analysis clarifies a njor effect of nBrket structure. In the following
section (Section II) I construct a siule, conpetitiie, ntzltisector economy,

and study its inlicat ions for the contuirent of uariables in the presence of

price controls. In Section III I construct a nDdel with oligopolistic
con-petition and study the sane set of questions. The reader can see in Table
2 soire of the resulting differences. £n application of these theoretical
findings to the Israeli case is illustrated in Section IV.

It is argued that

the mn-plications of the corrpetititie nodel are inconsistent with the data,

v.tiile the inplications of the nonccmpetitiue nodel are consistent ;nth them.

I. Partial FuiIibrjum
fin inportant insight into the effects of price controls tn-ider different

irerket structures can be obtained from a partial equilibrium analysis.
Consider Fig. 1. Panel (a) describes a conpetititye industry. Without price

controls the equilibrium price is p, viich is determined by the intersection

of the nrg inc I cost cur'e !t and

the

denBnd curt,e D. Now, if price

controls reduce the price to p°, then there is an excess denund fiB. In this
case the actually transacted quantity is determined by point f, thich
represents the short side of the nurket. Hence, output is supply determined,
and price controls bring about a contraction of output.

Now consider panel (b), kich describes

a

firm with sone degree of

nonopoly poer. Curie D describes the dei-rand curi,e faced by the firm, with
the associated nurginal re'enue curue PIR.

Its nurginal

determined by the intersection of

with ?t, and the equilibrium price is

found on the demand curve at the point that corresponds to this quantity.

Hence, p is the equilibrium price. Now suppose that price controls are
iapasad, with p being the price ceiling. Then the £ irm' s marginal revenue

cur.'e becorres the horizontal line at the level p up to point C, then it

drops to F, and coincides with NR for larger output levels. In this case
profit maximization makes the firm supply the entire demand at the controlled

price. This is true for euery price ceiling above point E. Hence, as long as
the price ceiling is aboue E, there is no excess demand, output is demand
determined, and price controls bring about an expansion of output. These
results are radically different from those derived for the conpetitir.e case.

Only en price controls are severe enough to reduce the price below E will

shortages appear. Take, for exaiple, p to be the price ceiling. Then the
reletiant marginal ret7enue curve becorres the horizontal line up to B, dropping

from B to G, and coinciding with !IR £ or higher output levels. In this
case point

represents the intersection of the marginal revenue with the

marginal cost curve, vhile point B represents the demanded quantity at the

controlled price. Hence, there is an excess demand equal to . Observe,
hot.ier, that in this case too output is higher than in the uncontrolled case,
despite there being shortages. Only then the price ceiling falls below the

intersection of 1R with It do price controls bring about shortages with a

lor level of output.
This analysis shows that in a conpetititie market price controls lead to

shortages and a decline of output, with the output level supply determined. On

—5—

the other

hand, in a narket with oligopolistic firms, nuderate price controls

do not lead to shortages,

and output——thich

is denund determined—-increases.

harve, therefore, a potential explanation of the lack of shortages in the

Israeli economy, that '.s discussed in the introduction. In order to see that
this explanation is also consistent with the data reported in Table 1,

need

to derelop a nore elaborate nudel, taking into account sonu general

equilibrium interactions. Hou'er, since it is not the purpose of this paper
to study in detail the Israeli economy, but rather to point out the inportance
of narket structure for macroeconomic performance in the presence of price
controls, I first discuss in sonu detail the perfectly conpetitive case.

II.

Perfect

Conpetition

Consider a conpetitire economy that produces tw coimuxlities: a traded
product that is exported but not consuned donestically, arid a nontraded

product. Their production functions are f.(.e.),
.e.

is

i=X,M, respectively, ere

labor use of a representatir.ie firm in sector i. The functions f.(.)

are strictly concave, thich can be justified by the existence of firm specific

inputs. Sector i is conposed of n. firms and aggregate labor supply is
L.

(The nunter of firms plays no essential role in this section; it is

introduced in order to facilitate a conparison with the next section.)

Domastic consuners have honothetic preferences over the nontraded product
arid the iirported product. These preferences inply that the share of spending

on product i,

i=N, I (iiere I stands for inports) is an honogeneos

function of degree zero of consuner prices p., i=N,I. The share functions

Equation (6) defines the sw-plus in the trade account. Given the level of

Aggregate spending can

be nodeled in many vnys. It can, for exanple, be

derived from intertenporal optimization subject to an intertenporal budget
constraint only——provided capital markets are perfect—-or with additional
2

constraints if capital markets are inperfect (such as liquidity constraints).
An extrene form energes if no borrowing and lending are possible, in kiich

case spending has to equal incone. Naturally, v are interested in the
effects of changes in aggregate spending. These may result from policy changes

interternporal maximization in the presence of perfect capital markets. Let
the intertenporal utility function be

c1(t)]dt,

vAiere p is the subjective discount rate, t is a tine index! cN(t) is
consunption of nontradeables at tine t, and c1(t) is consunption of
inportables at tine t. Then the maximization of this function subject to the

intertenporal budget constraint Cexp(—rt)[pN(t)cN(t) +

p1(t)c1(t)Jdt

vtere r is the interest rate (assuned to be constant) and

is the

present value of future net incone plus current bond holdings, yields the
expenditure function E(t) = p exp[(r ttere

p)tJ140,

E(t) e PN(t)cN(t) +

p1(t)c1(t).

Hence, expenditure is rising over tine if the

interest rate is larger than the private discount rate and it is declining
over tine if the interest rate is smaller than the private discount rate.
Another representation of this expenditure function is by neans of
E(t) = p14(t), ;tere 14(t) =exp{(r -p)t]140 is the present value of future

incone plus current bond holdings in period t.

insights to the problem at hand, I hac'e chosen to treat aggregate spending as

Ibreouer, as a result of shortages in periods of price controls consuners are
typically not able to attain the nest desirable allocation of spending across

goods. Under these circumstances they ny choose to reallocate spending Oxier
tine in order to minimize the trntility loss from these constraints. This

represents another channel through ich price controls affect spending. It
is clear from this discussion and from further reflection that spending

depends on price controls in a conplicated y; it depends on the nature of
controls, on the preuailing rationing mschanism in case of shortages, their
timing, and the like. For this reason I ha.'e chosen to treat spending as

along XX and rises along NM (see Nrndel1 (1971, clip. 9) for a similar

Now suppose that aggregate spending increases. Then the NM curue

shifts to the right and the new equilibrium point is B. t B both prices
are higher, hut the relati'e price of exports is 1or. Hence, the price of
exports increases proportionately less than the price of nontradeailes. It is

now clear from (7)—(8) that at B exports are lo;r and output of
nontradeables is higher than at l. The increase in the price of
nontradeables relati've to ixports increases the share of spending on inports.

Together with the initial increase in aggregate spending this increases the

talue of inparts. Since the higher price of exports reduces export earnings
(under the assunpt ion that the price elasticity of export demand is larger

than one) the trade account surplus declines. Finally, since both prices of

donestic output increase, the ge rate -- gi7en by w =

The next step is to consider price controls. is explained in the
introduction, the nntiiation for this analysis comas from the use of price

controls in stabilization programs. This takes typically the following form.
There is a currency deualuation, vhile domastic currency prices are not

— 11 —

allod to be raised by the full extent of the deialuation. The exchange rate
is frozen and price controls are neintained. In this case prices of
controlled products decline in terms of foreign ctu"rency. If, for exanple,

donestic inport prices and prices of nontradeables are frozen following the

deualuat ion, then p1 and

decline by the sane proportion, Iiich equals

the rate of deualuation. If only nontraded goods are under price controls,

p1 does not change ile

declines. The price of exportables is assuned

to be uncontrolled.

If inport prices are controlled, then inporters cease inporting, because

the donestic price does not couer unit costs.4 This generates an excess
demsnd for iirports and disequilibrium in the inort nerket. The forced
reduction in the price of nontradeabies generates also disequilibrium in the
market for nontraded goods, thich not.,es into a state of excess demand. If

there is no decline in desired agaregate spending, the economy experiences
forced satYings. In this case one expects to obserue shortages of the type
that appeared in Brazil after the iirplenentation of its stabilization program

4The result that ider conpetition price controls lead to the ceasation of
inports depends on the y the inporting actiuity is nDdelled. I use in the
text the standard nodelling procedure. If, houer, one assunes that
inportables haue to be con-Iined with donestic inputs in order to supply
donestic demand (as, for exanpie, in Sanyal and Jones (1982)), then price
controls only reduce inports. This can be nodelled, for exanpie, by assuming
that there are inputs specific to the inport industry, so that final output of
inportables is giuen by F 1(m), there ni is the quantity iirported and
is strictly concaue. Then inporters maximize p1f1(m) —

pm,

and a reduction

in p1 does not lead to m = 0. The nodel in the text assunes F 1(m) = m.
Obser"e, hoveuer, that our main results do not depend on the .ey inports are
being nodelled.

— 12

1986. In terms of Fig. 2 (in vtich point A describes

without

the

equilibrium

price controls), if price controls lead to the decline of the price of

nontradeables to p, then the econony ends up at point C, at vtich there
is clearing of the export irarket (vtich is not controlled) and there is excess
delTand for nontraded goods. Hence, price controls lead to a decline in the

price of exportables, but proportionately less than the price of

nontradeables. The result is that

exports

increase and

inports

decline (to

zero), bringing about an inprovenent in the trade accotmt. Naturally, the
expansion of the export industry is associated with a contraction of the
nontraded goods sector, thereby aggrauating excess denand in that narket.

It is now easy

to see that the analysis does

not

change nuch if inport

prices are not controlled. Naturally, in this case there is no excess denand
in the market for inportables, but

there

is still excess demand for

nontradeables. In terms of Fig. 2, point C still describes the new
equilibrium point. Hence, the price of exportables declines proportionately
less than the price of nontradeables, exports expand and output of

— 13 —

nontradeables contracts. The difference arises in the trade accout. Now
inports do not drop to zero. In fact, giten aggregate spending E, the

as

- E

Hence, since p and N decline, donestic product declines and there is a
deterioration in the trade accotrnt. Now w/PN increases hut w/p1

declines,

so that w/Q nay increase or decline.

Naturally,

if the initial situation is one with effective price controls,

then partial relaxation of these controls has opposite effects. These are

presented in the first row of Table 2 for the case in ttich inport prices are
also controlled (vkiich is the relevant case for Israel).

The next set of issues to be considered concerns the effects of shifts in
aggregate spending and labor stqply in the presence of price controls. First,

consider aggregate spending. If both inports and nontradeables are
controlled, then with effective price controls in place, snaIl changes in
aggregate spending do not affect prices or sectoral allocations, nor do they
affect the trade account. Rather, an increase in aggegate spending

about

larger forced savings vtile a decline in aggregate spending brings about

snaller forced savings. If, on the other hand, inport prices are not

controlled, changes in aggregate spending do not affect prices and resource

— 14 —

allocation

as ll. This tine, hoei,er, they do affect the trade account,

because all of the change in aggregate spending is reflected in inports.

Hence, an increase in aggregate spending increases inports, bringing about a
decline in the trade accotmt stu-plus.

Since (7)

is satisfied also in the

presence

of price controls1 an

increase in labor input L, ihich leads to an excess supply of exportables if
prices do not change, brings about a decline in the price of exports (in terms

of Fig. 2, the cur'e XX shifts dovxrds, and so does point C) and an
expansion of output in the exporting industry. The v.ge rate w =

HL(PX,PN;L)

declines as a result of both the increase in L and the decline in p.
Hence, the real consuvrption ge rate w/Q also declines. Therefore, output
of nontradeables rises (see (2) for i=N), thereby reducing the excess demsnd
for them. Inports do not change if inport prices are controlled and they
decline if inport prices are not controlled (due to the fact that additional

supply of nontradeables reduces the spilloer of excess denend into
inportables), thile export earnings increase. The result is an inprot.iemsnt in

the trade accouct. Natt-ally, the sane results obtain if the ge rate is
reduced and enplcyner-it is a.l1od to adjust. These results are sunrized in
the upper part of Table 2 for the case in thich inport prices are also
controlled.

expansion

of

contraction

T = p.X(p.)).

Consequently, (5) inplies

output in the nontraded goods sector, leading (uia (3))

art

to a

of the exportables sector. The contraction of exports requires a

higher export price (see (4)), leading to lor export ret.7enue. Point C' in
Fig. 2 describes the resulting price configuration. Since inports increase
;thile export rexyenue declines,

the

trade accout rsens. The effect on mages

is fotn-id by obseruing that price controls int.ialidate (2')

only, and that it

remains

for

nontradeables

ualid for exportables. Therefore, a higher price of

exportables and lor enplovnent

in

their production requires a higher wsge

rate w, and inplies a higher real consnmt ion cage w/Q.
The economic story that energes from this analysis is as follows. fn

equiproportional

reduction

of inport prices and prices of nontradeables

expands demand for inports and

it

for

nontradeables. ?tmopolistic suppliers find

profitable to supply the entire demand. Consequently, producers of

— 18 —

nontradeables

increase their deilEnd

for

labor, thereby bidding up the ;ge

rate. The ige hike increases irginal costs in the production of

nontradeables and exportables. Ho',er, as long as rginal costs of producing
the higher denwid of nontradeahies does not exceed the controlled price, the
incentive to supply the entire denerid does not change. In the export sector

increased nrginaI costs lead to 1or output and a higher price. Nattu'ally,
the export surplus declines.

These results of price controls are oust the opposite from the results
for a conpetitite economy. The irein reason for the difference is that "thile
Lulder price controls in a conpetiti.ie economy output is supply constrained, in

an oligopolistic entjironnent with price setting firms it is denend

constrained, as explained in Section 2. Since price reductions increase denand
and reduce coiietitiue supply, they are contract ionary in a conpetitive
en'ironnent and expansionary in an oligopolistic ent.iironnent. The results for

a relaxation of price controls, thich are opposite to the results of their
iirposition, are reported in the fourth row of Table 2.

How consider the results of an increase in aggregate spending in the
presence of price controls. Renener that in a conpetitit,e ent.;ironnent this

leads to only larger forced sa'ings *ien inport prices are also under control,
and to only larger inports if inport prices are riot under control. In the

current settup things differ substantially. Higher aggregate spending brings
about the expansion of the nontraded sector (see (5)) and the contraction of
the exporting sector (see (3)). Consequently, the price of exportables rises
and inport ret.ienue declines. Higher aggregate spending also increases inports,

— 19 —

so

that

the export surplus declines. The v.ge rate w rises (see (2') for

i=X), and so does the real ge rate w/Q. The sane results obtain then
iiiport prices are not controllech

Next consider an increase in labor use L vkule the price controls
remain effectitie. It is clear that in this case output of nontradeables does
not change, because it is demand determined and denand has not changed (see
(5)).

Hence, all of the additional labor is absorbed in the exporting sector

(see (3) and (4)),

bringing

about an expansion of exports and a decline of its

price. Inparts do not change. The vge rate declines, as one can see from
(2) for i=H, and so does the real ge rate w/Q. Clearly, if the source of
the disturbance is shifted from enlaynt to 'ages. then an exogeneous

decline in ges with an endogenous enp loynent ad justuent

the

will

a i so

produce

aboue described results. The results for the oligopolistic narket

structure are sunaarized in the lor part of Table 2.
It is now clear that in the presence of setveral industries, sone of thich

are conpetitiue and wiie

of

thich are oligopolistic, the net effect of price

controls will depend on the relatit.ie size of the conpetiti'e part of the

economy. In an economy with high concentration rates and a few snaIl
conpetiti,e sectors the outcone will be closer to that has been described in
this section. On the other hand, in

an economy

with a few highly concentrated

industries and nany large conpetitiue sectors the outcone will be closer to
;that has been described in the pre!iious section.

One can see in the first coltmn of the table that indeed during the third
quarter of 195 aggregate spending declined substantially, but that it began
to increase in the fourth quarter. Real ges also declined sharply in the
third quarter, remained approximately at the sane level in the fourth quarter,
and rose sharply in the

increased subsequently.

The conpetitiue as ll as the nonconpetitive rnDdel predict that a
reduction in aggregate demand without price-ge rigidities brings about an
expansion of exports, contraction of inports, and a decline in the vge rate.

If the ;•ge rate is not allod to decline by the full extent required for
full enp loynent, the enploynent level declines. Hence, one reason for the

introduction of ge controls vs to iroderate the undesirable enployirent

effects. (To other reasons re: to effect a reduction in aggregate spending

— 21 —

via

lor ges and to eliminate the inertia from the inflationary process.

See Brurio (1986) on the latter point.) Hence, the initial effects of the

program can he explained by both nodels, provided the price controls re not
effective or had only a sn 11 effect. Indeed, there are sone \tho might argue

that the initial sharp reduction of aggregate spending brought about

equilihrjthl-, prices below the inposed ceilings. It is, hover, reasonable to
argue on the basis of the intensive activity of the Ninistry of Industry and

Taking the view that price controls re effective starting at least with

shortages. Exports decline and iports increase. The price of exportables

increases and so does the ge rate that nintains a constant level of

constant euiploynent, eiiployiint increases, thereby ircderating the decline of

exports. This description is consistent with the data, provided the increase

in spending dominates the other effects (see the lor part of Table 2).

Natally, this is also consistent with the lack of shortages. The evidence
