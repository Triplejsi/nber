ABSTRACT
This paper examines a schooling expansion in Romania which increased educational attainment
for successive cohorts born between 1945 and 1950. We use a regression discontinuity design at
the day level based on school entry cutoff dates to estimate impacts on mortality with 1994-2016
Vital Statistics data and self-reported health with 2011 Census data. We find that the schooling
reform led to significant increases in years of schooling and changes in labor market outcomes
but did not affect mortality or self-reported health. These estimates provide new evidence for the
causal relationship between education and mortality outside of high-income countries and at
lower margins of educational attainment.

1. Introduction
There is substantial evidence showing that more educated people have better
health and longer life expectancies. However, whether this correlation reflects a causal
relationship remains an open question. A number of recent papers have used changes in
compulsory schooling requirements to identify the causal impact of schooling on health
and mortality in the United States (Lleras-Muney, 2005; Mazumder, 2008), the United
Kingdom (Oreopoulos, 2006; Clark and Royer, 2013), Denmark (Arendt, 2008), France
(Albouy and Lequien, 2009), the Netherlands (van Kippersluis, et al., 2011), and Sweden
(Meghir, et al., forthcoming). While this empirical approach can be compelling, the
findings have been mixed and sometimes contradictory, even when based on the same
educational expansions. Moreover, all of these studies are focused on the United States
or Western Europe where compulsory schooling laws usually affect students enrolled in
secondary school. As a result, we know relatively little about the causal effect of
education on health and mortality in developing or middle-income countries, and at
lower margins of educational attainment.
This paper examines the impact of a schooling expansion in Romania during the
late 1950s and early 1960s, which sought to provide all students with at least 7 years of
compulsory education. We show that successive cohorts of individuals, born between
1945 and 1950, who were affected by this schooling expansion, experienced rising
educational attainment. Then we use a regression discontinuity design at the day level
to compare individuals born just before the school entry cutoff of January 1 to those
born just after, who were almost identical in age but began school later and therefore
had greater opportunities to extend their education. Since students born immediately
before and after January 1 were also the oldest and youngest in their respective classes,

2

we also draw on cohorts born after the schooling expansion had concluded to separate
the effect of increased education from that of relative age and starting school younger. 1
We demonstrate that the schooling expansion led to significant increases in
years of schooling for the affected cohorts born between 1945 and 1950. This increase
in educational attainment was accompanied by significant increases in labor force
participation and decreases in fertility for women. Nevertheless, using detailed
information on deaths from Vital Statistics data between 1994 and 2016, we do not find
evidence that the schooling expansion reduced the mortality of affected cohorts up to
the age of 71. Nor are there reductions in mortality from more specific causes of death.
In addition, there are no significant effects for measures of self-reported health using
data from the 2011 Romanian Census.
Our findings indicate that more education does not help individuals avoid or
postpone deaths during middle and old age. This is consistent with the null results in
the most recent papers by Clark and Royer (2013) and Meghir et al. (forthcoming) for
the United Kingdom and Sweden. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first
paper to provide compelling estimates for the causal relationship between education
and mortality outside of high-income countries and at lower margins of educational
attainment. We do not interpret these estimates as an argument against further
educational expansions in the developing world. But they do suggest the need to be
more circumspect about the potential for such expansions to improve health and
increase life expectancy, at least at lower margins of educational attainment.

See Cascio and Schanzenbach (2016) for evidence on the impacts of relative age in Tennessee and Black,
Devereux, and Salvanes (2011) for evidence on the effect of starting school younger in Norway.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature.
Section 3 provides a background of the Romanian educational system and the
educational expansion. Section 4 describes the data and the empirical strategy. Section
5 presents the results, alternative explanations and potential mechanisms, while Section
6 concludes.

2. Related Literature
This section reviews some of the previous literature estimating the causal impact
of education on health and mortality. We begin with a more detailed discussion of the
papers that take advantage of changes in compulsory schooling requirements. Then we
describe some of the alternative empirical approaches used for identifying the causal
effect of education at higher margins of educational attainment. For more detailed
reviews of these and other studies, see Mazumder (2012) and Galama et al. (2018).
For the United States, Lleras-Muney (2005) uses Census data to examine the
impact of changes in compulsory schooling laws between 1915 and 1939 that affected
students over 14 years of age. Her instrumental variables (IV) estimates indicate that an
additional year of schooling leads to significant declines in the probability of dying in
the next 10 years. In a follow-up study, Mazumder (2008) notes that these results are
not robust to including state-specific trends but presents evidence from the Survey of
Income and Program Participation (SIPP) showing positive impacts of education on selfreported health status. Finally, Black et al. (2016) argue that virtually all of the variation
in mortality rates is captured by cohort effects and state effects, making it difficult to

4

reliably estimate the effects of changing educational attainment due to state-level
changes in compulsory schooling. 2
For the United Kingdom, Clark and Royer (2013) use changes to British
compulsory schooling laws in 1947 and 1972 that increased the minimum school
leaving age from 14 to 15 and then from 15 to 16. Their regression discontinuity (RD)
design does not provide strong evidence for an impact of education on mortality or
other health outcomes. Davies et al. (2016) re-examine the 1972 change in compulsory
schooling using UK Biobank data and find a statistically significant decline in mortality
but their results are somewhat sensitive to functional form.
Other studies are focused on European countries: For Sweden, Meghir et al.
(forthcoming) do not find improvements in mortality and other health measures for
affected cohorts following an educational reform in Sweden that raised the number of
years of compulsory schooling from 7/8 to 9, eliminated early selection based on
academic ability, and introduced a national curriculum. Arendt (2005) and Albouy and
Lequien (2009) also find no statistically significant impact of compulsory school
reforms on health outcomes in Denmark and France, respectively. Yet van Kippersluis et
al. (2011) do find that increasing compulsory school beyond grade 6 in the Netherlands
leads to significant reduction in mortality in old age.
Finally, a different set of studies use draft avoidance behavior in the United
States during the Vietnam War to estimate the impact of college education on mortality
and health outcomes. Buckles et al. (2016) show that the increased college going among
men in cohorts associated with greater draft avoidance also leads to lower mortality in

In a paper that considers the effect of school quality on health, Aaronson et al. (2017) find that
childhood exposure to Rosenwald schools in the Jim Crow south increased life expectancy, after
accounting for the negative effects of migration.

subsequent years. Grimard and Parent (2007) and de Walque (2007) use a similar
identification strategy to estimate impacts on smoking behavior and find evidence
suggesting that more education reduces the take-up of smoking and current smoking.
However, the estimates in these papers are based on changes at the margin of college
education, which may differ from changes due to compulsory schooling laws.
In our own review of the literature, and in those by Mazumder (2012) and
Galama et al. (2018), we have not found any papers that provide compelling causal
estimates for the impact of education on health or mortality in low and middle-income
countries.

3. Background on Education in Romania
During the post-war period, the structure and the organization of education in
Romania was largely based on the model in the Soviet Union as codified by Decree No.
175 of 1948 (Braham, 1972). 3 There were several different types of schools. First, there
were 4-year primary schools that offered grades 1 through 4 and were often located in
rural areas. Second, there were 7-year general schools, called gymnasiums, which
offered grades 1 through 7 (and later expanded to grade 8), with the first four years
covering similar material as in the 4- year primary schools. Third, there were 11-year
schools, which offered grades 1 through 11 in one school that provided both primary
and secondary education.
After a successful campaign to provide basic literacy education targeted towards
all ages in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the government focused its attention on
increasing enrollment beyond the first four grades. According to Giurescu et al. (1971, p.

3

This section relies heavily on information provided in Barham (1963, 1972).

6

351), the five year plan of 1955-1960 specified that the extension of compulsory
schooling to 7 years was to be given special attention by the party and government.
Thus, the directives of the Communist Party’s Second Congress of 1955 which outlined
the second five year plan, envisioned a “situation under which, by 1960-1961, the fifth
grade would enroll 90 percent of the 4-year school graduates, and under which,
according to the Third Five Year plan, the 7-year school would be universal and
compulsory. At first only the first four grades were made compulsory, but villages and
rural communities having 7-year schools were required by virtue of Decision No.
1035/1958 to make the 7 year schooling period universal beginning with the 19581959 academic year” (Braham, 1963).
Nevertheless, this process was not immediate and was constrained by a lack of
enough schools offering 7 years of compulsory schooling: “Since this governmental
action applied only to places where 7-year schools already existed, it appears that the
extension of free compulsory education is to a large extent only nominal. Furthermore,
with rural communities retaining the 4-year compulsory level, the lack of detailed
planning to elevate their schools to the 7-year compulsory level has left an irregular
pattern of schooling in the provinces” (Braham, 1963). Filipescu and Oprea (1972) also
confirm the gradual process of expanding education at the gymnasium level. They
explain that the expansion of 7-year compulsory education began in 1956 within towns
and larger villages that already had schools beyond the 4th grade, and that it gradually
expanded until it was close to universal by 1961-1962.
We can document some of these changes using aggregate data on enrollment
from the Annual Statistics of the Socialist Republic of Romania. Figure 1 shows the large
increase in the number of students graduating from gymnasium between 1955 and
1965. During this period, graduation from gymnasiums increased sharply from 116,698
7

in 1959 to 329,739 in 1963 and stayed at similar levels through the late 1960s and early
1970s.
Further evidence for these dramatic changes can be observed at the cohort level.
By law, students entered grade 1 in September of the year following the calendar year in
which they reached 6 years of age. Thus, the cohort born in 1945 was 6 years of age in
1951, entered first grade in the fall of 1952, entered fifth grade in the fall of 1956 and
would have graduated with 7 years of schooling in the spring of 1959. This cohort
should be the first cohort that could have been affected by the policy reform. Similarly,
the cohort born in 1947 was the first cohort to have potentially benefited from the 1958
Government Decision that made 7-year of schooling compulsory. Finally, the cohort that
entered fifth grade in 1961-1962, which according to Filipescu and Oprea (1972) is the
first cohort to have achieved universal 7 year compulsory education, was born in 1950.
Figure 2 shows the highest educational attainment by year of birth for cohorts of
individuals in the Romanian Census of 1992. There is a sharp decline in the proportion
of individuals with primary education between cohorts born in 1944 and 1950. At the
same time, we observe a sharp increase in the proportion of individuals who complete
secondary education (which includes graduates of gymnasiums). Note that cohorts born
between 1935 and 1944 also experienced large increases in educational attainment.
This is mainly driven by the early literacy and education campaigns introduced after the
Communist government came to power.
In Figure 3 we plot the “residual” percent of individuals born between 1943 and
1955 who completed primary education by their month of birth, after accounting for
calendar month of birth effects. A number of interesting patterns emerge from this
graph. First, and consistent with the results in Figure 2, we observe the large decrease
in the proportion of students who have only primary education for those born between
8

1945 and 1950. Secondly, and more importantly for our empirical strategy, the
decreases in percent of students with only primary education occur discontinuously,
with disproportionately large decreases for those born after January 1st in this period.
The discontinuities are especially visible for those born around January 1st of 1945,
1947, 1948 and 1949 and to a smaller extent for those born around January 1st of 1946
and 1950. At the same time, no similar discontinuities are visible for the control cohorts
born between 1950 and 1953. The patterns in Figure 3 suggest that we can use detailed
information on date of birth to estimate the impact of these educational expansions
using a regression discontinuity design.
To summarize, the evidence on graduation rates from gymnasiums in the
aggregate data coincides with the cohort analysis of educational attainment in the 1992
Census; and both are broadly consistent with the historical record of educational
reforms in Romania. Together, they indicate that education levels past the first 4 years
of primary schooling started to expand in the 1956-1957 school-year and by 19611962, enrollment in the 5th grade was essentially universal. In other words, the
expansion affected cohorts born starting in 1945 and universal gymnasium education
was essentially completed for cohorts born in or after 1950.

4. Data and Empirical Strategy
4.1 Data
Our main sample consists of individuals born in Romania between 1944 and 1952.
Those born from 1945-1949 were enrolled in the affected grades during the period of
schooling expansion while those born from 1950-1952 were enrolled after the

9

expansions had already been completed. 4 We put together information on these cohorts
from several different datasets.
We use the 1992 Romanian Census, when individuals were 40 to 48 years of age,
to estimate the impact of the schooling reform on educational attainment; certain labor
market outcomes, and conduct specification checks of our empirical strategy. 5 Two
features make this dataset especially useful for our analysis: First, with 35,000 to
45,000 observations in each yearly birth cohort, we have sufficient power to employ a
regression discontinuity design. Second, there is detailed information about the day,
month, and year of birth so we can identify the discontinuity induced by the policy
within a narrow window.
The 1992 Census provides detailed information about the highest level of
educational attainment for each respondent according to the following categories: none,
primary, gymnasium, secondary education, post-secondary, and university education.
For simplicity, we impute years of schooling by assigning the number of years
associated with each level of education. 6 This serves as our main summary measure of
education when estimating the impact of the schooling expansion. The Census also has
information on socio-economic characteristics of our respondents, such as gender,
ethnicity, and region of birth. We use these variables to validate our research design.
Finally, it contains information on labor force participation and occupational status (for

We use the three subsequent cohorts born immediately after the end of the schooling expansion as our
preferred comparison group both because they are most similar in age to the cohorts affected by the
schooling expansion and offer sufficiently large samples. However, our results are essentially unchanged
when we use four, five, or six subsequent cohorts as our comparison group.
5 This is a 15% random sample taken from the full Romanian Census by the Population Activities Unit
(PAU) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).
6 We also use data collected by the Romanian National Statistics Institute in 1995 and 1996 with reports
of actual years of schooling (rather than educational attainment) in order to validate our imputed
measure of years of schooling. These data come from surveys based on the 1994 World Bank’s Living
Standards Measurement Studies (LSMS) for Romania.

those employed) as well as the fertility of women, which serve as useful auxiliary
outcomes.
Panel A of Table 1 presents summary statistics for the individuals in cohorts
born between 1944 and 1952. The average age at the time of the 1992 census is 42.2
years and the fraction of female respondents is almost exactly half. Almost 90 percent of
the sample is ethnic Romanian, with about 7 percent ethnic Hungarians, and about 1.5
percent are Roma. The average imputed years of schooling in our sample is 9.58 years.
We use the 1994-2016 Vital Statistics Mortality files (VSM) to estimate the impact
of the schooling expansion on mortality. These data cover the universe of deceased
persons in Romania with detailed information about their socio-economic
characteristics, including the day of birth/death and the main cause of death. Thus, we
can observe mortality for the cohorts used in our analysis between the ages of 42 and 71
by day and year of birth. 7 We compute mortality for the cohorts born between 1944 and
1952 by dividing the total deaths of these cohorts during the period 1994-2016 to the
population at risk defined here as the 1944-1952 cohorts (alive) at the 1992 census. 8
Our calculation of the mortality rate may differ from the true mortality because of
migration in and out of Romania. The number of immigrants (for the cohorts we study
here) is close to zero and should not affect our results. Moreover, the VSM files include all
people deceased abroad as long as they still have a Romanian residence and/or
citizenship. Therefore, our mortality files should account for the majority of the
Romanian migrants abroad who are temporary emigrants and do not change their

Lleras-Muney (2005) and Clark and Royer (2013) suggest that the largest effects of education on
mortality occur before the age of 64. Life expectancy in Romania was 69.5 years in 1994, 74.2 in 2011,
and 75.5 years in 2016.
8 We use sample weights to calculate the total population because we only have a 15% census sample.

11

permanent residence. 9 But we also directly examine the potential for bias due to
migration by checking whether schooling expansion affects the probably of migration.
The VSM file provides detailed information on the main cause of death so we are
able to look separately at deaths associated with circulatory diseases and cancer. These
are the two most important causes of death in Romania, accounting for 44.6% and 26.5%
respectively of all deaths. Similar to Meghir et al. (2017) we also reclassify diseases
according to the epidemiological literature as preventable and treatable; preventable
causes of death may reflect health behaviors while the treatable causes of death may be
related to access to healthcare. 10
Panel B of Table 1 shows the overall mortality rate and the mortality rate by
category for our main sample. Approximately 26 percent of our sample died between
1994-2016. The largest category of deaths was due to circulatory diseases which account
for 10.5 percentage points, followed by cancer and preventable deaths, at 47.7 and 5.9
percentage points respectively. Treatable diseases only accounted for 3.9 percentage
points.
Finally, we use the 2011 Romanian Census to compute a self-reported measure of
health, which provides the impact of the schooling expansion on individuals who
survived until 2011. All respondents are asked whether they have any health related
problems that may affect their daily life at work, school, at home, etc. Approximately 7.6
percent of people in our cohorts of interest reported having such problems. Those who
answered affirmatively were given a set of six follow-up questions – whether they were
(i) visually, (ii) hearing, or (iii) movement impaired, (iv) whether they had any memory

According to Statistics Romania these emigrants are the vast majority (over the 95%) of emigrants.
We use the ICD 10 codes for defining cancer, circulatory diseases and treatable and preventable causes
of death. See the Notes at the end of the tables for more information.

peers.

4.2 Empirical Strategy
As described earlier, the schooling expansions in Romania occurred over a five
year period from 1956 to 1961 and affected born between 1945 and 1950. Since the
government rapidly expanded access to schooling during this period, a child born just
after January 1 would have benefited from the additional schools slots created by the
government over the course of a year, as compared to a child born just before January 1
who would have been part of an earlier cohort. Indeed, the discontinuities in the
fraction of individuals whose highest level of education was primary school were clearly
visible in Figure 3 for the years 1945, 1947, 1948 and 1949. In this section, we estimate
these discontinuities more formally using a regression discontinuity (RD) design.
We estimate the differences across successive cohorts during the period of
educational expansion (i.e. in the “treatment years” of 1945-1950) using the following
equation:
𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽 ′ 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 + 𝛼𝛼𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 + 𝑓𝑓(𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 ) + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖

(1)

where 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 is an outcome such as education or mortality for individual 𝑖𝑖, 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 is a set of
control variables, 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 is an indicator for individuals born just after the school entry
cutoff of January 1, and 𝑓𝑓(𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 ) is a parametric or non-parametric function of the day of
birth which serves as our running variable. For simplicity, our preferred specifications
do not include any control variables except for a constant, although including them does
not affect our results. The coefficient on 𝛼𝛼 is an estimate for the effect of being born just
after the school entry cutoff on the relevant outcome. When the outcome is a measure of

13

education, such as years of schooling, it represents a “first stage” estimate; when the
outcome is a measure of health, such as mortality, it represents the “reduced-form”
estimate.
If we assume that the exclusion restriction holds (i.e. that being born after the
school entry cutoff affects mortality only through years of schooling), the ratio of the
reduced-form and first stage coefficients represents an estimate for the impact of
education on mortality. However, the exclusion restriction may not hold since those
individuals born just after the school entry cutoff are generally the oldest children in
their class; that is, if relative age has an independent effect on health or mortality.
In order to account for any independent effect of relative age, we also compare
individuals who were born just before and after the school entry cutoff in a period
without educational expansion (i.e. in the “control years” of 1950-1953). We do this by
estimating a regression equation similar to equation (1) above using this set of control
years. But we also estimate the following models that directly compare the impact of
being born just after the school entry cutoff in treatment years to control years:
𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽 ′ 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 + 𝛼𝛼𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 + 𝑓𝑓(𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 ) + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖

(2)

where 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 is an indicator for individuals born during years of educational
expansion 1945-1950, and the other variables are defined as before (with some abuse
of notation). In this specification, the coefficient on the interaction term, 𝛿𝛿, yields the
impact of being born just after the school entry cutoff during treatment years over and
above the effect in control years that did not experience educational expansions.
A key consideration when implementing a regression discontinuity design is the
functional form of the forcing variable, 𝑓𝑓(𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 ). We present estimates using a local
linear regression as suggested by Hahn, Todd, and van der Klaauw (2001). The choice of

14

the window is somewhat arbitrary as we need to strike a balance between the
advantages of having more precise estimates with larger windows and mitigating the
possibility of confounding time effects with more narrow windows. Therefore, for our
main tables we present specifications using a 180, 120, 90, 60 and 30 day intervals, as
well as the Imbens-Kalyanarman (IK) optimal bandwidth (Imbens and Kalyanarman,
2012). We also confirm that our results are robust to using parametric specifications
that include higher order polynomials such as linear, quadratic and cubic trends in day
of birth (results available by request). All regressions cluster on day of birth in order to
avoid the problems associated with specification error in the case of discrete covariates
(Lee and Card, 2008).
A common specification check for the regression discontinuity design is to verify
that the density of observations is continuous around the cutoff (McCrary, 2008). When
we examine the density, we find substantial heaping on January 1 and on some of the
days immediately preceding it. 11 We believe that this heaping is due to delays in the
reporting of births that occurred during the holiday period between Christmas and New
Year’s Day when government offices were closed. 12
Insofar as this type of heaping is similar for our “treatment” and “control” years,
we can account for this issue in the regression that uses both sets of years. However, we
also attempt to deal with this issue using a “donut-RD” design as suggested by Barreca,
Lindo, Waddel (2016). In particular, we present all of our results when dropping
individuals born within 7 days of January 1 in order to be symmetric around the cutoff.
Results are qualitatively similar when we exclude individuals born more than one week

These density tests are shown in Appendix Table 1 and Appendix Figure 1. They are structured in a
similar fashion to the main tables as described in the results section.
12 Indeed, it appears the spike in observations occurs on January 2 in years when January 1 is a Sunday.

5. Results
5.1 Effects on educational attainment
We begin by estimating the impact of the schooling expansion on years of completed
schooling based on the level of education recorded in the 1992 Census. These “first
stage” results are shown in Table 2 which has three panels: Panel A presents estimates
for 𝛼𝛼 from equation (1) using the treatment years, 1945-1950; Panel B presents
estimates for 𝛼𝛼 from equation (1) using the control years, 1950-1953; Panel C presents
estimates for 𝛼𝛼 and 𝛿𝛿 from our preferred specification (2) which includes both
treatment and control years. Columns (1) to (6) in each panel show estimates for
alternative bandwidths. These include 180, 120, 90, 60 and 30 days of the January 1
cutoff, as well as the optimal bandwidth proposed in Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012).
Columns (7) to (12) show analogous specifications that exclude observations within 7
days of the January 1 cutoff (i.e. 7 day donut-RD regressions).
Panel A of Table 2 indicates that each successive cohort during the school
expansion period 1945-1950 received an additional 1/5 to 3/5 years of schooling; the
point estimates for the impact of being born just after vs. just before the January 1 cutoff
in the treatment years range from 0.21 to 0.67 years of schooling using our different
bandwidths. In contrast, the estimates in Panel B showing the impact of being born just
after vs. just before January 1 in the control years of 1950-1953 are small and

13 We also verify that our available covariates vary smoothly around the discontinuity in Appendix Tables
2 and 3. With a few exceptions, the coefficients are mostly small and insignificant.

16

statistically insignificant in all specifications. Panel C shows estimates from the
specification that combines both treatment and control years. In these specifications,
the impact of the school expansion is captured by 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 and shows impacts
of 0.23 to 0.59 years of schooling, all highly significant. The results using the donut
specifications are about 30% smaller in magnitude but still statistically significant in all
specifications. 14 The range of these estimate is not altogether surprising given the large
number of different specifications that we consider. However, we take our preferred
specification to be the IK bandwidth for the full sample, implying a first stage effect of
approximately a 1/2 year of schooling.
We also present our “first stage” results graphically in Figure 4. Panels A, C and E
plot average years of schooling by day of birth for individuals born six months before
and after January 1st of each year; panels B, D and F plot the same data by week of birth,
which often makes it easier to discern the patterns. The graphs are normalized so that
day 1 corresponds to January 1 and week 1 corresponds to the week of January 1 to
January 7. The fitted lines are based on smoothed local linear regressions using the IK
bandwidth.
Panels A and B show a clear discontinuity after January 1 for the treatment years
of 1945-1950. This visual evidence confirms that individuals born merely a couple of
days apart received a substantially different amount of schooling as a result of the
school expansion. In contrast, panels C and D of Figure 4 reveal no change in average
educational attainment before and after January 1st in the control cohort. Nevertheless,
each of the first four panels in Figure 4 show some time trends, consistent with the

Appendix Table 4 uses the 1994-1996 LSMS datasets to estimate the impact of the schooling expansion
on reported years of schooling rather than an imputed measure based on completed educational levels.
The results are somewhat less precise but generally similar to those in Table 4.

presence of seasonality in the timing of births. Such time effects are not visible in Panels
E and F of Figure 4, which use both treatment and control years to estimate a version of
equation (2) that differences out the impacts in the control years from those in the
treatment years.

5.2 Effects on mortality and self-reported health
In this section we analyze whether, in addition to affecting education, the school
expansion policy had an impact on mortality and health. We begin by using the Vital
Statistics data from 1994 to 2016 to examine mortality. Table 3, which has the same
structure as the previous tables, reveals no evidence of a statistically significant effect of
being born just after vs. just before the January 1 cutoff on mortality in the treatment
years of 1945-1950 (in Panel A) or in the control years of 1950-1953 (in Panel B),
except for the smallest bandwidths. Furthermore, all of the significant effects disappear
once we consider the donut regression that excludes individuals born 7 days before and
after January 1.
We see a couple of marginally significant effects on 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 in Panel C
that includes both treatment and control years, although these have positive signs. Still,
with 10 out of the 12 point estimates from our preferred specification in Panel C not
showing any statistically significant effect, we conclude that there is no evidence for an
impact of the schooling expansion on mortality. Given the standard errors for our full
sample, we can rule out with 95% confidence that the schooling expansions reduced
mortality by more than 0.8 percentage points between 1994-2016 when the average
mortality rate was 26 percent.
A graphical analysis of the mortality results is presented in Figure 5, structured
similarly to the preceding figures. The patterns in Panels A-F provide a visual
18

interpretation of the regression estimates from Table 3. We do not see evidence for
large discontinuities in the mortality rate between 1994 and 2016 and, if anything, they
point against the finding that education reduces mortality.
We also consider the effect of the schooling expansion on specific causes of
death. We first focus on mortality from the two most common causes of death in
Romania: cancer and circulatory diseases. The regression estimates for these causes of
death are shown in Tables 4 and 5 respectively, while the figures are shown in
Appendix Figure 2 and 3 respectively. We also classify certain causes of death as
preventable or treatable, similar to Meghir et al. (2017). The regression estimates for
these causes of death are shown in Appendix Table 5 and 6 respectively. In none of the
tables do we observe evidence for a consistent effect of the schooling expansion on
mortality. Similarly, none of the corresponding graphs show visible discontinuities
around the regression discontinuity cutoffs. Thus, we do not find any more evidence for
the impact of the schooling expansion on specific causes of death than on the mortality
rate as a whole.
In addition to the impact of the schooling expansion on mortality, we also
examine its effect on self-reported health using the 2011 Romanian Census. This is
shown in Table 6 and Appendix Figure 4, which are again structured in a similar fashion
to the previous tables and figures. Overall, we do not find an impact of the schooling
expansion on self-reported health among individuals who survived until 2011. It is
worth noting that, since we have access to the full 100% sample of the 2011 Census,
these results are estimated with substantial precision. Given our standard errors for the
full sample, we can rule out with 95% confidence that the schooling expansions reduced
the fraction of people with health related problems by 0.06 percent, which corresponds
to 0.023 standard deviation units. We have also explored the specific dimensions of
19

health used to create our self-reported health index (i.e. vision, hearing, impaired
movement, memory, self-care and communication) and did not find any meaningful
impacts for these specific categories.

5.3 Alternative explanations
5.3.1 Quality of education
Despite the clear impacts of the schooling reform on educational attainment, one
might question the quality of this education (especially in light of the rapid expansion of
education during these early years) and ask whether the expansion also had an impact
on other important outcomes.
Table 7 presents estimates for the impact of the schooling expansions on labor
force participation, measured as an indicator for being employed at the time of the 1992
Census. 15 This table is structured similarly to the other tables, with Panels A, B, and C
showing impacts for the treatment years, control years, and all the years together. The
impact of the schooling expansion is most clearly visible in Panel A of Table 7 which
shows that individuals entering school in successive cohorts are 1.2 to 1.6 percent more
likely to be employed. 16 These impacts are less robust in Panel C and in the donut
regressions, but the patterns are largely consistent. A graphical depiction of these
impacts can be seen in Panels A, B, E and F of Appendix Figure 5.
We also observe significant impacts of Romania’s schooling expansion on
fertility, as shown in Appendix Table 7. Our preferred estimates reported in Panel C
using the full sample of women show that exposure to the expansion decreased fertility

Unfortunately, the 1992 Census does not contain any information about earnings or income.
We also found impacts on occupational composition, such as the likelihood of working in a manual
occupation or the skill level associated with one’s occupation. These are available by request.

15
16

20

by 0.08 and 0.29 children. To summarize, these labor market and fertility effects suggest
that the educational expansion had an impact on a range of socio-economic outcomes.

5.3.2 Migration
To address concerns about bias due to migration, we consider whether our school
expansion directly affected the probability of external migration. The 2011 census
contains information on all persons who migrated abroad for a period of at least 12
months (at the time of the census). So the vast majority of the Romanian emigrants are
covered; i.e., all individuals working abroad who maintain their houses, identity cards
or/and remain registered by the Romanian administrative bodies. 17 Using a similar
strategy as before, we show in Appendix Table 8 that there is no impact of the schooling
expansion on the likelihood of the individuals (who survived until 2011) to emigrate.
The migration results presented above, while reassuring, are not able to capture
any possible effects of the schooling expansion on permanent migration. We address
this possibility through an indirect test. Using information from the 1992 and 2011
census samples, we calculate the (weighted) number of people born in a given day who
are in the 2011 census as a (weighted) fraction of the number in the 1992 census. This
ratio should capture a combination of both mortality and migration between 19922011. These results are presented in Appendix Table 9, and confirm that there is no
impact of the school expansion on this combined measure of mortality and migration.

According to Statistics Romania, about 95% of the Romanian emigrants are temporary migrants,
meaning that they keep their Romanian ID’s. Moreover, the death of these individuals is reported in the
Romanian Mortality Files. While permanent migrants who do not remain registered by the Romanian
administrative bodies are not covered, we believe this is a second-order issue because these are mostly
highly educated migrants (university or more) who, most likely, were not affected by our policy.

5.4 Mechanisms
Our findings indicate that the Romanian schooling expansion did not improve health or
reduce mortality. In this section, we attempt to explore some of the mechanisms
underlying these findings. However, insofar as education can impact health and
mortality through many different channels, our discussion remains largely speculative.
First, more education may lead to higher income and perhaps better health care.
While Romania has universal access to the public healthcare system independently of the
individual income, financial resources may still be important because of informal
payments (i.e. bribes). Our main results did suggest that the schooling expansion led to
greater labor market opportunities (e.g. higher employment) but the Census data did not
include information on income. In Appendix Table 10, we use the LSMS survey to examine
whether the impact of the school expansion affected income and found positive but
insignificant effects. Note that, using the LSMS data, we find positive and significant
impacts of the schooling expansion on employment, similar to the results using Census
data. 18
Second, even if more education would lead to higher incomes, the impact of
income on health is not obvious. Income could allow individuals to access better health
care, but it may also lead to an increased consumption of unhealthy goods, such as alcohol
and cigarettes. This seems to be the case in Romania where, using the Romanian
Household Budget Survey, we find positive and significant correlations between

Education could also affect mortality through changes in the occupation structure. Indeed, we observe
some evidence that Romania’s schooling expansion, shifted individuals out of manual jobs and farming
and into technicians and professional jobs. However, whether these changes should have led to improved
health is not completely clear if more education enables individuals to find work in more skilled
occupations, with better working conditions, we might expect to find positive health impacts. However,
some skilled occupations may be associated with more stress than certain less skilled occupations.
Moreover, it is possible that some relatively skilled manufacturing jobs may have worse working
conditions than jobs in the informal sector such as agriculture.

18

education and smoking. However, when we attempted to estimate our regression
discontinuity specifications using this data, we find no significant effects of education on
smoking behavior (see Appendix Table 11). 19 Using the same data, we also find no effects
on the likelihood of having a chronic condition. 20
Thus, our analysis does not yield any strong conclusions about the role of
particular mechanisms in explaining our results. 21 However, these results need to be
interpreted with care since they are mostly based on imprecise estimates using small
auxiliary datasets.

6. Conclusion
This paper analyzes a schooling expansion in Romania, which aimed to ensure that all
students received at least 7 years of compulsory schooling. The schooling expansion
affected five consecutive cohorts born between 1945-1950 and we use a regression
discontinuity (RD) design to estimate impacts by comparing the differences across
successive cohorts of affected students. We find that beginning school in a (one year)
later cohort increases educational attainment by approximately a 1/2 year of schooling.
We do not find any consistent significant impacts of the schooling reform on selfreported health or mortality. Moreover, we can rule out that the schooling expansions
reduced mortality by more than 0.08 percentage points between 1994 and 2016 or that

Specifically, we use the 2001-2009 Romanian Household Budget Survey (RHBS) which is a national
representative survey, covering about 30,000 households each year and contains detailed socio-economic
information on all household members. Note that the RHBS data does not have the day of birth, but only
the month and year and therefore we cannot show the donuts specifications.
20 The RHBS data also showed no effect on the likelihood of being hospitalized or on the number of days
hospitalized during the last 30 days (results available by request).
21 Given the findings in Aaronson et al. (2017), we also examined the role of internal migration. However,
we did not find significant effects of the schooling expansion on internal migration, measured as an
indicator for whether the person lives in the locality of birth in 2011 (results available upon request).
19

23

they improved self-reported health by more than 0.02 standard deviation units for the
full sample of individuals in the affected cohorts.
Whether education causally affects health and mortality is an important question
for both developed and developing countries alike. However, most of the previous work
has focused on the United States and Western Europe. The findings in this literature are
mixed and there is not strong evidence that education significantly improves health or
decreases mortality. We extend the literature by estimating causal impacts for a
population that is substantially poorer and also experienced changes at a lower margin
of educational attainment. However, our findings only serve to reinforce the absence of
a causal effect of education health and mortality, even in this setting. While we have
attempted to examine the underlying mechanisms for these findings, more work needs
to be done to better understand why we do not observe a strong relationship between
education and health across a variety of different settings.
