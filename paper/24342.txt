The New Fama Puzzle

ABSTRACT
We re-examine the Fama (1984) puzzle – the finding that ex post depreciation and interest
differentials are negatively correlated, contrary to what theory suggests – for eight advanced
country exchange rates against the US dollar, over the period up to June 2019. The rejection of
the joint hypothesis of uncovered interest parity (UIP) and rational expectations – sometimes
called the unbiasedness hypothesis – still occurs, but with much less frequency. Strikingly, in
contrast to earlier findings, the Fama regression coefficient is positive and large in the period
after the global financial crisis. However, using survey based measures of exchange rate
expectations, we find much greater evidence in favor of UIP. Hence, the main story for the switch
in Fama coefficients in the wake of the global financial crisis is mostly – but not entirely – a
change in how expectations errors and interest differentials co-move. The durability of this
phenomenon depends on the persistence in patterns in expectations errors, and the variability of
those errors as well as of interest differentials.

1. Introduction
Uncovered interest parity – the proposition that anticipated exchange rate changes should
offset interest rate differentials – is one of the most central concepts in international
finance. At the same time, empirical validation of this concept has proven elusive. In fact,
the failure of the joint hypothesis of uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) and rational
expectations – sometimes termed the unbiasedness hypothesis – is one of the most robust
empirical regularities in the literature. The most commonplace explanations – such as the
existence of an exchange risk premium, which drives a wedge between forward rates and
expected future spot rates – have little empirical verification. 1
Several developments have prompted this revisit. First and foremost, the last
decade includes a period in which short rates have effectively hit the zero interest rate
bound. This point is clearly illustrated in Figure 1 where we plot one-year interest rates
for a set of eight selected countries and the United States. This development affords us
the opportunity to examine whether the Fama puzzle is a general phenomenon or one that
is regime-dependent. Indeed, the jury is still out about the impact of the zero lower bound
on the relationship between interest rate differentials and exchange rates, for example
Fernald et al. (2017) find no clear evidence that the US dollar has become more sensitive
since 2014. Second, we now have more indicators for risk aversion for extended periods
of time. This potentially allows us to distinguish between competing explanations for the

Engel (1996) surveys the failure of the portfolio balance models and consumption capital asset pricing
models. See also Chinn (2006) and more recently Engel (2014).

failure of the unbiasedness hypothesis. Specifically, we can examine whether the
inclusion of these risk proxies alters the Fama puzzle. 2
To anticipate our results, we obtain the following findings. First, Fama’s (1984)
finding that interest rate differentials point in the wrong direction for subsequent ex-post
changes in exchange rates is by and large replicated in regressions for the full sample,
ranging from January 1999 to June 2018. However, the results change if the sample is
truncated to apply to only the most recent decade, the period for which interest rates are
essentially close to zero. For that period, interest differentials correctly signal the right
direction of subsequent exchange rate changes, but with a magnitude that is altogether not
reconcilable with the arbitrage interpretation of UIP. In other words, we obtain positive
coefficients at exactly a time of high risk when it would seem less likely that UIP would
hold.
We also find that the inclusion of a proxy variable for risk, namely the VIX,
results in Fama regression coefficients that are overall similar to those obtained without
accounting for risk aversion. This finding suggests that changes in the elevation of risk as
measured by the VIX do not explain the Fama puzzle, at least not in a direct linear
fashion.
The use of expectations data provides the following insights. First, interest
differentials and anticipated exchange rate changes are overall positively correlated,
consistent with the proposition that investors tend to equalize, at least partially, returns
expressed in common currency terms. Second, in cases where the Fama coefficient
The question of exchange rate developments in light of interest rate differentials is obviously important
for policy makers in general (and central bankers in particular, see for instance Coeuré, 2017).

switches sign from negative to positive from pre- to post-crisis, the result arises because
the correlation of expectations errors and interest differentials changes substantially.
Hence, exchange risk does not appear to be the primary reason why the Fama coefficient
has been so large in recent years (although the altered behaviour of exchange risk does
play a role).
In the next section we briefly lay out the theory underlying the UIP and Fama
regressions, and review the existing literature. In Section 3, we examine the empirical
results obtained from estimating the Fama regression. In Section 4 we explore the results
dropping the rational expectations assumption. Section 5 presents a decomposition of the
components driving the deviation of the Fama coefficient from the posited value of unity.
Section 6 concludes.
2. Theory and Literature
One of the building blocks of international finance, the concept of uncovered interest
parity (UIP) is incorporated into almost all theoretical models. UIP is a no arbitrage
profits condition:
(1)

∗
𝐸𝐸𝑡𝑡𝑀𝑀 [𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡+ℎ − 𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡 ] = (𝑖𝑖ℎ,𝑡𝑡 − 𝑖𝑖ℎ,𝑡𝑡
)

where 𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡+ℎ − 𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡 is the depreciation of the reference currency with respect to the foreign

∗
currency from time 𝑡𝑡 to time 𝑡𝑡 + ℎ, 𝑖𝑖ℎ,𝑡𝑡 and 𝑖𝑖ℎ,𝑡𝑡
are the interest rates of horizon ℎ at

time 𝑡𝑡 of the reference and the foreign country, respectively. 𝐸𝐸𝑡𝑡𝑀𝑀 denotes the market’s
expectation based on time 𝑡𝑡 information. To fix ideas and to anticipate on the empirical
∗
results, let 𝑖𝑖ℎ,𝑡𝑡 represent the US interest rate, 𝑖𝑖ℎ,𝑡𝑡
the foreign interest rate (that of the UK,

euro area, Japan, etc), and s𝑡𝑡 the number of US dollars per foreign currency unit, such
3

that an increase in s𝑡𝑡 is a depreciation of the dollar. If the US interest rate, for any

maturity h, is above Japan’s interest rate, i.e. 𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 > 𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡∗ , then we should expect the dollar to

depreciate at horizon h.

In other words, the market’s expectation of returns is equalized in common
currency terms, so that excess returns are not anticipated ex ante. In practice, the most
common way in which testing the validity of UIP has been implemented is by way of the
Fama regression (Fama, 1984): 3
(2)

∗
� + 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡+ℎ
𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡+ℎ − 𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽�𝑖𝑖ℎ,𝑡𝑡 − 𝑖𝑖ℎ,𝑡𝑡

The OLS regression coefficient β is given by the following expression:
(3)

∗

𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑖𝑖ℎ,𝑡𝑡 −𝑖𝑖ℎ,𝑡𝑡 ,𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡+ℎ −𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡 )
𝛽𝛽̂ =
−𝑖𝑖 ∗ )
𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉(𝑖𝑖ℎ,𝑡𝑡

ℎ,𝑡𝑡

Under the joint null hypothesis of uncovered interest parity and rational
expectations, 𝛽𝛽 = 1, and the regression residual is a true random error term, orthogonal

to the interest differential. Note that the intercept 𝛼𝛼 may be non-zero while testing for
UIP using equation (2). A non-zero α may reflect a constant risk premium (hence, tests

for β = 1 are tests for a time-varying risk premium, rather than risk neutrality per se)
and/or approximation errors stemming from Jensen’s Inequality and from the fact that
expectation of a ratio (the exchange rate) is not equal to the ratio of the expectation.

For ease of exposition, log approximations are used. In the empirical implementation, exact formulas are
used. We have examined data at three month and one year horizons (h ∈ [3,12]), using monthly data. This
means the regression residuals are serially correlated under the null hypothesis of rational expectations and
uncovered interest parity. We account for this issue by using robust standard errors. We report results for
h=12, in order to conserve space; h=3 results are reported in the Appendix Tables 2-4.

In order to understand the surprising nature of the results for empirical tests of
uncovered interest parity, it is helpful to clarify what is to be expected from a Fama
regression by isolating the key assumptions necessary to go from equation (1) to
regression equation (2). There are three key assumptions for obtaining (2) from (1), as
laid out in the following equations:
(4)
(5)
(6)

𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐

∗
𝑓𝑓ℎ,𝑡𝑡 − 𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡 = �𝑖𝑖ℎ,𝑡𝑡 − 𝑖𝑖ℎ,𝑡𝑡
� − 𝜖𝜖ℎ,𝑡𝑡

𝑓𝑓ℎ,𝑡𝑡 = 𝐸𝐸𝑡𝑡𝑀𝑀 [𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡+ℎ ] + 𝜖𝜖ℎ,𝑡𝑡

𝑓𝑓

𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡+ℎ = 𝐸𝐸𝑡𝑡𝑀𝑀 [𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡+ℎ ] − 𝜖𝜖𝑡𝑡+ℎ
𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐

When 𝜖𝜖ℎ,𝑡𝑡 is zero, then equation (4) indicates that there are no barriers to arbitrage using
the forward rate 𝑓𝑓ℎ,𝑡𝑡 (of horizon h, at time t). In other words, covered interest parity holds,

or equivalently, the covered interest differential is zero. This condition applies when
capital controls are not relevant, and there are no regulatory or funding constraints. 4 For
currency pairs of advanced economies, and for offshore yields, 5 covered interest parity
has held up, up until the global financial crisis. Equation (5) indicates that the forward
rate is equal to the market’s expectation of the future spot rate up to an exchange risk
𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟

premium term, 𝜖𝜖ℎ,𝑡𝑡 . This is tautology, unless greater structure is imposed. 6
𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐

𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟

The combination of 𝜖𝜖ℎ,𝑡𝑡 = 𝜖𝜖ℎ,𝑡𝑡 = 0 in Equations (4) and (5) yields uncovered

interest rate parity. Only when combined with the assumption of rational expectations,

which the covered interest differential is attributed to political risk.

When the covered interest differential is zero, the first covariance term is zero. This has
been the conventional approach; however, recent work has documented the fact that
covered interest differentials have increased in recent years (Borio et al., 2016; Du et al.,
2018), and so we do not impose this assumption in our analysis. In the absence of covered

interest differentials, as long as there is a time varying risk premium or biased
expectations, then 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝(𝛽𝛽̂ ) will deviate from unity.

The literature testing variants of the uncovered interest rate parity hypothesis is

vast and varied. Most of the studies fall into the category employing the rational
expectations hypothesis; in our lexicon, that means they are tests of the unbiasedness
hypothesis. Estimates of equation (6) using horizons for up to one year typically reject
the unbiasedness restriction on the slope parameter. For instance, the survey by Froot and
Thaler (1990), finds an average estimate for β of -0.88. 8 Bansal and Dahlquist (2000)
provide more mixed results, when examining a broader set of advanced and emerging
market currencies. They also note that the failure of unbiasedness appears to depend upon

7
Note that the definition of the expectation or forecast error is the negative of the convention, i.e., actual
minus forecast.
8
Similar results are cited in surveys by MacDonald and Taylor (1992) and Isard (1995). Meese and Rogoff
(1983) show that the forward rate is outpredicted by a random walk, which is consistent with the failure of
the unbiasedness hypothesis.

Frankel and

Poonawala (2010) document that for emerging markets more generally, the unbiasedness
hypothesis coefficient is typically more positive. 11
The poor performance of the interest differential as a predictor shows up in other
ways. At short horizons, the interest differential is outperformed by a random walk model
of the exchange rate (Cheung et al., 2005; Cheung et al., 2019). However, at longer
horizons, the interest differential does much better than a random walk, mirroring the
fewer rejections of the unbiasedness hypothesis at longer horizons documented by Chinn
and Meredith (2004).
There is an alternative approach that involves using survey-based data to measure
𝑓𝑓

exchange rate expectations. In this case, the error term in equation (6), 𝜖𝜖𝑡𝑡+ℎ , need not be
a true innovation. It could have a non-zero mean, be serially correlated, and perhaps

correlated with the interest differential. Froot and Frankel (1989) were early expositors of
this approach. In a related vein, Chinn and Frankel (1994) document that it was more
difficult to reject UIP for a broad set of currencies when using survey based forecasts.
Similar results were obtained by Chinn and Frankel (2019), when extending the data up
to 2009, increasing the sample to about 32 years. This pattern of findings suggests that
the assumption of rational expectations is not innocuous, and that the examination of the

Flood and Rose (1996, 2002) note that including currency crises and devaluations, one finds more
evidence for the unbiasedness hypothesis.
10
See Hassan and Mano (2017) for a different perspective on how the Fama puzzle relates to the carry
trade.
11
Chinn and Meredith (2004) tested the UIP hypothesis at five year and ten year horizons for the Group of
Seven (G7) countries, and found greater support for the UIP hypothesis holding at these long horizons than
at shorter horizons of three to twelve months. The estimated coefficient on the interest rate differentials
were positive and were closer to the value of unity than to zero in general.

UIP condition both assuming and dispensing with the rational expectation assumption is
warranted.
One approach we will not investigate is the bias arising from improper restrictions
in the estimation methodology, such as coefficient restrictions when there is substantial
persistence (Moore, 1994; Zivot, 2000), unbalanced regressions (Maynard and Phillips,
2001), nonlinearity due to thresholds (Baillie and Kilic, 2006), and issues of cointegration
(Chinn and Meredith, 2005).
3. Fama Regressions
We collected monthly data for the interest rates and currencies of eight economies -Canada, Switzerland, Japan, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, UK and the euro area – over the
Jan. 1999 – June 2019 period. We examined offshore interest rates of twelve month
maturities; the use of offshore interest rates has historically obviated the need to account
for the impact of capital controls. 12
Figure 2 depicts twelve month maturity yield differentials, while Figure 3 shows
twelve month depreciations, all over the 1999-2019 period. One of the contrasts clearly
highlighted by the two figures is that while yield differentials have shrunk toward zero in
the wake of the global financial crisis – at least until about 2015 --, exchange rate
depreciations have not exhibited a comparable compression.

To begin with, we adopt the standard assumption of no default risk. In general, this is believed to hold.
During the height of the global financial crisis, counterparty risk was perceived as high (along with
liquidity issues), so that covered interest parity did not hold (Coffey et al., 2009; Baba and Packer, 2009).
12

8

Table 1 reports in Panel A the results from equation (2) at the twelve month
horizon, for the full sample. 13 The results are largely in accord with previous findings. In
general, the slope coefficients on the interest differential (i.e., the “Fama coefficient”) are
negative, although the coefficients are not statistically different from zero in most cases.
Given that under the maintained hypothesis the coefficient should be unity, we also test if
the coefficients are different from unity. It turns out that only the Swiss Franc differs
significantly from one. Even when the coefficients are not significantly different from
unity, it is important to recall that the proportion of variation explained is very small.
The Fama regression represents a non-structural relationship. There is little reason
to believe the same results will hold over time, in the face of changes in the ways policies
are implemented. For instance, as policy regimes change, the expectation formation
process will change too. Changes in the general economic environment will also have an
impact. The global financial crisis provides an obvious break-point to examine. We
carried out various statistical tests to precisely identify the break date. All the eight
currencies involved in our analysis exhibit a significant break over the sample, but there
is no common date that immediately comes out of the analysis. However, all the
currencies show a significant break around the years 2007-08, according to a Chow test.
In this respect we decide to choose August 2007 (which corresponds to August 2006 for
the one year interest rates) as a common break date, keeping in mind that the summer
2007 can be considered as the beginning of the Global Financial Crisis, with the turmoil
on the US housing market. Indeed, on August 9, 2007, BNP Paribas announced that it
was closing three hedge funds that specialised in US mortgage debt. This event is often

considered as one of the first tangible signals of the financial crisis as it was followed by
a freeze on the interbank lending market. According to the NBER Dating Committee, the
US economic recession started three months later in December 2007. Thus separating the
sample into pre- and post-crisis periods with ex post exchange rate depreciations ending
August 2007 as break point (interest rates ending at August 2006), we obtain the results
presented in Panel B and Panel C of Table 1. In the pre-crisis period, the coefficients are
uniformly negative, significantly different from unity.
The most remarkable finding we obtain is that during the post-crisis period (after
2006M09 for interest rates), exchange rate depreciations are strongly, and positively,
related to the interest differentials. The estimated coefficients range from 0.8 to 8.3. The
null hypothesis of unity is rejected for half of the coefficients. 14 To our knowledge, the
only other study documenting something similar to our findings is Baillie and Cho
(2014). However, their analysis only extends up to 2012, and -- unlike the results we
obtain -- their estimates are not unambiguously positive at the end of their sample.
To highlight the change in how the relationship between interest differentials and
ex post depreciations change over time, we focus on the British pound, in Figure 4. The
stabilization of the interest differential, compared to pound depreciations, is now obvious.
One way to illustrate the contrast pre- and post-crisis, not evident in
Figure 4, is to show a scatterplot of depreciation against the yield differential. Figure 5
depicts the data for the two periods. In the pre-crisis period, the slope is negative (as in
the conventional wisdom), while in the post-crisis period, it is clearly positive. Another
In a previous version of this paper with interest rate samples ending at February 2015, only one
coefficient (for the Danish krone) rejected the unit null.
14

10

way to illustrate this finding is to show the evolution of the beta coefficients from rolling
Fama regressions. Figure 6 shows beta coefficients obtained from regressing the US
dollar depreciation over twelve months on interest differentials for centred rolling
windows of three years. Results confirm the switch of signs of coefficients from negative
to positive in the post-crisis period. More importantly, most of beta coefficients stay
positive in the aftermath of the global financial crisis (with the exception of the Japanese
yen and the Norwegian krone.), therefore suggesting that a persistent change in
correlations has occurred. Remarkably, this stylized fact holds for various base currencies
(see Appendix Table 1).
These results confront the researcher with at least two questions. The first is the
longstanding puzzle of why the bias exists; the second is why the correlation changed so
much after the crisis.
With respect to the first question, one approach is to allow for an exchange risk
𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟

𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐

premium, i.e., drop the assumption of 𝜖𝜖𝑡𝑡 = 0 (but retain the assumption of 𝜖𝜖𝑡𝑡

= 0).

∗
Doing so means that the error 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡+ℎ in 𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡+ℎ − 𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽�𝑖𝑖ℎ,𝑡𝑡 − 𝑖𝑖ℎ,𝑡𝑡
� + 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡+ℎ includes a

term that is potentially correlated with the interest differential. A potential solution is to

include as an additional regressor some variable that proxies for an exchange risk
𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟

premium, 𝜖𝜖𝑡𝑡 . This suggests the following regression equation: 15
(8)

∗
𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡+ℎ − 𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽�𝑖𝑖ℎ,𝑡𝑡 − 𝑖𝑖ℎ,𝑡𝑡
� + 𝛾𝛾𝑍𝑍𝑡𝑡 + 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡+ℎ ,

If the exchange risk premium is a mean zero random error term, there is no need to include a proxy
variable. If, however, there is a central bank reaction function that essentially makes the error term
correlated with the interest differential (as in a Taylor rule), then the estimates obtained from a simple
Fama regression will be biased. Variants of this approach include McCallum (1994), in which the central
bank responds to exchange rate depreciation, and Chinn and Meredith (2004), in which exchange rate
depreciation feeds into output and inflation gaps that determine central bank policy rates. See also Mark
and Wu (1998) and Engel (2014).
15

11

where 𝑍𝑍 is a proxy variable.

We evaluate the results using the VIX as a proxy measure

16

. The VIX is a

commonly used measure of (inverse) risk appetite, and has been shown to have
substantial explanatory power for exchange rates (Hossfeld and MacDonald, 2015,
Ismailov and Rossi, 2018) and for excess returns (Brunnermeier et al., 2008, Habib and
Stracca, 2012, or Husted et al., forthcoming). 17
The results of the VIX augmented Fama regressions are reported in Table 2 and
are notable in the following sense. The inclusion of the VIX does not alter the basic
pattern of results for the Fama coefficient estimates found in Panel A of Table 1.
However, the estimate of the VIX coefficient is typically negative, though only
significant half of the time. This means that when the VIX rises, the dollar appreciates
relative to the foreign currency, even after controlling for the interest rate differential.
Only in the case of the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, well known safe haven
currencies, does the reverse occur. 18
4. Testing UIP with Survey Data
Another way of testing whether arbitragers equalize expected returns is by
𝑓𝑓

dropping the assumption of mean zero expectations error, namely 𝐸𝐸𝑡𝑡 �𝜖𝜖𝑡𝑡+1 � = 0 in
equation (6). It might be that agents are truly irrational, they use bounded rationality, or

Note that we also evaluate inflation differentials (and industrial production growth differentials) as
proxies for a premium, in this case a liquidity premium, in line with Engel et al.’s (2019) model of forward
rate bias (and high interest-high value currencies). However, we do not obtain empirical evidence for the
usefulness of those variables in explaining the Fama puzzle.
17
See Berg and Mark (2018) for discussion of uncertainty and the risk premium.
18
The results are sensitive to the sample period selected. In other results, we have detected a sensitivity of
the Fama coefficient to different levels of the VIX, using threshold regression. Hence, while augmenting
the Fama regression with the VIX does not alter the estimates of the Fama coefficient, this result does not
speak to whether the VIX enters in some nonlinear fashion.
16

have not completely learned the model governing the economy (or, as in Mark and Wu,
1998, some agents are noise traders).
This means we replace equation (6) with:
(9)

𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀

𝑀𝑀
𝑠𝑠̂𝑡𝑡+ℎ
= 𝐸𝐸𝑡𝑡𝑀𝑀 [𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡+ℎ ] − 𝜖𝜖𝑡𝑡+ℎ

𝑀𝑀
The observed survey based measure of the future spot rate, 𝑠𝑠̂𝑡𝑡+1
, equals the market’s

expectation, up to a mean zero random error. 19 There is no assumption, then, that the exante measure will be an unbiased measure of the ex post measure.
This substitution leads to the following regression equation (where we have not
suppressed the exchange risk premium):
(10)

𝑀𝑀
∗
𝑠𝑠̂𝑡𝑡+ℎ
− 𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽�𝑖𝑖ℎ,𝑡𝑡 − 𝑖𝑖ℎ,𝑡𝑡
� + 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡+ℎ

In this case, the regression error impounds the forecast error; there is no guarantee that
this forecast error is mean zero, and uncorrelated with the interest differential -- or for
that matter, the risk proxy.
We use as measures of expectations survey data sourced from Consensus
Forecasts from 2003M01 to 2018M06. Notice that survey data availability necessitates a
change in the sample period. 20
The results of the regressions are reported in Table 3. One of the defining features
of the results is (1) the point estimates are almost uniformly positive (except for the
19
In other words, we are assuming Classical measurement error, in line with most other analyses. Constant
bias would be impounded in the constant. Time varying bias would be much more problematic.
20
An additional complication is that the interest rates and exchange rates do not align precisely in this data
set. Interest rates are sampled at end-of-month, while exchange rates forecasts are sampled usually at the
second Monday of the month by Consensus Forecasts.

Canadian dollar), and (2) coefficients for the Swiss franc and Japanese yen are
significantly greater than one, confirming that those currencies are considered as safe
havens by practitioners. These results are consistent with those obtained in previous
studies using survey data, including Chinn and Frankel (1993) and Chinn and Frankel
(2019) 21.
Why are the results so different going from the ex-post to ex-ante measures? The
reason is that the two measures of exchange rate depreciation differ widely and that the
variation in ex-ante measures is substantially smaller than that of ex-post measures. One
way to highlight the difference in volatilities is to note that the scale typically ranges
from -0.12 to +0.22 for ex ante depreciations, while for ex-post depreciations the range is
-0.30 to +0.34.
Table 3 displays the beta coefficients for both horizons in the pre- and post-crisis
periods. Interestingly, the point estimates for twelve month changes do not point to a
switch in coefficients before and after the crisis.
5. Reconciling the Results
Thus far, we have documented the fact that Fama regressions tend to exhibit shifts in the
estimated parameters, while the regressions using survey data are less subject to such
shifts. This is suggestive of the idea that the characteristics of the expectations are critical
in explaining the structural breaks in the Fama regressions.

Skeptics of survey based measures argue that reported forecasts are read off of interest differentials.
Chinn and Frankel (1993) note the pattern of relationship between expected spot rates and forwards was
consistent with the idea that survey respondents use other information in judging future exchange rate
movements. In addition, Cheung and Chinn (2001) survey foreign exchange traders, and find that interest
differentials are only one of the inputs forecasters use.

where the relevant interest differential correlations with the covered interest differential,
exchange risk, and expectation errors are labelled A, B, and C, respectively. From this
decomposition, it is clear that an increase in the estimated β coefficients could in
principle be due to a decrease in A, B, or C. The fact that the use of survey expectations
reduces the presence of structural breaks suggests that the C term, involving forecast
errors, is of crucial importance.
In order to examine this conjecture more formally, we examine the regression
coefficients conforming to A, B, and C inverted so as to present a decomposition of
estimated (black squares) from UIP value (horizontal black line), for the pre- and postcrisis period, respectively. Estimates at the twelve month horizon are presented in Figure
7 for five currencies. For three currencies for which the Fama coefficient switches
strongly from pre- to post-crisis – the euro, the sterling and the Canadian dollar, – the big
change occurs in the expectations component. This is shown in Figure 7 (a), (d) and (e),
respectively. To be concrete, in the pre-crisis period, forecast errors defined as
∗
𝐸𝐸𝑡𝑡𝑀𝑀 [𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡+ℎ ] − 𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡+ℎ are positively correlated with �𝑖𝑖ℎ,𝑡𝑡 − 𝑖𝑖ℎ,𝑡𝑡
� (showing up as a negative

component in the decomposition); that correlation is very negative over the last decade

(showing up as above zero in the figures). Since these components are subtracted from
the value of unity, That drives estimated Fama coefficients from negative to positive
values.
15

Notice that the switch in the risk premium component – the B term – is not
particularly central to the switch in the Fama coefficient for any of the currencies. The
foregoing discussion suggests that the reason the Fama puzzle has evolved in the postcrisis period is mainly because of a change in how expectations errors co-move with
interest differentials – the C component – during this specific period of time.
What lies behind the change in the C component? For these currencies – save the
Swiss franc and Japanese yen – the forecast errors as defined in equation (6) change from
significantly negative in the pre-crisis period to insignificantly different from zero in the
post-crisis period. In words, that means through the 2007M08 period, the dollar
depreciated more than anticipated against these currencies save the yen.
Post-crisis, the shift in forecast errors was not uniformly in one direction. The
variance of the forecast errors increases, however, for these currencies. The combination
with marked declines for Canadian, Japanese and UK interest differentials heightens the
change in C component over the two time periods.
This means the reversals in the Fama coefficients is due in part to the larger
mistakes – in both directions – in forecasting dollar changes in the post-crisis period, and
very little is attributable to changes in exchange risk comovements. And still less is
associated with covered interest differentials comovements. 22
6. Conclusions
Our extensive cross-currency analysis of uncovered interest parity has yielded
new empirical results that will establish a new set of stylized facts.
At the three month horizon, the A components is slightly more important, but remains less significant
than the B and C components.
22

16

First, the bivariate relationship between ex-post depreciation and interest
differentials, as summarized in the Fama regression, is subject to breaks. While such
breaks have shown up in previous studies, the break associated with the global financial
crisis and the subsequent period of low interest rates is quantitatively and qualitatively
much more pronounced. The positive, albeit very large, Fama regression coefficient
detected in the last decade is not usually consistent with uncovered interest parity.
Moreover, even if the coefficient magnitude were consistent with UIP, the finding would
run counter to the intuition that UIP should hold when risk is not important, either
because the environment is not “risky”, or because agents are risk neutral.
Second, we find that the inclusion of a proxy variable for risk, in the form of the
VIX, results in Fama regression coefficients that are largely unchanged. An elevated VIX
typically appreciates the dollar, with few exceptions. Hence, the Fama puzzle is not
explained by risk, at least when proxied by the VIX in a linear specification.
Third, uncovered interest parity regressions estimated using survey data are less
indicative of breaks. That finding suggests that the breakdown in the Fama relationship is
related to the nature of expectations errors.
Fourth, a formal decomposition of deviations from the posited value of unity in
the Fama regression indicates that the switch in signs from pre- to post-crisis can be
attributed to a large extent to the switch in the nature of the co-movement between
expectations errors and interest differentials. This finding implies that the change in the
Fama coefficients is not necessarily a durable one. The phenomenon might dissipate as
the correlation changes, expectations error variability shrinks, or interest rate variability

17

rises – an outcome more likely if a sustained rise of rates above the zero lower bound is
maintained.
