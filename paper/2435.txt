The Real Exchange Rate and Employment in U.S. Manufacturing:
State and Regional Results

ABSTRACT

In a series of earlier papers we have examined the impact of exchange
rate movements on employment and output in the manufacturing sector,
disaggregated by industry sector and by production and non-production
workers. In this paper we examine the impact of exchange rate movements on
manufacturing employment, disaggregated geographically, using census
divisions, regions, states and SMSA's as the unit of analysis. Empirical
estimates of employment changes are first presented for the four census
regions, the nine census divisions, and the fifty states plus the District of
Columbia. For the country as a whole, we estimate that movements in the real
exchange rate led to the loss of about 1 million manufacturing jobs over this
period.
We go on to examine in greater detail manufacturing employment in New
York State, and report that exchange rate movements had a much larger impact
in the areas outside of New York City than in the metropolitan area. This
result is consistent with earlier work that found that employment in
management or research is not as sensitive to exchange rate movements as
employment in production processes.
The New York results are followed by an examination of manufacturing
employment in five southern states with large rural populations. Some policy
makers have expressed a concern that manufacturing employment in rural areas
suffered more than in urban areas during the period of the dollar
appreciation. We find that within these five states, the impact of the
exchange rate on manufacturing employment in the non-SMSA areas was the same
or less than was the case for employment within SMSA areas.
Finally, we use a multivariate model to explore why manufacturing
employment is more sensitive to exchange rate movements in some states than
in others. Factors which are associated with greater sensitivity of
manufacturing employment to exchange rate movements are: the percent of the
population living outside of SMSA areas, the level of production worker
wages, and crude oil production. Factors that are associated with less
sensitivity of manufacturing employment to exchange rate movements include
the percent of the population with 4 years or more of college or per-capita
expenditures on public secondary schools.

The Real Exchange Rate and Employment
In U.S. Manufacturjn2: State and Regional Results

I.

Introduction
In the first half of this decade the U.S. dollar experienced a dramatic

appreciation against foreign currencies, reaching a peak in the first quarter

of 1985, and falling since. In a series of earlier papers [Branson and Love,
1986; Branson 1986; Branson and Love, 1987] we have examined the impact of
exchange rate movements on employment and output in the manufacturing sector,
disaggregated by industry sector and by production and non-production workers.
In this paper we examine the impact of exchange rate movements on manufacturing
employment, disaggregated geographically, using census divisions, regions,
states and SMSA's as the unit of analysis.

In section II the econometric model and data are described, and in section
III the empirical estimates of employment changes are presented for the four
census regions, the nine census divisions, and the fifty states plus the

District of Columbia. This includes a decomposition of the change in
manufacturing employment from 1980 to 1985. For the country as a whole, we
estimate that movements in the real exchange rate led to the loss of about 1
million manufacturing jobs over this period.

In section IV we examine in greater detail manufacturing employment in New
York State, and report that exchange rate movements had a much larger impact in

the areas outside of New York City than in the metropolitan area. This result
is consistent with earlier work [Branson and Love, 1987] that found that

1

employment in management or research is not as sensitive to exchange rate
movements as employment in production processes.

The New York results are followed by Section V, which is an examination of
manufacturing employment in five southern states with large rural populations.
Many policy makers have expressed a concern that manufacturing employment in
rural areas suffered more than in urban areas during the period of the dollar

appreciation. We find that within these five states, the impact of the
exchange rate on manufacturing employment in the non-SMSA areas was the same or
less than was the case for employment within SMSA areas.

In Section VI we use a multivariate model to explore why manufacturing
employment is more sensitive to exchange rate movements in some states than in

others. Factors which are associated with greater sensitivity of manufacturing
employment to exchange rate movements are: the percent of the population
living outside of SMSA areas, the level of production worker wages, and crude

oil production. Factors that are associated with less sensitivity of
manufacturing employment to exchange rate movements include the percent of the
population with 4 years or more of college or per-capita expenditures on public

secondary schools, Once wages are controlled for, union membership is
associated with less sensitivity of manufacturing employment to exchange rate

movements, although this variable is only marginally significant. Factors that
are not statistically significant include population growth and defense
shipments or employment.

II. The Estimating Eauatiou and Data
The theoretical basis for the estimating equation used below is described

in detail in Branson and Love (1986;1987). A model of supply based on the

2

product wage and demand based on income and relative home and foreign prices is

used to derive the reduced form estimating equation described below. In our
previous work that disaggregated manufacturing employment by industry we used
the same estimating equation for each industry sector, ignoring special

sectoral demand shocks and cost effects. The same approach is used here, where
the one reduced form model is applied to all geographic areas.
The left-hand dependent variable is the natural logarithm of employment.

The right-hand independent variables include a constant, three variables to

capture secular, cyclical and

structural

changes in demand, and the real

exchange rate. The secular and cyclical variables are time [TREND] and the
natural logarithm of the national unemployment rate [LURT]. The structural
variable is the natural logarithm of an index to measure the real price of

energy [LRENGY]. The exchange rate variable is the natural logarithm of an
index that measures the real U.S. trade-weighted exchange rate [LREX]. The
form of the estimating equation is:

and

The data used to estimate equation (5) are quarterly. The equations are
estimated over a period that begins in first quarter 1970 and ends in first

quarter 1986. In Branson and Love (1987) we experimented with different
estimation periods and concluded that 1970 - 1986 was most representative. The

estimates are based on 65 observations and 46 degrees of freedom. The BeachMacKinnon (1978) maximum likelihood procedure for correcting first order
autocorrelation was used.

The source of the data on employment is the Bureau of Labor Statistics'

(BLS) Employment and Earnings. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm
of the number of employed workers. Unless noted otherwise, the estimates are

for J. workers in the manufacturing sector.
The exchange rate used here is the INF index of relative unit labor costs,
where an increase in the index is an apDreciation of the dollar.

The real

energy index is the CPI-Urban index for energy divided by the CPI-Urban index

for all consumer goods. The unemployment rate is for all workers.

The

exchange rate variable LREX includes the current observation plus six quarters

of lagged observations. The real energy price LRENGY and the unemployment rate
LURT variables both include the current value plus four quarters of lags.

Because the model is in log linear form, the estimated coefficients have

simple economic interpretations. The coefficient for the TREND variable Ct) is
the estimated exponential rate of growth or decline in employment that occurs
due to secular changes in income, tastes, comparative advantage, or technology.
A coefficient for TREND of -.001 means that, holding everything else constant,

employment will decline at the rate of 0.1 percent each quarter. The
coefficients for the real exchange rate, the real price of energy, and the

unemployment rate variables can

be interpreted as elasticities. For example, a
4

coefficient of -. 3 for the real exchange rate variable LREX means that a 10

percent increase in the exchange rate will lead to a 3 percent decrease in the
number of workers employed.

III. Estimates for States and Regions
Table S-l reports the estimated coefficients of equation (5) for the 50

states plus the District of Columbia. The table reports the first order
autocorrelation coefficient RHO, the coefficients for each of the independent

variables, and a significance statistic. When independent variables are
lagged, the coefficient represents the sum of all lagged coefficients. The
significance measure [SIG] is the probability that the true value of the sum of

the coefficients is zero, using a two-tailed t-test. The standard error [SE]
for the sum of the exchange rate coefficients is also reported. In Table S-2,
the results from Table S-i are sorted by the size of the LREX coefficient. For
the group as a whole, the LREX coefficient is negative for 45 states, and is

positive for six others. The LREX coefficient is statistically significant in
36 cases, including 35 where the coefficient is negative, and one, the District
of Columbia, where the sign is positive.

The variable TREND is negative in 15 cases and positive in 36. For 50 of
the 51 cases the sign of the coefficient for the national unemployment rate
[URATE] has the expected negative sign, although the size of this coefficient
shows considerable variance across states.

The energy price variable is negative in 17 of the 51 cases, and

statistically significant for 20 states. Of the twenty statistically
significant cases, the coefficient is positive for 15. The statistically
significant and positive energy coefficients are found both in states that are

5

major energy producers such as Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, Wyoming, and
Pennsylvania, and in states that are not, such as New York, Maryland,

Washington, and Vermont. In some states the energy coefficient appears to
represent the direct costs of higher energy inputs, such as for Michigan, where
the coefficient is - .45 for a state that depends heavily upon the automobile
industry, whereas in other states, such as New York or Vermont, the
relationship is less obvious.

The estimated coefficients presented in Tables S-l and S-2 provide one
measure of the importance of the exchange rate to the manufacturing sector.

These estimated elasticities give the percentage changes in employment that are
predicted for a percentage change in the exchange rate.

It is often helpful,

however, to have estimates of the number of jobs that will be affected by

exchange rate movements. Table S-3 provides these estimates.
Columns (c) and (d) in Table S-3 report the number of workers, in
thousands, employed in manufacturing in each state in 1980 and 1985

respectively. For the country as a whole, employment in manufacturing declined
from 20.4 million to 19.3 million, a loss of more than 1 million jobs. To
decompose this employment change into the components attributed to the real
exchange rate and other factors, the estimated model is used to predict the
1985 employment given historical values for the four independent variables,

TREND, LRENGY, LURT, and

LREX. These

numbers are reported in Column (f).

Next, the predicted 1985 employment is recalculated four times, each time
using the historical data for three of the series, but substituting the average

1980 values for the fourth independent variable. These new calculations
represent the predicted value for employment, given the counter-factual case
where the values for one of the independent variables remained at its 1980

6

level. The differences between the predictions based on the actual and the
counter-factual values for the independent variables are the changes in

employment that are attributed to the independent variables. These
"components't of the change in employment are reported in columns (h), (i), (j)

and (k), for each of the four independent variables. Column (1), which is
labeled RESID, for the unexplained residual change, is the difference between
the actual change, and the change attributed to the four independent
variables1.

Looking for a moment at column (k), we see that for the country as a
whole, an estimated 1.1 million jobs were lost from 1980 to 1985 due to the
appreciation of the dollar, representing about 5.7 percent of the 1985
employment in the manufacturing sector.

Among the individual states, the largest job losses are: 112 thousand for
Texas, 101 thousand for Ohio, 98 thousand for Michigan, 97 thousand for

Illinois, 79 thousand for California, and 74 thousand for Pennsylvania. As a
percentage of the 1985 work force, the greatest estimated job losses were in
North Dakota, 24.5 percent, Nevada, 19.2 percent, Wyoming, 17.3 percent,

Kansas, 17.2 percent, and West Virginia, 17.2 percent, --

five

states with

large rural areas. Several large "rust belt" industrial states also
experienced large percentage losses, including Ohio, 9 percent, Illinois, 9.9
percent, Indiana,

9.3

percent, Michigan, 10 percent, and Pennsylvania, 6.8

percent. Several industrial states from the North East were less affected than
the nation as a whole by exchange rate movements, including Massachusetts, +.7
percent, New York, +1.1 percent, and New Jersey, -.3 percent.

In Tables R-l and R-2 the same estimates are presented for manufacturing
employment disaggregated by the four census regions and the nine census

7

divisions. Among the census divisions, the largest exchange rate effect is
found in the four central divisions [East North Central, West North Central,

East South Central, and West South Central], while the smallest exchange rate
effect was found in the three divisions on the Atlantic coast [New England,

Middle Atlantic, and South Atlantic]. The differences in sensitivity to the
real exchange rate are clearest among the regions, though. All four regions
have significant negative coefficients, with North Central longest at -0.30,
North East smallest at -0.04, and South and West in the middle at -0.17 and
-0. 13 respectively.

The regional distribution of employment changes and exchange rate effects

are shown in Figures R-l and R-2. These show, respectively, the percentage
changes in manufacturing employment from 1980 to 1985, and the size of the

estimated real exchange rate coefficient, by census division. Figure R-l shows
that employment losses were largest in the tirust belt," followed by the central

states. Figure R-2 shows that the dollar appreciation was a major cause of
this loss in the Great Lakes states from Ohio west, and in the central states.

In New York and Pennsylvania, other factors were at work. Figure R-2 also
shows that the dollar appreciation reduced manufacturing employment more in the
central states than in the coastal and western states.

One possible explanation for the differences in exchange rate sensitivity

across states is industry mix. Other differences among states may also be
important, including labor market or geographic characteristics. To test for
such factors, and to check for consistency with earlier results, we estimate
models for regions and sectors within several states in sections IV and V.
Finally, several models of the state exchange rate coefficient [LREX] are
estimated in Section VI.

8

IV. NEW YORK STATE
New York is an interesting state for. a number of reasons. The total
number of manufacturing jobs in New York in 1985, 1.295 million ranks second

behind California. Unlike California, however, and like several other large
industrial states such as Illinois or Pennsylvania, New York experienced a

large decline in manufacturing employment in the l980s. From 1980 to 1985 New
York lost about 150 thousand manufacturing jobs, or more than 10 percent of the

1980 New York manufacturing work force. Despite the fact that manufacturing
employment declined sharply while the dollar appreciated, the estimated impact

of the exchange rate on New York manufacturing employment was negligible. That
is, for New York, the exchange rate coefficient, is .02, and not statistically
different from zero.

The large decline in New York manufacturing employment and a small or zero
estimated LREX coefficient are consistent if factors other than the exchange

rate explain recent employment changes. For example, New York experienced
declines in manufacturing employment for several years prior to the exchange

rate appreciation. Hence, the negative trend of employment may have been
independent of exchange rate movements. Moreover, industries that have fared
well under the dollar appreciation, like print and publishing, are well

represented in New York. Finally, as noted in our earlier work [Branson and
Love, 19871, there is a significant difference between the impact of exchange

rate movements on production workers and non-production workers. New York
State, and New York City in particular, might be expected to house a higher
proportion of non-production management employees than other states.

9

In Table NY-i the estimated coefficients for the model of manufacturing

employment in New York State are presented. Within the non-durable goods
sector the exchange-rate coefficients for three of eight sectors, Food and
Kindred Products, Tobacco Products, and Print and Publishing, are positive and

statistically significant. Within the durable goods sector, five of seven
sectors have exchange rate coefficients that are statistically significant, and

four of them are negative. Table NY-2 provides the simulated decomposition of
employment change, and Table NY-3 compares the estimated LREX coefficients for
New York to those reported in our earlier work [Branson and Love, 1987], using

national data. The national coefficients include those for all workers,
production workers, and non-production workers. As noted above, the New York
estimates are for all workers. Considering, for the moment, the national
estimates for all workers, we can see that for many industries the coefficients
for New York are substantially different from the national estimates, including
changes in signs, although for the five industries where both the NY and the
national coefficients are statistically significant, the signs are the same.

New Yorkts two largest non-durable goods sectors in terms of employment,
[Apparel and other Textile Products, Print and Publishing] have positive LREX

coefficients. The three largest New York durable goods industries include two
with negative coefficients [Non-Electrical Machinery, Instruments and Related

Products] and one with a positive coefficient [Electrical Machinery]. Overall,
the industry mix for New York does not seem to explain why New York
manufacturing suffered less than other states from the dollar appreciation.

Indeed, in 13 of 15 industries, the New York LREX coefficients are
substantially more positive than is the case for the estimates for all workers
for the nation as a whole.

10

Some of the difference appears to be related to the types of jobs that one

would expect in New York. For example, for the Tobacco Manufactures, and
Electrical and Electronic Equipment sectors, the New York LREX coefficients
have a different sign from the national estimates for all workers, but the same

sign for non-production workers. Moreover, for both sectors, the coefficients
for New York and the national non-production workers are statistically
significant and close in size.

In Table NY-4, New York manufacturing is disaggregated by region. The top
row in the table provides the estimates for the state as a whole. The
remainder of the table is broken up into areas that are in or out of the New

York City or Long Island area. Within the areas that are not adjacent to New
York City, the exchange rate coefficient is statistically significant four

times, all of which are have a negative sign. New York City and Nassau-Suffolk
counties (Long Island) have statistically significant LREX coefficients of .12

and .10, respectively. When the area outside of New York City and NassauSuffolk is aggregated, it has a statistically significant coefficient of -. 11,

virtually the mirror image of New York City and the adjacent areas.
The comparison between New York City and Long Is land and the rest of the

state, or what might be called the up-state vs. down-state disparity, may be
due to the differences in the impact of exchange rate movements on production

worker vs. non-production worker jobs. For New York, this might also be
referred to as the tlheadquarterstl factor, because many large manufacturing

firms locate management offices and research centers in or near New York City.

V. FIVE

SOUTHERN STATES: URBAN AND NON-URBAN AREAS

11

The New York results are suggestive concerning the role of urban areas.
That fact that New York City has fared much better than the less urban upstate areas of New York state raises the possibility that urban areas in

general may have been less effected than rural areas. Moreover, regional
specialists who study rural economic development have expressed concern that
the 1980-1985 dollar appreciation may have reversed a decade of rapid growth fri

manufacturing employment in rural communities, and may lead to severe
dislocation problems as these areas have become more dependent upon

manufacturing as farm employment declines. Whether or not the more recent
decline in the value of the dollar will lead to a return of the growth rates in

manufacturing employment that were seen in the l97Os is uncertain, and depends
upon the hysteresis effects discussed in Branson and Love (1987).

In Table SMSA-l, the estimated equations for manufacturing employment for
five southern states are presented, disaggregated by SMSA and non-SMSA areas.

For each state, all SMSAs included on the BLS States and Regions: Emlovment
and Earnings tape are examined, as are statewide aggregates for all
manufacturing employees, and those working in SMSA areas and non-SMSA areas.
Comparison of the SMSA and NONSMSA rows for each state shows that,

contrary to the results from New York, manufacturing employment in the more
rural, or non-SMSA areas is no more sensitive to exchange rate movements that

the more urban SNSA areas. On the other hand, all of the states in Table SMSA1 are relatively more rural than New York as a whole, and every one of them has
an overall exchange rate coefficient that is statistically significant and very
negative, ranging from -. 15 for Alabama to -

.51

for West Virginia.

VI. A MODEL OF EXCHANGE RATE COEFFICIENTS DIFFERENCES

12

Another method of examining the differences between states is to estimate
a multivariate model for the estimated parameter or parameters of interest.
The explanatory variables are geographic, economic, or labor market

characteristics that vary across states. We have chosen the following area
characteristics for our model:

COLLEGE: the percent of the population with four or more years of
college in 1980;

EDSPEND: the state per capita expenditures on public primary and
secondary schools, in 1980;

NONSMSA: the percent of the population living outside of areas
defined as Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas by the Bureau of
the Census in 1980;

OILPROD: the per capita production of crude oil in 1980;

HRWAGE: the average hourly wage for production workers, in 1981;

UNION: the percent of the work force that belongs to a collective
bargaining union, in 1980;

GROWTH: the percent population growth, from 1970 to 1980;

13

DEF EMP: the percent of the population employed in a defense
industry, in 1983;

DEF SHP: the per capita defense contract shipments in 1983.

The dependant variable in each across-state regression is the estimated
exchange rate coefficient LREX, for all fifty states plus the District of

Columbia. There is a potential problem of hetroscedasticity, as some LREX
coefficients are estimated more precisely than others. To correct for this, we
use the method of weighted least squares, choosing our weights to be the
inverse of the estimated standard errors for the LREX coefficients, as

suggested by Saxonhouse [1976, 1977]. To provide a unit free measure of the
importance of different area characteristics, the dependent and all independent

variables transformed into standard normal variables [Z scores]. That is, we
have subtracted the mean and divided each variable by its standard deviation- -

so that each variable has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.
15 variations of the model were estimated, and the results are presented
in Table S-4.

For each model, a number of items are reported, including the

R2 adjusted for degrees of freedom, RBAR2; the number of degrees of freedom,
DOF; the coefficient for the explanatory variable, COEFF; and the T-Statistic,
TSTAT, and significance level for the coefficient, SIG.

Each model includes a constant term, plus two or more other explanatory

variables2. Since the left hand LREX coefficients are generally negative, a
positive sign on the coefficient for the explanatory variables means that the

variable is associated with a LREX coefficient that is less negative. That is,
a positive sign means that a large value for the variable is associated with a

14

state where manufacturing employment experiences less of an adverse impact from

an appreciation of the dollar. If one makes the simplifying assumption that
all manufactured goods are traded and gross substitutes for foreign
manufactured goods, then a positive sign is associated with a state where
manufacturing employment is less sensitive to foreign trade, while a negative
sign is associated with more sensitivity to foreign trade.

The COLLEGE and EDSPEND variables are designed to measure the influence of
education on the degree to which manufacturing employment is sensitive to

foreign trade. The EDSPEND variable measures an input of the education system,
the per capita expenditures on public primary and secondary schools. The
COLLEGE variable measures an output of the education system, the percent of the
3
population that are college graduates .

Both variables are proxies for a

measure of the quality or training of the labor market, which in turn is an

input to the manufacturing process. The education variables are interesting
for a number of reasons. There is a strong presumption among policy makers
that a highly educated work force is necessary to compete in the world economy.
States with high levels of educational achievement are likely to be states
where so-called "high tech" industries are located.

Either the COLLEGE or the EDSPEND variable is included in 14 of the 15

models estimated. In each case, the estimated coefficient is positive. For
the variable COLLEGE, the coefficient ranges between .27 and .47, depending
upon the model, and is statistically significant in all of the models,

indicating that the results are very robust to model specification. The
EDSPEND variable is used twice as an alternative to COLLEGE, and is

statistically significant for one model but not for the other. There is a
important interaction effect between the EDSPEND variable and the variable

15

NONSMSA, which measures the degree of urbanization in the state. That is, once
the degree of urbanization is controlled for, EDSPEND is no longer
statistically significant, suggesting that the two variables are collinear.

The fraction of a state's work force that is college-educated reduces the
sensitivity of its manufacturing employment to variations in the real exchange

rate. This is consistent with the production vs. non-production worker
differences found in Branson and Love (1987), and the up-state vs. down-state
differential in New York.

The variable NONSMSA, which is a measure of the degree of how rural [non

urban] the state is, is used in 11 models. The coefficient is negative in all
11 models, ranging from -.25 to -.48, and is statistically significant at the

.05 level in ten models. Like the coefficient for COLLEGE, the NONSMSA
coefficient is robust to model specification. The negative sign means that the
more rural the state, the more sensitive manufacturing employment in the state
is to foreign trade.

The variable HRWAGE is used in 12 models. It is negative and
statistically significant at the .01 level in all 12 models, with values
ranging from - .43 to -.66. The negative sign means that the higher the

production-worker wages in a state, the greater the sensitivity of
manufacturing employment is to foreign trade.

The variable UNION is used in 11 models. There are important interaction
effects between the UNION variable and the HRWAGE and NONSMSA variables. In
the one model where UNION is used without the HRWAGE variable, it is negative

and not statistically significant. When included with the HRWAGE variable, the

UNION coefficient is positive in all 10 cases. In those 10 cases, the variable
UNION is statistically significant at the .05 level in three models where

16

NONSMSA is

included, and not statistically significant at the .05 in the

seven cases where NONSMSA

included. This variable is marginally

significant, however, in four of the seven models that included NONSMSA, with

T-Statistics between 1.64 and 1.85 for P values of .07 to .11. The robustness
of the sign of the UNION variable suggests that, controlling for wage levels,

the higher the percentage of the work force belonging to a union, the less the

sensitivity of employment to foreign trade. Possible explanations for this
might be that high union membership reflects a more skilled work force that is

not as easily displaced by foreign competition, or that union membership leads
to political power and the ability to secure protection from foreign

competition during periods of a currency appreciation. As noted above,
however, the UNION coefficient is

statistically significant at the .05

level when the NONSMSA variable is included, and

the

sign changes when the

level of production worker wages is not controlled for.

The variable GROWTH is used in three models, but is never statistically
significant.

The variable OILPROD is used in three models, and is negative in all three

cases, and statistically significant at the .05 level twice. In interpreting
this variable it is worth noting that the BLS does not include mining
employment in the manufacturing employment series, and that the LREX
coefficient was estimated in a model that included a separate variable, LRENGY,

to control for changes in the relative price of energy. A negative sign for
this variable means that the greater the oil production in the state, the more

sensitive is manufacturing employment to the strength of the dollar. Whether
the demand for manufactured goods in those states is a function of the income
from oil production, or the production processes of crude oil or its products,

17

the negative sign of this coefficient is no surprise. Crude oil and petroleum
products are traded commodities, and domestic prices are inversely related to
the strength of the dollar.

The defense industry variable, DEF_EMP, is positive and statistically
significant in model 10, which only includes HRWAGE and UNION as additional

explanatory variables. When the variable COLLEGE is added, however, DEF_EMP
losses all its explanatory power. The sign of the coefficient changes
depending upon the specification of the model, and for all models that include

COLLEGE, the DEF_EMP coefficient has very low tStatistics. Likewise, the
variable DEF_SHP has virtually no explanatory power at all in the models where

it is tested. Other than signalling the skill or education level of the workforce, neither defense variable has explanatory power. Finally, the variable
GROWTH, measured by population growth, is introduced in three models, and has
insignificant coefficients each time.

Summary

The results for the NONSMSA variable in this section need to be reconciled
with the urban-rural results in section V.

In five southern states, the

exchange-rate coefficients were not significant by different between urban

(SMSA) and rural (NON SMSA) parts of the state. But across all states, the
size of the (negative) coefficient is significantly positively related to the

fraction of the state population living outside an SMSA. This suggests that
there are strong urban-rural differences in other states than the five examined

in section V. This is a topic we are now investigating.

FOOTNOTE S

1.

The calculations reported in Table 2 are the average of quarterly values,
simulated as described in the text. The predicted values for 1985 are based on
lagged values for the independent variables, and calculations based on the
summed lagged coefficients reported in Table 1 will lead to somewhat different
answers than those in Table 2, which are based on the particular lag structure
estimated by the model.

2. The non zero value of the constant is due to the fact that a weighted least
squares technique was used, and also due to a truncation of the sample size
where there are missing values for independent variables.
3. Although not necessarily the same education system as that of the state
itself.
