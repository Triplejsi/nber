The New Prescription Drug Paradox: Pipeline Pressure and Rising Prices

ABSTRACT
Economic literature has extensively studied how prices for incumbent pharmaceutical drugs respond
to generic competition after entry. However, less attention has been paid to pricing behavior in anticipation
of brand-to-brand competition. We contribute to this gap in the literature by both developing a model
of pricing strategies for incumbent drug manufacturers under tiered-insurance anticipating branded
competition. Our model predicts rising prices for incumbent drugs for a range of elasticities as the
likelihood of entry increases from competitors with horizontally-differentiated products. Using the
insulin market as a natural experiment, we exploit exogenous variation in a potential entrant's completion
of clinical trials to identify the effect of drug pipeline pressure on the prices of incumbent drugs. Results
suggest that pipeline pressure significantly increases the prices of incumbent drugs. We expect that
similar pricing effects will be prevalent with potential biosimilar entry.

Several studies have recently documented rising prices for pharmaceuticals in various therapeutic areas,
especially among branded drugs [Hua et al. (2016); Bennette et al. (2016); Hartung et al. (2015); Howard et al.
(2015)]. Brand-name drugs account for 72 percent of drug spending, though they comprise only 10 percent
of prescriptions dispensed in the U.S. [Kesselheim, Avorn and Sarpatwari (2016); Generic Pharmaceutical
Association (2015); Express Scripts (2015)]. Among the most commonly used branded drugs, prices increased
by about 164 percent between 2008 and 2015, greatly outpacing inflation (Office of the Assistant Secretary
for Planning and Evaluation 2016). These trends are quite different from pricing trends observed in markets
with generic drugs or over-the-counter drugs. Despite these considerable observed differences, the majority
of our understanding in prescription drug pricing and entry relies on literature focused primarily on the
competitive effects of generic drugs. The original prescription drug paradox referred to a phenomenon
following generic entry whereby price-sensitive consumers switched to the generic and prices among brand
name drugs subsequently rose as the remaining demand for brand name drugs was less elastic.
The new prescription drug paradox refers to a phenomenon of increasing prices corresponding with an
increasing number of branded competitors. These escalating prices are perplexing given that as more treatment options become available over time, patients and insurers should have more flexibility and bargaining
power in both drug choice and drug costs. Furthermore, these rising prices may be symptomatic of concerns
highlighted by Dasgupta and Stiglitz (1988) that potential competition, and even competition itself, may not
be sufficient to eliminate substantial market power in modern industries, especially those like healthcare and
drug manufacturing where considerable Research & Development (R&D) is required and prices are not fully
observable. In the current healthcare debate, understanding the role of competition and what it may and
may not be able to accomplish is fundamental, especially in brand name competition. Therefore, there is a
critical policy need to understand the role of brand name competition and potential competition to better
inform policies addressing prescription drug prices.
We contribute to this policy debate by studying the effect of potential competition on pricing decisions of
drug manufacturers under patent. Our analysis approaches this issue in two ways. First, we derive a model
of branded pharmaceutical price competition under tiered insurance for incumbent drugs facing uncertain
entry in the future. The intuition behind the model proposes that pharmaceutical firms have a long-term
revenue maximizing strategy, where uncertain entry introduces a tradeoff between current revenue and future
revenue. Branded drugs in the pipeline represent a kind of market exclusivity loss. Though an incumbent
will be the only producer of a certain drug, other drugs which can serve as a therapeutic substitute can eat
into the incumbent’s market share. It may be revenue maximizing, and therefore profit maximizing, for the

2

incumbent to raise prices now and offset some of the revenue loss due to market share loss if/when entry
occurs. This theoretical result relies largely on the incumbent manufacturer facing less elastic demand due
to insurance. The tiered structure of prescription drug coverage incentivizing the entrant to reference price
the incumbent’s current market prices and horizontal differentiation between drugs. The model predicts that
as the credible threat of entry increases, an incumbent drug manufacturer will increase price. It also allows
for an entrant with a vertically-differentiated product to price higher than existing drugs, and demonstrates
that following entry, price for the incumbent will decrease, but maintain a markup.
Second, we empirically test whether existing competitors adjust price in the presence of pipeline pressure,
focusing on a particular drug market without entry but with an increasing amount of potential entry insulin. This market provides a suitable natural experiment because there is no change in the composition
of incumbent’s over a span of several years, yet several potential entrants have new insulins in the drug
development pipeline. We use clinical trial results to exploit exogenous variation in a potential entrant’s
success in different phases of the pipeline, and consider the change in price in quarters following pipeline
shocks compared to quarters without pipeline shocks. Though the choice to start research & development
(R&D) in a particular market will be endogenous with price, neither the timing of clinical trials clearance nor
regulatory approval can be controlled by market participants. Therefore, the effect of competitive pressure
on prices of incumbent manufacturers can be identified using pipeline shocks. Results indicate that pipeline
shocks have significant effects on the price of incumbent insulins. Pipeline pressure significantly increases the
prices of incumbent drugs, and potential biosimilar entry may drive this effect. Furthermore, pipeline shocks
have cumulative effects. As the probability of entry of at least one or more new branded drugs increases,
the pipeline shock effect becomes stronger. Both the third and fourth pipeline shocks increase prices among
incumbent drugs by about $2.30 per shock. For the average patient taking about 12.48mL of insulin per
month, this corresponds to about 30 additional dollars. However, the quality of information about the shock
and the particular drug shock matters. In the insulin market, rising prices due to pipeline pressure are largely
driven by a branded biosimiliar in the pipeline. These results are robust to several specification checks.

1.1

Background and Literature Review
The Drug Approval Process

Drugs available for treatment undergo a rigorous process before they are prescribed to patients. The drug
approval process begins with pre-clinical research within a manufacturing firm. If a treatment provides

3

promising results from pre-clinical research, manufacturers submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, which is reviewed by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). If an IND
application is approved, manufacturers begin clinical trials with people. These clinical trials are broken
into three phases − Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 − where each subsequent phase indicates success in the
previous phase. If all three phases of clinical trials are successful, then a manufacturer submits a New Drug
Application (NDA) or Biologic License Application (BLA). The FDA reviews these applications and if a
drug successfully demonstrates safety and efficacy, the drug will be approved for use in the United States.1
Drug patents and/or exclusivity awards are critical in this market. Patents are granted by the United
States Patent and Trademark Office at any time, regardless of approval status, and carry a term of 20 years.
Exclusivity awards place a delay and prohibitions on the approval of competitor drugs. Exclusivity takes
effect once a drug receives FDA approval, with the longest possible exclusivity award, 7 years, applying
to orphan drugs. According to the FDA, “patents and exclusivity may or may not run concurrently and
may or may not cover the same aspects of the drug product.”2 Yet, both of these institutional awards
grant a drug manufacturer monopoly power, which provides the incentives for pharmaceutical companies
to invest in R&D for innovative treatments. Recent estimates of R&D costs per drug approval amount to
about $2.87 billion (DiMasi, Grabowski and Hansen 2016), so these awards are critical to incentivize these
incredibly risky investments. Most work studying the effect of entry on pharmaceutical prices focuses on
generic entry. Generic drugs are pharmacologically-identical to their brand-name counterpart drugs. They
have the same intended use, effects, side-effects, administration route, risks, safety, and dosage as the original
drug. Drugs manufacturers are protected from generic competition during patent/exclusivity periods. When
the period granted ends, a pharmaceutical product may face generic entry. However, drugs under the patent
and/or exclusivity period may face competition from other patented drugs which obtain the same or similar
therapeutic goal, but are not pharmacologically-identical to existing drugs, and therefore do not violate
patent and/or exclusivity rules.
We will refer to this type of competition as brand-to-brand, brand-name, or branded competition.
Note that in branded competition, it is possible to have both horizontally-differentiated and verticallydifferentiated products. Horizontally-differentiated drugs are different, but the choice of which drug depends
on the consumers preferences. Vertically-differentiated drugs are of different quality. Inn other words, drugs
are different and all consumers would prefer one drug over the other. The patent process does not require

that new drugs be vertically-differentiated. Manufacturers seeking FDA approval are only required to show
that the drug’s benefits outweigh its known risks and that the drug can be manufactured in a way that
ensures its quality. Drugs are not required to show that they perform “better” than existing drugs on the
market. Patents are awarded as long as the new drug has a formulation that is different from existing drugs.
Therefore, it is possible to observe both vertical differentiation and/or horizontal differentiation in branded
competition. “Me-too drugs” may be considered horizontally-differentiated drugs.
The amount of brand-to-brand competition an incumbent may face is considerably more uncertain than
the threat of generic entry. Studies report that the clinical success rate − the product of individual phase
transition probabilities for the clinical trials portion of drug development − is quite low, around one in ten
(Hay et al. 2014). However, estimates from various studies indicate that success in phase 3 ranges from 55
to 64 percent [Abrantes-Metz, Adams and Metz (2004); Kola and Landis (2004); DiMasi et al. (2010); Hay
et al. (2014)]. Thus, the credibility of the threat of entry increases considerably once a drug reaches phase
3. These studies also suggest that phase 3 success further increases the threat of entry. Estimates from the
same set of studies indicate that between 77 - 93 percent that successfully complete phase 3 studies move
on to NDA submission and approval.

1.2

Drug Price Competition

The economic field of industrial organization has extensively studied the game theoretic behavior of firms and
how incumbent firms anticipate and respond to entry (Tirole 1988). Theoretical work largely demonstrates
that under many circumstances entry − and even potential entry (Baumol, Panzar and Willig 1982) −
can drive markets to the efficient allocation of resources. In many ways, competition has generally been
regarded as a force which exerts “downward pressure on costs, reduces slack, provides incentives for the
efficient organization of production, and even drives innovation forward” (Nickell 1996). It has also been
largely regarded as a force to reduce price. Yet, theoretical work also suggests that there are a wide array
of anticompetitive strategies a firm can employ to deter entry (Salop 1979). This prompted a series of
econometric studies investigating the market effects of entry in various industries [Bresnahan and Reiss
(1991); Berry (1992); Bunch and Smiley (1992); Mazzeo (2002); Pakes, Ostrovsky and Berry (2007); Aghion
et al. (2009)]. The empirical work indicates that the incumbent response to entry is both mixed and selective
(Geroski 1995).
This econometric work has important implications for the prescription drug pricing debate. It is not
clear that competition, potential or actual, can be the silver bullet to the drug pricing dilemma. Research

5

following the passage of the 1984 Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act indicated
that generic competition was a driving effect in declining prices [Grabowski and Vernon (1992); Frank and
Salkever (1997); Morton (1999); and Reiffen and Ward (2005)], with a minor caveat that market size and
concentration may limit the speed and extent of the transition to lower priced generics (Tenn and Wendling
2014). Yet, this research also suggests that competition is not the only market incentive at play. Grabowski
and Vernon (1992), Frank and Salkever (1997), and Ching (2010) all contend that there is considerable
consumer heterogeneity in price-sensitivity which can produce differential effects on drug prices following
entry. Ching (2010) also suggests consumers learning plays a role and incumbent manufacturers have an
incentive to slowly raise prices, retaining as much market share as possible and slowing the learning process
about new drugs.
Furthermore, research has indicated a variety of factors influence the price of prescription drugs, mostly
factors that may mitigate the pressure from competition. Drug-level factors like innovation, the development
of drugs with therapeutic gains from greater efficacy and/or safety relative to existing drugs [Reekie (1978)
and Lu and Comanor (1998)], differentiation, both vertical and horizontal, and advertising increase drug
prices [Perloff, Suslow and Seguin (1995); Bhattacharya and Vogt (2003); Ching (2010)]. Institutional-level
factors like regulatory standards, patent protection, and market structure can also influence market efficiency
and price dynamics [Danzon and Chao (2000); Kyle (2007); Brekke, Canta and Staume (2016)]. Additionally,
the role of insurance as an institutional factor in drug pricing has largely been assumed away, despite a key
detail that nearly all prescription drugs are provided through health insurance plans. Nearly all Americans
obtaining health coverage through an employer have access to a plan with prescription drug coverage, and in
most cases the worker has coverage without first meeting a deductible (Claxton et al. 2016). In addition, over
89% of these plans have tiered prescription drug coverage (Claxton et al. 2016). It is clear that prescription
drug insurance will tie into consumer price-sensitivity [Lakdawalla and Sood (2009) and Berndt, McGuire
and Newhouse (2011)].
We suspect that typical prescription drug insurance plans largely eliminate patient price-sensitivity resulting in a lack of downward pressure on price. Specifically, we conjecture that under this institutional
structure, both incumbent drug manufacturers and potential entrants face a pricing decision under which
increasing price is the dominant strategy. We contribute to the existing literature on anticipating entry and
pharmaceutical competition in the following ways. First, we explore the effect of pressure in the pipeline on
prescription drugs. The aforementioned econometric work has focused on the effects of actual entry, because
it is not often possible to observe potential entry. However, in the case of pharmaceuticals, information from

6

the drug development pipeline is publicly available due to the Food and Drug Administration Modernization
Act (FDAMA) of 1997 requiring trial registry. Therefore, we can directly observe potential competitors in
the pipeline and identify the effect of the credible threat of entry on incumbent pricing strategies. Second, we
develop a two-period model of pricing strategies under tiered prescription drug insurance for an incumbent
drug manufacturer. The model predicts rising prices for incumbent drugs for a range of elasticities as the
likelihood of entry increases. Third, we econometrically assess pricing adjustments due to pipeline pressure,
using the insulin market as a natural experiment. Finally and perhaps most importantly, we contribute to
the growing assessments of pharmaceutical competition. Policy-makers may expect entry and competition
to improve consumer welfare, but we find evidence that this wishful thinking is unlikely to be true.

1.3

A Motivating Example: Insulin

Insulin is a life-saving drug used to treat diabetes.3 It helps patients maintain glycemic control and prevent and/or delay considerable complications and costs. On average, medical expenditures in the US are
approximately 2.3 times higher for patients with diabetes than those without, and it accounts for more than
1 in 5 health care dollars spent (Yang et al. 2013). Therefore, consistent treatment with insulin can be both
beneficial to patients and the US healthcare system. This particular drug is a biologic, originally discovered
and patented in the early 1920s, marking a monumental improvement in treating patients with diabetes.
In the last 95 years, incremental improvements in safety, efficacy, and convenience have characterized the
market for insulin. Older versions of insulin were derived from animal and human DNA. The newest version
of insulin which is derived from recombinant DNA (rDNA), the insulin analogue, was introduced on the U.S.
market in 1996. Animal and human insulins are considered somewhat inferior in both efficacy and safety to
insulin analogues,4 and used less frequently.
Recent research reports that the price of insulin has soared in the previous decade. Hua et al. (2016)
report that the price of insulin, measured as the mean price per milliliter, rose 197 percent from 2002
to 2013. Between 2007 and 2014, there were no new insulin analogues approved by regulatory agencies,
but there were several in pipeline development. Various insulins in drug development completed the final
phase of clinical trials and submitted national drug applications (NDAs) in the following quarters: 2009q1,
2011q3, 2013q4, 2014q2. Despite the rising threat of potential competition, Figure 1 depicts that the average
inflation-adjusted price of insulin per mL is increasing over time, from $14.67 at the beginning of 2007 to
3 It is the only treatment for type 1 diabetes, and is used as a second and/or third line therapy for type 2 diabetes when
other treatments are unsuccessful.
4 Insulin analogues both improved glycemic control and reduced the rate of adverse events in the form of severe hypoglycemia,
two life-threatening issues for patients with this condition, compared to earlier versions of insulin like animal and human.

7

Figure 1: Average Prices for all Insulin Prescriptions, 2007-2015
$61.22 by the end of 2015. On average, this is a 317.3 percent increase in the price of incumbent insulins.
The majority of these price increases were absorbed by payers, though this could be dampened by the size
of rebates. Payments made by patients increased by 56 percent.

Brand Name Drug Competition with Uncertain Entry

Consider a drug manufacturer in a two-period model facing uncertain entry in the second period. In the
first period, the drug manufacturer is a monopolist. This drug is a brand name drug under patent. Entry
in the second period is probabilistic. Therefore, the monopolist is referred to as the “incumbent” and
a new “entrant” firm may enter the market. If entry occurs, the entrant firm produces a branded drug
which is qualitatively similar to the incumbent’s product but considered to be an imperfect substitute.
This is because, the entrant’s drug may have limited information on effectiveness at regulatory approval,
while patients requiring treatment for this drug have experience with the incumbent’s drug for consumers.
Therefore, the differentiation between the incumbent’s and the entrant’s drug is horizontal and driven by
patient preferences, doctor preferences, or some other implicit preference to try the new treatment. After
observing price in the first period, there is some probability that entry occurs and both the incumbent and
entrant simultaneously set a price in the second period.
In the presence of insurance, the demand price faced by the consumer is vastly different from the market

8

price that a monopoly may set. In fact, in many cases an insurer would only charge a fixed copay from
the beneficiaries for a drug. The insurer pays the rest of the price. Berndt, McGuire and Newhouse (2011)
demonstrate that coinsurance makes demand less elastic and suggest that plans with fixed copayments will
result in even higher prices with price increases translated into higher premiums. Consequently, consumer
demand for this drug is inelastic, giving the monopolist an opportunity to set a price that can extract rents
from the market. This is unlike a traditional monopolist whose price is constrained directly by the elasticity
of consumers. The final price set by the monopolist would involve negotiations with the insurer so that
the price would preserve a non-negative profit margin for the insurer. For our purposes, we do not need to
explicitly consider the specific form of insurer constraint. Whatever it is, we acknowledge that it is used to
set equilibrium prices. Furthermore, we acknowledge that the presence of uncertainty, imperfect information,
and insurance can have a significant effect on markets as demonstrated by Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976)
and Arrow (1963). Without modeling these details, this model attempts to outline the incentives for a drug
manufacturer whose demand is largely supplied by insurance. Our goal is to see if the equilibrium price prior
to entry is influenced by other factors, especially pressure from the drug development pipeline, or potential
competition.

2.1

Extensive Form of the Two Period Model

There are two participants, the incumbent and the entrant. In the first period, the incumbent chooses
price. In the second period, both the entrant and the incumbent make a simultaneous choice on price. The
incumbent has complete but imperfect information about the likelihood of entry in the second period. Let
subscript i represent the incumbent firm and subscript e denote the entrant firm. In addition, let subscript
1, 2 denote the period of the game. Then, for example, term Ri is the incumbent’s revenue, and P1i , c1i ,
and Q1i denote the incumbent’s price, copayment, and quantity in the first period, respectively. There are
three formal assumptions that are required.
Assumption 1. Each product in the market is available to consumers at a constant demand price (for
example, a set copay) via insurance.
Assumption 2. Without loss of generality, marginal costs are zero for each drug.
Assumption 3. Drugs are homogenous in terms of clinical benefit. That is, they are therapeutically equivalent in treatment, but may exhibit other quality attributes that are more or less desirable according to patient
preferences.
9

Assumption 4. Under tiered prescription drug insurance, a lower price generates a more favorable tier
placement, and therefore a lower copay charged. That is, if the entrant sets a price Pe = γPi where γ ≤ 1,
and the copayment is a function of the fraction of price charged, ce = ce (γ), copayments can be anchored
at ce (0) = 0 and ce (1) = ci where setting price equivalent to the incumbent dictates that the two drugs be
placed on the same insurance tier. It follows that the elasticity of copayment with respect to price is linear,
∂ci
∂Pi

=

ci
Pi

and

∂ce
∂Pe

=

ce
Pe

in both periods.

In what follows, we solve for a Sub-game Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE) using backward induction (Selton
1965) and the aforementioned Assumptions. Therefore, we will first find best response functions, the optimal
strategy for a particular player given the strategies of other players, for both players in the second period,
and use these expectations to examine the pricing strategy for the incumbent in the first period.

2.2

Equilibrium Strategy for the Entrant

First, consider the equilibrium strategy for the entrant. Let price set by the entrant be P2e = γP2i where
γ ≤ 1 and denotes the fraction the entrant sets its price in reference to P2i . Let c2e = c2e (γ) where c2e
denotes the copayment that the insurer charges for the entrant’s drug in the second period. Naturally,
0

c2e (γ) ≤ c2i ∀γ and c2e =

∂c2e
∂γ

> 0, that is, a lower price of the entrant’s product would lead to the lower
0

copay charged. Let c2e (γ) be linear in γ. Since c2e (0) = 0 and c2e (1) = c2i , then c2e = c2i . It follows that for
both the incumbent and the entrant, the elasticity of copayment with respect to price is 1, that is,
and

∂ce
∂Pe

=

ce
Pe

∂ci
∂Pi

=

ci
Pi

in both periods. In the second period, if a new manufacturer gets regulatory approval to

enter the market with a qualitatively similar but imperfect substitute to the incumbent’s drug, the pricing
decision follows a simultaneous game where the incumbent and the entrant are trying to price their own
products anticipating competition from the other, albeit in the presence of insurance. Like the incumbent,
the entrant is also subject to the demand price separation due to insurance that protects it from the full
price-elasticity of consumer demand. Let the demand function for the entrant be given as

Q2e = a − b1 c2e + b2 c2i

(1)

where c2e and c2i are the copayments set for the entrant’s and incumbent’s drugs, respectively, by the insurer.
Here b1 captures the responsiveness of the entrant’s demand with respect to its own copayment, while b2
captures the responsiveness with respect to the incumbent’s copayment. a denotes the demand intercept
facing the entrant.

10

If the insurer covers both drugs at the same copayment level (i.e. c2e = c2i ), and there are no restrictions
set on which drug the patient chooses to take, switching to the entrant’s drug is determined entirely by
patient preferences, doctor preferences, or some other implicit preference to try the new treatment. Both
the incumbent and entrant drug can achieve the same treatment goal, but rather switching to the new
drug is determined by underlying preferences. Gaynor, Propper and Seiler (2016) and Santos, Gravelle
and Propper (2017) demonstrate that certain quality characteristics matter in this type of discrete choice
between products and/or providers in healthcare, specifically considering patient choice among hospitals in
the English National Health Service. As previously mentioned, we assume that products in this theoretical
model are horizontally differentiated, so that switching to the new drug is not driven by vertical differences
in quality. Let there be some portion, θ, of the population demanding treatment for this condition, Q, at
a copay of c2i who will switch to the entrant’s drug under these conditions, leaving a fraction (1 − θ) for
the incumbent’s demand. Therefore, following a linear inverse demand function for the entrant’s drug under
this condition is
Q2e = θQ = a − b1 c2i + b2 c2i =⇒ a = θQ + c2i (b1 − b2 )

(2)

Under such a scenario, there is no reason for the entrant to price its drug any differently than the current
prevalent price of the monopolist, i.e. P2e = P2i . This is because P2i is the maximum price the entrant can
charge in this simultaneous game, which maximizes its revenues since θQ is outside of entrant control.
However, since insurers often utilize a tiered system of copays to induce price elasticity of demand between
two products, the entrant will have a pricing decision at hand. Specifically, the entrant debates whether to
charge a lower price than P1i so that its product may be placed in a higher tier, (i.e. lower copayment) than
the monopolist incumbent’s product. Would the demand surge due to this favorable placement be enough
to overcome the shortfall in revenue due to the lower price? To answer this question, we solve the entrant’s
revenue maximization problem as follows. The entrant will maximize revenue in the second period, which
also maximizes profit. This is given by
max Re = P2e · Q2e
P2e

(3)

Substituting for Q2e using Equation 2, we can rewrite the entrant’s second-period problem as



max Re = P2e · Q2e = P2e a − b1 c2e + b2 c2i

Solving the entrant’s first-order condition with respect to P2e , setting this equal to zero, and solving for

11

P2e generates the best response function for the entrant. The best response function describes the optimal
strategy for a particular player, here the entrant, given the strategies of other players, here the incumbent.
To simplify the entrant’s best response function, we apply Assumption 4 and Equation 2 as well as requiring
that

c2e
P2e

=

c1i
P1i

and

c2i
P2i

=

c1i
P1i .

P2e =

θQP1i
1
+ P2i
2b1 c1i
2

(4)

Equation 4 displays the entrant’s best response function. Note that if θ = 0, that is, no one switches to the
entrant’s drug, the entrant prices the new drug at half the incumbent’s price. Notice also that this suggests
the entrant may increase price over the incumbent’s drug, if the market share gain is high relative to the
elasticity with respect to copay. In fact, if the entrant’s product is substantially differentiated vertically, and
therefore the entrant captures a larger share of demand, the entrant may price considerably higher than the
incumbent price.

2.3

Equilibrium Strategy for the Incumbent

The incumbent two-period decision problem is given as

max Ri = P1i · Q1i + E(R2i )

P1i ,P2i

(5)

where P , Q, and R denote price, quantity, and revenue, respectively. In drug manufacturing, fixed costs are
high and sunk, and marginal costs of production are low. Therefore, by Assumption 2, maximizing revenue
is equivalent to maximizing profit. Note that although the monopolist can set prices with certainty in the
first period and thereby determine revenue, it faces uncertainty about the second period stream of revenue
due to the potential entry of the entrant’s product. Let the probability of an entrant entering the market in
period 2 be denote by ρ. Hence the incumbent’s problem can be written as:



max Ri = P1i · Q1i + (1 − ρ)P1i · Q1i + ρP2i · Q2i

(6)

We can also find a best response function for the incumbent in the second period based on the entrant’s
best response. Like the entrant, the incumbent also faces demand separation. Let the inverse demand
function for the incumbent in the second period be given as

Q2i = α − β1 c2i + β2 c2e

12

(7)

From the demand function of the entrant, we know that if the copayments for both products are the same,
there is a shift of demand of θQ from the incumbent to the entrant for reasons other than demand prices. By
construction, this also means that there is no brand loyalty strategy that can alter the size of θ. Therefore,
at equal copay, (7) can be written as:

Q2i = (1 − θ)Q = α − β1 c2i + β2 c2e =⇒ α = (1 − θ)Q + c2i (β1 − β2 )

(8)

Next, we will find the incumbent’s best response function in the second period, using the entrant’s best response function. Since we are seeking an SPNE using backward induction, we must consider the incumbent’s
second period decision. The incumbent will maximize revenue in the second period given by



max P2i · Q2i = P2i · α − β1 c2i + β2 c2e

By simplifying using the entrant’s best response function from Equation 4 as well as

Equation 11 describes the incumbent’s best response function.
Theorem 1. Under Equations 4 and 11, the incumbent will raise its market price in period 1 if the probability
of an entrant entering the market in period 2 increases, i.e.

dP1i
dρ

> 0.

Recall the incumbent’s problem in Equation (6),



max Ri = P1i · Q1i + (1 − ρ)P1i · Q1i + ρP2i · Q2i

(12)

Replacing Q2i using Equation 7 and replacing Q1i assuming that Q1i = Q, i.e. the incumbent was meeting
the full demand in period 1 at the copay of c2i . Furthermore, the inverse demand function for the incumbent
in the first period is Q1i = α − β1 · c1i , where the elasticity of copayment with respect to price is 1 (following

Assumption 4), i.e.

∂c1i

Next, we differentiate the incumbent’s revenue with respect to price and set this equal to zero yields the
incumbent’s first-order condition with respect to P1i . After simplifying this expression, we have

2α − 4β1 c1i − αρ + ρ2β1 c1i = 0

(14)

This condition is based on both the entrant and the incumbent choosing optimal strategies according to the
SPNE. We are not necessarily concerned with the equilibrium, but rather how equilibrium pricing in the
first period changes as the probability of entry changes. In other words, when

dP1i
dρ

≥ 0, the incumbent will

increase price in the first-period as the probability of entry increases. To assess this, we use implicit function
differentiation. Therefore, the incumbent will raise first-period price as long as the following inequality is
true.
2β1 Pc1i

What conditions are required to observe this effect? Note that by definition 0 < ρ < 1, and 2β1 Pc1i
1i
so the numerator will be negative. Therefore, we must find conditions under which the denominator is
also negative, or when 2β1 c1i − α < 0. Recall that demand facing the incumbent in the first period is
Q1i = α − β1 · c1i . Elasticity for this demand curve is given by

For what elasticity will 2β1 c1i − α < 0 be true? Suppose elasticity for prescription drugs is 0.20 as indicated

14

in the RAND Health Insurance Experiment. Then,

ε=

β1 c1i
< 0.2
α − β1 c1i
β1 c1i < 0.2(α − β1 c1i )

β1 c1i + 0.2β1 c1i < 0.2α
1
β1 c1i − α < 0
6
1
2β1 c1i − α < 0
3
As long as α > 1, 2β1 c1i − 31 α < 0 =⇒ 2β1 c1i − α < 0. Since α is a demand intercept, this is almost
certainly the case. Therefore, the incumbent will increase price in the first period as the probability of entry
is increasing. In fact, we can verify that this condition will be satisfied as long as |ε| ≤ 1. Many prescription
drugs face relatively inelastic demand, especially those that are life-saving. Therefore, this range of elasticity
is likely to be satisfied, especially in the market we consider empirically. In what follows, we consider the
price effects of pipeline pressure in a particular drug market, insulin.

Empirical Strategy: Pipeline Pressure in the Insulin Market

News of potential competition in the pipeline becomes available as entrants clear various phases of drug development and publish the results from clinical trials. As each phase of development is cleared, the likelihood
of competing with at least one entrant increases, and incumbent firms may adjust their expectations about
future competition. This news from the pipeline serves as an exogenous shock to the existing market. The
completion of potential entrant clinical trials determine the timing of these shocks, not existing competitors.
Therefore, news of potential entry will be regressed on the prices of existing insulin drugs. We model price
as
Pit = αi + θ1 t + θ2 t2 + Qtr2,3,4 η + Xit β + PipelineShocksit δ + uit

(16)

where Pit is the price of drug i in quarter t, defined as average (median) payments for one mL supply. αi
are drug-level fixed effects which control for time-constant drug characteristics. This can include product
differentiation, like higher concentration insulins, characteristics that affect ease of use, and therapeutic gains
over existing drugs. t denotes time since the first phase 3 clearance of a potential competitor and captures
continuous trends in price. Qtr2,3,4 is equal to one in the second, third, and fourth quarters, respectively, of

the year which capture yearly cyclical trends in price. Xit includes market characteristics like the number
of quarters the drug was on the market at baseline, and the health plan type providing coverage. Length
of time on the market may also impact the pricing decision. More established brands may feel less pressure
if they have had an ample amount of time to build brand loyalty to their product. Bhattacharya and Vogt
(2003) establish this strategy, intended on increasing market share and improving brand loyalty to the drug,
prior to generic entry. uit is the idiosyncratic error, assumed to be independently and identically distributed.
Finally, PipelineShocksit is the main factor of interest in this analysis and represents exogenous shocks
from the drug development pipeline. In the initial specification, we consider the strongest signal of potential
entry, completion of phase 3 clinical trials. We use the first national drug application (NDA) submission to
mark successful completion of phase 3 trials.5 PipelineShocksit is a vector of a series of indicators which
mark each additional completion of Phase 3 by a new potential entrant.6 Table 8 in the Appendix lists all
the clinical trials on record for insulins in the clinical trials phase of development during our panel. Figure 2
depicts how the PipelineShocksit indicators are constructed for Phase 3 using information from Table 8.
Once a drug in development clears a particular phase, a new indicator is created and the indicator stays on,
i.e. is equal to one, for the remainder of the panel. Note that in some cases, information about more than
one drug in the pipeline comes out at the same time. Therefore, this information will be represented jointly
by one indicator, since separate effects cannot be estimated.
5 Both Tresiba and Ryzodeg 70 have an intial NDA submission, which is resubmitted in the first quarter of 2015. Existing
30
drug manufacturers will likely internalize the information from the initial NDA submission in their price setting strategy, so
the subsequent submission is not considered.
6 In other specifications, we also consider the informational shocks from Phase 1 and Phase 2.

Data

Data on insulin prices was obtained from Truven Marketscan Commercial and Medicare Claims from 20072015. This resource includes individual-specific healthcare enrollment, utilization, and expenditure data
from inpatient, outpatient, prescription drug, and carve-out services. MarketScan databases include both
commercial claims, and medicaid and medicare supplements. All claims from Truven Marketscan from
January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2015 with national drug codes (NDC) for all types of insulin were included
in this analysis. These NDCs are listed in Table 9 in the Appendix. Claims were included for all enrollees
regardless of age, insurance type, or diabetes type (diagnosis codes). We excluded claims where the enrollee
identification number was missing (less than one percent of claims), and claims that were not fully adjudicated
(less than 1.3 percent of claims).7 In addition, claims for other anti-hyperglycemic medications were not
included in this analysis.8 After implementing these criterion on all insulin claims, there are 28,801,450
claims. The vast majority of claims (28,388,234 claims or 98.56 percent of claims) are for incumbent drugs,
whose prices are considered in the analysis. In total, 87.2 percent of claims are for insulin analogues, the
most modern form of insulin.
The price, the main outcome of interest, was calculated as total expenditures per patient for a one
mililiter (mL) supply of each drug in each quarter adjusted for inflation using the urban consumer price
index (CPI). Expenditures include payments from patients (copayments and coinsurance) and payments
from the health plan. Health plan payments reflect a reduced payment after discounts are applied, but
before rebates are transferred. Patient prices for a thirty-day, one mL supply were also computed. These
patient prices include both copayments and coinsurance, depending on the construction of the health plan.
In most cases, only a copayment or coinsurance is required. Figure 3 depicts the distribution of insulin price.
Prices are considerably positively skewed with a long tail on the right hand side. However, over 95.9 percent
of prices are concentrated between 0 and 100. Sensitivity checks were conducted to determine whether this
significantly changes the results we obtain.
The following graphics derived from insulin claims are informative. Figure 4 depicts the frequency of
claims for insulin by health plan type.9 The majority of claims, 56.94 percent, are provided by PPO plans.
7 When a claim does not match on all required criteria, adjustments cannot be made. This is a very small portion of the
sample.
8 These drugs are not typically used to treat patients with type 1 diabetes and among patients with type 2 diabetes they
are used as a first-line treatment. Type 2 patients demanding insulin will likely have already tried these alternate therapies
without success, or they may use these drugs in conjunction with insulin.
9 There are nine health plan types: 1 − basic major medical, 2 − comprehensive (COMP), 3 − exclusive provider organization
(EPO), 4 − health maintenance organization (HMO), 5 − non-capitated point of service (Non-cap POS), 6 − preferred provider
organization (PPO), 7 − capitated or partially-capitated point-of-service (Cap or Part-Cap POS), 8 − consumer driven health
plan (CDHP), and 9 − high deductible health plan (HDHP).

17

Figure 3: Distribution of Insulin Price
The next most common plan providers are HMO plans, 16.42 percent, and comprehensive plans, 12.36
percent. Figure 5 depicts the frequency of claims for insulin by brand. The most commonly used insulin
brand is Lantus, 39.73 percent of all claims. Novolog and Humalog are the next most commonly used insulin
brands, 20.30 and 17.85 percent, respectively.
The claims data was supplemented with additional data on drug characteristics obtained from Redbook
and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Orangebook and Drugs@FDA database as well as information
about drugs in the development pipeline from the United States Clinical Trials Online Registry. Drug
attributes are matched to claims using the national drug code (NDC). Each national drug code identifies the
size in mililiters (mL), a description of the packaging, the strength in units per mL (U/mL), the mechanism
of action (peak, onset, and duration of the drug), and the insulin form (animal, human or analogue). We also
obtain information on patents for each drug, and the patent expiration date to identify loss of exclusivity.10
Finally, pipeline shock indicators described previously are constructed using information from the United
States Clinical Trials Online Registry and from the Drugs@FDA database. This information is consolidated
for this analysis and listed in Table 8 in the Appendix.
Table 1 presents summary statistics for variables used in the analysis which are partitioned by market
10 Of

all insulin products under patent, those with patent expirations prior to 2017 are discontinued. The earliest loss of
exclusivity of drugs considered here is June 20, 2017.

participation status. Incumbent drugs are insulins with approvals prior to the start of the panel. Entrant
drugs are insulins in stages of the drug development pipeline during the panel. The analysis which follows
considers only the prices of incumbent insulins, so the presentation of summary statistics for entrant insulins
is only for informational purposes. There are several intuitive and revealing insights from this segmentation.
First, median prices tend to be lower than average prices for both incumbent insulins and entrant insulins.
The average time on the market for incumbent insulins at baseline (2007q1) is 35.5 quarters, over 8 years,
and baseline time of the market for entrants is negative, by definition. Both prices and patient prices tend to
be higher for entering drugs compared to incumbent drugs, indicating that new products may be vertically
differentiated from existing products and therefore prices exhibit a markup. Market share tends to be higher
for incumbent drugs compared to entrants, whether it is calculated by National Drug Code or by brand. In
fact, the degree of market share loss immediately following entry in this market is quite low.

Results

5.1

The Effect of Pipeline Pressure on Incumbent Insulin Prices

Initial results are displayed in Table 2. All results were obtained using drug-level fixed effects linear regressions. The first column presents results obtained using the full sample, while the second and third columns
stratify by insulin type, analogue or human. There are less than 30 total claims for animal insulins, making
it impossible to assess effects on the pricing of insulins of this type. The direction of pipeline shock effects are
similar regardless of the sample considered, though there are minor differences in magnitude and significance.
Response to competitive pressure in the pipeline is stronger for insulin analogues than for human versions of
insulin. The first two shocks do not have a significant effect on price. However, the third and fourth shocks
significantly increase insulin price, specifically among analogues. The biggest price effect is concentrated
among insulin analogues. Prices are about $2.35 larger per mL in quarters following the third pipeline shock
compared to quarters prior to this shock. The fourth pipeline shock has an additionally positive effect on
price, increasing insulin price per mL by about $2.28 in quarters following this shock. For the average patient
in this sample taking 12.48 ml per month, this is an increase in the total amount paid for insulin of $29.33
due to the third shock and an additional $28.45 due to the final shock.
In general, price is increasing at an increasing rate over time, by about $1.34 per quarter at the mean
number of quarters since the first pipeline shock.11 Pipeline shocks reflect a shift in this more general time
trend. Since identification of the pipeline shocks relies on a correct specification of the time trend, we also
consider whether there is a systematic issue in the specification of the time trend by graphing the average
residuals over time, provided in Figure 7 in the Appendix. Results also indicate that there is no cyclical
dimension to pricing, that is, prices in later quarters are not significantly different than prices in the first
quarter of the year. Lastly, the health plan type has a considerable impact on price. All health plan types
covering insulin have lower prices than comprehensive health plans, with capitated or partially-capitated
POS plans, consumer driven health plans, high deductible health plans, and health maintenance organization
health plans having the biggest differences in price. This may be due to in part to plan structure, but could
also be due to levels of insurer bargaining power associated with each plan type. Growing literature on
insurer bargaining power and bargaining power in healthcare may contribute to our understanding of these
results [Ho and Lee (2017); Gaynor, Ho and Town (2015); Ho (2009); and Capps, Dranove and Satterthwaite
(2003)].

Table 3 provides estimates of the effect of pipeline news shocks on patient out-of-pocket costs. Pipeline
shocks have largely significant effects on patient prices, as price changes are passed on to consumers. All but
one of these pipeline shocks, the first, has a positive effect on price. The second, third, and fourth pipeline
shocks are associated with price increases of $0.14, $0.16, and $0.38, respectively, in quarters after the shocks.
All of these price effects are statistically significant at the one percent level, but significant responses are
mostly concentrated among insulin analogues. For the average patient in this sample taking 12.48 ml per
month, this is an increase in out-of-pocket costs for insulin of $1.74, $2.00, and $4.74, respectively, or a
total of $26.48 additional out-of-pocket costs over 8 years due to competition pressure from the pipeline. On
average, that’s an additional $3.31 per year.
The first pipeline shock decreases patient price following the shock by about $0.26. This result is also
statistically significant at the one percent level. This suggests that there may be something different about
the first pipeline shock. This market information shock represents Afrezza completing the last phase of drug
development has a significantly negative effect on price, but the rest of the pipeline shocks increase price.
This is likely due to the degree of product differentiation associated with Afrezza. Afrezza is an inhale-able
insulin, while the rest of the drugs on the market are injectables. This pipeline shock decreases out-of-pocket
costs by about $3.24 for the average patient in this sample, bringing the total change in patient costs due
to pipeline pressure to an increase of about $23.24 over 8 years. This also demonstrates that incumbent
manufacturers may have a holistic view of the probability of entry as indicated by information from the
pipeline. As more than one potential competitor completes phase 3, the probability that one of them will
eventually be successful increases. As demonstrated in the theory, manufacturers will increase price when
facing relatively inelastic demand in a setting where entry is becoming more likely.
Trends in patient prices are somewhat different than trends for total prices. Patient out-of-pocket costs
are lower for only a few plan types relative to comprehensive plans. This includes EPOs, HMOs, Capitated
or Partially-capitated POS, CDHPs, and HDHPs. High deductible plans are associated with the biggest
reduction in patient prices relative to comprehensive plans, which may demonstrate that patients in highdeductible plans are much more price sensitive than patients in other health plans. In addition, note that
quarter of the year effects have considerably significant effect on patient out-of-pocket costs. Patient prices
are significantly lower in the second, third, and fourth quarters relative to the first quarter of the year, and
patient out-of-pocket costs are lowest in the fourth quarter relative to the first quarter. This likely reflects
the decline in out-of-pocket costs as patients hit their deductible during the year.

Verifying Shock Exogeneity: Restricting the Analysis to External Firm Shocks

Incumbent insulins in our sample are only manufactured by three drug companies, Sanofi, Novo Nordisk, and
Eli Lilly. Each of these firms also has another insulin in development during our panel that clears various
phases of the drug development pipeline. In this market, an incumbent firm with a product in one category
of insulin may be in drug development for a different insulin in another category. We will consider the issue
of category and the definition of the market in detail in a later section. For now, let us only consider the
effect this may have on the exogeneity of the pipeline shocks. For a firm with both an incumbent drug and a
new drug in the development pipeline, the information about success in the pipeline will not necessarily be
a “shock” to this incumbent at all. Firms may internalize their success in the drug development pipeline as
they anticipate pricing effects from their new drug. Therefore, we also conduct firm-specific pipeline shock
tests. While it is reasonable to assume that external pipeline shocks, across firms, are exogenous, it is may
be inappropriate to assume that internal pipeline shocks, within firm, are exogenous. Therefore, we stratify
our sample at the firm-level, and consider only the shocks that are external to the firm. In other words, we
drop pipeline shocks from a firm’s own drug.
Table 4 presents results from firm-specific shock tests. Note that qualitatively, the impact of each shock is
qualitatively similar both in the full sample without regard to strict shock exogeneity and by firm, excluding
shocks which may be internalized. However, it is striking to note that Eli Lilly and Sanofi prices changes,
drive the results in the full sample. Eli Lilly increases prices by about $4.19 in quarters following the fourth
shock, and Sanofi increases prices by about $4.47 in quarters following the third shock. These effects are only
somewhat significant, at the ten and five percent levels, respectively. There is no significant change in prices
among Novo Nordisks insulin products in response to any of the pipeline shocks. It is worth considering how
each of these firms may view these pipeline shocks. The amount of competitive pressure associated with
pipeline shocks will likely depend on the degree to which these products are used as perfect and/or imperfect
substitutes in practice and whether or not they can also be used in complementary ways. Section 5.2 details
particular categories of these drugs to highlight the nature of competition in these markets.

5.1.2

Differential Effects by Plan Design − Copayment or Coinsurance

As discussed in the theoretical model presented previously, patients facing copayment for prescription drugs
tend to be less price sensitive than those facing coinsurance. In the insulin market considered here, 74.9
percent of claims for insulin require a copayment only. 16.7 percent of claims have no patient out-of-

pocket costs,12 neither copay nor coinsurance. The remaining 8.4 percent of claims is comprised mostly
of payments with coinsurance only (8.2 percent) and a combination of copayment and coinsurance (0.2
percent). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect less price sensitivity from consumers covered by a plan with
tiered copays instead of coinsurance. In this case, it may be advantageous to manufacturers to offer lower
prices to plans with coinsurance than those with copayments. We conduct another specification, allowing
prices to differ according to the structure of patient out-of-pocket costs. This will effectively serve as a proxy
to group patients by their price elasticity.
In general, the effect of pipeline shocks on both price and patient out-of-pocket costs is qualitatively
similar for both claims requiring a copayment and claims requiring coinsurance. However, the size and
significance of pipeline shock effects is larger and more significant for claims with coinsurance compared to
claims with copayment. This result is surprising, given that we postulated that patients under coinsurance
would be more price sensitive than those facing copayment. The positive effect on price from the third
shock is approximately $2.27 more among claims with coinsurance, and the positive effect on price from
the fourth shock is about $1.45 more among coinsurance claims. Manufacturers may offer bigger discounts
and/or different rebates for certain plans with copayment since they comprise a larger part of the market.
Unfortunately, drug-level rebates are proprietary and the size of discounts cannot be assessed with claims
data. This could also reflect a larger degree of bargaining power for the manufacturer compared to the
insurer among plans with coinsurance. Without additional data on these contractural arrangements, it is
unclear what may be driving this difference.

5.2

The Effect of Pipeline News on Insulin Prices by Category

The preliminary market definition is quite wide, and assumes that all insulin drugs compete with one
another. A narrow market definition would specify that insulin products only compete with one another
within category. We classify drugs into three market categories − bolus, basal, and mixed. This terminology
is derived from the medical terminology which indicates how an insulin is absorbed and metabolized by the
body. These categories are defined by three factors, onset, peak, and duration, of the drug. Bolus insulins
tend to have a quick onset, moderate peaks, and moderate durations. Basal insulins tend to have slow
onset, longer peaks, and longer durations. Mixed insulins typically contain both a bolus and basal insulin,
and have a quick onset, long peak, and long duration. These characteristics of incumbent and potential
entrant drugs are presented in Table 6. A range is provided because each drug formulation is absorbed

majority of these claims are for older versions of insulin provided at low costs.

somewhat differently, both between drugs and by different patients. For example, Humalog and Apidra
insulins have somewhat different peak, onsets, and durations, even though they are both used as “bolus”
insulins. Similarly, one patient may experience a rapid-acting insulin peak at one hour while another patient
experiences the peak at 1.5 hours using the same drug.
Within category, insulins can usually be substituted, with the caveat that counseling/education may be
needed to help assure adequate glucose coverage and safety in the transition. Between categories, it’s difficult
to specify the degree of substitutability as it may depend on an individual patient’s insulin sensitivity or
resistance as well as an individual patient’s treatment therapy. Therefore, it is possible that manufacturers
only see potential competitors “within category” as a competitive threat. Insulins “between categories” are
often used in complementary ways. For example, consider these two treatment options. A patient can use
long-acting insulin to provide basal glucose control in conjunction with a rapid-acting insulin to provide
bolus control. A patient can also use only rapid-acting insulin delivered in small increments throughout
the day to provide both basal and bolus control. Both treatment options can achieve the treatment goal
of glucose control. Figure 6 demonstrates that 61.81 percent of patients in the sample fill a prescription
for both a basal and bolus insulin, suggesting the majority of patients use these between category drugs as
complements.13
Phase 3 pipeline shocks were constructed similarly in this specification. Because only one bolus insulin
and one mix insulin were in the clinical trials phase of the drug development pipeline over this time frame,
13 See

Table 10 in the Appendix for number of claims.

29

Figure 6: Insulin Treatment Combinations
there is only one pipeline shock in each of these categories. There were three phase 3 pipeline shocks in
the basal category. Results from this specification are provided in Table 7. Note that the majority of the
large and significant effects are isolated in the basal category. This matches the theory where we see that an
increase in the probability of entry can drive escalating prices. Since the basal insulin category is the only
category in which more than one potential entrant successfully clears phase 3 of drug development, it may
be the only category where incumbent manufacturers have a large degree of confidence that probability of
entry is likely. This specification also reveals that the specifics of the shock may matter substantially. The
driving shock in the basal category is the Basaglar shock.

5.3

Other Robustness Checks

We test whether our results are robust to several other confounders that may affect the pricing decision.
Regardless of how these factors affect the pricing decision, it is unlikely that these factors are timed exactly to
the timing of drug development phase clearance. Therefore, we are not generally concerned about whether
the omission of these factors misidentifies the pipeline shocks. However, we run robustness checks for a
number of potential concerns. First, we control for supplemental indications for incumbent drugs, which
may increase price. Supplemental indications typically expand the number of patients that can be treated
with the drug by shifting the demand curve to the right. These supplemental indications also significantly
increase drug price, but previous estimates of the effect of pipeline shocks are robust to this specification.

Second, we test whether the passage of the BPCI in 2010 had a significant affect on price. Previous results
are also robust to this specification. Third, mail-order discounts, often for a 90-day supply, may also play a
role in pricing. To test for the robustness of the price effects of pipeline shocks, we also account for whether a
prescription was filled for 90 days or for 30 days. Price effects due to pipeline shocks are robust to this as well.
Fourth, estimated price effects are also robust to using the medical consumer price index to adjust prices
for inflation. Fifth, we also test a specification in which time trends differ at the brand-level to account for
differing within-brand pricing strategy trends. Price effects of pipeline shocks are robust to this robustness
check as well.
Sixth, we also consider whether pipeline shocks from earlier phases have similar effects. As previously
mentioned, the vast amount of uncertainty associated with drug development likely reduces the information
that an existing competitor can glean about potential competition from earlier phases. Price effects from
phase 3 pipeline shocks are robust to including pipeline shocks from phase 2 and phase 1. In addition, there
are no significant price effects from phase 2 or phase 1 pipeline shocks. Seventh, we evaluate whether results
are driven by outliers. Previous results are also robust to excluding outliers from the analysis, and nearly
identical in both magnitude and significance. An alternative approach to considering the role of outliers
would be to consider whether price responses at the median are the same as those on average, using quintile
regressions with fixed effects as illustrated in Powell (2014) and Powell and Wagner (2014). Unfortunately,
these methods are developed for panel data, and would require collapsing claims-level data into drug-level
panel data, loosing a considerable amount of price variation. Since results are robust to the exclusion of
outliers, it is unlikely that this approach will be informative. Lastly, we assess the role of Affordable Care
Act (ACA) demand expansion on these price increases. Recent work by Berndt, Conti and Murphy (2017)
finds both a reduction in the number of generic drug suppliers and an increase in the price of generic drugs
following the implementation of the ACA. To consider this effect, we reframe time trends to include a preACA and post-ACA time trend. Using pre- and post-ACA trends magnifies the size and significance of all
the pipeline shocks except for the third shock. The price effect from the third shock becomes insignificant,
though remains positive. The first and final shock increase price by $2.40 and $3.43, respectively, and are
both significant at the one percent level in this specification. Results from this specification are presented
in Table 11 in the Appendix.

5.4

Limitations

Despite rigorous considerations of these issues, there are other factors that may influence pricing strategies
that are either not observed or not considered in our empirical analysis. Drug-level rebate size and formulary
tier status, negotiated between manufacturers and payers using pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), are key
unobservables. If manufacturers truly compete over the size of the rebates to receive favorable status on
formulary tiers, and not over the payments or list price of their products, then this analysis may not correctly
measure the competitive effects of new branded drugs in the pipeline. Unfortunately, this information is
proprietary and it is not possible to estimate drug-level measures for either of these unobservables. The
database used in the analysis contains claims from over 100 payers, making it infeasible to obtain formulary
tier status or rebates at the drug-level. It may be possible to back out manufacturer-level rebate sizes,
but this will do little to assess the impact of rebate size or formulary status on the pricing decision. One
factor that is observable but not included in the analysis is research and development (R&D) costs. Though
research and development costs can be observed at the firm level and an approximate per drug R&D cost
can be estimated as in DiMasi, Grabowski and Hansen (2016), there is no way to isolate a drug-specific
R&D cost. In addition, it is unlikely to bias estimates on the effect of pipeline pressure. Research and
development costs are sunk costs and should not be considered in the pricing decision. However, research
and development costs do create a significant barrier to potential entry which thereby impacts competition
and the pricing decision. Therefore, these may both be limitations of the analysis, and therefore suggest
important areas of further research.

5.5

Policy Implications for Biosimilar Drugs

Our results suggest that potential biosimilar entry may be perceived differently than other branded therapeutic substitutes. Understanding the implications for these differences requires additional institutional
details. The pricing of large molecule drugs, or biologics, like insulin may differ from pricing decisions for
small molecule drugs. A biologic is a pharmaceutical drug product manufactured in, extracted from, or
semi-synthesized from biological sources. These large molecule drugs are more difficult to replicate, reducing
the likelihood that biosimilar entry will occur. According to the FDA, “a biosimilar is a biological product
that is highly similar to and has no clinically meaningful differences from an existing FDA-approved reference
product,” where the reference product is a biologic already approved by the FDA. A biosimilar must demonstrate that both its structure and function are similar to the reference product. It must also demonstrate
that there are “no clinically meaningful differences from the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and
33

potency (safety and efficacy).” For a biosimilar to be deemed “interchangeable” with a reference product,
it must meet additional requirements. Biosimilars are approved through a different abbreviated pathway
that avoids duplicating costly clinical trials. However, prior to 2010, there was no regulatory pathway for
biosimilar approval. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation (BPCI) Act of 2009 was signed into
law on March 23, 2010.
However, Basaglar is not approved as a biosimilar product. It was approved through an abbreviated
pathway after submitting a 505(b)(2) application (Food and Drug Administration 2015). This application
relied on comparisons of Basaglar and Lantus, a previously FDA-approved basal insulin, and FDA findings of safety and effectiveness for Lantus, or insulin glargine. According to the FDA, there is no insulin
glargine “reference product” under license with the Public Health Service Act. It is not clear whether the
manufacturer for Eli Lilly submitted a 505(b)(2) application because of this, or because studies for Basaglar
began prior to the BPCI approval. In addition, Basaglar’s FDA approval was delayed, due to a lawsuit
filed by the manufacturer of Lantus, which alleged numerous patent infringements.14 On the other hand,
Basaglar is considered a biosimilar by several European drug approval agencies. For these reasons, it would
be reasonable for an existing drug manufacturer to consider this product a biosimilar as it conducted clinical
trials in the pipeline. Therefore, it may also be reasonable to generalize our results as a typical response of
incumbents to potential biosimilar entry.
These details highlight two important issues that inform the outlook for drug pricing with the entry
of biosimilars. First, there may considerable legal battles over patent infringement for the entry of many
biosimilars, which will likely encourage additional upward pressure on price. Pharmaceutical companies,
both incumbents and entrants, will be incentivized to cover costs associated with funding these lawsuits
by raising price. Second, it is unclear whether drug manufacturers will pursue biosimilar entry or pursue
alternative abbreviated pathways, such as the 505(b)(2). Basaglar did not conduct phase 2 clinical trials, as
illustrated in Table 8. If other abbreviated pathways can cut the costs of R&D, it may be more advantageous
to pursue those pathways. Finally, biosimilar entry may not be profitable if the market is saturated by enough
branded biologic substitutes. It is still too early to assess whether there will be a large degree of biosimilar
entry, actual or potential, and whether that competition will be enough to exert downward pressure on
price. Our results seem to suggest that given the institutional structure, potential biosimilar entry or other
follow-on entry could encourage incumbent drugs to increase price. However, this would require significant
reconsideration, as our model demonstrating this price increase incentive is partially driven by the share

θ that switch to the new product. In the case of a biosimilar that is “interchangeable” with a reference
product, a patient may be switched to the biosimiliar in part due to price. In this case, the market share
loss following biosimilar entry may be greater than we assess, possibly off-setting the potential revenue gains
from increasing price in the first period. For the curious reader, our model could be extended to structure θ
as a function of price or copayment which could help assess the competitive effects of biosimilar entry.

Conclusion

In this study, we demonstrate both a strategic incentive for incumbent firms under patent to raise drug prices
as the likelihood of competition from another brand name patented drug increases, both theoretically and
empirically. Results suggest that pipeline pressure significantly increases the prices of incumbent drugs, and
potential biosimilar entry may drive this effect. Specifically, prices for insulin increase by around $30 per
patient for each of the later pipeline shocks in our analysis. However, this incentive explains a little less than
10 percent of the price increases observed from 2007-2015. Therefore, there is considerable work to be done
to assess the role of manufacturer-insurer bargaining power, and other important market characteristics like
drug rebates and formulary tier status that likely play a role in increasing prices. Future work should also
consider the differential welfare impact on patients with high deductibles and larger out-of-pocket costs and
patients without insurance.
