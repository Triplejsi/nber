ABSTRACT
We study the impact of pollution on the migration of high human capital employees. We link data
on the opening of toxic-emitting plants with the career paths of executives at S&P 1500 firms.
We discover that toxic-emitting plant openings increase executive departures from neighboring
firms with adverse effects on stock prices. The results: are larger when polluting plants and firms
are geographically closer, hold only for executives physically-based at treated firms, hold only for
the opening of polluting plants, do not reflect other local factors or prior stock price performance,
and are larger among executives with more general human capital.

1. Introduction
Pollution imposes costly externalities. Exposure to toxic pollutants increases infant
mortality, neurodevelopmental disorders, respiratory and cardiovascular disease, cancer rates,
and premature death.1 The World Health Organization (2016) attributes about one in six
deaths to air pollution. According to the American Lung Association (2019), more than 40%
of the U.S. population lives in counties with unhealthful levels of air pollution. Consequently,
researchers examine the impact of environmental protection regulations on health, economic
activity, and business profitability (e.g., Becker and Henderson 2000; Greenstone 2002;
Krueger, Sautner, and Starks 2019).
In this paper, we examine an additional potential consequence of pollution: The
migration of highly-valued employees from firms that are geographically close to polluting
plants. Given that exposure to toxic pollutants has adverse health effects, the opening of a
toxic emitting plant could trigger the migration of workers from neighboring firms and this
migration could harm the firm from which they are separating. While research shows that
people migrate away from polluted areas (Chen, Oliva, and Zhan 2017) and shareholders,
households, firms, and markets react to environmental factors (e.g., Flammer 2013; Agarwal
Sing, and Yang 2019; Agarwal, Wang, and Yang 2019; Chang et al. 2019; Li, Massa, Zhang,
and Zhang 2019), we are unaware of systematic research into the impact of pollution on the
migration of highly-valued employees and the resultant effects of those separations on their
former firms.
To evaluate the impact of pollution on human capital migration and the stock
market’s reaction to those departures, we focus on corporate executives. We focus on
executives—and not on employees more generally—for two reasons. First, executives exert a
significant impact on corporate policies and performance (e.g., Bertrand and Schoar 2003;
Kaplan, Klebanov and Sorensen 2012; Graham, Harvey and Puri 2013; Pan, Wang, and
Weisbach 2015, 2016; Pan 2017). Second, we can trace the career paths of executives over

See, Chay and Greenstone (2003), Currie and Neidell (2005), Knittel, Miller, and Sanders (2016), Schlenker
and Walker (2016), Isen, Rossin-Slater, and Walker (2017), Qian et al. (2017), and Landrigan et al. (2017) and
Agarwal, Deng, and Li (2019).

time and across corporations. Thus, we ask: When a plant starts emitting toxic pollutants,
does this trigger executives in neighboring firms to leave and migrate to areas with less
pollution, and are these executive departures associated with a drop in firm value? By linking
environmental economics with corporate finance, we provide additional evidence on the
effects of pollution.
To address these questions, we create a unique database on the career paths of
executives and combine several datasets on toxic emissions. First, we assemble data on the
career paths for all executives at S&P 1500 firms over the period from 2000 through 2014
from BoardEx and ExecuComp. Thus, we know where executives work, when they depart,
and to which firms they migrate. Second, we identify plants that emit airborne toxic
pollutants using the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) Toxic Release Inventory
(TRI) program. Since 1986, the Emergency Planning, Community Right to Know Act
requires that plants in particular industries that use specific toxic chemicals in sufficient
quantities and that have ten or more full-time equivalent employees report their emissions of
TRI-listed toxins. Third, to obtain precise information on the opening and location of these
TRI-plants, we match data from the EPA’s TRI program with National Establishment TimeSeries (NETS) data, which contains information on the universe of U.S. establishments (over
58.8 million) during the past two decades. The matched sample yields the exact location and
opening dates of 48,317 TRI plants. Fourth, we use data from EPA outdoor monitors on the
concentration of airborne pollutants. Critically, we show that TRI plant openings are
associated with a material increase in airborne pollutants close to those new TRI plants.
The key challenge to identifying the impact of toxic emissions on executive migration
is omitted variable bias. An omitted factor could account for both toxic emissions in a locality
and executive migration from that locality, potentially leading to spurious inferences about
the impact of pollution on executive migration. We use a series of empirical strategies—
including differentiating among executives within the same firm—to address this concern. In
the first part of our analyses, we focus on firms and assess whether the opening of toxic
emitting plants induces executives at neighboring firms to leave those firms. The second part

2

of our analyses focuses on individual executives. We evaluate whether an executive is more
likely to separate from a firm with greater exposure to toxic emitting plants.
We begin our firm-level analyses by examining the impact of TRI plant openings on
the percentage of executives who leave geographically close firms.2 In these analyses, the
dependent variable is the percentage of executives who separate from an S&P 1500 firm one
or two years after the TRI plant opening. The main explanatory variable measures the degree
to which the S&P 1500 firm is exposed to TRI plant openings. To measure exposure, we use
indicators of whether a TRI plant opens within one (or two) miles of an S&P 1500 firm.
Critically, the regressions control for city-year effects, so that we are comparing S&P 1500
firms within the same city and year that are differentially exposed to TRI plant openings due
to their distance from the plant. The regressions also control for (a) industry-year fixed
effects since industries might concentrate geographically and have distinct pollution and
executive migration tendencies, (b) firm fixed effects, and (c) time-varying firm traits, e.g.,
firm size, growth, leverage, and cash-flow volatility.
We find that exposure to TRI plant openings is associated with a sharp increase in
executive migration. The firm-level analyses indicate that TRI plant openings are associated
with a material increase in the percentage of executives who leave neighboring S&P 1500
firms. For example, the estimates indicate that if one TRI plant opens within one mile of an
S&P 1500 firm, the proportion of executives who leave during the next year rises by 4.2%,
which is large since only 12% of executives leave the average firm each year. Although these
analyses control for city-year fixed effects—as well as assortment of other controls, we were
concerned that there might be time-varying, within-city local factors that trigger both
executive separations and the opening of TRI plants. Consequently, we extend the analyses.
Building on these firm-level analyses, we employ several strategies to better identify
the impact of the exposure of executives to air pollution on their decisions to migrate. First,
we exploit the distance between the firm and the new toxic-emitting TRI plant. As discussed
in Currie et al. (2015), the density of air pollution dissipates with distance. Thus, if exposure
to toxic pollutants triggers executive migration, then the impact of TRI plants on executive
2

Currie et al (2015) evaluate the impact of TRI plant openings on housing prices.

3

migration should be larger for firms that are geographically closer to the new TRI plants. This
is what we find. For example, there is no relationship between executive migration from a
firm and TRI plants opening between two to five miles of the firm and the estimated impact
of TRI plant openings on executive migrations is twice as large for TRI plant openings within
one mile of the firm as for plant openings between one and two miles from the firm.
Second, we implement a placebo test that focuses on corporate leaders who are not
physically based at the firm. If a firm’s leaders migrate because they are exposed to pollution
from a neighboring TRI plant, then leaders who are physically present at their firms should be
more likely to leave than those who are typically not physically present at those firms. To test
this, we examine non-executive directors, leaders who are less likely than executives to be
physically present at the firm on a regular basis. Consistent with the view that physical
exposure to toxic air pollutants triggers executive migration, we find no relationship between
TRI plant openings and the migration of non-executive directors from neighboring firms.
Third, we implement a different placebo test by examining the impact of non-TRI
plant openings on the rate of executive migration from neighboring firms. If exposure to
pollution drives the results on executive migration, then we should not find executive
migration from S&P 1500 firms when non-TRI plants open close by. That is, if migration is
caused by pollution emitted by TRI plant openings—and not by some other factor associated
with new plant formation, then the opening of non-TRI plants should not trigger executive
migration from geographically close firms. Consistent with the view the exposure to pollution
drives executive migration, we find no evidence that the opening of non-TRI plants induces
executive from neighboring firms to leave.
Fourth, we were concerned that TRI plant openings might be more likely to occur
around failing S&P 1500 firms and failing firms are more likely to fire executives. Although
our findings that geographic proximity down to a mile and the placebo test of non-executive
directors mitigate such concerns, we can also directly address concerns about firm
performance. Specifically, we eliminate S&P 1500 firms that were performing poorly during
the year prior to TRI plants opening close to those firms. If the earlier results were driven by
poor firm performance driving both executive migration and TRI plant openings, then the
4

results should weaken after we exclude poorly performing firms. This is not what we find.
Even when eliminating poorly performing firms, the results hold and the estimated
coefficients are very similar. This is consistent with the view that exposure to pollution, not
prior firm performance, accounts for the findings.
Fifth, we employ both propensity score matching and nearest neighbor matching
algorithms to estimate the impact of the opening of a TRI plant on the migration of
executives from geographically close firms. That is, we match each “treated” firm, i.e., each
firm exposed to the opening of TRI plant, with otherwise similar control firms using these
matching algorithms. We then compare the frequency of executive separations in the treated
and control groups. The results from using both matching techniques confirm the earlier
findings: TRI plant openings increase the rate at which executives leave treated firms.
In the second part of our analyses, we focus on individual executives. Rather, than
testing whether TRI plant openings increase the percentage of executives who leave
geographically close firms, we now assess whether an executive is more likely to separate
from a firm with greater exposure to TRI plant openings. To conduct this assessment, we use
a linear probability model where the dependent variable is an indicator variable that equals
one if the executive leaves the firm during the next year (or two). The main explanatory
variable is again a measure of firm exposure to TRI plant openings. In addition to including
all of the control variables employed in the firm-year analyses, these individual-level
analyses also control for individual fixed effects as well as the executive’s age and tenure
with the firm. Moving to individual-year analyses focuses on the separation experiences of
individual executives and allows us to condition out all time-invariant executive traits.
The results from these individual-level analyses confirm the firm-level findings:
executives are more likely to leave their firms when a TRI plant opens close to them. The
estimated effects are large. If one TRI plant opens within one mile of an executive’s firm, our
estimates indicate this increases the probability that the executive leaves the firm during the
next year by about 5%. This is large, as only about 13% of executives leave firms over the
average year.

5

To address additional identification concerns, we differentiate among executives
within the same firm by the degree to which they have general human capital skills—skills
that are valued by other firms. Specifically, if the results are driven by exposure to toxic air
pollutants, then we expect that executives with more general human capital skills—and
therefore executives that are likely to have comparatively appealing employment options in
less polluted areas—should be more likely to separate from firms exposed to TRI plant
openings than executives with more firm-specific human capital skills. This is what we find.
Using Custodio, Ferreira and Matos’s (2013) measure of the degree to which an executive’s
skills are transferrable across firms and industries, we find that exposure to TRI plant
openings is associated with greater migration of executives with more general human capital
skills. By examining whether executives with different human capital skills within the same
firm respond differently to the same TRI plant openings, we reduce concerns that an omitted
variable is biasing our results, as any such variable would also have to account for this
differential response.
Finally, we extend the analyses to shed additional light on the mechanisms linking
pollution and executive migration. First, one interpretation of our findings is that TRI plant
openings increase pollution and this pollution prompts executives to leave; that is, these
executive separations are triggered by pollution, not by poor executive performance. This
interpretation implies that executive departures from firms exposed to TRI plant openings
should reduce the stock prices of those firms. This is what we find. Firms’ cumulative
abnormal returns (CARs) fall markedly when executives announce their departures following
geographical close TRI plant openings—and the drop in CARs associated with executive
departures following TRI-plant openings is much greater than the drop associated with
executive departures from firms unexposed to TRI-plant openings. This is consistent with the
view that voluntary executive resignations (from greater pollution) have more adverse effects
on stock prices than forced executive departures (e.g., Warner, Watts and Wruck 1988, and
Denis and Denis 1995). Second, the view that toxic emissions encourage executive migration
also has predictions about where those executives go. If executives leave S&P 1500 firms
because of pollution or other nonmonetary factors, then we should observe these executives
6

moving to firms in less polluted areas (e.g., Deng and Gao (2013) on the quality of life as a
component of executive compensation. We confirm this prediction: Executives who leave
S&P 1500 firms after TRI plant openings systematically move to firms in less polluted locals.
Our examination relates to research on the degree to which people “vote with their
feet” (e.g., Tiebout 1956; Banzhaf and Walsh 2008). For example, Moretti and Wilson (2017)
show that U.S. state corporate taxes shape the migration patterns of star scientists, Giroud and
Rauh (2019) explores how U.S. state corporate and individual taxes affect the reallocation of
workers and businesses, and Kleven, Landais and Saez (2013), Kleven, Landais, Saez and
Schultz (2014), and Akcigit, Baslandze and Stantcheva (2016) examine the international
migration of highly skilled individuals in response to differences in personal income tax rates.
In our paper, we quantify (a) the sensitivity of the migration of corporate executives to TRI
plant openings that emit toxic air pollutants and (b) the impact of these executive departures
on corporate valuations. By documenting these findings, our research also adds to the
literature on executive turnover (e.g., Warner, Watts and Wruck 1988; Weisbach 1995) and
the reallocation of talent within firms (e.g. Giroud and Mueller 2015).
Our work also contributes to research on the political economy of environmental
regulations and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Research examines how different
interest groups compete in shaping environmental policies (e.g., Baumol and Oates 1988;
Oates and Portney 2003). Our results indicate that corporations exposed to the toxic
emissions of other plants experience costs in terms of the migration of high human capital
individuals and stock price reductions. These costs could factor into cost-benefit assessments
of environmental regulations and the formation of corporate interest groups favoring stricter
environmental laws. Research also explores why firms adopt environment management
practices beyond regulatory requirements (e.g. Delmas and Toffel (2004, 2008) Reid and
Toffel (2009) and the connections between CSR, corporate performance, and national
policies (e.g., Flammer 2015a, 2015b; Krueger 2015; De Haas and Popov 2019). Our work
adds to this line of research by suggesting a connection between a major public health
concern, toxic air pollution, and the stock price performance of non-polluting firms.

Data, Variable Construction, and Descriptive Analyses
2.1.

Toxics Release Inventory Plants, Monitors, and NETS Data

The EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) program mandates that all U.S. plants that
meet specific criteria report how much of each toxic chemical they release into the air, water,
or soil in each year. The EPA mandates that any plant that (1) manufactures, processes, or
otherwise uses a TRI-listed chemical in quantities above threshold levels in a given year, (2)
has 10 or more full-time equivalent employees, and (3) is in the mining, utility,
manufacturing, publishing, hazardous waste, or federal industry must report the emissions of
each TRI-listed toxic chemical. The TRI program makes this information publicly available,
along with the latitude and longitude of each TRI plant.
To determine the year when a TRI plant opened, we augment the EPA’s data. In
particular, a plant enters the TRI database in the year that it meets all three criteria mentioned
above. However, a plant could be emitting toxic pollutants before it enters the TRI database
but only enters the TRI database, for example, after it has ten employees. Thus, to establish
the year when the TRI plant began operations, we merge the EPA’s TRI database with the
National Establishment Time-Series (NETS) data. NETS provides data on U.S. plants and
their parent companies, including the year when each plant was established, the geographic
location of each plant, as well as data on sales, number of employees, ownership, etc. The
NETS dataset has information on over 58.8 million U.S. establishment-year observations
during the past two decades. The matched TRI-NETS dataset allows us to infer the opening
year of each TRI plant.3 Given the other data in our analyses, we use data on the opening of
TRI plants from 2000 through 2014.
The EPA also provides annual data on pollutant density as recorded by each of its air
monitors. A single air monitor records the density of multiple pollutants at a fixed location
every hour. We compute the average hourly density of each pollutant at each monitor over
each year. These monitors have the capacity to record 894 different pollutants, but every
3

There might be concerns that a plant was operating for several years and only started emitting toxic pollutants
in the year that it entered the TRI program. In this case, it would be inappropriate to use the date from NETS
when the plant was first established. Consequently, we have conducted all of the analyses using the date when a
plant first appears in the TRI database and obtain very similar parameter estimates and p-values.

8

monitor does not record every pollutant every year. Therefore, we examine the most heavily
monitored pollutants. Specifically, we sort the pollutants by how often they are monitored
across all monitor-year observations and select the top 10 pollutants: PM10 Total 0-10um
STP (STP: standard temperature and pressure), Suspended Particulate (TSP: total suspended
particulates), Carbon monoxide, Ozone, Lead (TSP) STP, Sulfur dioxide, Benzene, Toluene,
PM10 – LC (LC: local conditions), and Ethylbenzene. The EPA provides the latitude and
longitude of each monitor.
2.2.

S&P 1500 Firms

We follow the career paths of all executives at S&P 1500 firms between 2000 and
2014. We obtain data on executives in each year from BoardEx and ExecuComp. By
comparing the lists in successive years, we identify those executives who leave and join firms.
We also collect information on each executive over time, including age, experience, tenure in
each firm, positions in the firm (e.g., CEO, chair of the board, etc.). In this way, we trace out
the career paths of each executive over time and across S&P 1500 firms.
We assemble detailed data on all S&P 1500 firms from different data sources. From
the Compustat database, we obtain Total Assets, Leverage (liabilities/total assets), Operating
Cash Flow / Total Assets, Sales Growth, Cash Flow Volatility (standard deviation of cash
flows during the last five years). We identify the historical address of each firm’s
headquarters using several databases. We start from the database compiled by McDonald and
Yun, who have parsed all of the fields appearing in headers for 10-K forms (available on the
SEC’s EDGAR website) to determine the precise historical location of each listed firm’s
headquarters. 4 For firms that are not in the McDonald and Yun database, we use the
Compustat Snapshot database and WRDS SEC Analytics Suite to determine historical
locations. Because the SEC did not require electronic filings that contain the street and city
address of each corporation’s headquarters until May 1996, our sample starts then. From the
address, we compute longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates.

2.3.

TRI Plant Openings Near S&P Firms

We construct and examine two time-varying measures of the exposure of S&P 1500
firms to toxins emitted by the opening of TRI. First, TRI Open within 1 Milef,t equals one if
there is at least one TRI plant opening within one mile of S&P1500 firm f in year t and zero
otherwise, where the TRI plant is not owned by S&P1500 firm f. Second, TRI Open within 2
Milesf,t equals one if there is at least one TRI plant opening within two miles of S&P1500
firm f in year t and zero otherwise, where again the TRI plant is not owned by the S&P1500
firm f. As a robustness test, we also confirm that the results hold when using alternative
measures of the geographic proximity of TRI plant openings to S&P 1500 firms. In particular,
we confirm the paper’s findings when using either the number of TRI plant openings or the
distance-weighted number of TRI plant openings, where each opening is weighted by the
inverse of the distance between the TRI plant and the S&P 1500 firm.
2.4.

Descriptive Information

Table 1 provides detailed variable definitions, Table 2 gives summary statistics, and
Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of TRI plants across the United States. It includes plants
that opened at some point since 1996. Plants are largely distributed in the New York, Boston,
Chicago, and Detroit metropolitan areas. Other areas with a high density of plants include
Atlanta, Charlotte, Minneapolis, Salt Lake City, Phoenix, Denver, Houston, Dallas, Seattle,
Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Tampa, and Orlando. There are approximately 2,000 –
4,000 openings and closings each year. The total number of plants remains relatively stable at
between 22,000 and 25,000, with no clear trend over time.

Empirical Results
3.1.

Effect of TRI Plant Openings on Major Pollutants

Before assessing the impact of TRI plant openings on the separation of executives
from geographically close S&P 1500 firms, we first establish that TRI plant openings are
associated with increases in air pollution near those plants.

10

To conduct this examination, we construct time-series measures of the density (in
nanograms/m3) of different air pollutants at air monitors close to each TRI plant. Specifically,
for each monitor in each year, we identify all TRI plant locations within one or two miles.
For each of these monitor-plant pairs in each year, we assign the density of the pollutants
recorded by the relevant air monitor, so that we have multiple observations for each TRI plant
in a year when there is more than one monitor within one or two miles of the plant. If two
TRI plants are within one or two miles of the same monitor, we assign each of these monitorplant pairs the same pollutant density. Thus, we define pm,l,t as the density of pollutant p
measured at monitor m that is within one or two miles of plant l in year t.
Given these data, we estimate the following regression,
𝑝!,!,! = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝐷𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑦 𝑃𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑖𝑠 𝑂𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔

!,!

+ 𝛿! + 𝛿!,! + 𝜀!,!,! ,

(1)

where 𝛼 is a constant, the main explanatory variable, Dummy (Plant is Operating), is a
dummy variable that equals zero in the years before a TRI plant opens and one afterwards,
the regression controls for year fixed effects (𝛿! ) and monitor-plant fixed effects (𝛿!,! ), and
𝜀!,!,! is the error term. The estimated value of 𝛽 provides information on the impact of a TRI
plant opening on pollution levels at monitors within one or two miles of the plant. Table 3
reports the results of ten regressions, one for each pollutant.
Table 3 shows that TRI plant openings induce a statistically significant and
economically large increase in pollution. The TRI plant openings trigger an increase in each
of the specific air pollutants, as measured by air pollution monitors within both one and two
miles of the plant, except for lead. The last column of Table 3 provides information on the
economic magnitudes of the estimated coefficient on Dummy (Plant is Operating) for each
pollutant by computing the estimated change in the pollutant as a percentage of the
pollutant’s average across all monitors in the country. For example, when examining the
toxin Benzene within two miles of a plant, the estimated coefficients indicate that a TRI plant
opening is associated with an increase of 9.69 nanograms/m3 of lead in the air, which is 18.3%
of the mean density of lead recorded by an average monitor.

3.2.

TRI Plant Openings and Executives Migration: Firm-year Analyses

We next examine the relationship between TRI plant openings and the percentage of
executives who leave neighboring S&P 1500 firms. As noted above, these TRI plant
openings do not include plants owned by the neighboring S&P 1500 firm. For brevity, we
refer to S&P 1500 firms as “firms,” and use the designator “f.” The dependent variable in
!
these firm-year regressions is either (1) 𝐸!,!
: the percentage of executives who leave firm f

during year t, (i.e., the number of executives who leave the S&P 1500 firm between the end
of year t-1 and the end of year t divided by the total number of executives in that firm, f, at
!
the end of year t-1) or (2) 𝐸!,!
: the percentage of executives who leave firm f during years t

and t+1 (i.e., the number of executives who leave the firm during the two years between the
end of t-1 and the end of t+1 divided by the total number of executives in f at the end of year
t-1).
Thus, we estimate the following regression:
!
= 𝛼 + 𝛾𝑇𝑅𝐼 𝑂𝑝𝑒𝑛!,! + 𝜃𝑿!,! + 𝛿!,! + 𝛿!,! + 𝛿! + 𝜖!,! , (2)
𝐸!,!
!
!
where the dependent variable is either 𝐸!,!
or 𝐸!,!
, and TRI Openf,t is one of the two

time-varying measures of the exposure of S&P1500 firms to toxins emitted by the opening of
TRI plants: TRI Open within 1 Milef,t or TRI Open within 2 Milesf,t, 𝑿!,! represents the
following characteristics of S&P 1500 firm f in year t: Total Assets, Leverage, Operating
Cash Flow / Total Assets Ratio, Sales Growth, and Cash Flow Volatility. We show that the
results are robust to excluding or including these time-varying firm traits. All regressions also
control for city-year (𝛿!,! ), industry-year (𝛿!,! ), and firm 𝛿! fixed effects, where we use the
headquarter city (c) and the industry (k) of firm f.5 Standard errors are double clustered at the
city and year levels.6
This specification addresses three potential concerns with identifying the impact of
TRI plant openings on the proportion of executives who depart from firms geographically
close to the toxic emitters. First, there might be concerns that (a) businesses choose to open
5

All of the results hold when using Metropolitan Statistical Area-year fixed effects instead of city-year effects.
The city-year analyses are more granular, as the average city is only 25 square miles. There are 552 cities with
at least one S&P 1500 headquarters, 226 cities with two or more headquarters, and 69 with five or more.

12

toxic emitting plants in economically depressed localities and (b) executives are more likely
to separate from firms in economically declining areas, so that any relationship between TRI
plant openings and executive migration reflects something about local economic conditions
and not the impact of pollution from TRI plant openings on executive separation decisions.
Thus, we control for city-year fixed effects. By including city-year effects, we compare S&P
1500 firms within the same city and year that are differentially exposed to TRI plant openings.
That said, there might be concerns that omitted within-city factors account both for where
businesses open toxic emitting plants and executive migration from firms. We address such
omitted variable concerns below.
Second, there might be concerns that time-varying industry characteristics explain
both the increases of executive turnover and pollution. If particular industries congregate
geographically and have different distinct pollution and executive turnover patterns, then this
could impede our ability to draw inferences about the impact of TRI plant openings on
executive migration. Although city-year fixed effects will help address this concern,
industries might congregate geographically even within cities. Thus, we control for industryyear fixed effects to further reduce concerns that omitted factors, e.g., time-varying industry
characteristics, create a spurious correlation between TRI plant openings and executive
migration.
Third, firm-specific characteristics might affect the self-selection of executives out of
particular geographical areas. To condition out all time-invariant firm traits, we control for
firm fixed effects. Below, we address additional concerns with these evaluations of the
relationship between TRI plant openings and executive departures.
Panel A of Table 4 shows that TRI plant openings are associated with an
economically large and statistically significant increase in the percentage of executives who
leave S&P 1500 firms close to the new TRI plants. Across all specifications, each of the three
measures of TRI Open enters positively and significantly. This holds when the dependent
!
variable is either the proportion of executives who leave the firm during year t (𝐸!,!
) or the
!
proportion of executives who leave during year t and t+1 (𝐸!,!
). Furthermore, the results are

robust to excluding or including the time-varying firm characteristics and the estimated
13

coefficients on the TRI Open variables change little when conditioning on firm traits. The
estimated coefficients are economically meaningful. For example, using regression (4), if one
TRI plant opens within one mile of an S&P 1500 firm, the proportion of executives who
leave during the next year rises by 4.23%, where 11.9% of executives leave the average firm
every year.
3.3.

Addressing Additional Identification Concerns

We next conduct six tests to address additional identification concerns. First, we
differentiate firms by their distances to TRI plant openings. If exposure to toxic pollutants
triggers executive migration, then the impact of the opening of toxic-emitting TRI plants on
executive migration should be larger for firms that are closer to the new TRI plants. To
evaluate this hypothesis, we use the same specification as in equation (2) except that the
explanatory variable is either (a) a dummy variable that equals one if a TRI plant opened
within one mile of the firm (TRI Open Within 1 Mile, (b) a dummy variable that equals one if
a TRI plant opened between 1 and 2 miles of the firm (TRI Open Between 1 and 2 Miles), and
(c) dummy variable that equals one if a TRI plant opened between 2 and 5 miles of the firm
(TRI Open Between 2 and 5 Miles). Since the density of pollution dissipates with distance
(see, e.g., Currie et al. 2015), we test whether the relationship between TRI plant openings
and executive migration falls as the distance between the TRI plant and the firm grows.
As shown in Panel B of Table 4, the results are consistent with the view that physical
exposure to pollution induces executives to leave. Besides repeating the finding that TRI
Open Within 1 Mile, the results show that the estimated relationship between TRI plant
openings and the rate of executive migration from S&P 1500 firms falls when the distance
between the plant and firm is larger. Indeed, when examining firms between two and five
miles from the TRI plant, we find (1) no significant increase in the rate of executive
departures following TRI plant openings, i.e., the coefficient on TRI Open Between 2 and 5
Miles enters insignificantly. Furthermore, the absolute value of the estimated coefficient on
TRI Open Between 1 and 2 Miles is much smaller than that on TRI Open Within 1 Mile. For
example, when considering executives that leave within one year of the TRI plant opening
14

while including firm controls, the estimated coefficient on TRI Open Between 1 and 2 Miles
is only about one-third of the coefficient estimate on TRI Open Within 1 mile.
Second, we distinguish between a firm’s leaders who are more likely to spend
considerable time at the firm’s headquarters from leaders who are typically not physically
present at corporate headquarters on a regular basis. If a firm’s leaders migrate when a TRI
plant opens close by because they are physically exposed to pollution, then we should not
observe an increase in the rate of migration among corporate leaders who are not physically
present at their firm’s headquarters on a regular basis. To conduct this placebo test, we
examine non-executive directors, who do not typically work at the firm’s headquarters on a
daily basis, and evaluate the impact of TRI plant openings on the rate of non-executive
director departures. We define the rate of non-executive director migration as the percentage
of non-executive directors who leave firm f during year t (or during years t and t+1), divided
by the total number of non-executive directors in that firm, f, at the end of year t-1).
As shown in Panel C of Table 4, the results of the placebo test are consistent with the
interpretation that physical exposure to pollution drives executive migration. For nonexecutive directors—those who are less likely to be physically present at their S&P 1500
firms on a regular basis, we find no relationship between TRI plant openings and migration.
However, as shown in Panel A, for executives, there is a strong, positive relationship between
the opening of a TRI plant and the rate of executive departures.
As a third test, we examine the impact of non-TRI plant openings on the rate of
executive migration from neighboring S&P 1500 firms. If the results are driven by
pollution—and not by some other factor associated with new plant formation, then the
opening of non-TRI plants should not influence the migration of corporate leaders from
geographically close S&P 1500 firms. To conduct this placebo test, we use the NETS data
and identify the location of all non-TRI plant openings during the same sample period and
conduct the same analyses as those reported in Table 4 Panel A.
As shown in Panel D of Table 4, the results are consistent with the view that it is the
opening of toxic emitting TRI plants—and not the opening of plants in general, the drive
executive migration. Consistent with the placebo hypothesis, there is no evidence that the
15

opening of non-TRI plants close to S&P 1500 firms induces executive migration from those
firms.
Fourth, we address the concern that executives might separate from firms
involuntarily because of poor firm performance, not because they are exposed to pollution. If
TRI plant openings are more likely to occur around failing S&P 1500 firms and failing firms
are more likely to fire executives, then the Panel A results in Table 4 could reflect the impact
of poor firm performance on both executive separations and TRI plant opening, not the
impact of pollution on executive migration.
To address this concern, we eliminate S&P 1500 firms that were performing poorly
during the year prior to TRI plants opening close to those firms. In particular, in Panel E of
Table 4, we conduct the same analyses as those in Panel A except that we exclude firms that
experienced over a 10% reduction in their stock prices in the year prior to TRI plant openings.
If TRI plant openings are more likely to occur around failing S&P 1500 firms and failing
firms are more likely to fire executives. In this way, we exclude firms that were performing
poorly—firms for which involuntary executive separations are more likely than in better
performing S&P 1500 firms. If the earlier results are driven by poor firm performance driving
both executive migration and TRI plant openings, then the results should dissipate after we
exclude poorly performing firms. In contrast, if the results are driven by exposure to pollution,
then eliminating the poorly performing firms should not materially affect the results.
As shown in Panel E of Table 4, we continue to find a strong impact of TRI plant
openings on executive migration after excluding poorly performing firms. In unreported
robustness tests, we find that these results hold when using other stock price reduction cutoffs
besides 10%. The results in Tables 3 and 4 are consistent with the view that TRI plant
openings increase pollution around geographically close S&P 1500 firms and executives
working in those firms have higher probabilities of leaving those exposed firms, regardless of
the firm’s stock price performance before the TRI plant opening.7

7

We were also concerned that the results might differ by the power or prestige of the firm. Thus, we conducted
the analyses while splitting the sample between S&P 500 and other firms. The results hold in both groups and
the estimated coefficients are of similar magnitudes. These results are available on request.

16

Fifth, we implement both propensity score matching (PSM) and nearest neighbormatching (NNM) algorithms to estimate the impact of toxic emissions on executive migration.
That is, we match each “treated” firm with otherwise similar controls firms and compare the
frequency of executive separations in the treated and control groups.
For the PSM, we first run a probit regression on the full sample of COMPUSTAT
firms. The dependent variable is a dummy that indicates whether a firm has a TRI plant open
within 1 mile (or 2 miles) in a year or not. We regressors include five time-varying firm
characteristics (Total Assets, Leverage, Operating Cash Flow / Total Assets Ratio, Sales
Growth, and Cash Flow Volatility). From this Probit, we obtain predicted values of the
dependent variable, or the probability of having a TRI open near each firm. We then match
each treated firm-year observation to five control firm-year observations based on the closest
propensity scores and restrict the treated and control firms to those without TRI plant opening
nearby in the past three years. As is standard in these PSM algorithms, we might match the
same control firm-year observation to more than one treated firm-year observation. In our
analyses, the number of control firms is roughly 3.5 times the number of treated firms. The
sample used in regressions includes treated and control firms.
For the NNM, we search the entire COMPUSTAT database for five control firms with
the smallest Euclidean distance of five time-varying firm characteristics (Total Assets,
Leverage, Operating Cash Flow / Total Assets Ratio, Sales Growth, and Cash Flow Volatility)
and restrict the treated and control firms to those without TRI plants open nearby in the past
three years. As with the PSM technique, the NNM strategy might match the same control
firm-year observation for different treated firm-year observations and the regression sample
includes both treated and control firms.
As shown in Table 4 Panels F and G, the earlier results hold when using either the
PSM or the NNM algorithms: TRI plant openings materially increase the rate at which
executives leave treated firms. When examining executive departures from firms one or two
years after treatment, and when examining TRI plants opening within one or two miles of the
firms, the results hold across all specifications for both the PSM and NNM techniques. By

17

comparing similar treatment and control firm using these matching techniques, these analyses
reduce concerns that an omitted variable was biasing the earlier findings.
Finally, we conduct a placebo test to address the potential influence of pre-trends.
That is, rather than examining the relationship between the opening of a toxic-emitting TRI
plant and the subsequent migration of executives at neighboring firms, we examine the
relationship between TRI plant opening and the rate of executive migration before the TRI
plant opened. If the opening of a TRI plant triggers an increase in the rate of executive
migration at nearby plants, then we should not observe an increase in the rate of executives
separating from neighboring firms one or two years before the plant starts releasing toxic air
pollutants. We examine the rate of executive migrations (1) during the year before TRI plant
openings and (2) during the two years before TRI plant openings
As shown in Panel H of Table 4, the results confirm this view: TRI plant opening are
unassociated with executive migration during the year before the TRI plant opening or during
the two years before TRI plant openings. Rather, as shown above, TRI plant openings are
associated with a sharp increase in the rate of executive separations at neighboring firms in
the year following TRI plant openings. These findings are consistent with the view the
unexpected increases in air pollution induce executives to separate from firms at a faster rate.
3.4.

TRI Openings and Executive Migration: Individual-year Analyses

To provide more information on the relationship between TRI plant openings and
executive departures from neighboring firms and to address additional identification concerns,
we turn our focus from the proportion of executives leaving firms and instead trace the
decisions of individual executives over time. In these individual-year analyses, we evaluate
the change in the probability that an executive leaves an S&P 1500 firm when a TRI plant
opens nearby. By studying individuals rather than the group of executives at firms, we control
for all time-invariant, and several time-varying, traits of each executive.
In these regressions, the dependent variable is either 𝐿!!,!,! , which equals one if
executive i leaves firm f in year t, and zero otherwise, or 𝐿!!,!,! , which equals one if executive i
leaves firm f during year t or t+1, and zero otherwise. As above, we separately examine the
18

exposure of firm f to TRI plants in year t using TRI Open within 1 Milef,t or TRI Open within
2 Milesf,t. Furthermore, the regressions control for the time-varying S&P 1500 firm
characteristics discussed above (𝑿!,! ), as well as two characteristics of each executive (𝑪!,!,! ),
Tenure and Age, that might independently influence the rate of separation between the
executive and firm. We provide the results with and without 𝑿!,! and 𝑪!,!,! .
Thus, we estimate the following linear probability models:
𝐿!!,!,! , = 𝛼 + 𝛾𝐷𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑦(𝑇𝑅𝐼 𝑃𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑂𝑝𝑒𝑛)!,! + 𝜃𝑿!,! + 𝜆𝑪!,!,! + 𝛿!,! + 𝛿!,! + 𝛿!,! +
𝜖!,!,! ,

(3)

where the dependent variable is 𝐿!!,!,! or 𝐿!!,!,! . All regressions include city-year (𝛿!,! ),
industry-year (𝛿!,! ), and individual-firm (𝛿!,! ) fixed effects, where we use the city and
industry (k) of the S&P 1500 firm (f) in which individual i is an executive.8 The regressions
are estimated using OLS, and standard errors are double clustered at both the city and year
levels.
Consistent with the firm-level analyses, the results from the individual-level analyses
reported in Table 5 indicate that executives are more likely to leave their firms when a TRI
plant opens close to them. Each of the three measures of TRI Open enters positively and
significantly. These results hold when examining either the indicator of whether the executive
leaves during the year that the TRI plant opens or the indicator of whether the executive
leaves in the two years following the TRI plant opening. With respect to the economic sizes
of the estimated coefficients, consider the impact of one TRI plant opening within one mile of
an executive’s firm. The results reported in regression (3) indicate that this is associated with
an almost 5% increase in the probability that the executive leaves the firm within the next
year, where 12.7% of executives leave every year in the average firm.

8

We can include individual by firm fixed effects (𝛿!,! ) because some individuals are executives in more than
one firm during the sample period.

19

3.5.

Differentiating by Generalist and Specialist Executives

We next assess whether executives with different human capital skills respond
differently to TRI plant openings. We hypothesize that when TRI plant openings increase
toxic air pollutants, executives at nearby firms who have skills that are in stronger demand at
other firms will be more likely to relocate than executives with more firm-specific skills. This
hypothesis predicts that when executives are “treated” with air pollution, the executives with
more general human capital will be more likely to leave the firm than executives with more
firm-specific human capital.
To evaluate this hypothesis, we examine the degree to which CEOs have general
human capital skills, i.e., skills that are valued highly at other firms. We use the Generalist
CEO Index constructed and analyzed by Custodio, Ferreira, and Matos (2013) that gauges the
extent to which a CEO’s skills are transferrable across firms and industries. The Generalist
CEO Index varies over time for each individual and reflects information on the numbers of
past positions, firms, and industries and whether the executive was a CEO in the past and the
complexity of the organizations in which the CEO was employed.9 We then test whether
there is a larger increase in the rate of departures of CEOs with more general human capital
skills when a TRI plant opens nearby.
The regression specification and estimation procedures are the same as in equation (3)
except that we add an interaction term between TRI Open and Generalist CEO Index.
Specifically, we estimate the following equation:
𝐿!!,!,! , =
𝛼 + 𝛽𝑇𝑅𝐼 𝑂𝑝𝑒𝑛!,! ∗ 𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑠𝑡 𝐶𝐸𝑂 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥!,! + 𝜙𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑠𝑡 𝐶𝐸𝑂 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥!,! +
𝛾𝑇𝑅𝐼 𝑂𝑝𝑒𝑛!,! + 𝜃𝑿!,! + 𝜆𝑪!,!,! + 𝛿!,! + 𝛿!,! + 𝛿!,! + 𝜖!,!,! ,

9

(4)

The Index can, in some cases, vary over time while an individual is a CEO at one firm, as individuals
occasionally take simultaneous positions at other firms. We conducted all of the analyses using the value of
Generalist CEO Index for individual i in firm f during the first year that the individual is a CEO at firm f,
eliminating any time variation in Generalist CEO Index for individual i at firm f. All of the results hold.

20

where the variables are defined as above. If 𝛽 > 0, then this would suggest that CEO
departures are more likely in response to a TRI plant opening when the CEO has more
general, and hence more transferable, skills.
As shown in Table 6, the evidence is consistent with the view that when firms are
exposed to air pollution from the opening of a TRI plant, executives with more general
human capital skills leave firms more frequently during the next years than executives with
more firm-specific skills. These results are reported in regressions (5) – (8) of Table 6. The
estimated coefficient on the interaction term between TRI Open and Generalist CEO Index
enters positively and significantly for each of the three TRI Open measures and these findings
are robust to including or excluding the time-varying firm and individual controls. The
estimated economic effects are large. For example, compare two CEOs running exactly the
same S&P 1500 firm, one at the 25th percentile of the distribution of the Generalist CEO
Index (-0.71) and the other at the 75th percentile of distribution (0.54). The results from
regression (8) indicate that the opening of a TRI plant within two miles of these CEOs would
increase the probability of the CEO at the 75th percentile of leaving the firm by 32% more
than the CEO at the 25th percentile of the Generalist CEO Index distribution, i.e., 32% =
0.257*(0.46 – (-0.79)). By differentiating executives by human capital and showing that they
respond in a theoretically predictable manner to the same pollution shock, we reduce
concerns that the findings on executive migration are driven by an omitted factor that
simultaneously increases pollution and executive migration in city.

4.

Extensions
We now extend the results by examining two additional implications of the view that

TRI plant openings increase toxic emissions that induce executives at neighboring firms to
leave. We explain each implication and then provide an empirical evaluation.
4.1.

CARs around Executives’ Turnover Announcement

First, if there are costs associated with replacing well-performing executives (e.g.,
Gabaix and Landier 2008) and air pollution triggers the departure of executives in general,
21

and not simply the departure of poorly-performing executives, then air pollution-induced
migration will tend to reduce the firm’s stock price. That is, if air pollution is causing an
otherwise sound executive to leave a firm, this is likely to have an adverse effect on the firm
as suggested by the work of Warner, Watts and Wruck (1988) and Denis and Denis (1995).
Since we showed (Table 4) that TRI plant openings trigger the departure of executives in
general, not the departure of executives from poorly performing firms in particular, we now
assess what happens to the stock prices of S&P 1500 firms when executives announce their
departures, both departures associated with TRI plant openings and departures that are
unassociated with such openings.
We examine the relationship between the announcement date of executive departures
and their firm’s cumulative abnormal returns (CARs). To obtain announcement dates,
ExecuComp provides some of those dates and we hand-collected most dates from Factiva
news and 8-K filings. In particular, using the announcement dates from ExecuComp, our
sample is 1,772. We confirm each of these announcements using separate sources (Factiva
and 8-K filings). We then searched Factiva and 8-K filings for information on each executive
at S&P 1500 firms over our sample period to discern the announcement date of other
executive departures. This increased our sample to 4,365, for which we can compute the
firms’ CARs around those dates. We report the results with our larger sample, and note that
the results hold with the smaller, ExecuComp-only sample.
To compute the CARs, we use security prices from the Center for Research in
Security Prices (CRSP) database. We examine CARs over the 5-day window from two days
before until two days after the announcement day. Setting the announcement day as day 0,
the CAR window is therefore indicated as (-2, +2). We use three standard models to compute
abnormal returns. The 1-factor abnormal return is computed as the firm’s return minus the
market index return. Following Brown and Warner (1985), we define 3-factor and 4-factor
abnormal returns by using the difference between actual and projected returns. To compute
projected returns, we (1) regress the firm’s daily return on the value-weighted returns on the
CRSP equally weighted market portfolio over the 200-day period from the 210th trading day
through the 11th trading day before the announcement date of each deal and (2) use the
22

estimated parameters to compute the projected returns during the 5-day event window (-2,
+2). For the 3-factor model, we use the Fama-French benchmark factors of Rm-Rf, SMB, and
HML as regressors, where Rm-Rf is the value-weighted market return minus the one-month
Treasury bill rate, SMB (Small Minus Big) is the average return on three small portfolios
minus the average return on three big portfolios, and HML (High Minus Low) is the average
return on two value portfolios minus the average return on two growth portfolios. The
numbers are obtained from Kenneth R. French’s website. The 4-factor model adds the FamaFrench momentum factor, which is constructed from six value-weighted portfolios formed
using independent sorts on size and prior returns of NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stocks.10
We report the results in Table 7 using the 4-factor model, but all of the results hold using
either the 1- or 3-factor models to construct 5-day CARs around the announcement date.
Table 7 provides regression results where the dependent variable is the 5-day CARs
around the announced departure dates of executives from S&P 1500 firms and the main
explanatory variable is a dummy variable that equals one if a TRI plant opened close to the
S&P 1500 firm. In particular, the main explanatory variable is either TRI Open within 1 Mile
or TRI Open within 2 Miles. All regressions include firm and year dummy variables. As
indicated, we also provide regressions conditioning on time-varying Firm Controls (Total
Assets, Leverage, Operating Cash Flow / Total Assets Ratio, Sales Growth, and Cash Flow
Volatility) and time-varying Individual controls (Tenure and Age). Thus, Table 7 provides
tests of whether there are significant differences between the CARs around announced
departures of executives from (1) firms exposed to TRI plant offerings and (2) firms
unexposed to such openings.
As shown, when executives announce their departures from S&P 1500 firms exposed
to TRI plant openings, the CARs of those firms fall significantly more than when executives
depart from unexposed firms.11 This is consistent with the views that (a) the toxic releases
10

The momentum factor equals 1/2 (Small High + Big High) - 1/2 (Small Low + Big Low),
http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/Data_Library/det_mom_factor_daily.html.
11
Besides finding that the CARs of firms with executive departures following TRI-plant openings fall more than
the CARs of firms with executive departures that were not exposed to TRI-plants, we also find that the CARs of
firms with executive departures following TRI-plant openings fall. These results are consistent with the
extensive literature on executive departures in general and are available on request.

23

from TRI plant openings induce some otherwise well-performing executive at neighboring
firms to separate from those firms, so that the distribution of executive departures following
TRI plant openings at neighboring firms has a higher proportion of these voluntary departures
than the executive departures from firms unexposed to TRI plant opening and (b) voluntary
executive departures have a larger adverse influence on stock prices than executive
departures for other reasons, including poor firm performance or expected poor performance.
These findings suggest that TRI plant openings have material effects on the executives and
shareholders of neighboring firms.
4.2. Comparison of Pollutant Density between New Areas and Old Areas
The view that pollution triggers executive migration provides predictions about where
those departing executives go and their compensation at their new firms. First, if executives
leave S&P 1500 firms because of pollution, then we should observe these executives moving
to firms in less polluted areas. To assess whether this holds, we first identify the location of
the executive’s new firm through BoardEx and ExecuComp. We then compute the pollutant
levels in the first year after the executive moves to the new firm using EPA monitor data.
Specifically, for each pollutant, we compute the pollutant’s level at the executive’s “old firm”
and its level at the new firm, where monitor nearest to the firm measures the pollutant level.
Since not all executives who leave S&P 1500 firms following TRI plant closings migrate to
other S&P 1500 firms, these analyses materially reduce the sample size. Thus, we simply
provide the results for executives leaving S&P 1500 firms after a TRI plant opens within two
miles of the firm.
As shown in Table 8, executives who leave S&P 1500 firms after a TRI plant opens
nearby tend to move to firms in less polluted parts of the country. These findings are not
surprising given that (a) TRI plants increase pollution and (b) executives have a higher
propensity to migrate following the opening of TRI plants close their firms. Nevertheless, it is
valuable to confirm that when executives leave a firm following the opening of a
geographically close toxic emitting plant, they tend to find new executive positions in firms
located in areas with lower pollution levels.
24

5.

Conclusion
In this paper, we examined the impact of toxic emissions on the migration of

corporate executives from neighboring firms. We merge data on TRI plant openings—plants
that emit toxic air pollutants—with information on the career paths of executives at all S&P
1500 firms. We then ask: When one firm starts emitting toxic pollutants, does this induce the
migration of corporate executives from neighboring firms and are such migrations associated
with a drop in the CARs of those firms?
We discover that the opening of toxic emitting plants increases the rate at which
executives leave geographically close firms. These findings are especially pronounced among
executives with more general human capital skills and are not driven by executives at firms
experiencing poor stock price performance. We also show that increases in executive
migration following the opening of geographically close toxic emitting plants hold for
executives who are most likely to work regularly and physically at the firm. Indeed, the
findings do not hold for non-executive directors, who are unlikely to be physically present at
the firm on a regulator basis and therefore less likely to be affected by the TRI plant-induced
increase in air pollution. In addition, we show stock returns fall when executives announce
their departures following the opening of toxic-emitting plants. These analyses suggest that
an additional, costly externality of air pollution is the migration of executives from
geographically close firms.

Table 1 Sample Construction and Variable Definition
This table (1) describes the construction of the three samples (Monitor-Plant-Year Sample, Firm-Year Sample, and
Person-Year Sample) and (2) provides variable definitions of the dependent, independent, and control variables.
The variables are ordered according to when they appear in the tables.
Sample Construction
Firm-Year Sample

Each row is an S&P 1500 firm’s observation in a year. Data are constructed
from EPA, BoardEx and Compustat.

Monitor-Plant-Year Sample

For each functioning monitor in a year, we match the TRI plant location with it
and construct monitor-plant pairs. Each row is a pollutant’s density (in
nanogram/m3) in a monitor-plant pair in a year. A dummy shows whether the
plant is operating or not within 10 miles of the monitor in a given year. Data are
from EPA.
Each row is an executive’s observation in an S&P 1500 company in a year.
Data are constructed from EPA, BoardEx and Compustat.

Person-Year Sample

Dependent Variables
1-factor (3-factor, 4-factor) CAR
(-2，+2)

5-day CAR during the window (-2, +2), where day 0 is the date that an
executive announces her leaving. We define abnormal returns by using the
difference between actual and projected returns, where we estimate projected
returns as follows: (1) based on 1-factor (3-factor, 4-factor) stock abnormal
return model, regress the S&P 1500 firm’s daily return on the returns on the
CRSP value-weighted market portfolio over the 200-day period from the 210th
trading day through the 11th trading day before the announcement date and
collect the estimated coefficients and (2) use the estimated coefficients to
compute the projected returns during the 5-day event window (-2, +2). Data are
from CRSP.

All Other Compensation

The value of an executive's all other compensation. In thousand USD. Obtained
from BoardEx and ExecuComp.

Dummy (Leave the Company in
One Year)

In the person-year level data, for each executive that was in the S&P 1500
company in year y-1, the dummy equals one if she was in the company in year
y+1, and equals zero if she was not in the company in year y+1. Constructed
from BoardEx and ExecuComp.

Dummy (Leave the Company in
Two Years)

In the person-year level data, for each executive that was in the S&P 1500
company in year y-1, the dummy equals one if she was in the company in year
y+2, and equals zero if she was not in the company in year y+2. Constructed
from BoardEx and ExecuComp.

Percentage of Executives Who
Left the Companies in One Year

In the firm-year level data, for each S&P 1500 firm, first construct the list of all
executives from BoardEx and ExecuComp in year y-1 (say n executives in
total), and the list of all executives in year y+1; then construct the list of
executives who were in the company in year y-1 but not in year y+1 (say there
are m executives who have left the company); then the percentage of executives
who left the company is defined as m/n. Constructed from BoardEx and
ExecuComp.

31

Percentage of Executives Who
Left the Companies in Two
Years

Percentage of Non-executive
Directors Who Left the
Companies in One Year

In the firm-year level data, for each S&P 1500 firm, first construct the list of all
executives from BoardEx and ExecuComp in year y-1 (say n executives in
total), and the list of all executives in year y+2; then construct the list of
executives who were in the company in year y-1 but not in year y+2 (say there
are m executives who have left the company); then the percentage of executives
who left the company is defined as m/n. Constructed from BoardEx and
ExecuComp.
In the firm-year level data, for each S&P 1500 firm, first construct the list of all
non-executive directors from BoardEx and ExecuComp in year y-1 (say n nonexecutive directors in total), and the list of all non-executive directors in year
y+1; then construct the list of non-executive directors who were in the company
in year y-1 but not in year y+1 (say there are m non-executive directors who
have left the company); then the percentage of non-executive directors who left
the company is defined as m/n. Constructed from BoardEx and ExecuComp.

Percentage of Non-executive
Directors Who Left the
Companies in Two Years

In the firm-year level data, for each S&P 1500 firm, first construct the list of all
non-executive directors from BoardEx and ExecuComp in year y-1 (say n nonexecutive directors in total), and the list of all non-executive directors in year
y+2; then construct the list of non-executive directors who were in the company
in year y-1 but not in year y+2 (say there are m non-executive directors who
have left the company); then the percentage of non-executive directors who left
the company is defined as m/n. Constructed from BoardEx and ExecuComp.

Table 3: TRI Plant Openings and Major Pollutants
This table reports the effect of TRI plant openings on air pollution. To measure air pollution, we use the annual density of major air pollutants recorded by
EPA monitors within one (Panel A) or two (Panel B) miles of each TRI plant. The table reports the estimated coefficient on 𝐷𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑦 𝑃𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑖𝑠 𝑂𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 !,! ,
which is a dummy variable that equals zero in the years before a TRI plant opens and one afterwards. The last column of Table 3 provides information on the
economic magnitudes of the estimated coefficient on Dummy (Plant is Operating) for each pollutant by computing the estimated change in the pollutant as a
percentage of the pollutant’s average across all monitors in the country. All regressions control for year fixed effects and monitor-plant fixed effects. Robust
t-statistics are in parentheses. *, **, *** indicate significance at 1%, 5% and 10%.

Table 4: Executives Departures and TRI Plant Openings
Panel A: Core results on TRI plant openings and executive departures
This table presents OLS regression results of the relation between the percentages of executives who leave their S&P 1500 firms in the one or two years
following the opening of a nearby TRI plant. The dependent variables are the percentages of executives who leave their S&P 1500 firms in the indicated time
period. The main independent variables include the dummy variables of TRI plant opening within 1 or 2 miles of the S&P 1500 firm respectively. All
regressions include time-varying Firm Controls (Total Assets, Leverage, Operating Cash Flow / Total Assets Ratio, Sales Growth, and Cash Flow Volatility),
as well as city-year, industry-year and firm fixed effects. Table 1 provides variable definitions. Standard errors are double clustered at the city and year level.

This table presents OLS regression results of the relation between the percentages of executives who leave their S&P 1500 firms in the one or two years
following the opening of a nearby TRI plant. The dependent variables are the percentages of executives who leave their S&P 1500 firms in the indicated time
period. The main independent variables are respectively (a) a dummy variable that equals one if a TRI plant opened within one mile of the firm, (b) a dummy
variable that equals one if a TRI plant opened between 1 and 2 miles of the firm, and (c) dummy variable that equals one if a TRI plant opened between 2 and
5 miles of the firm. All regressions include time-varying Firm Controls (Total Assets, Leverage, Operating Cash Flow / Total Assets Ratio, Sales Growth, and
Cash Flow Volatility), as well as city-year, industry-year and firm fixed effects. Table 1 provides variable definitions. Standard errors are double clustered at
the city and year level. Robust t-statistics are in parentheses. *, **, *** indicate significance at 1%, 5% and 10%.

Table 6: Individual Probability of Leaving and TRI Plant Openings: Interaction with Generalist CEO Index
This table presents OLS regression results of the relation between each CEO’s decision to leave or remain in their S&P 1500 firm, while differentiating CEOs
by the degree of general human capital. The dependent variables are dummies that equal one for the CEO leaving the company in one/two year(s) and zero
otherwise. The main independent variables are (a) the dummy variables of TRI plant opening within 1 or 2 miles of the S&P 1500 firm respectively and (b)
the interaction of these TRI plant opening variables with the Generalist CEO Index. The Generalist CEO Index measures the skills of the CEO that are
transferrable across firms and industries. All regressions include time-varying Firm Controls (Total Assets, Leverage, Operating Cash Flow / Total Assets
Ratio, Sales Growth, and Cash Flow Volatility), time-varying Individual controls (Tenure and Age), as well as city-year, industry-year and individual-firm
fixed effects. Table 1 provides variable definitions. Standard errors are double clustered at the city and year level. Robust t-statistics are in parentheses. *, **,

Table 7: CAR around Executives’ Turnover Announcement
The dependent variable is the 4-factor CARs around the announcement dates of executive departures from
S&P 1500 firms. The dependent variable is the 5-day CARs around the announced departure dates of
executives from S&P 1500 firms and the main explanatory variable is a dummy variable that equals one if
a TRI plant opened close to the S&P 1500 firm. The explanatory variable of focus is either a dummy
variable that equals one if a TRI plant opened within one mile of the S&P 1500 firm (TRI Open within 1
Mile) or a dummy variable that equals one if a TRI plant opened within two miles of the S&P 1500 firm
(TRI Open within 1 Mile). All regressions include firm and year fixed effects. As indicated, regressions (3)
and (4) also condition on time-varying Firm Controls (Total Assets, Leverage, Operating Cash Flow /
Total Assets Ratio, Sales Growth, and Cash Flow Volatility) and time-varying Individual controls (Tenure
and Age). Robust t-statistics clustered at firm level are in parentheses. *, **, *** indicate significance at
