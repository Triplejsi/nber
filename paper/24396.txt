ABSTRACT
We investigate the extent to which the quality of judicial institutions has an impact on
individuals’ propensity for criminal and dishonest behavior and on their views regarding the
acceptability of dishonesty and law-breaking. We use micro data on residents of 25 European
countries and employ alternative measures of judicial quality. Acknowledging that the quality of
judicial institutions is endogenous, we employ as an instrument the procedures with which
prosecutors and judges are appointed to their posts in each country. The results reveal that an
increase in the quality of judicial institutions, such as an improvement in judicial independence or
the impartiality of the courts, has a deterrent effect on dishonest and criminal acts. A higher
quality judicial system makes individuals less likely to find acceptable a variety dishonest and
illicit behaviors, suggesting that institutions help shape the beliefs of the society.

Quality of Judicial Institutions, Crimes, Misdemeanors, and Dishonesty
I. Introduction
There are substantial differences between countries in the extent to which people
consider illegal or dishonest behavior acceptable. For example, to the question of “How
wrong is it to buy something you thought might be stolen?” only 3.8 percent of people in
Denmark respond to indicate that it is “Not wrong at all” or “A bit wrong.” The approval
rate of the act of buying a stolen good is 12.4 percent in the Netherlands, 18.1 percent in
Bulgaria, 22.4 percent in France, and 30.4 percent in Russia. While 13.2 percent of
Ukrainians find that bribery is “not wrong at all”, or “a bit wrong,” only less than one
percent of people in Iceland think that bribery is acceptable behavior. The approval rate of
bribery is 3.2 percent in Germany, 5.7 percent in Belgium, and 6.8 percent in Spain.1
As there are significant differences between countries in the rate at which people
tolerate dishonesty, there is a similarly sizable between-country variation in crime rates,
corruption and other illegal activity. In 2011 there were 1,750 reported thefts per 100,000
inhabitants in Italy, but the rate was 931 in Portugal, and 605 in Poland.2 The murder rate
in that year was 0.88 in Denmark, 1.08 in Portugal, and 2.29 in Turkey in that same year.
While some of these differences in crime rates can be explained by variations in

The crime statistics are obtained from Eurostat. Statistics are reported d for 2011 because that is
the last year which is covered in our analysis sample.

deterrence, labor market conditions and income levels between countries, a significant
amount of variation in illegal activity remains unexplained.3
Motivated by these observations, and to provide new insights into the question of
“Why does illegal activity and its acceptability vary so much by country?” in this paper
we investigate the extent to which differences in the quality of judicial institutions between
countries help explain the differences in criminal and dishonest behavior, as well as the
acceptability of such behavior. Specifically, we analyze whether the quality of a country’s
legal institutions has an impact on individuals’ propensity to engage in illicit activity in
that country, ranging from falsifying official documents to buying stolen goods to
concealing the defects of a second-hand product when selling it. We also analyze whether
the quality of the judicial system has an impact on people’s beliefs regarding the
acceptability of dishonesty and law-breaking, ranging from tax evasion to bribery, from
exaggerating an insurance claim to acting dishonestly to make money.
We use micro data on the residents of 25 European countries who are surveyed
between 2004 and 2011 to investigate whether indicators of judicial quality, such as the
independence of the country’s judiciary, the impartiality of the courts, or the protection of
property rights have an impact on citizens’ proclivity to break the law or to engage in
dishonest activity, and on the extent to which people believe that dishonest behavior is
acceptable.

Some of these differences in crime rates may be attributed to dissimilarities in the classification of
crimes and in the reporting rates between counties (Soares 2004). Because murder is a crime
which is reported accurately in most countries, cross-country comparisons based on murder should
be more reliable.

The paper makes contributions to two areas of investigation. First, it contributes to
the economics of crime literature by adding the quality of the judicial system to the
economic analysis of criminal decision-making. Research in economics has produced
significant amount of credible information regarding the causal impact of key determinants
of criminal activity (Drago et al. 2009, Mocan and Bali 2010, Corman and Mocan 2005,
Machin and Meghir 2004, Di Tella and Schargrodsky 2004, Raphael and Winter-Ebmer
2001, Corman and Mocan 2000). The variation in crime rates between countries, however,
cannot be fully explained by making use of the causal estimates of the determinants of
crime obtained from existing studies. Thus, judicial quality might help add to our
understanding of the variation in illicit activity between countries.
Judicial system’s lack of independence and the absence of impartiality of the courts
may provide signals to the citizens about the ambiguity and unfairness of judicial
decisions. Houser, Vetter and Winter (2012) find in a laboratory experiment that people,
who believe that they were treated unfairly during an interaction with another person, are
more likely to cheat in an unrelated subsequent game.4 This suggests that if poor judicial
quality and biased court decisions alter people’s perceptions of the fairness of the judicial
system, this could impact their propensity of rule violation and law breaking.
Relatedly, a decay in the quality of institutions is expected to reduce the perceived
certainty of punishment if deterioration in judicial quality leads to inefficiency and
uncertainty in the criminal justice system. This may, in turn, lead to increased propensity to
disregard the rule of law.5 Evidence on this point is presented by Dusek (2015) who finds

4

Those who cheat in the lab are also likely to cheat outside of the lab (Potters and Stoop 2016).
This is also similar to the relationship between uncertainty in legal labor market returns and its
impact on criminal propensity (Mocan et al. 2005).

that quick resolution of criminal cases leads to a decline in burglary and embezzlement.
Consistent with the arguments listed above, we find evidence that low judicial quality
makes people more likely to engage in illegal and dishonest acts.
The second contribution of the paper is its demonstration that the quality of judicial
institutions has an impact on beliefs and attitudes. Gaehter and Schulz (2016) find that the
proportion of young people who cheat in a lab experiment is positively correlated with the
prevalence of rule violation in the country, which leads the authors to argue that
institutions and culture influence the prevalence of rule violation in the society, which in
turn impacts peoples’ intrinsic honesty. Of course it can also be argued that intrinsic
honesty, as a cultural trait, has an impact on the prevalence of rule violation. More
precisely, a cultural belief or attitude such as tolerance for dishonesty, will impact the
propensity for rule violation and unlawful behavior. At the same time, the extent of the
rule violation in the society will have an impact on the tolerance for and the acceptability
of rule violation.
If most people in a society approve a certain behavior as appropriate and
acceptable, that particular behavior can be thought of as part of the culture of the society.
Cultural beliefs and values of a society, even those that are based on superstition, can be
persistent across many generations (Mocan and Yu 2017). Yet, beliefs are also malleable
and they react to the economic social environment.6 Giavazzi et al. (2014) formulate the
evolution of values and beliefs as being driven by vertical and horizontal transmissions.
Vertical transmission pertains to shaping the beliefs and values of children within the

Even feelings that can be thought of as having been deeply engrained in the fabric of culture, or in
human psyche, respond to economic and social environment. For example, people’s racist,
xenophobic and anti-Semitic attitudes (Mocan and Rashke 2016) and even vengeful feelings
(Mocan 2013) are influenced by economic and social circumstances.

family so as to make it easier for the offspring to function better in the society. But,
individuals are also exposed to the environment outside of the family, and the sanctions
and incentives of the institutional and social environment shape beliefs and values as well,
constituting the horizontal transmission of values. The authors write that “Vertical
transmission, like genetic inheritance, tends to be relatively more conservative, giving rise
to slow evolution of culture; horizontal transmission, as in an epidemic, may result in a
rapid change in the number of people who adopt a new cultural characteristic particularly if
it is attractive to the receiver.” (Giavazzi et al. 2014, p.2). Investigating whether
immigrants’ beliefs and values remain unchanged across generations or whether they
change quickly to conform to the prevailing norm in the destination country, the authors
find that while some cultural beliefs and values (inherited from the country of origin) are
highly stable across generations, others converge quickly to the prevailing norms.
Di Tella, Galiani and Schargrodsky (2007) find that following the passage of an
expropriation law which intended to grant private land to squatters, some squatter families
obtained property rights to the land they occupied, while others could not do so because
the original owners contested the law in court. The authors show that this differential
experience of being able to obtain the title of the land vs. being unable to do so altered the
beliefs of the squatters about the merits of the free market, and in favor of materialistic and
individualistic beliefs. That is, those who ended up with weak property rights and those
who obtained full property rights developed very different beliefs about free markets.
Along the same lines, people’s beliefs are influenced by the political regime in which they
live. Alesina and Fuchs-Schuendeln (2007) show that the difference in preferences

5

between former East and West Germans is mostly because of the direct influence of
communism.
Following this research, we investigate the extent to which people’s beliefs about
the appropriateness of dishonesty are impacted by the quality of the judicial institutions to
which they are exposed. For example, we investigate the extent to which people agree or
disagree with such statements as ”If you want to make money, you can’t always act
honestly,” “Citizens should not cheat on their taxes,” It is wrong to sell someone
something second-hand and conceal some or all of its faults,” “It is wrong to make an
exaggerated or false insurance claim.” The full list of the variables used in the analyses
and their definitions are provided in Table 1.
As described in the empirical framework section in detail, we employ four different
measures of institutional quality, and we consider these quality measures as endogenous.
The endogeneity of institutional quality may arise for a number of reasons. For example,
institutional quality can emerge as an equilibrium outcome, and it can be influenced by
general attitudes towards dishonesty prevailing in the society. Alternatively, reverse
causality from dishonest behavior to institutional quality cannot be ruled out. This can
happen if more dishonest behavior and the ensuing overload of the criminal justice system
impact the quality of the judicial decisions. Thus, we estimate the models by instrumental
variables, utilizing the process through which judges and district attorneys are appointed to
their posts as an instrument. There is variation across countries in this process. Judges and
prosecutors can be appointed by the government with no prerequisites or no requirements
other than a law degree and some work experience, or they can be appointed based on an
exam in addition to the required work experience. In the former case, the government has

6

full control on who gets appointed as a judge or as a prosecutor, while in the latter case the
government has much less influence. The manner in which the actors in the judicial
system are appointed is expected to be related to the impartiality of the judiciary. If the
government has the authority to appoint judges and prosecutors at will, those judges and
prosecutors are more likely to be biased towards the government in comparison to the
judges and prosecutors who are appointed to their positions following a written exam. On
the other hand, the method of appointment is not expected to have a direct impact on
people’s propensity for dishonest behavior.
We show that there is a strong first-stage relationship: this procedural variation
across countries, which is determined by law, or in some cases by the constitution of the
country, is strongly related to the judicial independence, to the impartiality of the courts, to
the protection of the property rights and well as to an index that combines these three
measures.
We find that the quality of the judicial system has a significant impact on people’s
propensity to break the law in a number of domains such as making an exaggerated or false
insurance claim, offering a bribe to a public official, falsely claiming government benefits,
buying something knowing that might have been a stolen good, selling something secondhand by concealing its faults. We also find that low quality of the judicial system makes it
more likely for people to consider a variety dishonest behavior as acceptable, suggesting
that institutions help shape the beliefs of the society.
Section II presents the empirical framework. Section III describes the data set and
the variables. Section IV presents the results, and Section V is the conclusion.

II. Empirical Framework
Consider Equation (1) below.
(1) Dict = β0 + β1 Jct + XiΦ + Cc Ω + δt + εict
where Dict is an indicator of dishonest behavior of person i who is a resident of country
c, surveyed at time t. Alternatively, Dict stands for indicators that represent individuals’
dishonest attitudes, measured by their approval of dishonest behavior. The types of
dishonest behavior we analyze in the paper could be classified as felony (major) crimes, or
they could be misdemeanors (minor crimes), depending on the country in which the
individual resides. For example, one of dishonesty indicators we employ is the response to
the question “In the last five years have you sold something second-hand and concealed
some or all of its faults?” This particular act could be punishable by law in some
countries, but it may not be punishable in some others. Furthermore, depending on the
priorities and resources of the judicial system, the police and prosecutors may decide not to
press charges for this offense even if it is a criminal act in that country. Another indicator
of dishonest behavior is whether the individual falsely claimed government benefits, such
as social security payments. This act is a crime in most countries, although the severity of
punishment may differ across countries. In summary, the first group of dependent
variables include six dishonest and criminal behaviors which differ in their severity of
criminality, ranging from offering a bribe to buying a stolen good.
The dependent variables in the second group gauge people’s attitudes towards
dishonesty. These variables measure individuals’ feelings about the acceptability of some
dishonest and illicit behaviors. For example, survey respondents are asked to evaluate

8

“how wrong it is” to sell a second-hand good and conceal its defects or to make a false
insurance claim. They are also asked whether they agree or disagree with such statements
as “a public official asking for bribe is wrong,” “It is wrong for citizens to cheat on their
taxes,” and “if you want to make money you cannot always act honestly.” The 12
variables that make up the set of dependent variables (D) in Equation (1) and their
definitions are discussed in Section III.
Equation (1) includes personal attributes of the respondents such as age, sex, years
of education, ethnic minority status, marital status, labor market activity, household
income, location of residence, religiosity, and home ownership. These control variables,
represented by vector X in Equation (1), are included to account for differences between
individuals regarding their propensity to commit crime, stemming from the relative returns
to crime and legal work (e.g. education, labor market activity, income). Other control
variables, such as sex and religiosity, intend to capture the impact of personal attributes
such as preferences and risk aversion.
The model cannot include country fixed effects because the indicators of judicial
quality exhibits negligible within-country variation over the short time period analyzed.
To account for country differences that may impact criminal proclivity and the tolerance
for dishonesty, the model includes country attributes, represented by C. These variables
also help absorb some of the deep impacts on our key explanatory variable, judicial
quality, that may be driven by country attributes. For example, judicial quality may be
systematically different between countries based on legal origins, the extent of their ethnolinguistic fragmentation, or the level of education. Thus, vector C includes such variables
as per capita GDP, average country education, the size of the population, ethno-linguistics

9

fragmentation and individualism indexes of the country, legal origin of the country, and the
proportion of government spending in national income.
The variable of interest, Jct, which represents the quality of the judicial institutions
in the country, is measured in different ways. This first measure, Judicial Independence,
ranges from 0 to 10. It captures the extent to which the judiciary is independent from the
influence of politics, the government, citizen or the firms. The second variable, Impartial
Courts, also ranges from 0 to 10. It measures whether the legal framework of the country
is not subject to manipulation and it is based on a clear and neutral process. Following
previous work (Acemoglu et al. 2001, Knack and Keefer 1995), we employ Protection of
Property Rights as the third measure of institutional quality. This variable provides a score
that rages from zero to 10 for each country to indicate the extent to which citizens’
property rights and assets are protected by law. Finally, we use principal component
analysis to create an index of institutional quality based on the three quality measures
described above.7 t represents fixed effects for survey years, and ict is a white noise error
term. Because cultural beliefs, preferences as well as attitudes towards crime and
dishonesty may be correlated within regions in a country, we cluster the standard errors by
country regions. Because we employ a number of different outcomes that aim to gauge

7

Trial delays and the inefficiency of the courts in resolving cases can impact criminal propensity
because such inefficiency may alter marginal criminal’s perception of risk and deterrence (Dusek
2015, Pellegrina 2008). Such court delays, as an indicator of low judicial ineffectiveness,
constitute one dimension of low judicial quality. However, in this paper we focus on low judicial
quality as an institution, measured by such aspects as the lack of judicial independence, and lack of
impartiality of the courts.

10

dishonest behavior and dishonest attitudes, we adjust the standard errors for multiple
hypothesis testing (Newson 2010, Benjamini and Yekutieli 2001)
Our main interest is the coefficient 1 in Equation (1). As described in Section 1,
Estimation of Equation (1), however, is complicated because institutional quality, J, may
be endogenous. For example, reverse causality from dishonest behavior to institutional
quality cannot be ruled out. This can happen if more dishonest behavior and the ensuing
overload of the criminal justice system impact the quality of the judicial decisions. To
account for this potential effect, we control for the effectiveness of the courts in keeping up
with the incoming caseload, measured by clearance rate for criminal cases in the country.
Institutional quality arguably evolves slowly, but it may be a function of the
prevailing attitudes towards dishonesty. A tolerant cultural attitude in the country towards
dishonesty would generate a higher propensity for dishonest acts, and it can also lead to
poor institutional quality. Put differently, a “culture of dishonesty” can have an impact on
both institutional quality and individual criminal propensity. To get around this potential
confounding, we estimate Equation (1) with instrumental variables as shown in Equation
(2) below.

(2) Jct = α0 + α1 Lc + XiΨ + Cc Γ + μt + ξict
where the quality of the judicial institutions, J, is instrumented with the appointment
procedures of judges and prosecutors in the country, represented by L. Although most
countries require some prior experience as a legal professional before being appointed as a
judge or prosecutor, in some countries judges and prosecutors are appointed by the
government without taking a competitive exam. In other countries, judges or prosecutors

11

qualify for their posts based on a formal written exam. This means that in some countries
the government has complete control over who gets appointed and who does not without
relying on exam scores, but in other countries the appointments to these positions are
arguably more objective and merit-based. As explained in the data section, we classify
countries into three groups based on procedural differences in how judges and prosecutors
are appointed. The country-specific guidelines and procedures of these appointments are
based on law, and in some countries they are written in the constitution. Assuming that the
procedures used to appoint judges and prosecutors have no direct influence on people’s
criminal proclivity or on their beliefs, appointment procedure of judges/prosecutors is a
valid instrument.

III. Data and Descriptive Statistics
The data are obtained from a variety of sources. The main data source is Economic
Morality Module and the Justice Module of the European Social Survey in Rounds 2 and
5, conducted between 2004-2006, and 2010-2011. There are 25 countries surveyed.8
Depending on the outcome variable, sample sizes range from 25,314 to 54,034. Table 1
displays the definitions and the descriptive statistics of the dependent variables. The
variables in Panel A are dichotomous indicators that take the value of 1 if the survey
respondent indicated that he/she has engaged in the behavior listed during the last five
years (1-Misusing or altering a document, 2-Falsely claiming government benefits, 3Offering a bribe, 4-Conceiling the faults of a second-hand product when selling, 5-Buying

8

The countries in the data set are: Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,
Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway,
Poland, Portugal, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey.

12

stolen goods, 6-Filing false or exaggerated insurance claims). Only 2.7 percent of the
individuals indicated that they misused or altered a card or a document to pretend to be
eligible for something they were not eligible. Similarly, only 1.6 percent indicated that
they falsely claimed government benefits such as social security, when they were not
entitled to. The highest rate pertains to buying something that might have been a stolen
good. Six-and-a half percent of the respondents indicated that they engaged in this
behavior. These relatively low rates, however, disguise a rather significant betweencountry variation. Panel A of Table 2 displays country averages for dishonest behaviors in
selected countries. While the proportion of respondents who indicated that they misused or
altered a document is 0.7 percent in Hungary, the rates are 2.3 percent in Switzerland, 4.3
percent in Spain and 5.8 percent in Czech Republic and Austria. Similar variation exists
between countries regarding the intensity of other dishonest behavior. For example, the
proportion of individuals who offered a bribe is only 0.2 percent in Iceland, while it is 2.8
percent in Estonia, 5.3 percent in Poland, and 8.5 percent in Slovakia.
The bottom part of Panel A in Table 2 presents the country averages of the
remaining three dishonest behavior in selected countries, and shows significant variation
between countries. For example, while only 1.1 percent of Hungarians conceal the defects
of the second-hand goods they sell, the rate is 4.6 percent in the Netherlands, and 5.3
percent in Finland. Only 1.5 percent of people in Lithuania indicate that they made a false
insurance claim, but the rate is 2.7 percent in Italy, and 7.2 percent in Austria.
It is clear that some of these differences could be the result of country attributes,
such as the level of economic development. For example, individuals who live in
developed countries with mature financial and insurance markets have more opportunities

13

to interact with insurers, which increases the possibility to file an insurance claim.
Similarly, for those who live in countries where the government is more engaged in the
economy, the frequency of interaction with a government agency and the opportunity to
claim a government benefit (accurately or falsely) is higher. To account for such country
differences, we control for a number of country attributes, as displayed in Table 3 below.
To assess whether the responses reported by the individuals in our data are similar
to other available information, we compared country-specific bribery rates that can be
calculated using the individuals in our data to outside sources. There is a high degree of
consistency between the extent of bribery revealed by the respondents in our data (their
own bribery activity) and corruption perception indexes of other sources, such as
Transparency International (TI). For example, as shown in the top panel of Table 2, only
0.2 percent of Icelandic and Finnish people report having paid a bribe during the last five
years. The Corruption Perception index values assigned to these countries by
Transparency International (from 1 to 10; 10 signifying lowest corruption) are 8.5 and 9.2,
respectively. Based on our data, the rate of bribery in Norway is 0.7 percent, and 5.3
percent of the Polish people paid a bribe during the last five years. The Transparency
International corruption perception index for these countries is 8.6 for the former, and 5.3
for the latter. As Table 2 shows, the bribery rates are 9.3 percent in the Czech Republic
and 8.5 percent in Slovakia. Their TI index values are 4.6 and 4.3, respectively. More
generally, the correlation between the country-specific bribery-giving rates obtained from
our data and the corruption perception index of the TI is -0.65, indicating reasonably
strong correlation.

14

The lower panel of Table 1 presents the definitions and the descriptive statistics of
the variables that measure the attitudes toward dishonesty. For example, the variable
“Cannot always act honestly if you want to make money” takes the value of one if the
individual strongly agrees, agrees, or remains neutral when presented with the statement
that “If you want to make money, you can’t always act honestly.” Although Table 1 shows
that about 51 percent of the respondents agree with this statement, Panel B of Table 2
shows that there is significant variation between countries. For example, while about 32
percent of Portuguese believe that one cannot always act honestly if one wants to make
money, 49 percent of the French and almost 70 percent of Italians think that this statement
is true.
The dichotomous variable “Cheating on taxes is not wrong” takes the value of one
if the respondent does not disagree or does not strongly disagree with the statement that
“Citizens should not cheat on their taxes,” and zero otherwise. More than 17 percent of the
sample thinks that cheating on taxes is acceptable. Table 2 shows that 6 percent of Turks
believe tax evasion is okay, while the rate is 12 percent in Poland, 18 percent in Denmark
and 25 percent in Germany.
Table 1 displays that 3.5 percent of the sample believe that bribery is not wrong.
This variable takes the value of one if the respondents indicated that “a public official
asking someone for a favor or bribe in return for their services” is not wrong at all, or a bit
wrong. Other variables, that gauge the extent to which people find various other dishonest
behavior acceptable, are measured similarly. These variables indicate whether the
individual believes that “Concealing the faults of a second-hand product is not wrong,”
“Buying a possibly stolen good is not wrong,” and “Making a false insurance claim” is not

15

wrong. Table 2 shows that countries differ substantially in the propensity of their citizens’
agreement with these responses. For example, while less than 4 percent of the respondents
in Norway think that making a false or exaggerated insurance claim is acceptable behavior,
the rate is about 13 percent in Italy, 23 percent in France and 40 percent in Russia.
The top panel of Table 3 displays the descriptive statistics of personal attributes of
the respondents and the middle panel presents the descriptive statistics of country
characteristics. The bottom section of Table 3 shows the definitions and the descriptive
statistics of the indicators of judicial quality. The sample mean of Judicial Independence is
about 7, but there is significant variation between countries. For example, the value of
Judicial Independence is 2.7 in Russia, 3.2 in Bulgaria, 4.7 in Italy, 5.5 in Turkey, 6.3 in
Portugal, 7.9 in Luxembourg and 9.0 in Denmark. The same variation exist in other
measures of judicial quality. For example, the value of Impartial Courts is 2.8 in Croatia,
2.9 in Russia, 3.3 in Italy, 4.4 in Hungary, 6.6 in France, 7.5 in Germany, 8.0 in Sweden,
and 8.6 in Austria.
The bottom section of Table 3 also displays information about the instrument:
Judge and Prosecutor Appointment, which is an index that classifies countries into three
groups. The value of the index is 0 if the appointment procedure does not use a
combination of exam and experience to appoint either judges or prosecutors. This group
of countries include Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Rep., Denmark, Finland,
France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and
Ukraine.
The index takes the value of 1 if the appointment procedure uses a competitive
exam to appoint either judges or prosecutors, and the index is equal to 2 if the

16

appointment procedure uses a competitive exam to appoint both judges and prosecutors.
Countries with index value of 1 are Estonia, Hungary, Norway, Russia, Slovak Republic
and Sweden. Countries with index value of 2 include Germany, Lithuania, the Netherlands,
Poland, Slovenia, and Turkey. In this last group of countries both judges and prosecutors
have to take an exam to qualify for their posts. The source of this information is the
European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ) 2014 Reports.

IV. Results
Table 4 presents instrumental variable results for all 12 regressions. Panel A
contains the results of six regressions where the dependent variables represent various
dishonest and criminal behavior. In the regressions reported in this table the quality of
judicial institutions is measured by Judicial Independence. In the interest of space, we
only report the coefficients of the judicial quality measures.9 The table contains two sets of
p-values. Those that are in (parentheses) are based on clustering at the region (NUTS1 or
NUTS2) level. Because we use as outcomes multiple variables that gauge similar aspects
of dishonest behavior and attitudes, we adjusted the p-values for multiple hypothesis
testing (Newson 2010). The adjusted p-values are reported in [brackets].
The results in Panel A of Table 4 reveal that an improvement in judicial
independence has no impact on the propensity to conceal the faults of a second-hand
product when selling it. On the other hand, an improvement in judicial independence
reduces the proclivity to misuse or alter a document. It also reduces the propensity to
falsely claim a government benefit, to offer a bribe, to buy stolen goods and to make an

exaggerated or false insurance claim. The results imply that if judicial independence of the
courts improved by one unit (e.g. an improvement from the level of Lithuania to Poland
{an increase of the index from 4 to 5}, or from the level of Turkey to about the level of
France {from 5.5 to 6.7}) this would lower the propensity to engage in these acts by 2-to-3
three percentage points.
Panel B of Table 4 displays the instrumental variables results related to dishonest
attitudes. The dependent variables in this group measure people’s beliefs in the approval
of dishonest behavior. For example, the outcome in cell (1) is an indicator that identifies if
the respondent indicated that “if you want to make money, you can’t always act honestly.”
Other outcomes in this group include the approval of such acts as cheating on taxes,
bribing a government official, concealing the faults of a product when selling, buying a
stolen good, and making a false insurance claim. Panel B shows that an increase in
institutional quality, measured by judicial independence, mitigates these attitudes. In other
words, an improvement in judicial independence makes individuals less likely to declare
that dishonest acts are acceptable. For example, an improvement in the judicial quality
from the level of Hungary to the level of France lowers the propensity to believe that “you
cannot always act honestly if you want to make money” by 10 percentage points, or by 20
percent from the baseline. The same improvement in judicial quality lowers the propensity
to declare that “cheating on taxes is not wrong” by 32 percent.
Table 5 presents the results of the same regressions with one difference: judicial
quality is measured by the variable Impartial Courts. The inference is not altered. An
increase in the quality of judicial institutions, measured by the extent to which courts are
impartial and not subject to manipulation, lowers both propensity to engage in criminal

18

acts (the top panel of Table 5), and it also lowers the propensity to find dishonesty
acceptable (the bottom panel of Table 5).
We repeat the same analysis, but use the protection of property rights as the
measure of institutional quality. The results, reported in Appendix Table A1, are similar to
those reported in Tables 4 and 5. Using the three measures of institutional quality
employed in the regressions so far (Judicial independence, Impartial Courts, Protection of
Property Rights), we obtained their principal component, which is then employed as a
summary measure of institutional quality. The results of the instrumental variables
regressions that use the principal component, reported in Appendix Table A2), are
consistent with previous results.10

In summary, the results reveal that the quality of

judicial institutions has a deterrent effect on dishonest and criminal acts, and it also reduces
people’s propensity to have dishonest attitudes.
Appendix Tables A3-A6 display the OLS counterparts of the instrumental variables
regressions reported in Tables 4, 5, A1 and A2. The signs and the statistical significance
of the coefficients are consistent between the OLS and IV specification with a couple of
exceptions. The magnitudes of the OLS estimates, however, are generally smaller than the
IV estimates.11

10

The correlations between the four measures of institutional quality are very high, ranging from
0.93 to 0.98.
Consistent with the IV results and the strong first stage, the reduced form results, displayed in
Appendix Table A7, show that the appointment procedure of judges and prosecutors are significant
determinants of the proclivity of illicit behavior and the propensity to approve of dishonest acts.

V. Extensions
Although we cannot identify the exact mechanism through which the quality of
judicial institutions influence the propensity for dishonest actions and the tendency to
approve of dishonest acts, an obvious pathway, as described in the introduction, could be
the relationship between perceived certainty of sanctions and the quality of judicial
institutions. More specifically, a decay in the quality of institutions is expected to reduce
the perceived certainty of punishment if a deterioration in judicial quality leads to
inefficiency and uncertainty in the criminal justice system.
In the ESS data the survey respondents are asked “How successful do you think
police are at preventing crimes in your country?” Options given ranged from 0 (extremely
unsuccessful) to 10 (extremely successful). Calculating the proportion of individuals
(weighted by survey weights) in each country who answered these questions as “
Successful” (choosing a rating of 6 or higher) shows that people’s beliefs about crime
prevention is positively correlated with actual judicial quality of the country, as depicted
by Figures 1A and 1B.12
Although we demonstrate that judicial quality of the country has an impact on
people’s propensity for dishonest behavior and on their dishonest attitudes, it can be
argued that the indicators of judicial quality may capture (or represent)
cultural/moral/ethical dimensions of the society. More specifically, cultural norms and
beliefs, which have an impact on individuals’ behaviors and attitudes, could also influence
the level of judicial quality in the country. Under this scenario, judicial quality would be

(Protection of property rights and the principal component) exhibited the same pattern as shown in
Figures 1A and 1B.

related to society’s general attitudes towards such concepts as fairness, equal opportunity,
trust, income/wealth, and family values. To test this conjecture we chose questions from
the ESS that were posed to the respondents to gauge their attitudes towards wealth, their
beliefs in whether people try to take advantage of them (being suspicious of others),
attitudes towards equality, and the belief in family being the main priority in life.
Specifically, we used the question in which the survey respondents were asked: “How
much is the person in this description like you? It is important for him/her to be rich.
He/she wants to have a lot of money and expensive things” Possible responses range from
1 (very much like me) to 6 (not like me at all). We created a dummy variable that takes the
value of 1 if the responded chose a value of 1 to 4 for this question, and zero otherwise, to
represent the belief that it is important to be rich. Similarly, we used the question: “How
much is the person in this description like you? He/she thinks it is important that every
person in the world be treated equally. She/he believes everyone should have equal
opportunities in life” to create a dichotomous indictor to represent the survey respondent’s
belief in equal treatment of others.
We also employed the question: “Do you think most people would try to take
advantage of you if they got the chance, or would they try to be fair?” to create a dummy
variable to indicate the belief that most people wouldn’t try to advantage of others.13
Finally, we used people’s responses to the statement: “A person’s family ought to be his or
her main priority in life,” and coded as 1 those responses that indicated agreement or
strong agreement with the statement.

13

Possible answers ranged from 0 (most people would try to take advantage of me) to 10 (most
people would try to be fair). A dichotomous indicator is created which takes the value of 1 if the
respondent chose a value of 5 or higher to answer this question.

21

Employing the same instrumental variables models used in the paper (Equations 1
and 2) and using these four dummy variables as outcomes, we found that indicators of
institutional quality have no statistically significant impact on these beliefs. The results,
displayed in Table 6 show that institutional quality, driven by the manner with which
judges and prosecutors are appointed, has no impact on these beliefs. These results
demonstrate that although judicial quality has an influence on the proclivity of illicit
behavior and that it impacts dishonest attitudes, judicial quality does not impact other
beliefs such as the importance of the family, believing in the fairness of people, believing
in fair treatment of others, and the importance of being rich.

VI. Summary and Conclusion
Institutions have an impact on economic interactions between agents, and they are
strongly related to economic performance of countries (Acemoglu and Robinson 2001),
Knack and Keefer 1995, North 1991, 1981), and there exist a number of pathways through
which institutional quality can interact with government policy and impact economic
development (Acemoglu and Johnson 2005, Rodrik et al. 2004, Hall and Jones 1999).14
Judicial system is an important component of the body of institutions in a country, and
North (1990) underlines the importance of the judicial system in the enforcement of
contracts to facilitate transactions to foster economic activity.
Institutions can also alter individual behavior to the extent that behavior responds
to the landscape of incentives, some of which are determined by institutions. For example,
judicial system’s lack of independence and courts’ lack of impartiality may provide a
14

economic development.

22

signal to the citizens about the ambiguity of judicial decisions. This may, in turn, lead to
an increased propensity to disregard the rule of law. Furthermore, increased and widespeared disregard of the rule of law and the ensuing illicit behavior may modify the social
norms in the society regarding the acceptability of unlawful and dishonest behavior.
In this paper we use micro data on residents of 25 European countries and employ
alternative measure of judicial quality (e.g. judicial independence, or the impartiality of
the courts) to investigate the extent to which the quality of judicial institutions has an
impact on individuals’ propensity for criminal and dishonest behavior and on their views
regarding the acceptability of such behavior. Acknowledging that the quality of judicial
institutions is endogenous, we employ as an instrument the procedures used in each
country with which prosecutors and judges are appointed to their posts. The manner in
which judges and prosecutors are appointed is expected to be related to the impartiality of
the judiciary. If the government has the authority to appoint judges and prosecutors at will,
they are more likely to be biased towards the government and towards those whose
interests are aligned with the government in comparison to judges and prosecutors who are
appointed to their positions following a written exam. Using the variation between
countries in appointment procedures, we show that these procedures, that are determined
by law or by the constitution of country, are strongly related to judicial independence,
indicating a strong first-stage relationship. Yet, the method of appointment is not expected
to have a direct impact on people’s propensity for dishonest behavior or on their tendency
to find dishonesty acceptable.
Empirical analyses show that the quality of the judicial institutions has a significant
impact on people’s propensity to break the law and on their propensity to declare dishonest

23

behavior acceptable. An improvement in the quality of judicial institutions, related to the
variation in the manner judges and prosecutors are appointed to their posts, reduces
people’s propensity to falsely claim a government benefit, to offer a bribe, to buy stolen
goods, to misuse or alter a document, and to make an exaggerated or false insurance claim.
In addition, we find that judicial quality alters people’s beliefs about the acceptability of
dishonesty and illegal behavior. An improvement in judicial quality reduces people’s
tendency to agree with the statement that “You cannot always act honestly if you want to
make money.” It also makes it less likely to find acceptable such acts as buying stolen
goods, concealing the faults of a good when selling it, making an exaggerated insurance
claim, cheating on taxes, and bribery.
Low judicial quality could be symptom of underlying cultural norms and beliefs.
In other words, judicial quality could be related to general attitudes in the society towards
concepts and beliefs such as fairness, equal opportunity, importance of income/wealth, and
so on. Using additional questions from the same survey, however, we find that judicial
quality does not impact other beliefs such as the importance of the family, believing in the
fairness of people, believing in fair treatment of others, and the importance of being rich.
In summary, the results reveal that the quality of judicial institutions has a deterrent
effect on dishonest and criminal acts, and it also reduces the propensity to have dishonest
attitudes, indicating that institutions help shape the beliefs of the society.
