ABSTRACT
This paper uses administrative tax data to examine the long-term effects of an experimental jobsearch assistance program operating in Nevada in 2009. The program required randomly-selected
unemployed workers who had just started collecting unemployment insurance (UI) benefits to
undergo an eligibility review and receive personalized job-counseling services. The program led
to substantial short-term reductions in UI receipt, and to persistent, long-term increases in
employment and earnings. The program also affected participants’ family outcomes, including
total income, tax filing, tax liability, and home ownership. These findings show that job-search
assistance programs may produce substantial long-term effects for participants and their families.

Introduction
Unemployment insurance (UI) programs typically require unemployed workers to actively

search for employment while collecting benefits. Over recent decades, job-search assistance
programs which are intended to help UI recipients meet these requirements have become
common in the United States and other developed countries. These programs typically involve
monitoring activities to ensure that UI recipients are conducting an active job-search and
provision of job-search assistance services to connect them with available jobs (Meyer, 1995;
Wandner, 2010; Card et al., 2010; Kahn, 2012). These requirements are expected to reduce UI
recipients’ negative incentives (moral hazard) and to improve the effectiveness of their job
search. Job-search assistance programs have become a larger part of the menu of governmentsubsidized employment and training programs, accounting for more than one-half of one percent
of the government budget and serving nearly one in every twenty workers in OECD countries
(Wandner and Eberts, 2014; Crepon and van den Berg, 2016).
Understanding the long-term effects of job-search assistance programs is important for
policymakers and academic researchers.1 However, because of data limitations and other factors,
most prior studies (which we discuss in more detail below) have focused on the programs’ shortterm impacts on unemployment duration, employment, and earnings, and provide limited
evidence on long-term effects. From a policymaker perspective, it is important to consider the
long-term impacts of these programs on participants’ earnings and tax outcomes when measuring
their cost-effectiveness. In particular, it is useful to consider whether these programs create
In addition to the motivation described here, we note that this paper is also relevant for tax policy. In particular,
this paper is derived from an original project titled “The Effects of Employment and Earnings on Tax Filing and Tax
Liability: Evidence on Short-term and Long-term Effects Using Administrative Tax Data.” Since forecasting tax
filing and tax liabilities are central components of tax policy, this project aims to understand how changes in
employment and earnings affect changes in tax filing and tax liabilities. This project exploits exogenous variation in
employment and earnings to estimate the causal effects of changes in employment and earnings on tax filing and tax
liabilities.

permanent increases in employment and earnings, and hence, increase state and federal income
tax bases. From an academic research perspective, it is important to establish whether job-search
assistance helps unemployed workers overcome barriers to reemployment (fixed costs) thereby
producing persistent increases in employment and earnings. Alternatively, the programs may
have transitory effects on employment, earnings, and income tax bases if their only impact is to
help treated individuals to find jobs faster than they would have in the absence of the programs.
This paper examines the long-term effects of an intervention implemented by the state of
Nevada in the second half of 2009. The intervention provided UI recipients with personalized
job-search assistance at the beginning of their UI spells. The Nevada program examined here is
a compelling case study because it used random assignment to determine which UI recipients
would be subject to program requirements (treatment group) and which would be exempted from
the program (control group). The program required individuals assigned to the treatment group
to meet with program staff at the early stages of their UI spells to undergo an eligibility review,
in which they provided information about their job-search activities. Those who failed to show
up for the review and those who were identified during the review as not conducting an active
job-search, as required by state UI laws, were disqualified from collecting UI benefits. Those
deemed eligible during the review, received personalized job-counseling services during the
same meeting, which focused on assessing their occupational skills, helping them develop a jobsearch plan, providing resume development assistance, and providing direct referrals to local
employers with relevant jobs.
The empirical analyses use 2001-2015 administrative tax records for all UI recipients who
were subject to random assignment for participation in the program (treatment and control
groups) during the study period. The data allow us to construct measures of individual earnings,

Page 2

UI receipt, and other outcomes based on third-party reported tax documents. In addition, we
measure tax filing and other family-level outcomes, such as tax liability, total income and home
ownership, based on filed tax returns. This information allows us to examine the program’s
effects on participants’ individual and family outcomes for a six-year period after entry into the
program.
Results indicate that the treatment had significant, long-term effects on wage employment
and earnings. The program increased the employment rates of participants in the year after the
intervention by about 8 percent relative to the control group, an effect that declined somewhat
over time, but remained in the 4-7 percent range over the subsequent five years. As a result, the
program increased participants’ earnings in the range of 11 to 14 percent over the entire six-year
follow-up period. These persistent, long-term effects suggest that the program increased
employment among individuals who would not have found jobs in the absence of the
intervention, as opposed to getting individuals who would have ultimately found jobs in the
years following the intervention to find them earlier. The program also led to a substantial
reduction in UI benefits collected in the two-year period after the intervention, when benefits
were still available under the claim associated with assignment into the program. In contrast,
there is limited evidence that the program affected self-employment rates or receipt of disability
benefits.
Results based on filed tax returns show that, in addition to affecting individual employment
and earnings, the program affected family-level outcomes. Treated individuals were more likely
to file tax returns and had higher total family income and tax liability relative to the control
group. These results are consistent with the program’s effects on employment and earnings, but
also indicate that the treatment may have had some positive spillover effects on spousal

Page 3

employment and earnings. Additionally, we find that individuals in the control group
experienced a steeper decline in home ownership rates in the three-year period following the
intervention than did treatment cases. As a result, treated individuals had significantly higher
home ownership rates than control individuals following the intervention. Treated individuals
may have been less likely to sell their homes or default their mortgages as a result of increased
employment and earnings.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses the institutional background of the
Nevada program and the data used in the analyses. Section III presents our methodology for
estimating program effects and the results of our analyses. Section IV compares our findings
with those of previous studies of U.S. job-search assistance programs, and discusses the possible
mechanisms behind the effects. Section V summarizes our findings and conclusions.

Background and Data

A.

The Nevada REA Program
There are two primary job-search assistance programs operating in the United States – the

Worker Profiling and Reemployment Services (WPRS) and the Reemployment and Eligibility
Assessment (REA) programs. Both programs target unemployed workers who start collecting
UI benefits, excluding those on temporary layoff, active in employment or training programs,
and attached to union hiring halls. The WPRS program, established in 1993, refers UI recipients
to public employment offices to obtain information about available job-search services and
referrals to specific services that would aid their job-search (Dickinson et al., 1999; Wandner,
2010). The program’s objective is to help participants find jobs quickly and produce savings for
the UI program. WPRS is federally-mandated and has been operational in all 50 states since

Page 4

1996.
REA was established in 2005 by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) to conduct in-person
eligibility reviews to confirm that UI recipients who are not served by the WPRS program are
actively searching for a job, as mandated by state UI laws (Benus et al., 2008). REA’s objective
is not to provide job-search assistance to UI recipients, but rather to reduce UI fraud by
disqualifying those who are not conducting an active job-search (Poe-Yamagata et al., 2012).
While WPRS is federally mandated, REA is voluntary, with DOL providing annual grants to
encourage states to implement the program. In 2009, which includes the period of our study, all
50 states were implementing WPRS while REA was fully operational in only nine states,
including Nevada. Since then, REA has expanded dramatically, and currently 33 states operate
the program.
The approach that Nevada used to implement the REA program differed from the approaches
of other states that operated both WPRS and REA. Instead of referring UI recipients not served
by WPRS to eligibility reviews, Nevada essentially combined WPRS with REA, creating an
REA program that required participants to participate in both the eligibility review and jobsearch services. Specifically, the Nevada REA program required participants to meet with
program staff in the first few weeks of their UI spell to undergo an eligibility review and, if
deemed eligible, to receive mandatory job-counseling services. The Nevada REA program
operated in the workforce regions covering the Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise and Reno
metropolitan areas, while WPRS operated in the rest of the state.2
The Nevada REA program operated as follows. Each week, the Nevada UI agency randomly

The two metropolitan areas where REA operated, covered about 87 percent of unemployed workers in the state in
2009 (source: authors’ tabulations of the 2009 American Community Survey).

assigned REA-eligible recipients into the treatment or control group.3 A notification letter was
sent out to treatment cases asking them to attend a meeting, typically scheduled in weeks 2-4 of
their UI claim, to undergo the review and receive job-counseling services. The letter informed
participants that failure to show up for the meeting would result in loss of UI benefits.
Individuals assigned to the control group did not receive such a letter or other program
communications, nor were they subject to any program requirements; however, they were subject
to the usual UI work-search requirements.
Individuals in the treatment group who did not show up for the meeting without a reasonable
justification were immediately disqualified from collecting additional UI benefits.4 Participants
who showed up for the meeting and were deemed to be noncompliant with UI work-search
requirements were also disqualified. Those who passed the review, were offered job-counseling
services during the same meeting, including an individual skills assessment, development of a
job-search plan focusing on jobs that were compatible with the participant’s skills, assistance in
developing a resume and other job application materials, and direct referrals to employers with
compatible job vacancies. These services were offered as needed, and not all participants
received all services. At the end of the meeting, participants were informed that, although they
were not required to receive additional services or attend follow-up meetings, they were expected
to continue actively searching for employment, as mandated by state UI laws. Poe-Yamagata et
al. (2012) report that dividing the total funding used to administer REA by the number of treated
individuals in 2009, yields a $201 average estimated cost per treated individual.

3
The proportion of REA-eligible UI recipients assigned to the treatment varied slightly on a weekly basis according
to the capacity of public employment offices to provide services in participants. Generally, each week, about 15
percent of eligible recipients were assigned to the treatment and 85 percent to the control group.

Participants who had found employment, participated in job-search or training services, or discontinued benefit
receipt were exempted.

Prior Evidence
A number of experimental studies have examined the effects of U.S. job-search assistance

programs, including the Nevada REA program examined here. Previous work focusing on the
United States has relied on participant data provided by state UI agencies. These data include: (1)
UI claims records, which report the number of weeks and UI benefit amounts collected under the
UI claim associated with program assignment; and (2) quarterly wage records, which report
quarterly earnings from private-sector employers in the program state. Based on available data,
previous work has generally focused on whether job-search assistance programs reduced the
duration of participants’ current UI spells and increased participants’ short-term employment and
earnings. In most cases, program effects on these outcomes were estimated for up to six quarters
after the intervention, and thus evidence on the program’s long-term effects is limited.
Meyer (1995) reported that programs targeting UI recipients in South Carolina, New Jersey,
and Washington during the 1980s reduced average UI spells, but had substantively small effects
on short-term employment and earnings. Studies of programs that operated in the mid-1990s
showed that requiring UI recipients to receive job-search assistance services reduced UI duration
and benefit amounts collected (Decker et al., 2000; Klepinger et al., 2002; Black et al., 2003).
This work provided mixed evidence about whether these programs affected participants’
earnings.
Prior studies have also established that the Nevada REA program was effective in improving
the short-term outcomes of UI recipients (Michaelides and Mueser, 2017; 2018). These studies
used Nevada UI data on all unemployed workers who started collecting UI benefits in the second
half of 2009, and who were subject to random assignment for participation in the program.5
During that period, the Nevada unemployment rate averaged over 12 percent, peaking at nearly 14 percent in 2010,
the highest in the state in 25 years. As a result, UI recipients were eligible for up to 99 weeks of UI benefits: 12-26

Both studies found that the program led to large reductions in UI spells and benefit amounts
collected and to substantial increases in employment and earnings. Michaelides and Mueser
(2017) compared the results of the Nevada REA program with the results of the WPRS program
in Florida and the REA programs in Florida and Idaho. Results showed that all four programs
reduced UI duration and increased earnings, but that the Nevada REA program was by far the
most effective.
There are also numerous experimental studies of job-search assistance programs operating in
many European countries, including Belgium (Cockx et al., 2017), Denmark (Graversen and van
Ours, 2008; Maibom et al., 2017), France (Behaghel et al., 2012), Germany (Krug and Stephan,
2013), the Netherlands (Gorter and Kalb, 1996), Sweden (Hägglund, 2011), and the United
Kingdom (Dolton and O’Neill, 2002). The European literature is nicely reviewed by Card et al.
(2010), Kahn (2012), and Crepon and van der Berg (2016). The programs studied by this work
have typically involved more intensive requirements than U.S. programs, requiring participants
to engage in job-search monitoring and job-counseling activities throughout their UI spells. By
comparison, U.S. programs typically require participants to engage in such activities only once,
at the beginning of their UI spells, with no requirements thereafter. The European studies have
found that job-search assistance programs are often very effective in increasing unemployment
exits and reemployment rates. However, lack of data did not allow in most cases examination of
effects on individual earnings or tax outcomes.

Data
Our study sample consists of all individuals who started collecting UI from July through

weeks under the regular UI program, 26-53 weeks under the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC)
program, and 10-20 weeks under the Extended Benefits (EB) program.
Page 8

December 2009 and were subject to random assignment for participation in the program. The
total sample size is 32,751 individuals, from which 4,673 individuals were assigned to the
treatment and the remaining to the control group.6 The analysis is based on two datasets: (1)
Nevada REA program data, provided by the Nevada Department of Employment, Training, and
Rehabilitation, and (2) administrative tax data, collected by the United States Internal Revenue
Service. The Nevada REA program data provide the following information for individuals in the
study sample: treatment status, birth date, gender, five-digit zip code, and quarterly earnings
from private-sector employers in Nevada from 2008 through 2011.
Our empirical analyses are based on identifying treatment and control group individuals from
the Nevada REA program in the administrative tax data. This identification is done using birth
date, gender, zip code, and annual wage earnings in 2009. These variables allow us to match
each individual in the Nevada REA sample to a unique individual in the administrative tax data.
The matching procedure is as follows. First, we use the administrative tax data to identify all
individuals who received UI benefits (i.e., had a 1099G tax form) from Nevada in 2009. For this
pool of individuals, we use the tax data to observe their date of birth, gender, zip codes, and
annual earnings. Then, we match individuals from the Nevada REA sample to the individuals in
the administrative tax data pool based on birth date, gender, zip code, and annual earnings.
Using this process, we are able to match all treatment and control group individuals from the
Nevada REA sample to unique individuals in the administrative tax data. To assess the validity
of the match, we compare short-term differences in the likelihood of employment (i.e., having
Note that this is the same sample used by Michaelides and Mueser (2018). As reported in that study, 956 (20
percent) of the 4,673 treatment cases did not undergo the review; of these, 34 were disqualified for failure to
undergo the review and the remaining 922 were exempted because they had already found a job or they had already
received job-search or training services. The remaining 3,717 (80 percent) treatment cases underwent the review; 34
of these were disqualified during the review because they were not conducting an active job search. Our study
sample includes all 4,673 treatment cases, regardless of whether they underwent the review, were disqualified, or
were exempted. Similarly, our study sample includes all individuals who were assigned to the control group.

positive W-2 wage income) and earnings amounts based on both the Nevada REA program data
and the administrative tax data. These results are presented in Appendix Figure 1. Overall, we
find that short-term treatment-control differences in earnings from the Nevada REA program
data appear to be consistent with differences in the administrative tax data. We conclude that the
matching appears valid and proceed with the empirical analyses of the panel data constructed
from the administrative tax data.
To assess whether there is treatment-control group equivalence in the matched sample, Table
1 presents summary statistics for the treatment and control groups and treatment-control
differences based on characteristics available in the tax data. As seen, treatment and control
cases were generally similar, with few substantive differences, which could be attributable to
chance. Moreover, Appendix Table 1 presents results from a regression model that estimates the
likelihood of treatment assignment based on pre-treatment covariates (reported in 2008) from the
administrative tax data. Overall, the pre-treatment covariates do not consistently predict
treatment assignment. As we discuss below, we confirm that the estimated treatment effects are
robust to controlling for pre-treatment characteristics and outcomes.
Lastly, we create a panel dataset based on administrative tax records for years 2001 through
2015. The administrative tax records include information reported by third parties, such as W-2
earnings and 1099-MISC tax forms,7 and information from filed tax returns. Using the thirdparty-reported information, we measure W-2 employment (whether an individual had W-2
earnings) and W-2 earnings amounts (as reported on Form W-2). We also measure whether

IRS Forms W-2 and 1099-MISC are tax forms that employers are required to submit to individuals and the IRS.
The W-2 document records annual wage, salary and tip income paid by the employer to the employee. The 1099MISC document records annual payments in excess of $600 to non-employees such as independent contractors.
Similarly, IRS Forms 1099-G and 1099-SSA record unemployment insurance and disability payments paid from
government agencies to individuals, and these forms are also reported to the IRS by state agencies and the Social
Security Administration respectively.

individuals had contractor employment (based on 1099-MISC forms), whether they collected UI
benefits (based on 1099-G forms), and whether they collected disability benefits (based on 1099SSA forms). For each of these income sources, we also observe amounts paid. Additionally,
home ownership is observed based on third-party reported mortgage interest statements.
Specifically, for each individual who owns a home and has mortgage payment to a lender, a 1098
Mortgage Interest statement is reported by the lender to the IRS for any mortgage interest
payment in excess of $600. Moreover, using filed tax returns, we measure additional outcomes at
the family-level, including whether the individual filed or was claimed on a tax return, spousal
earnings, self-employment income, total family income, tax liability, and tax balance due. We
note that, in contrast to outcomes based on third-party reported information documents,
outcomes based on filed tax returns are self-reported by individuals who file tax returns.

Empirical Analyses

A.

Regression Specification
Because individuals were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups, we are able to

estimate causal effects on participants’ outcomes using a standard Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
regression specification. Using

to denote an outcome of interest for individual i in year t, we

estimate treatment effects based on the following regression specification:
1

∗1

In this specification, the estimated coefficients

.

capture differences between the treatment and

control groups in each year. The analyses focus on differences between the treatment and control
groups in the years prior to random assignment into the program, as well as the short-term and
long-term differences between the treatment and control groups after random assignment.
Page 11

Examining whether there were any pre-existing differences between the treatment and control
groups provides a check to assess the validity of the random assignment. Treatment-control
differences after random assignment estimate the program’s average intent-to-treat treatment
effects on outcome variables. This regression specification is estimated using panel data on
multiple outcome variables, as discussed below.8
B.

Results
Figure 1 presents the first set of results for W-2 employment outcomes, based on third-party

reported tax forms. W-2 employment indicates whether the individual had a W-2 form with
earnings from an employer, and W-2 earnings measures the total amount of W-2 earnings from
all employers.9

Each plot presents the estimated treatment effects for each year and the

corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals (corresponding to the left vertical axis). The plots
also present the means of the outcome variable in each year for the treatment and control groups
(corresponding to the right vertical axis), facilitating a comparison of the treatment effects to the
relevant baseline means of the outcome variable.
Results in Figure 1A indicate that the program increased the likelihood of employment in
2010, the first year after program entry, by 5.3 percentage points, compared with a base
employment rate of 68.4 percent for the control group. Treatment effects on employment faded
slightly in subsequent years, ranging from 3.2 to 4.8 percentage points. The graphical evidence
indicates that this fade-out does not appear to be driven by a declining employment rate for the
treatment group. Instead, the employment rate for the control group appears to increase slightly
more over time relative to the rate for the treatment group, indicating that some individuals in the
control group who did not find jobs in the first year after the treatment may have ultimately

found jobs in subsequent years. Nevertheless, program effects on wage employment from 2011
through 2015 were positive and statistically significant, and do not appear to be statistically
different from the 2010 short-term effect. These results indicate that the program increased
employment rates in the entire six-year follow-up period. More specifically, the results indicate
that the employment rate for individuals in the control group did not fully catch up to the
corresponding measures in the treatment group. Thus, the program appears to have increased
employment among individuals who would not have found jobs in the absence of the treatment,
as opposed to getting individuals who would have ultimately found jobs to find them earlier.
Figure 1B illustrates that the program had positive and statistically significant treatment
effects on W-2 earnings in the six-year follow-up period. The program increased W-2 earnings
in 2010 (the year following program entry) by $2,076, compared with a base of $14,320 for the
control group. This effect appears persistent across the subsequent years, ranging from about
$2,369 to about $2,800, which represents an 11 to 13 percent improvement over the control
group mean.10 In addition to these outcomes, we also examined whether individuals in the
treatment group were more likely to move from their ZIP codes in 2008 (i.e. their ZIP codes at
the times of the treatment) following the intervention. We did not find any statistically
significant differences between the rates of moving for the treatment and control groups, so it
appears that the treatment increased W-2 employment and earnings within individuals’ initial
local labor markets.
We have also examined W-2 earnings conditional on employment. Appendix Figure 2 presents these results. The
results highlight that even beyond increasing employment, the intervention may have increased earnings conditional
on being employed. Specifically, average earnings conditional on employment appear to be roughly $1,500 higher
for the treatment group relative to the control group. Note that mean earnings conditional on employment for the
control group is roughly $30,000. These results suggest that the program may have helped participants find better
(higher-paying) jobs or that it may have been particularly effective at getting high-wage individuals to find jobs.
Similar to effects on employment, the effects of the intervention on earnings conditional on employment remain
persistent for up to six years after the intervention. However, we also acknowledge that these results may provide
biased estimates of the program’s impacts on conditional earnings because there could be unobserved differences
between treatment group individuals who became employed and control group individuals who became employed.

Figure 2 presents program effects in other forms of annual employment and income based on
third-party reports. Contractor employment indicates whether the individual had a contractor
1099-MISC form. Receipt of UI benefits indicates whether the individual collected UI benefits,
and amount of UI benefits measures the amount of UI benefits collected during the year. Receipt
of disability benefits indicates whether the individual collected disability benefits, and broad
individual income is the total amount of individual income based on third-party reports,
measured as the sum of earnings, contractor income, UI benefits, and disability benefits.
Figure 2A provides little evidence of substantive treatment-control differences in contractor
employment following the intervention. This result indicates that control group individuals did
not engage in self-employment activities to compensate for lost W-2 earnings at a higher rate
than did the treatment group. Figure 2B highlights that treatment cases were less likely than
control cases to have collected UI in 2010 and 2011, the period following the intervention, when
regular UI, EUC, and EB benefits under the original claim were still available. Expectedly, UI
benefit receipt declined for both groups after this period, possibly because benefit durations had
expired for most individuals and many of them did not qualify for subsequent UI claims.
Although treatment cases remained less likely than control cases to collect benefits, differences
lack statistical significance. Figure 2C shows that the program significantly reduced UI benefit
amounts collected from 2009 through 2011, the period when benefits were available under the
original claim, although only the 2010 effect was statistically significant. Overall, the program
reduced UI benefits collected a total of $818 from 2009 through 2011. The program did not
affect UI receipt outcomes in 2012 or later. These results indicate that the program’s effect on UI
receipt was short-lived and that, in fact, treatment cases were at least as likely as control cases to
return to UI in subsequent years. Figure 2D indicates that, while there were increases in the

Page 14

likelihoods of receiving disability benefits for both the treatment and control groups, there were
no statistically significant differences in the likelihoods of collecting disability benefits between
the groups after the intervention.
The broad individual income variable allows us to examine program effects in the total of all
these income measures (see Figure 2E). Results are similar with the W-2 earnings results
(Figure 1B), in that we get positive effects in the entire follow-up period. The smallest effect on
broad income – and the only one that lacks statistical significance – is observed in 2010, when
the substantial positive effect on earnings was partly offset by the large reduction in UI benefit
amounts collected. In each year after 2010, the intervention had large and statistically significant
effects on broad income, in the $2,000-2,500 range. The magnitude of the effects on broad
income in this period largely correspond to the program’s effects on W-2 earnings (see Figure
1B).
Our analyses now turn to examining program effects on outcomes based on filed tax returns,
so that we can assess whether the program affected outcomes at the family (tax-filing unit) level.
Figure 3 presents estimated effects on indicator variables based on filed tax returns: file tax
return indicates whether the individual filed a tax return or was included on a filed tax return;
spousal W-2 employment indicates whether the individual had a spouse with positive W-2
income on a filed tax return; has self-employment income indicates whether the individual had
income from self-employment reported on a filed tax return; and home ownership indicates
whether an individual or spouse (on the filed tax return) received a 1098 Mortgage Interest
statement indicating home ownership.
Figure 3A shows that the treatment group had a slightly higher likelihood of filing a tax
return in the years immediately following the intervention, with large and statistically significant

Page 15

effects in 2013, 2014, and 2015. These results suggest that, perhaps due to the program’s effect
on employment and earnings, treated individuals were more likely to file tax returns than control
individuals. Figure 3B shows a noticeable increase over time in treatment-control differences in
the likelihood of having a spouse with W-2 earnings. Program effects are not statistically
significant, except for 2015, when the 3.7 percentage-point effect is significant at the 10 percent
level. These results provide some evidence that the program may have had some positive
spillovers on spouses of treated individuals. Figure 3C shows no statistically or economically
significant impacts on the likelihood of reporting self-employment income on filed tax returns.
Importantly, it does not appear that individuals in the control group were more likely to turn to
self-employment to offset reductions in wage earnings relative to the control group.
Figure 3D indicates that the program may have had some positive impacts on home
ownership through increased employment and earnings. In particular, after the intervention,
home ownership rates declined more sharply for the control group than the treatment group.
Intuitively, individuals in the treatment group may have been less likely to sell their homes than
individuals in the control group because they were more likely to find employment and hence be
able to continue paying their mortgages. This evidence is consistent with recent evidence of
impacts of UI on housing markets (see Hsu et al., 2018).
Building on the above analyses, Figure 4 presents results using amounts from filed tax
returns, including individual W-2 earnings, spousal W-2 earnings, total family income, tax
liability, and the tax balance due. Because outcomes from tax returns are only available for
individuals who filed tax returns, for each of these outcomes, we use values based on filed tax
returns for tax filers, and we use values based on third-party reported information for non-filers.
Specifically, for W-2 earnings, we use earnings amounts reported on IRS Form 1040 for filers

Page 16

and total individual W-2 wages for non-filers; for total family income, we use total income
reported on IRS Form 1040 for filers and total broad income for non-filers; for tax liability, we
use total tax liability before credits on IRS Form 1040 for filers and total W-2 withholdings for
non-filers; for tax balance due, we use the balance due (or refund if negative) on IRS Form 1040
for filers and 0 for non-filers.
Results show that individuals in the treatment group had higher W-2 earnings than
individuals in the control group over the entire follow-up period. Spousal earnings also appear to
be higher for the treatment group, although effects are significant only in years 5-6 after the
intervention and at the 10 percent level. Figure 4C indicates that treated individuals had higher
total family income than control individuals following the treatment. In particular, the treatment
effects on family income are larger than the treatment effects on individual earnings because of
the positive effects on spousal income. Quantitatively, the results indicate that the treatmentcontrol difference in total family income increased from roughly zero in 2009 to roughly $4,400
in 2015. Finally, Figure 4D shows that treatment cases had higher tax liability than control cases
in the entire follow-up period, particularly in years 4-6, when effects are statistically significant.

C.

Robustness Checks
In some cases, there are differences in outcomes between the treatment and control groups in

the period prior to the intervention. For example, treatment cases were more likely than control
cases to have positive W-2 earnings from 2002 through 2005 (see Figure 1A). Similarly, there
are some treatment-control differences prior to the intervention in receipt of UI benefits, receipt
of disability benefits, home ownership, and spousal W-2 earnings. Because of these differences,
we verify that estimated effects on each outcome after the intervention (2010 and later) are

Page 17

robust to controlling for individual characteristics and outcomes prior to the intervention (before
2009).
Specifically, for each outcome, we estimated differences between the treatment and control
group in each year with no controls for pre-treatment characteristics or pre-treatment outcomes,
with controls for pre-treatment characteristics in 2008, and with controls for pre-treatment
characteristics and pre-treatment outcomes in 2001-2008. Table 2 presents results for four
selected outcomes: W-2 employment, W-2 earnings, broad individual income, and total family
income. Results show that estimated effects are all robust to a variety of controls. Similar results
are obtained for other individual and household outcomes – results are available upon request.
These checks add credibility to interpreting the post-intervention differences between the
treatment and control groups as causal effects of the program.

IV.

Discussion
To put the current results in context, we compare them with the results from earlier studies of

the Nevada REA program and from experimental studies of other job-search assistance programs
in the United States. The estimates from earlier studies are summarized in Table 3. Starting with
comparisons to earlier studies of the Nevada REA program (Table 3A), Michaelides and Mueser
(2017 and 2018) found that, in the first four quarters after program entry, the program increased
earnings by $1,854 and $1,740, respectively. The results in the present study indicate effects on
earnings that were higher at $2,076 in 2010 (a period which roughly corresponds to the fourquarter follow-up period of the earlier studies). Michaelides and Mueser (2018) also report
earnings effects of $752 in quarters 5 and 6 after entry, which is consistent with our finding that
the program increased earnings by $2,127 in 2011 (a period which roughly corresponds to

Page 18

quarters 5-8 after entry of the earlier studies). These comparisons show that the results of the
two earlier studies are within the 95 percent confidence intervals of estimates from the present
study.11
Estimated effects on UI receipt are similar between the current study and earlier studies of
the Nevada REA program. Previous studies showed that the Nevada REA program reduced UI
benefits collected under the claim associated with random assignment into the program by about
$1,145 and $976. Estimates from the current study indicate that effects on UI benefits were
lower ($818) based on the total differences in UI benefit amounts from 2009 through 2011.
Tables 3B and 3C presents estimated impacts from other experimental job-search assistance
programs that operated in the 1980s and 1990s respectively. Comparing the current estimates to
estimates from programs examined by these earlier studies highlights that the Nevada REA
program appears to have been more effective. As shown in Table 3B, Meyer (1995) reported
that programs targeting UI recipients in South Carolina, New Jersey, and Washington during the
1980s reduced benefit amounts collected by $68 to $150. These programs, however, did not
have any impacts on earnings in the year after program entry (all programs) or two to three years
after entry (New Jersey program).12 In percentage terms, the estimated reductions in UI benefit
amounts collected for these earlier programs are comparable to those for the Nevada REA
program, but earnings effects for the Nevada REA program are substantially larger and more
persistent.

Disparities between the present estimates and the prior estimates may be due to a variety of factors. For example,
prior estimates did not account for out of state employment or employment with public employers. Furthermore,
some individuals who receive W-2s may not be covered by UI; the current estimates are based on W-2s whereas the
prior estimates are based on UI data.
12
These three demonstration programs were implemented by DOL. The same study reports the results of programs
in Nevada and Wisconsin, which were designed and evaluated by state UI agencies. Results show that the Nevada
and Wisconsin programs reduced UI duration by 31 and 4 percent, respectively, but provide no analyses of earnings
effects. However, the author notes that the “DOL experiments are more carefully designed, implemented and
evaluated than the state experiments. Thus, their results should be accepted with greater confidence.”
11

Page 19

Table 3C summarizes results from programs that operated in the mid-1990s and required UI
recipients to receive job-search assistance services (Decker et al., 2000; Klepinger et al., 2002;
Black et al., 2003). All four programs examined by this work led to significant reductions in UI
benefit amounts collected. But this work found mixed evidence about whether these programs
affected participants’ earnings. Decker et al. (2000) found that the job-search assistance
demonstration program in Washington, DC improved earnings by about 10 percent, while the
Florida program had no earnings effects. Black et al (2003) found that the Kentucky WPRS
program had positive but short-lived effects on earnings and Klepinger et al., (2002) found that
the Maryland work-search demonstration program had no effects on earnings. Overall, the
effects of the Nevada REA program on UI benefits collected are larger than the effects of
programs that operated in the mid-1990s. Also, with the partial exception of the Washington, DC
JSA program, the effects of the Nevada REA program on earnings are generally larger and more
persistent than the effects of these other programs.
There are a variety of factors that may explain the Nevada REA program’s large and
persistent effects on employment and earnings, and why the program was more effective than
other U.S. job-search assistance programs. First, the Nevada REA program may have involved a
more intensive treatment than programs examined by prior experimental studies. Michaelides
and Mueser (2018) report that more than 68 percent of Nevada REA participants received jobcounseling services, with 56 percent receiving a skills assessment and assistance in developing a
job-search plan, and 21 percent receiving a direct job referral during the meeting.13 The same
study reports that other U.S. programs have provided a much lower level of services to
participants, with very small proportions receiving individualized job-counseling. In fact, based
Individuals in the control group could, on their own initiative, access these services. Michaelides and Mueser
(2018) report that fewer than 10 percent of control cases received job-counseling services.

13

Page 20

on comparisons with job-search assistance interventions in Florida and Idaho that did not include
job counseling, Michaelides and Mueser (2017) concluded that the Nevada REA’s jobcounseling services provided direct aid to participants’ job-search efforts.14
The value of job counseling has also been established by many experimental studies of
programs implemented in Europe (e.g, Gorter and Kalb, 1996; Dolton and O’Neill, 2002;
Hägglund, 2011; Crepon and van den Berg, 2016). Intuitively, intensive job counseling may
improve the long-term outcomes of participants by helping them to develop more effective jobsearch strategies and obtain sustainable jobs. Job counselling may guide participants who would
have otherwise conducted a more general (and less efficient) job search to focus their job search
efforts on jobs that are consistent with their skills. Job counseling may also provide direct job
referrals which, in some cases, may lead to the immediate reemployment of participants in jobs
that are compatible with their skills. Job counseling may also improve participants’ basic jobsearch skills (e.g., use automated job banks, develop professional resumes, and improve
interviewing skills), thereby reducing barriers or fixed costs to job-search. Lastly, job counseling
may reduce the psychic costs of job search and motivate participants to conduct a more active
search, particularly those who in the program’s absence may have lacked motivation or may
have been discouraged by lack of job options.
Another potential explanation why the Nevada REA program was more effective is that it
operated in a different labor market context than the programs examined by other studies.
Nevada REA was implemented during the Great Recession, a period when unemployment

14
Michaelides and Mueser (2017) compared the results of the Nevada REA with the results of REA programs in
Florida and Idaho. The REA programs in Florida and Idaho included UI eligibility reviews similar to the Nevada
REA, but in contrast to the Nevada REA treatment, the Florida and Idaho REA programs did not include job
counseling services. The comparison indicates that the Nevada program had larger short-term effects on UI spells,
employment, and earnings than the Florida and Idaho programs, suggesting that the additional job counseling
services offered by the Nevada program were a significant factor behind the larger estimated treatment effects.

Page 21

duration and the potential duration of UI benefits was much higher for Nevada REA participants
than it was for participants in previous programs.15 Thus, individuals in the control group in the
Nevada REA program may have been more likely to remain unemployed longer than control
group individuals in other programs. This implies that, compared with other programs, effects
produced by the early exit of some participants to avoid requirements in the Nevada REA
program may have been particularly large compared to similar effects from other programs.
However, Michaelides and Mueser (2017; 2018) indicate that much of the effect of the Nevada
REA program on UI exits appears to have emerged after participants received job counseling
services, rather than the threat or notification of program requirements.
Our findings also shed light on how the effects of job-counseling programs may affect other
individual and family outcomes.

There is no evidence that the program affected contractor

employment and self-employment, indicating that the program did not increase self-employment
at the expense of W-2 employment, nor did lack of salary job options pushed control cases to
resort to self-employment. We also find no evidence that the program affected receipt of
disability benefits, indicating that the reductions in UI receipt were not offset by increases in
receipt of disability benefits.

Compared with control group individuals, treatment group

individuals had higher total family income, were more likely to file a tax return, and had higher
total tax liability. The results also indicate positive – but statistically insignificant – effects on
spousal earnings, suggesting that the lessons learned from program participation may have been
transferred to other family members.

A key finding of this study is that treatment group

individuals experienced a smaller decline in home ownership in the first three years after entry
into the program than did individuals in the control group.

As a result, home ownership was

Whereas UI recipients participating in previous job-search assistance programs were typically eligible for up to
26 weeks of benefits, treatment and control cases in the Nevada REA studies were, on average, eligible for about 87
weeks of benefits (23 under regular UI, 46 under EUC, and 18 under EB).
15

Page 22

significantly higher for treatment cases throughout the six-year period following the intervention.
This finding indicates that the program’s treatment effects on salary employment and earnings
may have helped participants to avoid selling their homes or defaulting their mortgage debt.
Finally, we note that recent work on the effects of labor market policies have focused on
displacement effects.

These effects are based on the possibility that programs may help

treatment group individuals find jobs and improve their overall outcomes by displacing
individuals who were not served by the program but were also looking for jobs during the same
period. The empirical analyses presented here do not explicitly account for such displacement
effects. Because the experimental sample for the Nevada REA program was small relative to the
population of job seekers in Nevada at the time of the program, the estimated program effects
may not be affected by such displacement effects.

However, if the program were to be

implemented on a larger scale, it is possible that, due to displacement effects, the program’s
actual effects could differ from the estimated effects presented here.
There is mixed empirical evidence on this issue. Some studies provide direct evidence that
job-search assistance programs might have substantial displacement effects, particularly among
the long-term unemployed youth (Crepon et al., 2013; Feracci et al., 2010; Gautier et al., 2018).
Other studies suggest that the modest effects of regulations requiring increased job-search efforts
among UI recipients may also be due to displacement effects (Toohey, 2015; Lise et al., 2004).
In contrast, Graversen and van Ours (2008) observe that when a relatively small portion of the
target population is served by the intervention, it is unlikely that estimated effects are biased due
to displacement effects altering the outcomes of those not served by the program. Other studies
find that job-search assistance and employment subsidies have substantial positive impacts even
when they are provided to a large share of unemployed workers, suggesting the displacement

Page 23

effects are minor (Blundell et al., 2004; De Giorgi, 2005). Further, Martins and Possoa e Costa
(2014) conclude that displacement effects are not important and that targeted groups which
benefit from job-search assistance might not do so at the expense of other groups.

V.

Conclusion
Understanding whether job-search assistance creates permanent increases in employment or

if the effects are temporary is important for policymakers and academic researchers. This study
uses administrative tax data to examine the long-term effects of job-search assistance on
employment, earnings, and tax outcomes. The analyses focus on the Nevada REA program
which was administered in Nevada in 2009. Examining long-term effects of job-search
assistance in this context is compelling for a number of reasons. The Nevada REA program used
random assignment to determine whether program-eligible UI recipients would be assigned to
the treatment or the control group, provided a wider range of services to participants than most
U.S. programs studied to date, and prior evidence has indicated significant short-term effects on
participants’ individual employment, earnings, and UI receipt.
Our findings indicate that the Nevada REA program led to substantive increases in individual
employment and earnings, which were sustained for at least six years after program entry. This
suggests that the intensive job-counseling services provided by the program helped individuals
who would not have found jobs in the absence of the program to become employed and increase
their earnings. Results also show that the program led to substantial reductions in UI benefit
amounts collected, with UI savings exceeding program costs by more than four times. The
program did not affect receipt disability benefits, suggesting that reductions in UI receipt were
not offset by increases in receipt of other types of government assistance. Another key finding is
that the program had impacts on participants’ household-level outcomes including total income,
Page 24

tax filing, tax liability, and home ownership.

Overall, our findings show that job-search

assistance programs may produce substantial long-term effects for participants and their families
that extend beyond any short-term effects on employment and earnings for the individuals
directly receiving services.

Notes: The table reports estimated regression coefficients with standard errors cluster on individual in
parentheses below the corresponding estimates. Specifications with static controls defined in 2008 include:
indicators for age bin (<26, 26-34, 35-44, 45-54,55-64, >64), gender, age bin by gender, 2-digit NAIC, 3-digit zip
code, filing status, SSA-1099 receipt for disability or retirement, and 1099-MISC receipt. Specifications with pretreatment controls defined in 2001-2008 include indicators for 10-year age bins and gender, and, for each year
between 2001 and 2008, indicator variables for: SSA-1099 receipt, W-2 employment, spousal W-2 employment,
1099-MISC receipt, 1099-G receipt, filing status (single, joint, head of household, or missing separately), EITC
receipt and for $10k increments of W-2 earnings.

squares represent treatment-control differences based on the administrative tax data. For the program data, annual
values are based on aggregating quarterly values from the program data to the annual level. The 95 percent
confidence intervals are shown in vertical bands. Standard errors are clustered by individual.
