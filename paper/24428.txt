Estimating the Effects of a Large For-Profit Charter School Operator

NBER Working Paper No. 24428
March 2018, Revised April 2018
JEL No. I0,I21,J0
ABSTRACT
In this paper, we leverage randomized admissions lotteries to estimate the impact of attending a
National Heritage Academy (NHA) charter school. NHA is the fourth largest for-profit charter
operator in the country, enrolling more than 56,000 students in 86 schools across 9 states. Unlike
several of the other large for-profit companies that operate virtual charters, NHA only has
standard bricks-and-mortar schools. Our estimates indicate that attending a NHA charter school
for one additional year is associated with a 0.04 standard deviation increase in math achievement.
Effects on other outcomes are smaller and not statistically significant. In contrast to most prior
charter school research that finds the largest benefits for low-income, underrepresented minorities
in urban areas, the benefits of attending an NHA charter network are concentrated among nonpoor students attending charter schools outside urban areas. Using data from a survey of school
administrators in traditional public and charter schools, we document several aspects of school
organization, culture and instructional practice that might explain these positive effects.

I. Introduction
Charter schools have expanded rapidly over the past decade, with charter enrollment
growing from 2.4% to 6.2% of the public school population between 2008 and 2017 (National
Alliance for Public Charter Schools, n.d.; Snyder and Dillow 2015). Growth in this sector has
been particularly strong among schools that are part of large charter networks. The share of
charter school students in non-profit Charter Management Organizations (CMOs) grew from
10.6% in 2008 to 26.5% in 2017. The market share enjoyed by for-profit charters in Education
Management Organizations (EMOs) grew as well, and now EMOs educate roughly 20% of all
charter school students in the country (National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, n.d.).
Yet, evidence of charter school effectiveness is almost exclusively based on non-profits,
many (but not all) of which are independent or part of small management organizations. 1 In the
postsecondary sector, evidence indicates that students at for-profit colleges do far worse than
their peers at other schools, even controlling for underlying differences in student characteristics.
Those who attend for-profit colleges are less likely to graduate, take on far more debt, are more
likely to default on that debt, and do worse on the labor market than comparable college students
(Cellini and Turner 2016). Across all levels of education, it is difficult to monitor effort, which
may lead schools to skimp on inputs in order to maximize profits. In fact, this is sometimes
offered as a justification for the role of the public and non-profit sectors in education (Poterba
1996).
Given their very negative record at the postsecondary level, we might expect that forprofits would also harm students enrolled in elementary and secondary education. Indeed, the
following eight states currently ban for-profit charters: Alaska, Connecticut, Mississippi, New
Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Washington (National Alliance for Public
1

A notable exception is the research done on KIPP Academies (see, for example, Angrist et al., 2010).

Charter Schools, n.d.). Other states impose strict restrictions on for-profit charters, including
Massachusetts and Kentucky where evidence must be shown that the organization is a “proven
provider,” and Maine, which restricts for-profit management to virtual charters (National
Alliance for Public Charter Schools, n.d.). Additional states such as California are mobilizing to
restrict or ban for-profits (AB-406, 2017).
We provide the first lottery-based evidence on the effect of for-profit charter schools on
student outcomes. 2 Our analysis focuses on the universe of National Heritage Academy charter
schools in the state of Michigan. NHA is the second largest for-profit, brick-and-mortar charter
operator in the country, enrolling more than 56,000 students in 86 schools across 9 states. 3 A few
for-profit charter operators in the U.S. are larger than NHA but have a substantial (or solely) online schooling presence (K-12 Inc., Connections Academy, and Academica). The only larger
brick-and-mortar for-profit charter school operator is Charter Schools USA.
We leverage randomized admissions lotteries from 44 NHA schools between 2003 and
2012 to estimate their impact on student achievement. Contrary to the experience in the
postsecondary sector, we find that these for-profit schools improve some academic outcomes for
their students. Our estimates indicate that attending a NHA charter school for one additional year
is associated with a 0.04 standard deviation increase in math achievement. Effects on reading are
smaller (0.026) and not statistically significant. We find no significant effects (either positive or
negative) on attendance, grade progression, disciplinary incidents or special education
placement. The effects, while not as large as the marquee results from the high-profile Harlem
Children's Zone and Boston charters, are substantial.
2

Throughout the paper, the term “for-profit charter school” refers to a charter school managed by a for-profit
operator. For-profit companies are not allowed to hold a charter in Michigan.

operator websites. As a point of comparison, the well-known and frequently studied KIPP Charter School network
serves roughly 90,000 students in 209 schools (http://www.kipp.org/).

3

This result is somewhat surprising, but makes sense once we consider how funding
structures and incentives differ at for-profit charters and colleges. For-profit colleges are fully
funded by tuition, which is largely covered by the financial aid dollars that students bring with
them. The schools are unconstrained in the prices they can charge, and typically charge much
higher tuition than public colleges. For this reason, compared with public colleges, for-profits
have a much stronger incentive to enroll as many students as possible—even if those students are
not expected to succeed. The marginal revenue produced by a for-profit college student is far
higher than that generated by a student at a public college, which typically charges tuition prices
considerably below the marginal cost of educating a student. They can charge these artificially
low prices because of subsidies they receive from state and local governments.
In the elementary and secondary sectors, by contrast, for-profit charter schools cannot set
prices. They are barred from charging students for attendance, and receive the same, per-pupil
allocation from the state whether they are operated by a non-profit or for-profit management
organization. Hence, non-profit and for-profit charters receive the same marginal revenue.
Our analysis reveals another interesting finding. In contrast to most of the prior lotterybased charter impact literature which has consistently found that low-income, underrepresented
minorities in urban areas benefit most from attending the lottery schools, the largest impacts of
attending the NHA charter network are concentrated among non-poor students attending charter
schools outside urban areas. These findings further highlight the importance of exploring the full
range of possibilities in the large, diverse charter school sector.
To explore potential mechanisms, we leverage data from a survey administered to all
charter schools and a sample of traditional public schools in the same geographic areas as the
charters. The survey asked school administrators about a variety of school policies and practices

4

in five domains: instruction, school culture, organization and leadership, teacher compensation,
and time use. We find that NHA schools share many of the same practices as the highly effective
non-profit charters in Boston, New York and other urban areas, including a “No Excuses” culture
and a focus on extra time and frequent assessment in core academic subjects. This is particularly
interesting insofar as it suggests that the benefits of these practices and policies may generalize
beyond the types of students and neighborhoods previously studied.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section II, we discuss the prior
literature on charter schools, including research focusing on the performance of Michigan charter
schools. In Section III, we provide background on the charter school market in Michigan.
Sections IV and V describe our empirical strategy and data respectively. In Section VI, we
present our findings and Section VII concludes.

II. Prior Literature on Charters
There is a large literature on charter schools, including many studies that seek to estimate
the causal impact of attending charter schools on student academic achievement. A key challenge
in this literature is addressing the selection bias that stems from the fact that students and
families choose to attend charters.
A small but growing number of studies exploit admissions lotteries to account for such
selection. In general, these studies have found that urban charter schools have large and
statistically significant impacts on student performance (for example Abdulkadiroglu et al.,
2011; Dobbie & Fryer, 2011, 2015; Gleason et al., 2010; Hoxby & Murarka 2009). This research
includes several studies that focus on individual schools or schooling models. Angrist et al.
(2010) studied a KIPP middle school in Lawrence, MA and found positive effects. Gleason et al.

5

(2014) found similar results in a non-experimental study of 41 KIPP middle schools nationwide.
Dobbie & Fryer (2011, 2015) studied the Harlem Children’s Zone charter school in NYC, and
found very large positive effects.
The lottery-based studies find that non-urban charters do not systematically outperform
traditional public schools (Angrist et al., 2013, Gleason et al., 2010). Some research suggests that
the relative effectiveness of charters serving urban students is explained not only by the type of
students they serve (and the fact that charters seem to be more effective for students with lower
baseline achievement), but also by the fact that many urban charters employ a specific set of
policies and practices which has come to be known as the “No Excuses” model (Angrist et al.,
2013; Dobbie & Fryer, 2013).
While these lottery-based studies have strong internal validity, they have important
limitations. First, even collectively, such lottery-based studies have examined few charter
schools. Lottery studies to date have examined only 113 schools out of roughly 6,000 charters
operating in the U.S (Chabrier, Cohodes, & Oreopoulos, 2016). The present study will increase
that number by 44.
Second, most of these studies have focused on charter schools that enroll students at the
start of middle school and high school, because these students have pre-lottery achievement
scores that allow researchers to assess the randomness of the lotteries. As a result, an important
subset of charter schools has not yet been examined using lottery methods. This study examines
the performance of K-8 charter schools, helping to close this gap in the evidence.
Third, no lottery-based study to date has examined the effect of for-profit charter schools.
Nationwide, non-profit charters are certainly the most common, but for-profit schools represent a
substantial portion of the sector in many states. In Florida, 40 percent of charters are for-profit.

6

In Michigan, the state with the highest representation, for-profits enroll two-thirds of charterschool students. 4
While lottery studies are the “gold standard” from the perspective of internal validity,
there is also non-experimental evidence on charter schools. Booker et al. (2011) find that Florida
students attending charter high schools are more likely to graduate high school. Sass et al. (2016)
find that these students are also more likely to persist in college and have higher earnings in their
mid-twenties. A small but growing literature has begun to non-experimentally evaluate the
behavior and impacts of charters managed by for-profit operators. For example, Singleton (2017)
documents differences in per-pupil spending among for-profit operators in Florida and relates
them to student performance in Florida.
The Center for Research on Education Outcomes (CREDO) has produced several highprofile studies. CREDO constructs matching estimators of charter school impacts by using
student-level administrative data. CREDO matches charter students to traditional public school
students from the same feeder schools (the traditional public school a student attended the year
prior to entering a charter). Students are matched on demographic characteristics 5 and test scores
from the previous grade. 6 Each charter student may be matched with multiple observations, and
these comparison records are averaged into one “virtual control.” Their outcome is student
growth in achievement defined as the year over year difference in state standardized test scores
(normalized into z-scores relative to the state and grade-level distribution that year).

A 2013 CREDO analysis of impacts for roughly 5,000 charter schools across 27 states
finds that charter school students gain slightly more in reading and are no different in math
relative to peers in traditional public schools (CREDO 2013a). They note that the average effect
of charter schools in their sample has improved somewhat over time, due more to the closure of
ineffective schools than to the improvement among existing schools. Another CREDO report
that focuses on urban charter schools find that they are more effective than other charter schools,
generating positive growth in test scores on average (0.05 standard deviations in math and 0.039
standard deviations in reading), and are especially effective for poor and minority students
(CREDO 2013b). Finally, a 2017 CREDO report examined charters by organizational structure,
comparing independent charters to CMOs, vendor operated schools, and hybrids. 7 This report
generally finds that schools within a network perform better than individual charters or
traditional public schools.
Several studies have looked at the evolution of charter schools over time. Studying
charters in Texas using administrative data and a non-experimental design, Baude et al. (2016)
find the effectiveness of charter schools in the state has increased over time due to exits from the
sector by less effective charter schools, improvements of existing charter schools and expansions
of effective charter management organizations. However, the authors also note that an
increasingly positive selection of students might help explain the rising performance. A similar
study in North Carolina by Ladd et al. (2017) finds that charter schools in that state have been
shifting to serve a more affluent and white population of students over time. They conclude that
the shift in the type of students enrolling in charters explains a corresponding rise in value added
estimates for charter schools over the same period.
7

The organizational classifications differ from those used in this paper. CMOs are networks where the operator
holds the charter and there are more than three schools. Vendor operated schools provide services to at least three
schools, but do not hold the charter.

Prior Evidence on Michigan Charter Schools
The most recent evidence on charter schools in Michigan comes from CREDO (2009,
2013a, 2015, 2017). Most relevant for this study are the findings from the 2013 and 2017 studies,
which produced estimates for the NHA network specifically (although these were not confined to
campuses in Michigan and estimated the average impact over 71 schools in 2013). According to
CREDO (2013a), NHA charters caused a statistically significant 0.03 standard deviation
improvement in reading test scores relative to “virtual twins” at traditional public schools and a
0.04 standard deviation improvement in math test scores. These are assumed to be linear effects
per year enrolled. When scaled linearly, this would translate to a 0.36 standard deviation
improvement in math for a student who enrolled in kindergarten and stayed through eighth
grade. The 2017 study paints an even rosier picture, and estimated that an additional year at an
NHA school is associated with a 0.14 standard deviation increase in math scores and a 0.11
standard deviation increase in reading scores.
Several other studies have looked at charter school impacts on test scores in Michigan
during the late 1990s. Eberts and Hollenbeck (2001) ran student-level regressions controlling for
observable characteristics and prior test scores, estimating that charter schools cause students to
score 2-4% lower on math in 4th grade. Using school-level data, Bettinger (2005) estimates a
difference in differences and lagged dependent variable model comparing charter schools to
traditional public schools within five miles and finds null or negative impacts of attending a
charter school on average.
Bettinger (2005) also estimated the effect of charter school entry on traditional public
school students’ test scores. This is part of a rich literature on charter school spillovers in

9

Michigan that has looked at the impact of charter schools on enrollment in traditional public
schools, fiscal health at traditional public schools, and enrollment in private schools, usually
finding a negative impact of charter school entry (Ni, 2009; Chakrabarti and Roy, 2010; Arsen
and Ni, 2012; and Arsen et al., 2015).
Overall, the CREDO results support the conclusion that urban charters in Detroit, and the
NHA in particular, are improving student test scores. Earlier Michigan-focused studies seem to
argue the opposite. All of these studies are vulnerable to selection bias.

III. Background on Charters in Michigan
Charter schools first arrived in Michigan in 1994 following legislation passed in 1993.
They serve a large and growing proportion of public school students in the state. As of the 201516 school year, there were 359 charter schools in Michigan, educating about ten percent of the
state’s students (Figure 1). The sector has expanded rapidly: in 2003, 204 schools enrolled less
than four percent of the state’s students. Across the state, charters enroll nearly 150,000 students.
As of 2014, there is no cap on charters in Michigan (except for virtual, online charter schools). 8
Over two-thirds of states cap the total number of charter schools (including Massachusetts and
New York).
The majority of charter funding comes from the state and is currently equal to the
minimum per-pupil allowance for traditional public schools. In 2014-2015, the per-pupil
allocation from the state was $7,391. 9 However, charters can raise additional funds through
private donations (if non-profit), investment (if for-profit), and are eligible to apply for local and
federal grants just as any public school would be. They have more leeway to charge fees for
8

initially a cap, a 2011 law raised the cap to 300 through 2012, 500 through 2014, and removed it thereafter.

services such as transportation. In 2014, the average, per-pupil expenditure was $9200 for charter
schools, and $9600 for traditional publics. In contrast to traditional public schools, however,
charter schools must pay for capital costs (such as their building) out of these funds as well.
According to the Center for Education Reform, charters are funded at about 64 percent of their
district counterparts on average. Across the country, they average $7,131 in per-pupil
expenditures compared to the average of $11,184 in the traditional public schools in 2009-2010.
It is also common for charter schools to receive no additional funding for school facilities
(Rebarber & Zgainer, 2014).
The charter landscape in Michigan differs from that in many other states in several
important ways. 10 While the charter laws are not consistently more or less stringent than other
states, they are notably looser when contrasted to Massachusetts and New York, two states where
charter schools have been studied extensively. Anyone can apply for a charter, and multiple
authorizers receive, review, and decide upon these applications. By contrast, about half of states
with charter laws have only one authorizer. In Massachusetts, school districts can authorize
charter schools, but the only other authorizer is the state itself. Michigan’s authorizers also
oversee the operation of charters, receiving a share of the state allocation to compensate them for
their effort. Authorizers in Michigan include public universities, community colleges, traditional
K-12 school districts, and intermediate school districts.
The guidelines for authorizing, evaluating and renewing a charter are not precisely
specified by state law. While the Michigan Council for Charter School Authorizers has a
common set of standards for approving and renewing charter applications, these are not
mandated by law (National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, n.d.). Thus, authorizers have
10

Information on state charter laws and policies comes from the National Alliance for Public Charters Law
Database, the Michigan Dept. of Education FAQ website “Michigan Charter Schools - Questions and Answers”;
Rebarber & Zgainer, 2014; the Michigan legislature (MI, 2011); and the Education Commission of the States.

11

considerable discretion in creating their own protocols for assessing charter applicants, selecting
charter board members, and evaluating a charter’s performance, including the timeline for
renewal. 11 These provisions are placed in a charter contract. If a charter fails to meet the
standards laid out in the contract, the consequences are at the discretion of the authorizer. One
exception is if a charter has been operating for at least four years, is in the bottom 5% of all
public schools in the state, and is in its second year of restructuring sanctions, in which case the
state does require revocation of the charter (National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, n.d.).
Although the intent of the law is clear (an authorizer must hold a charter school accountable),
there are few mandated guidelines for how to implement accountability protocols.
Michigan is among states that require the authorizer to evaluate and renew the charter,
although it does not specify an explicit timeline for renewal. In Massachusetts and New York,
the state takes an active part in evaluating and renewing charters. In the former, the state is the
sole authorizer (except for districts themselves), and in the latter, the state evaluates schools in
addition to the authorizer.
The management and ownership structure of Michigan’s charters is also distinctive.
Nationwide, charters are typically non-profit organizations that are locally managed. That is,
they are not part of a national network or chain. The next most common arrangement is a nonprofit charter attached to a network, such as the KIPP schools. These non-profit charter networks
are often called charter management organizations (CMOs).
In sharp contrast, Michigan is dominated by for-profit schools that are connected to a
national network. Michigan has more for-profit charters – by far – than any other state. Twothirds of Michigan’s charter schools are run by for-profit operators, known as education
management organizations (EMOs); see Figure 2. In 2015-2016, 74% of Michigan students
11

Only urban charter high schools have a mandated timeline for renewal, which is 10 years (MI, 2011).

12

enrolled in a charter school were attending a school managed by a for-profit. In all other states,
only a minority of charter schools are operated by for-profit firms; in New York and many other
states, they are prohibited outright. The only state that comes anywhere close to Michigan on this
dimension is Florida, where 40 percent of charter schools are run by for-profit firms.

Characteristics of Michigan Charters
Charter schools are concentrated in Michigan’s urban areas. Roughly half of charters are
in cities, compared to 14.5 percent of traditional public schools (Table 1, Columns 1 and 2).
Charters therefore reflect the demographics of cities, with their students more likely than those at
traditional public schools to be Black (54 percent vs. 16 percent), Hispanic (nine percent vs.
seven percent) and economically disadvantaged (73 percent vs. 47 percent). Standardized scores
are substantially lower in the charter sector than in traditional public schools: the gap is about 0.4
and 0.3 standard deviations in math and reading, respectively. Charters and traditional public
schools also differ in the share of students who are categorized as English learners (nine percent
and six percent, respectively), though they are relatively close in the share of students who
qualify for special education (about 13 percent in both sectors).
Given that they dominate the state’s charter sector, the profile of Michigan’s for profitschools (Table 1, Column 3) closely tracks that of charters overall (Column 2). A more
instructive contrast is with the non-profit charters in the state (Column 5). For-profit charters,
compared to non-profits, are less concentrated in urban areas (46 percent vs. 55 percent) and
more concentrated in the suburbs (40 percent vs. 18 percent). For-profit schools enroll a greater
share of White (36 percent vs. 28 percent), Hispanic (nine percent vs. six percent) and Asian

13

(four percent vs. one percent) students than the non-profits. They enroll a smaller share of Blacks
as non-profits (50 vs. 62 percent).
Charter schools also differ from traditional public schools in their grade structure. Over
35 percent of Michigan’s charter schools combine elementary and middle grades, compared to
about four percent of traditional public schools (Table 1, Columns 1 and 2). In the traditional
public schools, the standard progression is from an elementary school to a middle school, with
the transition at grade six or seven, depending on the district. A typical charter-school
configuration in Michigan enrolls children from kindergarten through eighth grade, with some
also providing pre-kindergarten.

National Heritage Academies (NHA) Charter Schools
The first NHA charter opened its doors in 1995. Since the inception of the first NHA
school in Grand Rapids, the NHA network has expanded to 86 schools in nine states, with over
half located in Michigan. Currently NHA is the largest charter operator in Michigan with 48
schools operating in 2016.
NHA schools served 5% of all third through eighth graders in Michigan in 2015-2016, or
about 47% of all charter students in those grades. Figure 2 plots the share of Michigan students
attending a school in the NHA network, as well as the share enrolled in any charter managed by
a for-profit EMO. The figure shows most of the growth in charter school enrollment since 2003
has come from for-profit charter schools. In addition, enrollment at NHA has grown steadily, if
not quite as quickly as charter enrollment overall.
Table 2 compares NHA schools with other charter schools in the state, as well as with
traditional public schools. For the purpose of comparison, we only show schools that serve

14

elementary or middle school students. The statistics are from the 2011-12 school year, when the
data for this study was first collected, although the general patterns remain the same today.
Unlike the schools featured in many other lottery-based charter studies, NHA schools are
not found predominantly in urban areas, as the network itself did not originate in Michigan’s
largest urban center, Detroit. Table 2, column (5) shows that almost half of NHA schools are
located in suburban areas, with 40 percent in urban areas and 12 percent in towns or rural areas.
Figure 3 shows the location of NHA schools across the state. The student demographics reflect
the geographic distribution as well. Students served by the NHA are less likely to be Black and
more likely to be Asian, Hispanic, or White than students enrolled in other charter schools in the
state. Likewise, the share of NHA students who qualify for free or reduced price lunch is lower
on average than other charter schools at 61% relative to 71% in columns (5) and (2) of Table 2,
respectively.
Like other charter schools, NHA schools have a higher proportion of novice teachers
relative to traditional public schools (7.7 percent vs. 1.1 percent). Similarly, the percent of
teachers each year who are new to an NHA school is higher than in traditional public schools
(19.5 percent vs. 11.7 percent).

The NHA Model
In contrast to some other charter organizations, NHA maintains full operational control
over all of its schools, meaning they make all decisions including for hiring, training, and

15

curriculum. 12 Generally organized as K-8 schools, the stated mission of the NHA is to develop a
student’s academic ability in tandem with her moral character.
The curriculum at NHA charters focus on math, social studies, science and literacy.
Initially, curriculum was based on the Core Knowledge program, founded by E. D. Hirsch Jr. at
the University of Virginia. Later, the NHA developed its own curriculum based on the ACT
college-readiness standards and the subject areas covered by state tests. The curriculum now
represents a combination of commercially-purchased curricular tools and internally-developed
resources in order to better align to state standards and college readiness expectations.
However, the NHA network retains some unique features. NHA schools advertise a
philosophy of partnering with parents to “reinforce the moral guidance a child receives at home,”
with a moral focus curriculum that is worked into the school day in many different ways. For
example, each month a secular virtue, modeled on Plato’s cardinal virtues, is integrated into
lessons. Readings may focus on themes related to the virtues, which include wisdom, respect,
gratitude, self-control, integrity, perseverance, courage, encouragement, and compassion. 13 And,
in the past, the social studies and history curriculum has had a distinctly patriotic and Americacentric perspective.
As discussed in more detail later, the instructional approach in NHA has several features
that distinguish it from most traditional public schools. NHA schools somewhat more time to
core academic subjects of math and ELA than other schools. In addition, they are much more
likely than other schools to group students by ability level for instruction in core subjects,
particularly math.
12
In contrast, at KIPP, the largest nonprofit charter networks, individual schools license the KIPP name, which the
national organization can revoke if a school is considered to be out of compliance with KIPP goals and standards,
and no school staff are employed by the national KIPP organization (Angrist et al. 2011).
13
The distinctive focus on character and virtue have occasionally generated controversy, including a lawsuit by the
ACLU which was dismissed in 2000 that accused one academy of promoting religious education.

16

According to NHA staff, however, the most important feature of the NHA model is an
emphasis on professional and leadership development. 14 In other schools, the principal or other
top administrators are constrained by time and other responsibilities which make it difficult to
respond to challenges within individual classrooms in a timely manner. Central to the school
level leadership structure is what NHA refers to as the “Dean Model.” At each school, three or
four deans each govern a hall or wing (e.g., K-2, 3-5, 6-8) and manage about 15 direct reports.
The day-to-day duties of a dean vary by school, but their primary goal is to coach the teachers.
This relatively small administrator-to-teacher ratio allows deans to provide teachers with
frequent and specific feedback. In addition, deans are responsible for duties such as overseeing
student culture, managing parent relationships, and participating in teacher recruitment. At NHA,
the principals meet weekly with the deans to set goals and train them to effectively coach the
teachers. This approach frees up the principal to manage the larger logistics of the school.
NHA schools place a high priority on developing talent within their schools. Beginning
with teachers, NHA has developed a clear framework for developing goals and fostering growth.
As teachers grow in their capacity and skills, they have opportunities to take on leadership roles
within the school. In particular, high-performing teachers are identified by their principals to
enter into the Dean Prep Academy. The Academy is a year-long online program which
introduces teachers to the mindset and skills of an effective dean with the goal of investing in
and preparing them to become a dean. All new deans enter into a two-year program that
combines online sessions and in-person trainings that is specifically designed to meet the needs
of new deans. After the first two years, all deans continue to participate in ongoing professional
development at the school, regional, and national level.

14

Much of the description of NHA in this section is based on personal communications with various NHA officials
during 2017 and 2018.

17

NHA has developed additional leadership opportunities to maintain their highest
performing deans. Deans who are not looking to become principals can serve as dean content
leaders, which enables them to lead some of the professional development during regional
meetings or participate in mentoring of new deans. Aspiring principals are selected to enter the
Principal Prep Academy which prepares them to lead their own NHA school within one to two
years.
The Principal Prep Academy is similar in structure to the track for deans, exposing
candidates to all aspects of what is required of principals including foundational NHA
procedures such as instructional leadership and data-driven instruction, developing school
culture and a high performing staff, and school accounting and budgeting. New principals
participate in a two-year new principal program to help ensure a smooth transition. Additionally,
both principals and deans participate in an annual four-day leadership summit each summer.
High performing principals are chosen to become executive principals, which requires them to
visit other schools to provide feedback and support, and beyond these established tracks may
move on to higher level positions at NHA.

IV. Empirical Strategy
The existence of admission lotteries simplifies the analysis dramatically. Assuming that
the lotteries were indeed random, which we verify below, we can estimate the Intent-to-Treat
(ITT) impact of charter schools simply by comparing outcomes of lottery winners and losers.
Lotteries occur by grade, school, and year. A student would apply, for example, to enroll
in the first grade of School A for school year 2016-17. If that school-grade-year combination is

18

over-subscribed, a lottery is held. Lotteries are therefore uniquely defined in our data by the
interaction of school, year and grade dummies.
However, many students apply to more than one lottery. Since lotteries are independent,
the probability a student wins will rise with the number of applications she makes. Further,
admissions probabilities vary across schools. Following Abdulkadiroglu et al. (2011), we define
a lottery risk set as the group of non-degenerate lotteries to which a student applied. 15 To
estimate the ITT, we regress outcome y for student i on an offer indicator and additional
covariates:

yikτ=
β 0 + initialofferikτ t β1 + X i Γ + γ kτ +ε ikτ t
t

(1.1)

where y is an outcome for student i in year t in risk set k in year τ . We define initialoffer to take
a value of one if a student wins at least one lottery within her risk set. A set of lottery risk-set
fixed effects ( γ ) limits the comparison to winners and losers within the same lottery. Student
covariates, X, can increase the precision of estimates. The coefficient β1 provides a consistent
estimate of the impact of winning at least one lottery to an NHA school. In most models, we
present standard errors clustered by the risk-set, although we also show that clustering by student
or the school attended in year t yields similar inferences.

Testing for Covariate Balance & Differential Attrition
Table 3 contains sample means for students in the analysis sample, pooled and separately
by lottery status. Half of NHA applicants are female, while 27 percent are Black and seven

15

Suppose, for example, student 1 applied to lotteries A and B, student 2 applied to lotteries B and C, student 3
applied to lottery A only, and student 4 applied to lotteries A, B and C. In this case, the risk set for students 1 to 4
would be AB, BC, A, ABC. In our analysis, we identify the impact of charters by comparing students within lottery
risk set. Hence, in the example above, student 1 would not serve as a comparison for student 2 even though both
applied to lottery B.

19

percent are Hispanic. Applicants live in census block-groups where the median income is
$64,632. The average age at application is 6.6 years, reflecting the fact that most apply by first
grade for admission. For this reason, baseline test scores, reduced price lunch eligibility, special
education eligibility, and limited English proficiency are only reported for students who were
enrolled in Michigan public schools prior to the lottery, or about 40 percent of students. Means
and adjusted differences in Table 3 for these outcomes are only for students with pre-lottery
characteristics, and reported in columns (5) through (8).
To test for correlations between these characteristics and lottery status, we run
regressions of the listed variables against the instrument and risk-set dummies. There are no
significant differences by lottery status, except for age at application. Those who win the lottery
are 0.015 years younger, which while statistically significant, is small in magnitude and plausibly
due to chance. Joint tests of significance fail to reject the null.

Estimating the Impact of Attending an NHA School
To obtain the impact of the local average treatment effect of attending an NHA school,
we estimate the following instrumental variable model:

yikτ=
β 0 + cumyrsikτ t β1 + X i Γ + γ kτ +ε ikτ t
t

(1.2)

where cumyrs measures the number of years student i attended an NHA school in the risk set
between the time of the lottery (τ) and the current year (t). The first stage model is:

cumyrsikτ=
α 0 + initialofferikτ tα1 + X i Α + γ kτ +uikτ t
t

20

(1.3)

V. Data
This analysis focuses on the National Heritage Academies. We collected application data
for lotteries that took place between 1999 and 2012 in 46 NHA schools (unless otherwise noted,
we denote academic years by the Spring year, so that 1999 refers to the 1998-99 academic year).
Each school is responsible for managing its own application and admissions process, and
is required to hold lotteries to allocate spaces for any year-grade that is oversubscribed. NHA
stores the records centrally. For some schools, we obtained electronic records on all applicants
that included information on which applicants were offered spots. Some schools also had
physical “lottery boards” in which the names of applicants and their lottery results were
recorded. Data from these boards were entered by hand and checked for accuracy. Our resulting
records include school name, year of the lottery, grade to which the student is applying, and the
student’s student name, birthdate, gender, home address, and ethnicity. Appendix A provides
more detail on the data collection process and the type of information we obtained.

Construction of Lottery Instrument
Students can apply to as many NHA schools as they like; the lotteries are independent,
both statistically and administratively. When admitted students decline a seat, spots open for
students farther down the lottery waitlist. Thus, some students are offered spots immediately,
while others are offered admission later.
In theory, this allows for two binary charter instruments: initial offer and ever offer.
Initial offer is an indicator variable set to one if a student is offered a seat at a school in the
applicant’s risk set at the time of the lottery. Ever offer is equal to one if initial offer is one, but
also counts offers made after the lottery, as the schools move down their waiting lists.

21

In practice, initial-offer records are kept meticulously by NHA, but only about 75 percent
of schools maintained consistent data on whether they ever offered admission to a student. We
therefore focus on the initial offer instrument. Appendix B provides additional detail about the
construction of these instruments.

Sample Construction
We begin with 79,459 applications to 2,907 lotteries at 46 NHA schools. We apply a
series of restrictions to obtain the final analysis sample, as outlined in Appendix Table 1.
Because state administrative data does not exist prior to 2001, we focus on lottery records
collected for the years 2002-12. We exclude roughly eight thousand applications of children who
had siblings enrolled in the school and thus did not participate in the lotteries. In addition,
applications by individuals who are never observed in Michigan public schools in any years
following the lottery are dropped. These students will have enrolled in private school or
homeschool, or left the state. A key concern for the analysis is whether this type of sample
attrition is correlated with lottery outcomes, as would be the case if lottery losers were more
likely to enroll in private schools, for example. This type of sample selection could bias the
estimates if lottery losers who chose to attend private schools were systematically different than
lottery losers who chose to attend traditional public schools. As described in the next section,
there is no difference in the match rate for lottery winners and losers.
We drop the small number of applicants who either previously attended the school or
previously won a charter lottery (to the same or different school). As described in the prior
section, the preferred estimation strategy utilizes one observation per student and controls for
lottery risk sets.

22

A more important restriction, both conceptually and empirically, is that we limit the
analysis to students applying to non-degenerate lotteries – that is, lotteries in which there is at
least one winner and one loser. If all (or no) students in a lottery are offered admission to the
school, there is no win-lose contrast to estimate and the lottery cannot contribute to the analysis.
This restriction reduces the number of applications by nearly half, to about 31,000 (from about
57,000) and to 749 lotteries (from 2,809) for 44 schools (out of 46).
Students in degenerate risk sets, that is risk sets where all the students received an offer
of admission or all failed to receive an offer, are also omitted. This removes an additional 4,157
applications and 14 lotteries. We are left with an analytical sample of 27,143 applications to 735
lotteries at 44 NHA schools, with 20,255 unique students.
We are able to observe at least one post-lottery achievement score for 90% of students in
the sample. We observe outcomes through grade 8 for roughly 51% of students in the sample,
and through grade 12 for about 15%. For this reason, we limit the analysis to outcomes measured
through grade 8. A little over 55% of lottery applications are for kindergarten entry, the most
common entry grade for the NHA. The next most common application grade is first, at just under
10% of applications. Applications to grades pre-K and 2nd through 6th each make up about four
or five percent of the sample. Finally, only one or two percent of the sample are applications for
8th or 7th grade, respectively.

Matching to State Outcome Data
We matched charter school applicants to administrative data from the Michigan
Department of Education (MDE) which included all students enrolled in any Michigan public
school (including charter schools) from 2002-03 through 2015-16.

23

Because neither lottery records nor state data contain a common unique identifier such as
social security number, we relied on name, date of birth, gender and ethnicity to match records.
We used probabilistic as well as exact matching techniques to account for minor misspellings,
nicknames, date and month swaps in date of birth, and other common errors. Appendix C
provides more detail on the matching.
We matched 93 percent of lottery application records to the state data. We find no
statistically significant differences in the match rate of lottery winners and losers, as shown in
Appendix Table 2. This table shows estimates from regressions in which the dependent variable
is a dummy indicating a match to the state data. Paralleling our analysis of outcome effects, these
regressions include risk-set dummies. The coefficient on the indicator for winning a lottery is
small in magnitude (less than one percent) and statistically insignificant.

Outcome Measures
Administrative records from the MDE provide information on the school of enrollment
and achievement scores. To facilitate comparisons over time and with previous research, we
focus on scores in math and reading, which occur in grades three through eight. We standardize
exams by grade, year and subject to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. We also
examine grade retention, special education placement, and disciplinary incidents as well as for an
indicator for scoring within the “proficient” range as defined by the state of Michigan. 16

16

This definition changed over the span of the analytic sample, because the state raised the threshold for proficiency
in 2011. We have coded the definition consistently, applying the more stringent threshold to all years of data.

24

VI. Results
Table 4 presents first-stage estimates of the relationship between lottery offer and
enrollment in an over-subscribed NHA charter school in the fall after the lottery. Recall that the
instrument here is a dummy indicating that an applicant won admission at the time of the lottery;
that is, she received an initial offer.
Lottery winners are 19 percentage points more likely than lottery losers to enroll in an
NHA school the following fall. The F-statistic on this estimate is 97.75. The control mean
indicates that a third of those who lose the lottery still manage to enroll in an oversubscribed
NHA charter in the fall after the lottery. These are likely applicants from the randomly-ordered
waitlists who received an offer after winners further up the list declined the offer of admission.
The other columns of Table 4 show that the relevant counterfactual for lottery winners is
a traditional public school. Winning an NHA lottery decreases the likelihood of attending a
traditional public school by 16 percentage points. By contrast, winning a lottery decreased the
likelihood of attending a non-NHA charter by only half a percentage point, and of attending an
NHA school outside the student’s risk set by 1.6 percentage points.
It is possible that these initial differences in enrollment grow or shrink over time. To
examine this, Figure 3 plots reduced form estimates of the difference between lottery winners
and losers in the cumulative years enrolled in a risk-set school, estimated separately each year
after the lottery. Figure 3 also presents the treatment-control difference in the share of years a
student enrolled out of all the years she could potentially have done so. The coefficients in
Figure 3 are estimated controlling for student characteristics and risk-set fixed effects as in
equation (1.1). While the difference in cumulative enrollment grows over time, the fraction of
potential years remains constant or even falls slightly.

25

Main Outcome Estimates
Table 5 shows estimates of the relationship between attending an NHA charter school
and student test scores. These estimates are based on a student-year panel that includes data on
post-lottery test scores in grades three through eight. The 2SLS estimates reflect the impact of
attending a charter school for one additional year. In Appendix Table 2, we confirm that
receiving an initial offer is not associated with the likelihood of enrolling in Michigan public
schools, on-time grade progression or having a standardized test score.
Consistent with prior lottery-based charter studies, we find that an additional year spent at
an NHA charter is causally associated with positive test score gains in math, with smaller effects
on reading scores that are not significant at conventional levels. The yearly gain in math is
estimated at 0.04 standard deviations, and is significant at the ten percent level. In addition, there
is a 1.4 percentage point increase in the likelihood of scoring above the proficiency cutoff. When
scaled by the nine years a student could potentially spend at an NHA charter (given that it serves
grades K-8), it suggests a maximum potential increase of 0.36 standard deviations in math
scores.
We have also examined non-score outcomes, including the attendance rate, classification
as a special-education student, and on-time grade progression. Effects for all of these outcomes
were small and statistically insignificant. Results available upon request.

Heterogeneity in Effects
We explore heterogeneity of effects along several dimensions. To begin, we examine
whether the effects vary by grade level. The impact of attending a charter school may differ

26

across grade levels for various reasons, including (i) a nonlinear effect of years attended (e.g. one
year attended is important but three years makes no additional difference), (ii) a change in the
quality of the counterfactual (e.g., if traditional public middle schools are particularly weak), or
(iii) differences in the nature of the material covered and school expertise (e.g., charter schools
may be particularly good at teaching early, basic skills, in which case the impacts in early grades
may be larger than impacts in later grades).
Figures 5a and 5b show the 2SLS estimates of math and reading scores separately by
grade. The estimates are noisy, and exhibit an odd saw tooth pattern. Because the later lottery
cohorts have not yet reached the older grades, it is possible that the patterns we see here are due
in part to compositional changes and heterogeneity in effects by cohort. Figures 5a and 5b show
the patterns for cohorts we can observe through grade eight. Here we see some evidence that the
point estimates appear somewhat larger for students in the middle school grades, although the
estimates are not precise enough that they are significantly different by grade.
We next examine how these effects differ by student demographics. Table 6 reports
estimates of the impact of an additional year spent at an NHA school for different student
characteristics. Several interesting patterns emerge. First, female students benefit more than male
students (0.059 versus 0.010). Second, in contrast to prior research on charter schools,
economically disadvantaged students do not appear to benefit as much as other students. For
example, the reduced form estimate for non-poor students is 0.045 compared with -0.012 for
poor students. Similarly, the 0.034 reduced form effect for White/Asian students is larger than
the 0.015 estimate for Black/Hispanic students. 17
Interestingly, these subgroup differences appear to be driven in part by differences in
dosage. Economically disadvantaged students who won the lottery accumulated just 0.396 more
17

Patterns are similar, though less pronounced, for reading scores. Results available upon request.

27

years in an over-subscribed NHA school than those who lost the lottery (Column 4 first stage).
For applicants who are not economically disadvantaged, the first stage is almost three times
larger: 0.942 years. There is a similar, but less pronounced, pattern by race/ethnicity: the first
stage for Whites/Asians is 0.851 additional years, while for Black/Hispanics it is 0.622. Indeed,
our first-stage estimates are particularly low for applicants to NHA schools in urban areas.
If we focus on students who were applying to NHA schools in an urban area, we see that
winning the admissions lottery is associated a mere 0.26 additional years of enrollment in an
NHA school. While the urban sample size is too small to split further, we can split the non-urban
sample into economically disadvantaged and less disadvantaged students within (columns (10)
and (11) of Table 6). The same pattern holds, and is even more pronounced, with non-poor
students benefitting more from enrollment in an NHA, and exhibiting a dosage almost three
times the size of poor students.
We conducted several supplementary analyses to better understand the pattern of firststage estimates. To determine whether the differential first stages shown in Table 6 result from
differences in immediate enrollment versus subsequent mobility, we estimated the first-stage
effect by year since lottery separately for each subgroup. We find that the differential effects are
driven by the fact that disadvantaged students who win a lottery are substantially less likely to
enroll in the NHA school next Fall when compared to more advantaged peers. For example, the
first stage effect on enrollment next Fall is 22 percentage points for non-poor students, and only
13 percentage points for poor students. Similarly, the first stages for non-urban and urban
students are 23 percentage points and 8.6 percentage points respectively (more detailed results
are available upon request.)

28

One reason the first-stage could be lower for poor and urban students is that they face a
relatively higher cost of commuting to an NHA school. To examine this, for each student we
calculate the distance from his or her census block centroid to the nearest NHA school in the
student’s choice set, as well as the distance to the nearest other public school the student could
have attended (based on district boundaries and grade level). We then calculate the difference
between these distances – i.e., how much further would the student have to travel to attend the
nearest NHA option in his or her risk set compared with the closest public school.
The average (s.d.) for poor children is -3.6 miles (7.74) compared with -3.2 (6.15) for
non-poor children. For poor students, the nearest NHA school is on average 3.6 miles further
than the nearest TPS, while it is 3.2 miles further than the nearest TPS for non-poor students. The
urban and non-urban mean and standard deviations are -3.0 (6.3) and -3.5 (6.8), respectively.
Theoretically, both the differential in relative distance to an NHA, and the fact that charter
schools are not required to provide transportation for students, could create differential costs for
poor students.
To examine this further, we include the interaction between winning an offer and student
subgroup (e.g. poor or urban) in the first-stage regression. The regression also includes the
differential distance measure, the two-way interactions between the distance measure and
winning a lottery, and the distance measure and the student subgroup, and the triple interaction
of the subgroup, offer, and distance measure, allowing the “cost” of distance to vary for poor vs.
non-poor (or urban vs. non-urban) students separately. The regression shows no differential
effect of the distance measure on poor or urban student take-up rates, 18 and does not explain the

18

The coefficient is a precisely estimated zero for the triple interaction of subgroup, any initial offer, and the
distance differential. The coefficient on the double interaction of any initial offer and the distance differential is a
statistically significant 0.4 percentage points; for each mile closer that the closest NHA gets relative to the closest
TPS, take-up increases by 0.4 points for all students. Results available upon request.

29

initial take-up gaps, though the difference in distance between NHA and TPS schools is strongly
associated with enrollment in the NHA in general.
We conduct a similar exercise using the number of different schooling options available
within a two, three and five-mile radius of a child’s home census block. Once again, while the
number of alternative options is negatively associated with NHA enrollment, it does not explain
the differential take-up across demographic groups.
For the purpose of understanding the impact of attending the benefit of actually attending
an NHA school, the differences in dosage do not change the patterns seen in the reduced form –
namely, less disadvantaged students appear to benefit more from NHA. It does, however,
provide information on the compliers who are identifying our IV estimate. Specifically, the
pattern of results shown in Table 6 suggests that our average 2SLS estimate of .04 standard
deviations is driven by students who are less economically disadvantaged, more likely to be
white and/or Asian and more likely to be attending an NHA school in a non-urban area.

Effects on School Inputs
The results above suggest that attending an NHA school increases standardized math test
scores, particularly in the middle school grades. In order to explore potential mechanisms, we
estimate the models described above where the outcomes are characteristics of the schools
actually attended by lottery applicants in years following the lottery (rather than the student’s
own standardized test scores). As above, Table 7 presents the reduced form estimates which
capture the impact of receiving an initial offer as well as the 2SLS estimates which reflect the
impact of attending an NHA school for an additional year. The results in this table tell us how

30

NHA schools differ from the counterfactual school a student would have attended had she or he
not received an offer from an NHA school.
A few differences stand out. First, attending an NHA school increases the likelihood of
the student attending a K-8 school by 15 percentage points on average over all years in the panel
(relative to baseline of 49 percent), and reduces the number of students per grade in the school by
8 (relative to baseline of 127).
Second, attending an NHA school changes the composition of peers a student faces.
Students who are induced to attend an NHA school through winning an admissions lottery end
up attending schools with two percentage points (five percent) fewer poor children, 0.8
percentage points (seven percent) fewer special education students, and peers who score 0.08
standard deviations higher on state math exams.
Third, attending an NHA school exposes students to a notably different set of teachers.
Teachers in NHA schools have less experience and are more likely to turnover than teachers in
schools that students would have attended otherwise. Attending an NHA school is associated
with a 4.8 percentage point increase in the share of novice teachers, and reduces median teacher
experience by a year relative to a baseline of 6.4 years. Further, receiving an offer to an NHA
school exposes students to teachers who are slightly less likely to have attended competitive
colleges. However, it also exposes students to teachers who, on average, score 0.05 standard
deviations higher on the teacher certification exam.
In an effort to explore school policies and practices, we administered a survey to all
general education charter schools in Michigan that were open during the 2012-13 and 2013-14
school years as well as the traditional public schools that each charter school’s students would

31

most likely have attended based on their neighborhood. 19 School leaders responded at very high
rates, with 85% of charter school leaders and 76% of traditional public school leaders
participating in the survey. A total of 435 schools, including 226 charter and 209 traditional
public schools are represented in the study. We created 20 measures of school practices within 5
domains – instruction, school culture, organization and leadership, teacher compensation, and
time – each of which is described in detail in Appendix Table 3.
Because we did not survey all nearby traditional public schools, students in our sample
who won a lottery to an NHA school were substantially more likely to attend a school that had
completed a survey. For this reason, we cannot replicate the analysis from Table 7 with our
survey measures. However, we can compare school practices at the NHA schools to nearby
traditional public schools that many, though not all, lottery losers attended. To do so, we regress
each survey measure on binary indicators for NHA charter school and other charter schools as
well as match group fixed effects, which serve to ensure that each charter school is being
compared to the set of traditional public schools nearby. Results are reported in Table 8.
Several findings stand out. First, there are notable differences in school culture and
organization. NHA schools score a full standard deviation higher on the “No Excuses” measure
used in Dobbie & Fryer (2013). They also score 0.75 standard deviations higher on a measure of
parent engagement.
There are also some potentially important differences in instructional practices –
including the use of time – between NHA and other schools. While there is no difference in total

19

Because a given charter school can draw students from a number of different traditional public schools,
we assign each charter school a counterfactual public school based on the modal school students would
likely otherwise attend. In cases where charter schools span more than one school level (e.g., a K-8
charter school), we assign each grade span (e.g. K-5 and 6-8) its own traditional public school. See online
appendix at http://edpolicy.umich.edu/publications/#policy-briefs for further explanation.
32

instructional hours per year, NHA schools devote 0.23 more hours per week to math instruction
than comparison traditional public schools. NHA schools are substantially more likely to use
ability grouping in core academic subjects. Indeed, virtually all NHA schools report grouping
students by ability for math instruction and 80 percent doing so for reading instruction. In
contrast, only half of traditional public schools report doing so for either subject. NHA schools
report administering diagnostic or benchmark assessments more frequently than other schools – a
difference of 0.7 standard deviations on our measure of overall test frequency. 20 On the other
hand, we found no significant differences in the nature or amount of tutoring provided in NHA
schools, or the uniformity of instruction.
Third, we see some differences in the domain of school organization and leadership.
NHA schools are 47 percentage points (150 percent) more likely to report that administrators act
as mentors to teachers. NHA principals report observing teachers roughly 9 hours per year
compared with principals in traditional public schools who report doing so only 2 hours per year.
The high reported rates of administrative mentorship could be related to an organizational feature
of the NHA. NHA schools employ three instructional deans in addition to a principal. The deans
are primarily responsible for mentoring teachers in instructional practices and generally spend an
hour a week observing them.
Administrators in NHA schools report having substantially more control over hiring
decisions than administrators in other schools, and are substantially less likely to report that “bad
teachers” are an important problem in their school.
The starting teacher salaries at NHA schools is roughly $1,500 less than the $37,400
reported by comparison traditional public schools, but about $2,400 higher than starting salaries

20

Because charters are required to take the same state exams as all public schools, the difference stems from the use
of diagnostic or benchmark exams.

33

in other charter schools. However, teachers at NHA charters are much more likely to be eligible
for performance bonuses compared with teachers in traditional public schools or other charters. 21
Only 20 percent of comparison schools report having performance bonuses while all NHA
schools report such bonuses. Conditional on the existence of bonuses, there is not a significant
difference in the amount of the bonus, but the estimates are very noisy.

VII.

Discussion and Conclusion
To the extent that there is consensus in the charter literature to date, it seems to be that

while charter school impacts vary considerably, they tend to be most effective in urban settings
for poor and minority students. The most effective schools identified to date have been nonprofits, and the most rigorous, non-experimental evidence suggests that, on average, for-profit
charters are less effective than the traditional public schools students would have attended in the
absence of the charter.
The current study of NHA schools in Michigan presents a counterpoint to these
consensus views, examining schools with a different management structure that tend to locate on
the fringes of urban centers more often than within them, and which are effective among an
entirely different population of students. Our estimates indicate that attending a NHA charter
school for one additional year is associated with a 0.04 standard deviation increase in math
achievement, not as large as the marquee results from the high-profile Harlem Children's Zone
and Boston charters, but economically meaningful nonetheless. 22
Our analysis reveals another interesting finding. In contrast to most of the prior lotterybased charter impact literature which has consistently found that low-income, underrepresented
21

The NHA reports that this practice is less prevalent in recent years relative to the survey year.
These estimates are consistent with the most recent non-experimental estimates of NHA reported by CREDO
(2017).
22

34

minorities in urban areas benefit most from attending the lottery schools, the largest impacts of
attending the NHA charter network are concentrated among non-poor students attending charter
schools outside urban areas. These findings further highlight the importance of exploring the full
range of possibilities in the large, diverse charter school sector.
Of course, the present analysis only examines a single charter school network, and thus
cannot speak to the effectiveness of all for-profit charter schools in Michigan. In ongoing nonexperimental work, we are examining the population of charter schools in Michigan, allowing us
to explore factors associated with charter effectiveness, including for-profit status and network
membership. However, by leveraging rich survey data, the present study sheds some light on
potential mechanisms through which schools may influence student achievement.
Despite its different management structure and student population, NHA shares many of
the policies and practices of previously studied successful charter schools. NHA schools provide
extra time for core academic subjects, utilize ability grouping and frequent benchmark
assessment, employ relatively young teachers, maintain a “No Excuses” culture, and have
principals actively engaged in observing and mentoring teachers. These findings provide further
support for the set of policies associated with successful schools in other work (Abdulkadiroǧlu
et al. 2011, Angrist et al. 2013, Dobbie and Fryer 2013, and Fryer 2014).
As powerful forces in domestic policy move to increase the prevalence of school choice
mechanisms, including charter schools, it is more important than ever to understand the settings
that are most conducive to their success.

Notes: Sample in columns (1) through (5) is taken from all schools in the MSDS student/year-level file for the 2011-12 academic year, merged to
charter designations from the EEM/CCD school-level file and to state standardized assessment data. Sample in column (7) is all applicants to
NHA lotteries between 2003 and 2012, observed in the 2011-2012 school year, with all sample restrictions detailed in Appendix Table 1.
Elementary schools begin in kindergarten or 1st grade and end in grade 5 or 6; middle schools begin in grade 6 or 7 and end in grade 8 or 9.
Statistics in columns (1) through (6) are weighted by the number of students enrolled in each school (except for the total number of schools, the
total number of students, and the median enrollment per grade). Column (7) is weighted by the number of applications in the lottery analysis
sample.

Notes: This table reports means and treatment-control differences in pre-lottery characteristics for students who
applied to a NHA lottery between 2003 and 2012, subject to all restrictions in Appendix Table 1. Columns (1)
through (4) report on pre-lottery characteristics available for all students, while the remaining columns report on
characteristics for students who were enrolled in MI public schools prior to the lottery. The sample includes one
observation per student, lottery grade, and lottery year grouping. Columns (4) and (8) report the coefficients on
receiving an initial offer in a regression controlling for risk set fixed effects, with standard errors clustered by
the risk set reported in parentheses. "Median Household Income, Thousands" is in 2015 U.S. dollars, defined at
the block-group level, and taken from the 2010 Census.

Notes: This table reports estimates of the effect of receiving an initial offer on the day of
the lottery on whether the student enrolled in various types of schools during the
following fall. The sample includes all students in NHA risk sets between 2003 and 2012,
subject to the restrictions in Appendix Table 1. There is one observation per student, riskset, and lottery year grouping. Standard errors are reported in parentheses, clustered by
the risk set. All models control for demographic variables including the full interaction of
female, ethnicity, and poverty status, as well as census block-group characteristics,
missing indicators for covariates, and pre-lottery test scores, special education status,
limited English proficiency status, and poverty status if available.

Notes: This table reports reduced form and 2SLS estimates of the effect of each additional year spent in an
NHA charter school. The instrument is an indicator for receiving an initial offer on the day of the lottery
for at least one school in a student’s risk-set. The sample includes all students in NHA risk sets between
2003 and 2012, subject to the restrictions in Appendix Table 1. There is one observation per student, riskset, year grouping. The full panel includes all observations through a student's expected 8th-grade year.
Column (1) reports the effect of an initial offer on the cumulative years spent in any risk-set school (the
first stage). All standard errors are reported in parentheses, clustered by the risk set. Column (5) reports
control complier means in curly braces. All models control for demographic variables including the full
interaction of female, ethnicity, and poverty status, as well as census block-group characteristics, tested
grade fixed effects, missing indicators for covariates, and pre-lottery test scores, special education status,
limited English proficiency status, and poverty status if available.

Notes: The sample includes all students who entered kindergarten-8th grade lotteries, subject to the
restrictions in Appendix Table 1. There is one observation per student, risk-set, tested year grouping.
The full panel includes all observations through a student's expected 8th-grade year observed through
2016. All models control for demographic variables including the full interaction of female, ethnicity,
and poverty status, as well as census block-group characteristics, tested grade fixed effects, missing
indicators for covariates, and pre-lottery test scores, special education status, limited English proficiency
status, and poverty status if available. Coefficients on any initial offer (Reduced Form), followed by
standard errors clustered by risk set in parentheses. Control Mean is mean of outcome variable among
students with no initial offers; CCM stands for Control Complier Mean. The endogenous variable in the
2SLS regressions is the cumulative years spent at a school in the student’s risk-set. The instrument is
whether a student received any initial offer to a school in her risk-set.

Description
This is a scale ranging from 0 to 4 that measures the frequency of both internal and
external type assessments. It was created by taking the mean value of Q41a (internally
developed assessment), Q41b (externally purchased assessment), Q41c (norm-referenced
assessment), Q41d (criterion reference assessment), with the values of 0 = Never; 1 = per
semester; 2 = quarterly; 3 = monthly; and 4 = weekly.
The average salary at each school for a first year teacher without a master's degree.

Variable
testfreq

Binary indicator for whether teachers are eligible for a performance-based bonus

bonus

Performance-based bonus pay. This is set to 0 (in regressions only) if respondent's
answered no that teachers are not eligible for a performance-based bonus.
if classroom instruction is standardized or customized by teacher. This was created from
questions 11 (are teachers expected to adhere to scripted lessons) and 12 (does your school
provide common templates). If either one was selected as yes, then the composite is set to
1. If both are not selected, then the composite is set to 0.

bonus_amount

The average of questions 64a (how many minutes per year do principals observe new
teachers?) and 64b (how many minutes per year do principals observe experienced
teachers?).
Students are assigned to math classes based on ability.

principal_observe

Students are assigned to reading classes based on ability.

trackr

The school offers tutoring outside classroom hours.
Students are assigned to mandatory tutoring based on low performance.
The variable indicates hours of tutoring per month, which is the product of Q36 (how often
tutoring sessions are) and Q37 (how long tutoring sessions are). The coding for question 36
was converted from daily, weekly, or monthly to numeric values for days/week (assuming
a 5 day week): daily = 20; weekly = 4; monthly =1; and "other" that indicated 2-4
times/week = 12. Question 37 was coded with the midpoint for each range so that 1-30
minutes = 15; 31-60 = 45; 61-90 = 75; and over 90 minutes = 90.

A composite that ranges from 0-10. It is the sum of the 10 binary variables for the no
excuses questions: 1) school-wide policies enforced the same way; 2) new student
orientation to learn school policies; 3) teacher dismisses class, not bell; 4) teacher
addresses student problems immediately; 5) student does other work if task completed
early; 6) students sit up & track teacher with eyes; 7) only necessary items on student desk;
8) silence in hallways during transition time; 9) students silently working on activity at
start of class; and 10) all backpacks consistently stored in one place. Standardized into zscore form for regressions in columns M and N.
A scale ranging from 0 to 3. This is the sum of three binary variables for school behavioral
questions: 1) students required to wear school uniforms; 2) students required to sign
behavior contract; and 3) parents required to sign contract. Standardized into z-score form
for regressions in columns M and N.
The average fraction of parents involved across the following 5 school activities: 1) open
house; 2) parent-teacher conference; 3) volunteer at school; 4) PTA; and 5) homework

Curriculum control
difference

This variable is created from two variables, int_cur and ext_cur, which are each composed
of questions asking about curriculum decisions based on the balance of power between
internal actors (principals, teachers, and non-instructional staff) and external actors
(management company, authorizer, district/central office, superintendent, school board,
and consultants). Int_cur int_cur is based on questions 13a, 13b, and 13g (how much
influence do principals, teachers, and staff have on curriculum development?); ext_cur is
based on questions 13c, 13d, 13e, and 13g (how much influence do management
companies, authorizers, school district, school board, and other outside groups have on
curriculum development?). 13g is a free response question in which respondents can list
the groups that are relevant; staff, school board, and other outside groups are common
responses. For each of these two variables, a school is coded as 0 for no influence, 1 for
minor influence, 2 for moderate influence, or 3 for high influence for the respective group.
The difference is then taken between int_curr and ext_curr and the variable is standardized.

composed of questions asking about hiring decisions based on the balance of power

actors (management company, authorizer, district/central office, superintendent, school
board, and consultants). int_hire and ext_hire are based on questions 52a and 52b (who
performs initial screening of teachers, and who makes final hiring decisions?); int_hire
includes principals only, while ext_hire includes district offices, superintendents, and
school boards for traditional public schools and management companies and school boards
for charters. For each of these two variables, a school is coded as 9 for having no part of
either initial or final teacher hiring, 1 for part of either initial or final teacher hiring, or 2 for
having part of both initial and final teacher hiring for the respective group. The difference
is then taken between int_hire and ext_hire and the variable is standardized.

Appendix A – Collection of Lottery Data

We solicited lottery data from all existing and eligible charter schools in Michigan from May
2011 to June 2012 and attended a subset of school lotteries in spring 2012 and 2013. Out of the 252
eligible 23 charter schools we contacted, we obtained usable lottery records from 67 schools (27%) (See
Table A1). We collected lottery data from as many years as available in each school.

education focused (not alternative schools).
** Schools where the principal or school staff recalled conducting a
lottery
*** Schools with usable lottery records as determined by project team.

Since no central body collects lottery data from all schools, we had to reach out to each school to
learn its lottery history and gain access to its records. Schools fell into one of three categories: 1) they
had no memory of a prior lottery; 2) they could recall a prior lottery but did not save sufficient records; 3)
they had a prior lottery and saved sufficient records.
Rather than cold-calling charter schools, we reached out to the charter school authorizers (through
the Michigan Council of Charter School Authorizers) and larger management companies to get their buy-

23

We did not include alternative schools, i.e., strict discipline academies, vocational academies, and second-chance
schools.

in and assistance with contacting their schools. We then contacted school principals, explained the study,
asked about their lottery history, and in most cases, worked with the staff to locate, sift through, and
understand their lottery records. This entailed many in-person visits, emails, and phone calls to ensure we
had complete records with proper documentation. When we could, we attended the actual lotteries of
schools in our sample often as a way to fill in any gaps unintentionally left by school staff.
Over the course of our year-long fieldwork, we took note of the significant role the open
enrollment period appeared to play in whether a school had a lottery or not. The open enrollment period
is the only time a lottery can be legally triggered. Each school sets its own period with the only
requirement that it be at least two weeks. During this period, if more students apply than open seats for a
grade, then legally a lottery must occur. If there are enough open seats for all the students that apply, then
all the students are accepted without needing a lottery. The timing of a school’s open enrollment period
could directly impact the likelihood of a lottery. For example, schools that had an earlier open enrollment
period for only two weeks could usually accept all the eager and savvy applicants that applied and keep a
first-come first-serve waitlist after the open enrollment period. Schools that had a longer and later open
enrollment period (when parents were more likely to be thinking about the next school year) were more
likely to need a lottery, since more students could apply during this time. And with a lottery came the
inability to just accept all the students, presumably with the savviest parents, who applied first. And since
each school set its own open enrollment period, parents had to be exceptionally organized if applying to
multiple schools with multiple deadlines. We also noticed schools getting into open enrollment bidding
wars, setting their open enrollment periods to be earlier than competing schools so as to not miss out on
prime students.

Cleaning Lottery Data
Since each school managed their own lottery, there was little uniformity in lottery records across
schools and sometimes even within schools due to personnel changes. Due to this variation, we
developed a custom intake process by lottery record to standardize the format and information.
1

Fortunately, there was one large management company, National Heritage Academies (NHA), which
maintained physical and electronic records of lotteries from all of their schools. We applied the same
intake rules to these records.

Lottery Records from the NHA Network
We received lottery records from the NHA in two formats: (1) an excel spreadsheet with
information from its centralized enrollment database; and (2) physical lottery boards collected from its
network of schools.
The excel spreadsheet (or “electronic files”), contained first name, last name, date of birth, full
address, gender, school name, academic year, and grade for all applicants that participated in a lottery
from 2004-2012. They also contained the date admission was offered and the date a student was added to
the waitlist, which identified which students were admitted from the lottery, which were placed on the
waitlist and which, if any, of these waitlist students were later admitted. We did not know the waitlist
order, since the randomly drawn lottery number was not saved. We received a separate sibling file where,
for the most part, we could identify if an applicant had an applying or currently enrolled sibling.
The physical lottery board files showed the order the applicant was drawn and whether they had
“won” an open seat or were placed on the waitlist. Since these were records from the day of the lottery,
we could not tell which waitlist students were later admitted. The lottery board also contained student and
sibling information but was missing student date of birth.
The ideal combination was both the electronic and lottery board file for each lottery, since the
electronic file contained admission data and student date of birth, while the lottery board file contained
the waitlist order. We combined the information from both sources when available, but in some cases, we
only had one. Prior to 2004, only physical lottery boards were available, since electronic records did not
go back that far. And for some schools, we only had electronic lottery files, since it was up to the school
whether to save the physical lottery boards (not required by the NHA).

Appendix B – Construction of Lottery Instruments
In any lottery study, there are several options for constructing a lottery instrument. The initial
offer instrument is an indicator variable equal to one if a student is offered a seat in at least one school in
her risk set at the time of the lottery. The ever offer instrument is equal to one if initial offer is one, but
also counts offers made later, that is, offers extended to students on the waiting list after a student with an
initial offer decides to turn it down. If offers are given in the ordering established on the day of the lottery,
both initial offer and ever offer should be unrelated to most other characteristics of the student and predict
enrollment.
As explained in Appendix A, lottery information comes from two sources: pictures of lottery
boards (LBs) and electronic files (EFs). LB records contain lottery numbers and offers made on the day of
the lottery. EFs contain all offers (both initial and ever), but no lottery numbers. Thus, although ever offer
and initial offer can both be constructed from the EFs, verifying that a school complied with the lottery
ordering can only be achieved by cross- referencing the EF with the LB. In the full sample, 66% of lottery
applications with EFs have LB information. After sample restrictions, 58% of the EFs have corresponding
LB information.

Initial Offer
When both EFs and LBs are available, initial offers correspond about 98% of the time, according
to Table B1 below. LB records supersede EF records when both are available. Skipped lottery numbers
and repeat lottery numbers within the same lottery are also rare at 6.2% and 1.8% of all lottery applicants
with LBs, respectively. Thus, initial offer plausibly captures the random ordering established by the
lottery.

Notes: Comparison of recorded offers awarded on the day of the
lottery according to two sources of information: lottery boards and
electronic files. Comparison data only available for a subsample of
schools that saved lottery boards.

However, initial offer is less predictive of enrollment than ever offer. Some students do not
accept offers of admission, particularly in later grades where students must switch schools to take up an
offer.

Ever Offer
We check whether there exists any student who never received an offer and has a smaller lottery
number than somebody who did receive an offer in the same lottery. That is, we check for offers given
out of order. About 13% of all offers where both EF and LB records are available are out of order. Within
a lottery, the average fraction of offers that is out of order is 0.16, and the median fraction of out-of-order
offers is 0.11. Only 40 lotteries give more than 20% of their offers out of order, and 30 of these lotteries
extend fewer than 30 offers (in this case even one out-of-order offer is a large share of the total offers). In
addition, while some lotteries seem to be worse than others, averaged across all observed lotteries, only
two schools with more than 30 applications give 20% or more offers out of order.
This suggests that many lotteries and schools are doing a good job of following the lottery
number ordering, but for half of the sample, which schools and lotteries are doing a good job is
unobservable. It’s even possible that the sample for which we observe both LB and EF records has a
1

lower than average rate of out-of-order offers. Because some lotteries and schools are likely to be giving
non-random offers of admission, and it is impossible to observe this, the ever offer instrument is not
preferred.

Alternate Ever Offer Instruments
For the subset of lottery applications where both LB and EF records, two alternative instruments
can be constructed to attempt to “fix” any out of order offers. The adjustment depends on the type of error
assumed. If schools are failing to record offers (as opposed to failing to give offers in order), the adjusted
instrument should fill in offers for applicants who were skipped. We call this a backfilled instrument. If
schools are failing to give offers in order, but never fail to record offers, then we can count the number of
offers recorded and assign them according to the lottery number. We call this the lottery number
instrument.
However, both of these alternative instruments exist for a strange subset of students since schools
idiosyncratically saved LB information when it was not necessary to do so. Table B2 describes observable
characteristics for the different samples available for each instrument. Students in the alternate samples
apply to more lotteries (see Table B2). The alternate samples are observably different. For example,
students are more likely to come from non-urban areas, more likely to apply in 2009 or later, and are
slightly less likely to apply to middle school grades. Finally, the alternate samples are less likely to be
made up of underrepresented minorities (particularly Black students) and more likely to contain Asian
students. Because of the limited sample size and the irregularity of the sample, neither of the alternate
ever offer instruments are preferred, though results for these are reported in Table B3.

Notes: Column (1) uses the full sample subject to the restrictions in Appendix Table 1. Samples differ
between columns due to the exclusion of degenerate lotteries and risk sets according to each instrument.
Column (2) reports on the ever offer sample, column (3) on the lottery number instrument, which counts the
number of ever offers and assigns them according to the lottery number, and column (4) reports on the
backfilled instrument, which assigns an offer to anyone with a lottery number smaller than the maximum
which received an "ever offer."

DREO Estimator
Table B3 reports estimates using the initial offer instrument, the ever offer instrument, and the
ever offer instrument weighted to account for the fact that the number of ever offers depends on the
number of takers, following Behaghel and Chaisemartin (2017). Behaghel and Chaisemartin (2017) show
that without this weighting, the ever offer instrument is inconsistent. The reweighted estimator is called
the doubly-reweighted ever offer (DREO) estimator. The initial offer and DREO estimators should both
be consistent, though the initial offer instrument yields less precise estimates. The two-stage least squares
𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷
regressions for the DREO estimator use weights 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
, which are constructed as follows:

𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 𝑅𝑅 = 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �1 −

𝑅𝑅
The first set of weights, 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
, down-weights each student with an offer in a way that is equivalent

𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷
, acts like a propensity score
to removing one taker from each risk set. The second set of weights, 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

weighting. Here 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 denote whether applicant i in risk set k received an offer and whether she

enrolled in a charter, respectively. In addition, K denotes the total number of risk sets, 𝑁𝑁𝑘𝑘 is the number of

applicants in risk set k, N is the total number of applicants, 𝐿𝐿𝑘𝑘 is the number of offers in risk set k, and L

is the total number of offers across all risk sets. Finally, 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘 represents the number of seats in each risk-set,

and is imputed from the number of offers that are taken up in the data.

Table B3, column (1) replicates the analysis in the paper. Columns (2) and (3) report results for
the sample where ever offer records are available, and columns (4) through (9) report results for the
alternate instruments. These show that the alternate instruments do not have much more predictive power
than the initial offer instrument, possibly suggesting that they are not more accurate than the recorded
offers. For example, the first stage in column (6) for the backfilled instrument is weaker than the first
4

stage in column (4) for the initial offer instrument. If one takes the recorded offers at face value, then
results for the ever offer and DREO estimators in column (3) line up fairly well with the initial offer
results in column (2); they are not statistically distinguishable, even though the ever offer estimates are
possibly biased. The treatment on the treated estimates using the DREO estimator are more precise than
those estimated with the initial offer, and larger than the results using ever offer.

Notes: Outcome is math standardized test score, endogenous regressor is cumulative years spent at a charter school in the student's risk set, and four
instruments are used: initial offer, ever offer, and two alternate ever offer instruments. Regressions cluster standard errors at the risk-set level, control for riskset fixed effects, and the standard vector of covariates. Column (1) uses the full analysis sample. Columns (2)-(3) drop lotteries and risk-sets that are
degenerate on the ever offer instrument. Columns (4)-(6) drop lotteries and risk-sets that are degenerate on the first alternative ever offer instrument, which
assigns an offer to anyone with a lottery number smaller than the maximum lottery number to have received an "ever offer." Columns (7)-(9) drop lotteries and
risk sets that are degenerate on the second alternative ever offer instrument, which counts the number of ever offers, and assigns them according to the lottery
number. DREO estimates reweight the estimates according to Behaghel and Chaisemartin (2017).

Appendix C – Matching Lottery Records to Michigan Department of Education Administrative
Data
The analysis uses lottery records matched to administrative records maintained by the Michigan
Department of Education. Matching occurred using a combination of exact and probabilistic matching
techniques. Probabilistic matching can account for minor misspellings, nicknames, date and month swaps
in date of birth, and other common errors. We could also place a higher weight on certain variables like
date of birth compared to others, like ethnicity. In cases where it was difficult to read an applicant’s name
or date of birth, we would create multiple entries with the possible variations. We reconciled these
duplicates after the matching process. Overall, we matched 96% of the 98,499 lottery application student
records. We did not match 4,150 applicants and had to drop these applicants since we could not obtain
their state administrative outcome data.

Probabilistic Matching
We used Link King software for the probabilistic matching. Note that this was only possible for
records with non-missing date of birth. 24 We then divided our date of birth records by twins and nontwins, since Link King was less precise with twins. We ran the records lacking date of birth and the
records marked as twins through exact matching in STATA.
Of the 87% of lottery applicants who had date of birth and were not a twin, we matched 97% of
these in Link King. At a minimum, we matched on the binding variables first name, last name and date of
birth, and whenever available, we included the non-binding variables zip code, gender, and ethnicity.
Link King outputted a match level of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 (no 5) to indicate match strength, with match
levels 1, 2, and 3 reflecting stronger matches; 4, 6, and 7 reflecting weaker matches; and no match level
for records with no match. We accepted all level 1, 2, and 3 matches (95%), manually reviewed level 4,
6, and 7 matches (2%), and accepted all no match level as unmatched (3%) If a lottery applicant matched

to multiple students at the same match level, we considered these students unmatched to avoid false
positives (less than 1%).
Of the 11% of lottery applicants that were missing date of birth, we matched 86% of these
applicants in STATA. We ran multiple rounds, matching on all available information for an applicant. For
example, if an applicant had first name, last name, gender, zip code, lottery year and grade, we ran a oneto-many merge using all these variables. If a student uniquely matched, we considered this a proper
match. If a student had multiple matches, we checked street address if available to identify the correct
match. If we still could not identify a unique match, we considered this student unmatched to avoid false
positives. We then did the same for students with one less variable, and so on, establishing five sequential
matching rounds:
1) Lottery year, grade, first name, last name, zip code, gender;
2) Lottery year, grade, first name, last name, zip code;
3) Lottery year, grade, first name, last name;
4) First name, last name, zip code;
5) First name, last name.
To prevent false positives in the later rounds, we used the lottery year and grade from the applicant lottery
record to estimate the applicant’s age. We then checked the date of birth from the matching state
administrative record to see if the date of birth lined up with the estimated age, within a plus or minus two
year range. For those that fell outside of this age range, we considered them false positives and classified
them as unmatched.
Of the 3% of records we identified as twins (same last name, same date of birth, different first name), we
matched 99% of these applicants in STATA. We followed the same process as above except with more
matching rounds:
1) Lottery year, grade, first name, last name, zip code, gender, date of birth;
2) Lottery year, grade, first name, last name, zip code; date of birth;
