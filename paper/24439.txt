Foreign Safe Asset Demand and the Dollar Exchange Rate
Zhengyang Jiang, Arvind Krishnamurthy, and Hanno Lustig
NBER Working Paper No. 24439
March 2018, Revised in September 2020
JEL No. G15
ABSTRACT
We develop a theory that links the U.S. dollar’s valuation in FX markets to the convenience yield
that foreign investors derive from holding U.S. safe assets. We show that this convenience yield
can be inferred from the Treasury basis: the yield gap between U.S. government and currencyhedged foreign government bonds. Consistent with the theory, a widening of the basis coincides
with an immediate appreciation and a subsequent depreciation of the dollar. Our results lend
empirical support to models which impute a special role to the U.S. as the world’s provider of
safe assets and the dollar, the world’s reserve currency.

In the post-war era, the U.S. has been the world’s most favored supplier
of safe assets. Investors forgo a sizeable return, the convenience yield, to own
these assets (see Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2012, for example).
Moreover, during episodes of global financial instability, there is a flight to the
safety of U.S. Treasury bonds as the convenience yield on Treasurys rises. At
the same time, the dollar appreciates in foreign currency markets. Our paper
develops a theory that explains these stylized facts. In our new convenience yield
theory of exchange rates, the dollar’s valuation reflects the current and future
convenience yields that foreign investors derive from the ownership of U.S. safe
assets. We find that the convenience yields earned by foreign investors on U.S.
Treasurys are large and account for a sizeable share of the variation in the dollar
exchange rate. On average, foreign investors earn an extra convenience yield of
2% on Treasury holdings; 90% of this yield is directly attributable to their dollar
denomination. Thus, our study sheds light on how the U.S.’ role as the world’s
safe asset supplier, analyzed by Gourinchas and Rey (2007b); Caballero et al.
(2008); Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2009); Maggiori (2017); He et al. (2019);
Gopinath and Stein (2018), has shaped the dynamics of the dollar exchange
rate.
Our paper explores the response of the dollar exchange rate when foreign
investors impute a higher convenience yield to U.S. safe assets, such as U.S.
Treasurys, than U.S. investors. In equilibrium, foreign investors should receive
a lower return in their own currencies on holding U.S. safe assets than U.S.
investors. To produce lower expected returns on U.S. safe assets in foreign
currency, the dollar has to appreciate today and, going forward, depreciate in
expectation to deliver a lower expected return to foreign investors. We derive
a novel expression for the dollar exchange rate as the expected value of all
future interest rate differences and convenience yields less the value of all future
currency risk premia, extending the work by Campbell and Clarida (1987);
Clarida and Gali (1994); Froot and Ramadorai (2005). Our theory predicts that
a country’s exchange rate will appreciate whenever foreign investors increase

3

their valuation of the current and future convenience properties of that country’s
safe assets.
To develop a measure of the unobserved convenience yield on U.S. safe assets derived by foreign investors, we focus on U.S. Treasury bonds as the safest
among the set of U.S. safe assets. U.S. Treasury bonds are known to offer liquidity and safety services to investors which results in lower equilibrium returns to
investors from holding such bonds (see Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen,
2012; Greenwood et al., 2015). In our model, the foreign convenience yield is
proportional to the Treasury basis, the difference in yields between the dollar
yield on short-term U.S. Treasury bonds and short-term foreign government
bonds, currency-hedged, into U.S. dollars. Even in the absence of frictions,
covered interest rate parity (henceforth CIP) cannot hold for Treasurys when
investors derive convenience yields from cash positions in these securities.
We measure this wedge using data on spot exchange rates, forward exchange
rates, and pairs of government bond yields in a panel of G10 countries that
starts in 1988. We supplement our analysis with a dataset for the U.S/U.K.
cross that begins in 1970.1 The U.S. Treasury basis is generally negative and
widens during global financial crises. These negative bases are pervasive even
before the 2007—2009 global financial crisis.
On average, foreigners earn at least an additional 2% convenience yield on
U.S. Treasurys according to our estimates. Around 90% of the extra convenience
yield is attributable to the dollar exposure rather than the safety/liquidity of
Treasurys. If safe and liquid U.S Treasurys were not issued in dollars, they
would carry a convenience yield of about 0.2% more than the average non-US
G10 government bond. Thus, investors particularly value safe and liquid payoffs
that are denominated in dollars. Our findings imply that dollar-Libor deposits
as well as other safe dollar-denominated assets are good substitutes for U.S.
Treasurys and also carry a convenience yield.
1 Results

for this dataset are reported in Section H of the Appendix and are broadly

consistent with the results reported in the main text.

Exchange rates seem only weakly correlated with the macro-economic and
financial variables that ought to drive exchange rate variation (see, e.g., Froot
and Rogoff, 1995; Frankel and Rose, 1995, on the exchange rate disconnect
puzzle). Our work helps to resolve the exchange rate disconnect puzzle. Using
simple univariate regressions, we show that innovations in the U.S. Treasury
basis account for 17% of the variation in the spot dollar exchange rate, with
the right sign: a decrease in the basis coincides with an appreciation of the
dollar. Moreover, a decrease in the basis today predicts a future depreciation of
the dollar at longer horizons. We find a much weaker relation between foreign
Treasury bases and the exchange rates of the corresponding currencies. For
example, a widening of the U.K. Treasury basis does not lead to a significant
appreciation of the pound against other currencies. Our result lends support to
the proposition that the U.S. and the U.S. dollar occupy a unique position in
the international monetary system.
Complete market models of exchange rates fall short when confronted with
the data. Real exchange rates do not co-vary with macroeconomic quantities
in the right way (see Backus and Smith, 1993; Kollmann, 1995). Real exchange
rates do not vary counter-cyclically, and real exchange rates are not volatile
enough when confronted with the evidence from asset prices (Brandt et al.,
2006). Convenience yields introduce a wedge into the foreign investors’ Euler
equation. Adopting a preference-free approach, Lustig and Verdelhan (2019)
demonstrate that incomplete markets models without these wedges cannot simultaneously address the U.I.P. violations, the exchange rate disconnect, i.e.
the countercyclical variation, and the exchange rate volatility puzzles, while Itskhoki and Mukhin (2017) show that models with such a wedge can address the
exchange rate disconnect puzzle. Our work identifies convenience yields as a
key wedge between the real exchange rates and the difference in the log pricing
kernels that can quantitatively help to resolve this disconnect.
In our VAR analysis, we find that a one standard deviation positive shock
to the convenience yield widens the annualized Treasury basis by 20 bps, and

5

results in a 3% appreciation in the dollar over the next 2 quarters. Subsequently,
there is a gradual reversal over the next two to three years as the high convenience yield leads to a negative excess return on owning the U.S. dollar. Using
our new convenience-yield valuation equation for the exchange rate, we implement a Campbell-Shiller-style decomposition of exchange rate innovations into
a cash flow component which tracks interest rate differences, a discount rate
component which tracks currency risk premia, and, finally, a convenience yield
component. The convenience yield channel is quantitatively important: under
our benchmark calibration in which around 90% of the Treasury’s convenience
yield is attributable to the dollar exposure, the convenience yield accounts for
between 16% and 28% of the variation in the quarterly exchange rate. In Froot
and Ramadorai (2005)’s decomposition, the convenience yield component would
have been absorbed by the discount rate component.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section II sets out the stylized facts regarding
the U.S. Treasury basis. Section III lays out the convenience yield theory of
exchange rates. Section IV takes the theory to data. Section V decomposes
the dollar exchange rate variation into a convenience yield, an interest rate and
a risk premium component. Section VI concludes. The figures and tables are
printed at the end of the paper. The proofs and the state space representation
are in the appendix. The separate online appendix provides further derivations
of the theory, additional empirical evidence, and details our data sources.

Related Literature

Our results lend empirical support to theories of the U.S. as the provider
of world safe assets. There is ample empirical evidence that non-U.S. borrowers tilt the denomination of their borrowings (loans, deposits, bonds) especially
towards the U.S. dollar (see Shin, 2012; Brauning and Ivashina, 2017; Bruno
and Shin, 2017, on bank borrowing, and corporate bond borrowing respectively). Moreover, foreign investors tilt their portfolio towards owning U.S.

6

dollar-denominated corporate bonds when they invest in bonds denominated
outside their home currencies (see Maggiori et al., 2020a). This quantity evidence does not identify whether demand or supply factors are the main drivers
of the dollar bias in credit markets . Our evidence from sovereign bond markets
supports a demand-based explanation. The Treasury dollar basis is typically
negative and reductions in the basis appreciate the dollar, suggesting that foreign investors’ special demand for dollar-denominated assets lowers their expected returns.
There is a separate literature on the special role of the U.S. dollar and U.S.
asset markets in the world economy. Gourinchas and Rey (2007a); Pierre-Olivier
et al. (2011); Maggiori (2017) focus on the “exorbitant privilege” of the U.S.
that drives low rates of return on U.S. dollar assets. In their analysis, the U.S.
provides insurance to the rest of the world, while Gopinath (2015) highlights
the dominant role of the dollar as an invoicing currency. Lustig et al. (2014)
present evidence that a global dollar factor drives currency returns around the
world. Our results underscore that there is something special about the dollar
but does not directly speak to the evidence of this literature.
Our empirical approach is directly related to four other recent papers. First,
Du et al. (2018a) also study the Treasury basis, but for a different purpose.
They note that the U.S. Treasury basis is negative for short-maturity bonds,
suggesting that short-maturity bonds carry a convenience yield. They delve into
the term-structure of the basis, noting that the basis for long-maturity bonds
has been positive recently. We use the basis to infer a convenience yield, but
our main interest is in showing that the basis has explanatory power for the
dollar exchange rate.2
Second, Valchev (2020) shows that the quantity of outstanding U.S. Treasury
bonds helps to explain the return on the dollar. Valchev (2020) builds an openeconomy model to relate the quantity of U.S. Treasury bonds to the convenience
2 An

abridged version of the theory in this paper as well as results similar to that presented

in Table 3 are published in Jiang et al. (2018).

yield on Treasury bonds and the failure of uncovered interest parity. We show
that the existence of a foreign convenience yield for U.S. Treasury bonds causes
both uncovered interest parity and covered interest parity to fail. Moreover,
we show that variation in the convenience yields as measured by the dollar
basis explains a sizeable portion of the variation in the dollar exchange rate. In
closely related work, Koijen and Yogo (2020) estimate a global demand system
for assets (short-term bonds, long term bonds and equities) in which exchange
rates help to clear assets markets. Downward sloping demand for sovereign
bonds is consistent with convenience yields. They find that latent demand
shocks play an important role in accounting for exchange rate variation.
Third, there is a recent literature that explores the failure of LIBOR covered
interest rate parity (see Ivashina et al., 2015; Du et al., 2018b). A common
conclusion from this literature is the LIBOR-based CIP fails in part because
of financial constraints faced by banks. Our results reinforce this conclusion,
and we add to it by showing that LIBOR CIP fails when there is both foreign
demand for dollar-LIBOR assets and financial constraints faced by banks in
supplying dollar-denominated LIBOR deposits. When these constraints bind,
the LIBOR basis reflects the foreign demand for dollar-denominated safe assets
and will help to explain movements in the dollar exchange rate. Our empirical
evidence is consistent with this LIBOR mechanism.
Finally, in work subsequent to ours, Engel and Wu (2018) analyze nondollar currency pairs, and report evidence that CIP violations in sovereign bond
markets for non-dollar pairs have significant explanatory power for bilateral
exchange rates. In our sample, we find this relation to be much weaker for other
currencies when we exclude the dollar from all bilateral pairs.

II.

The U.S. Treasury Basis: Stylized Facts

Our paper relates movements in the value of the dollar exchange rate to the
demand for dollar safe assets. The key metric for this demand for dollar safe

8

assets is the U.S. Treasury basis. This section defines the Treasury basis and
presents some stylized facts on the movement of the basis. The next sections
present theory to tie the basis to the demand for dollar safe assets.
We define the U.S. Treasury basis as the difference between the yield on a
cash position in U.S. Treasurys yt$ and the synthetic dollar yield constructed
from a cash position in a foreign government bond, which earns a yield yt∗ in
foreign currency, that is hedged back into dollars:

xTt reas ≡ yt$ + (ft1 − st ) − yt∗ .

(1)

Here st denotes the log of the nominal exchange rate in units of foreign currency per dollar and ft1 denotes the log of the forward exchange rate. xTt reas
measures the violation of CIP constructed from U.S. Treasury and foreign government bond yields. A negative U.S. Treasury basis means that the U.S. Treasurys are expensive relative to their foreign counterpart. We also construct the
) using LIBOR rates. There is a recent literature examLIBOR basis (xLIBOR
t
ining the failure of the LIBOR CIP condition (see Ivashina et al. (2015); Du
et al. (2018b)). Our Treasury basis measure is closely related to the LIBOR
CIP deviation. That deviation is constructed using LIBOR rates for home and
foreign countries while our basis measure is the same deviation but constructed
using government bond yields for home and foreign countries. We discuss the
relation between the Treasury basis and the LIBOR basis fully in Section B in
the Appendix.
We develop and use two datasets, a panel of countries that spans 1988-2017
and a longer single time series from 1970 to 2016 for the United States/United
Kingdom pair. The shorter panel is based on quarterly data from 10 developed economies. The countries are Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, New
Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United States, and United Kingdom.
The sample starts in 1988Q1 and ends in 2017Q2. However, the panel is unbalanced, with data for only a few countries at the start of the sample. In

9

order to ensure results from Treasury basis and results from Libor basis are
comparable, we only include the country/quarter observations if both Treasury
basis and Libor basis are available. Because New Zealand’s 12-month Treasury
yield is available from 1987 whereas its 12-month Libor rate is available from
1996, and Sweden’s 12-month Treasury yield is available from 1984 whereas its
12-month Libor rate is available from 1991, we leave out some observations in
which Treasury basis is available but Libor basis is not. We have confirmed our
main empirical results are robust in the sample that contains these additional
observations of Treasury basis. We also present results using the Treasury basis measurement for bonds with maturities greater than 1 year from Du et al.
(2018a). Their sample is shorter but includes longer maturity bonds.
Our data comprises the bilateral exchange rates with respect to the U.S.
dollar, 12-month bilateral forward foreign exchange contract prices, and 12month government bond yields and LIBOR rates in all 10 countries. We use
actual rather than fitted yields for government bonds whenever possible. The
Bloomberg yield data used by Du et al. (2018a) is from a fitted yield curve,
which can induce measurement errors. The main exception is the 2001:9—
2008:5 period when the U.S. stopped issuing 12-month bills. We convert the
daily data to quarterly frequencies using end-of-quarter observations on the same
day for bond yields, interest rates, forward rates and exchange rates. There are
some quarters for which all of the data are not available on the last day of the
quarter, in which case we find a date earlier in the quarter, but as close to the
end-of-quarter as possible, when all data are available. The Data Appendix in
the separate online appendix contains information about data sources.
We construct the Treasury and LIBOR basis using the 12-month yields and
forwards for each currency following (1). In each quarter, we construct the mean
basis across all the countries in the panel for that quarter. Because the panel is
unbalanced, we construct country-level changes in the basis first, and then take
the cross-country average to arrive at the change in the basis. We denote the
cross-sectional mean basis in the panel as xTt reas . Similarly, we use y ∗t − yt$ to

10

denote the cross-sectional average of yield differences, and st denotes the equally
weighted cross-sectional average of the log of bilateral exchange rates against
the dollar. For each of these cross-sectional averages, we employ the same set
of countries that are in the sample at time t.

U.S. LIBOR and Treasury basis in basis points from 1988Q1 to 2017Q2. The maturity is one
year. We plot the cross-sectional mean and median for each of the bases.

Figure 1 plots these series. The dotted line is the mean LIBOR basis of the
U.S. dollar against the basket of currencies. The pre-crisis spikes in the average
LIBOR basis are driven by idiosyncrasies of LIBOR rates in Sweden (currency
crisis) in 1992 and Japan in 1995 (note the difference between the mean and
median LIBOR basis in 1992 and 1995). The LIBOR basis is close to zero for
most of the sample and turns negative and volatile beginning in 2007. These
stylized facts about the LIBOR basis are known from the work of Du et al.
(2018b).
The solid line is the mean Treasury basis. Unlike the LIBOR basis, the
Treasury basis has always been negative and volatile. Table I reports the timeseries moments of the Treasury basis, the Libor basis, the 12M (12-month)
Treasury yield difference and the 12M forward discount. The average mean
Treasury basis is −22 bps per annum, which means that foreign investors are

11

willing to give up 22 bps per annum more for holding currency-hedged U.S.
Treasurys than their own bonds. The standard deviation of the mean Treasury
basis is 23 bps per quarter. In contrast, the average LIBOR basis is −6 bps.
Section A of the Appendix consider the U.S./U.K. Treasury basis over a longer
sample and finds similar dynamics.

When LIBOR CIP holds, the Treasury basis is simply the difference between
the U.S. Treasury-LIBOR spread and its foreign counterpart:

xTt reas = yt$ − yt$,Libor − yt∗ − yt∗,Libor .

(2)

Before the financial crisis, when the LIBOR basis was close to zero (−3 bps),
12

the Treasury basis (−22 bps) is mostly due to this differential in the TreasuryLIBOR spreads. The U.S. LIBOR-Treasury spread is 23 bps larger than its foreign counterpart. During and after the crisis, this U.S. LIBOR-Treasury spread
is only 7 bps per annum higher than the foreign one, while the average LIBOR
basis widens to −14 bps per annum. Over the entire sample, the Treasury and
LIBOR basis have a correlation of 0.40. This correlation is largely driven by
the post-crisis relation where the correlation 0.62. Finally, the Treasury basis
is negatively correlated with the U.S.-foreign Treasury yield difference and the
forward discount.
Table II. The Treasury Basis and Interest Rate Spreads
We regress the quarterly average Treasury basis, xT reas , on a number of U.S. money market
spreads and the U.S. to foreign government bond interest rate differential. The spreads and
interest rate differential are constructed as the quarterly average of the indicated series. Data
is from 1988Q1 to 2017Q2 for the regressions with 118 observations and 2001Q4 to 2017Q2
for the regressions with 63 observations. OLS standard errors in parentheses. One, two and

Table II provides some statistics on the covariates of the Treasury basis.
In the first column, we regress the basis on the OIS-T-bill spread which is a
measure of the liquidity premium on Treasury bonds. Note that the basis is
negative on average (see Figure 1). There is little relation between the basis
and OIS-Tbill. The second column instead uses the spread between LIBOR and
OIS. This spread is strongly negatively related to the basis and the R2 of the
regression is 62%. When the LIBOR-OIS spread rises, as in a flight-to-quality,
the basis goes more negative. Note that OIS data is only available since 2001.
Column (3) reports the correlation with the LIBOR-Tbill spread which we can

13

118
0.41

construct to the start of our sample in 1988. There is a strong negative relation
between the spread and the basis, and we learn from columns (1) and (2) that
the relation is likely due to the LIBOR-OIS component of this spread (note also
that the coefficient on LIBOR-OIS is quite similar to the coefficient on LIBORT-bill). Column (4) includes the spread between U.S. interest rates and the
mean foreign interest rate. When U.S. rates are high relative to foreign rates,
the basis is more negative. We have run specifications where we include both
U.S. and foreign interest rates, and subject to the caveat that these rates do
move together, the correlation seems to be driven by the U.S. interest rate and
not the foreign rate. Column (5) and (6) include both the LIBOR spread and
the U.S. to world interest rate differential. The explanatory power for the basis
is largely driven by the LIBOR spread. To see this, compare the R2 in columns
(5) and (6) to those in columns (3) and (4).
During episodes of global financial instability, there is a flight to the safety
of U.S. Treasury bonds which increases their convenience yield (see Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2012, for example). During these episodes, the
wedge between U.S. and foreign currency hedged Treasury yields rises. Figure
1 illustrates this pattern for the 2008 financial crisis. The dollar appreciates by
about 30% over this period. The hypothesis of this paper is that the increase in
the convenience yield on U.S. Treasury bonds assigned by foreign investors will
also be reflected in an appreciation of the U.S. dollar. The spot exchange rate of
a safe asset currency will reflect the cumulative value of all future convenience
yields.

III. A Theory of Spot Exchange Rates,
Forward Exchange Rates and Convenience
Yields on Bonds
This section develops a theory of spot and forward exchange rates and convenience yields. There are two countries, foreign (∗) and the U.S. ($), each
with its own currency. We use St to denote the nominal exchange rate in units
14

of foreign currency per dollar, so that an increase in St corresponds to an appreciation of the U.S. dollar. There are domestic (foreign) nominal default-free
government bonds denominated in dollars (in foreign currency). We derive bond
and exchange rate pricing conditions that are implied by no-arbitrage.
We focus on the pricing of government bonds as the assets that produce
convenience yields. As we will make clear, our theory is about the pricing
of all U.S. dollar-denominated safe assets, not just U.S. Treasury bonds, but
our empirical work is largely about the measured convenience yields on U.S.
Treasury bonds. As a result, the expressions we derive for U.S. Treasury bonds
will guide our empirical work.

A.

Convenience yields and exchange rates
We use yt∗ to denote the nominal yield on a one-period risk-free zero-coupon

bond in foreign currency. Likewise, yt$ denotes the nominal yield on a one-period
risk-free zero-coupon Treasury bond in dollars. The stochastic discount factor
(SDF) of the foreign investor is denoted Mt∗ , while that of the U.S. investor
is denoted Mt$ . We use λi,j
to denote the convenience yield of investors in
t
country j for bonds issued by the government in country i. Foreign investors
price foreign bonds denominated in foreign currency, and the foreign investor’s
Euler equation is given by:


∗,∗
∗
∗
Et Mt+1
eyt = e−λt ,

λ∗,∗

t

(3)

The expression on the left side of the equation is standard. On the right side, we
allow foreign investors to derive a convenience yield, λ∗,∗
t , on their domestic bond
holdings. λ∗,∗
is asset-specific and hence cannot be folded into the stochastic
t
discount factor. Our model abstracts away from the fact that the value of
Treasury bonds is ultimately derived from the government’s budget constraint.
Chernov et al. (2020); Jiang (2019a,b); Jiang et al. (2019); Liu et al. (2019)
study how the government budget affects currency returns and bond valuation.

Foreign investors can also invest in U.S. Treasurys. To do so, they convert
local currency to U.S. dollars to receive

1
St

dollars, invest in U.S. Treasurys, and

then convert the proceeds back to local currency at date t + 1 at St+1 . Foreign
investors in U.S. Treasurys derive a convenience yield, λ$,∗

bond holdings:

Suppose the convenience yield λ$,∗
rises, lowering the right side of equation
t
(4). Then, the required return on the investment in U.S. Treasury bonds (the
left side of the equation) falls; either the expected rate of dollar appreciation
declines or the yield yt$ declines, or both.
Next, we use these pricing conditions to derive an expression linking the
exchange rate and the convenience yield. We assume that m∗t = log Mt∗ and
∆st+1 = log

St+1
St

are conditionally normal. Then, the Euler equation for the

foreign bond in (3) can be rewritten as,


RPt∗ = −covt m∗t+1 , ∆st+1 is the risk premium the foreign investor requires
for the exchange rate risk when investing in U.S. bonds. We combine these two
expressions to find:

by a foreign investor is decreasing in the convenience yield gap:

∗,∗
Et [∆st+1 ] + yt$ − yt∗ + vart [∆st+1 ] = RPt∗ − (λ$,∗

The left hand side is the excess return earned by a foreign investor from investing
in the U.S. bond relative to the foreign bond. This is the return on the reverse
carry trade, given that U.S. yields are typically lower than foreign yields. On the
right hand side, the first term is the familiar currency risk premium demanded
by a foreign investor going long U.S. Treasurys in dollars. The second term is
the convenience yield attached by foreign investors to U.S. Treasurys minus the
convenience yield foreign investors derive from their holdings of their own bonds
(“convenience yield gap”). A positive convenience yield gap, λ$,∗
− λ∗,∗
> 0,
t
t
lowers the required return on the reverse carry trade, i.e., the return to investing
in U.S. Treasury bonds. Even in the absence of priced currency risk, RPt∗ = 0,
uncovered interest parity fails when the convenience yield gap is greater than
zero.

B.

U.S. demand for foreign bonds
Since U.S. investors have access to foreign bond markets, there is another

pair of Euler equations to consider. An increase in the foreign convenience yield
imputed to U.S. Treasurys implies an expected deprecation of the dollar. For
a U.S. investor, buying foreign bonds when the dollar is expected to depreciate
produces a high carry return. The U.S. investor’s Euler equation when investing
in the foreign bond is:

yields, holding the SDF fixed: yt$ = ρ$t − λ$,$

17

assume log-normality and rewrite these equations to derive an expression for
the carry trade return,


∗,$
yt∗ − yt$ − Et [∆st+1 ] + vart [∆st+1 ] = RPt$ + (λ$,$

(10)


where, RPt$ = −covt m$t+1 , −∆st+1 is the risk premium the U.S. investor
requires for the exchange rate risk when investing in foreign bonds (i.e. the risk
premium attached to the dollar appreciating).
Finally, we combine (7) and (10) to derive a cross-country restriction on the
convenience yields imputed to Treasurys and the currency risk premia,
∗,∗
$,$
∗,$
$
∗
(λ$,∗
t − λt ) − (λt − λt ) = rpt + rpt ,

(11)

where we use rp$t = RPt$ − 12 vart [∆st+1 ] and rp∗t = RPt∗ − 12 vart [∆st+1 ] to
denote the log currency risk premia.
LEMMA 2: Under the assumption that the log currency risk premia are symmetric, rp$t = −rp∗t , foreign and domestic investors agree on the relative convenience of Treasurys vs. foreign bonds:
∗,$
$,$
∗,∗
(λ$,∗
t − λt ) = (λt − λt ).

(12)

We will develop our model for this symmetric case because it easiest to
exposit. Under the symmetry assumption, the convenience yield gaps between
foreign and domestic bonds are the same for either foreign or U.S. investors,
and it is this gap that enters exchange rate determination. We can deviate from
symmetry in log currency risk premia and relax equation (12); however, this
comes at the cost of additional complexity that we do not think adds to the
analysis. We pursue this approach more systematically in related work (see,
e.g. Jiang et al., 2020a,b).

18

C.

Exchange rates, Interest Rates and Convenience yields
Next, we explore the implications of our theory for the level of the exchange

rate. By forward iteration on (7), the level of exchange rates can be stated
as a function of the interest rate differences, the currency risk premia and the
future convenience yields (see Froot and Ramadorai, 2005, for a version without
convenience yields). Campbell and Clarida (1987); Clarida and Gali (1994)
developed an early version of this decomposition that imposed U.I.P.
LEMMA 3: The level of the nominal exchange can be written as:

st =

∞
X

Et
(λ$,∗
t+τ
τ =0

− λ∗,∗
t+τ ) + Et

∞
X

$
(yt+τ
τ =0

∗
− yt+τ
) − Et

∞
X
τ =0

rp∗t+τ + Et [ lim st+T ].
T →∞

(13)
The term Et [limτ →∞ st+τ ] is constant only if the nominal exchange rate is
stationary.
The exchange rate level is determined by yield differences, the convenience
yields, and the currency risk premia. This is an extension of Froot and Ramadorai (2005)’s expression for the level of exchange rates. The first term involves
the sum of expected convenience yields λ$,∗
t+τ earned by foreign investors on their
holdings of U.S. Treasurys in excess of the convenience yields λ∗,∗
t+τ earned on
their own bonds. The second term involves the sum of bond yield differences.
Note that the convenience yield earned by U.S. investors on their holdings of
$
U.S. Treasurys lowers the U.S. Treasury yield yt+τ
and hence lowers the second

term. This expression implies that an increase in the expected future convenience yields earned by foreigners relative to those earned by U.S. investors
should cause the dollar to appreciate today.
To clarify this latter point regarding convenience yields of foreign investors
relative to U.S. investors, we rewrite (13) as the sum of the convenience yield differentials, the fundamental yield differences, stripped of the convenience yields,

19

and the risk premia:

st = Et

(14)
$
where ρ$t = − log Et Mt+1
= yt$ + λ$,$
is the fundamental (no convenience
t



effect) bond yield in dollars, and likewise for foreign. Expression (14) clarifies
that the exchange rate responds only to the difference in convenience yields
on U.S. Treasurys earned by foreigners and by domestic investors. When the
foreign investors’ convenience yields on Treasurys increases relative to the U.S.
convenience yields, then the dollar appreciates.
Thus far we have not derived a process for the exchange rate. We begin by
noting that when markets are complete, the unique exchange rate process that
is consistent with absence of arbitrage opportunities is,

∆st+1 = m$t+1 − m∗t+1 .

(15)

See for example Backus et al. (2001). When markets are incomplete, an exchange rate process that satisfies all of four of the Euler equations (two investors
in two bonds) is:

$,∗
∆st+1 = m$t+1 − m∗t+1 + ηt+1 + λ$,$
t − λt

(16)

where ηt+1 is an incomplete markets wedge that satisfies restrictions to enforce
the Euler equations for bond investors (Lustig and Verdelhan, 2019). This
expression also underscores that markets must be incomplete in our convenience
yield theory. If markets were complete, ηt+1 = 0 are zero in all states of the
$,∗
world and the convenience yield gap, λ$,$
t − λt , must be zero. We can derive

an expression for st by forward substitution (16), and after taking expectations,
we recover the expression in (13). Section B of the Appendix contains a detailed
derivation behind these statements.
Next, we derive expressions for the real exchange rate, which is likely to be
20

stationary regardless of the macroeconomic environment. We denote the log
of the foreign and domestic price levels as p∗t and p$t , respectively. The real
exchange rate is,
qt = st + p$t − p∗t .

(17)

We substitute the real exchange rate expression, (17), into the earlier expressions
for nominal exchange rates and rewrite to find the following result.
LEMMA 4:

qt = Et

∞
X

The level of the real exchange rate can be written as:

∗,∗
(λ$,∗
t+τ − λt+τ ) + Et

τ =0

$
∗
(rt+τ
− rt+τ
) − Et

τ =0

∞
X
τ =0

rp∗t+τ + Et [ lim qt+T ]
T →∞

(18)
where rt$ and rt∗ are the real interest rates, i.e., yt$ − Et [∆p$t+1 ] is the real dollar
interest rate.
The last term, q̄ = Et [limτ →∞ qt+τ ], is constant if the real exchange rate is
stationary.
The first component measures the impact of variation in the convenience
yield earned by foreign investors from holding U.S. Treasurys on the real exchange rate. The second component measures real yield differences, which the
effects of convenience yields earned by U.S. investors. The last component
measures risk premia. In Section V of this paper, we estimate each of these
components.

D.

The Treasury basis, Convenience Yields, and Dollarness
The key variable in our theory is λ$,∗
− λ∗,∗
t
t , the extra convenience yield

earned by foreign investors on their holdings of U.S. Treasurys in excess of the
foreign government bond. This object can be inferred from the Treasury basis.
To do so, we consider the foreign investor’s Euler equation for an investment in
a foreign government bond that is swapped into dollars via the forward market.
The investors owns a bundle of a safe foreign government bond, providing a convenience yield λ∗,∗
t , and a forward position. Together, these produce a synthetic
21

“Treasury” that is not as safe and liquid as the cash position in U.S. Treasurys,
because the synthetic position involves some bank counter-party risk and the
foreign bond is not as liquid as the U.S. Treasury bonds. Thus, we posit that
the synthetic position provides a convenience yield between that of the foreign
government bond and U.S. Treasurys:


∗,∗
$,∗
∗,∗
∗
∗ St+1 St yt∗
Et Mt+1
e
= e−λt −β (λt −λt ) .
St Ft1

(19)

Here Ft1 denotes the one-period forward exchange rate, in foreign currency per
dollar, and β ∗ , with 0 < β ∗ < 1, denotes the fraction of convenience yield on
the cash position in the foreign bond hedged into dollars relative to the U.S.
Treasury investment. We will estimate this fraction in our empirical work. If
β ∗ = 0, then the “dollarness” created by adding the forward position to the
foreign government bond provides no incremental convenience benefits to the
foreign investor. In this case, both U.S. Treasury bonds and foreign government
bonds are valued for their liquidity and safety properties in their respective
currencies. If β ∗ = 1, then the “dollarness” provided by the hedge converts the
foreign government bond to the equivalent of a U.S. Treasury. In this case, we
learn that investors particularly value safe and liquid bonds whose payoffs are
denominated in dollars.
We can use (19) along with the foreign investor’s Euler equation for the
U.S Treasury bond, (4), to find an expression for the unobserved U.S. Treasury
convenience yield gap.
LEMMA 5: The foreign convenience yield gap on U.S. Treasury bonds is proportional to the Treasury basis:
∗,∗
xTt reas ≡ yt$ + (ft1 − st ) − yt∗ = −(1 − β ∗ )(λ$,∗
t − λt ).

(20)

This lemma is the key to our empirical work as it provides a measure of the
convenience yields that drives our theory.

22

We can also consider the basis from from the standpoint of the U.S. investor.
Suppose the U.S. investor invests in the foreign bond swapped into dollars,
∗,$
$ $,$
$
and receives a convenience yield equal to λ∗,$
t + β (λt − λt ). Here again β

measures the fraction of convenience gained, relative to the U.S. Treasury bond,
by converting the foreign government bond into a dollar payoff. The basis can
be shown to be equal to,
∗,$
xTt reas = −(1 − β $ )(λ$,$
t − λt ),

which is equal to (20) when β $ = β ∗ , given the symmetry restriction in (12).3

We arrive at five key implications of our theory relating the Treasury basis

to the dollar exchange rate. We will test each of these in the data.

Joint Dynamics of the Dollar Exchange
Rate, the Treasury Basis, and the
Convenience Yield

Next, we explore the empirical implications of our theory. We begin by
showing that innovations to the Treasury basis covary with innovations in the
nominal dollar exchange rate, consistent with Result 5 of Proposition 1. We
also show that the basis predicts future returns to a foreign investor going long
Treasury bonds relative to foreign bonds, consistent with Result 3 of Proposition
1. We then show that our results are more broadly about dollar safe assets,
relate our results to the violation of LIBOR-based covered interest parity, and
show that our results are strongest for the dollar and do not extend to other
currencies to the same extent.

24

(25)

A.

Variation in the Treasury Basis and the Dollar
We start from the expression for exchange rate innovations (5) in Propo-

sition 1. We run a regression of exchange rate innovations on innovations to
the basis, controlling for news about future interest rate differences and currency risk premia, to estimate the effect of convenience yield news on the
value of the dollar. Innovations to the basis measure shocks to the demand
for safe dollars.4 This regression does not require exchange rate stationarity.
After controlling for discount rate and interest rate news, we get consistent
estimates of the slope coefficient β ∗ provided that the covariance between the
news about convenience yields and the long-run exchange rate tends to zero:


PT
reas
limT →∞ Cov (Et − Et−1 ) τ =0 xTt+τ
, (Et − Et−1 ) st+T = 0. If exchange
rates are stationary, this condition is trivially satisfied.
We construct quarterly AR(1) innovations in the Treasury basis by regressing
$
reas
reas
on xTt−1
and yt−1
− y ∗t−1 and computing the residual, ∆xTt reas .
xTt reas − xTt−1

We then regress the contemporaneous quarterly change in the spot exchange
rate, ∆st ≡ st − st−1 , on this innovation. Note that we have verified the
robustness of the results reported here to the case where the innovation ∆xTt reas
is the simple change in xTt reas rather than the AR(1) innovation. The results
are reported in the Separate Online Appendix. We simply use the change in the
log exchange rate as the innovation.
Table III reports the results. From columns (1), (3), (5), (6) and (8) in
Panel A, we see that the innovation in the Treasury basis strongly correlates
with changes in the exchange rate. In the context of the well-known exchange
rate disconnect puzzle (Froot and Rogoff, 1995; Frankel and Rose, 1995), the
R2 s are quite high. Our regressors account in panel A for 17% to 43% of the
variation in the dollar’s rate of appreciation. The sign is negative as predicted
by Proposition 1. The point estimates increase in absolute value in the postcrisis, as does the explanatory power. From column (1), we see that a 10 bps
4 We

cannot rule out that these include shocks to the demand for dollars that are subse-

quently invested in safe assets.

25

decrease in the basis (or an increase in the foreign convenience yield) below its
mean coincides with a 1.02% appreciation of the U.S. dollar.
The regression estimates provide a way to estimate β ∗ which is the incremental convenience yield attached to safe and liquid dollar payoffs relative to
foreign-currency safe and liquid payoffs. We assume that the annual basis follows an AR(1) with coefficient φa . From (5) in Proposition 1, it follows that
the innovation to the log exchange rate reflects the revision in the forecast of
the basis at t:

The basis is mean-reverting with a quarterly AR(1) coefficient of φ = 0.47.
Then, from (26) the sum of expected future increases in the 12-month basis in
response to a 10 bp rise in the 12-month basis today is 10 ×

1
1−0.474

= 10.5.

In order to rationalize the 1.02% appreciation in the exchange rate, we need a
value of β ∗ of 1 −

10.5
102

= 0.90, suggesting that much of the convenience yield

attached to U.S. Treasury bonds derives from its attribute as a safe and liquid
dollar payoff. Put differently, if U.S. Treasurys were issued in foreign currency,
their convenience yields would be substantially lower.
Column (3) of Table III includes the contemporaneous and the lagged innovation to the basis. This specification increases the R2 to 25%. The explanatory
power of the lag is certainly not consistent with our rational expectations model,
but it is the signature of delayed adjustment in the exchange rate to shocks to
the basis. Time-series momentum has been shown to be a common phenomenon
in many asset markets, including currency markets (see Moskowitz et al., 2012),
although there is no commonly agreed upon explanation for such phenomena.
The delayed adjustment lends support to the notion of expectational errors on
the part of currency market investors. Section D of the Appendix develops a
model of sticky expectations in currency markets that replicates the momentum
evidence. Froot and Thaler (1990); Gourinchas and Tornell (2004); Bacchetta

and Van Wincoop (2005) have argued that expectational errors are behind the
failure of uncovered interest rate parity in currency markets.
Column (4) of the table includes the innovation in the interest rate differential, y $ − y ∗ , constructed by taking an equal-weighted average of the one-year
Treasury yields. We see that increases in this interest rate spread has significant explanatory power in our sample. A rise in the U.S. rate relative to foreign
appreciates the currency, which is what textbook models of exchange rate determination will predict (and is what equation (13) predicts). Note that a decrease
in the convenience yields earned by U.S. investors will increase the U.S. Treasury yield y $ , and cause the dollar to appreciate. We include this covariate
in column (5) along with the basis innovation. The R2 rises to 43% and the
coefficient estimates and standard errors are nearly unchanged. This is because
the basis innovation and interest rate innovation are nearly uncorrelated in this
sample (note: the levels are negatively correlated).
These results are largely robust to controlling for changes in the VIX, a commonly used measure of the quantity of risk in global equity markets. These results are reported in Panel B. The baseline coefficient estimate decreases slightly
to −9.62. Following the same logic, we need a value of β ∗ of 1 − 10.5
96.2 = 0.89. In
the post-crisis sample, controlling for VIX brings the coefficient estimates back
in line with the pre-crisis estimates. The point estimate decreases from −14.93
to −10.44.
Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012) estimate that the convenience
yield on U.S. Treasury bonds relative to AAA rated corporate bonds averages
0.75%. They interpret the 0.75% in terms of the liquidity services and extra
safety of Treasury bonds relative to corporate bonds. We estimate that for1
eigners earn an extra convenience yield between 1.96% ( 0.112
× 0.22) and 2.09%
1
( 0.105
× 0.22) per annum on dollar Treasury bonds relative to foreign-currency

government bonds. Since β ∗ is around 0.9, we additionally learn that much of
this convenience benefit derives from the fact that the U.S. Treasury bond is a
liquid and safe dollar payoff.

28

Another approach to estimating the average convenience yield is to evaluate
the spread between the real long-run returns earned by foreign investors on U.S.
Treasurys and domestic bonds:

λ$,∗ − λ∗,∗ = −(R$,∗ − R∗,∗ ).

In the short run, the dollar exchange rate adjusts in response to changes in the
convenience yields. If real exchange rates are stationary, then there is no longrun currency adjustment and the long-horizon currency risk premium disappears
from (13) (see Backus et al., 2018; Lustig et al., 2019). Hence, this spread reveals
the (average) extra convenience yields earned by foreign investors when buying
Treasurys.
Our convenience yield estimates implies that real returns earned by foreign
investors on Treasurys need to be about 2% lower than the returns earned on
foreign bonds to maintain a stationary exchange rate.5 The Treasury International Capital (TIC) system records the purchases of Treasurys by foreign
investors. We use the TIC system data to compute the dollar-weighted returns
realized by foreign investors: The dollar-weighted return is the internal rate of
return realized on the cash flows invested by foreign investors. We assume that
investors are fully invested in the Bloomberg Barclays Treasury Index. Between
1980 and 2019, private foreign investors earned a dollar-weighted real return
on their Treasury purchases of 2.77%, expressed in real dollars. In comparison,
foreign investors earned a dollar-weighted real return of 4.66% on their holdings
of foreign bonds.

R∗,∗ − R$,∗ = 4.66% − 2.77% = 1.89% = λ$,∗ − λ∗,∗ .

The 1.89% gap is a direct estimate of the long-run difference in convenience
5 Our

result is qualitatively in line with the savings glut hypothesis (see, e.g., Caballero

et al., 2008; Caballero and Krishnamurthy, 2008) and the low r-star discussion (see Laubach
and Williams, 2003, 2016; Holston et al., 2017).

29

yields (λ$,∗ − λ$,$ ). Foreign investors buy U.S. Treasurys when Treasurys are
expensive, consistent with our hypothesis that foreigners have a special demand
for U.S. dollar safe assets. This estimate is quantitatively in line with the
estimates we backed out of the Treasury basis and FX markets.

B.

LIBOR and Treasury Bases
Columns (2), (7), and (9) of Table III shows that the LIBOR basis has

explanatory power in the post-crisis sample. This result has been documented
in prior work by Avdjiev et al. (2019). We note that the LIBOR basis has no
explanatory power in the pre-crisis sample, and moreover has less explanatory
power for the dollar than the Treasury basis. Furthermore, Du et al. (2018b)
document that the LIBOR basis was near zero pre-crisis and has often been
significantly different than zero post-crisis. They show that the movements in
the LIBOR basis are closely connected to frictions in financial intermediation
that hamper arbitrage activities. We next discuss these results and connect
them to our safe asset theory. Section B of the Appendix develops a model
of the supply of dollar-denominated LIBOR deposits. Suppose that foreign
investors derive a convenience yield on both dollar Treasury bonds and other
dollar safe assets, including bank deposits paying LIBOR, consistent with our
estimate of β ∗ near 0.9. Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012) present
evidence that there is a convenience yield on both U.S. Treasury bonds and
other near-riskless private bonds such as U.S. bank deposits. Some investors
view near-riskless private bonds as partial substitutes for Treasury bonds.
This being the case, we expect an increase in foreign demand for Treasurys to
drive down the foreign return to holding Treasurys, that is to induce a widening
of the Treasury basis, and drive down the foreign return to holding dollar LIBOR
bank deposits. In particular, consider the LIBOR basis, which is the spread
between dollar LIBOR deposits and a foreign LIBOR deposit swapped into
dollars,


xLIBOR
≡ yt$,LIBOR + ft1 − st − yt∗,LIBOR .
t
30

(27)

All else equal, an increase in foreign demand for dollar safe assets will drive down
yt$,LIBOR and widen the LIBOR basis. However, this widening of the LIBOR
basis presents a riskless profit opportunity for a bank that funds itself in both
dollars and foreign currency. In particular, faced with a widening LIBOR basis,
a bank can increase its supply of dollar deposits by one dollar, swap the one
dollar into foreign currency so that its currency risk remains unchanged and
strictly increase its profits by xLIBOR
.
t
In the pre-crisis period, banks were active on this margin and hence the
LIBOR basis is zero, consistent with the analysis of Du et al. (2018b). The
LIBOR basis did not reflect foreign safe asset demand. Effectively, quantities
rather than prices adjusted to accommodate any shifts in safe-asset demand.
In the post-crisis period, regulatory constraints on banks limit the capacity of
banks to conduct the arbitrage, as Du et al. (2018b) emphasize. In this case, the
LIBOR basis opens up. Prices adjust because quantities cannot. The LIBOR
basis now reflects both safe asset demand and banks’ regulatory constraints.
In our explanation, the LIBOR basis widens because of both “demand” – a
willingness on the part of one set of agents to overpay for dollar deposits – and
“supply” – a limited capacity of other agents to supply these dollar deposits.
Other recent papers similarly cite both a demand factor and limited supply
factor as driving the LIBOR basis (see Ivashina et al., 2015).
Our analysis explains why the LIBOR basis comoves with the Treasury basis
in the post-crisis period, as is evident from Figure 1 and why the LIBOR basis
explains movements in the dollar exchange rate post-crisis. In short, when bank
regulatory constraints restrict their arbitrage activities, the LIBOR basis reflects
movements in λ$,∗
t . This raises the question of why the Treasury basis persists,
given that the Treasury is unconstrained and could issue more Treasurys, similar
to what banks do in LIBOR markets prior to the crisis. The answer must be
that the Treasury, unlike unconstrained banks, chooses not to exploit this basis,
because it has other objectives in managing the government debt portfolio. For
example, as in the analysis of Farhi and Maggiori (2018), the U.S. Treasury may

31

seek to earn monopoly rents on in its provision of convenience-yielding Treasury
bonds.

C.

Term Structure of Treasury Bases
Thus far we have focused exclusively on the 1Y Treasury basis, but there is

additional information contained in the term structure of Treasury bases about
convenience yields. We compute the average G10 Treasury basis for each tenor,
1Y, 2Y, 3Y, 5Y, 7Y, and 10Y, by averaging across countries in a similar manner
as we have described. The 1Y basis is from our data, and the rest is from Du
et al. (2018a). To reduce the dimension of the Treasury bases constructed by
Du et al. (2018a), we carry out a principal component analysis (PCA) on these
Treasury bases. Their data covers a shorter sample than we do and hence we
limit our analysis to the period ranging from 1991Q2 to 2017Q2.
The results of the PCA are reported in Table IV. Similar to the term structure of bond yields, the first three PCs of the Treasury bases correspond to a
level, a slope and a curvature basis factor. We can see this from the loadings
on the PCs. These three factors explain 96% of the variation in the Treasury
bases.

Table V reports the results of a regression of the quarterly rate of appreci32

ation of the dollar on the innovations in the level factor and the slope factor,
controlling for changes in the interest rate differences. The quarterly innovations
are obtained from an AR(1) model with lagged PC1, lagged PC2 and lagged
Treasury yield differential. A one standard deviation decline in the level of the
bases by 0.41% induces an appreciation of the dollar by 3.78% (9.29 × 0.41).
There is also information in the innovations in the slope factor. If the slope
rises, i.e., short-term bases fall relative to the long-term bases, the dollar appreciates. A rise in the slope may be coincident with a flight to quality which
affects short-term bonds more than long-term bonds. That is, the basis on the 1
year bond may be a better measure of foreign investors’ convenience valuations
than the basis on the long-term bonds.

Monetary Policy Shocks and the Basis
To help us identify the causal effect of shocks to the basis on the dollar

exchange rate, we rely on Federal Funds Rate (FFR) surprises. There is a growing literature on high-frequency identification, going back to Rudebusch (1998);
Kuttner (2001); Cochrane and Piazzesi (2002); Faust et al. (2004). FOMC announcements are useful source of variation because the news in these announcements is primarily about short rates. We use Kuttner (2001)’s FFR surprises
as our measure of monetary shocks. There are 96 observations in our sample.

We end the sample when the FFR hits the zero lower bound.6
How does a monetary policy surprise cause a change in the convenience
yield? In Jiang et al. (2020a), we develop a theory that creates a role for
monetary policy in the determination of convenience yields. In that model,
tighter monetary policy induces banks to scale down their balance sheets. Since
banks are important providers of dollar safe assets, the contraction reduces the
supply of dollar safe assets. As a result, demanders of safe assets drive up the
price of these assets leading to an increased convenience yield.
In the first stage, we regress the change in the first principal component of
the basis on the MP shock. We argue that a contractionary monetary policy
shrinks the supply of liquid and safe assets and widen the basis. The first stage
regressions confirm this effect. These results are reported in the upper panel
in Table VI. We use P C1 as the average basis measure. A 10 bps surprise rate
increase widens the average Treasury basis by more than 5.8 basis points. In
the second stage, we regress the dollar appreciation on the exogenous variation
in the basis induced by the FFR surprise. These results are reported in the
lower panel in Table VI. The exclusion restriction is that shocks to MP do
not covary with the exchange rates, once we control for changes in interest
rates. In terms of the exchange rate decomposition in (21), we assume that
only the future convenience yields and future interest rates respond to FFR
surprises, but not the future currency risk premia. Given that most of the
news on these days is about short rates, that seems like a plausible restriction.
There is one caveat: we include unscheduled announcements, which are more
likely to include the release of news about fundamentals. The second stage slope
coefficients are comparable in magnitude to the OLS estimates in Table III: The
slope coefficients vary between −11.98 and −13.93. A 10 bps widening of the
Treasury bases induces an appreciation of the dollar between 1.20% and 1.39%.
Controlling for changes in VIX decreases the size of these coefficients in absolute
value, but only moderately so.
6 These

results are also discussed and reported in Krishnamurthy and Lustig (2019).

E.

The Treasury Basis and Dollar Safe Asset Demand
Our theory posits that a specific form of capital flows consisting of flows into

safe dollar assets drives the value of the U.S. dollar. This section discusses how
our evidence supports this interpretation.
First, note that we construct the basis from the safest asset, the U.S. Treasury bond, and document a relation between this basis and the dollar. Second,
we have shown that the LIBOR basis also helps explain movements in the dollar
post-crisis, consistent with the broad dollar safe asset demand theory. Third,
we have shown that β ∗ is around 0.90 indicating that safe foreign government
bonds when swapped into dollars carry a convenience yield. Fourth, we compute a KfW bond basis in section A of the separate Online Appendix. KfW is a
German issuer whose bonds are backed by the German government, so that they
are near default free. KfW issues bonds in different currencies allowing us to
compute the basis for the bonds of the same issuer, i.e., holding safety fixed, in
different currencies. We compute the basis for KfW bonds using one-year yields
on these bonds for Australia, Euro, UK, and Switzerland against the U.S.. The
KfW and the Treasury bases have roughly the same magnitude and track each
other closely. This evidence shows that foreign investors’ demand is for all safe
assets denominated in U.S. dollars.
Lastly, we perform a placebo test of dollar safe asset demand. We repeat
the univariate regression of Table III, column (1), but using other non-U.S.
countries as the base country. In Table VII, we use a different base country,
and we calculate the equally weighted cross-sectional average of exchange rates
and Treasury basis of other non-U.S. countries against this base country’s currency. In the top panel, we report the coefficient of the regression of nominal
exchange rate movement on the Treasury basis innovation. For other countries

36

the regression coefficients are largely statistically insignificant and/or the R2 are
considerably lower than the U.S. regressions. That is, the negative association
between the exchange rate movement and Treasury basis is a phenomenon that
is particularly strong for the U.S. where we posit that these safe asset demand
effects should be most pronounced. In Panel B of the table we include both
the innovation in the basis and the change in interest rate differences. Now the
regression R2 rise uniformly. Additionally, more of the currencies exhibit the
negative relation between bases and exchange rates. In the last panel, we report a univariate regression with only changes in interest rate differences. From
comparing the regression R2 s in Panels B and C we can see that only in the
case of the dollar does the basis add substantial explanatory power. The Euro
shares some of the U.S. Dollar patterns, but to a much lesser extent.

F.

Predictability of Exchange Rates and Excess Returns
We next turn to Result 3 of Proposition 1, which can be read as a forecast-

ing regression. A more negative xt (i.e. a higher convenience yield) today is
associated with a higher dollar exchange rate today, which induces an expected
depreciation in the future. For the forecast horizon k, we define the annualized

$
log excess return as rxt→t+k = k4 ∆st→t+k + yt→t+k
− y ∗t→t+k . Note that the
LHS of equation (23), reproduced below,


Et [∆st+1 ] + yt$ − yt∗ =

1
xT reas + rp∗t ,
1 − β∗ t

is akin to the return on the reverse currency carry trade. It involves going
long the U.S. Treasury bond, funded by borrowing at the rate of the foreign
government bond. The carry trade return has a risk premium term (RP ), and
following the literature, a proxy for this risk premium is the interest rate differential across the countries. Thus we include the mean Treasury yield differential

$
yt→t+k
− y ∗t→t+k as a control in our regression. As we have shown in Table
III, there is a slow adjustment to basis shocks. So, we use the average Trea-

37

Table VII. Explain Exchange Rate Movement Using Treasury Basis Innovation
in Different Countries.
We regress the exchange rate movement on concurrent Treasury basis innovation and change
in the Treasury yield. A higher exchange rate means a stronger base currency. For each nonU.S. country, we exclude the U.S. when we calculate its average Treasury basis and average
exchange rate movement against other non-U.S. countries. One, two and three stars denote
statistical significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% level. We use DEM as stand-in for EUR prior
to the creation of the Euro.

Our theory suggests that the coefficient βx should be positive. We run this regression using quarterly data, but compute the returns on the LHS as 3-months,
1-year, 2-year, and 3-year returns. Because there is overlap in the observations,
we compute heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation adjusted standard errors.
Table VIII reports the results obtained when forecasting the annualized excess returns on a long position in the dollar. Overall the results are in line
with our theory: a more negative basis (i.e. higher convenience yields) predicts
lower returns on the carry trade. However, we should note that the statistical
significance of the results is weak, and the results of this section should be seen
as a consistency check of our theory. The sample for a forecasting regression is
relatively short, and even the known forecaster of currency returns, the interest
rate differential, has limited power in this sample.
Panel A reports the regression results for the entire sample. The slope
coefficient on the average basis βxk varies from −1.46 at the 3-month horizon to
4.44 at the 3-year horizon. The long-horizon estimates are an accurate reflection
of the basis effect after stripping away the short-run momentum effect we have
documented whereby the exchange rate adjusts slowly to changes in the basis.
The effects are economically significant. A one-standard-deviation basis shock
of 23 bps raises the expected excess return by 1.02% per annum over the next
three years. These regressors jointly explain about 14% of the variation in excess
returns at the 3-year horizon. The basis is not a persistent predictor, and the
Stambaugh (1999) bias is likely small. Further, there is no strong mechanical
relation between the forecasting horizon and the R2 .
Panel B and C of Table VIII report the regression results for the pre- and
post-crisis sample. The momentum effect is only present prior to the crisis.

In the post-crisis sample, the slope coefficients on the basis are all positive. At
the 3-year horizon, the coefficient is 10.04: A one-standard-deviation basis shock
raises the expected excess return by 2.31% per annum over the next three years.
Consistent with the findings of Lilley et al. (2019), we note that there is much
more predictability after the crisis. In the post-crisis sample, these regressors
jointly explain about 34% of the joint variation in excess returns at the 3-year
horizon.
The return predictability is mostly driven by the exchange rate component
of returns. Table A.9 in Section C of the Appendix report predictability results
for exchange rate changes rather than excess returns. There is solid statistical
evidence that the average Treasury basis forecasts changes in exchange rates: the
slope coefficient estimate is 5.17, implying that the dollar appreciates by 1.19%
per annum over the next 3 years following one-standard-deviation widening of
average Treasury basis.
In Section H of the Appendix, we construct a longer sample for the U.S.U.K. Treasury basis (the sample starts 1970Q1 and ends in 2016Q2), and we
run the same battery of statistical tests. The results are broadly in line with
the results obtained on the shorter sample for the G-10 currencies.

G.

Term Structure and Excess Returns
We next investigate whether other maturities of the basis have forecasting

power for excess returns on the reverse carry trade. We summarize the other
maturities using the principal component of the term structure and use these
to forecast excess returns. As before, we lag these principal components by one
period.
Panel A of Table IX reports the predictability results for the entire sample.
When the bases widen across all tenors, this leads to lower excess returns at all
horizons, with results that are statistically stronger at longer horizons. A one
standard deviation widening of P C1 by 41 bps leads to a 2.92% (2.01%) per
annum reduction in the excess return at the two-year (three-year) horizon. The

41

second principal component, the slope factor P C2 , has much less information
for returns than the level factor. The coefficient on P C2 is positive but only
statistically different than zero at the 3-month horizon. From our theory, the
coefficient on the slope should be negative. That is, we find in Table V that
increases in slope lead to a contemporaneous appreciation of the dollar. We thus
should expect that increases in slope predict a future depreciation of the dollar.
The results do not accord with this prediction. The positive coefficient at the
3-month horizon may be another manifestation of the momentum phenomenon.
Panels B and C of Table IX report the results for the pre- and post-crisis subsamples. The results are stronger in the post-crisis sample consistent with earlier
results.
A significant finding from this PC analysis is that there is considerable information in the entire term structure of the bases. We note the high R2 in Table
IX compared to that of Table VIII. The principal components explain significant variation in excess returns, rising to 30% at the 3-year horizon, compared
to 14% at the 3-year horizon in Table VIII.

Reduced-Form VAR and Impulse Response

We estimate following the first-order VAR for zt :

where Γ0 is a 3-dimensional vector, Γ1 is a 3 × 3 matrix and at is a sequence of
white noise random vector with mean zero and variance covariance matrix Σ.

Estimation
We estimate the VAR system using quarterly data. In order to convert the

1-year Treasury basis to an equivalent 3-month Treasury basis, we scale the
1-year Treasury basis and interest rate differentials. Section F of the Appendix
contains the details.
We identified the VAR(1) as the optimal specification using the BIC. This
specification assumes that the log of the real U.S. dollar index is stationary,
which seems to be case in this sample period. We order the VAR so that shocks
to the basis affect all variables contemporaneously, shocks to the interest rate
affect the exchange rate and the interest rate differential but not the basis, and
shocks to the exchange rate only affect itself. This ordering implies that nominal and real exchange rates can respond instantaneously to all of the structural
shocks. As we discuss, the evidence from the VAR provides support for interpreting our regression evidence causally: shocks to convenience yields drive

Figure 2. Dynamic Response to Treasury Basis Shocks: Panel.
The red line plots the impulse response of a one-standard-deviation orthogonalized shock to
the average Treasury basis on the basis (top left panel), the real interest rate differential (top
right panel), the log real spot exchange rate (bottom left panel), and the quarterly log excess
return on a long position in dollars (bottom right panel). The units for the y-axis are in
percentage points. The grey areas indicates 95% confidence intervals. Standard errors were
generated using 10,000 Monte Carlo hsimulations. The
i VAR is estimated using a sample from
1988Q1 to 2017Q2. The ordering is xt , rt$ − r∗t , qt .

44

Figure 2 plots the impulse response from orthogonalized shocks to the basis.
The top left panel plots the dynamic behavior of the basis (in units of percentage points), the top right panel plots the dynamic behavior of the interest rate
difference (in percentage points), and the bottom left panel plots the behavior of
the exchange rate (in percentage points). The dynamics in the figure are consistent with the regression evidence from the Tables. An increase in the annualized
Treasury basis of 0.2% (quarterly basis of 0.1% in figure) depreciates the real
exchange rate contemporaneously by about 3% over two quarters. The finding
that the depreciation persists over 2 quarters is consistent with the time-series
momentum effect discussed earlier. Thus, the exchange rate exhibits classic
Dornbusch (1976) overshooting behavior. Then there is a gradual reversal over
the next 5 years; the effect on the level of the dollar gradually dissipates. There
is no statistically discernible effect of the basis on the interest rate differential.
Finally, the bottom right panel plots the quarterly log excess return on a long
position in dollars, rxt = qt − qt−1 + it−1 . Initially, the quarterly excess return drops, but after the first 2 quarters, it is higher than average for the next
15 to 18 quarters, consistent with higher expected returns on long positions in
Treasurys.
Once we add the basis shock, U.I.P. roughly holds for the dollar against this
panel of currencies. Figure 3 plots the response to the interest rate shocks. The
dollar appreciates in real terms in the same quarter by more than 100 basis
points in response to a 100 bps increase in the U.S. yields above the foreign
yields. The bottom right panel of the figure plots the excess return on the
currency, and we see that this return is zero after the first quarter indicating
that U.I.P. holds once we account for shocks to the basis. As pointed out by
Engel (2016), the deviations from U.I.P. in the univariate time series regressions
are larger for the dollar. Our results indicate that these deviations may be
largely due to variation in the convenience yield on dollar safe assets.
Figure 4 reports all of the impulse responses. The panel in the lower right
corner plots the variance decomposition of the exchange rate against the horizon.

45

Basis shocks account for a large fraction of the exchange rate forecast error
variance, especially at longer horizons. At the one-quarter horizon, basis shocks
account for around 20% of the forecast error variance; this fraction increases to
35% at longer horizons. In contrast, the interest rate shocks account for less
than 25% at all horizons. While the initial impact of a one-standard deviation
interest rate shock on the dollar is similar to that of a one-standard deviation
basis shock (roughly 2%), its effect builds up more gradually..
Importantly, the results are not sensitive to switching the order of the basis
and interest rate differential, indicating that we can plausibly interpret the
relation between the basis and exchange rate causally: A shock to convenience
yields moves both the basis and the exchange rate. We say this because we have
allowed for other known determinants of the exchange rate, relative price levels
and relative interest rates, and yet recover the same relation between the basis

Campbell-Shiller Decomposition
The log of the currency excess return is given by rxt = qt − qt−1 + it−1 .

By Proposition 1.3, the realized risk premium component of the log currency
excess return is the realized log excess return minus the convenience yield: rpt =
rxt −

1
1−β ∗

× xt−1 . As a result, we can add an equation for the risk premium

component of the log excess return to the VAR, and we end up with the following

Figure 5 plots the dollar’s news about convenience yields against the news
about the dollar exchange rate. The light-shaded areas include the ERM crisis,
the Gulf war, the Russian default and LTCM crisis and the recent global financial crisis. Most of the variation in CY news arises during periods of increased
global uncertainty and during crises. During global crisis episodes, the CY news
induces an appreciation of the USD during global financial crises, when global
investors seek the safety of the USD safe assets. During the recent crisis, CY
news induced an appreciation of 5% of the USD. However, these effects are
largely transitory, given that the basis quickly reverts back to its mean.
While the convenience yield component is clearly tied to global crises, the
cash flow and discount rate news seem more related to the U.S. business cycle.
Figure 6 plots the cash flow news against the news about the dollar exchange
rate. The dark-shaded areas indicate NBER recessions. The cash flow news
component of the dollar is clearly counter-cyclical. At the start of NBER recessions, US yields decline relative to foreign yields, thus contributing to a

Table X presents the variance decomposition of quarterly dollar exchange

yield news (CY ) accounts for 16% of the variance in quarterly exchange rates.
Interest rate news (CF ) accounts for a similar share of the variance, while risk

premium news (DR) accounts for a sizable component of 110%. These results
are sensitive to the exact value of β ∗ . When β ∗ = 0.875, the CY news accounts
for only 10% of exchange rate innovations, while if β ∗ = 0.95, the CY news
accounts for 63% of innovations. The ratio of the convenience yield to the

Conclusion

We present a theory of exchange rates which departs from existing theories
by imputing a central role to international flows in Treasury debt and related
dollar safe asset markets in exchange rate determination. In our theory, the
spot exchange rate of a safe asset currency will reflect the cumulative value of
all future convenience yields that are earned by foreign investors on safe assets
denominated in that currency. The empirical evidence strongly supports the
theory. Our results shed light on two important topics in international finance.
First, we help to resolve the exchange rate disconnect puzzle by demonstrating
that shocks to the demand for dollar-denominated safe assets drive a sizeable
portion of the variation in the dollar exchange rate. Second, we provide strong
empirical support for recent theories regarding safe assets and the central role
of the U.S. in the international monetary system.

Data Sources

We start by discussing the Panel Dataset. For the FX data, before December 1996, we
use the Barclays Bank source from Datastream. After December 1996, we use World Markets
Reuters (WMR) from Datastream. The Datastream codes for the spot rates and 12M forward rates are: BBGBPSP, BBGBPYF, BBAUDSP, BBAUDYF, BBCADSP, BBCADYF,
BBDEMSP, BBDEMYF, BBJPYSP, BBJPYYF, BNZDSP, BBNZDYF, BBNOKSP, BBNOKYF, BBSEKSP, BBSEKYF, BBCHFSP, BBCHFYF, AUSTDOL, UKAUDYF, CNDOLLR, UKCADYF, DMARKER, UKDEMYF, JAPAYEN, UKJPYYF, NZDOLLR,

For the Government Bond Yields (see Table A.2), most country-maturities pairs only use
one source, except if there are gaps. If there are gaps, we use all the data from the first
source wherever available, as indicated in the Table, and then fill in any gaps for some year

the BBA-ICE LIBOR when available. Coverage is good for Germany, Japan, Switzerland,
UK, and U.S.. For other countries, we then use other interbank survey rates (BBSW, CDOR,
NIBOR, STIBOR) to fill in any gaps. We then use deposit rates (Bank Bill, NKD, SKD) for
any remaining gaps.

Our second dataset covers the U.S./U.K. cross. This data begins much earlier, in 1970Q1
and ends in 2016Q2. The daily data quality is poor, with many missing values and implausible
spikes in the constructed basis from one day to the next. To overcome these measurement
issues, we take the average of the available data for a given quarter as the observation for that
quarter. We construct the Treasury basis in the same manner as described earlier. We rely
on Global Financial Data as the main data source.

Figure A.1 plots the resulting series. LIBOR rates do not exist back to 1971. The
average U.S./U.K. Treasury basis is 0.84 bps per annum. On average, U.K. investors are
close to indifferent between holding U.S. Treasurys on a currency-hedged basis and holding
gilts. However, the standard deviation is 48 bps. per quarter. For comparison the figure also
plots the mean basis from the cross-country panel. The two series track each other closely
for the period where they overlap, but the U.S./U.K. basis is consistently higher than the
panel basis. This result suggests that UK bonds also have a convenience yield, which is
sometimes larger than that of U.S. bonds particularly in the 1970s, during which the basis
is volatile and frequently positive. Suffering a balance-of-payments deficit in the early 1970s,
the Nixon administration decided to suspend convertibility of the dollar into gold in 1973
and effectively ended the Bretton-Woods system. This action led to considerable uncertainty
in the international monetary system, with some observers noting that foreigners became
unwilling to continue to hold the dollar assets necessary to finance the balance-of-payments
deficit (see Bach (1972) and Farhi and Maggiori (2018)). Additionally, the U.K. suffered a
balance-of-payments crisis in 1976, turning to the IMF for a large loan. These reductions in
asset demand, first for U.S. and then for U.K. bonds, are apparent in the figure: the basis
turns positive in 1973 before subsequently turning negative in 1976.

Appendix B.

Theory of Convenience Yields
and Exchange Rates

This section explores two issues: (i) what happens in a complete markets environment to
exchange rates when investors derive convenience yields, and (ii) an analysis of the role of the
banking sector in LIBOR markets.

A.

Convenience Yields in Complete Markets
We follow the approach of Backus et al. (2001). Consider the Euler equations (3) and (8)

for the U.S. and foreign investor when investing in an asset with no convenience yield. To
satisfy these Euler equations, we conjecture an exchange rate process that satisfies, Mt$ SSt

t+1

Mt∗ .

=

This guess, as can easily be verified, satisfies the Euler equations for a no-convenience

yield asset. If financial markets are complete, then this is the unique exchange rate process
that is consistent with the absence of arbitrage opportunities. Using lower case letters to
denote logs, and log-linearizing this expression, we find:
∆st+1

m$t − m∗t .

=

(B1)

Next consider the pair of Euler equations, (4) and (9), which apply to investments in the U.S.
bond that gives a convenience yield. We conjecture an exchange rate process that satisfies,
$,∗

Mt∗ eλt

$,$
St+1
= Mt$ eλt .
St

After taking logs, we find:
∆st+1

=


 

m$t − m∗t + λ$,$
− λ$,∗
t
t

(B2)

It is evident that (B1) and (B2) cannot both be satisfied in an equilibrium unless λ$,∗
= λ$,$
t
t .
But note that in this case, convenience yields have no impact on exchange rates.

B.

Convenience Yields in Incomplete Markets
To develop a full-fledged exchange rate model, we conjecture that the exchange rate

process satisfies:
$
Mt+1
exp(λ$,$
St+1
t )
=
exp(ηt+1 ),
∗
St
Mt+1
exp(λ$,∗
t )

where ηt+1 represents an incomplete markets stochastic wedge. When markets are complete,
ηt+1 = 0 in all states of the world, and the U.S. and foreign bond investor’s Euler equations
for Treasurys are automatically satisfied. In addition, we assume that the wedges and the
pricing kernels are jointly log-normal.

5

The change in the log exchange rate can be stated as follows: ∆st+1 = ηt+1 + m$t+1 −
m∗t+1 − λ$,∗
+ λ$,$
t
t . We impose the symmetry restriction on the convenience yields stated in
(12).
PROPOSITION 2: When the exchange rate change is ∆st+1 = ηt+1 + m$t+1 − m∗t+1 − λ$,∗
t +
$,$
∗,$
λ$,$
− λ$,∗
− λ∗,∗
t , and (λt

vart (ηt+1 ) ,
2

−Et (ηt+1 ) + vart (ηt+1 ) .

−Et (ηt+1 ) −

The variance of the exchange rate is given by: vart (∆st+1 ) = vart (mt+1 ) + vart (m∗t+1 ) −
2covt (mt+1 , m∗t+1 ) − vart (ηt+1 ).
The incomplete market wedges have to satisfy restrictions to enforce the Euler equations
for bond market investors (see Backus and Smith, 1993; Lustig and Verdelhan, 2019). That
accounts for the covariance restrictions. Given the symmetry condition we impose on the
convenience yields, the moment conditions for the incomplete markets wedges do not depend
on the convenience yields.

Convenience yields on LIBOR deposits, the LIBOR basis, and
the Treasury basis
In U.S. data, Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012) observe that there is a con-

venience yield on both Treasury bonds and other near-riskless private bonds such as bank
deposits. They moreover show that some investors view near-riskless private bonds as partial
substitutes for Treasury bonds. This section introduces LIBOR bank deposits which also offer
convenience yields, but less so than U.S. Treasurys. That is, as noted earlier, our theory posits
that investors receive convenience utility from U.S. safe assets, a set that includes both U.S.
Treasurys and bank deposits. We first show how to understand the LIBOR basis and safe
asset demand in this case, and then offer another way to understand the Treasury basis.
Foreign and domestic investors have access to U.S. LIBOR markets, and they satisfy the
following Euler equations:

where β ∗,LIBOR < 1 (β $,LIBOR ) denotes the fraction of convenience yield from the LIBOR
bank deposit relative to the Treasury bond derived by foreign (U.S.) investors.

Next we construct the LIBOR basis in a similar manner as Section D. Suppose a foreign investor purchases a foreign LIBOR deposit and swaps the deposit into dollars. This
investment satisfies the investor’s Euler equation:

Here Ft1 denotes the one-period forward exchange rate, in foreign currency per dollar, and
β ∗,LIBOR−H λ$,∗
denotes the fraction of convenience yield on the cash position in the foreign
t
bank deposit hedged into dollars relative to a U.S. Treasury investment. We use equation
(B7) along with the foreign investor’s Euler equation for the dollar LIBOR deposit, to find an
expression for the LIBOR basis:
xLIBOR
≡ yt$,LIBOR + (ft1 − st ) − yt∗,LIBOR = −(β ∗,LIBOR − β ∗,LIBOR−H )λ$,∗
t
t .

(B8)

If a synthetically created dollar deposit is as good as a cash dollar deposit for an investor,
the right hand side is zero and the LIBOR basis is zero. From the investor demand-side, a
negative LIBOR basis indicates a preference for the cash deposit compared to the synthetic
deposit.
We next reconsider the Treasury basis in light of the LIBOR basis:
reas
xT
t

=

yt$ − yt∗ + ft − st = (yt$ − yt$,LIBOR ) − (yt∗ − yt∗,LIBOR ) + xLIBOR
. (B9)
t

The Treasury basis is the sum of the LIBOR basis and the difference between the two currency’s Treasury-LIBOR spreads. From the Euler equations for the foreign investment in U.S.
Treasurys and U.S. dollar LIBOR deposits we find that:
yt$,LIBOR − yt$ = (1 − β ∗,LIBOR )λ$,∗
t
We make a parallel assumption that the foreign investor receives a fraction β ∗,LIBOR of the
convenience when investing in the foreign deposit relative to the foreign bond. Thus the
foreign Treasury-LIBOR spread is:
yt∗,LIBOR − yt∗ = (1 − β ∗,LIBOR )λ∗,∗
t
Rewriting the Treasury basis we find that:
reas

xT
= (1 − β ∗,LIBOR )(λ$,∗

We conclude that the Treasury basis measures the foreign demand for U.S. safe assets through
$,$
both the excess Treasury convenience yield, λ$,∗

movements in the LIBOR basis. We can go one step further by substituting in from the LIBOR

When the cash position is more valiable to investors than the synthetic, β ∗,LIBOR−H <
β ∗,LIBOR , the Treasury basis is effectively enlarged.
It is useful to compare this derivation of the basis to the one from Section D. We found
that,

Here β ∗ summarized the foreign investor’s preference for the synthetic Treasury bond relative
to the cash Treasury bond. Note that β ∗ does not have to be equal to β ∗,LIBOR . However
they are related in that both reflect dollarness, safety, and synthetic-vs-cash in convenience
valuations.
We next consider the banks that make the supply-side of the deposit market. Suppose
that xLIBOR
< 0, i.e. investors are willing to pay a premium for a cash dollar LIBOR deposit
t
compared to the synthetically created deposit. Banks issue foreign and dollar deposits that
pay LIBOR at rates yt∗,LIBOR and yt$,LIBOR . The dollar deposits offer a convenience yield to
investors but not to the banks, so that banks will wish to issue these deposits in equilibrium.
Consider a given bank that has a mix of deposits in both currencies in (dollar-equivalent)
amounts (θ̄tB,$ , θ̄tB,∗ ). We suppose the mix is optimal for the bank given asset/liability management concerns and the currency mix of the rest of its balance sheet. If bank deposits offer
convenience yields, than banks will create these deposits, and the limit on such deposit creation
will be governed by bank costs in creating the deposits. See the model of Krishnamurthy and
Vissing-Jorgensen (2015) for one specification of intermediaries doing asset/liability management and creating money where the cost is in terms of collateral backing. We have suppressed
the specification of these costs to not stray from our primary analysis which is exchange rate
determination. Think of the optimal mix (θ̄tB,$ , θ̄tB,∗ ) as being driven by these costs.
Suppose that the bank also trades in the forward market. Clearly if the convenience yield
on the cash dollar deposits rises relative to synthetic foreign deposits, the bank will want to
supply more of these dollar deposits and hedge these using the forward market to maintain
its optimal currency mix. Then the bank chooses θtB , the quantity of this swap, to achieve
deposit mix (θ̄tB,$ + θtB , θ̄tB,∗ − θtB ). If there is greater demand for dollar deposits the bank
will on the margin increase θtB . Suppose the bank solves:

 κ  2
max θtB yt∗,LIBOR − (ft − st ) − yt$,LIBOR −
θB .
B
2 t
θt
Here κ is a capital/leverage cost associated with doing the forward and hedging the dollar
deposits. The term yt∗,LIBOR − (ft − st ) − yt$,LIBOR is the funding cost reduction that the

9

bank gets when taking advantage of the dollar convenience yield. The F.O.C. for the bank is,
−κθtB

=

yt$,LIBOR − yt∗,LIBOR + (ft − st )

=

xLIBOR
t

where xLIBOR
denotes the LIBOR basis. If yt$,LIBOR is particularly low, e.g., driven by
t
an increase in demand for dollar deposits, then xLIBOR
will rise and banks will increase the
t
supply of dollar deposits, θtB , while swapping these dollars deposits back into foreign currency
to keep their exchange rate exposure unaffected. Suppose there are many banks and denote
the aggregate quantity of dollar deposits supplied in equilibrium as ΘB
t . Then, the equilibrium
LIBOR basis is given by:
xLIBOR
= −κΘB
t
t .

(B10)

LEMMA 6: The LIBOR basis depends on foreign demand for dollar deposits as follows:
When banks face no capital/leverage costs in doing swaps and κ = 0, the LIBOR basis is
zero and independent of ΘB
t . When κ > 0, the LIBOR basis becomes more negative as the
demand for dollar safe assets rises.
In the frictionless case, as κ goes to zero, banks actively trade in the forward to earn the
convenience yield on dollar deposits while not altering their exchange rate exposure. In equilibrium, the price of the forward will adjust to equalize these margins and the LIBOR CIP
deviation goes to zero. Perhaps surprisingly. the forward price, ft1 , can embed a convenience
yield.
In an influential recent paper, Du et al. (2018b) document that the LIBOR basis was
near zero pre-crisis and has often been significantly different than zero post-crisis. They
show that the movements in the LIBOR basis are closely connected to frictions in financial
intermediation that prevent arbitrage activities. Other papers have come to similar conclusions
regarding the importance of financial frictions and capital controls (see Ivashina et al., 2015;
Gabaix and Maggiori, 2015; Amador et al., 2020; Itskhoki and Mukhin, 2017). Our lemma
shows, consistent with the findings of Du et al. (2018b), that when κ > 0, LIBOR CIP will
fail. More novel, our theory implies that when κ > 0, xLIBOR
will, like λ$,∗
t
t , reflect foreign
investors’s demand for safe dollar assets. We verify this prediction in the data post-crisis.

This implies that covt m∗t+1 , ηt+1 = −µt,η + 0.5vart (ηt+1 ).
To derive an expression for the variance of the exchange rate, we start from the definition of log changes in exchange rates: vart (∆st+1 ) = vart (ηt+1 + m$t+1 − m∗t+1 ). This
can be simplified to:
vart (∆st+1 )

=

vart (m$t+1 ) + vart (m∗t+1 ) + vart (ηt+1 ) − 2covt (m$t+1 , m∗t+1 )

+

2covt (m$t+1 , ηt+1 ) − 2covt (m∗t+1 , ηt+1 ).

Plug in the covariance expressions above, we obtain
vart (∆st+1 ) = vart (m$t+1 ) + vart (m∗t+1 ) − 2covt (m$t+1 , m∗t+1 ) − vart (ηt+1 ) .

Long-run Riskless Rate

In the short run, the dollar exchange rate adjusts in response to changes in the convenience
yields. If real exchange rates are stationary, then there is no long-run currency adjustment.
The currency risk premium disappears from the exchange rate determination equation (see
Backus et al., 2018; Lustig et al., 2019). The spread between the real long-run returns earned
by foreign investors on U.S. Treasurys and domestic bonds reveals the (average) extra convenience yields earned by foreign investors when buying Treasurys:
λ$,∗ − λ∗,∗ = −(R$,∗ − R∗,∗ ) = 2%.

13

Using our model, we inferred from the Treasury basis and the response of the dollar exchange
rate that the extra convenience yield earned by foreign investors is around 2%. This implies
that in the long run real returns earned by foreign investors on Treasurys need to be 2%
lower than the returns on foreign bonds to maintain a stationary exchange rate. Our result is
qualitatively in line with the savings glut hypothesis (see, e.g., Caballero et al., 2008; Caballero
and Krishnamurthy, 2008) and the low r-star analysis (see Laubach and Williams, 2003, 2016;
Holston et al., 2017).
Admittedly, these are large numbers. We take a different, more direct approach to estimating this gap λ$,∗ −λ∗,∗ . We compute this return gap, as explained below, finding estimates
of λ$,∗ − λ∗,∗ between 1.57% and 1.89%. To compute the realized returns, we take the timing of foreign purchases of Treasurys into account. Foreigners buy Treasurys when they are
expensive.
The stylized model developed in the paper features a single maturity instrument. The
maturity of the bonds and the holding period was fixed at one year, mainly to simplify the
analysis, the equivalent of one period in the model. We want to compute the convenience yield
that foreign investors derive on their entire portfolio of U.S. Treasurys and T-Bills. Foreign
investors do not simply buy and hold Treasurys until maturity. To develop a precise measure
of the average convenience yield earned by foreign investors on all of their Treasury holdings,
we compute the effective return realized by foreign investors on all of their U.S. Treasury
purchases (R$,∗ ). This return is lower than what is suggested by average U.S. Treasury
yields. To compute the dollar-weighted return R$,∗ , we solve the following standard IRR
equation for R$,∗ :

where T denotes the holding period. The terminal cash flow AU MT is the market value of
the U.S. (foreign) investor’s Treasury holdings. We set AU M0$,∗ to zero.
We consider the returns earned by the stand-in foreign investor. This investor’s net
purchases of Treasurys in each quarter Net Purchases$,∗
equals the net purchases of U.S.
t
Treasurys by all foreign investors. We used the quarterly Flow of Funds data to measure
net purchases of Treasurys by foreign investors. We assume that this foreign investor is fully
invested in the Bloomberg Barclays Treasury Index. The Bloomberg Barclays US Treasury
Index measures US dollar-denominated, fixed-rate, nominal debt issued by the US Treasury.
Treasury bills are excluded by the maturity constraint, but are part of a separate Short
Treasury Index. To develop a benchmark, we also consider the returns earned by the standin U.S. investor buying Treasurys. Each quarter, this investor buys all of the Treasurys
issued by the U.S. Treasury less those Treasurys purchased by foreign investors. This index
is constructed to measure the returns of a stand-in U.S. investor who buys all marketable

The results are reported in Panel A of Table A.5. Foreign investors earn low effective returns on their Treasury holdings. The USD effective return realized by foreign investors
buying Treasurys over 39 years is only 5.27% p.a., well below the buy-and-hold return of
10.07 %.Hence, the yields, the buy-and-hold returns when the holding period is the maturity
of the bond, do not produce good estimates of the foreign investor’s returns. This number
should be compared to the effective return of 7.45% realized by U.S. investors, 2.18% higher
$,∗
than the foreign investor’s return. Foreign investors earn a real effective return (Rreal,P
PP )

of only 3.09% expressed in U.S. units of consumption. This is the relevant estimate of the
foreign real return provided that PPP holds in the long run. Foreign investors buy (sell)
Treasurys when U.S. Treasurys are expensive (cheap), i.e. when the convenience yields are
high (low). This number can be compared to the effective return of 4.83% realized by U.S.
investors, 1.74% higher than the foreign investor’s return.
In Panel B of Table A.5, we assume that the stand-in foreign investor is fully invested
in the WGBI World index ex-U.S to estimate the foreign investor’s realized return on foreign
∗,∗
local currency bonds (Rreal,∗
). The FTSE World Government Bond Index (WGBI) measures

the performance of fixed-rate, local currency, investment-grade sovereign bonds. The WGBI
is a widely used benchmark that currently includes sovereign debt from over 20 countries,
denominated in a variety of currencies, and has more than 30 years of history available. The
WGBI provides a broad benchmark for the global sovereign fixed income market. WGBI is
a market-cap-weighted index of local currency sovereign debt. The U.S. is excluded. The
stand-in foreign investor simply holds the ‘market for all foreign local currency debt’. Given
the home currency bias in local currency sovereign and corporate debt holdings, this seems
like a reasonable assumption (Maggiori et al., 2020b). The real buy-and-hold return realized
by foreign investors on foreign, local currency bonds is 4.66%.
If P.P.P. holds in the long run, then the difference between the real returns earned by
foreign investors on U.S. Treasurys and foreign bonds reveals the (average) extra convenience
yields earned by foreign investors when buying Treasurys. As a result, we can get an estimate
of the extra convenience yield on Treasurys by comparing dollar-weighted returns earned by
foreign investors on Treasurys to those earned on foreign bonds:
∗,∗
$,∗
$,∗
Rreal,P
− λ∗,∗ .
P P − Rreal,P P P = 4.66% − 3.09% = 1.57% = λ

Thus, from a different perspective, we estimate the convenience yield to be 1.57% per annum
based on the Flow of Funds data.

15

Next, we consider the TICS data provided by the U.S. Treasury. Table A.6 uses the
monthly TICS data instead of the quarterly Flow of Funds data. This allows us for more
precise calculations of the returns earned by foreign investors. In addition, we can also look
at private investor flows separately. In panel A, we consider total cross-border lows of U.S.
$,∗
Treasurys. Foreign investors earn a real effective return (Rreal,P
P P ) of only 3.24% (close to

3.09%). However, in Panel B, we exclude the foreign reserve purchases of central banks. The
effective real return decreases to 2.77%. The ‘private’ estimate of the extra foreign convenience
yield is 189 bps:
∗,∗
$,∗
$,∗
Rreal,P
− λ∗,∗ .
P P − Rreal,P P P = 4.66% − 2.77% = 1.89% = λ

These different approaches to estimating the foreign convenience yield all give numbers
in the same ballpark. This makes us more comfortable with our estimates.7

Appendix D.

Exchange Rate Model with
Sticky Expectations

To accommodate the evidence of time-series momentum in the dollar exchange rate, we
analyze a version of the model in which foreign exchange investors have sticky expectations:
we posit that these investors do not update their expectations each period, but, when they
do, they use the right model, as in Mankiw and Reis (2002). We assume that in any given
period, a fraction (1 − $) of investors update their information set each period. When they
update, they use rational expectations. We use Ft to denote the cross-sectional average of the
sticky information forecasts. Reis (2006) shows that the cross-sectional average forecast of a
P
j
variable xt h periods from now is simply given by: Ft xt+h = (1 − $) ∞
j=0 $ Et−j xt+h .
We posit the following autoregressive processes for the convenience yield earned by foreign
investors, the real interest rate difference it = rt$ − rt∗ and the (negative of the) risk premium
rpt = −(RPt∗ − V art (∆qt+1 )):
λ∗t+1

=

γ0 + γ1 λ∗t + ελ
t+1 ,

(D1)

it+1

=

ψ0 + ψ1 it + εit+1 ,

(D2)

rpt+1

=

δ0 + δ1 rpt + εrp
t+1 .

(D3)

Next we assume that the equilibrium exchange rate reflects the cross-sectional average across
all investors of their forecasts of the convenience yield earned by foreign investors, interest
rate differences, and risk premium components of equation (22). We show in the appendix
that:

1 − ψ1
1 − δ1

The first term measures the impact of the convenience yields earned by foreign investors
on the real exchange rate. The second term measures the interest rate differences. The U.S.
Treasury yield includes the effect of the U.S. investors’ convenience yields. The last term
comprises the currency risk premia.
To understand this expression, it is helpful to consider the case of rational expectations.

which is the equivalent of (12). The terms here correspond to the sum of future convenience
yields earned by foreign investors, the interest rate differentials, and the risk premia, evaluated
under the assumed AR(1) structure. When investors have sticky expectations ($ > 0), the log

18

of the real exchange rate adjust slowly to new information about convenience yields, interest
rates and risk premia, as captured by the lagged terms in the sum in (D4). The inertia in the
response to basis shocks is essential to match the time-series dynamics of the real exchange
rate.
We explicitly compute the impulse responses to innovations.

In the case of rational expectations $ = 0, the real exchange rate jumps upon impact and
then gradually depreciates. In this case, there is no momentum in realized returns.
To help us understand the return predictability produced by this model, we derive an
expression for the excess return expected by a rational investor who continuously updates her
expectations:
PROPOSITION 4: In the model with sticky expectations, the log excess return expected by
a rational foreign investor on a long position in U.S. Treasury bonds relative to the foreign
bond is:

When all agents have rational expectations $ = 0, this collapses to the standard expression:
Et [∆qt+1 ] + it = RPt∗ − λt .
An increase in λ decreases the expected excess return one-for-one. However, in the sticky
expectations case, returns will be predictable by all three state variables. Indeed, if $ is large
enough, an increase in λ initially increases expected excess returns.

We posit that the real dollar exchange rate is equal to the average valuation of the

Alternative Construction of
Treasury Basis

A.

KFW Bonds
Figure A.2 plots the basis for KfW bonds. KfW is a German issuer whose bonds are

backed by the German government, so that they are near default free. KfW issues bonds
in different currencies allowing us to compute the basis for the bonds of the same issuer,
i.e., holding safety fixed, in different currencies. We compute the basis for KfW bonds using
one-year yields on these bonds for Australia, Euro, UK, and Switzerland against the U.S..
The yield data is from Bloomberg and corresponds to a fitted yield at the one-year maturity
(one-year maturity bonds do not always exist). Clearly this measure is not as reliable as our
Treasury basis measure which only uses information from traded instruments. Figure A.2
plots the cross-country mean KfW basis and the Treasury basis (cross-country mean for the
same countries) over a sample with daily data from 2011Q2 to 2017Q2.

VAR Estimation Identification

Rescaling Bases and Interest Rate Differences in VAR

We estimate the

VAR system using quarterly data. In order to convert the 1-year Treasury basis to an equivalent 3-month Treasury basis, we scale the 1-year Treasury basis in the following way:
=
x3m
t

1−φ
,
· x12m
t
1 − φ4

where φ = 0.46 is the quarterly AR(1) coefficient on the 1-year basis.This AR(1) coefficient
is slightly different from the one calculated in Section A of the paper because in the VAR
system we drop 4 quarterly observations for missing real interest rate data. With this scaling,
a 1% increase in the 1-year basis at time t is spread into a

1−φ
1−φ4

· 1% = 0.56% increase in the

1-quarter basis at time t (or equivalently a 2.25% increase in the annualized 1-quarter basis),
an expected 0.26% increase in the 1-quarter basis at time t + 1, an expected 0.12% increase
in the 1-quarter basis at time t + 2, an expected 0.06% increase in the 1-quarter basis at time
t + 3. In this way, the expected increases in the 1-quarter basis from time t to t + 3 sum
up to 1%. Moreover, note that in an annual model, a 1% increase in the 1-year basis raises
the expected present-value of the convenience yield term in equation (22) by
our scaling, this shock raises the 1-quarter basis by

1−φ
1−φ4

increase in the present value of the convenience yield by

1
1−φ4

· 1%. By

· 1%, which also leads to the same

1−φ
1
1−φ4 1−φ

· 1% =

1
1−φ4

· 1%.

Similarly, we impose an AR(1) structure to the term structure of the interest rate differential. Under this structure, we scale the 1-year interest rate differential in the following
way:
i3m
=
t

1 − φi 12m
·i
,
1 − φ4i t

where φi = 0.85 is the quarterly AR(1) coefficient on the 1-year interest rate differential.
With this scaling, a 1% increase in the 1-year interest rate differential at time t is spread into
increases of 0.31%, 0.27%, 0.23% and 0.19% in the 1-quarter interest rate differential at time
t to t + 3.
A shock to the Treasury basis affects future Treasury basis, future interest rates, and
future risk premia. In order to estimate the β ∗ coefficient under the VAR model, we assume
that the response of the sum of expected risk premia to a Treasury basis shock is 0:
∆Et

RPt+τ

zt = Γ0 + Γ1 zt−1 + at .
We extract the orthogonalized basis shock from the Cholesky Decomposition:
var(at ) ≡ Ω = AA0 .
Define ãt = A−1 at , then var(ãt ) = I. The orthogonalized basis shock is defined as
Ae01 ãt . Then, we plug the impulse responses following the orthogonalized basis shock into

and obtain an estimate of β ∗ .

Ordering

Importantly, the results are not sensitive to switching the order of the basis

and interest rate differential, indicating that we can plausibly interpret the relation between
the basis and exchange rate causally: A shock to convenience yields moves both the basis
and the exchange rate. We say this because we have allowed for other known determinants
of the exchange rate, relative price levels and relative interest rates, and yet recover the same
relation between the basis and the exchange rate. Figure A.4 switches the ordering of the
interest rate difference and the basis in the VAR. The impulse responses to a basis shock
are nearly identical to those of Figure 2. The exchange rate falls a little under 3% over two
quarters and then gradually reverts over the subsequent 2 years. We find that the ordering
does not matter because the reduced form VAR innovations to the basis and the interest rate
difference are only weakly correlated. Finally, the ordering also does not affect the variance
decomposition results.

Robustness

Our robustness tests include (1) replacing the innovation to Treasury basis by the change
in Treasury basis, (2) re-running regressions in the subsample in which the Treasury basis is
small in magnitude, (3) in the predictability regression, changing the dependent variable from
the dollar’s excess return to its exchange rate movement, (4) using the quarterly average basis
instead of the end-of-quarter basis.

Explaining Variation in the Dollar when Treasury Basis is
Small
This section repeats the regressions in Table III in the sub-sample in which the U.S.

Treasury basis is above or equal to the 25th percentile (−30 basis points), which represent
the 75% of the data in which the Treasury basis is small in magnitude. We find that the U.S.
dollar’s exchange rate also comoves with the U.S. Treasury basis in these calm periods.

The dependent variable is the quarterly change in the log of the spot USD exchange rate

Forecasting Exchange Rate Movements using Treasury Basis
This section checks the predictability of nominal exchange rate movements instead of the

predictability of currency excess returns.

Table A.9. Forecasting Exchange Rate Movements in Panel Data
The dependent variable is the annualized change in the exchange rate (in logs) (4/k)∆st→t+k
on a long position in the dollar over k quarters. The independent variables are the average Treasury basis xT reas lagged by 1 quarter, and the nominal Treasury yield difference
$
(yt→t+k
− y ∗t→t+k ) with maturities of k quarters. Data is quarterly from 1988Q1 to 2017Q2.
We omit the constant, and report Newey-West standard errors with lags equal to the length
of the forecast horizon k. One, two and three stars denote statistical significance at the 10%,
5% and 1% level.

Market Microstructure
The FX markets in both spot and forward are large and liquid. Nevertheless, one may

want to know the extent to which the relation we uncover stems from micro-structure order
flow effects as in Evans and Lyons (2002) or Froot and Ramadorai (2005). Our theory does
not involve these types of effects, and to test our theory ideally our data would reflect the mid
of the bid and ask. By computing a quarterly average, we average out bid-ask bounce and
thus likely measure true mid-market prices. The relation we uncover is quite strong in this
averaged data (in fact it is stronger than the end-of-quarter data of Table III).8 The variation
reflected in the exchange rate is an order of magnitude larger than typical bid-ask spreads.
The standard-deviation of exchange rate changes in log points is 0.04, or 4%, which is well
above typical bid-ask spreads. The standard-deviation of Treasury basis changes is 0.00134
(13.4 basis points). The slope coefficient on the fitted regression line of −14.5 implies that a
one standard deviation change in the basis drives a 1.94% move in the exchange rate, which
is also an order of magnitude larger than bid-ask spreads.

Figure A.5.

Scatter plot of changes in the log exchange rate, averaged over a quarter,
against shocks to the quarterly average basis. Data is from 1988Q1 to 2017Q2. In red we plot
the fitted regression line. The R2 is 22.8% and the slope coefficient is −14.6 with a t-statistic
of 5.8.

rate against the change in the quarterly average basis.

Appendix H.

The U.S. vs U.K. Treasury Basis
and the USD/GBP Exchange
Rate

A.

Explaining Exchange Rate Movements
Figure A.6 plots the real exchange rate in units of GBP-per-USD (dashed line) against the

U.S./U.K. Treasury basis (full line). Both series are based on quarterly averaged data. We
use the real exchange rate because there are clear trends in the price levels of both countries
in the 1970s and early 1980s that we would expect to enter exchange rate determination. It
is evident that the two series are negatively correlated.
Table A.10 presents regressions analogous to that of Table III. We again see a strong
relationship between shocks to the basis and real exchange rate changes. The relation becomes
stronger later in the sample. We think this is in part because of measurement issues with the
basis during the 1970s. Note the spikey behavior of the basis in the 1970s in Figure A.6. In
column (5), where the sample starts in 1990, the coefficient of −11.67 is similar in magnitude
to our earlier estimates in Table III. The regression R2 is 28.4% which is a remarkably strong
fit.
Column (2) considers the innovation in the interest rate differential as a regressor. In
this sample in contrast to the cross-country sample, the interest rate differential has almost
no explanatory power for the exchange rate. As noted in the introduction, the prior evidence
linking interest rate changes and exchange rates is mixed and this is a clear example of this
pattern. The source of the difference is the time period: If we focused on the sample from
1990 onwards, the interest rate differential has explanatory power similar to the result in
Table III. Column (3) includes basis innovations and interest rate differential innovations.
The coefficients on the basis in column (3) are almost identical to those of column (1).

an R2 of 28.4%, whereas the 3-month basis has an R2 of 17.3%.

Currency Return Predictability
The return predictability results for the U.S./U.K. Treasury basis are quite similar to

those obtained on the shorter sample for the Panel. Table A.12 reports the results obtained
when forecasting the annualized excess returns on a long position in the dollar and a short
position in the pound. Panel A considers the results obtained on the entire sample. At the
horizon of 3 years, the slope coefficient is positive and statistically significant: 4.55. This is a
quantitatively significant response as well: a one-standard-deviation change in the U.S./U.K.
Treasury basis increases the annual return by 2.19% in the next 3 years. These regressors
jointly explain 20% of the variation in the 3-year excess returns. Panel B and C report results
for the pre-and post-crisis sample. The slope coefficients at the 3-year horizon vary from 4.47
in the pre-crisis sample to 9.14 in the post-crisis sample.
Table A.13 repeats the exercise using the exchange rate movements as the dependent
variables. The lag Treasury basis similarly predicts future exchange rate movements of the
dollar against the pound.

We report the estimated impulse responses for the U.S./U.K., too. The variables included

in the VAR are the Treasury basis, the interest rate differential and the log of the real exchange
rate (GBP-per-USD). The impulse response patterns are similar to those documented in Figure
2. An increase in the quarterly basis of 23 basis points leads to a real depreciation in the dollar
against the pound of about 1.3% over two quarters. Then, the effect gradually reverses out
over 3 years. We also report the impulse responses that obtain when we switch the ordering
of the interest rate differences and the basis. The responses to the basis shock again look
identical.9

9 Finally, we also adopted a local projection approach by projecting returns rx
t+k−1→t+k

on xt , rt − rt , qt . These yield impulse responses that are quite similar to the ones produced

by the Cholesky decomposition. The results are not reported.

Figure A.7. UK/U.S. Impulse Responses.
The red line plots the impulse response of of a one-standard-deviation orthogonalized shock to
the U.S./U.K. Treasury basis (top left panel), the real U.S./U.K. interest rate differential (top
right panel), and the log real GBP-per-USD spot exchange rate (bottom left panel), as well as
the quarterly excess return (bottom right panel). The units for the y-axis are in percentage
points. The grey areas indicates 95% confidenceh intervals. The
i VAR is estimated using a
sample from 1970Q1 to 2016Q2. The ordering is xt , rt$ − r∗t , qt .
