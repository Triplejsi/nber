free trade may not be optimal. Calvo takes the beliefs of the private

sector as given exogenously.

In this paper we first formalize Calvo's argument and discuss the optimal

policy for a government which seeks to maximize a representative household's
welfare.

The government's lack of credibility with the private sector is

represented

by a set of beliefs which the household holds

about the type of

government it faces. The households perceive the possibility of two types of
governments, one of which is the true one. We assume that there is a single
false type, which is believed to select a tariff with a positive probability.

The subjective probability

that the tariff is imposed in period 2, 7r, is the product of the probability
that the false government imposes the tariff, q, and the perceived probability
that the government is the false type, (1—X).

The true government's problem is to choose p, from the set {1,p) to
maximize the value of W, given the resultant expected utility maximizing
consumption behavior of the household. Equation (1) implies that if 71 exceeds

zero and free trade is selected in the first period, then consumption in
period 1 exceeds y and consumption in period 2 is less than y. That is, the
country borrows from abroad since the effective market rate of interest faced
by the household is less than the world rate' of interest.

If 71 is zero, then free trade in the first period (p1 =

1) achieves the

first-best allocation of consumption over periods, and if iT is unity then the

tariff achieves the first-best. In both these cases, the intertemporal terms
of trade for the household are identical to the foreign terms, (1+r), so that

there is no intertemporal distortion and consumption is the same in each

period. When

is between zero and one, there is a welfare loss due to the

intertemporal distortion created by the government's lack of credibility under
either free trade of the tariff.
In this model, any policy which brings the effective rate of interest for

households into equality with the world rate it' interest eliminates the
intertemporal distortion and achieves the first-best outcome. One such policy

importable between one arid p. However, our motivation is the problem of trade

liberalization when the private sector is skeptical about the government's

resolve to stay with the liberal regime.

If the private sector assesses

probability ir to a return to the old status quo and probability 1—U that
whatever liberalized regime is chosen will be maintained, then our set—up is a

simple representation of the optimizing government's problem.

Other policies which alleviate the intertemporal distortion are capital

The government chooses between free trade and the tariff to maximize
household utility, cognizant of how the household subsequently consumes and
saves. The value of social welfare in the case of free trade in the absence

This is derived from differentiation of

Since in this case (8) implies that V' (ci) > V1 (ca), dW/dli > 0, for all ir<1.

The values of social welfare are depicted in Figure 1 for both the free
trade and tariff cases. The value of iT, its, such that the two are equal is

greater than one-half. To see this, first note that since the rate of time

We now introduce learning by the private sector about the government's

trade or a tariff is optimal for the true government are straightforward. We
assume that the government knows the household's prior beliefs and that the
household recognizes that the true government chooses between the tariff

and

free trade optimally given the posteriors that will be formed by the
household.

If the parameters of the economy are such that a tariff is optimal for

the first period, then the prior probability that a tariff is imposed in

probability of a tariff in period 2 before the tariff in period 1 was revealed

q( 1—X,)). This is because the probability that the true government will
impose a tariff in the second period is zero, while the probability that the
false one will is q.

In other words, households know what the true government would do if it

were in power.

They know the parameters of the model, so they know if a

tariff is the optimal choice by the true government if it is in power.
this case it is optimal to put on a tariff.

In

Prior to observing the tariff

that is actually chosen by the true government, households have some prior
probability that the true government is in power. After it is revealed that a

tariff is imposed in period 1, they update their priors.

Consumption

decisions are made in period 1 after the tariff is revealed.

Because the

(true) government has full information, they meke their tariff choice in
period 1 knowing how consumers will update their priors.

If the parameters of the economy are such that free trade is optimal in
period 1, then the prior probability that free trade will be observed is
(1—q)(1—X0) + X0.

The posterior probability that the government is the true one, after having

For positive values of ir, tariff

reduction. In the one good case, there always exist possible priors for which
choosing the tariff in the first period is superior to free trade (e.g., 1(

When there

are two consumption goods, free trade may or may not be a

superior policy for all prior beliefs.
Adding a second consumable to our two-period

model is straightforward.

For simplicity, the country is coflipletely specialized in production of the

Therefore, we restrict our

if the tariff is superior to free trade for some possible beliefs, then
those values of lr for which it is the optimal policy all exceed one—half.

This follows from the one—good model, since the presence of the atemporal
welfare effect can only reduce the benefits of tariff imposition. Figures

beliefs,

If the tariff is a superior policy given initial prior

than a current account surplus occurs since

there is a perceived

positive probability that free trade will be chosen in a subsequent period.

As the prior probability that the government is the false type falls with
learning, the intertemporal distortion created by the tariff increases and the

current account surplus rises. Once free trade becomes optimal, the current

account goes into deficit because the private sector perceives a positive
probability of a tariff the next period.

With learning, this probability

declines, so that the current account deficit falls toward zero.

Since the

optimal saving path followed by the economy depends upon the initial prior
beliefs of the household, the steady-state wealth and consumption also depends
upon the initial priors.

When a government is

but the consumers do not believe that is the government's goal, a

distortion is introduced inth the economy.

In the models we have examined,

the misperception is about future tariff policy.

The incredulity of

households creates an intertemporal distortion.

is

not available to the government. As a second-best policy it

may be desirable to impose a tariff, if the atemporal distortion is smaller
than the intertemporal distortion.

The optimizing government cannot reach the first-best solution under the

constraints we have postulated. Therefore, even when it implements the best
policy among the ones it has at its disposal, a distortion remains. However,
we have shown that the mere act of choosing policy optimally over time reduces

the size of the externality. This is true even if the optimal policy is to
choose a tariff currently. By acting optimally, the government establishes
credibility, A government cannot achieve credibility instantaneously —-

it

must do so over time by choosing the policy which is best for the public. The

public will begin to recognize the benificence of the government, even if it

is imposing a tariff, if that tariff is the best choice the government can
make.

(The irony

is that the skepticism cf

the public

is

what forces the

to choose a tariff, and is what keeps the economy away from an

unconstrained Pareto optimum.)

The presence of learning generally weakens the case for a tariff as a
policy to deal with the interteniporal distortion caused by household's
incredulity. First, the public must
good intentions of the government (as

for it

initially be more skeptical about the
compared to the case without learning)

to be optimal to impose a tariff. Second, over time with learning it

is inevitable that free trade becomes the best policy.
