We study immigrant entrepreneurship in 2007 and 2012 using the Survey of Business Owners.
First-generation immigrants create about 25% of new firms in America, but this share exceeds
40% in some states. Immigrant-owned firms tend to create fewer jobs than native-owned firms,
have comparable pay levels, offer fewer benefits, and engage more in international activities.
Immigrant-founded firms in high-tech sectors more closely resemble native-founded firms than in
low-tech sectors. Prominent tech clusters display quite pronounced shares of immigrant
entrepreneurs, with stronger high-tech immigrant entrepreneurs being especially present. Secondgeneration immigrants tend to show intermediate firm traits indicative of business assimilation.

ABSTRACT
We study immigrant entrepreneurship and firm ownership in 2007 and 2012 using the Survey of
Business Owners (SBO). The survival and growth of immigrant-owned businesses over time
relative to native-founded companies is evaluated by linking the 2007 SBO to the Longitudinal
Business Database (LBD). We quantify the dependency of the United States as a whole, as well
as individual states, on the contributions of immigrant entrepreneurs in terms of firm formation
and job creation. We describe differences in the types of businesses started by immigrants and the
quality of jobs created by their firms. First-generation immigrants create about 25% of new firms
in the United States, but this share exceeds 40% in some states. In addition, Asian and Hispanic
second-generation immigrants start about 6% of new firms. Immigrant-owned firms, on average,
create fewer jobs than native-owned firms, but much of this is explained by the industry and
geographic location of the firms. Immigrant-owned firms pay comparable wages, conditional on
firm traits, to native-owned firms, but are less likely to offer benefits.

Introduction

Immigrant entrepreneurship plays an important role in the American economy. Immigrants
start about 25% of all U.S. …rms in the Survey of Business Owners data during 2008-2012, and
this share rises to above 40% in states like California and New York. These immigrant-founded
…rms provide jobs and innovations, impacting the lives of natives. Immigrant entrepreneurs
frequently show up in popular press business narratives, legislation and lobbying discussions,
and the founding histories of many prominent …rms. Among Fortune 500 companies, about
40% were founded by …rst- or second-generation immigrants (Partnership for a New American
Economy 2011).
The prominence of immigrant entrepreneurs, aided by expanding economic data sets for
research, has yielded a burgeoning academic literature. Many early studies establish that
immigrants are more likely to enter self-employment and other forms of entrepreneurship than
natives.1 A few recent studies also identify some important properties of these …rms, such
as Wang and Liu (2005) showing that U.S. …rms with immigrant owners are more likely to
export goods and services and have operations abroad. Brown et al. (2018) document a
greater patenting/innovation rate for immigrant-founded …rms.2 Yet, this comparison between
immigrant- and native-founded …rms remains incomplete, and relatively little is known about
the broader impacts of immigrant entrepreneurs in terms of job creation and economic growth.3
Given that over a quarter a new …rm births are connected to immigrant entrepreneurs— a
share that is continually rising— an accurate characterization of these inputs is important for
enhanced business and economic analysis.
Such a depiction would be incomplete without a consideration of the vast heterogeneity in
immigrant entrepreneurship, which parallels in many ways the diversity of entrepreneurship
more broadly. Immigrant entrepreneurs range from small “mom and pop” stores in low-tech
1

Examples include Borjas (1986), Lofstrom (2002), Clark and Drinkwater (2000, 2006), Fairlie and Meyer
(2003), Schuetze and Antecol (2007), Fairlie et al. (2010), Lofstrom et al. (2014), Kerr and Kerr (2017), and
Brown et al. (2018). Examples of studies for high-tech immigrant entrepreneurship include Saxenian (1999,
2002), Anderson and Platzer (2006), Monti et al. (2007), Wadhwa et al. (2007), and Hart and Acs (2011).
2
Brown et al. (2018) consider the 2007 SBO and 2014 Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs. Their important
study …nds that immigrant entrepreneurs have distinct motivations for starting a business as compared to
natives, and immigrant entrepreneurs are more likely to engage in R&D and innovation. This is especially true
among college-educated founders.
3
Immigrant scientists and engineers have received closer study. For example, Hunt and Gauthier-Loiselle
(2010), Kerr and Lincoln (2010), Hunt (2011), Kerr et al. (2015a,b), Peri et al. (2015), and Breschi et al.
(2017). Kerr (2017) provides a review.

settings to high-tech start-ups in top clusters like Silicon Valley. These …rms are likely to
look quite di¤erent from each other, and they may also be more or less similar to their closest
native peers. We need a better understanding of the range of industries in‡uenced by immigrant
entrepreneurs and their impact on U.S. economic regions as diverse as Montana and Florida.
This study quanti…es many of these features using a novel data platform— the Survey of
Business Owners (SBO) for 2007 and 2012, combined with the Longitudinal Business Database
(LBD) for 2007-2011. The SBO allows us to measure the number and quality of jobs created by
immigrant entrepreneurs, and we can separate out …rms in high-tech vs. low-tech industries.
The SBO information spans company payroll per employee, usage of full-time vs. temporary
workers, and the provision of various employee bene…ts such as health insurance and paid time
o¤. We also examine di¤erences between native- and immigrant-founded …rms in terms of their
international activities and start-up and expansion …nancing.
To preview some of our results, dependency on immigrant founders varies substantially
across regions in America, from less than 5% in Idaho and North Dakota to more than 40%
in “gateway” states like California. Immigrant-founded …rms tend to have fewer employees
than native-founded …rms, but they have higher labor productivity (receipts per employee),
are more likely to survive to 2011, and grow employment at a slightly faster pace. The jobs created by immigrant-founded …rms provide comparable wages, but these …rms o¤er signi…cantly
fewer bene…ts like healthcare or 401k plans. Re‡ecting the early literature, immigrant-founded
…rms engage in more extensive international activities. Regression analyses show that these
di¤erences are partly explained by industries in which immigrant-founded startups operate,
but a gap persists even with a very stringent set of control variables. High-tech …rms founded
by immigrants tend to look more like their native peers than those in low-tech industries,
but usually the results are of similar qualitative direction regardless of sector. There are also
di¤erences by owner ethnicity, but relatively fewer di¤erences by owner education level.
The depth of the survey also allows us to consider entrepreneurship inside vs. outside
of prominent tech clusters. We …nd that immigrant-founded companies account for more
than 40% of high-tech startups in leading clusters. As their traits tend to resemble those
of native-founded companies in these clusters, most of the impact appears to come through
sheer quantity of immigrant entrepreneurs agglomerating in key hubs. Finally, we compare the
activity of …rst- generation immigrants to that of second-generation immigrants to measure

3

whether the …rms founded by U.S.-born entrepreneurs with foreign-born parents more closely
resemble the companies started by native entrepreneurs.
The new …rms that we study have an important impact, as young …rms account for almost
all of the net job growth in America (Haltiwanger et al. 2013). First-generation immigrants
found or co-found 23.7% and 26.0% of these new …rms in 2007 and 2012, respectively. As
entering employment sizes in recent cohorts are mostly similar for immigrants and natives,
immigrant entrepreneurs have accounted for a similar share of new jobs in young companies in
both surveys. Applying these shares to overall U.S. private-sector employment in new …rms as
captured by the Business Dynamics Survey would estimate job provision by young immigrantowned …rms of 3-4 million workers. Further incorporating second-generation immigrants would
raise the estimates to 4-5 million workers. While these calculations are only approximate, they
give a sense to the ongoing contribution to the U.S. economy of immigrant entrepreneurship.
These results inform the potential economic impact of policy reforms. In 2019, the United
States has the EB-5 visa that targets wealthy immigrants capable of investing a million dollars
into a U.S.-based business, but the country lacks a program that facilitates other aspiring
migrant entrepreneurs (or graduating students from U.S. schools who wish to create a …rm vs.
entering paid employment).4 Consequently, the vast majority of immigrant entrepreneurs enter
the United States through the broad migration routes of family-based visas or employmentsponsored visas (with entrepreneurship becoming possible once a green card is obtained). With
this di¤use and indirect origin, the outcomes of immigrant entrepreneurship must be observed
in the economy vs. inferred from rules or policy requirements.5
The rest of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on immigrant
entrepreneurship and presents theories as to why immigrants choose to enter entrepreneurship.
Section 3 describes the SBO data platform and provides descriptive tabulation. Section 4 uses

By comparison, Canada, France and the U.K. have distinct visas for foreign entrepreneurs with various
incentives aimed at attracting more start-ups. The French Tech Ticket program was initiated in 2016, Canada’s
start-up visa scheme in 2013, and the UK’s Entrepreneur Visa in 2008. Other examples include Chile, Cyprus,
Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, Spain, and Taiwan. President
Obama sought to increase access to entrepreneur visas through actions like the International Entrepreneur
Rule, but the Trump administration has paused these e¤orts inde…nitely. Kerr (2019) describes e¤orts to
attract global talent in America and other countries. Many U.S. cities seek to attract immigrant entrepreneurs
and their economic stimulus, such as the Competition THRIVE program in New York City, the O¢ ce of New
Americans in Chicago, the International Institute of St. Louis, and the Welcoming Cities initiatives in places
such as Pittsburgh.

Theoretical and Conceptual Background

A growing body of work documents the higher rate at which immigrants enter entrepreneurship
in America than natives (Fairlie 2012). This section explores some of the key …ndings from
this literature and how theoretically we anticipate immigrant entrepreneurship in high-tech
vs. low-tech industries to be di¤erent. As a …rst step, two candidate explanations for high
rates of immigrant entrepreneurship can be dismissed. Most important, the phenomenon is
broad-based in America and not simply due to immigrants from one source country or region
being particularly entrepreneurial. Fairlie and Lofstrom (2013) use the 2007-2011 Current
Population Survey (CPS) and con…rm, among other things, that immigrant entrepreneurship
is pervasive across ethnic groups. Consequently, as immigration to America is very diverse
across education levels, industries, and regions, we anticipate substantial heterogeneity in the
entrepreneurial population.
Second, immigrant entrepreneurship is not just an American phenomenon. The higher
propensity of immigrants towards creating new …rms is observed in other immigrant-receiving
countries (OECD 2010). Unfortunately, the data on immigrant entrepreneurship globally are
sparse and far from systematic or comparable over nations. However, the existing data are
consistent in observing a higher rate of entrepreneurship among immigrants. The Centre for
Entrepreneurs (2014) shows that over 17% of U.K. immigrants start a …rm, compared to 10%
of natives. For Canada, 19.6% of immigrants become self-employed (5.3% own a …rm), whereas
the comparable numbers are 16.1% and 4.8% for natives (Green et al. 2016). For Australia,
the overall rate of self-employment is about 12%, with immigrants more likely to enter selfemployment than natives (Atalay et al. 2014).6
6
The Centre for Entrepreneurs (2014) calculates that immigrants start 14% of all U.K. …rms, with particular
concentration around London. Comparable statistics for Canada and Australia are not possible, but Momani
(2016) reports that 24% of small- and medium-sized enterprise owners in Canada are immigrants.

2.1

Root Factors for Immigrant Entrepreneurship

While our study focuses on the United States, these common global patterns to immigrant
entrepreneurship suggest that the root factors likely overlap across countries. We draw from the
literature the four factors outlined next, which contribute directly and interact with each other.
Some of these root factors act as a positive and pulling force for immigrant entrepreneurship,
emphasizing the personality traits of immigrants, group-level bene…ts from joint selection into
entrepreneurship, and so on. Other factors are darker and point to a push of immigrants into
self employment due to weak opportunities for regular employment, discrimination, and similar
challenges.
Entrepreneurial Personality: A substantial literature, reviewed by Åstebro et al. (2014)
and Kerr, Kerr and Xu (2018), explores the degree to which entrepreneurs have a prototypical
personality. On many dimensions of personality, such as the classic Big-5 personality traits, the
literature …nds very limited di¤erence between entrepreneurs and wage workers. The bigger
di¤erences instead emerge around factors such as the willingness or ability to tolerate risk and
uncertainty, self-e¢ cacy (the belief in one’s ability to complete tasks and …ll roles), internal
locus of control (the belief that one’s decisions control the outcomes of life vs. external factors),
and the need for achievement. The required tolerance for risk has been closely studied (e.g.,
Kihlstrom and La¤ont 1979, Hvide and Panos 2014) and Kerr, Kerr, and Dalton (2019) …nd
survey and experimental evidence consistent with these personality factors.
There may be a conceptual connection of these personality traits to immigration. Leaving
one’s home and moving abroad frequently involves uncertainty and risk, and migrants must
often believe in themselves and their power to create a life in their new home. The choice to
migrate may select on individuals with these traits, and the duration within the new home
may further engender them. For example, a young migrant who successfully gets started in
America may endogenously acquire a greater tolerance for risk and belief in her capabilities to
produce the outcomes she desires. While the empirical veri…cation of these linkages remains
incomplete, the act of migration may capture a pool of individuals with personalities more
aligned to opening up a business.
Conditional on being an entrepreneur (which will be true throughout our empirical work),
we conjecture that these personality forces will have relatively limited di¤erences between hightech and low-tech industries. One can easily imagine the poorest of migrants being the most
6

selected on these dimensions and overcoming the most adversities (per the classic American
dream). Broader population rates of entrepreneurship by immigrant group could be a¤ected
but are beyond this study’s data scope.
Opportunity-Based Migration: A feature related to the selection to migrate is the
opportunity-based nature of much of immigration. While some migration is sadly forced (e.g.,
refugees), much of immigration occurs when individuals seek opportunities (and much of the
missing bene…ts of migration happen when these intentions are blocked, such as Clemens 2011).
This occurs within regions (e.g., low-skilled migration from India to work in Gulf States) and
on global scales (e.g., ‡ocking of bankers to leading …nancial centers). The United States
has long been a favored destination for prospective entrepreneurs due to its open and mostly
competitive markets, its complementary service providers (such as …nancing), and its contentsized product markets and customer bases. For many entrepreneurial immigrants, it is the
dream destination.
While we believe this factor promotes immigrant entrepreneurship across the board, the
impact for high-tech sectors is likely to be more pronounced. America provides prospective
high-tech entrepreneurs access to the scienti…c frontier, the world’s most vibrant talent clusters, deep venture capital markets, and so forth. Akcigit, Baslandze, and Stantcheva (2016)
demonstrate that the most productive immigrant inventors are the most sensitive to higher tax
rates, and Kerr (2010) documents how immigrants are particularly fast to migrate to locations
experiencing breakthrough inventions. These patterns suggest that high-tech entrepreneurs
have the most to gain from migration to America vs. other potential destinations.7
Weaker Labor Market Prospects: Entrepreneurship does not happen at equal rates
across the education and skill distribution. First, at a macro level, entrepreneurship exhibits
a U-shaped pattern with respect to the full distribution of skills, disproportionately occurring
at the upper and lower tails of the distribution (Poschke 2013; Levine and Rubinstein 2017).
Åstebro, Chen and Thompson (2011) colorfully describe these tails as “stars” and “mis…ts.”
Second, Hegde and Tumlinson (2018) provide provocative evidence that within each education
rank (grade by grade), individuals are more likely to start their own business if they have high
skill levels and abilities compared to others with the same credentials.
7

This potential for opportunity-based migration is strong enough to a¤ect early education choices made in
sending countries (e.g., Chand and Clemens 2008; Gibson and McKenzie 2011). Akee et al. (2013) show that
migrants with a history of entrepreneurship in their home country are more likely to be entrepreneurs in their
new nation.

7

Both of these patterns connect into immigrant entrepreneurship. At the macro level, immigrants are more prevalent at the lower and higher ends of the education distribution than
natives in America. Among those aged 18 and older, immigrants are 20% more likely than
natives to have ended their education with a high school diploma or less, but they are also
40% more likely than natives to have earned a doctorate or equivalent degree (American Community Survey 2012). Immigration at the lower end of the education distribution is connected
to both employment-based migration for low-skilled work (e.g., agricultural visas) and familybased migration; these groups arrive disproportionately from Central and Latin America and
connect in part to unauthorized in‡ows. Immigration at the upper end of the education ladder
connects more to student and skilled worker visas.
At a more micro level, immigrants can be pushed towards entrepreneurship due to a lack
of labor market opportunities commensurate with their skill set. Many immigrants experience downward mobility and underemployment when they …rst arrive in a destination country.
This is often due to an under-recognition of education and experience gained in their home
country (e.g., Friedberg 2000; Li 2001; Batalova, Fix and Creticos 2008), as it is more di¢ cult
for employers to assess foreign school quality or validate credentials compared to a domestic
candidate. For some migrants, this temporary setback is recti…ed by gaining additional experience and/or education after migration (e.g., Creese and Weibe 2012), but others look to
entrepreneurship as an attractive alternative.
Given the pervasive nature of this factor, it is not theoretically clear if it should impact hightech or low-tech industries more. The challenges presented by discrimination (e.g., Oreopoulos
2011; Edo, Jacquemet, and Yannelis 2013) or a lack of employment authorization may be
more acute in low-tech work. The founding entrepreneur may also decide to start a business
because of comparative access to underemployed or undocumented individuals, potentially
gaining lower labor costs compared to competitors.
For high-tech industries, it is likely that the pathways to wage work are stronger for immigrants and more consistent, due to the greater transportability of technical skills and the
deeper pool of the labor markets. According to 2012 ACS statistics, immigrants are twice as
likely as natives to be employed in a STEM occupation, and thus employers will have greater
incentives to recruit e¤ectively in these markets. On the other hand, small proportionate differences in wage versus entrepreneurial outcomes become much larger as one gets to the highest

8

end of the skill distribution.
Co-Ethnic Social Bond: Connected to the above factors, immigrant entrepreneurs display a remarkable concentration— varying by ethnic group— in terms of the sectors in which
they operate. Prominent low-tech examples include Vietnamese nail care salons, Korean dry
cleaners, Gujarti Indian motels, and Punjabi Indian convenience stores. In the pre-Uber days,
immigrant groups often drove most of the taxis in a city, with the particular ethnic group varying by city. Studies of this entrepreneurial concentration highlight the bene…ts obtained by
group specialization and shared knowledge when strong social networks undergird the ethnic
community, and this concentration becomes a natural pathway to employment and potential
entrepreneurship for new arrivals.8
There is similar evidence in advanced high-tech sectors of this specialization and co-ethnic
connection, albeit likely less pronounced. Hegde and Tumlinson (2014) document that venture
investors are more likely to invest in a …rm run by someone of the same ethnic background,
and Gompers, Mukharlyamov, and Xuan (2016) document how venture inventors also co-invest
with each other along ethnic lines. These co-ethnic connections are not necessarily e¢ cient
choices, as investors may be less careful for example, but speak again to the group-based
concentration.
Consistent with this concentration, we later document in the SBO data that roughly half of
immigrant-owned startups are in three sectors: accommodation and food services, retail trade,
and professional and technical services. Native-owned …rms are less concentrated. These group
based factors appear strongest among low-tech services and trade segments, compared to the
high-tech sector, due to the greater integration of high-tech …rms in local markets.

2.2

Combining Features and De…ning Business Traits

Our discussion highlights how all four of these root factors contribute to immigrant entrepreneurship, but likely to varying degrees for high-tech vs. low-tech industries. We conjecture that
immigrant founders of high-tech …rms are more likely to select into entrepreneurship due to
positive pull factors, especially opportunity-based migration. Push factors like discrimination
or weak labor market prospects are likely to be less important, although early stories of Silicon
Valley immigrant entrepreneurs do mention perceptions of glass ceilings on advancement at
8

For example, Kalnins and Chung (2006), Roth et al. (2012), Patel and Vella (2013), Andersson et al. (2014),
Kerr and Mandor¤ (2015), and Battisti et al. (2016).

9

local tech incumbents.
Consequently, it is likely that high-tech immigrant entrepreneurs will be stronger and building better …rms overall than their fellow migrants in low-tech settings. Some early con…rmation
of this selection e¤ect is evident in the 2012 SBO data, where immigrant high-tech founders
draw disproportionately from the highest education groups. Hunt (2011) also observes that the
highest earning, most innovative, and most entrepreneurial immigrants arrived in the United
States through temporary work or education visas, both which require a high level of education. These high-skilled individuals are quite mobile and often select locations where they will
have the most opportunities. Indeed, we further conjecture that the strongest of high-tech
immigrant entrepreneurs will be found in innovation clusters where …rms compete in dynamic
markets and diversity rates are high.9 In these competitive clusters, we further anticipate that
the jobs created will need to match to a large degree what is being o¤ered (wages and bene…ts)
by comparable native-founded …rms.
Immigrant founders in low-tech sectors are harder to predict. These founders are more
likely to have migrated for non-work reasons and to have selected entrepreneurship as a way
to build work opportunities for their families and/or communities. These …rms will be similar
to most small businesses in that few are seeking to disrupt a market or invent a new product or model (Hurst and Pugsley 2011). The 2012 SBO con…rms that low-tech immigrant
founders are disproportionately selected from low education groups. In this environment, we
expect greater di¤erences can emerge in terms of employment conditions and pay compared
to comparable native-founded …rms. This is especially true for family …rms or …rms who hire
other immigrants, connected to lower worker productivity (e.g., learning the language), lack
of competing employment o¤ers, or similar.
Finally, the SBO data collect information on the global activities of …rms. An extensive
literature connects migration to trade.10 Global engagement could be focused on the exchange
of ethnic goods and services, possibly linked to overseas diaspora communities, in ways that extend the product set of their host country. Migrants may also use their connections and global
understanding to boost overseas sales of general products without ethnic speci…c components.
9

For example, Saxenian (1996, 2000), Florida (2005), Fallick, Fleischman, and Rebitzer (2006), and Kerr
(2019).
10
Examples include Gould (1994), Head and Ries (1998), Rauch (2001), Rauch and Trindade (2002), Hatzigeorgiou and Lodefalk (2011), Bahar and Rapoport (2018), and Kerr (2018). Docquier and Rapoport (2012)
provide a broader review.

10

We anticipate both low- and high-tech immigrant entrepreneurs to have a comparative advantage towards international engagement than their native peers. We further anticipate the
bene…ts of this advantage to be greater with high-tech industries given the anecdotal and
empirical accounts of global ethnic networks within high-tech industries (e.g., Saxenian 2002,
Kerr 2008) and the typically greater market span for these products.
While our conceptual background has treated immigrant and native entrepreneurs as separate, there will be many …rms with mixed founding teams. One starting hypothesis is that
mixed teams would split the di¤erence between pure immigrant and native founding teams,
but one might also believe that the presence of one immigrant founder is enough to tilt characteristics (e.g., overseas linkages to promote engagement). It is also important to recognize that,
by de…nition, mixed …rms have more than one founder and so tend to be larger. Moreover,
they may be less likely to occur in family-based settings or in smaller, rural locations. Thus,
given this ambiguity, we will model them separately below in our empirical work. Moreover,
we will consider some patterns for second-generation or later immigrant groups, where it is
likely a partial assimilation has occurred (e.g., Masurel and Nijkamp 2004; Ibrahim and Galt
2011).

Data and Descriptive Tabulations

We use the restricted-access Survey of Business Owners (SBO) data housed in the Federal
Statistical Research Data Centers (RDC). We employ the 2007 and 2012 SBOs and merge
them with other Census Bureau data sources, including the Longitudinal Business Database
(LBD). These data provide a rich and detailed platform to study immigrant entrepreneurship
over across industries and geographies.11

3.1

SBO 2007 and 2012 Data

The raw SBO …les contain many types of …rms, ranging from self-employed individuals who
do not hire employees to small and large employer …rms, some of which are publicly held.
Our SBO analysis considers employer …rms given our focus on understanding the quantity
11
Studies using the SBO micro data include those considering ethnic and minority entrepreneurs (e.g., Fairlie
and Robb 2008, 2009; Fairlie 2012; Echeverri-Carroll and Kellison 2012; Gramlich and Perrin 2013; Mora and
Davila 2014), job creation by owner gender (Conroy and Weiler 2016), and sources of start-up capital (e.g.,
Mencken and Tolbert 2016; Kerr et al. 2018). The Fiscal Policy Institute also published a 2012 report using
the 2007 SBO regarding immigrant and native business owners.

11

and types of jobs created, rather than the self-employment patterns previously discussed in
the literature.12 We also exclude publicly owned …rms from the sample, as it is impossible to
accurately separate them into the immigrant- versus native-owned categories.
In 2007, our baseline sample of private employer …rms includes 950 thousand companies. We
exclude 1.4 million records for publicly owned …rms and …rms with no identi…able owner (e.g.,
estates, trusts, cooperatives, clubs, tribal entities) and 10.4 million records for self-employed
incorporated non-employers. In 2012, our baseline sample of private employer …rms includes
300 thousand companies. This 2012 sample comes after the exclusion of 224 thousand records
for publicly owned companies and …rms with no identi…able owner and 8.3 million records for
self-employed individuals. The core sample is smaller in 2012 due to the introduction of two
separate versions of the SBO survey instrument, one of which lacks detailed questions about
the owners of the …rm. This change does not impact our work as tabulation weights allow for
population-based estimates.
We de…ne new …rms to be those entering in the …ve years prior to each survey. This
segment captures the role of immigrants in recent entrepreneurial activity, and we use the
term “startups”interchangeably. The number of new …rm records that underlie the upcoming
analyses is 139 thousand in 2007 and 48 thousand in 2012 (approximately 15% and 16% of
the included SBO …rms in 2007 and 2012, respectively). We track the new …rms that enter
prior to the 2007 SBO over time in the LBD, which provides annual employment and payroll
information. This link a¤ords measurement of the survival and growth patterns of these young
…rms during the critical early years of their operations.
The SBO records information on each owner of the …rm, and we consider these owners to
be the founders or entrepreneurs of the new …rms that we study, although in a small share of
cases the ownership of the …rm will have changed hands by the time of the SBO survey. In
some tabulations, we mirror the literature by classifying a …rm as immigrant-owned if any of
the …rm’s owners is an immigrant. In our regression analyses, we typically parse into a separate
category the …rms with mixed immigrant and native ownership teams to allow for exclusively
immigrant-owned companies to be compared to exclusively native-owned companies.
We de…ne the high-tech industry based on the company NAICS code being in the list of

an NAICS code listed as a patent-intensive industry in Doms et al. (2012).13 The SBO records
data on around 97 thousand high-tech …rms in 2007 and 48 thousand in 2012 (approximately
15% and 18% of the included SBO …rms in 2007 and 2012, respectively). Among new …rms,
high-tech …rms account for 16 thousand in 2007 and 8 thousand in 2012, or a 12% and 16%
share respectively. Of course, a …rm can be technologically sophisticated in a low-tech industry,
and vice versa. Despite the imperfections of industry-based divisions, the ability to explore
entrepreneurship in high-tech settings is a powerful addition to the literature.
We also investigate patterns for Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), following previous
research on the high concentration of high-tech …rms (e.g., Liu, Painter, and Wang 2014).
High-tech MSAs are de…ned as the San Francisco Bay area, inclusive of Silicon Valley and San
Jose, and the remaining top ten MSAs for housing high-tech …rms using combined 2007 and
2012 SBOs: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, and
Washington D.C.
Throughout this paper, Census Bureau disclosure requires observation counts be rounded,
and all reported numbers are likewise rounded to four signi…cant digits. We use the SBO
tabulation weights in summary tables, and the noise-infused employment, payroll and receipt
outcomes in 2007 (and for variables built upon those metrics).

SBO Descriptive Analysis

Tables 1a-c describe the SBO sample for new …rms, with parallel tabulations for all …rms being
found in Appendix Tables A1a-c. In Table 1a, 26% of new …rms formed in 2012 have an immigrant founder, which is comparable to prior work and other data approaches.14 Immigrantowned …rms have fewer employees but slightly higher receipts per employee.15 Receipts include
the total revenue and business done by domestic establishments of the …rm, excluding foreign
operations; values are reported in thousands of nominal dollars. Immigrant-owned …rms also

High-tech industries include NAICS 333, 335, 1131-2, 2111, 2211, 3241, 3251-6, 3259, 3341-6, 3364, 3369,

and 8112.
14
Kerr and Kerr (2017) measure immigrant entrepreneurship through the Longitudinal Employer Household
Dynamics (LEHD) database, a very large administrative dataset collected by the Census Bureau. Relative to
the SBO, these data cover a much greater number of establishments, but the …rm and founder details in the SBO
are much richer. Kerr and Kerr (2017) …nd that the share of immigrant founders steadily increased between
1995 and 2008, reaching 25% by 2008.

Employment, payroll and sales receipts variables are not collected by the SBO but instead merged by the
Census Bureau from the economic censuses conducted in parallel to the SBO.

pay lower wages (measured as payroll divided by employment), with an 12% di¤erential evident
in 2012, and begin with more start-up capital.
Looking at the traits of entrepreneurs, female ownership is similar across both …rm groups.
Immigrant entrepreneurs tend to be younger and are more likely to combine owners of several
ages, perhaps indicative of a greater prevalence of family businesses. Education levels are
broadly comparable between immigrants and natives. Native-only …rms are more likely to
have single owners, while …rms with immigrant or mixed owners are more likely to report three
or more owners.
In addition to paying lower wages, immigrant-owned …rms are less likely to o¤er employee
bene…ts such as health insurance, retirement bene…ts, and paid leave. These di¤erences across
owner types are among the starkest in the SBO data and perhaps indicate less attractive
employment. (The provision of these bene…ts declined among all start-ups between 2007 and
2012, which we have con…rmed in other data sources like the Current Population Survey.)
Immigrant-owned …rms are comparable to native-owned …rms in terms of hiring temporary
versus full-time workers. Nationally, temporary workers account for just over 2% of private
sector jobs (Economics and Statistics Administration, 2015). Temporary employment includes
workers from temporary agencies, day laborers, and leased employees; part-time workers are
a separate category. Finally, immigrant-owned …rms show a much higher rate of international
activity as measured by exporting, outsourcing, and maintaining overseas operations.
Table 1b separates purely immigrant-owned start-ups from mixed teams, with Appendix
Table A1b providing comparable breakouts for all …rms. Immigrant-only teams accounted
for 19% and 22% of new …rms in 2007 and 2012, while mixed teams accounted for 5% and
4%, respectively. Start-ups with mixed ownership tend to be larger and begin with more
capital, but they are comparable for wages and receipts per employee. Interestingly, the most
common number of owners is two for mixed teams, as compared to only one among immigrantand native-only …rms. The greater number of owners allows for mixed teams to show more
ownership diversity for age, education, and gender. With respect to bene…ts, mixed-owner
…rms are more likely to o¤er health insurance and paid leave, but not retirement bene…ts.
Related to hiring more employees, mixed-owner …rms are more likely than native-only …rms
to hire both temporary and full-time workers. Lastly, mixed-owner …rms report international
operations at a higher rate than any other …rm group, including immigrant-only …rms.

14

Table 1c considers new …rms in high-tech vs. low-tech industries. Immigrant-owned startups comprised 29% and 26% of high- and low-tech entry in 2012, respectively. This is similar
to 2007, but rates among high-tech …rms rose faster (the proportions were 25% and 24%, respectively). Among immigrant-owned …rms, high-tech …rms tend to hire fewer employees and
pay almost double the wages of immigrant-owned …rms in low-tech settings. Start-up capital
amounts are consistently lower among high-tech …rms, but higher for immigrant-owned …rms
among both groups.
High-tech …rms often have larger founding teams, despite their lower employment, but
are less likely to include women. High-tech founders are also more concentrated in higher
levels of education. High-tech …rms are substantially more likely to o¤er bene…ts and engage
in international activities. The earlier di¤erences among immigrant- and native-owned …rms
remains among both industry groups in regards to international operations; di¤erences in
employer-provided bene…ts remain for low-tech …rms but are much smaller for high-tech …rms.
As noted earlier, this could be due to the prevalence of high-tech …rms in more competitive
markets for employees.

3.3

Industry, Financing and Geographic Variation

Table 2 lists the most common two-digit NAICS industry codes for immigrant- and nativeowned …rms. Roughly half of immigrant-owned startups are in three sectors: accommodation
and food services, retail trade, and professional and technical services. Native-owned …rms
show less industrial concentration, as noted earlier. This industry breakdown highlights the
concentration of immigrant entrepreneurs at the upper and lower ends of the distribution.
Professional and technical services include many high-tech industries, whereas accommodation
and food services and retail trade fall into the low-tech category.
The di¤erences in …rm traits in Tables 1a-1c could be due to these industry choices, but
data from the March 2017 National Compensation Survey conducted by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics suggest that industry di¤erences are unlikely to bear full responsibility. Our working
paper tabulates in greater depth how the three most prominent sectors for immigrant-owned
businesses fall above and below national averages on most dimensions like o¤ering bene…t
plans. Upcoming regression analyses control for industry di¤erences in a rigorous manner.
Previous studies document that immigrant-owned businesses start with more funding (e.g.,

15

Fairlie 2012); the 2007 SBO shows that much of this di¤erence comes through …rms with mixed
ownership teams. Table 3 shows the most common sources of start-up capital for immigrant
entrepreneurs.16 The …rst panel reports capital sources for all new …rms, while the second two
separate …rms by industry. Firms with mixed owners report a higher use of nearly all funding
sources. Personal savings are the most important source of capital for all …rms, but this source
is especially important for …rms with immigrant owners. Firms with native owners are more
likely to have bank loans and credit, while those with immigrant owners are more likely to rely
on family loans. The use of home equity is highest among mixed owner …rms and fell across all
groups between 2007 and 2012, re‡ecting the e¤ects of the Great Recession. These patterns
may signal a lower ability by immigrants to obtain bank credit.17 Venture capital funding is
rare but consistently higher for high-tech …rms.
Figure 1 documents the states with the greatest and least reliance on immigrant entrepreneurs, with extreme values tabulated in Table 4. The least dependent states, such as Montana,
the Dakotas, and Idaho, have 6% or less of their new …rms founded by immigrants in 2012,
whereas the shares for California, New Jersey, and New York exceed 40%. These di¤erences
are naturally tied to geographic variation in where immigrants make up a large share of the
population. The correlation in 2012 between the working age population share and …rm owner
share for immigrants is 0.85 for new …rms and 0.91 for all …rms. Metropolitan areas within
states also vary substantially. The most-dependent MSAs in California display immigrant
business owner shares in excess of 60%, a 50% increase upon the state average.
Figure 2 illustrates the absolute growth of immigrant entrepreneurship by state between
the 2007 and 2012 SBO. Texas (6%), New Jersey (6%), and Alabama (5%) saw the largest
gains, while the District of Columbia (-10%), New Mexico (-5%), and South Dakota (-3%) saw
the largest declines. Figures for some of these smaller states should be treated with caution
given smaller sample size. Most states experienced modest increases, while 15 states saw a
decline, in the percent of new …rms founded by immigrant entrepreneurs between 2007 and
2012.
Figure 3 plots the share of immigrant entrepreneurs among high-tech vs. low-tech startups
by state in 2012. The included 30 states in the graph are those where a su¢ cient number of

Appendix Table A2 shows similar patterns for sources of expansion capital, with native-only …rms being
less likely to expand.

For example, Blanch‡ower et al. (2003), U.S. Chamber of Commerce (2005) and Bruder et al. (2011).

16

SBO observations pass the Census Bureau’s disclosure rules for both industry groups. Most
states are clustered around the 45-degree line, re‡ecting a similar proportion of immigrant
entrepreneurship across industries, and the correlation of the two series is 0.83. The main
outlier is New Jersey, which had more than 60% of new, high-tech …rms founded by immigrants
in 2012.

Regression Analysis of Immigrant Entrepreneurs

Our descriptive tabulations measure sizable di¤erences between immigrant- and native-owned
…rms in terms of employment, wages, and other job characteristics like employer-provided
bene…ts. This section analyzes the degree to which these di¤erences persist once we control for
state and industry choices, along with other observable traits of the owners like age, gender,
and race/ethnicity. The background regression takes the form:
Yf;t =

Imm.Entrf;t +

Mixed.Entrf;t + Xf;t +

t

+ "f;t ;

(1)

where Yf;t is a measured trait of the …rm. Imm.Entrf;t takes a (0,1) value for the founding team
being comprised exclusively of immigrants. Mixed.Entrf;t take a (0,1) value for the founding
team being comprised of both immigrants and natives. Native-only teams serve as the reference
category.
Our regression models combine the 2007 and 2012 SBO data and control for year …xed
e¤ects

t.

Baseline controls Xf;t include the …rm’s state and six-digit NAICS industry, and the

gender, age, and number of owners of the …rm. These controls are incorporated through indicator variables. We also consider ethnicity by aggregating baseline SBO categories into three
groups: African-American, Hispanic (Mexican, Cuban, Other Hispanic, not Puerto Rican),
and Asian (Chinese, Indian, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Other Asian). We
then enter for each of these groups the share of founders who are of that ethnic background.
In a second regression set, we further add a control for the log of …rm employment as a size
measure.
Figure 4 reports the

point estimates and con…dence intervals for the indicator variable of

an immigrant-only founding team. Regressions are unweighted and use robust standard errors
to derive 95% con…dence intervals. To facilitate easy comparison, we conduct these regressions
separately for high-tech vs. low-tech …rms and combine the results into Figure 4. Circles in17

dicate the coe¢ cients for immigrant founders in high-tech entrepreneurship; triangles indicate
the same for low-tech industries. The accompanying table reports the relative economic magnitude of the coe¢ cient for immigrant entrepreneurs. This e¤ect is calculated as the coe¢ cient
divided by the mean of the outcome variable. These calculations help evaluate the relative
economic magnitudes given that some outcomes are in logs (the …rst four rows) vs. indicator
variables (the rest); they also account for baseline di¤erences across industries.18
Panel A displays the results without …rm size controls. Immigrant entrepreneurs hire fewer
employees than native-owned …rms, with a sizable relative e¤ect of 16% for low-tech sectors.
The immigrant e¤ect is smaller at 5% and not statistically signi…cant for high-tech …rms. By
contrast, immigrant vs. native founder di¤erences on start-up capital raised, labor productivity
(i.e., receipts/employee), and wages tend to be quite modest and with a relative e¤ect of under
1%. The types of employees hired by immigrant-only founders look mostly similar to their
native peers.
The more noticeable di¤erences are at the bottom of Panel A. Immigrants in low-tech
settings are substantially less likely to have employer-provided bene…ts, with the relative size
ranging from 24% less for paid time o¤ to 66% for 401k plans. As a summary metric, immigrant
startups in low-tech sectors are 18% less likely to o¤er any of the three indicated employerprovided bene…ts than natives. Within the high-tech industries, the gaps are substantially
less, but still reach a 16% relative e¤ect for the o¤ering of 401k plans. In total, immigrantonly high-tech startups are 4% less likely to o¤er any of the three indicated employer-provided
bene…ts than natives. Thus, the average “job quality,” as de…ned by these metrics, is weaker
in immigrant-owned …rms, and the earlier analysis shows that the lower provision of these
bene…ts is not being o¤set in higher wages.
Similarly, but in the opposite direction, immigrant-owned startups show typically 40%70% increases in international engagement. These international engagement e¤ects are less
distinguishable between low-tech and high-tech …rms. In aggregate, immigrant founders in
low-tech and high-tech sectors are 81% and 57%, respectively, more likely to engage in one or
more of the three forms of international engagement captured by the SBO.
While we do not report the regression coe¢ cients for control variables, a few results are
18

Tables A3a-A4n in the online appendix provide our complete estimations. These tables also provide analyses
with a full sample combining high-tech and low-tech together, regression variants without control variables, and
regression variants where we do not parse out the mixed ownership group. Our NBER working paper also
contains additional variations of these regressions.

18

worth noting. Startups with more owners tend to hire more workers, start their …rms with
more capital, pay higher wages, and are also more likely to provide employee bene…ts. Larger
…rms, in general, are also more likely to pay better and to o¤er employee bene…ts. Part of
this di¤erence is due to legal mandates imposed upon larger …rms, but a long literature has
noted the greater general attractiveness of jobs in larger …rms (e.g., Moore 1911; Brown et
al. 1990; Gibson and Stillman 2009). Firms with female owners, younger owners, and lowereducated owners tend to hire fewer employees, pay lower wages and bene…ts, and engage less
in international activities.
In most cases, these estimated coe¢ cients and e¤ects in Figure 4 resemble what is observed
in tabulations of the raw data; we also tend to …nd similar results (tabulated in the appendix)
when excluding all …rm controls Xf;t . One of the more interesting exceptions is that the lower
wage rates paid by immigrant …rms in the low-tech sector would be more signi…cant at 1%1.5% in relative terms without the controls, compared to the 0.2% with the controls. State
and industry choices account for about half of the di¤erence, and adding ethnicity controls
accounts for the rest, with Asian and Hispanic owned …rms paying lower wages in the low-tech
sector.
Panel B introduces the …rm size control. It is debatable whether one should control for
the fact that immigrants tend to own di¤erent-sized …rms than natives, as we use …rm size
in constructing some metrics (e.g., receipts per employment) and the size of a company is
endogenous with other …rm outcomes. Nevertheless, the overall picture remains very similar.
For most …rm traits, this control slightly diminishes the coe¢ cients and relative magnitudes,
but the major themes of weaker provision of bene…ts and greater overseas activity persist.
Figure 5 plots regression coe¢ cients similar to Figure 4 for a variant of speci…cation (1) that
combines the immigrant only and mixed team indicator variables. Most of themes emphasized
above are reproduced, as the number of mixed ownership teams is small compared to the
immigrant only count. The most noticeable di¤erences are a moderating e¤ect on the observed
lower provision of employer-provided bene…ts by immigrant owned companies and an expansion
of di¤erences compared to native only …rms for international engagement.
Finally, Tables 5a and 5b study the survival and growth properties of immigrant- vs. nativeowned …rms using the subsequent history of 2007 SBO …rms to 2011 in the LBD. The sample
begins with 139 thousand companies that were founded between 2002 and 2007 and present

19

in the 2007 SBO. Among those …rms matched to the 2007 LBD, immigrant-only founded
…rms are somewhat more likely to survive to 2011 than are native-owned …rms (62.8% versus
60.1%). Conditional on survival until 2011, immigrant-only …rms remain somewhat smaller
than native-only …rm, with immigrant-only startups growing their employment 23% to 2011
versus 19% for natives.19
As we parse the sample into high-tech vs. low-tech, interesting di¤erences emerge. The
survival rate for immigrant-only high-tech startups tends to be equal to or less than native-only
…rms, but the growth rate is signi…cantly faster in large part due to a smaller starting size.
For low-tech, immigrant-only …rms are more likely to survive and again appear to catch-up in
terms of employment by 2012 to native-only …rms.
Table 5b shows the stability of these patterns in regression formats, using linear probability
models for survival. In aggregate, immigrant-founded …rms in high-tech behave in a manner
quite similar to native-founded high-tech …rms, whereas di¤erences for low-tech remain conditional on size. The faster growth of immigrant-owned …rms in both samples directly connects
to their smaller starting size. The 2007-2011 period was, of course, the depths of the Great
Recession, and with the future extensions of the LBD it will be important to look at these
patterns throughout the subsequent recovery.

Extensions

5.1

Spatial Di¤erences

We earlier noted that immigrant entrepreneurship is unevenly distributed across the country,
with eight-fold or higher di¤erences across states. Florida (2005), Moretti (2012), and other
scholars emphasize the growth of powerful high-tech and knowledge centers, with spillover
e¤ects onto job creation for other workers. The authors frequently connect these dynamic
clusters to immigration and entrepreneurship, and many business press accounts speak of a
Silicon Valley exceptionalism. We turn to describing with new data the role of immigration
entrepreneurs across tech hubs.20
19

We de…ne growth through the log ratio of 2011 employment to 2007 employment, and the patterns are very
similar if instead using the Davis et al. (1996) formula with average employment as the baseline.
20
In addition to providing an economic portrait of current activity, these distributions can be informative
for potential policy changes to encourage regional visas for incoming skilled immigrants. Such visas are used,
for example, in Canada and are often discussed as a mechanism for building broader policy consensus around
expanded migration.

20

Table 6 describes how immigrant entrepreneurs are distributed over MSAs. While 29%
of new high-tech …rms are owned by immigrants or mixed teams, this share is 63% in the
San Francisco Bay area and 44% in other top tech clusters, compared to 18% elsewhere.
Dramatically, about 4% of all high-tech …rms owned by immigrants are located in the San
Francisco Bay area, compared to 1% for natives. New immigrant-founded …rms also constitute
high shares of low-tech activity in the big tech centers, but there is overall more mass of
immigrant low-tech startups outside of the top 10 tech clusters.
Figure 6 maps regression coe¢ cients for immigrant-only, mixed, and native-only founding
teams by location, with native-only founding teams located outside of the top 10 tech clusters
serving as the reference group. Appendix Table 6 provides the underlying regressions. Panel A
of Figure 6 shows that high-tech …rms founded by immigrants only are modestly under-sized
relative to their peers in the top 10 tech clusters, but the bigger di¤erences are in the low-tech
sector where immigrant-only startups are smaller within and outside of tech centers.
The remaining panels of Figure 6 condition on …rm size in addition to the other controls.
For startup …nancing, immigrant-only teams raise more seed capital within and outside of
the top tech clusters, whereas no real di¤erence exists for low-tech sectors. On receipts per
employee, immigrant-only teams look mostly similar to their native-only counterparts, while
wages paid by immigrant-only …rms are lower in high tech clusters than peer companies. Lower
provision of employer-provided bene…ts by immigrant-only …rms is most pronounced in lowtech sectors, regardless of spatial position, and the gap is erased in mixed teams. By contrast,
the greater propensity by immigrant founders towards international activities is strongest in
high-tech sectors and independent of a mixed or immigrant-only founding team.
We interpret these results as suggesting that most of the impact of immigrant high-tech
entrepreneurship for tech centers happens through the quantity dimension: Silicon Valley and
similar tech hubs attract a lot of immigrant founders. Being located in a high-tech cluster
demands more of companies: higher receipts per employee and greater wages. Immigrantfounded …rms are not very di¤erent on these dimensions, providing slightly lower wages and
bene…ts, as we have seen in prior analyses. This is somewhat to be expected: when representing
40% or more of local startups, it is harder for immigrant founders in tech clusters to behave
too di¤erently from peer entrants.21
21

Earlier versions of this paper considered generic state-level policies like minimum wages and occupational
licensing, …nding little explanatory power. Interesting for future research, an index developed by Monogan

21

We supplement this SBO analysis with comparable evidence from the publicly available
American Community Survey (ACS) data. Within the ACS, the closest metric to business
ownership is self-employed individuals in incorporated businesses (SE-I). The primary ACS
sample is restricted to individuals who report their place of birth and are aged between 25 and
55. The ACS shows that an increasing share of SE-I entrepreneurs are immigrants, growing
from 17% in 2001 to about 24% by 2015.22
Table 7 again shows immigrant SE-I are disproportionately agglomerated in top tech hubs
compared to native SE-I. While the ACS collected fewer data …elds, we can look at income
levels reported for the individual and household. Interestingly, immigrant SE-I in high-tech
industries report mostly comparable income to native SE-I in all geographic settings. By
contrast, low-tech immigrant SE-I report lower incomes than native SE-I and these di¤erences
become more pronounced in leading tech hubs, as the incomes for native SE-I rise faster.
These intriguing patterns suggest that immigrants engaged in high-tech entrepreneurship in
the prominent tech hubs are quite similar to their native peers, but that these larger cities also
have a more expansive low-tech immigrant entrepreneurship sector that behaves di¤erently
from native-led startups nearby in these sectors.

5.2

Second-Generation Immigrant Entrepreneurs

The SBO data allow the identi…cation of individuals who were born in the United States but
are of a speci…c ethnic origin, including Chinese, Indian, and Mexican. While the survey does
not ask whether one or both their parents were born outside of the United States, one can
approximate second-generation immigrants via ethnicity. Using the public use ACS data for
2001-2016, we …nd that 94% of U.S.-born persons who report to be of Chinese ethnic origin
have at least one parent who is an immigrant. These percentages are 99% and 71% for persons
of Indian and Mexican ethnic origin, respectively. Table 8 repeats the earlier tabulations in
(2013) to quantify the state-level “tone of immigrant policy”enacted between 2005 and 2011 can predict higher
immigrant entrepreneur shares over-and-above the immigrant population baseline. This index captures features
like the ability of immigrants to obtain an ID or drivers license to enforcement activities by U.S. Immigration
and Customs Enforcement. A one standard-deviation in policy tone predicts a 1-2% increase in immigrant
founder shares.
22
Similar to Figure 2, most states show growing immigrant SE-I shares across this time period, with 14 states
exceeding 6% growth, while only three states— West Virginia, Vermont, and Maine— saw declines. Immigrant
SE-I has pulled increasingly from individuals coming from Mexico, India, and China since 2001, although no
country accounts for more than 4% of the total SE-I stock in 2015. In 2015, immigrant SE-I shares are higher
for those with STEM degrees (27%) or Business/Education (22%) compared to other …elds (17%). Our NBER
working paper provides additional statistics related to this sample.

22

Table 1a but separates out the entrepreneurial activity of second-generation immigrants to the
United States. We identify these individuals as those labelling themselves as born in America
but of an immigrant ethnicity. These labels are imperfect, to be sure, but also provide a
reasonable approximation on a phenomenon of broad interest.23
For these tabulations, Columns 1 and 4 report statistics where only …rst-generation immigrants are owners of the business, potentially along with natives, but no second-generation immigrants own the business. Columns 2 and 5 focus only on businesses where second-generation
immigrants are owners, potentially along with natives, but no …rst-generation immigrants are
owners. Columns 3 and 6 document cases where only natives are owners. As such, the columns
are mutually exclusive but not collectively exhaustive. In particular, about 1% of the sample is
not included and represents cases where both …rst- and second-generation immigrant business
ownership is reported for the …rm. With this framing, second-generation immigrants account
for approximately 4% of U.S. entrepreneurship in 2007 and 6% in 2012.
A fascinating pattern emerges:

on many dimensions where the di¤erences between

immigrant- and native-owned …rms are most visible (e.g., o¤ering health insurance, exporting),
businesses owned by second-generation immigrants sit in between the other two …rm types.
This patterns highlights a potential assimilation of immigrant-founded …rms into the broader
business landscape of America which has not been documented before.24 Second-generation
immigrant owners tend to be younger than the other owner types, which may, for example,
a¤ect their ability to accumulate start-up capital. Female-owned …rms (whether fully or partially) are most common in the group of second-generation immigrant-owned companies, in
both the newly founded and all …rms samples.
23

Duncan and Trejo (2018) review the evidence regarding second-generation immigrants in the United States,
their education assimilation, and the heterogeneity across countries of origin, but entrepreneurship remains under explored. Case examples include Waters (1994), Zhou and Bankston (1994), and Berry et al. (2006). Data
from the 2012 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) indicate that US …rst-generation immigrants are more
entrepreneurial than either natives or second-generation immigrants (Kelley et al. 2012). Looking at Fortune
500 companies in 2011, roughly equal proportions of them were founded by …rst-generation (19%) and secondgeneration (23%) immigrants (Partnership for a New American Economy 2011). Andersson and Hammarstedt
(2010) study the self-employment activity of second-generation immigrants in Sweden, and Beckers and Blumberg (2013) consider the Netherlands. While the SBO cannot quantify rates of entry into entrepreneurship by
…rst- versus second-generation immigrants, the data allow us to describe their businesses.
24
It important to note that the assimilation interpretation cannot be distinguished with these data from
cohort e¤ects. The SBO second-generation entrepreneurs are children of …rst-generation immigrants from an
earlier cohort, who came from di¤erent places and under di¤erent contexts than the …rst-generation immigrants
of today. To fully untangle, future work needs access to data sources like the Internal Revenue Service that
directly link second-generation children to their immigrant parents.

Discussion and Future Research

We explored the 2007 and 2012 Survey of Business Owners records to learn more about how
the businesses created by immigrants resemble and di¤er from those owned by natives. To
summarize a few key …ndings: immigrant-owned …rms are somewhat smaller than nativeowned …rms in terms of employee counts but have comparable or greater sales per employee; the
jobs created by immigrant …rms have mostly comparable salaries but lower provision of health,
retirement, and paid time o¤ bene…ts; and the …rms owned by immigrants show a substantially
higher rate of engagement in international activity like exporting and the launch of overseas
facilities. Immigrant-owned businesses have a modestly di¤erent industry composition than
native-owned business, but the bigger di¤erences are spatial, with ten-fold di¤erences across
states in terms of the share of businesses owned by immigrants. Finally, new immigrant-owned
businesses in the 2007 SBO are more likely to survive to 2011 and show greater employment
growth to 2011.
There are several important directions future research can take. We have provided novel
evidence on the quality of jobs generated by immigrant-owned …rms in terms of compensation
and bene…ts, but there many other dimensions worth pursuing. Merging onto the SBO the
Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) database would allow researchers to look
at the duration of jobs and the evolution of earnings over tenure for workers in immigrantversus native-owned …rms. The LEHD’s mostly universal nature would also allow a greater
characterization of ethnic enclaves within regions and how immigrant entrepreneurs function
inside vs. external to them.
Uniting the Decennial Census …les with the SBO data would also provide greater information on the countries of origin of immigrants. These extra data would allow researchers
to examine more sharply di¤erences over groups. As immigrant entrepreneurship rates differ somewhat by nationality, one could learn more about how much of these patterns follow
from group-wide preferences to be one’s own boss (Hurst and Pugsley 2011) and how the
concentration of immigrant groups into speci…c occupations for entrepreneurship (Kerr and
Mandor¤ 2015) shifts their behavior. Such extensive margin evidence would better highlight
the mechanisms behind perceived di¤erences in job quality.
The evidence regarding greater overseas activity of immigrant-owned businesses also deserves more consideration. These contributions may be more quantitative and model-based:
24

what are the general equilibrium implications of a rising share of U.S. entrepreneurs being immigrants and therefore being more likely to engage in global activities? As the period of time
covered by these surveys includes some countries expanding and others contracting, the relative value of these overseas connections will provide nice variation to tease out their empirical
e¤ects.
Finally, we have provided some basic evidence and back-of-the-envelope calculations for
job provision in immigrant …rms in the introduction, but more of the job creation and job
destruction machinery (e.g., Davis et al. 1996) and growth analysis (e.g., Puri and Zarutskie
2012) could be applied to these groups. This would be especially powerful when combined
with information on the individuals hired. Immigrant owners may show di¤erent employment
adjustment patterns for immigrant employees from their home country than immigrants from
other countries or native employees. Given the heavy geographic and industrial clustering of
immigrant entrepreneurs, this could in turn in‡uence regional business cycles.

Figure 1: Immigrant entrepreneur share of SBO employer firms in 2012

Notes: Sample includes non-public employer firms from the 2012 SBO, with entrepreneurship measured through new
firms created in the five years prior to the survey. These statistics combine Immigrant only and Mixed teams.

Figure 2: Change in percent of new firms founded by immigrant entrepreneurs by
state between SBO 2007 and 2012

Notes: See Figure 1.

Figure 3: Immigrant entrepreneur distribution in high-tech vs. low-tech sectors in
2012

Notes: See Figure 1. Sample includes 30 states for which the number of firms is above the Census Bureau’s disclosure
cut-off for both high-tech and low-tech sectors. The correlation across series is 0.83.

Figure 4: Estimations for firm traits of immigrant entrepreneurs
Panel A: Baseline controls

Panel B: Baseline controls plus firm size control

Notes: See Figure 1 and Table 1a. Estimations pool 2007 and 2012 data. Coefficients are from an indicator variable for
Immigrant only owners. Panel A includes fixed effects for year, state, and 6-digit industry and controls for the gender,
ethnicity/race, age, and number of owners. Panel B further controls for log employment. Regressions are unweighted
and show 95% confidence intervals based upon robust standard errors. Appendix Tables A3a-n tabulate results. Relative
economic magnitudes are calculated as the ratio of the regression coefficient and the mean of the dependent variable.

Notes: Sample includes non-public employer firms, with entrepreneurship measured as new firms created in the
five years prior to the survey. Data for 2007 use noise infusion for employment, receipts, and payroll, as well as
variables derived using those measures. Reported numbers use tabulation weighting and are rounded to
maximum of four significant digits. Groupings: Immigrant only includes firms with only immigrant owners, Mixed
includes firms with both immigrant and native owners, and Native only includes firms with only native owners.
Immigrant only and Mixed are combined in this table.
