Geography and Agricultural Productivity: Cross-Country Evidence from Micro Plot-Level

ABSTRACT
Why is agricultural productivity so low in poor countries relative to the rest of the world? Is it
due to geography or constrained economic choices? We assess the quantitative role of geography
and land quality for agricultural productivity differences across countries using high-resolution
micro-geography data and a spatial accounting framework. Our rich spatial data provide in each
cell of land covering the entire globe actual yields of cultivated crops and potential yields for 18
crops, which measure the maximum attainable output for each crop given soil quality, climate
conditions, terrain topography, and a level of cultivation inputs. While there is considerable
heterogeneity in land quality across space, even within narrow geographic regions, we find that
low agricultural productivity in poor countries is not due to poor land endowments. If countries
produced current crops in each cell according to potential yields, the rich-poor agricultural yield
gap would virtually disappear, from more than 200 percent to less than 5 percent. We also find
evidence of additional productivity gains attainable through the spatial reallocation of production
and changes in crop choices.

Introduction

Understanding the large differences in output per worker across rich and poor countries is a fundamental issue on the research agenda in economics. It is now well understood that the cross-country
differences in real agricultural output per worker are considerably larger than those at the aggregate
level, particularly when comparing rich to poor countries.1 Why is agricultural productivity so low
in poor countries? The answer to this question has important implications for poverty reduction,
welfare, structural transformation, and development.
There are two broad possible explanations for the rich-poor disparity in real agricultural productivity. First, due to varied institutions, constraints, frictions, or policies, poor countries make different
economic choices in agriculture than rich countries, affecting the level of inputs used, the technology adopted, or the allocation of inputs across farmers. Second, due to unfortunate endowments,
featuring poor land quality, rugged geography, and arid lands, poor countries may have a natural
disadvantage in agriculture. Understanding which of these two broad explanations is the source
of low agricultural productivity in poor countries is essential and has dramatically different implications for policy. The vast majority of research has focused on the first set of explanations of
constrained economic decisions affecting agricultural productivity in poor countries.2 The role of
land quality and geography, while often presumed and invoked in public debates on development,
is largely unexplored on a systematic cross-country basis, perhaps due to lack of data availability.
In this paper, we systematically quantify the role of geography and land quality for agricultural
productivity differences across 162 countries, using the best currently available data. In particular,
we use high-resolution gridded micro-geography data, covering the entire globe, from the Global
Agro-Ecological Zones (GAEZ) project of the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). A cell

See, for instance, Gollin et al. (2002) and Restuccia et al. (2008).
Some of the explanations include: low intermediate input use Restuccia et al. (2008); poor transport infrastructure Adamopoulos (2011); misallocation of labor between agriculture and non-agriculture Restuccia et al. (2008),
selection Lagakos and Waugh (2013), misallocation of factors across farms within agriculture Adamopoulos and
Restuccia (2014), international transport frictions Tombe (2015), idiosyncratic risk Donovan (2016), among others.

of land in the gridded data is roughly a 10 by 10 kilometer plot, and should not be confused with
plots of land operated by individual farms, which in poor countries would typically be much smaller
than a cell plot. GAEZ provides land quality attributes, and actual yields (physical output per
unit of land) by crop on each cell of land in the world. Importantly, the data also reports for
each cell potential yields for all the main crops, including those crops not actually produced in the
cell. The data on potential yields by crop are generated by combining cell -specific land quality
attributes with established crop-specific agronomic models, for a given level of water supply and
cultivation inputs. We develop a simple spatial-accounting framework that allows us to aggregate
up from the cell-crop–level resolution to the country–level. The analysis imposes minimal structure,
using the detailed data through a series of relevant counterfactuals to determine to what extent low
land productivity in poor countries is the result of unfortunate geography or the result of deliberate
economic choices given their geography, in terms of what crops are produced, how efficiently they are
produced, and where they are produced within the country. While we find evidence of considerable
heterogeneity in land quality, even within narrow geographic regions, our main finding is that, at
the aggregate level, low agricultural productivity in poor countries is not due to poor land quality
and geography. If both rich and poor countries could produce according to their potential yields
given their internal distribution of land quality, the rich-poor agricultural yield gap would virtually
disappear, from more than 200 percent to less than 5 percent. Our evidence indicates that the yield
gap is primarily due to low efficiency at the cell level. Crop choices within cells and the location of
crop production within a country play an important but secondary role.
A distinctive feature of agriculture is that it is an activity that takes place across space, using
location-specific inputs such as soil quality, climate conditions, and terrain topography.3 These
inputs could matter not only for what yield a farmer gets for any crop cultivated, but also for what
crops are ultimately cultivated on each cell (see e.g. Holmes and Lee, 2012) and what cells are used
3

In contrast to agriculture, the quality of land is less of a factor for manufacturing plants or service-sector
establishments.

for agricultural production. Traditional measures of land quality in cross-country comparisons, such
as the percentage of agricultural land classified as arable or cropland, or the percentage of arable
land or cropland that is irrigated face two main problems. First, they can be affected by economic
decisions and hence are not exogenous. Second, they are average measures for the whole country
and may confound important within-country spatial variation in land quality. To the best of our
knowledge, our paper is the first systematic quantitative assessment of the role that differences
in geography and land quality play in understanding agricultural productivity differences across
countries using explicitly spatial micro-geography data.
Given the data from GAEZ, the measure of agricultural productivity that we focus on is real
agricultural output per unit of cultivated land, also known as land productivity or yield.4 While
cross-country differences in aggregate yields account only for a portion of agricultural labor productivity differences, yields encapsulate the role of land quality and geography.5 In fact, the measure
of potential yield we focus on should be understood as a measure of potential TFP, given a level
of inputs. Further, yields have implications for the other component of labor productivity, average
farm size. To put this into perspective, note that differences in agricultural TFP of a factor of
3-fold due to land endowments or efficiency in production would trigger a substantial process of
reallocation and structural change with much larger variations in average farm size and agricultural
labor productivity (see for instance Adamopoulos and Restuccia 2014).
4

We consider two types of yield measures. First, the average yield over groups of crops, measured as the total
value of crops—evaluated at a common set of international crop prices from the FAO—over the total amount of
cultivated land. Second, physical output in tonnes per unit of land for individual crops. Our data permit us to
construct the average and the individual crop yields both at the cell-level and at the country-level. The upside of
our first measure is that it allows us to construct summary measures of overall agricultural productivity across plots
and countries. The upside of our second measure is that it allows us to compare the same good across plots and
countries (“apples for apples”) without the need for aggregation using international prices. In a robustness section
we also value crops according to caloric content which has more relevance for poor countries.
5
The remaining differences in output per worker in agriculture are accounted for by the land to labor ratio, which
since most of the labor in agriculture reflects the family farm, the land to labor ratio is roughy proportional to farm
size,

We develop a simple quantitative spatial-accounting framework to decompose the economy-wide
aggregate yield into the contributions of: (i) within cell-crop efficiency, and (ii) across cell-crop
efficiency. In particular, we consider a world in which each country consists of a given number of
cells of land. Each cell can produce any of a given number of crops. However, cells of land are
heterogeneous with respect to their inherent suitability in producing each crop. In the data we
capture a cell’s suitability in producing a given crop by its potential yield from GAEZ. We show
that a country’s aggregate yield—the ratio of the real value of its output to the total cultivated
land—can be expressed as a weighted average of the cell-crop yields valued at common prices, where
the weights are the cell-crop land shares. The economy-wide aggregate yield is obtained if actual
yields are used in this expression.
We use this simple expression for the aggregate yield—as a weighted average of cell-crop yields—to
construct counterfactual yields for each country. In our main counterfactual we assess the role of
production efficiency by keeping the cell-crop land shares fixed to the actual data but allowing the
corresponding crops in each cell to be produced according to their potential yields rather than their
actual yields. This counterfactual is relevant in assessing the role of geography and land quality
because potential yields summarize how detailed geographical attributes translate into productivity.
If the disparity in aggregate yields across countries is similar under potential yields than with actual
yields, then this counterfactual would tell us that most of the variation in actual aggregate yields
is due to geography and land quality differences. We find quite the opposite. We find that if
countries produced according to potential rather than actual in each cell-crop, the aggregate yield
disparity between the richest and poorest 10 percent of countries would drop from 214 percent to
5 percent. In other words, the productivity disparity would virtually disappear. Across our entire
sample of countries this counterfactual potential yield does not systematically vary with the level
of GDP per capita. We also show that this basic finding is robust to: weighing crops according
to their caloric content (rather than FAO international prices); using unconstrained agro-climatic
yields; using alternative (common) level of cultivation practices and inputs; and, using alternative
5

(common) water supply assumptions.
We also assess the productivity improvements that would result from the spatial reallocation of crop
production exploiting locations’ comparative advantages but holding the country-level land share
of each crop to its actual level. While we find that spatial reallocation would raise productivity in
both rich and poor countries, such a reallocation would not disproportionately affect poor countries.
Finally, we assess the effects of total efficiency, where each cell in each country is allowed to produce
the highest value yielding crop. We find that if countries produced in each cell the highest potential
yielding crops then the rich-poor aggregate yield disparity would drop further and turn to a gain
of 23 percent for poor countries (i.e., the rich to poor ratio falls to 0.77-fold). The implication of
this counterfactual is that poor countries produce systematically lower yielding crops given their
land quality. From the overall reduction from the 3.14-fold actual yield gap to the counterfactual
0.77-fold yield gap, 80 percent is accounted for by improved production efficiency within each cropcell. Our findings suggest that poor land quality is not the source of low agricultural productivity
in poor countries. Instead, it is the economic choices made by poor countries in terms of what is
produced, how it is produced, and where it is produced given their geography, that lies behind their
low productivity problem.
Our paper contributes to the growing literature studying real agricultural productivity differences
across countries. One branch of this literature, including Restuccia et al. (2008), Adamopoulos
(2011), Lagakos and Waugh (2013), Adamopoulos and Restuccia (2014), Tombe (2015), Donovan
(2016) among others, has used quantitative models to assess the contribution of particular factors
that can affect either the level of inputs used in agriculture or their allocation. Another branch of
this literature has focused on measuring sectoral agriculture to non-agriculture productivity gaps
across countries (Herrendorf and Schoellman 2015, Gollin et al. 2014b) or cross-country agricultural
productivity disparities (Prasada Rao 1993, Restuccia et al. 2008, Gollin et al. 2014a). While our
paper is also about measurement, we differ from the above literature in two important ways. First,

6

we focus on measuring the role of land quality and geography for real agricultural productivity gaps.
Second, we use spatially explicit micro-geography data to measure actual and potential agricultural
yield gaps across countries.
Importantly, our paper is also related to the literature that studies cross-country differences in
aggregate land quality indices and their effect on agricultural productivity. While traditional measures of land quality, such as the Peterson Index, were subject to the criticism that they included
components that were not exogenous, more recent efforts have focused on measures that are affected less by economic decisions. For instance, Wiebe (2003) constructs a land quality index which
utilizes soil and climate properties to classify a country’s cropland (a much more narrow concept
of land, already used for agricultural production).6 We differ from this approach in two ways: (a)
we exploit the explicit spatial nature of the micro-geography data in GAEZ, and (b) we use an
accounting framework which allows us to assess the contributions of land quality in accounting for
real agricultural productivity.
We are not the first economists to use the GAEZ data. Nunn and Qian (2011) use an earlier version
of the GAEZ data to assess the suitability of Old World regions for the cultivation of the potato, in
order to estimate the effect of the potato on population and urbanization. Costinot et al. (2016) use
the GAEZ data to study the effects of projected climate change on aggregate output through the
evolution of comparative advantage and the accompanying adjustments in production and trade.
Costinot and Donaldson (2012) use the GAEZ data to test the Ricardian theory of comparative
advantage. Costinot and Donaldson (2016) use it to study the gains from economic integration
within the United States.7 To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to exploit the GAEZ
data to study the macro-level implications of land quality endowments for cross-country differences
6
Wiebe and Breneman (2000) use the same underlying data to construct a complementary measure of land quality:
the share of a country’s cropland that is not limited by major soil or climate constraints to agricultural production
(cropland in the highest three land quality classes). This measure is a fraction and ranges from 0 to 1. They include
this measure in a regression to study the effect of land quality on agricultural labor productivity.

Donaldson and Storeygard (2016) provide an excellent general survey on the use of high-resolution spatial data
in economics.

in real agricultural productivity, an issue that is paramount for understanding the foundation of
poverty across the world.
The paper proceeds as follows. The next section describes the GAEZ data in some detail and
provides some observations on land quality dispersion across countries. In Section 3 we outline
the spatial accounting framework, describe our counterfactuals, and present our main findings.
Section 4 performs robustness analysis of our main results with respect to using caloric content of
crops instead of international FAO prices in aggregation, using the agro-climatic yield instead of
the potential yield, and making different assumptions about the level of inputs and water supply
conditions in calculating potential yields across countries. We conclude in Section 5.

Data

We first describe the details of the data we use and then we characterize differences in individual
land quality characteristics across countries, based on this data.

2.1

Description

We use gridded micro-geography data from the Global Agro-Ecological Zones (GAEZ) project,
developed by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) in collaboration with the International
Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); and aggregate cross-country income data from the
Penn World Table (PWTv6.3). GAEZ is a standardized framework for the characterization of
climate, soil, and terrain conditions relevant for agricultural production. GAEZ combines state-ofthe-art established agronomic models by crop, that account for science-based biophysical growing
requirements for each crop, with high resolution spatial data on geographic attributes.

8

The information in GAEZ is available at the 5 arc-minute resolution. To picture it, imagine superimposing a grid of about 9 million cells or pixels covering the entire world. Figure 1 displays a
grid map of the Montreal and Toronto area in Canada, based on cells of different resolutions, where
the pink grid represents a 5-arc min; the blue grid a 30-arc min; and the black grid a 60-arc min.
While the size of each cell is constant at 5 arc-minutes in the data, it is not constant in terms of
squared kilometers or hectares, as the mapping from arc-minutes to square kilometers depends on
the distance from the equator (latitude). As a rough approximation the size of each cell can be
described as 10 × 10 kilometers.
Figure 1: Grid Resolution Example Montreal-Toronto Area

Notes: The pink grid represents a 5-arc min; the blue grid a 30-arc min; and the black grid a 60-arc min.

For each cell in the grid, GAEZ reports data on the following location-specific geographic attributes
that are important for agricultural production: (1) soil quality, which includes depth, fertility,
drainage, texture, chemical composition; (2) climate conditions, which include temperature, sunshine hours, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed; and (3) terrain and topography, which include
9

elevation and slope. In addition, for each crop GAEZ classifies each cell according to the extent of
its soil, terrain, climate constraints for the production of that crop. The same information is used to
construct a crop-specific suitability index, which summarizes biophysical limitations in producing
each crop. Most importantly for our purposes, GAEZ calculates a potential yield for each crop in
each cell, measured as the maximum possible output (in tonnes) per hectare that can be attained
in the cell given the crop’s production requirements, the cell’s characteristics, and assumptions
about water supply conditions and cultivation practices. Therefore, potential yields represent total
factor productivity estimates given quantity and quality of inputs. Potential yields are calculated
pixel-by-pixel for all major crops, including those not actually produced in a particular cell.
There are two key ingredients that go into the GAEZ estimation of potential yields for each crop in
each cell. First, the detailed micro-geography characteristics on soil quality, climate, and topography
outlined above for that particular cell. Second, crop-specific agronomic models that reflect each
crop’s biophysical requirements for growth. The parameters of the agronomic models capture how
a particular set of geographic conditions maps into any given crop’s yield. These parameters are
based on well tested field and lab experiments by agricultural research institutes, are established
in the agronomic literature, and are updated to reflect the latest state of scientific knowledge. We
stress that the agronomic model parameters are not based off a regression analysis of observed
choices on outputs and inputs across countries, regions, or farms, an analysis that would be subject
to serious endogeneity issues.
Potential yields are reported for alternative configurations of water supply conditions (irrigated,
rain-fed, and total which includes both rain fed and irrigated) and type of cultivation practices
(input intensity use and management).8 The idea is that the resulting yield for each crop on each
8

Low level of inputs (traditional management) assumes subsistence based farming, labor intensive techniques, no
application of nutrients, chemicals, and pesticides. Intermediate level of inputs (improved management) assumes
partly market oriented farming, improved varieties with hand tools and/or animal traction, some mechanization,
medium labor intensity, use of some fertilizer, chemicals, and pesticides. High level of inputs (advanced management)
assumes mainly market oriented farming, high yield variety seeds, fully mechanized with low labor intensity, optimum
application of nutrients, chemicals, and pesticides as well as disease and weed control.

10

plot would depend not only on the “endowment” of land quality and geography but also on the set
of complementary inputs applied by the farmer. For this reason, we control for water supply and
cultivation practices by keeping them constant across cells and countries. In our main results, we
assume total water supply conditions and mixed level of inputs, which assumes high inputs on the
best land, intermediate inputs on moderately suitable land, and low inputs on marginal land. This
allows for a consistent quantification of potential land productivity around the world. We then show
that as long as assumptions on complementary inputs are held constant across countries, choosing
alternative assumptions does not alter our main conclusions.
Potential yields in GAEZ are calculated for both average historical climate conditions (with the
baseline reference period being 1960-1990), individual historical years 1901-2009, as well as projected
future climate conditions based on a number of climate models. In our analysis, we use potential
yields based on the average historical climate conditions, as they iron-out year-to-year idiosyncratic
weather shocks.
The GAEZ database also provides at the 5 arc-minute resolution, for the year 2000, data on crop
choice, actual production, actual area cultivated, and actual yield, i.e., tonnes of production per
hectare of the crop actually planted. The actual production data for each cell are estimated using a flexible iterative rebalancing methodology that sequentially down-scales regional agricultural
production statistics. The actual production data at the cell level are available for all major crops.
In addition, the database contains land cover data that classify land in each cell in terms of urban,
cultivated, forest, grassland and woodland, water bodies, and other uses.
The data set we work with has global coverage, consisting of 162 countries. In 2000, the countries
in our sample account for 87 percent of the world production of cereal in terms of acreage and 81
percent of the value of crop production.9 The count of grid cells (pixels) per country varies widely,
from as low as 5 (Antigua and Barbuda) to as high as 421,168 (Russia). The median country in

our data set consists of 2,827 cells. A complete list of the countries in our data set, along with
their cell counts, and their GDP per capita (from the Penn World Table) are provided in Table A.1
in the Appendix. Our analysis focuses on 18 main crops and commodity groups, that cover the
majority of produced crops across the world.10 In 2000 these crops accounted for 83 percent of the
entire world production of crops in terms of acreage, and 60 percent in terms of value of production
(based on data from FAOSTAT).
GAEZ provides the information for each variable in raster (grid cell) files, which we work with in
ArcGIS. To aggregate cell-level information to administrative units, such as regions, provinces, and
countries, we use shape files from the World Borders data set of “Thematic Mapping.”11

2.2

Land Characteristics across the World

We use the micro-geography data from GAEZ to illustrate the diversity of some key land quality and
geography characteristics across the world. We first illustrate these characteristics in a series of maps
constructed using ArcGIS, and then summarize them across countries in Table 1. Figure 2 classifies
the entire earth’s soil at the 5 arc-minute resolution according to its nutrient availability, which
captures soil properties such as texture (e.g., clay, silt, sand), organic carbon content, acidity (pH),
and the sum of sodium, calcium, magnesium and potassium. Nutrient availability is an important
indicator of soil fertility, particularly in environments with low application of intermediate inputs.
The classification determines how constrained the soil in each cell is in terms of its nutrient content,
ranging from no/slightly constrained (index value of 1) to very severely constrained (index value of
4).
Figure 3 documents the median altitude within each cell for the whole world. Altitude is an

The crops in our data set are: wheat, rice, maize, sorghum, millet, other cereals (barley, rye, oat, and other
minor cereals), tubers (white potato, sweet potato), roots (cassava, yam and cocoyam), sugarcane, sugarbeets, pulses
(chickpea, cowpea, dry pea, grams, pigeon-pea), soybean, sunflower, rapeseed, groundnut, oilpalm, olive, cotton.

important indicator of terrain suitability for agricultural production, as it affects solar radiation,
oxygen availability as well as temperatures and moisture. The altitude varies tremendously across
the world, with a high of 6500 meters to a low of -415.
Figures 4 and 5 document mean annual temperature (in degrees Celsius) and annual precipitation
(in mm) at the pixel-level. Temperature is an example of an indicator of thermal regimes, while
rainfall is an example of an indicator of moisture regimes. Both thermal and moisture regimes are
important measures of agro-climatic conditions and serve as key inputs into the GAEZ methodology
in constructing crop-specific potential yields by cell. Again, these maps illustrate the wide diversity
of agro-climatic conditions across the world.
It is not surprising that there is such wide variation in land quality characteristics across the world.
Even within narrow geographic regions some locations are naturally advantaged in terms of one
or more characteristics, while others are naturally disadvantaged. The importance of a naturally

advantageous geographic environment for agricultural production at the plot level is ubiquitous.
However, agricultural productivity differences between the developed and developing world are often
framed at the country level. As a result, we are interested in whether the land quality characteristics
vary systematically across rich and poor countries and whether the differences in land quality have
a substantial impact in accounting for the agricultural productivity differences we observe across
these countries.
In order to examine the cross-country variation in land quality attributes in Table 1 we summarize
mean soil, terrain, and climate conditions for rich and poor countries—ordered by their real GDP
per capita—as well as the countries at the top and bottom end of the distribution of that characteristic across the world. For soil quality conditions we present “fertility,” which captures nutrient
availability (same indicator as in Figure 2) and is measured as an index from 1 (unconstrained) to
4 (constrained), and “depth,” which captures rooting conditions, and is also measured as a 1 to
4 index. The terrain conditions we report are “slope,” measured as an index between 0 and 100,

and “altitude” which measures mean elevation in meters (same as in Figure 3). The slope of a plot
is important, as it can affect for example the farming practices employed (standard mechanization
can be difficult on steep irregular slopes) and the extent of topsoil erosion. The climatic conditions
we report are “temperature,” measured in degrees Celsius (as in Figure 4), and “precipitation,”
measured in mm (as in Figure 5). The first two columns report the averages of these attributes
across countries in the richest and poorest deciles of the 162 countries in our sample, while the
third column reports the rich-to-poor ratio of the attribute. The fourth and fifth columns report
the averages over the countries with the top and bottom deciles of the cross-country distribution of
each attribute, and the last column reports the top-to-bottom ratio.
The mean of each attribute differs around 10 to 15 percent in each case between rich and poor
countries, except altitude where rich countries have 42 percent the mean altitude of poor countries
and temperature with rich countries having about half the mean temperatures of poor countries. To
put things in perspective, compare the rich-poor ratio (column 3) to the top-bottom ratio (column

6). The variation in mean attributes across rich and poor countries is considerably more compressed
compared to the variation across the world in each attribute regardless of income. For instance,
the average altitude, precipitation, and temperature between the countries at the top and bottom
deciles in each case is a factor difference of more than 10-fold, whereas fertility, depth and slope
a factor of more than 2.5-fold. As a result the unconditional cross-country variation dwarfs the
rich-poor variation in each of the attributes.
We also note that even though there is considerable dispersion of land quality and geographic
attributes across the globe, there is also considerable heterogeneity observed even within countries.
Interestingly though, the internal dispersion of land quality attributes within rich and poor countries
is also not systematically different. For example, the mean of the standard deviations of soil fertility
is 1.12 in rich countries whereas it is 1.02 in poor countries.
To summarize, we find some variation between rich and poor countries in terms of soil, terrain, and

climate attributes, but the variation is very small when compared to the variation in each attribute
across the world. Nevertheless, what matters for aggregate agricultural productivity is how the
dispersion in geographical attributes translates into differences in productivity across countries.
We note that agricultural productivity is the result of all geographical conditions combined and
differences in a single attribute may not matter as much. For instance, it may be that substantial
variation in a given geographical attribute only translates into minor differences in productivity
across countries. We are interested in whether all these geographic attributes taken together contribute to systematically different growing conditions across countries and whether these differences
account for a substantial portion of the observed productivity gaps. For this reason, in the next
section we work with potential yields by plot and crop, as a summary measure of how dispersion
in geographical attributes translates into productivity differences—a measure of TFP in this context since potential yields control for the level of farm inputs such as water and farming practice

Accounting Framework
The Primitives

We consider a world that comprises a fixed number of administrative units indexed by u ∈ U ≡
{1, 2, ..., U }. These units are countries in our analysis but in general could be lower administrative
units within a country such as provinces, states, or counties. Each administrative unit u comprises
a finite number Gu of grid cells (or pixels) of fixed size—in the GAEZ data the grid cell resolution
is 5 arc-minutes.12 We index grid cells by g ∈ Gu ≡ {1, 2, ..., Gu }. Cells can be aggregated up to
various levels of administrative units (regions, countries, states, counties etc.) using a mapping of
cells to administrative boundaries in ArcGIS. Each grid cell can produce any of C crops, indexed
by c ∈ C ≡ {1, 2, ..., C}.
Cells are heterogeneous with respect to their land characteristics and as a result differ in the
productivity of the land across crops. In particular, a key object reported in the GAEZ data is the
potential yield or land productivity (tonnes per hectare) of each cell if it were to produce crop c.
c
We denote the potential yield from producing crop c in grid cell g in unit u by ẑgu
. Note that for

each cell g in unit u there are C such numbers, each of which reflects the inherent productivity of
that cell in producing crop c.
In practice, the land in each cell can be used for crop production or some other activity (could be
agricultural such as raising livestock or non-agricultural, or some other land cover category). If a
portion of the land in a cell is used for crop production, it may produce one or several specific crops

As discussed earlier, note that while the size of a cell in arc-minutes is constant, it is not constant in terms of
hectares as the mapping from arc-minutes to hectares depends on the distance of the cell from the equator.

which may differ from the crops in which the cell has the highest potential yield. We denote by
c
ygu
the real output (in tonnes) and by `cgu the amount of cultivated land in hectares of crop c, cell
c
the actual yield which is just the ratio of real output to land,
g, and unit u. We denote by zgu
c
c
/`cgu . For the purpose of aggregation, in any unit u and cell g, we set the amount of output
= ygu
zgu

and land used to zero if there is no production of a given crop c.
Similarly for the purpose of aggregation of different crops in a location we denote by pc the international price of each crop which we treat as common across space and countries. Note also that
the size of each vector is C × 1, corresponding to the total number of crops in the GAEZ project
which is 18 crops. In each cell g all the vectors have non-zero elements only for the crops actually
produced. The only vectors that have all non-zero elements for every crop are the potential yield
and the common international price. The potential yield vector is specific to each cell g and unit u.

3.2

Aggregate Variables

We denote with upper case letters aggregate variables. There are different levels of aggregation that
are of interest but for the purpose of illustration we focus on aggregating to the administrative unit
level (country). We denote by Lu the amount of land used in agricultural production, given by,

Lu =

XX

`cgu .

c∈C g∈Gu

We denote by Yu the amount of real agricultural output produced, given by,

Yu =

XX
c∈C g∈Gu

19

c
pc ygu
,

Given these aggregates, we define the actual aggregate yield Zu by the ratio of aggregate real output
to land used, that is,

The aggregate yield is a weighted average of the yields in every crop and location in a given country.
Equation (1) is the key equation in our accounting analysis as it provides the basis for assessing the
key determinants of low agricultural productivity in poor countries, that is, whether the differences
c

in aggregate yields arise from low actual yields of each crop in each location (i.e., low zgu

not producing in the highest yielding locations across space, or from the low yielding crop mix in
each location.

3.3

Counterfactuals

We construct a set of counterfactuals on aggregate potential yields for each administrative unit u
by exploiting the set of potential yields by crop at the cell level g and the spatial distribution of
production by crop across cells.

Production efficiency The main counterfactual is to assess the impact on the aggregate yield
gap between rich and poor countries of producing at the potential yield for each crop and each
location. This counterfactual can be understood in equation (1) by simply replacing the actual
c
c
yield zgu
for each crop for each cell by its potential counterpart ẑgu
—highest attainable TFP given

water and farming inputs. Hence, in this counterfactual only the yield changes, while the weights
represented by the share of cultivated land of a crop in each location are kept constant `cgu /Lu . The

20

aggregate yield in this counterfactual is defined as,

Zucf

=

XX
c∈C g∈Gu

`c
c c gu
p ẑgu .
Lu

If the cross-country differences in the actual yield are similar under the production efficiency counterfactual, then production efficiency at the crop/location level is not an important determinant of
the actual yield differences. But if instead, the cross-country differences under production efficiency
are negligible then geography and land quality are not important determinants of actual yield gaps
across rich and poor countries.

Spatial efficiency We assess the extent to which reallocation of agricultural production of the
different crops to the most productive locations across space can raise aggregate output. This counterfactual combines production efficiency with a reallocation of crops across space. In particular,
we re-allocate production so that each crop is produced in the cells where it realizes the highest
potential yields, keeping constant the amount of cultivated land for that crop in the country to
P
the actual level, i.e., Lcu = g∈Gu `cgu . This allocation problem is non-trivial. Some cells within a
country may exhibit higher potential productivity for all crops, while the amount of land that can
be allocated to a given crop is limited. How will crops be reallocated to cells? We reallocate the
production of crops to cells according to comparative advantage in potential yields of the different
crops, i.e., where the relative potential return for each crop is the highest. Formally, this involves
solving a large-scale linear programming problem for each country, given by,

c = 1, 2, ...C;

(4)

g∈Gu

`cgu ≥ 0,

g = 1, 2, ...Gu ;

c = 1, 2, ...C.

(5)

The objective is to maximize the total amount of output across all cells and crops, subject to three
sets of constraints. The first set of constraints restricts that land allocated to the production of the
different crops cannot exceed what is available in each cell. The second set of constraints indicates
that land allocated to crop c over all cells cannot exceed the total in the data. The third set of
constraints allows for the possibility that not all crops are produced in all cells.

Total efficiency The last counterfactual is to assess the extent to which countries may not be
producing the highest yielding mix of crops in each location given their land endowment characteristics. This counterfactual involves computing the aggregate yield in each country by picking the
crop in each location that maximizes output. Formally, we solve for `gu in equation (2) subject
to only the first and third set of constraints, that is equations (3) and (5). This counterfactual
involves production efficiency, reallocation of crops across space, and changes in crop choices in
order to maximize aggregate output—the allocation that generates the maximum attainable output in each country given the total amount of land. The difference between this counterfactual
and the production efficiency counterfactual represents the contribution to the aggregate yield of
crop-mix choices and the spatial reallocation of production, whereas the difference with the spatial
reallocation is the contribution of crop choice changes to the aggregate yield.

Results

Using cell-specific production and land use data by crop within countries we calculate for each country aggregate output per hectare (actual yield) using FAO international crop prices (Geary-Khamis
dollars per tonne) for the year 2000. In Figure 6 we plot for 162 countries the actual aggregate
22

yield against real GDP per capita, both in logs. The actual aggregate yield varies systematically
with the level of development, with the correlation in logs being 0.58. The richest decile countries
have an average yield that is 3.1 times higher than the average in the poorest decile countries in

our sample.

Figure 6: Actual Aggregate Yield across Countries

To what extent are these yield differences the result of differences in land quality and geography
across rich and poor countries? We now address this question using our spatial accounting framework, through the set of counterfactual experiments outlined in Section 3.3.

Production efficiency We ask what the aggregate yield within each country would be if in
each cell and for each current crop, output was produced according to its potential yield—highest
attainable TFP given water and farming inputs—rather than its actual yield, holding the set of crops
and the allocation of land across crops fixed to their actual values? We call the constructed yield
for each country the potential aggregate yield. Figure 7 documents the potential aggregate yield for
23

each country by real GDP per capita. While there is substantial variation in potential aggregate
yields across countries—the ratio of the top to bottom deciles in the potential yield distribution
is a factor of 3—the differences are not systematically related to the level of development. For
example, the disparity in the potential aggregate yield between Senegal and Tajikistan, two low
income countries, is roughly the same as the potential aggregate yield disparity between Finland and
the Netherlands, two high income countries. Unlike the actual aggregate yields, Figure 7 illustrates
that there is only a slight positive relationship between potential aggregate yields and GDP per

Figure 7: Potential Aggregate Yield across Countries

We now focus attention on the differences between rich and poor countries. In Panel A of Table 2,
we report the results of the production efficiency counterfactual for the average of the richest decile
of countries, the average of the poorest decile countries, and their ratio. The first column reports the
actual aggregate yield, the second column the potential aggregate yield, and the third column the
yield ratio between the potential to actual for each group of countries. Panel B reports the results
24

for cereal crops only. The results are striking. Production efficiency would increase the aggregate
yield in all countries but much more so in poor relative to rich countries—compared to actual yields,
the potential yield is only 65 percent higher in rich countries whereas it is 393 percent higher in
poor countries. In other words, if countries produced the crops they are producing in the cells they
are actually producing them but according to the their potential yields, then the aggregate yield
disparity between rich and poor countries would drop from the actual 3.14-fold to only 1.05-fold,
that is the productivity disparity would virtually disappear. A similar result arises for the subgroup
of cereal crops which covers a set of crops produced in most countries of the world such as wheat,
rice, maize, sorghum, millet, and others, in Panel B of Table 2. Although the magnitude difference
of the actual aggregate yield is larger for this subgroup of crops (4.6-fold vs. 3.1 for all crops), the
potential disparity is once again substantially reduced to 24 percent (versus 5 percent for all crops),
echoing a similar message.
We have used a common set of crop prices to aggregate yields in all locations and countries, however,
the conclusions from the production efficiency counterfactual remain when focusing on individual
crops for which we only use the physical measure of productivity. Table 3 reports the production
efficiency counterfactual for each of the three most representative crops produced across the world:
wheat, rice, and maize; where the yield is measured as output in tonnes per unit of land, a physical
measure of productivity. The rich-poor disparity in the actual yield differs across crops with 6.53fold and 5.11-fold disparities for maize and rice but only 2.53-fold disparity for wheat. Producing
these crops according to potential yields would reduce the rich-poor ratio to 1.60-fold in the case
of maize and 1.22-fold in the case of rice. In the case of wheat the rich-poor disparity drops to
0.86-fold. Despite these differences across individual crops, the main message remains the same:
poor countries are producing much further away from their potential yield than rich countries, and
if all countries produced at their potential the rich-poor yield gap would be all but eliminated.
These results point to low efficiency in producing each crop in each cell as a key factor for the

agricultural productivity differences between rich and poor countries, rather than differences in
land quality.
The pattern of our results is not specific to rich and poor countries. Figure 8 documents the yield
ratio—the ratio of potential to actual aggregate yield—against real GDP per capita in logs for the
entire set of countries in our sample. As is clear, the yield ratio is indeed systematically negatively
correlated with the level of development, with a correlation coefficient of -0.64 in logs. That is,
conditioning on the set of crops each country produces on each plot, developing countries produce
much further away from their potential than developed countries.
We find that poor countries not only have on average larger potential to actual aggregate yield ratios
but also higher dispersion in yield ratios across cells within a country compared to rich countries,

Figure 8: Potential to Actual Aggregate Yield Ratio across Countries

Figure 9 documents the standard deviation of (log) potential to actual yield ratios across locations
in each country against the level of income per capita.

Spatial efficiency A fact of poor and developing countries is the prevalence of large rural populations, often operating at subsistence levels and that face poor infrastructure, conditions that may
lead farmers to produce crops that are not necessarily suitable to the geographical characteristics
of the land they operate, see for instance Adamopoulos (2011), Gollin and Rogerson (2014), and
Adamopoulos and Restuccia (2014). To assess the relevance of reallocation across space we ask:
How would the aggregate yield change if we reallocated the production of individual crops across
cultivated cells according to where they exhibit the highest relative yield in the country, holding
the total land allocated to each crop in the country at its actual level?
Table 4 reports the results of this counterfactual. Spatial reallocation has a positive effect on
aggregate output, with an increase of around 20 percent, but the magnitude of the effect is similar

Figure 9: Within-Country Dispersion of log Potential to Actual Yield Ratio across Cells

among rich and poor countries and, as a result, spatial reallocation does not help reduce the
aggregate productivity ratio between rich and poor countries beyond the potential efficiency effect.

Total efficiency With this counterfactual we ask, how would the aggregate yield change if in each
cell in each country the highest yielding crop was produced, holding the amount of cultivated land
in each plot constant? This experiment allows us to construct for each country a counterfactual
potential aggregate yield that reflects the potential yield for each crop and cell as well as the output
maximizing crop choice in each cell. Countries produce in each cell the crop that yields the highest
return, given their local growing conditions and the (international) relative prices of crops.
Table 5 reports the results of this counterfactual for all crops. If countries shift their crop mix to
the highest yielding crops, cell-by-cell, then the aggregate yield disparity between rich and poor
countries would drop from the actual 3.14-fold to 0.77-fold. In other words, by adjusting the crop
mix to the most suitable given their geographic characteristics, poor countries would be about 30

Notes: Rich and Poor refer to the highest and lowest decile of the world income distribution. “Spatial” refers to the
counterfactual yield under the “Spatial Efficiency” experiment. Each country-level yield is constructed by aggregating
up from the GAEZ pixel-level information at the 5 arc-minute resolution (roughly 10-by-10 km). Potential and spatial
yields assume rain-fed and irrigated water supply, and mixed level of input use for every pixel.

percent more productive than rich countries.
Figure 10 shows that the total efficiency yield is essentially flat across the income distribution, with
a correlation coefficient in logs of 0. Figure 11 documents the ratio of the total efficiency yield
to the potential yield indicating a slight negative slope indicating that the spatial-crop mix choice
generates higher productivity gains in poor compared to rich countries.
To quantify the contribution of production efficiency versus changes in the crop mix choice, we note
that the reduction of the actual yield gap from 3.14-fold to 0.77-fold arises from a reduction of the
actual yield gap from 3.14 to 1.05 from production efficiency and then to 0.77 from the crop mix

This counterfactual points to poor countries producing systematically lower yielding crops given
their internal land quality characteristics.

Robustness

We examine the sensitivity of our main results to: (a) aggregating crops by weighing them according to their caloric content rather than using FAO international prices; (b) using instead of
potential yields, agro-climatic yields that abstract from soil and terrain constraints; (c) alternative
assumptions about the level of farming inputs; and, (d) alternative assumptions about the water
supply.

32

Caloric Content of Crops In developing countries, a large proportion of farmers consume most
of the output they produce as the amount of produced output is close to subsistence levels. For these
farmers, the caloric intake from the different crops may be more relevant than international prices
for the evaluation of the different crops. To examine the robustness of our benchmark results that
use international prices from the FAO, we consider an alternative of aggregating crops (in actual
and potential yields) by their caloric content. Tables (6) and (7) report the average actual and
counterfactual yields by income group for production efficiency and total efficiency counterfactuals
respectively, with Panel A documenting the results using caloric content and Panel B documenting
the corresponding benchmark results with international prices for comparison. The caloric content,
measured in kilo calories (kcal) per 100g, are obtained from the USDA’s National Nutrient Database
for Standard Reference (Release 28).
We find that the main conclusions of our benchmark results remain intact: there are substantial
differences in actual yields across countries (3.14 in benchmark, 3.57 with calorie “prices”); producing existing crops according to potential yields removes the vast majority of the cross-country
aggregate yield differences (1.05 in benchmark, 1.24 with calorie “prices”); and allowing for crop
mix and location to change reverses the aggregate yields difference between rich and poor countries
(0.77 in benchmark, 0.75 with calorie “prices”).

Agro-climatic Potential Yields GAEZ calculates in each grid cell agro-climatic yields by crop,
that measure potential biomass yield. These are the yield potentials that can be achieved taking
into account temperature, radiation and moisture regimes of each grid cell, and specific growing
requirements of each crop. Agro-climatic crop yields do not take into account soil or terrain constraints that can reduce potential yields. In Figure 12 we plot the aggregate counterfactual yield
for each country against GDP per capita (both in logs), if countries were to produce each crop in
each cell according to the crop-cell-country agro-climatic yield. The reported counterfactual yield
is computed under rain-fed water conditions and intermediate level of inputs-management for each

Notes: Rich and Poor refer to the highest and lowest decile of the world income distribution, where income is Real

per hectare in international prices (GK $/ha), while in Panel B they are measured as energy (000s of kcal) per hectare.
Calorie “prices” (kcal per 100 grams) are obtained from USDA, National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference
(Release 28). Each country-level yield is constructed by aggregating up from the GAEZ pixel-level information at
the 5 arc-minute resolution (roughly 10-by-10 km). Potential yield assumes mixed level of input use for every pixel.
The yield gap refers to the ratio of potential to actual yield.

cell in each country. This serves as a robustness to the “Production Efficiency” experiment, where
in the benchmark counterfactual the potential yield for each crop-cell-country used was under both
rain-fed and irrigated water supply conditions, and under mixed level of inputs-management. The
conclusion drawn from the benchmark counterfactual for “Production Efficiency” is robust to using
agro-climatic yields. The aggregate potential yield is flat with respect to income per capita. Egypt
and countries of the Arabian peninsula stand out as outliers due to large desert areas, which are
particularly arid under pure rain-fed water conditions.

Effect of Assumed Input Level In the benchmark counterfactual of “Production Efficiency,” we
compute the potential aggregate yield for each country when each crop-cell-country yield is produced

according to potential yields, holding constant across all countries, water supply conditions to rainfed and irrigated and inputs-management to mixed level. We evaluate the sensitivity of our results
of potential yield across countries using different assumptions about input levels. Recall that an
important element in the cross-country comparisons we make is that the level of inputs is kept the
same in all countries, so the differences in the potential yields for each crop and location reflect
only variation in the geographical attributes of the land in each location. But it may be that the
geographical endowments in poor countries are less conducive to the use of certain inputs and if so
using the mixed level of inputs in our baseline may bias our results.
In Figure 13 we show the effect on aggregate potential (counterfactual) yields of altering the assumption of inputs used for all countries. The top panel shows the potential aggregate yield across

countries under the intermediate level of inputs (and rain-fed conditions), and the bottom panel
under the high level of inputs (and rain-fed conditions). The main conclusion from the benchmark
experiment regarding the lack of systematic correlation between the potential aggregate yield and
GDP per capita remains intact, under the assumption of either intermediate or high input levels.
The outliers of Egypt and countries of the Arabian peninsula remain, just as under the agro-climatic
yields (since water supply conditions are rain-fed in all of these cases).
Next, we calculate the aggregate potential yield in each country for the three most prevalent crops
across the world, wheat, maize, and rice, for each available level of inputs in the GAEZ database,
namely low, intermediate, and high, under rain-fed conditions. We report in Figure 14 the ratio of
potential yields with high inputs to low inputs in the left panel and for the ratio of high inputs to
intermediate inputs in the right panel. Panel A in Figure 14 reports the ratio of potential yields
for wheat, Panel B for maize and Panel C for rice. While there are changes between potential
aggregate yields with different input levels within countries, these changes are not systematically

correlated with income. The main take-away from Figure 14 is that our main finding of a weak
relationship between potential yields and real GDP per capita across countries is present under
alternative input-level assumptions.

Effect of Assumed Water Supply Conditions In Figure 15 we show the effect of water supply
conditions on the relationship of the potential aggregate yield for cereals and output per capita.
In the top panel, we keep water supply conditions constant to rain-fed for each crop-cell-country
(and intermediate level of inputs-management), and in the bottom panel we keep them constant
to irrigated for each crop-cell-country (and intermediate level of inputs-management). The main
conclusion of no relationship between potential aggregate yields and income levels across countries
remains the same. The difference between the two panels of Figure 15 is that under rain-fed water
supply conditions there are the outliers of Egypt and countries of the Arabian peninsula, just as
under the agro-climatic yields. The second panel shows, that while having in place irrigation can
partially alleviate the extreme dry conditions in parts of these countries, there is still no relationship
of potential aggregate yields and income across countries.

Conclusions

That land quality and geography matter for agricultural production at the micro-level is ubiquitous
as argued by both agronomists (e.g, Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979; Steduto et al., 2012, GAEZ)
and agricultural economists (e.g., Sherlund et al., 2002; Di Falco and Chavas, 2009; Fuwa et al.,
2007; Jaenicke and Lengnick, 1999). Using detailed micro-geography data, in this paper we quantify
the macro-level consequences of land quality for agricultural productivity, measured as output per
hectare (yield). In particular, we examine to what extent differences in agricultural yields across
countries are the result of natural advantages/disadvantages or the result of economic choices. We
find that land quality differences cannot justify the agricultural productivity gaps between rich

and poor countries. If farming practices were the same around the world then land quality would
not be a constraint on farmers in poor countries. Instead we trace the problem to what crops are
produced, where they are produced within the country, and most importantly how efficiently they
are produced in each cell of land.
Our analysis illustrates that there are large gaps between actual and potential yields in poor countries, much larger than in rich countries. The implication is that using existing technologies and
improving allocations can increase agricultural productivity 5-fold. These seem like sizeable unrealized gains in productivity. One possibility is that the technologies agronomists treat as easily
localized (in the calculation of potential yields) cannot be profitably implemented everywhere in
the developing world. The other possibility is that there are constraints that prevent the adoption
of modern technologies and frictions that prevent markets from efficiently allocating resources in
developing countries. More work is needed to understand the importance of each one of these explanations. While a large body of recent work has been studying the constraints and frictions that
impact agricultural productivity, with mounting evidence of their importance, much less work has
been done on understanding the localization of agricultural technologies in developing countries.
GAEZ has been following a variety of approaches for “ground-truthing” and verifying the results
of their crop suitability analysis, but more needs to be done in terms of further validation. At
the same time further research is needed to understand what factors constrain the choices of farmers in the developing world, preventing them from better exploiting their land and environmental
endowments.
