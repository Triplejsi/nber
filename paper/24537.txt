Inequality of Educational Opportunity? Schools as Mediators of the Intergenerational Transmission
of Income

NBER Working Paper No. 24537
April 2018
JEL No. I24,I3,J12,J24
ABSTRACT
Chetty et al. (2014b) show that children from low-income families achieve higher adult incomes,
relative to those from higher income families, in some commuting zones (CZs) than in others. I
investigate whether children’s educational outcomes help to explain the between-CZ differences.
I find little evidence that the quality of schools is a key mechanism driving variation in
intergenerational mobility. While CZs with stronger intergenerational income transmission have
somewhat stronger transmission of parental income to children’s educational attainment and
achievement, on average, neither can explain a large share of the between-CZ variation. Marriage
patterns explain two-fifths of the variation in income transmission, human capital accumulation
and returns to human capital each explain only one-ninth, and the remainder of the variation
(about one-third) reflects differences in earnings between children from high- and low-income
families that are not mediated by human capital. This points to job networks and the structure of
local labor and marriage markets, rather than the education system, as likely factors influencing
intergenerational economic mobility.

Introduction

Chetty et al. (2014a, hereafter "CHKS") use data on the universe of U.S. tax filers to measure
intergenerational income transmission – the strength of the association between parents’ and
children’s incomes – at the fine geographic level, and reveal massive heterogeneity across
space: The gap in adult earnings between children from high- vs. low-income families is
nearly twice as large for children who grow up in Cincinnati as for those who grow up in
Los Angeles. Little is known, however, about the mechanisms driving this variation.
There are many potential channels for intergenerational transmission, including diﬀerences in parenting practices between high- and low-income families, diﬀerences in explicit
investments in children’s education, diﬀerences in access to educational or other public institutions, and labor market institutions (such as insider hiring or spatial mismatch) that
advantage children from high-income families regardless of their skills. These suggest quite
diﬀerent directions to look for potential policy interventions aimed at reducing transmission.
CHKS find that income transmission is negatively correlated with average test scores,
high school completion, and school expenditures, and uncorrelated to average class size.
This is suggestive, but these aggregate correlations are of limited value to understanding
the mechanisms driving the variation across CZs. Income transmission is about diﬀerential
outcomes of children from high- and low-income families, so to understand the mechanisms
driving the between-area variation we need to understand how areas vary in the relative
inputs received by and outcomes obtained by children from families with diﬀerent incomes.
I investigate this directly, focusing on human capital accumulation as a potential mediator of intergenerational income transmission. If variation in school quality, or in parenting
practices related to learning, is an important factor driving the variation in income transmission, we would expect that high income transmission areas would also be areas where the
gap in educational outcomes between children from high- and low-income families is large.
On the other hand, if parental income primarily helps children by, for example, buying them
access to better labor market networks, then areas where poor children have good adult
outcomes will not, in general, be areas where they do relatively well in school.
To measure children’s educational outcomes, I rely primarily on the Education Longi-

2

tudinal Survey (ELS). This is a representative national sample that includes information
about parental income, children’s achievement (test scores) near the end of high school,
and educational attainment and early adult earnings and income. The ELS data can be
geocoded to commuting zones (CZs), the unit of geography considered by CHKS.
The ELS contains only about 15,000 respondents, far too few to produce reliable incomeachievement transmission measures for each of the 700 CZs in the United States. I show
that this is not necessary in order to accomplish the more limited goal of measuring the
across-CZ association between income-income transmission and income-achievement transmission. That association is identified even with small numbers of observations from each
CZ – information can be pooled from many CZs with similar income-income transmission
to identify the average income-achievement transmission among them, even when the latter is not reliably estimated for any individual CZ. I develop an estimator for the slope
of the CZ-level regression of intergenerational income transmission on income-achievement
transmission, or for the correlation between the two, based on a mixed (random coeﬃcients)
model for the relationship between children’s achievement and their parents’ incomes.
I find that CZs vary substantially in the strength of transmission from parental income
to children’s 12th grade math scores (which I call “test score transmission”), but that this
is only weakly correlated across CZs with income transmission. Income transmission is
more strongly correlated to the strength of transmission from parental income to children’s
educational attainment,1 though the magnitude of the variation in the latter is not large
enough to account for a large share of the former. These results suggest that diﬀerential
inequities in access to good schools are not an important mechanism driving the across-CZ
variation in income transmission; what role education does play seems to reflect access to
higher education more than the quality of elementary and secondary schools.
This motivates me to consider other channels for intergenerational income transmission
that may vary across CZs. One is the labor market return to skill. In every CZ, children
from low-income families obtain less human capital than do children from higher income
1
This reproduces a CHKS result for college enrollment, discussed below. Another similar result comes
from Kearney and Levine (2016), who find that high school dropout gaps by family status are stronger in
more unequal states (which tend to have stronger income transmission). Kearney and Levine (2014) find
that non-marital childbearing is more common among low-SES women in these states as well.

families. As a result, diﬀerences in the return to human capital could drive diﬀerences
in income transmission even if the skill acquisition technology were the same everywhere.
Indeed, I find that the return to education varies substantially across CZs, and explains as
much of the variation in income transmission as do achievement and attainment gradients
together. This points to labor market institutions as a potentially important factor.
I develop a decomposition that allows me to apportion the variation in CZ-level income
transmission into four components: Accumulation of human capital, the earnings returns
to human capital, the residual component of earnings that is explained by parental income
conditional on the child’s measured human capital, and non-earnings components of the
child’s family income (including spousal earnings and any non-labor income). I find that
the final component, spousal and unearned income, accounts for two-fifths of the relative
advantage of children from high-income families in high-transmission CZs. This reflects
diﬀerences in the likelihood of marriage or in the age of marriage rather than assortative
matching or inheritances. Another one-third operates through children’s residual earnings.
Skill accumulation and the return to skill each represents only one-ninth of the total.
My analysis is purely observational; my estimates of the association between CZ-level
income transmission and CZ-level transmission of parental income to children’s test scores
and other outcomes could be confounded by other CZ-level characteristics that are correlated with both. Keeping this caveat in mind, my results indicate that human capital plays
a relatively small role in the geographic variation in the intergenerational transmission of
income. Much of this variation appears to reflect diﬀerences in adult earnings of children
with similar skills, perhaps due to labor market institutions (e.g., unions, or other determinants of residual income inequality) or diﬀerences in access to good jobs (due, perhaps,
to labor market networks or socially stratified labor markets). An even larger component
is due to the use of family income-based (rather than individual earnings-based) measures
of income transmission. This may be spurious, as diﬀerences in the likelihood of having
spousal earnings, across income levels and across CZs, may simply reflect variation in age at
marriage rather than true diﬀerences in opportunity across CZs, and may not be indicative
of children’s economic success.
My results on the mechanisms driving the existing variation in income transmission do
4

not translate directly into policy implications. It may be possible to increase opportunity
through educational interventions even though education is not a primary channel explaining diﬀerences in current opportunity. Nevertheless, my results suggest that the space of
policies worthy of consideration should be broader than this. Policies related to labor market
opportunity and outcomes may be more important, and merit at least as much attention.

Data

My analysis combines two sources of information: Measured income transmission at the CZ
level, from CHKS’s analysis of tax data, and survey data with information about parental
income and children’s human capital attainment. I discuss these in turn.

2.1

Intergenerational income transmission

CHKS discuss several ways of defining intergenerational mobility. I focus on what they call
“relative mobility,” the advantage that a child from a high-income family has, relative to
a child from a low-income family in the same CZ, in achieving a high income as an adult.
CHKS study children born between 1980 and 1982 and measure the income of child i in CZ
c, yic , as the average family income, including any spousal earnings and non-labor income,
in 2011 and 2012, when the child is between 29 and 32. Children are linked to parents
who claimed them as dependents in their late teens, and CHKS define pic as the average
parental family income – measured as the adjusted gross income plus tax-exempt interest
and non-taxable Social Security benefits – for the parent(s) of child i in 1996 through 2000.
Both children’s and parents’ incomes are scaled as national percentile ranks in the relevant
distributions, without adjustment for family size or the number of earners. Children are
assigned to the CZ where their parents filed taxes in 1996, when the children were 14 to 16
years old.
CHKS define relative mobility in CZ c as the coeﬃcient ✓c from a bivariate regression:

yic = ↵c + pic ✓c + eic .

5

(1)

Higher values of ✓c correspond to less mobility across generations, and I refer hereafter to ✓c
as the strength of income transmission in the CZ. Universe tax data allows CHKS to estimate
✓c extremely precisely at the CZ level. They find that ✓c = 0.43 in Cincinnati, meaning that
a one percentile diﬀerence in parental income is associated with a 0.43 percentile diﬀerence
in children’s eventual income, on average, in that city, and that in Los Angeles ✓c = 0.23,
implying a relationship between parent and child income that is only a bit more than half
as strong as in Cincinnati.
Table 1 presents unweighted summary statistics for ✓c , extracted from CHKS’s online
data tables. The average of 0.33 indicates that in the average CZ, each one percentile
increase in parental income is associated with one-third of a percentile increase in children’s
income. But the standard deviation of ✓c across CZs is 0.065. In 71 CZs, ✓c is less than
0.24, indicating parent income-child income relationships about one-quarter weaker than the
average, while another 78 CZs have ✓c > 0.40, about one-quarter larger than average. Among
the 100 largest CZs, Santa Barbara has the weakest income transmission, and Cincinnati
the strongest.

2.2

Survey data

To measure the transmission of parental income to children’s human capital accumulation,
I use the Educational Longitudinal Study (ELS; Ingels et al., 2014a). This is a nationally
representative, longitudinal sample of just over 19,000 10th graders in 2002, corresponding
roughly to the 1985-1986 birth cohorts. Respondents were followed through 2012, when they
were roughly 26. Math and reading scores are available in 10th grade, and math scores in
12th grade. I also construct children’s adult income, yic , as their self-reported 2011 family
income (including spousal earnings and non-labor income), when they were 25 or 26 years
old. I assign students to CZs based on their residential zip codes in the base year survey,
using information from subsequent surveys when this is missing.
I supplement the ELS with two similar panels. The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study,
Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K; Tourangeau et al., 2009) sampled kindergarteners in 1998-9
and followed them through 8th grade in 2007. Students are assigned to CZs based on their

6

8th grade residences.2 The High School Longitudinal Study (HSLS; Ingels et al., 2014b)
provides high school test scores for children born in roughly 1994-1995. I assign them to the
CZs they lived in during high school.
There are three major limitations of these samples for my purposes. Most importantly,
sample sizes are well under 100 per CZ. Moreover, the surveys each use multi-stage sampling
designs, with schools as one stage and then relatively large samples of students within each
school.3 This means that within-CZ heterogeneity is even more limited than the small
sample sizes imply. A consequence is that it is necessary to pool information across CZs
in order to obtain any precision at all about the relationship between parental income and
later outcomes (Gelman and Hill, 2006).
Second, none of the samples covers CHKS’s 1980-82 birth cohorts. If income or test
score transmission changed across cohorts, between-cohort comparisons may understate the
relationship between the two. I explore sensitivity to this misalignment in two ways. First,
I compare across the NCES samples, which diﬀer in their distance from CHKS’s cohorts.
Results are quite similar, suggesting that between-cohort changes are not particularly important for my analysis.4 Second, the appendix presents results that use two alternative
measures of income transmission, one from CHKS for the 1983-85 birth cohorts – very close
to the ELS cohorts – and one from Chetty and Hendren’s (forthcoming) mobility-based
estimate based on children born between 1980 and 1991. None of the results presented here
diﬀer meaningfully when either alternative is used.
A final important limitation is that, while all three studies included parental surveys, the
parental income measures are extremely limited. The ELS collects only total family income,
and only in the base year. The measure is categorical, with 13 bins (e.g., one corresponds
to incomes between $25,000 and $35,000). The HSLS collected family income twice, and
reports it continuously. The ECLS data include a continuous measure in Kindergarten and
2
Where 8th grade residences are unavailable, I use the location of the 8th grade school, then the 5th
grade residence and school, then 3rd grade, and so on.
3
The regressions below account for CZ-level (or within-CZ) clustering, but do not otherwise adjust for the
survey designs. Most of my estimates are unweighted, but results are generally robust to using student-level
sampling weights when specifications permit it.
4
Chetty et al. (2014b) find that national aggregate relative mobility has been quite stable across a range
of birth cohorts (born 1971-1993), but CZ-level measures might in principle vary across cohorts with little
variation in the national aggregate. See also Aaronson and Mazumder (2008).

7

categorical measures in 1st and 3rd grades.5
I also present an analysis of returns to education in American Community Survey (ACS)
data. For maximum comparability with CHKS’s measures, I use the 2010, 2011, and 2012
one-year public use microdata samples, and focus on the 253,852 individuals in these samples
born between 1980 and 1982. I convert annual family incomes to percentiles within the ACS
sample distribution. I do not have information about where respondents lived as children,
so I assign them to the CZ where they live at the time of the survey.
Summary statistics for the four microdata samples are reported in Table 2.6 Following
CHKS, my primary analysis converts incomes, earnings, and test scores to percentiles within
the relevant samples; these have mean 50.0 and standard deviation 28.9 by construction. For
parental income, I assign ELS categories to the midpoints of the national percentile range
they span; in the HSLS and ECLS, I average incomes across the available waves, using bin
midpoints as necessary, and construct percentiles of the distribution of averages. There is
surely non-classical measurement error in each of the measures when scaled as percentiles.7
There is no reason to expect the resulting bias to diﬀer across CZs or across dependent variables, however. Appendix Figure A1 shows that percentile-percentile relationships between
parental income and various children’s outcomes are roughly linear in the ELS sample. Appendix Table A7 presents results that use alternative scales for parental income and child
test scores.
Table 2 shows that 84% of ELS respondents report ever having attended a postsecondary
educational institution by the age-26 survey. This is much higher than the 53% reporting
some college or more in the ACS sample. In CHKS’s tax data, 60% of children are recorded
as attending college between 18 and 21. Only half of the college attenders in the ELS sample
5
I can assess the reliability of individual binned measures by comparing the same family’s income across
the three ECLS waves. As discussed below, I scale incomes as percentiles of the sample distribution.
Percentiles constructed from the 1st and 3rd grade wave bin midpoints are correlated 0.84; the Kindergarten
percentile is correlated 0.86 and 0.80 with the 1st and 3rd grade measures, respectively. A percentile
constructed from the average of the three is correlated 0.94-0.95 with the individual measures.
6
Mean parental incomes vary across samples. This in part reflects inflation (I report nominal values) and
life cycle considerations (ECLS parents are on average younger when their incomes are collected than ELS
or HSLS parents).
7
The ELS test scores – in math and reading in 10th grade, and in math in 12th grade – are point estimates
of student proficiency from an Item Response Theory (IRT) model. Measurement error does not bias student
performance on the original IRT scale, but will tend to compress gaps between groups on the percentile scale
(Jacob and Rothstein, 2016). This likely attenuates my estimates of income-to-achievement transmission,
but should not bias the between-CZ comparisons that are my primary interest.

earned a college degree; in the ACS, the share without a degree is under 30%. It appears
that the ELS is counting some respondents with weak postsecondary attachment as having
attended college who would not be so counted in other data sets. I discuss this further
below.

Conceptual framework and empirical strategy

Subsection 3.1 lays out a simple model in which human capital mediates the relationship
between parent and child income. Subsection 3.2 develops a methodology for estimating
the key elements of the model – and in particular how they vary across CZs – with the
limited available data. Subsection 3.3 describes a decomposition of the across-CZ variation
in income transmission into various component mechanisms.

3.1

Children’s human capital as a mediator of intergenerational income
transmission

Let sic be a potential mediator of the relationship between parental income pic and children’s
income yic , such as the child’s educational attainment or achievement. Its importance as a
mediator depends on the strength of its relationship to pic , and on the extent to which it
accounts to the relationship between pic and yic . Assuming linear and additive relationships,
we have a simple system:
sic = ↵ + pic ⇡ + uic

(2)

yic =  + sic + pic µ + vic .

(3)

and

These equations represent reduced-form transmission and are statistical projections, not
causal models. The system is illustrated in Figure 1. The coeﬃcient ⇡ represents the
importance of parental income as a determinant of sic .

is the return to sic in children’s

incomes, while µ is the “direct” eﬀect of parental income on children’s income, not mediated
by sic .

9

Plugging (2) into (3) and rearranging, we obtain:

yic = ( + ↵ ) + pic (⇡ + µ) + (uic + vic ) .

(4)

Thus, the reduced-form transmission of parental income to child’s income studied by CHKS
is, in this framework, the sum of a component operating through the potential mediator and
the direct eﬀect:
✓ ⌘ ⇡ + µ.

(5)

Each of the coeﬃcients in (2) and (3) may vary across CZs, and all may depend in
important ways on local institutions and policies. For example, when sic is a human capital
measure, a CZ with a bad system of public education, in which only those who can aﬀord
private school tuition (or, perhaps, a house in one of the few excellent public school districts)
can obtain good schools for their children, would have a high ⇡. A very unequal CZ labor
market, with high wages for those with high human capital but few opportunities for those
with little, would yield a high . Finally, a labor market in which strong family networks are
needed to access good job opportunities would imply high µ. Thus, understanding which of
these accounts – even descriptively – for the between-CZ variation in ✓ would inform further
investigation of the determinants of intergenerational transmission.

3.2

Estimating the importance of test score transmission as a mediator
using across-CZ variation

A barrier to estimating equations (2) and (3) is that few data sets contain all of the necessary measures. Tax data provide pic and yic for enormous samples, but only one potential
mediator, whether the child enrolls in college by age 21. Using this as sic , CHKS estimate
⇡c for each CZ and find that it is highly correlated with ✓c (⇢ = 0.68). However, as I discuss
below, for plausible

the variation in ⇡c is too small to account for more than a small share

of the variation in ✓c .
The ELS provides richer measures of human capital, but for a sample that is far too small
to permit reliable estimation of ⇡c for each CZ. In lieu of this, I develop a methodology for

10

estimating the across-CZ bivariate regression of ✓c on ⇡c , even when CZ-level samples are
too small to permit estimation of ⇡c directly.8 The slope of this regression can be interpreted
as an (observational) estimate of . The R2 provides an initial estimate of the share of the
variance of ✓c that is attributable to the mediating role of human capital accumulation. In
subsection 3.3, I develop a more careful decomposition.
My approach is built from the “reverse” projection of ⇡c onto ✓c :

⇡c =
where

=

cov(✓c ,⇡c )/

2
✓

(6)

+ ✓c + ⌘ c ,

is the across-CZ linear projection coeﬃcient and ⌘c is orthogonal to

✓c by construction. If the terms of (6), including the residual variance

2

were known it

would be straightforward to obtain the forward regression of ✓c on ⇡c ,

R2 . Note that ✓c and therefore

2
✓

are observed directly, in CHKS’s computations from population data.
To estimate (6), I return to equation (2), making explicit the variation in the coeﬃcients
across CZs:

sic = ↵c + pic ⇡c + uic

(9)

Substituting (6) into (9), we obtain

sic = ↵c + pic ( + ✓c + ⌘c ) + uic
8

(10)

I model sic as a mediator of yic , and thus ⇡c as a mediator of ✓c . However, reverse causality from income
transmission, ✓c , to human capital transmission, ⇡c , is possible. For example, it may be easier to attract
high-ability college graduates into teaching in CZs with more equal labor markets, creating a causal path
from economic mobility to gaps in children’s outcomes.

11

Equation (10) is the basis of my analysis. It leads to four types of specifications. First, a
simple national regression of sic on pic restricts

= 0 and

2
⌘

= 0.

Second, I divide the nation into deciles of the distribution of ✓c and regress sic on pic
separately in each decile d. By regressing the coeﬃcients ˆd from these regressions on average
income transmission in each decile, ✓¯d , I can test whether

= 0.9

Third, returning to pooled data, I can add to the national regression an interaction of
pic with ✓c . This interaction coeﬃcient estimates

in one step:

sic = ↵c + pic + (pic ✓c )

(11)

+ eic .

The error term here is eic ⌘ pic ⌘c + uic ; because both (9) and (6) are linear projections,
it is orthogonal to pic and pic ✓c by construction. To ensure that

and

are identified

from within-CZ variation, I divide pic into its between- and within-CZ components, and
include main eﬀects and ✓c interactions for each. I also remove the grand mean of ✓c to
permit comparisons of
Defining p̃ic ⌘ pic

to the simpler specification, and include a main eﬀect for ✓c

p̄c , and ✓˜c ⌘ ✓c

¯ the regression is:
✓,

sic = ↵c + p̃ic + p̃ic ✓˜c + Xc ⌦ + eic ,
where Xc includes p̄c , p̄c ✓c

✓¯ .

✓¯ , and ✓c

(12)

✓¯ . This is equivalent to simply controlling for

Xc in (10). I explore OLS, (correlated) random eﬀects, and fixed eﬀects specifications for
↵c , in each case reporting standard errors that are clustered at the CZ level to handle the
dependence of eic .
Finally, my primary estimates are based on the full model (10), without restrictions.
It can be seen as a random coeﬃcients model, also known as a mixed model, with fixed
coeﬃcients

and

and random coeﬃcients ↵c and ⌘c . If we assume that (↵c , ⌘c ) and uic

are each normally distributed and i.i.d., it can be estimated by maximum likelihood.10 This
9
With more data, one could use smaller cells. In the limit, with the first-stage regression estimated in
each CZ separately, it estimates ⇡c , and the second-stage regression of ⇡
ˆc on ✓c is equation (6) and estimates
. I present this analysis in the appendix, but it is poorly behaved in the small ELS sample.
10
Gelman and Hill (2006) discuss the estimation of models like (10), which are referred to variously
as mixed, hierarchical, random coeﬃcient, or multi-level models. There is no fully satisfactory way to
handle sampling weights in these models. Accordingly, I estimate them without weights. In simpler models,

12

yields an estimate not just of

but also of

2
⌘,

so can be used to compute the forward regres-

sion (7). As in the fixed-coeﬃcient specification, I separate p̄c from pic

p̄c , to ensure that

only within-CZ variation identifies the coeﬃcients of interest.11 The identifying assumption
(beyond normality) is that ⌘c is orthogonal to ✓c . Recalling that ⌘c is the residual in (6),
this simply means that the mixed model identifies only the observational regression of ⇡c on
✓c (and vice versa), and does not solve the causal inference problem.
One way to validate this strategy is to use the child’s income as the skill measure – that
is, let sic ⌘ yic . This makes transmission to skill, ⇡c , identical to transmission to child’s
income, ✓c , thus ensuring that

= 1 and

2
⌘

= 0 in (6). I implement a version of this in

Appendix Table A2. Results are encouraging, though not perfect. The estimate of

2
⌘

is

nearly identically zero – a result that does not occur for any of the other outcomes I examine
below. The estimated

coeﬃcient, however, is attenuated by about one-third from what

was expected. I attribute this to the fact that this exercise mixes two diﬀerent data sets –
✓c is measured in tax data, while I measure yic and pic in the ELS. As discussed above, the
ELS measure of pic is of lower quality than the tax measure, while the ELS yic is measured
at a younger age.
A diﬀerent mixed model can be used to estimate the relationship between ✓c and the
return to skill in the local labor market, defined as the coeﬃcient of a regression of incomes
on human capital:
yic = ̃c + sic ˜c + ṽic .

(13)

The standard omitted variables formula can be used to relate this reduced-form coeﬃcient
to the transmission coeﬃcients from the path diagram in Figure 1:

(14)

estimates are very similar with and without weights, so this is not likely to dramatically aﬀect my results. In
economics, it is common to estimate models like (10) in two stages, as in footnote 9. This does not require a
normality assumption on (↵c , ⌘c ), but estimation of ⌘2 requires distinguishing what portion of the across-CZ
variation in ⇡
ˆc is due to sampling error. As noted above, this is poorly behaved in the ELS sample. The
mixed model approach can achieve better precision by pooling information across CZs.

The random coeﬃcient is specified to apply only to pic p̄c , so the random intercept is ↵

I do not restrict the correlation between ↵
˜ c and ⌘c . In most specifications, the estimated correlation is quite

close to 1, suggesting that ↵
is small.

Decomposing the across-CZ variation in income transmission

The mixed models yield separate estimates of the relationships between ✓c and ⇡c and
between ✓c and ˜ c . Also of interest is the decomposition of the across-CZ variation in ✓c
into its component parts. In this subsection I outline a strategy to decompose the separate
contributions of variation in ⇡c ,

c,

and µc .

My starting point is the “structural” equation (3), allowing for CZ-level heterogeneity in
the coeﬃcients:
yic = c + sic

+ pic µc + vic .

c

(16)

The gradient of this with respect to parent income in CZ c is:
dyic
dsic
|c =
|c
dpic
dpic

c

+ µc

(17)

Given the definitions of ✓c and ⇡c , this is simply the decomposition defined earlier:

✓c = ⇡c

c

+ µc .

(18)

The across-CZ gradient of (17) with respect to ✓c is:
d2 yic
d2 sic
=
dpic d✓c
dpic d✓c

c

+

dsic d c dµc
|c
+
dpic d✓c
d✓c

(19)

12
In principle, one could estimate the relationships of ✓c with c and µc via a version of this strategy, by
including a control for pic in (13), with its own fixed and random coeﬃcients. I have explored this model, but
it is quite poorly behaved. I do use a fixed-coeﬃcient version of this model in the decomposition discussed
in subsection 3.3.

14

or, using (18),
1=

d⇡c
d✓c

c

+ ⇡c

d c dµc
+
.
d✓c
d✓c

(20)

Each of the terms on the right side of (20) is interpretable as reflecting a distinct component
of income transmission. The first term represents diﬀerences between high- and low-✓c CZs
in human capital accumulation gaps between high- and low-income families, scaled by the
return to human capital. But for scaling by

c,

this term is identified by the

coeﬃcient

of the “reverse” regression (6) discussed above in subsection 3.2. It would be large if high-✓c
CZs oﬀer less equal school quality to children from diﬀerent family backgrounds.
The second term reflects covariance of the CZ-level return to skill with CZ-level income
transmission, scaled by ⇡c ⌘

dsic
dpic |c .

This term would be large if high-✓c CZs have higher

returns to skill, producing better outcomes for children from high-income families who tend
to obtain higher skill. The third term reflects diﬀerences in the transmission of parental
income to children’s incomes holding skills constant. This might be large if high-✓c CZs
have segmented labor markets or employment networks that allow high-income parents to
ensure good outcomes for their children regardless of the children’s skills.
To decompose the variation across cities, I use fixed values ¯ and ⇡
¯ to scale the first and
second terms:

d2 yic
d2 sic
d c dµc
=
+
c + ⇡c
dpic d✓c
dpic d✓c
d✓c
d✓c
2
d sic ¯
d c dµc
⇡
+⇡
¯
+
,
dpic d✓c
d✓c
d✓c

(21)
(22)

This leads to a three-step method for the decomposition. First, I estimate ¯ and ⇡
¯ via pooled
regressions of yic on sic and of sic on pic , respectively. Second, I estimate

d2 sic
dpic d✓c

=

d⇡c
d✓c

=

via a regression of sic on pic , ✓c , and their interaction as in (11), above. Third, I regress
yic on sic , pic , ✓c , and the two interactions sic ⇤ ✓c and pic ⇤ ✓c . The interaction coeﬃcients
estimate

d c
d✓c

and

dµc
d✓c ,

respectively. As earlier, I include in each step the CZ means of the

individual-level variables, as well as CZ random eﬀects.
Next, consider the left side of (22). In principle,

15

dyic
dpic |c

is identically equal to ✓c , and

its derivative with respect to ✓c is therefore 1. In practice, I rely on CHKS’s estimates of
✓c from tax data and measures of yic and pic from the ELS. In this blended data set, the
regression of yic on pic , ✓c , and pic ✓c has an interaction coeﬃcient well below one. This
reflects measurement diﬀerences between the ELS sample and the tax data. I take the
empirical interaction coeﬃcient as the target of my decomposition.
A final issue is that CHKS define yic as family income, including any spousal earnings
and non-labor income. There are thus two channels for each of the elements of the decomposition. The return to human capital in the second term, for example, includes both labor
market and spousal market returns. These point to diﬀerent structural factors of the CZ
as explanations. Moreover, spousal market components of transmission may be artifacts
of the fact that I measure children’s income at a single point in time, when children are
around 25: CZs where children from high-income families typically marry young will have
higher measured income transmission than do CZs where these children typically marry
later, but may not meaningfully diﬀer in the extent of available opportunity. Therefore,
I separate children’s incomes into their own earnings wic and the remaining component,
reflecting spousal earnings and non-labor income: yic = wic + (yic

wic ). I apply the above

decomposition only to the children’s earnings, and consider the reduced-form transmission
of parental income to children’s spousal and non-labor income as a separate mechanism.

Results

I present results in four parts. First, to lay the groundwork, I present national estimates of
the path diagram in Figure 1, using the ELS sample. Second, I use the variation in these
estimates across CZs to identify the relationship between income transmission ✓c and human
capital transmission ⇡c . Third, I use ELS and ACS data to examine variation in the reducedform return to skill ˜ c across CZs, again relating it to CZ-level income transmission. Finally,
I implement the decomposition described in subsection 3.3, attributing variation across CZs
in income transmission to marriage market factors, skill accumulation, returns to skill, and
direct transmission of parental income to children’s earnings.

4.1

National estimates

Table 3 presents estimates of the national relationships between parental income, children’s
human capital, and children’s incomes, using the ELS sample. All specifications are weighted
and include CZ fixed eﬀects.
Columns 1 and 2 show the reduced-form relationships between parental income and children’s 12th grade math scores and educational attainment, respectively. Each percentile of
parental income is associated with 0.35 percentiles of children’s achievement, and with 0.019
years of education.13 Column 3 presents an analysis of reduced-form income transmission.
Each percentile of parental income is associated with 0.16 percentiles of children’s adult
incomes.
Columns 4-6 show regressions of the child’s adult family income on the two human capital
measures, first separately and then together. Each math score percentile is associated with
0.24 percentiles in additional income, while each year of education is associated with 3.6
percentiles. Each coeﬃcient falls, as expected, when both measures are included together.
Finally, column 7 includes both parental income and child human capital controls. Here, the
parental income coeﬃcient represents µ in the path diagram. This is 0.07, less than half of
what it was without human capital controls in Column 3, but nevertheless highly significant.
The test score and education coeﬃcients, representing

, are only slightly reduced from

column 6. The role of human capital as a mediating factor can be computed by multiplying
these coeﬃcients by the corresponding ⇡ coeﬃcients in columns 1 and 2. This yields 0.35 ⇤
0.18 + 0.019 ⇤ 1.76 = 0.098, or roughly 60% of the total transmission in column 3.
The national analysis thus indicates that human capital is an important mediating factor
in intergenerational income transmission. As we will see, human capital plays a much smaller
role in explaining the across-CZ variation.
13

Bradbury et al. (2015) find that the parental income coeﬃcient is largely invariant to the age at which
children’s test scores are measured. I look across a larger range and find that it grows somewhat with age –
see Appendix Table A1. Bradbury et al. (2015) also compare results across four English-speaking countries.
This exercise is similar in spirit to my comparison across commuting zones.

4.2

Transmission from parental income to children’s human capital across
CZs

In this subsection, I examine variation across CZs in the transmission of parental income to
children’s human capital. I examine test scores first, then educational attainment.
4.2.1

12th grade math scores in the ELS

As a first eﬀort to explore across-CZ variation, I divide CZs into ten deciles based on ✓c .
For each decile, I estimate a separate regression of children’s test scores on parental income,
with CZ fixed eﬀects. Figure 2 plots the parental income coeﬃcients and confidence intervals
against the mean of ✓c in the decile. The slope of the best-fit line to this scatterplot, which
corresponds to

in (10), is 0.25, indicating that parental income is more strongly associated

with children’s test scores in high income transmission than in low income transmission CZs.
The implied diﬀerence between the 3rd and the 8th deciles – corresponding roughly to the
interquartile range of ✓c – is a 0.021 increase in the slope shown in column 1 of Table 3.
However, the figure also indicates substantial variation around the best-fit line, likely more
than could be explained by sampling error.
Table 4 presents parametric estimates of the interacted specifications (11) and (10). I
begin with a specification that does not allow for a ✓c interaction, as in Table 3, but show
both within- and between-CZ coeﬃcients.14
Columns 2-4 include interactions between parental income and CZ income transmission
✓c . Column 2 is an OLS specification without CZ-level variation in the intercept (but with
a ✓c main eﬀect); column 3 is a Generalized Least Squares model with CZ random eﬀects;
and column 4 includes CZ fixed eﬀects. The interaction coeﬃcient from each specification
estimates the coeﬃcient

in (11); it measures the extent to which CZs with strong trans-

mission from parent income to child income also exhibit strong transmission from parent
income to children’s test scores. This coeﬃcient is 0.32 in the OLS and FE specifications
14

The ELS is a multi-stage sample in which schools are sampled and students are sampled within schools.
When I decompose pic p̄c into the deviation from the school mean and the diﬀerence between school and CZ
means, the across-CZ and within-CZ, across-school coeﬃcients are indistinguishable, and the within-school
coeﬃcient is much smaller. This is exactly what one would expect based on measurement error in pic , but
could also derive from sorting into schools based on unobservables or school-based peer eﬀects.

18

and 0.37 in the RE specification; the diﬀerence reflects the use of sampling weights in the
OLS and FE specifications but not in the RE specification. Each is a fair amount larger
than the 0.25 estimate of

from Figure 2 and is comparable in magnitude to the within-CZ

parental income main eﬀect. While income-achievement transmission is (in column 3) 0.34
in the average CZ, it is 0.32 in a CZ at the 25th percentile of the ✓c distribution and 0.36 in
a CZ at the 75th percentile. As in Figure 2, these estimates are consistent with test scores
being a meaningful, though not overwhelming, mediator of the between-CZ diﬀerence in the
transmission of income across generations.
Column 5 presents the mixed model (10), allowing

2
⌘

> 0. This allows for variation

across CZs in income-achievement transmission that is not predicted by the CZ’s incomeincome transmission. I estimate

⌘

= 0.07. The hypothesis that

2
⌘

= 0 is decisively

rejected.15 The lower portion of the table shows various summaries of the joint distribution
of ✓c and ⇡c that is implied by the mixed model coeﬃcients. The standard deviation of
⇡c is 0.072, much larger than in previous columns. A CZ at the 25th percentile of the
⇡c distribution has income-test score transmission coeﬃcient 0.28, while one at the 75th
percentile has coeﬃcient 0.38. Most of this variation comes from the ⌘c component that is
orthogonal to ✓c , however: The correlation between ✓c and ⇡c is only 0.32.
The slope of ✓c with respect to ⇡c is a statistically significant 0.26 (S.E. 0.12): On
average, in CZs in which the test score advantage of children from rich families is 1 percentile
larger than average, the adult income advantage is about 0.26 percentiles larger than in the
average CZ. This is relatively small, but consistent with the national evidence. Table 3,
column 1 indicates that students whose test scores are one percentile above average tend to
have adult incomes 0.24 percentiles above average. Here, we find that CZs where the test
score gap between high-income and low-income students is one percentile greater than in
the average CZ have adult income gaps between those students that are, on average, 0.26
percentiles larger than in the average CZ. These are strikingly similar, and appear to point
to a meaningful role for student achievement as a mediator of income transmission.
15
The null hypothesis that ⌘ = 0 is on the boundary of the parameter space for the mixed model likelihood
function. The test is a likelihood ratio test based on the comparison of column 5 to the specification in
column 3, estimating the latter by maximum likelihood rather than by GLS. Note that the null hypothesis
that ⌘2 = 0 corresponds to a perfect correlation between ✓c and ⇡c , and to an R2 of 1 in the regression of
the former on the latter.

19

However, it is worth considering the magnitude of the across-CZ variation in test score
transmission. I estimate that the standard deviation of ⇡c is 0.072. Take 0.24 as the return
to a one percentile increase in test scores. Thus, each standard deviation of ⇡c drives an
increase of ✓c of 0.072 ⇤ 0.24 = 0.018. But the standard deviation of ✓c is 0.057, over
three times as large. In other words, there is much more variability in CZ income-income
transmission than can be operating through the test score channel: Only 11% of the acrossCZ variation in the former is explained by the latter. There are evidently other channels
that account for the bulk of the geographic variation in income transmission; test scores,
and the knowledge and skills that they represent, are a mechanism, but not the dominant
one.
4.2.2

Test scores across grades and subjects

By estimating the models in Table 4 for test scores measured at diﬀerent ages, I can explore
whether the relative advantage of high-income children in high-transmission CZs appears
to grow with age, as might be expected if schools play a role in income transmission. This
analysis is likely sensitive to scaling decisions (Bond and Lang, 2013, forthcoming). I scale
scores at each age in national percentiles, but a one percentile advantage in kindergarten
may not mean the same thing as a one percentile advantage in 12th grade. Setting this issue
aside, Table 5 presents mixed model estimates for each of the available test scores from the
ECLS, ELS, and HSLS. The

coeﬃcients in column 2 are similar in magnitude across most

of the specifications, though imprecisely estimated. The random component of the parental
income coeﬃcient (

⌘,

in column 3) is meaningful in each row, and column 6 indicates that

the null hypothesis that

⌘

= 0 is rejected in all but one case. The slope of ✓c with respect

to ⇡c (column 4) is modest and generally larger for reading than for math. It appears to
grow somewhat with age, though this is not entirely consistent. Correlations between ✓c and
⇡c (column 5) are quite low across grades and subjects, but again larger in later grades.
The pattern of results has several implications. First, there is some indication that the
relative importance of parental income to student test scores in high-income-transmission
CZs grows between kindergarten and high school, consistent with the hypothesis that differential access to school quality (rather than, say, parenting practices) is a mechanism
20

contributing to diﬀerential income transmission. Second, there is substantial heterogeneity across CZs in the transmission of parental income to children’s test scores that is not
associated with CZ-level income transmission, indicating that the institutions or other CZ
characteristics that contribute to test score transmission diﬀer from those determining income transmission. Put somewhat diﬀerently, there is only a modest correlation across CZs
between income-income and income-test score transmission, even in later grades, so diﬀerent influences must be at work. Finally, results are quite similar for the HSLS as for the
ELS, though the latter is much closer to the cohorts for which ✓c is computed, suggesting
that cohort diﬀerences are unable to explain the weak relationship of income-income and
income-test score transmission in the HSLS and ECLS.
4.2.3

Educational attainment

I have thus far used test scores as a summary of children’s human capital. An alternative
is to focus on educational attainment. I consider two summaries of attainment as of the
last ELS survey, around age 26: an indicator for a four-year degree and the number of years
of education. As discussed above, the ELS counts a surprisingly large share of students as
having attended some college, and results for this outcome (presented in the appendix) are
highly discrepant, and appear to be driven by over-measurement of college attendance in
the ELS. The other two attainment summaries are closer to expectations (Table 2).
Columns 1 and 3 of Table 6 present estimates of the interacted specification (11), with CZ
random eﬀects, for the two measures. (I report only the coeﬃcients pertaining to within-CZ
variation in parental income, though CZ means and an income transmission main eﬀect are
included as before.) Not surprisingly, parental income is strongly related to both measures
of children’s attainment. The interaction coeﬃcient

is large and statistically significant

for each outcome.
Columns 2 and 4 present the mixed model specifications. Likelihood ratio tests do not
reject the restrictions that the parental income random coeﬃcients are zero (i.e.,

⌘

=

0). Coeﬃcients of regressions of income transmission on income-attainment transmission
yield modest coeﬃcients: CZs where students from high-income families are 1 percentage
point more likely to graduate from college (relative to students from low-income families)
21

have adult income gaps between children from high- and low-income families that are 0.32
percentiles larger, and CZs where the high-income children earn one more year of education
have adult income gaps that are 12 percentiles larger. Neither of these is significantly
diﬀerent from zero.
The correlation between income transmission and attainment transmission is stronger
than for test scores, around 0.5. However, this is still quite far from 1; three-quarters of
the variance in income transmission across CZs is unexplained by diﬀerences in transmission
from parental income to children’s higher education attainment. As in the earlier analysis
of test scores, the evidence points to a role for educational attainment as a mechanism
driving variation in intergenerational income transmission, but does not indicate that it is
an overwhelming factor.
The R2 statistics in the lower portion of Table 6 provide one way to measure the importance of the attainment channel. Variation across CZs in the transmission of parental
income to educational attainment in years explains about one-quarter of the variability in
CZ-level income transmission. As with test scores, another way to understand this is to use
an estimate of the return to education to measure the importance of educational attainment
as a mediator of income transmission. I begin with CHKS’s measure of transmission from
parental income to college enrollment. They find that the standard deviation of ⇡c , across
CZs, is 0.11 percentage point of college enrollment per percentile of family income, very
similar to my estimate in column 2 of Table 6. In a regression of family income percentiles
on an indicator for some college in the ACS sample, with CZ fixed eﬀects, I find that those
with some college or more have family incomes about 19.2 percentiles higher than those
without college, on average. This implies that a one standard deviation increase in ⇡c would
drive only a 19.2⇤0.11 = 0.02 increase in ✓c , or less than one-third of a standard deviation of
that variable. I obtain even smaller magnitudes when I use my estimates of transmission of
parental income to other attainment measures. For example, column 4 of Table 6 indicates
that a one standard deviation of ⇡c is 0.0025 years of education per percentile of parental
income. Column 5 of Table 3 indicates that each year of education is associated with 3.6
additional percentiles of children’s income.16 Thus, a one-standard deviation increase in ⇡c
16

I obtain slightly larger estimates when I use the ACS sample – 4.1 using the full sample, or 5.9 when

22

drives an increase of ✓c of 0.0025 ⇤ 3.6 = 0.01, or about one-sixth of a standard deviation.
Although the transmission of parental income to children’s income is correlated across CZs
with transmission of parental income to children’s educational attainment, the latter again
appears not to be a primary mechanism for the former.
4.2.4

Robustness and additional results

The results above indicate that CZs with stronger-than-average transmission of parental income to children’s income tend also to have stronger-than-average transmission of parental
income to children’s test scores and educational attainment, but the relationships are not
large enough to account for a large share of the variation in intergenerational income transmission. This basic conclusion is robust to a variety of diﬀerent specification and measurement choices, explored in the appendix.
First, Appendix Table A5 explores the sensitivity of these results to the choice of income
transmission measure. Results are robust to using CHKS’s measure computed for the 198385 birth cohorts, which more closely corresponds to the ELS sample, or to using the more
plausibly causal measure from Chetty and Hendren (forthcoming).
Second, I show that the results are not driven by associations between parental income
and children’s race. CHKS document that ✓c is quite strongly correlated with the fraction
black in the CZ, though they also find that an alternative measure computed solely from
zip codes with very few black residents is quite similar. Appendix Table A6 augments the
main mixed model specifications with controls for the child’s own race and gender, as well
as interactions of race and gender with ✓c . This has little eﬀect.
Third, I explore alternative scalings of parental income and children’s test scores, in Appendix Table A7. The basic result of a weak relationship between CZ-level income transmission and CZ-level transmission from parental income to children’s achievement is unchanged
when I measure children’s test scores as z-scores or as predicted adult earnings (Bond and
Lang, forthcoming), or when I measure parental income in logs or as predicted children’s
test scores.
very high and very low levels of attainment are trimmed. These would not change the qualitative conclusion
I draw here.

23

Overall, the basic results on achievement, attainment, and income transmission appear
quite robust. They are suggestive that learning in school is not a key channel determining
the across-CZ variation in income transmission, but that access to higher education may be
more important.
One possibility not yet considered is that math and reading test scores do not fully
capture the impacts of better childhood environments. A growing literature in recent years
has documented the importance of non-cognitive skills as a component of human capital.
Both the ECLS and the ELS contain batteries of questions aimed at identifying children’s
non-cognitive skills, and I use these to assess whether high-income-transmission CZs tend to
be CZs with large gaps in non-cognitive skills between children from high- and low-income
families (Appendix Table A8). Results are mixed. The

coeﬃcient on the parental income

- CZ income transmission interaction is generally small and not statistically significant, and
frequently has the wrong sign. For about half of the available measures, there is statistically
significant variation across CZs in the return to parental income (i.e.,

⌘

6= 0). Overall,

there is little indication that non-cognitive skills are important mediators of income-toincome transmission. One set of results, however, tells a somewhat diﬀerent story. In the
ECLS, non-cognitive skill measures are constructed both from children’s survey responses
and from teacher surveys. The measures based on teacher surveys do tend to yield strong
associations with income transmission. It is not clear how to account for the discrepancy
between teacher surveys and student self-reports – even when the concepts overlap (e.g., for
externalizing problem behaviors), results are quite diﬀerent. This may indicate that hightransmission CZs tend to be CZs in which teachers are more biased in their assessments of
low-income children, but this is quite speculative.

4.3

Returns to human capital across CZs

The above results have concerned the role of skills – achievement, attainment, and noncognitive skills – as mediators of the intergenerational transmission of income. In terms of
Figure 1, the results suggest that ⇡c is not a primary mechanism influencing variation in
reduced-form transmission ✓c . This in turn implies that much of the variation in income
transmission must be due to diﬀerences in the returns to human capital (i.e., in
24

c)

or to

direct eﬀects of parental income on children’s income not operating through human capital
(i.e., to µc ).
As an initial exploration of this, I examine variation in the return to skill across CZs. As
before, I estimate mixed models, in this case allowing the return to human capital to vary
both with the CHKS income transmission measure and independently across CZs. These
models do not isolate the relationship between income transmission and

c

from Figure 1,

as to do that I would need to examine the return to skill controlling for parental income.
I simply examine the reduced-form return to skill, ˜ c =

c

strongly associated with ✓c , that could indicate either that

across-CZ variation in ✓c or that µc is.
Table 7, Panel A presents results for a sample of 28-32 year olds surveyed in 20102012 by the American Community Survey (ACS), and assigned to their current CZs.17
Column 1 shows that each year of education, relative to the CZ mean, is associated with 5.3
percentiles of adult earnings. Columns 2-4 present models that include interactions between
the individual’s education and CZ-level income transmission. The interaction coeﬃcient is
positive and highly significant, indicating that the (reduced-form) return to education is
larger in high-income-transmission CZs. Column 5 presents the mixed model, allowing for
unexplained heterogeneity across CZs in the return to education. This heterogeneity term is
substantial. The correlation between the CZ-level return to education and CZ-level income
transmission is about 0.5, comparable to the attainment transmission results earlier and
much larger than that for achievement transmission. The overall variability in returns to
education across CZs (i.e., in ˜ c ) is substantial, with a standard deviation of 0.7 (compared
to the mean of 5.3),. Only about 30% of this attributable to ✓c .
The lower panel of Table 7 presents a parallel analysis of returns to skill in the ELS
data. Here, I combine my two human capital measures, constructing a skill index as the
fitted value from a regression of children’s earnings on their 12th grade math scores and
indicators for each possible attainment, with CZ fixed eﬀects. This skill index is strongly
17
I censor years of education at 9 and 17. Values outside this range are unusual. The earnings-education
relationship is approximately linear within this range, but not outside it. Table 7 shows results for the
individual earnings percentile as the dependent variable, but results are similar when the family income
percentile is used instead.

25

related to earnings, as expected.18 It is much more strongly related in high-transmission
CZs, with interaction coeﬃcients that are notably larger than the main eﬀects. Column
5 indicates, however, that there is a great deal of variation in the returns to skill that is
orthogonal to income transmission, and the correlation between the two is only 0.3.

5

Decomposing the across-CZ variation in income transmission

The results thus far indicate that intergenerational income transmission is positively correlated across CZs with transmission from parental income to children’s test scores and
educational attainment, and with the reduced-form labor market returns to human capital.
Some preliminary calculations indicate that neither the achievement nor the attainment relationship is large enough, on its own, to be a primary channel in overall income transmission,
but I have not yet considered them together or quantified the contribution of the returnto-skill eﬀects. Moreover, the returns to skill estimates are reduced-form, and combine true
returns to skill with any eﬀect of parental income on children’s income not operating through
education (i.e., with µc ). In this section, I explore decompositions of the across-CZ variation
in income transmission that address these shortcomings.
As a preliminary, I explore income-income transmission, ✓c , in the ELS data. Measurement diﬀerences between the ELS and the tax data used by CHKS mean that the ✓c s
implied by the ELS data diﬀer somewhat from the tax-data-based ✓c s reported by CHKS
– though they are nearly perfectly correlated. I also show that marriage patterns and labor force participation are quantitatively important channels for intergenerational income
transmission. This motivates me to extend the three-component path diagram from Figure
1 by considering transmission into children’s own earnings and into the other components
of family income (spousal earnings and non-labor income) separately. I decompose the
transmission of parental income to children’s earnings into the three components from the
18

In constructing the skill index, I measure children’s earnings as a percentile of the adult income distribution, for use in my decomposition below. Thus, a child with median earnings ($22,000 in the ELS
sample) is assigned a percentile of 38, as $22,000 is the 38th percentile of the family income distribution.
The dependent variable in Table 7 is the percentile of the child earnings distribution, in which the same
child would be assigned a percentile of 50. This explains why the coeﬃcient is larger than one in column 1.

school; (b) returns to skills; and (c) direct eﬀects of parental income on children’s earnings
not operating through observed human capital. I then separately estimate the contribution
from transmission of parental income into spousal earnings and non-labor income. Figure 3
illustrates the expanded diagram.

Income transmission in the ELS sample

Table 8 presents mixed models, akin to those used earlier to examine transmission from
parental income to children’s achievement, where here the dependent variables are diﬀerent
components of ELS children’s incomes.
In column 1, the dependent variable is the child’s total family income, as a percentile
of the national distribution.19 This is very nearly the same measure used by CHKS to
construct their income transmission measures. Thus, we expect the ⇡c in this specification,
the CZ-level transmission of parental income to children’s income in the ELS sample, to
be identical to CHKS’s ✓c , but for diﬀerences in measurement between the ELS and the
tax data. Indeed, I estimate a correlation of 0.99, and

2
⌘

⇡ 0. However, the scales are

somewhat diﬀerent: Where one would expect an interaction coeﬃcient

= 1, I instead

estimate ˆ = 0.64 (SE 0.16). The implied regression of ✓c on ⇡c , has coeﬃcient 1.52, though
here the expected 1 is within the confidence interval. These results might reflect the lower
quality of the ELS parental income measure, relative to the tax data,20 or the fact that the
ELS child income is measured at age 25, where in the tax data it is measured around age
30.21
Columns 2-4 replace the dependent variable with indicators (scored as 0 or 100) for
positive own earnings, for being married, and for having positive spousal earnings. In each
case, the interaction coeﬃcient between parental income and CZ-level income transmission
is positive and significant: In high-transmission CZs, children from high-income families are
19

Appendix Table A2 presents fixed-coeﬃcient versions of this specification.
I have explored specifications that instrument for parental income with parental education. Although
the exclusion restriction is dubious, this does raise the coeﬃcient to around 1, consistent with bias from
measurement error in parental income.
21
CHKS find that average income transmission is lower when children’s income is measured at younger
ages, but do not present evidence regarding cross-CZ variation.
20

27

relatively more likely than children from low-income families to work, to be married, and to
have a working spouse. In each case, the across-CZ correlation between income transmission
and transmission of parental income to the outcome is around 0.5. Evidently, an important
part of the variation in income transmission reflects labor force participation rather than
solely diﬀerences in earnings conditional on participation; another important part relates to
marital patterns.
Further light is shed by the gender breakdown in Panel B. CZ-level income transmission
is almost perfectly correlated with the CZ-level association between parental income and
daughters’ labor force participation, though there is little variation across CZs in the latter.
In Column 5, I use the child’s earnings as the dependent variable. Earnings are scaled
here as a percentile of the family income distribution, to permit a direct comparison to
column 1 (see footnote 18). The pic -✓c interaction coeﬃcient is here only 0.38 (S.E. 0.14),
reduced by nearly half from column 1. Evidently, a large part of the variation in measured
income transmission, using CHKS’s definitions, derives from components other than the
child’s own earnings – either spousal earnings, or non-labor income. This is particularly true
for men. Column 6 adds non-labor income (for both the child and the spouse, if present)
into the income measure. Results are similar to those in column 5. The key interaction
coeﬃcient remains much lower than in column 1, especially for sons.
Spousal earnings, the only component of family income included in column 1 but not
column 6, are clearly an important factor. This could reflect variation across CZs in the
relative likelihood that children from high- and low-income families have working spouses,
as seen in column 4, but it could also reflect diﬀerences in spousal earnings distributions
conditional on work, as would occur if CZs vary in the degree of assortative mating. To
assess the role of the latter, I shut oﬀ any assortative matching by assigning all working
spouses the same earnings. I compute the average earnings across the entire sample for
working spouses, by gender – $27,000 for women and $41,000 for men – and use these for
every working spouse in the sample, assigning 0 for those who are unmarried or have nonworking spouses. I then construct a family income as the sum of the child’s actual earnings,
any non-labor income, and imputed spousal earnings. As before, this sum is converted to a
percentile of the actual child family income distribution. Insofar as an important part of the
28

variation in income transmission reflects diﬀerences in assortative mating, we would expect
the

coeﬃcient in column 7 to more closely resemble that in column 6 than that in column

1. This is not what I find. ˆ here is even larger than in column 1. Evidently, diﬀerences in
assortative mating are not contributing meaningfully to the across-CZ variation in family
income transmission.
I interpret the results in Table 8 as pointing to the importance of marriage as a mechanism
driving between-CZ variation in measured income transmission. Nearly one-third of the
across-CZ variation in income transmission is explained by diﬀerences in within-CZ gradients
of marriage (at the time of the age-26 ELS follow-up survey) with respect to parent income.
This may represent a spurious component of the variation in ✓c . It is not clear whether a
two-earner couple should be seen as as successful as a single person with the same family
income. Moreover, the median age of marriage for the ELS cohorts is around 26 (U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 2004), so it is quite possible that many people who are not married
at age 26 or even at 30 will be later, and will eventually be able to pool their earnings with
their spouses to achieve much higher family incomes than I see in the age-26 survey.
Whether transmission operating through marriage is spurious or not, the interpretation
of income-marriage transmission is quite diﬀerent than that of income-earnings transmission,
even though both may be statistically mediated by the child’s human capital. Going forward,
I separate children’s family incomes into the child’s own earnings and a second component
combining spousal earnings and non-labor income, and I focus on the mediating role of
human capital for the former.

5.2

Decomposition of income transmission

Table 9 presents my analysis of the decomposition of across-CZ variation in income transmission into the four components indicated in Figure 3: Skill accumulation, as moderated by
the average own-earnings return to skill; returns to skill, moderated by the average parental
income gradient in skill accumulation; “direct” transmission of parental income to children’s
earnings conditional on human capital; and spousal and non-labor income.
Column 1 presents the baseline income transmission analysis, using the family income
percentile as the dependent variable. This specification is the same as in column 1 of Table 8,
29

but omits the random coeﬃcient on parental income. Of interest is the interaction between
pic

p̄c and ✓c . This coeﬃcient would be identically 1 if I used the same sample and income

measures as were used by CHKS in their calculation of ✓c . My estimate is just over two-thirds
of that.
Next, I decompose children’s family incomes into the child’s earnings and the remainder,
reflecting spousal earnings and non-labor income. I scale children’s earnings as a percentile
of the family income distribution, as in Table 8, then scale the remaining component as the
increment to the family’s income percentile that is obtained by adding spousal earnings and
non-labor income. Column 2 presents the analysis of children’s earnings, using the same
specification as in column 1. The interaction coeﬃcient falls by nearly half, to 0.37 – as
in Table 8, only a bit over half of the across-CZ variation in parental income-child income
transmission is attributable to variation in parental income-child earnings transmission.
Columns 3-5 decompose the transmission into child earnings into three components, reflecting skill accumulation, returns to skills, and direct transmission, using the methods
introduced in subsection 3.3. In Column 3, I show the component reflecting skill accumulation. I use the same skill index used in Table 7, combining 12th grade math scores and
years of completed education, and scaled as the predicted child earnings percentile. By
construction, the return to this index in child earnings, ¯ , is almost identically 1.22 I repeat
the random eﬀects regression from column 2, replacing the child’s actual earnings percentile
with the skill index. Not surprisingly given the earlier results, the interaction term, which
represents the first term of the decomposition (22), is small, and is not statistically significant. The point estimate of 0.08 implies that relative skill accumulation of children from
high- and low-income families, and the earnings gap that it generates, accounts for only 11%
(= 0.08/0.69) of the diﬀerences in ELS income transmission between cities with low and high
values of the CHKS transmission measure.
Columns 4 and 5 explore the role of returns to skill and direct transmission, respectively. These come from a single regression of the child’s actual earnings on her skill index
and parental income, each interacted with CZ income transmission. The skill-✓c interaction

the second term of the decomposition (22) can then be obtained

by multiplying it by the coeﬃcient of parental income in a pooled regression for children’s
skill, ⇡
¯ = 0.09. Thus, the second term, in column 4, is 0.84 ⇤ 0.09 = 0.07, indicating that
diﬀerences in returns to skill account for another 11% of the variation in income transmission.23 The third component of the decomposition (22), in column 5, is estimated by
the parental income-✓c interaction, 0.23. This indicates that diﬀerences in the relationship
between parental income and child earnings, controlling for both the child’s human capital
and the CZ-level return to that human capital, account for one-third of the total variation
in income transmission across CZs.
Finally, column 6 presents results for the portion of family income deriving from spousal
earnings and non-labor income. This is significantly more strongly related to parental income
in CZs that CHKS measure as high-transmission than in those measured as low-transmission,
and this accounts for 41% of the total variation in CZ-level income transmission. As Table
8 indicates, this largely reflects diﬀerences in the likelihood of being married at age 26, not
diﬀerences in assortative matching.
The lower panel of Table 9 reports the decomposition separately for boys and girls.
CHKS’s income transmission measure better captures parent-daughter family income relationships than it does parent-son relationships. Transmission to the child’s own earnings is
similar for both, so represents a larger share of the total for sons. For them, returns to skills
are twice as important as skill accumulation. For daughters, the return to skill is actually
negatively associated with ✓c , and skill accumulation is only trivially positively associated.
All of the variation in transmission to earnings is operating through the direct component,
controlling for human capital. This in part reflects variation in the relationship between
parental income and daughters’ labor force participation, as documented in Table 8. The
contribution of spousal earnings to between-✓c diﬀerences in family income transmission is
about twice as large for girls as for boys. Table 8 indicates that this is largely due to a
stronger role of marital status for girls, not to greater assortative mating.
23
This component also captures diﬀerences in the accumulation of unobserved skills not measured by math
scores or educational attainment: These are an omitted variable that is correlated with observed skill, so if
some CZs have stronger gradients of unobserved skill with respect to parent income, they would appear to
have higher returns to observed skill.

31

Overall, these results make clear that diﬀerences in skill accumulation – achievement
and attainment – account for only a small share of the variation across CZs in income
transmission. Marriage patterns are the largest single channel explaining family income
transmission. For sons, returns to skills also play a meaningful role, while for daughters
the transmission of parental income to children’s earnings not mediated by human capital
is more important.

Conclusion

Chetty et al.’s (2014a) pathbreaking work showed that there is dramatic variation in intergenerational income mobility across geographic areas within the United States. This
raises the intriguing possibility that we can identify policies that account for this variation
and, by exporting these policies from high- to low-mobility areas, move closer to equality of
opportunity.
CHKS presented suggestive correlations indicating that school quality might be an important contributing factor. This paper has investigated this suggestion by asking whether
high- and low-income children’s academic outcomes are more equal in areas where their adult
economic outcomes are more equal. I find that there is statistically significant variation
across commuting zones in the gradients of educational attainment, academic achievement,
and non-cognitive skills with respect to parental income. This variation is positively correlated with variation in income transmission across CZs, but the correlations are modest.
Moreover, while substantial, the variation in human capital transmission is not large enough
in magnitude to be a primary mechanism by which income is transmitted across generations.
I find that only about one-ninth of the across-CZ variation in intergenerational income
mobility is attributable to diﬀerences in children’s earnings deriving from diﬀerences in the
accumulation of observed skills. A similar share is attributable to diﬀerences in the labor
market returns to children’s skills. About one-third is attributable to diﬀerences in the
labor market return to parental income holding skills (and the returns to skills) constant.
The remaining, largest portion derives from diﬀerences in spousal and non-labor income,
primarily reflecting diﬀerences in the likelihood of having a working spouse.
32

Together, these facts indicate that the education system makes only a modest contribution to variation in intergenerational income transmission. The evidence points to other
factors as potentially more important, including cultural tendencies toward early marriage
and local labor market factors that influence the labor force participation rate and the ability of children from high-income families to match into high-earnings jobs conditional on
their education and skills.
This is not to say that school quality is not important for other reasons, of course, or
even that it does not contribute to overall mobility in a way that is roughly constant across
CZs. Nevertheless, further investigation into determinants of local intergenerational mobility
should expand from a near-exclusive focus on education to other potential mechanisms.
One area for further attention is diﬀerences in the likelihood of marriage, either because
CZs vary in the likelihood that romantic partners will be formally married or because of
variation in partnership rates. In terms of earnings outcomes, other areas of interest include
local income inequality and labor market institutions that influence it (e.g., unions), and
factors influencing the strength of local labor market networks and the spatial and social
stratification of the local market.

Notes: Dependent variable in each column is the 12th grade math score, in national percentile
units (0-100). Parental income is also measured in percentiles (0-100). CZ income transmission
is the relative mobility measure for the 1980-82 birth cohorts from Chetty et al. (2014),
demeaned across CZs. Specifications labeled “RE” and “FE” include CZ random effects and
fixed effects, respectively. RE specification in column 3 is estimated via GLS; mixed model in
column 5 is estimated by maximum likelihood. Specifications in columns 1, 2, and 4 are
weighted using ELS sampling weights; columns 3 and 5 are unweighted. Standard errors are
clustered at the CZ level. p-value in column 5 is for a likelihood ratio test of the mixed model
against a random effects model with fixed coefficients (as in column 3, though estimated by
maximum likelihood rather than GLS). Number of observations (rounded to the nearest 10) =
13,650.

Notes: Each row presents statistics from a single mixed model pertaining to a different test score
(for a given sample, grade, and subject), each scaled as national percentile units (0-100). Parent
incomes in columns 1-3 are percentiles, deviated from the CZ mean. Specifications are as in
Table 4, column 5. See notes to Table 4 for details. Number of observations (rounded to the
nearest 10) ranges between 9,140 and 20,430.

Notes: Specifications in columns 1 and 3 are as in Table 4, column 3; those in columns 2 and 4
are as in Table 4, column 5. All columns include controls for CZ mean parental income, CZ
income transmission, and their interaction. See notes to Table 4 for details. Dependent variable
in columns 1-2 is scaled as 0 for failures and 100 for successes; in columns 3-4, dependent
variable is years of education multiplied by 100. Standard errors are clustered at the CZ level.
Number of observations (rounded to the nearest 10) = 13,250.

Notes: All specifications are as in Table 4, column 5. All columns include main effects for CZ mean
parental income and CZ income transmission and their interaction. See notes to Table 4 for details. In
columns 1 and 5-7, dependent variable is a measure of child income, scaled as a percentile (0-100) of the
child total family income distribution. In columns 2-4, dependent variable is an indicator, multiplied by
100. Number of observations (rounded to the nearest 10) ranges from 11,510 to 16,200 in Panel A.

Notes: Each specification has controls for CZ mean parental income, the individual deviation
from that mean, income transmission, and an interaction between CZ mean income and CZ
income transmission. Columns 4 and 5 report a single specification, which also includes the CZ
mean of the skill index (see notes to Table 7 for details) and its interaction with income
transmission. See text for explanation of scale factors and scaling of dependent variables.

Appendices
A

Additional results

This appendix discusses additional specifications and results not included in the main tables.

A.1

Descriptive statistics

I begin with descriptive statistics for the samples used.
Appendix Table A1 presents the national relationship between parental income and child
achievement, as in Table 3, column 1, for each of the achievement measures available in the
ECLS, HSLS, and ELS, as well as for several summaries of educational attainment from
the ELS. Parental income is less strongly related to children’s test scores in the HSLS and
ELS than in the ECLS, but it is not clear whether this reflects diﬀerences across grades
or diﬀerences among the surveys. There is no indication of an age gradient within any
individual survey.
Appendix Figure A1 presents scatterplots of mean child outcomes for each of the 13
parental income categories reported in the ELS. Parental income is scaled as a percentile,
as in the main analysis, as are children’s test scores, earnings, and family incomes. One of
the parental income categories, zero income, is quite rare – only 0.2% of all observations –
so is indicated by hollow markers. For all four of the outcomes presented, the relationship
with parental income is reasonably linear in these percentile plots, supporting the scaling
choices adopted above. Appendix Table A7, discussed below, shows that my main results
are robust to the use of several alternative scales.

A.2

Additional analyses of primary specifications

Next, I present analyses using the same interacted specifications as in the main analysis.
Appendix Figure A3 repeats the exercise from Figure 2 for other relationships. As in
Figure 2, CZs are divided into deciles by ✓c , and regressions are estimated separately for
each decile. In panel A, the within-decile regression is of children’s income on parental
income. This is a semi-parametric version of the model from Table 8, column 1. As there,

i

the coeﬃcient across ✓ is quite high, and points are fairly tightly clustered around the best-fit
line. Panel B repeats Figure 2, using the child’s test score as the dependent variable. While
there is a positive slope here, it is much attenuated, and there is a great deal more variability
around the best-fit line. Panels C and D present coeﬃcients from child income regressions
that control for test scores and parental income simultaneously. The test score coeﬃcients,
in Panel C, estimate

c,

while the parental income coeﬃcients, in Panel D, estimate µc . We

see a steep slope in Panel C. In Panel D, the µc estimates are also more strongly correlated
with ✓c than are the ⇡c coeﬃcients in panel B. This supports the conclusion in the paper
that µc is a more important channel for explaining ✓c than is ⇡c .
Appendix Table A2 presents interacted and mixed models for the relationship between
parental income and children’s income in the ELS. The mixed model in column 5 repeats
the results from Table 8, column 1; other columns here present simpler models without
random coeﬃcients. Across all the columns, the interaction coeﬃcients are around 0.65
or higher, and in the random eﬀects specifications the expected coeﬃcient of 1 is outside
of the confidence interval. CZs that CHKS estimate have higher parent-to-child income
transmission also have higher transmission in the ELS, but not by quite as much. In the
mixed model in column 5, the across-CZ standard deviation of income transmission is smaller
than in CHKS’s estimates, 0.037 vs. 0.057, but they are nearly perfectly correlated. This
high correlation is not surprising, of course, since ✓c is defined as the return to parental
income in children’s income, and the ⇡c obtained from the ELS sample diﬀers from this only
because the income measures and cohorts diﬀer slightly. Thus, the high correlation serves
to validate the use of the ELS sample for this exercise.
However, the small coeﬃcient , 0.64 in Column 5 and similar in earlier columns, and the
correspondingly low estimated
perfectly comparable,

✓ ELS ,

remains a concern. If the ELS and tax measures were

should equal one. The attenuated coeﬃcient must reflect diﬀerences

in the income concepts between the ELS and the tax data, either for parents or for children.
A likely suspect is that the ELS children’s income is measured at a younger age than in the
tax data, mid-20s vs. the early 30s. This may attenuate income transmission, as 25-year-olds
are often not yet settled in their careers or families. Another potential explanation is that
the ELS parental income measure is from only a single year and is reported in bins, so likely
ii

measures parents’ permanent income with error. However, when parents were asked their
incomes several times in diﬀerent ECLS waves, binned measures like those reported by the
ELS are correlated around 0.85 across waves, and around 0.95 with a measure constructed
from the three-wave average. Thus, pure measurement error relative to permanent income
does not fully account for the attenuation of . Nevertheless, it may somewhat attenuate
estimates of ✓ELS ; in this case, the ELS is also likely to yield attenuated estimates of ⇡c .
Any variation in the reliability of pic across CZs would tend to lead me to overstate the
association between ✓c and ⇡c .
In Table 6, I showed that high-✓c CZs have stronger relationships, on average, between
parental income and children’s college graduation and years of education. But I omitted
from that table results for any college, the one mediator that CHKS are able to measure,
due to the evident diﬀerences between the ELS version of this variable (with a sample mean
of 0.84) and versions that can be constructed from CHKS’s tax data (mean = 0.60) or the
ACS sample (mean = 0.53). It appears that some students with weak attachment to higher
education – perhaps they enrolled briefly and dropped out, or signed up for a program at
a non-accredited institution – are reporting some postsecondary enrollment in the ELS but
are not captured in other surveys. Consistent with this, 70% of those with some college in
the ACS have at least an associates degree, but in the ELS this share is around half.
Appendix Table A3 explores transmission to any college in the ELS, using successively
more restrictive definitions of college enrollment, in the basic random eﬀects and mixed
models. In columns 1-2, I use the ELS measure without adjustment. Column 2 indicates
that the transmission of parental income to child college-going is negatively correlated with
CZ income transmission. This is in stark contrast to CHKS’s results for income-enrollment
transmission using their measure of whether tuition was paid for a student between ages
18 and 21 at an institution that made an information report to the IRS, which indicated a
correlation of 0.68 with ✓c .
Remaining columns tighten the definition of college enrollment. In columns 3-4, I count
students who attended postsecondary education but did not get any certificate, degree, or
other sort of credential as non-attendees; in columns 5-6 I include these students but exclude
those who received only certificates; and in columns 7-8 I turn instead to an indicator for
iii

having an associates degree or more. Each of these specifications yields a positive (albeit
weak in some cases) correlation between ✓c and ⇡c , suggesting that the anomalous results
in columns 1-2 are driven by the students with the least meaningful connections to college.
In column 8, the correlation approaches that obtained by CKHS.

A.3

Alternative transmission measures

All of the results in the main paper and in Appendix A.1 use CHKS’s preferred relative
mobility measure. Here, I explore three alternative measures.
Appendix Table A4 continues the exploration of transmission from parental income to
children’s educational attainment. Here, I repeat the mixed model specifications for each
of the attainment measures from Table 6 and Appendix Table A3, but in place of CHKS’s
preferred measure of income transmission, I use their analogous measure of the transmission
from parental income to children’s college enrollment in the CZ. That is, in this table ✓c
is the slope of an indicator for ever enrolling in college between 18 and 21 on the parents’
income percentile. Not surprisingly given the discussion above, this is only weakly correlated
with ⇡c in column 1, where the dependent variable is an indicator for any college by the
age-26 ELS survey. This is a further indication that the ELS measure may be over-broad.
Correlations and slopes of ✓c with respect to ⇡c are much higher in the subsequent columns.
Indeed, transmission from parent income to child’s educational attainment in years, or to
attainment of a two-year degree, is correlated 0.8 with CHKS’s ✓c measure. Appendix Table
A2 also indicated that college completion and years of education are more strongly related
to parental income, at a national level, than is the ELS college enrollment measure, further
indicating limitations of the latter.
Appendix Table A5 returns to the income transmission concept for ✓c , but explores
two alternative measures. One, labeled “later,” is the measure computed by CHKS for the
younger, 1983-5 birth cohorts, with adult incomes measured at younger ages. The second,
“causal” measure is constructed by Chetty and Hendren (forthcoming) based on families that
move from one CZ to another. Three dependent variables are considered: Children’s adult
family income (in percentiles, 0-100), children’s 12th grade math scores (also in percentiles),
and the child’s years of completed education as of age 26 (multiplied by 100). Results
iv

are generally similar across mobility measures; if anything, the alternative measures yield
weaker relationships with ELS transmission from parental income to children’s achievement
and attainment.

A.4

Robustness to scaling and additional controls

CHKS’s ✓c is strongly correlated with CZ-level racial composition, raising the possibility
that what appears to be variation in the transmission of parental income is in fact due to
diﬀerences in the omitted variable bias due to diﬀerences in the correlation of race with
parental income. Appendix Table A6 considers the same three outcomes considered earlier
along with the baseline CHKS mobility measure for the 1980-2 cohorts, but adds to this
base specification indicators for the child’s race and gender and, in columns 3, 6, and 9,
interactions of these with the income transmission measure. I do not present results for the
forward regression here, as with controls equation (7) is not valid. There is some evidence
here that race is an important factor – the standard deviation of income transmission implied
by the ELS data falls from 0.038 without controls to 0.023 when race is controlled and allowed
to interact with ✓c . However, the general conclusions that income transmission is positively
but weakly correlated with test score transmission, and somewhat more strongly correlated
with attainment transmission, are robust to the additional controls. There is no indication
that the omission of race leads me to substantially overstate the mediating role of human
capital.
Appendix Table A7 explores the sensitivity of my main test score transmission results
to diﬀerent scaling choices. In column 2, I use the child’s test score in standard deviations,
rather than in percentiles. Column 3 rescales the test score in terms of the predicted earnings
associated with that score, as in Bond and Lang (forthcoming). Columns 4 and 5 return
to using the test score percentile but rescale parental income, using first the log of parental
income and then a predicted test score percentile given parental income. While the scale of
the coeﬃcients varies across these columns, the general pattern that ⇡c is correlated around
0.3 with ✓c is robust to each of the alternative scalings.

A.5

Loosening the normality assumption

Most of my analysis is based on a mixed model, equation (12). I estimate this model by
maximum likelihood, under the assumption that ↵c and ⌘c are jointly normal, that ✏ic is also
normal and independent of the former two, and that all three are orthogonal to p̄c , pic
✓c , and the interactions p̄c ✓c and (pic

p̄c ,

p̄c ) ✓c . The normality restrictions are unattractive,

however.
In this appendix, I present an alternative, two-step estimator that does not rely on
normality. Unfortunately, it is very poorly behaved in the ELS sample.
Specifically, I estimate separate regressions of children’s test scores on parental income in
each CZ. Samples are quite small – the median CZ has 85 observations, but 10% of CZs have
fewer than 20 observations. I discard CZs with 10 or fewer observations, the 1st percentile of
the sample. For all other CZs, I estimate ⇡
ˆc and its associated standard error. In computing
the standard errors, I pool data from all CZs to estimate

2
✏,

the residual variance; I do not

take account of the multi-stage nature of the sample, which almost certainly leads me to
understate the sampling error in ⇡
ˆc .
Appendix Figure A2 plots the ⇡
ˆc estimates and their confidence intervals against ✓c .
While there is a correlation, it is diﬃcult to see in the graph, as the individual ⇡
ˆc estimates
are extremely noisy. A regression of ⇡
ˆc on ✓c yields coeﬃcient

= 0.13, notably smaller

than seen earlier but highly significant. The residual from this regression is ⌘ˆc . It equals
⌘c plus a sampling error component, the distribution of which is estimated by the standard
error of ⇡
ˆc . To estimate

2
⌘,

then, I compute the variance across CZs of ⌘ˆc and subtract the

component implied by the estimated standard errors:

In practice, this is negative – the average of (conservatively estimated) sampling variances
is larger than the total variance of the coeﬃcients (after removing the component explained
by ✓c ). I interpret this as an indication that the available sample is too small to support
this sort of exercise – the noise in the estimated sampling variances is too large relative

vi

to the signal we are attempting to extract from the estimated coeﬃcients. The exercise
can perhaps be interpreted as evidence that normality assumptions are not leading me to
understate . However, for the full variance decomposition and estimation of the forward
regression (7), there is no alternative for my purposes to the normality assumption imposed
in the main text.

A.6

Non-cognitive skills

Finally, Appendix Table A8 presents an analysis of children’s non-cognitive skills. These
are drawn from batteries included in the the ELS 10th grade survey (panel A), the ECLS
5th grade student survey (panel B), and the ECLS 5th grade teacher survey (panel C). The
specific measures are:

ELS 10th grade survey. Each of the measures used is created by principal factor analysis
from student responses to questions of the form “How often do these things apply to
you?”, with response options “almost never,” “sometimes,” “often,” and “almost always.”
Quotations are from National Center for Education Statistics (undated).

Instrumental motivation. Intended to capture “motivation to perform well academically in order to satisfy external goals like future job opportunities or financial
security.” Based on three responses about whether the student studies in order
to achieve long-run success.
General eﬀort and persistence. Based on five questions characterizing eﬀort put
into studying.
General control beliefs. Intended to capture “expectations of success in academic
learning.” Based on four responses characterizing the student’s self-perceived
ability to achieve desired academic outcomes.
Self eﬃcacy, math. Based on five responses characterizing the student’s self-perceived
ability to succeed in math classes and his/her views about the importance of innate ability in math.
Self eﬃcacy, reading. Based on five responses characterizing the student’s self-perceived
ability to succeed in reading classes.

ECLS 5th grade student survey. Students rated 42 statements about their perceptions
of themselves as “not at all true,” “a little bit true,” “mostly true,” and “very true.”
These were averaged into several scales. Quotations are from Tourangeau et al. (2006).

vii

Perceived interest / competence in reading. Eight statements concerning “reading grades, the diﬃculty of reading work, and [the student’s] interest in and
enjoyment of reading.”
Perceived interest / competence in math. Eight statements concerning “mathematics grades, the diﬃculty of mathematics work, and [the student’s] interest in
and enjoyment of mathematics.”
Perceived interest / competence in all school subjects. Six statements concerning “how well [the student] do[es] in ’all school subjects’ and [the student’s] enjoyment of ’all school subjects.” ’
Perceived interest / competence in peer relations. Six statements concerning
“how easily [the student] make[s] friends and get[s] along with children as well as
their perception of their popularity.”
Externalizing problem behaviors. Six statements concerning “externalizing problem behaviors such as fighting and arguing ’with other kids,’ talking and disturbing others, and problems with distractibility.”
Internalizing problem behaviors. Eight statements concerning “internalizing problem behaviors such as feeling ’sad a lot of the time,’ feeling lonely, feeling ashamed
of mistakes, feeling frustrated, and worrying about school and friendships."

ECLS 5th grade teacher survey. Teachers rated 26 statements about how often students
exhibited certain social skills and behaviors as “never,” “sometimes,” “often,” and “very
often.” These were averaged into several scales. Quotations are from Tourangeau et
al. (2006).

Approaches to learning. “Measures behaviors that aﬀect the ease with which children can benefit from the learning environment.” Based on seven items relating
to “the child’s attentiveness, tax persistence, eagerness to learn, learning independence flexibility, [] organization ... [and] child follows classroom rules.”
Self control. “Four items that indicate the child’s ability to control behavior by respecting the property rights of others, controlling temper, accepting peer ideas
for group activities, and responding appropriately to pressure from peers.”
Interpersonal skills. “Five items that rate the child’s skill in forming and maintaining friendships; getting along with people who are diﬀerent; comforting or
helping other children; expressing feelings, ideas, and opinions in positive ways;
and showing sensitivity to the feelings of others.”
Peer relations. This is a combination of the self-control and interpersonal scales.
Externalizing problem behaviors. This scale “includes acting out behaviors”: six
items “rate the frequency with which a child argues, fights, gets angry, acts impulsively, [] disturbs ongoing activities ... [and] talks during quiet study time.”
Internalizing problem behaviors. Four items ask about “the apparent presence of
anxiety, loneliness, low self-esteem, and sadness.”
viii

For all of the non-cognitive items, I reverse-code so that higher values are better, then convert
to percentiles. I also present results for an overall non-cognitive skill index from each survey.
To form this, I convert each listed scale to a z-score, average them, then convert the average
to percentiles.
Results are mixed. The

coeﬃcient on the parental income - CZ income transmission

interaction is generally small and not statistically significant, and frequently has the wrong
sign. For about half of the measures, there is statistically significant variation across CZs
in the return to parental income (i.e.,

⌘

6= 0). Overall, there is little indication that

non-cognitive skills are important mediators of income-to-income transmission. The ECLS
teacher survey results, however, tell a diﬀerent story, with strong associations with income
transmission. This is not due to the use of diﬀerent measures in the child and teacher
surveys – even when the concepts overlap (e.g., for externalizing problem behaviors), results
are quite diﬀerent. It is not clear how to account for this discrepancy. It may indicate that
teachers in high-transmission CZs tend to be more biased in their assessments of low-income
children, but this is quite speculative.

Notes: CZs are divided into deciles based on CHKS’s income transmission (relative mobility)
measure. Figure plots coefficients and 95% confidence intervals for regressions estimated
separately for each decile. In Panel A, the regression is of the child’s income percentile (y) on the
parent’s income percentile (p). In Panel B, it is of the child’s test score percentile (s) on p, as in
Figure 2. In Panels C and D, y is regressed on s and p; Panel C shows the s coefficients and Panel
D shows the p coefficients. Each regression includes CZ fixed effects and uses ELS sampling
weights. Dashed lines show unweighted regressions of the decile coefficients on the decile mean
income transmission; their slopes are shown in the lower right of each panel.
