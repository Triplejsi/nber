Wage Gaps and Output Gaps:
Is There a Common Story for All of Europe?

ABSTRACT

This paper studies the relationship between real wages and unemployment in
Europe. It finds no evidence that high real wages are responsible for the
differing behavior of unemployment in Europe as contrasted with the U. S., and
across European countries finds patterns of real wage behavior that are the
opposite of what would be required to link high real wages and high unemploy—
ment. Among the specific results are:

(1) After adjustment for the income of the self—employed, there is no
evidence of excessive real wages in Europe. "Wage gap" (i.e., labor's share)
indexes on a 1972 base were almost identical in Europe and the U. S. in 1963
and 1984. The slight bulge in the European wage gap between 1974 and 1978
amounts to only about five percentage points over the U. S. values.

(2) There was indeed a real wage explosion between 1966 and 1975 in

three small high—unemployment countries (Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands). But

the wage gap barely moved in the four large high-unemployment countries
(France, Germany, Italy, U. K.), and in fact increased substantially less than in
low—unemployment Austria. Thus the wage gap concept is almost useless in
providing an explanation of differences in unemployment experience within
Europe.

(3) Further skepticism regarding the relevance of wage and price adjust-

ment for the European unemployment problem is provided by aggregation tests.
Tests for pooling of wage change equations across national boundaries in Europe
are accepted universally. There are no significant differences in wage behavior
within Europe, except for country—specific instances of wage push or incomes
policies.

(4) The paper does not explain high unemployment in Europe, and it does
not deny that the natural unemployment rate compatible with a constant inflation
rate has increased substantially since 1972 in every European country.
However, output gaps in Europe are not zero. The econometric estimates imply
that the unemployment rate could be pushed down by three percentage points,
particularly in France and Germany, without causing an acceleration of inflation.

(5) Some might argue that wage gaps in Europe in the 1980s have been
pushed down by economic slack and would bounce back if unemployment fell
substantially. However, the claim that wage gaps have been held down by high
unemployment and low output in the 1980s amounts to an acceptance of one of
the major conclusions of this paper: Europe has experienced a substantial
Keynesian output gap in the 1980s, and not all of the increase in European
unemployment is "structural" or "classical" in nature.

I. INTRODUCTION

The Issues
Books and papers attempting to explain high European unemployment have

become a growth industry of their own. For almost every country in Europe,
estimates are available that decompose the post—1970 rise in unemployment

between demand and supply factors. Several ambitious studies attempt such a
decomposition for a large number of countries (especially Bean—Layard---Nickell
(1986), Bruno—Sacha (1981, 1985), Sachs (1979, 1983), and Bruno (1986)). Many

others (especially those assembled in Econornica 1986) carry out this task for a

single country. The consensus of this literature is that much of the rise in
unemployment in Europe has been caused by supply factors, in the sense that the
natural rate of unemployment or "NAIRU" has increased by half or more of the

total percentage point rise in actual unemployment. There is much less

consensus regarding the nature of the supply problem. Several papers by Bruno
and Sachs blame an increase in the "wage gap", that is, an index of labor's
income share, while other authors (especially Bean-Layard-Nickell) go beyond the

endogenous wage gap to deeper structural factors, such as an increasing
generosity of unemployment benefits, increasing skill and location mismatch in

the labor market, "labor militancy" due to increased union power, an increasing
tax "wedge," an absence of "corporatism", and other factors.
As its title suggests, this paper is about two aspects of the supply—demand
dichotomy, wage gaps and output gaps, for eleven European countries both
individually and collectively (for comparative purposes the U. S., Canada, and

Japan are included as well). For each country we calculate new measures of the
wage gap and ask whether, even if one is willing to waive the theoretical

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 2

objections

to the

concept, there is

any evidence that wage gaps in individual

European countries have increased enough to explain higher unemployment.

Further, we develop new measures of the output gap for each country, u8ing
econometric wage and price adjustment equations, and employing the two
hypotheses that "natural output" evolves as a trend between benchmark years and

alternatively according to the "hysteresis" hypothesis as a moving average of
actual output.
The case for supply—side unemployment in Europe has often been based on
alleged differences in the dynamics of wage and price adjustment between Europe
and the U. S. Since Sachs (1979) and Branson-Rotemberg (1980), Europe has

been said to exhibit "real wage rigidity", leading to an increase in the wage gap
in the wake of a productivity growth slowdown, while the U. S. has been said to
exhibit "nominal wage rigidity" that makes its aggregate supply curve relatively
flat and opens the way for vigorously stimulative aggregate demand policies.

The present paper builds on a companion study (Gordon, 1987) that rejected the
transatlantic real vs. nominal rigidity distinction in light of econometric evidence
that, for Europe as a whole (an aggregate of 11 countries), nominal wage and

price adjustment coefficients are similar to those in the U. S. and that,
furthermore, Europe's uniqueness consists not of real wage rigidity but rather
too much real wage flexibility at the time of the famous wage "explosions" of
the late 1960s.

That study looked at the behavior of an 11-country aggregate called

"Europe" but did not ask whether its bold aggregation was legitimate. This
paper takes the next essential step and inquires into differences among the Ii

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 3
countries. Does the apparent similarity of dynamic wage and price behavior in
Europe and the U. S. extend to all 11 countries, or are there systematic
differences between the four low—unemployment countries (Austria, Belgium,
Sweden, and Switzerland) and the remaining high—unemployment nations? The

common approach of other comparative studies is to estimate equations for each

country, one at a time, without ever inquiring whether differences among
countries are statistically significant. This paper makes a start at asking a new

and interesting question: is it necessary to divide econometric wage and price
equations into compartments corresponding to national boundaries, or rather can

the 11 countries be aggregated into a small number of subsets or even into one
grand European aggregate? And if there are subsets of countries that accept
aggregation or, more formally, "pooling" in a statistical sense, do the pooled
subsets have any common features along the dimensions of high unemployment,
hysteresis, or corporatisna?
The companion paper (1987) treated only a European aggregate in order to

allow space to investigate differences in behavior between the manufacturing and
nonmanufacturing sectors in the European aggregate, the U. S., and Japan. This

paper goes further by treating the 11 European countries individually at the
sacrifice of dropping the manufacturing_nonmanufacturing distinction, treating
only the entire economy without any sectoral disaggregatjon. Like the other

study, this paper not only estimates new wage and price equations but also, in
light of the central role of productivity growth in the interpretation of wage
gaps and real wage behavior, estimates new econometric productivity equations
that decompose ob8erved productivity behavior among cyclical effects, real—wage

substitution effects, and underlying secular trend effects. The estimated secular

Wage and Output

Gaps, Page 4

trends, in turn, are not forced to be constant over the postwar period but rather
are allowed to change both after 1972 and after 1979.
While wage, price, and productivity equations have been estimated by

numerous authors, the research undertaken here is unique in its data base,
econometric specification, and testing of aggregation across European national

boundaries. Almost all previous studies in this area have used data that are
inconsistent by sector, leading to regressions in which the wage rate in the
manufacturing sector is related to employment or unemployment in the aggregate
economy.' Yet in 1984 manufacturing value added was only 24 percent of total

output in the U. S. and 29 percent in Europe. In contrast, this study is based
on a consistent data base in which time series for 14 countries over the 1961—84
interval have been developed for the aggregate economy. The data series
available for all 14 countries include such variables as real value added, the
value added deflator, compensation per hour, employment, and hours per
employee.2

A further innovation in the data base corrects an error in previous
measures of the wage gap or "labor's share." While employment and person—
hours data include not only employees but also the self—employed, the income of
the self-employed is included in the official OECD national accounting system as

part of capital's toporating surplus" rather than as part of the income of labor.
When the income of the self-employed, which the OECD calls "household

entrepreneurial income" is added to the compensation of employees and treated
as part of labor's income share, the secular increase in labor's share in Europe

and Japan, to which Bruno and Sachs have previously called attention, disappears

almost entirely.3 Rather than criticizing the concept of the wage gap upon

Wage and Output Gaps,

Page

5

which previous investigators have based their claim that much European
unemployment is "classical," this paper shows that the properly measured wage

gap shows little if any secular increase not just in the U. S., but also in Japan
and in most European countries.
The econometric specification builds on my own past research for the U. S.
and differs markedly from most other work on these issues. Since observed

unempioymert rates incorporate both cyclical demand fluctuations and a secular
increase due to some variety of supply factors, raw unadjusted unemployment

rates are an illegitimate measure of demand pressure. Or, stated another way, it

is inconsistent to start out a study treating the raw unemployment rate as a
measure of cyclical pressure, which implies that the natural rate of
unemployment is constant, and finish up a study concluding that the natural rate
of unemployment has risen substantjafly'4 Yet to impose some decomposition
between the demand and supply components of unemployment ox ante in order to
construct an unemployment—based cyclical measure presupposes an answer to the

basic question that all such studies are attempting to address. To avoid this
pitfall, in this paper the measure of cyclical variability that enters the
productivity, wage, and price equations is not the level of unemployment but
rather sectoral output detrended by the "trends-through-benchmarks" method (the

"output gap"). All equations are estimated in first differences rather than levels
in order to avoid spurious correlations among variables (especially productivity
and the real wage) that display common changes in trend. Special attention is
given to the response of real wage changes to the productivity growth slowdown

that has occurred everywhere, an issue that is ignored in the majority of studies
that include only a single constant term in equations explaining wage changes,

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 6
and yet is essential in testing the hypothesis that real wage growth in Europe
was too "rigid" to respond to the post-1973 productivity growth slowdown. Wage
and price equations are based on the assumption of disequilibrium labor market
adjustment, in contrast to some work (especially Newell—SymonS 1985) based on a
market—clearing interpretation.

This paper takes the "output gap" (the log ratio of actual real GDP to
"natural." real GDP) as the basic measure of cyclical demand pressure and
measures "naturalt' real GNP by trends through the benchmark years 1961, 1972,
and 1979, with the 1972-79 rate of growth extrapolated to 1984. By taking 1979

as a benchmark year in which natural real GNP is assumed to be equal to actual
real GNP (with a zero output gap), this paper

at all for this i. This is evident in Table 1, which displays standardized
unemployment rates for each country for the benchmark years 1961, 1972, and
l979. Since we assume that cyclical demand pressure was zero for all countries
in 1979, we assume that between 1972 and 1979 there were major unexplained

increases in the natural unemployment rate for France, Germany, Belgium,
Denmark, and the Netherlands. Lesser but nontrivial increases in the rate

occurred in Canada, Japan, Italy, the U. K., and Austria. The natural rate
assumed in 1984 cannot be read from this table; in the concluding section of the
paper a calculation is provided that works backward from our measure of the
output gap to arrive at a measure of the natural. rate of unemployment for each
country in 1984.

Themes T.rg
The most interesting new result in this paper is that national boundaries

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 7
within Europe are no longer relevant in studying wage behavior. In a step—by—

step test of pooling across pairs of European countries, and then alternative
pairs of country—groups, we find no single case in which a regression pooled

across country boundaries fits worse (using the usual 5 percent significance

criterion) than regressions estimated for separate members of each pair. These

results raise serious doubts about a large segment of the literature on high
European unemployment, particularly those papers which attribute low
unemployment in some countries to "corporatist" wage—setting institutions, and

those which blame excess real wage increases in some countries for their high
unemployment.

Confirming my recent work, the results cast doubt on most of the contrasts
between the U. S. and Europe that have received heavy emphasis in previous

research, not only for the aggregate of 11 European countries studied in Gordon
(1987), but also for most individual European countries. With the single

exception of the U. K., there is no evidence to support Sachs' (1983) claim that

productivity in Europe is "classical," varying countercylically. Further, there is
remarkably little evidence of greater nominal wage flexibility in Europe than in

the U. S., or of greater real-wage rigidity in Europe.
The apparent consensus that European real wages are excessive is simplistic;

in 1984 the wage gap (an index of labor's share on a 1972 base) for an
aggregate of 11 European countries was as low as the U. S. wage gap and lower
in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Norway. There is absolutely no relation
across European countries between those that have high unemployment in the

1980s and those that exhibit high wage gaps. The highest wage gaps adjusted
for estimated productivity trends are all in low—unemployment countries, Japan,

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 8
Austria, and Switzerland.

The wage and price equations estimated in the paper address the common
distinction between real wage rigidity in Europe and nominal wage rigidity in the
U. S. (see especially Branson-Rotemberg 1980).

We find that the bulge in the

wage gaps of Europe and Japan in the 1970s is not due primarily to a failure of
real wages to decelerate in response to the post—1973 productivity growth

slowdown, but rather results in large part from episodes of autonomous "wage

push" in Europe in the late 1960s and in Japan during 1973—74. In this sense,

real wages in Europe and Japan were too flexib1 rather than too rgid.
The paper also reveals an interesting dichotomy between large and small

countries within Europe. There is little degenerate behavior evident in the
statistical evidence for the large countries —— no countercyclical productivity

behavior that would suggest a deterioration in productivity gains in reponse to a
future output stimulus (except in the U. K.); no evidence of substantial excessive
real wage changes between the mid-1960s and mid- or late-1970s; and no

evidence of a substantially steeper aggregate supply curve that would inhibit
policymakers from administering a demand stimulus. But several small countries

exhibit signs of excessive real wage increases through the late 1970s, followed by

a rapid readjustment since then. The paper points to, but does not solve, a
puzzle in the high "wage gap" indexes of some small countries that have
relatively low unemployment (especially Austria and Switzerland) in contrast to
the relatively low level of wage gap indexes in other high—unemployment

countries, especially Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands.

The Data Base for 14 Countries
Most comparative econometric studies of wage and employment equations

have indiscriminately mixed data on the hourly wage rate for the manufacturing
sector with economy—wide data on unemployment and/or output.6 The work of
Artus (1984) is almost unique in developing a consistent data base for

manufacturing, and this paper builds on his research by developing an analogous

data base for the aggregate economy. The aim of the data compilation is to
develop consistent series on value added, the value added deflator, compensation,
employment, and hours per employee. These series allow the calculation of all of

the variables that matter for a study of productivity, wage, and price behavior.

Average labor productivity is real value added per labor hour, the wage rate is
compensation per labor hour, and the wage gap is the nominal wage rate, divided

by the value added deflator, divided in turn by average labor productivity.
Because the real product wage relevant for the hiring decisions of business firms

is expressed at factor cost, i.e., net of indirect taxes, special care has been
taken to achieve a consistent set of net—of—tax product price deflators at factor
cost.

The aggregate data are developed here from published OECD series,

together with a crucial unpublished series on aggregate hours per employee.7
A unique feature of the data base is the explicit treatment of self—employment

income. Previous studies have included in indexes of labor's income share and
the "wage gap" only the compensation of employees. But the income of the self—

employed consists mainly of labor income and should also be included rather than

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 10
being hidden, as at present, in the OECD's umbrella capital income measure

called "the operating surplus." This is particularly important in this study, which
measures the wage rate as compensation per hour. Since measures of
employment and total hours include the self—employed, so should the measure of

compensation. Thus our measure of total compensation adds the OECD measure
of "household entrepreneurial income" to employee compensation.

Potential defects in these procedures may be enumerated briefly. The
use of compensation per hour to represent the wage rate has the advantage that
separate wage rate series can be developed for the aggregate, manufacturing, and
nonmanufacturing sectors, but has the disadvantage that any compensation per

hour series displays cyclical fluctuations created not by changes in the "pure"
wage itself, but also by changes in the fraction of hours paying overtime rates,
and by changes in the interindustry mix between high and low wage activities.
While my past work on U. S. wage behavior has been based on an hourly

earnings index adjusted for shifts in overtime and the iriterindustry employment
mix, such indexes are not available for other countries, and thus the need for

consistency requires use of an unadjusted compensation per hour series for each
country and each sector. The addition of self—employment income to employee

compensation also raises issues that require further research, including the
separation of the labor and capital components of entrepreneurial income.

We need to identify secular trends in productivity growth for five purposes.
First, measures of the 'wage gap" should be corrected for cyclical variations in

productivity, relating the level of real wages to the secular trend in productivity.
Second, identifying the concept of "real wage rigidity" in a dynamic wage—change

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 11

regression

cannot be accomplished without some measure of "rigid relative to

what?" Third, most evidence for the U. S. suggests that prices are set relative

to "trend unit labor cost," that is, wages divided by the trend in labor's average
product, rather than relative to actual unit labor cost. Fourth, the cyclical
productivity regressions developed in this section also allow us to assess the
effect of real wage movements on the demand for labor and on labor's average

product. Fifth, our equations allow us to assess the claim by Sachs that "in
Europe (but not in Japan) the overall effect of a sustained rise in unemployment

is to raise productivity relative to trend" (1983, p. 281). His claim that labor
productivity varies countercyclically in Europe contrasts with the standard
assumption in the U. S. that productivity varies procyclically.

The basic specification relates the log ratio of hours to trend output (Ni —
Q*t)

to the log output ratio (Qt -

Q*t),

representing the cyclical effect of

output on hiring decisions; to the real wage rate defined relative to the
underlying productivity trend [(Wt -

Pt)

-

e*t], which could differ from zero as

a result of excess growth in the real wage; and to the productivity trend itself
(e*t). Defining all upper—case letters as logs of levels, we can write:
(1)

(Nt — Q*t)

A + +(Qt — Q*t)

—

a(Wt

—

Pt

—

where A is a constant. Note that (1) adds a cyclical effect to a standard static
labor demand function in which labor hours depend on the real wage and labor—

augmenting technical progress. The trend in (1) picks up the effects of growth
in the capital-labor ratio and of changes in other inputs.

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 12
When (1) is rewritten as an equation for the average product of labor
(Q/N), we can interpret the parameter • as indicating the effect of cyclical
movements in the output ratio on labor productivity:

If the parameter 4 is unity, then a permanent increase in the output ratio has no
impact on actual labor productivity, whereas a value of $ below unity implies a
permanent productivity gain ("short—run increasing returns") and a value of $
above unity implies a permanent productivity loss ("short—run diminishing

returns"). Thus the Sacha phenomenon of countercyclical productivity movements

in Europe requires an estimated value of •

>

1.0.

We note that (1) allows us to define a wage gap concept adjusted not just
for cyclical effects but for the endogenous reponse of productivity growth to
excess growth in the real wage. Defining 6 as the log level of labor's actual

average product and 6* as the growth rate of the trend in labor's average
product, we can write the actual wage gap index (WGt) as Wt - Pt 6t and the
—

adjusted wage gap index (WG*t) as Wt — Pt

—

e*t.

Using these definitions, we

can rearrange (2) to obtain:
(3)

WGt

A — (1—4)(Qt

Q*t) + (1cs)(WGtt).

This expression places an interesting perspective on the interrelationships
between real wage behavior, productivity growth, and the wage gap index. If

the elasticity of labor input with respect to the excess real wage (cs) in (1) is

unity, then (3) shows that the excess real wage growth "pays for itself" by

preliminary tests an additional productivity term (

1.0 during 1980—84)

was entered to test for the significance of a second growth slowdown after

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 14

1979, but this term was uniformly insignificant in the presence of the real wage

variable. With the real wage variable omitted,

was significant for several

countries, as discussed below in connection with Table 4.

Results for the productivity regression equations are presented in Table 2
for the fourteen countries, with countries listed in the same order as Table I
(North America and Japan at the top, followed by the four large European

countries and then the seven small European countries). All sums of coefficients

on the output ratio are between zero and unity except for the U. K, indicating
almost uniformly procyclical behavior of productivity. Only the U. K. exhibits a
countercyclical effect; the U. S., Canada, France, Germany, and Switzerland

exhibit a mildly procyclical effect; and there are strongly procyclical effects in

Japan, Italy, and all of the small European countries except Switzerland. The
bottom line for a GNP-weighted aggregate of all 11 European countries displays

the interesting result that the labor hoarding (or procyclical productivity)
phenomenon is somewhat more important in Europe than in the U. S., directly
contradicting Sachs' (1983) results.

The real wage elasticities have the correct negative sign and are
statistically significant in all the countries but the U. S., U. K., Norway, and
Sweden.

Most of the elasticities are in the vicinity of —0.5, indicating that an

increase in wages relative to the productivity trend, for whatever reason, boosts

productivity by enough to offset about half but not all of the resulting upward
pressure on the wage gap (recall that an elasticity of 1.O would be required for
the wage gap to be unaffected by an acceleration of wage growth relative to

Wage and Output Caps, Page 15
trend productivity growth). It seems ironic, in light of the emphasis placed on
real—wage substitution in the labor market by British authors, including BeanLayard—Nickell (1986) and Newell—Symons (1985), that the country with the least

evidence of a real wage effect is the U. l{. There seems to be no connection
between the real wage elasticity and the post-1970 rise in unemployment.

Relatively high elasticities are found for countries with high unemployment rates
in the 1980s (France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Denmark) and low unemployment

rates in the 1980s (Japan, Austria, Switzerland). Interestingly, the elasticity for
Europe as a whole is almost identical to that in Japan.
The productivity trend terms displayed in Table 2 are the

coefficients

that must be unscrambled, using equation (6), to reveal the underlying structural
productivity trends (e*). As displayed in Table 2, the productivity coefficients
are useful mainly as an indication of the statistical significance of the post—1972

slowdown in productivity growth. Somewhat surprisingly, the slowdown terms in
column (4) of Table 2 are significant only for Japan, Austria, Sweden, and

Switzerland. For all the other countries but Norway, the slowdown terms have

the correct positive sign but are insignificant at the 5 percent level.
Table 3 presents an extremely interesting decomposition of the fitted values
of actual growth rate of productivity in three periods (1964—72, 1972-79, and

1979-84), subdividing the growth rate that the Table 2 equations explain into

three sources, (a) underlying trend, (b) contribution of real wage changes (the
w—p - E e* term in equation (4)), and (c) the contribution of changes in the

output ratio. The total shown in columns (4), (8), and (12) is for the fitted
value of the equations from Table 2. Recall that the post1972 trend effect is
the sum of columns (3) and (4) in Table 2, with the signs reversed, as written

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 16

out

in equation (6).
The countries can be divided into groups, according to the main sources of

changes in observed productivity growth. The first group consists of those
countries in which the observed slowdown in productivity growth after 1972 is

mainly explained by the underlying trend term: the U. S., Japan, the U. K.,
Austria, Sweden, and Switzerland. For the second group of countries the 1972—

79 slowdown is mainly explained by the trend term, but a further large slowdown
in 1979—84 is explained by a slowdown in real wage growth (Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden).

Further large contributions of the output ratio after 1979 occur in Italy, Austria,
the Netherlands, and Norway.

For Europe as a whole, aLl of the slowdown in productivity growth after

1979 is attributed to the real wage and cyclical effects. The U. S. has less of a
real—wage effect after 1979, both because the coefficient on real wages is smaller

in Table 2, and because the slowdown in real wage growth was less dramatic

than in Europe. For Japan the dominant fact is the slower post-1972 trend, and
the real—wage effect is relatively minor, contributing a positive half percentage
point in 1972—79 which was reversed in 1979—84.

Table 4 brings together the assumed trend growth rates of output (based on
the benchmark years 1961, 1972, and 1979, as explained on p. 6 above) with

estimated trend growth rates of productivity. Unlike those displayed in Table 3,
the

productivity trends in Table 4 are obtained from estimates of equation (4) in

which the real wage effects are omitted. These trends can be interpreted as
incorporating a cyclical adjustment but no decomposition of the portion of the

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 17

productivity

trend attributable to real wage movements. When (4) is reestimated

without the real wage variable, the third dummy variable representing the post—
1979 slowdown becomes significant only for Germany, the Netherlands,

Switzerland, and the aggregate of ii European countries. (Tables showing these
regression results with the third dummy variable are omitted to save space).

The purpose of Table 4 is to shed some light on the sources of the
divergent movements of European unemployment rate from the unemployment

rates of the U. S. and Japan. The counterpart of rising unemployment is, of
course, slow or negative growth in labor hours. Obviously some part of the
European unemployment problem results froth output falling below trend, with log

output ratios in Europe for 1984 of -8.8 percent, as compared with —5.3 percent

in the U. S. and an assumed ratio of zero for Japan. Within Europe, the largest
negative output ratios were for the Netherlands (-13.2 percent) and France
(—11.5 percent).

Leaving aside questions of utilization, however, it is also possible to look at

the implications for labor hours of the underlying trends in output and

productivity. Taken together, the output and productivity growth trends imply
trends for labor input, shown in columns (3), (6), and (9) of Table 4. Aggegate
European trend hours fell in both periods before 1979 and actually rose slightly

in the 1980s, but at a much slower rate than in the U. S. and a slightly slower
rate than in Japan. However, the European aggregate disguises divergent hours
trends among the 11 countries for 1979—84, ranging from +1.68 percent in the

Netherlands to -1.43 percent in neighboring Belgium. in the four large European
countries, the hours trend after 1979 was close to zero ——not far from the

Japanese trend in Germany and Italy, and somewhat less in France and the U. K.

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 18
Table 4 places an interesting perspective on the U. S. phenomenon of rapid

hours growth. Part of the U. S. difference from Europe stems from a lower
decline in hours per employee (at a rate of about —0.25 percent per year as
contrasted with —0.9 percent per year since 1972). However, most stems from

faster employment growth. One can view the U. S. success in achieving rapid
employment growth, however, as the counterpart of its dismal productivity

record. One can calculate that if the U. S. had achieved the existing growth
rate of output in 1979-84 but had combined it with European trend productivity

growth, the U. S. would have had 8 percent fewer hours of labor input, or 9

million addiionalunemploy (ignoring effects on labor force participation and
hours per employee).

We now turn to the estimates of the wage gap. For this purpose we return
to the productivity growth trends from equation (4), which includes changes in

the real wage as a determinant of the growth rate of hours relative to output.
In Table 5a we display the actual wage gap index (WGt), or Wt -

Pt

-

Ott

which

is simply a calculation from the data of an index of labor's share (including self-employment income) and which does not rely on any regression estimates. This
is compared in Table 5b with the adjusted wage gap index (WG*t), or Wt — Pt
e*t,

—

that is, the real wage divided by the productivity trend estimated in Table 2

and displayed in Table 3.

The raw data in Table 5a will astonish readers of previous studies by
Bruno—Sachs and others. Since the European unemployment problem emerged

after 1972, the wage gap index is expressed as 1972

1.0 (as compared to a base

of 1965-69 for Bruno-Sacha). Of the 112 wage gap indexes displayed in Table 5a,

Wage and Output Qaps, Page 19
only two are greater than 1.10, and these are both for Austria, one of the low—
unemployment countries. Such high—unemployment countries as the U. K.,

Belgium, Denmark, and the Netherlands display relatively small increases in the

actual wage gap (WGt) index in Table 5a. Of particular interest are the 1984
data: only three countries have 1984 wage gap indexes on a 1972 base equal to
or greater than 1.01, and these are all low—unemployment countries, Japan,
Austria, and Switzerland!

The adjusted wage gap (WG*t) in Table 5b displays the familiar "hump-

shaped" time path, with a peak for most countries in 1976 or 1978, and a marked
decline from 1978 to 1984. The only three countries with a 1984 wage gap index
greater than 1.00 are the same three low—unemployment nations, Japan, Austria,

and Switzerland. While the adjusted indexes support the previous research of
Bruno and Sachs that has shown a substantial increase in wage gaps between the
mid—1960s and mid—1970s, there are numerous interesting differences with the

Bruno—Sacha estimates. These are summarized in the following in—text table,

which compares the 1966-75 wage gap increases from Tables 5a and 5b with the
most recent adjusted wage gaps published by Michael Bruno (1986, p. S40). The

following table compares Bruno's adjusted wage gap indexes in 1976 with ours in

1975, both unadjusted and adjusted:

Looking first just at the comparison of the unadjusted and adjusted wage gap
indexes from Tables 5a and Sb, we note that the productivity adjustment does
not make much difference except for the three small European high—
unemployment countries, Belgium, Denmark, and the Netherlands. Here there are

huge increases in the wage gap during 1966-75 once the productivity adjustment

is applied. We note in Table 2 that these countries all have relatively large
elasticities of labor hours to excess growth in the real wage, and so the
relatively small increases in the unadjusted wage gap (WGi) occur because excess
wage increases "pay for themselves," raising productivity enough to create only a
minimal increase in the wage gap.

The differences between our adjusted wage gap indexes in Table Sb and

Bruno's measures of the same concept display an important difference. For
North America, Japan, and all the large European countries our 1966—75 increases
are all lower than his 1965—76 differences. Our average index for North America

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 21
and Japan is 1.008 compared to his 1.079; our average for the four large

European countries is 1.046 compared to his 1.122. Only for the small European
countries are his estimated 1965—76 differences larger; our average index of 1.155

can be compared to his of 1.104. This discrepancy is almost entirely due to the

Netherlands. If our estimate for the Netherlands is substituted for his, his
estimated 1965—76 index becomes 1.177.

It is beyond the scope of this paper to search in detail for the sources of
the discrepancy between these estimates and Bruno's. 1. would speculate that the

sources involve three areas: (1) Bruno and Sachs in the past have used data
from a secondary source, the U. S. BLS, rather than creating their own series
from primary national accounts data; (2) we include self—employment income as

part of labor's share, and it is not clear than Bruno and Sachs do so; and
finally (3) our post-1972 estimated productivity growth rate trends may be more
rapid than those used by Bruno.9

Table 5b raises difficult substantive questions for proponents of the
hypothesis that European unemployment is classical, in the sense that real wages
are excessive as measured by the adjusted wage gap index. None of the four
large European countries seems to have experienced a marked increase in the

real wage relative to the underlying productivity trend, yet all have experienced
high unemployment in the 1980s. As early as 1981, before wage rates could have
been held down substantially by negative demand pressure, all four large
European countries exhibited adjusted wage gap indexes below 1.00 on a 1972
base.

The most promising evidence in Table Sb for the wage gap proponents is
the very large 1966-75 increases exhibited by the three European countries which

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 22

are

both relatively small and which have experienced relatively high

unemployment in the 1980s, Belgium, Denmark, and the Netherlands. But in

itself this is puzzling. Why should high unemployment be caused by high real
wages in small countries, when unemployment is almost as high in large European
countries without excessive real wages?
Further questions are raised by the dramatic nose—dive of the wage gap

indexes from 1978 to 1984 in every country, on both an adjusted and unadjusted

basis. As our estimated wage equations suggest below in Table 7, there are
positive effects of demand pressure on real wages, so that much of the decline

in the wage gap in the 1980s can be attributed to negative output gaps (i.e., an
actual unemployment rate above the natural unemployment rate). But then this
interpretation is completely inconsistent with the "hysteresis" hypothesis recently
advanced by Blanchard-Summers (1986) and others. If the natural unemployment

rate has marched upward in tandem with the actual unemployment rate, as

suggested by the hysteresis hypothesis, then there was little orioutçj
in1984, and hence noexplanoji for the rapid downward adjustment of real
wages relative to productivity that has occurred in the 1980s. Our
interpretation, developed more formally below, is that there has been plenty of

slack, and that wage gaps have collapsed as a direct result of output gaps.
Looking just at the wage gap indexes for the U. S., Japan, and the
aggregate of all 11 European countries, it is hard to see how the minor
differences in these indexes could be responsible for the substantial differences
among the three economies in the evolution of unemployment rates since the
1960s. Comparing 1963 and 1984, the U. S. and European adjusted wage gap
indexes in Table 5b are basically identical, and the 1979—84 decline of 6.3

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 23
percentage points in the U. S. was actually less than the 9.6 percentage-point
decline in Europe. The Japanese story seems to have been one of a jump in the
wage gap index as a result of the 1973-74 wage push, followed by moderation
that returned the index almost to its 1972 value by 1984.
III. WAGE AND PRICE EQUATIONS

In previous research (Gordon 1985, 1987) I have shown how a dynamic
disequilibrium wage adjustment equation of the expectational Phillips curve type

can be derived from static labor supply and demand equations, together with the
hypothesis that wages adjust to eliminate any gap between labor demand and

supply at a speed that is proportional to the size of the gap.'° The wage
change equation based on this formulation is joined by a price mark—up equation

that sets the level of the product price equal to a weighted average of trend
unit labor cost and import prices, with an allowance for a cyclically sensitive
mark—up. A third equation, called the "reduced—form", is specified as the

solution when the wage change equation is substituted into the first—difference
form of the mark-up equation. The model is specified without any lagged wage

terms in the wage equation, and so the rate of wage change is "solved out" in
the reduced—form, which includes lagged price change terms as well as all the

other variables that appear in either the wage change or mark—up equations.
Rather than repeat that theoretical analysis, this paper moves directly to
the econometric specification, based on a dynamic theoretical equation that
relates the change in wages relative to trend productivity to (a) the expected

rate of product price inflation, (b) the log output ratio, (c) the change in import

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 24
prices relative to the domestic GNP deflator, (d) the total rate of change in
three tax rates (indirect, income, and payroll), and (e) a "wage push" factor

defined in the theoretical analysis as the difference between the rate of change
of the "aspiration" wage demanded by workers and the growth rate of
productivity relevant for price-setting (the e* term estimated in Table 2 above).
The following section sets out the main decisions that are made in converting
the theoretical model into an econometric specification.

1. Basic fornat. All equations express every variable (other than the log
output ratio variable) as first differences of logs.
The expected inflation term is proxied by two
2. Expc
lags on the annual change in the value—added deflator. Two lags appear to be
sufficient to explain the wage changes without including a third or further lags,
while the "zero" lag (current price change) is excluded to avoid simultaneity and
identify the wage and price equations (i.e., the current change in unit labor cost
is entered into the price mark—up equations, but the current change in price is

not entered into the wage equations). This treatment reflects the (structural)
assumption that wages can influence prices within the current year more than
prices can influence wages, and the high degree of simultaneity between annual
changes in wages and prices is attributed to the price—setting process.11 The

theoretical wage equation calls for the expected price change term to enter with
a unitary coefficient; the wage equations are estimated below with the sum of
coefficients on the two lagged price change terms both estimated freely and also
constrained to equal unity.
3•

It has been customary in previous studies

to designate the unemployment rate or its inverse as the sole demand pressure

Wage and

Output Gaps, Page 25

variable. However, in theory it is not the level of the unemployment rate that
matters, but rather the excess demand for labor, which should be measured as

the deviation of the actual from the natural unemployment rate. If the natural
unemployment rate has risen, as seems to have occurred in most countries, the
use of the unemployment rate to measure excess demand introduces measurement

error. The procedure used here is to take advantage of the regular "Okun's
Law" relationship observed in many countries (Gordon, 1984; Hamada—Kurosaka,
1983) in the form of a high negative correlation between the log ratio of actual

to "natural" output (log Q - log Q*) and the deviation of the actual from the
natural unemployment rate. The required natural output series consists of
exponential trends running between the benchmark years of 1961, 1972, and 1979,
with the 1972—79 trend extended to 1984 on the assumption that most countries

were operating below natural output after 1979 and hence that no benchmark
year is available for the 1980s.12

4. Tax Rates. Three tax rates are available for each country, indirect,
payroll, and income. There are insufficient degrees of freedom to include all
three tax change terms in annual equations for the short 1964—84 interval.

Instead, the rate of change of the total indirect, payroll, and personal tax rates

is entered as a single variable. The change in the total tax rate (tT) is
calculated at an annual rate over two years, rather than one year, to allow for
lags without using up an extra degree of freedom.
5. Wage Push or Real Wage Rgidity. The theoretical wage change
equation allows for the possibility that the "aspiration" real wage rate rises more

rapidly than the rate of productivity growth (0*) relevant for price setting; this
could reflect either real wage stickiness in response to a slowdown in

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 26
productivity growth, or an autonomous episode of "wage push" that is not

captured by the other terms in the wage equation.
The real—wage rigidity or wage push effect, which we can call the "excess
change" in the real wage, is measured by a set of dummy variables. These

appear in the specification of the wage equation below in (7), designated by the
notation Dt. The first such dummy variables (Dit) is simply a constant term for
the full sample period. The theoretical specification contains no constant term

(since the log output ratio is defined to be zero when there is flO demand
pressure that would make trend unit labor cost——the dependent variable——differ
from expected product price inflation). Thus a significant positive value for the
constant term would indicate that, on average over the sample period, the
change in the real wage rate is larger than the trend growth rate of

productivity, after taking account of the effect of the other variables in the
equation (the log output ratio, the relative import price change, and tax
changes). Additional dummy variables are also entered for the

1973—84 (D2t) and

1980—84 (Dat) periods to test for the excess change in the real wage during
different intervals of the sample period. The sum of the constant and the 1973-

84 dummy indicates for the 1973-79 period the excess change in the real wage
(measured as an annual rate of change), while the sum of the constant, the
1973-84 dummy, and the 1980-84 dummy indicates the excess change for the

1980—84 interval. This interpretation of the excess change in the real wage
requires that the sum of coefficients on the lagged product price change terms
(pt-i and pt-2) is constrained to equal unity.

The wage equations are estimated

both with and without the set of constants and dummy variables
In previous research on European wage setting behavior Nordhaus (1972)

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 27
identified a "wage explosion" in the late 1960s, and this episode of autonomous

wage push was confirmed later by Perry (1975) and Gordon (1977a). To isolate
this episode, an additional dummy variable is included in the European wage
equations, defined as 1.0 for the years 1968—70 and zero otherwise. While there

have been no wage explosions in the U. S., the time paths of wages and prices
were displaced by the Nixon wage and price controls period in 1971-72 and
subsequent post-controls "rebound" in 1974—75. This displacement is captured by
a single dummy variable defined as 1.0 in 1971—72, —1.0 in 1974—75, and zero

otherwise. The fit of the Japanese wage equations is markedly improved when
the period 1973—74 is treated as a period of wage explosion in that country,
captured by a dummy variable equal to 1.0 for 1973—74 and zero otherwise.
For Europe, wage—push and controls dummy variables have been defined as

follows. For Germany and Italy, there is a single dummy variable equal to 1.0 in

1970 and 0.0 otherwise, to take account of the wage push that occurred during
the 1969—70 period (often described as the 1969 "hot autumn" in Italy). In

France there is one dummy variable defined as 1.0 during 1968, the year of the
general strike and the Grenelle Agreement (and 0.0 otherwise), and a second
dummy variable defined as 1.0 during 1982, the year most affected by the

Mitterand wage-push policies. The U. K. is by far the most complicated to

handle, particularly in annual data. Following our previous work, we treat the
1970 wage explosion as a rebound from the previous period of "restraint" andn
define a dummy variable equal to +1/3 in 1967—69 and —1 in 1970; the second U.

K. dummy variable required at the time of the 1976—78 "social contract" is
defined as +1/2 in 1976—77 and —1/2 in 1978—79.

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 28
The preceding discussion suggests the following wage equation, in which the

dependent variable is the rate of change of trend unit labor cost:
(7)

wt —

Ot

ciipt—i + i2pt2 + £X2OQt + 21Qt—1 + C3(P'—P)t

+ c4(t)t + c5D't + coDot + ciDit + c2D2t.

Here t is the output ratio, tTt is the change in the total tax rate, D"t is the
wage push or controls dummies, and the dummy variables designated Dt measure
the presence of excess real wage change for the periods 1964-84, 1972—84, and

1980—84. The inclusion of the lagged as well as current output ratio term allows

the effect of aggregate demand to enter either as a level effect, rate of change
effect, or both. In Table 7 below, this specification of the wage change
equation is estimated first with the Dit terms omitted and with the coefficients
on the lagged price terms freely estimated, and then a second time with the Dt

terms included and the constraint imposed that ii + 12

1.0.

The wage change equation is supplemented by an equation that explains
changes in the value—added deflator, based on the mark—up hypothesis, which can

be estimated in the straightforward form:
(8)

Pt

io(w._e*)t + ti(w—e)t-i + 2Ot + 21Qt-1

+ a(p"—p)t + 4tTt + 5D't.
The wage—push/controls dummy variables are entered exactly as in the wage

equations. In the case of Europe and Japan, the coefficient

might be

negative if an autonomous wage push squeezed profit margins, while in the U. S.
that coefficient could have either sign since, since the 1971—72 controls program

applied to price mark-ups as well as wage rates.

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 29
The final equation to be estimated is the reduced—form that results when
the theoretical wage—change equation is substituted into the price—mark—up

equation. To simplify the presentation of the reduced form, the complex set of
lagged coefficients is relabelled (e.g., Vii ioaii), and several lagged terms

that are indicated by the substitution are dropped to save degrees of freedom:
(9)

pt

Viipt—i + Vi2pt—2 + V2OQt + V2iQt-j + Va(pF_p)t

+ V4tTt + V5D't + oDot + iDjt + 2D2t.

Notice that the productivity trend term (6*t) drops out of the reduced—form, but
included are the three dummy variables (Dt) that measure the presence of excess
real wage change for the periods 1964-84, 1972—84, and 1980—84. The reduced—

form price change equation (9) is estimated first with the Dt terms omitted and
with the coefficients on the lagged price terms freely estimated, and then a
second time with the D1t terms included and the constraint imposed that Vu +
1.0.

If any of the three & coefficients are significantly positive, this
would indicate that excess real wage change created an acceleration of inflation,
V12

and indirectly an increase in the natural rate of unemployment.
Means and Standard Deviations

As a preliminary to presenting the estimates of the wage and price markup equations, Table 6 presents sample means and standard deviations of the main

variables for the periods before and after 1972. Without describing all the
figures in detail, several generalizations are evident from an inspection of the

table. First, rates of change of trend unit labor cost and of the GNP deflator
are relatively similar in each period for each country, reflecting the absence of
any major change in the adjusted wage gap indexes. Second, both wage changes

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 30
(net of productivity growth) and inflation rates are higher in the second period
than the first, with the notable exceptions of Germany (for wage change), the
Netherlands, and Switzerland (for inflation).

The third observation is that the log output ratio for most countries is

positive in the first period and negative in the second (with a close similarity
between the U. S. and the European aggregate). Fourth, the relative price of
imports was strongly negative in the first period for all countries, helping to
contribute to low inflation and low unemployment, while the reverse was true

everywhere but in Austria, Norway, and Switzerland in the second period.

We now turn to estimates of the equation for wage change, specified as in
(7) above. For variables where a string of lagged values is entered, only the
sum of coefficients is exhibited in Table 7, as in Table 2 above. Asterisks
designate the significance of coefficients or sums of coefficients.

Two estimates of the wage equation are presented in Table 7 for each
country. The first omits the "excess real wage growth" dummy variables and

freely estimates the coefficients on lagged price change. The second includes
the dummy variables and constrains the sum of coefficients on lagged price

change to be unity, so the dependent variable is in the form of real wage
growth adjusted for the estimated productivity trend.

In the first unrestricted version of the wage equation, presented as the
first line of each pair, some of the coefficients on lagged inflation are below

unity and some are above. If "excess real wage growth" occurs but no dummies
are included, then the excess growth in the nominal wage rate relative to price

change is likely to be picked up by a coefficient of greater than unity on the

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 31
price change variable. This occurs in the U. S., France, Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, and the European aggregate.

The coefficients on the output ratio are generally positive and highly
significant, supporting the Phillips curve hypothesis of a relation between the
charige in the wage rate and the level of a cyclical variable. Note that, because

the current and one lagged output ratio term are included, the specification
could reveal either a "level effect" (a positive sum of coefficients) or a "rate of
change effect" (a positive current coefficient followed by an equal and negative
lagged coefficient, with a zero sum of coefficients). The sum of coefficients on

the output ratio is insignificant in both versions of the wage equation only in
Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland. For all countries, however,

the coefficient has the expected positive sign.

An important finding is that the slope of the Phillips curve for the U. S. is
very similar to that for the European aggregate. The countries with the most
flexible wages in response to business—cycle fluctuations in output (when one

examines the average output ratio coefficient in the two lines of Table 7) are
France, Italy, the U. K., Belgium, and Denmark. The theme in the literature

supporting a greater degree of wage rigidity in the U. S. than in Europe or

Japan is not supported here. The output response of wage rates is actually
greater in the U. S. than in either Japan or Germany.
The wage equations also include the change in the real import price and in

the total tax rate. The import price terms have the correct positive sign more
often than not but are generally insignificant, except in Austria and the
European aggregate. The tax terms often have the incorrect (negative) sign,
with no significant positive coefficients. There are significant negative

P/age and Output Gaps, Page 32
coefficients in France and in the restricted version for Belgium. Thus these
results deny the existence of a significant "tax push" effect that is responsible

for driving up real wage rates and in this sense conflict with the hypothesis
advanced by Tullio (1987) and with results of Knoester and van der Windt (1985).

Column (8) of Table 7 displays the coefficients on the wage push, controls,
and "incomes policy" dummy variables. Where blanks are shown, no such

dummies are defined. Two dummies are defined for France and the U. K., as

indicated in the footnotes to Table 7. The dummies are significant and have the
correct sign for Japan, France (except first dummy in the restricted equation),
Germany, and Europe. Only the second U. K. ("social contract") dummy is

significant, and then only in the unrestricted version. To interpret these
coefficients, they imply as an example in 1973—74 wage rates in Japan increased

14 percent more per lear than can be explained by the other variables. The
U. S. wage controls dummy variables have the right sign and magnintude

suggested by previous research but are not significant.
The second line of each pair of results displays a version of the wage
equation in which the sum of coefficients on lagged inflation is constrained to

be unity, and the "excess real wage growth" dummy variables are included (see
columns (5), (6), and (7)).13 These coefficients are almost all insignificant,
except for a large positive coefficient for 1964—84 in Austria and Belgium, and a

large negative coefficient in Belgium for 1979—84. These results suggest that

there is no statistical evidence to support any generalization that European real
wage increases were excessive over the post—1972 period when unemployment

increased, except for the isolated wage—push episodes isolated in column (8),

most of which refer to the pre—1972 period. Also important for the

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 33
interpretation of the European unemployment problem is the absence of a
significantly positive coefficient for I 980—84, as would be required to confirm the

hypothesis that high unemployment in Europe did not hold down wage changes as
much as would have been predicted from pre—1980 behavior. The interpretation
of the 1980—84 period receives more attention in our discussion of the
'thysteresi&' hypothesis below.

AggeationTesth:IsEuropeOneooury?
Throughout its history, Europe has been plagued by national boundaries.
The Common Market and the EMS have made important progress in knocking

down national boundaries in the economic, if not the political, sphere. Table 8
suggests that national boundaries within Europe also play little role in one
specific area of economics, the dynamics of wage behavior.

Each aggregation test consists of a comparison of the fit of separate wage
equations (corresponding to the unrestricted wage equations displayed as the first
line for each country in Table 7) for a pair of countries with a pooled wage
equation containing all of the same observations for each country but forcing all
coefficients in each country (except on country—specific wage—push variables) to

be the same.'4 Each aggregation test results in a F—test which indicates

whether there is any significant deterioration in fit when two countries are
pooled.

24 lines are displayed in Table 8, the first 23 for various combinations of

European countries and the 24th for a comparison of Europe and the U. S. For
every combination within Europe, there is no significant deterioration in fit when

two countries or groups of countries are pooled. We start by grouping the small
European countries, Austria plus Switzerland ("ASs'), Denmark plus Norway

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 34

("DN"),

and Belgium plus the Netherlands ("BN"). Further groupings in lines 4

through 6 suggest that all seven countries can be aggregated into one country
called "Small". Lines 7 through 9 achieve a grouping of the four large countries
called "Large", and line 10 indicates that the two pseudo—nations "Small" and

"Large" may be grouped together into "Europe."
Several alternative schemes for aggregating the countires are presented in

the bottom section of the table. Lines 11 and 12 indicate that the four low—
unemployment small countries (Austria, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland) may be

successfully aggregated into a country called "Low", and line 13 suggests that
the three high—unemployment countries (Belgium, Denmark, and the Netherlands)

may be aggregated into a country called "High." Further, "Low" and "High" may
be aggregated together.
Alternative combinations of the large countries are presented in lines 15—
19. Together with the combinations on line 7, all possible permutations of the

four large countries pass the aggregation test. Similarly, the group of smal.l
countries can be aggregated with any one of the four large countries, as shown
on lines 20—23, or with the group of large countries, as shown on line 10. Of

all these tests, only that for France plus Germany (line 7)

and

for Italy plus the

U. K. (line 19) come close to failing the aggregation test at the five percent
significance level.

While these tests "knock down" national boundaries within Europe, they do

not manage to span the Atlantic Ocean, for the final aggregation test of Western

Europe and the U. S. fails at almost the one percent level. This occurs, despite
the apparent similarity of the U. S. and Europe equations in Table 7, because of
the higher import price coefficient for Europe and, more important, because of a

Wage and Output Qaps, Page 35
different pattern of lag coefficients on inflation and the output ratio.

An unusual feature of this paper is the use of detrended output (the "log
output ratio") as the only measure of demand pressure on wage and price
changes. How would the wage equations be affected if the log output ratio were

replaced by the unemployment rate? Since the definition of the output ratio
involves defining the amount of demand pressure in a benchmark year as equal

to zero, the specification of the wage equation requires excluding a constant
term. The dummy variables in columns (5)—(7) of Table 7 test the explicit

hypothesis that, relative to the output ratio, real wages increased faster during
specified periods than is justified by productivity growth. However, when the
unemployment rate replaces the log output ratio, the value of the unemployment

rate is positive rather than zero in a benchmark year, requiring that a constant
term be included.

Table 9 exhibits four columns of results for the wage equations of Table 7,

estimated alternatively with the current and lagged value of the log output ratio
and of the unemployment rate. For each version Table 9 displays the sum of
coefficients on the demand variable, the significance level of the sum of

coefficients, the significance level on a test that excludes the demand variable

entirely from the equation, and the standard error of estimate of the overall
wage equation. The specification of the wage equation used for these tests
includes the three constants of Table 7, columns (5)—(7), but omits the restriction

that the sum of the lagged price terms equals unity. The inclusion of three
constants allows the natural unemployment rate to increase over time and thus

satisfies the previously stated objection to the use of the "raw" unemployment

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 36
rate as a measure of demand pressure. As shown in Table 9, for several
countries the standard error of estimate of the wage equation is lower (i.e.,
better) with the unemployment variable than the log output ratio variable
(Canada, France, Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the
European aggregate).

Interestingly, this test again reveals a difference between the large and

degree of significance for either demand variable than do the smaller countries,
where none of the significance levels in columns (3) and (7) falls below (i.e., is

better than) the 0.05 level. The very strong significance of both the output
ratio and unemployment variables for the European aggregate suggests that the
insignificance of either demand variable for the small European countries may

reflect noi8y data. Perhaps the most important result is that for the European
aggregate, the coefficients and significance levels of both the output ratio and
unemployment rate are basically identical to the equivalent figures for the U. S.

To complete the estimation of the wage—price model, Table 10 reports

estimates of the price mark—up equation in the form (8) above. To review, the

mark—up equation is specified in first difference form. The inflation rate is

regressed on the change in trend unit labor cost (current and one lag), the
output ratio (current and one lag), the current rate of change of relative import
prices, the two—year change in the total tax rate, and the single dummy variable

for wage push or controls. To validate the theoretical specification for the
price equation in levels of a procyclically sensitive mark-up in levels, in an

equation for the first difference of prices as in Table 10 the output ratio should

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 37
enter as a first difference, that is, the coefficient on the current output ratio
should be positive and on the lagged output ratio should be equal in absolute
value and negative in sign.

The results appear to contradict the hypothesis of a procyclical price markup. Of the 14 lines in Table 10, seven indicate a significantly negitive sum of
coefficients on the output ratio (plus an eighth, the European aggregate),
indicating a perverse Phillips curve phenomenon that offsets part of the positive

Phillips curve effect in the wage change equations. This result can be explained
by some combination of measurement error and a substantive explanation. The

measurement error, emphasized in part II above (p. 10), arises from the use of a
wage index (compensation per hour) which reflects not just changes in wage

rates but also the procyclical effects of overtime pay and of the changing mix of
employment toward higher wage industries in boom times. If the measurement

error is all that is involved, then the cyclical responsiveness of wages is
overstated in Table 7 and of price markups is understated in Table 10. Only the
reduced—form equations in Table 11 provide an accurate indication of cyclical

responses.

The substantive explanation suggests that in an open economy in which
competition from abroad limits the short—run flexibility of prices, a demand

expansion that raises the output ratio and the rate of wage change is reflected
only partly in price change, resulting in a positive growth rate of the reaL wage.
Such a result implies procyclical rather than countercyclical real wage behavior,

but refers to the rate of change of the real wage rather than its level. Seven
sums of coefficients in column (2) of Table 10 are insignificantly different from

zero, and in no case does this reflect any significant zig—zag from a positive to

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 38
a negative coefficient, as would be implied by a rate-of—change effect of the

business cycle on the change in the mark-up.
The other coefficients in Table 10 imply that the elasticity of price change

to the change in trend unit labor cost is close to unity within the current and
subsequent year. Import price changes are insignificant and/or have the wrong
sign, except in Belgium. A positive and significant tax push effect occurs only
for Japan and Belgium. Finally, the wage—push and controls dummies are

uniformly insignificant, indicating that for Japan and Europe the wage-push
episodes raised wages but did not squeeze profits, leaving the mark—up
unaffected.

Together the wage and price mark—up equations imply the reduced—form

equation for price change written above as (9). This relates the current
inflation rate to two lags of the inflation rate, the current and lagged output
ratio, the current change in the import price, the two-year change in the tax
rate, and the same wage—push and control dummies discussed before. Table ii

presents the results of estimating (9).
The reduced—form equation is critical for determining its natural rate of
unemployment, as well as the overall nominal flexibility of an economy. Upward

"wage—push" pressure working through positive coefficients on the Dt or Dt
dummy

variables in the wage equation do not create inflation or imply an

increase in the natural rate if the equivalent coefficients on Dt or D't are
negative in the price mark—up equation. What matters are the net coefficients in

the reduced—form equation. We return to the issue of the natural rate of
unemployment below.

P/age and Output Gaps, Page 39

The reduced—form also is the final arbiter of nominal flexibility, since

flexibility in the form of a high positive coefficient on the output ratio in the
wage change equation means little if it is offset by a high negative coefficient
on the output ratio in the price mark—up equation. Column (2) of Table 11

indicates that there are significant Phillips curve effects of the level of the
output ratio in the reduced—form inflation equation (for the either the first or
second line of each pair) in eight of the 14 countries, PIUS the European

aggregate. The only countries exhibiting wrongly-signed negative coefficients in
either equation are Austria and Belgium. Comparing the U. S. with Japan and

the European aggregate, the sum of coefficients in the U. S. is lower than in

Japan and Europe for the unrestricted version, while both the U. S. and Japan
have lower sums of coefficients than Europe in the restricted version. Thus
these results support the view that inflation is more responsive to demand

shocks in Europe than in the U. S., but provide only mixed support to the
common view that inflation is more responsive to demand shocks in Japan than

in the U. S.

In light of current policy debates, it is interesting that the

results provide j92LvJewjiofljsrnoreresjyeto
The other coefficients displayed in Table 11 can be compared with the

parallel coefficients in Table 7 for the wage change equations. The coefficients

on the relative import price change term are significantly positive only for the
U. S., Belgium, and the European aggregate. The insignificance of the import
price coefficients for Japan may reflect the much—discussed absence of
manufactured imports.

The estimated controls coefficients in column (8) for the U. S. aggregate

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 40
economy are similar to those in my recent paper (1985) on the behavior of the

U. S. inflation rate in quarterly data, but in the present annual data are not
significant. For Japan the 1973-74 wage-push phenomenon was mostly but not

entirely reflected in faster inflation, leaving the rest to be absorbed by a profit
squeeze. In Europe the only significant wage-push coefficient in Table 11 is in

the unrestricted equation for Germany, suggesting that in the other countries the
significant wage push effects caused a profit squeeze and did not cause faster
inflation (when wages are solved out as in Table 11).
I V.

The

"HYSTERESIS" AND THE NATURAL RATE OF UNEMPLO YMENT

last set of regression results in the paper test the "hysteresis" hypo-

thesis, which states that the natural rate of unemployment is "path dependent,"
that is, is not independent of the evolution of the actual unemployment rate but

rather responds with a lag to the path of the actual unemployment rate. In this
paper, which focusses on the equivalent concepts of the natural level of output

and the log output ratio, the hysteresis hypothesis states that the natural level
of output evolves not along a log—linear trend but with a lagged response to the

actual path of output. If valid, this hypothesis would have the important policy
implication that the output slump in Europe in the 1980s has reduced the natural

level of output, gradually eliminating slack to the point that there is no longer
any further downward pressure on wage changes.
Our test of the hysteresis approach can be illustrated in a simplified
version of the wage equation included here for expository purposes only:

where

once again upper—case letters designate logs of levels, and both the

current and one lagged value of the output ratio are included in the wage
equation to accord with our basic specification reported in Table 7. The second

line of (10) restates the role of the output ratio as entering through the current
difference (A) and the lagged level.

Let us assume that the unobservable natural output level (Q*t) is some
unknown weighted average of the linear trends of Table 4 (QTt) and a hysteresis
term (Q11t) equal to a four—year moving average of actual output:

(1—P)Qt.

To identify the 4' parameter, we substitute (ii) into the

(ccil+c12)4'(Q11t_i — QTt_i)

The hysteresis coefficients (4') listed in columns (1) and (3) of Table 12 are
obtained by running the wage change equations from Table 7 and the reduced—

form price change equations from Table 11 again with the addition of the lagged
(QHt — QTt)

term. The term QHt is defined as a trend-adjusted four—year

moving average:

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 42
+ (1+3qTt_3)Qt_3]/4,

where a lower—case q refers to the growth rate of the output trend for the year
in question. The most important finding in Table 12 is that the hysteresis
coefficients are insignificant at the five—percent level in the wage change

equation in column (1), except for Austria, Belgium, and Switzerland, and in the
reduced—form price change equation in column (3), except in Austria, Belgium,

Sweden, and Switzerland. The fact that the hysteresis hypothesis is validated
only for small European countries having both high unemployment (Belgium) and
low unemployment (Austria, Sweden, Switzerland) seems to remove much of the

"credibility" of the hysteresis hypothesis as an explanation of high European
unemployment, particularly in the four large countries.

Another less formal test of the hysteresis hypothesis is implied by the
dummy variables (Dt) in the reduced—form price equation. If the constant term
for the 1980—84 period is significantly positive, this means that the existing

trend—based measure of the log output ratio predicts too little inflation during

that interval, and that the "true" output gap is smaller. The statistical
significance of such a shift effect cannot be read from the coefficients reported
in Table 11, since all three Dt terms cover the 1980—84. Instead, the identical

equation was rerun with an alternative set of four dummy shift terms covering,
respectively, 1963—69, 1970—74, 1975—79, and 1980—84.

The coefficients and t—ratios on these 1980—84 dummy shift variables are

shown for each country in columns (5) and (6) of Table 12. Positive coefficients
are significant at the 5—percent level only for Canada, Norway, and Sweden, and

for no other country even at the 10—percent level. Only for Sweden do the two

tests of hysteresis concur. We conclude that evidence supporting the hysteresis

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 43

hypothesis

is exceedingly weak, and that our trend-based output ratio series

provides the most reliable basis on which to base an estimate of the natural rate
of unemployment.

The estimates of hysteresis effects in Table 12 should be viewed as testing

a very special and limited version of the hysteresis hypothesis. A hysteresis
coefficient equal to or close to unity means that wage and price behavior is best
explained by assuming that natural output follows actual output with a short lag

(i.e., the output gap disappears when actual output grows at its trend rate,
regardless at how low or high a level). However, a hysteresis coefficient equal

to or close to zero 9_jj_çonstantriaturaIunernp1ojrnentrate.
Instead, the null hypothesis of no hysteresis effect assumes that natural output
grows after 1979 at its 1972—79 rate. Since the actual unemployment rate rose

from 1972 to 1979, the null hypothesis of rio hysteresis allows the natural
unemployment rate to increase from 1972 to 1979 and, for most countries, from
1979 to 1984 as well.

Any output gap estimate for 1984 (or any other year) can be translated into
an implied natural rate of unemployment by using Okun's Law, which states that

there is a regular relationship between the log output gap (Qt - Qt) and the
unemployment gap (Ut — U*t), where Ut and UZi are the usual percentage rates,

not logs:
(14)

Ut

The first summation indicates that the level of the natural unemployment rate

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 44
(U*t) associated in a given time interval with the natural output level (that is, a
situation in which Qt

Q*j)

is estimated by the value of one of four constants

(ii) applying to the intervals 1963—69, 1970—74, 1975—79, and 1980—84. The second

summation allows deviations of the actual unemployment rate from the natural

unemployment rate to be explained by the current and two lagged values of the

log output ratio. The natural unemployment rate corresponding to a given value
of Q*t (whether estimated by the trend or "hysteresIs" moving—average method)

can be calculated from (14) as:
(15)

Ut

Ti,.

Table 1.3 compares the actual 1984 unemployment rate with the two

alternative definitions of the natural unemployment rate. The first, labelled
"trend output," assumes that natural output grows from 1979 to 1984 at its 1972—

79 trend. The second, "hysteresis output," assumes that natural output is a
trend-adjusted four-year moving average of actual output. The 1984 output gap
is translated into an unemployment gap by running the regression in (14) above
and then by using (15) to calculate the natural unemployment rate (Wi).
The most important conclusion in Table 13 is that the trend unemployment

gaps are relatively large in France, Germany, and the U. K. Combined with the
low statistical significance of the hysteresis coefficient in Table 12 for these

countries, this result suggests that there is substantial room for policymakers to
stimulate aggregate demand without causing an accelerating inflation. The
marginal significance of the U. K. hysteresis term in the reduced—form price

equation suggests that some weight should be given to the Ut estimate based on
hysteresis output (12.7 percent), which indicates virtually no slack, and no room

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 45
for demand expansion.

Another interesting result is that for all the seven small European
countries, with the exception of Denmark, the trend and hysteresis versions of
the unemployment gap are close to zero. Thus the low unemployment countries
(Austria, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland> have low natural unemployment rates

by either the trend or hysteresis definition, and the high unemployment countries
(particularly Belgium and the Netherlands) have high natural unemployment, rates

by either definition. For the small countries, then, not only are the hysteresis
oefficients of Table 12 strongly significant for several countries, but the

hysteresis hypothesis is supported in the broader sense that the
to be.
Wage Gps With ZeroOutputGapa

An important conclusion of this paper is that wage gaps in Europe have

declined substantially since 1978 and are no greater than in the U. S. Some
readers may react, "yes, but the wage gaps are low only because unemployment
is high and has held down wages; with lower unemployment the problem of

excessive real wages would return." jyiijpJ lj_

that the actual

Its quantitative significance can be
assessed by using the wage change equations of Table 7 (second line of each

pair) to calculate counterfactual rates of wage change on the assumption that

the trend—based output gap was zero in every year from 1980 to l984 The
difference between wage changes calculated with the actual output gap and with

the counterfactual zero output gap can be cumulated and converted into a

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 46
counterfactual wage gap, as in Table 14.

For every country but Switzerland, the counterfactual wage gap is

substantially higher than the actual wage gap in 1984. For Europe as a whole,

the wage gap is raised from 0.94 to 1.06. The difference is greatest for Italy,
amounting to 28 percentage points. However, the calculation does not serve to
reveal a "real wage problem" in Europe as contrasted with the United States.
The counterfactual 1984 wage gap in the U. S. of 1.10 is actually higher than

the figure of 1.06 for Europe. Further, within Europe there is little relation
between the counterfactual wage gaps and 1984 unemployment rates. Low—
unemployment Austria's counterfactual wage gap of 1.15 contrasts with high—
unemployment Netherland's counterfactual wage gap of 0.81.
IV. CONCLUSION

This paper provides no explanation of high European unemployment.

Instead, its results throw cold water on explanations in the previous literature
based on high real wages in Europe, or on alleged differences in cyclical

productivity, wage and price adjustment between Europe arid the U. S. This dose
of cold water comes in seven containers:
(1) There is no evidence of countercyclical productivity movements in

Europe, except in the U. K. Actual productivity would temporarily increase

faster than the underlying trend rate, rather than increasing slower than
trend, in response to a demand expansion.
(2) After adjustment for the income of the seIf--employed, there is flO
evidence of excessive real wages in Europe. "Wage gap" indexes on a 1972

base computed with either actual productivity or estimated trend

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 47
productivity were almost identical in Europe to the values for the U. S. in
1963 and 1984. The slight bulge in the European wage gap that occurred
between 1974 and 1978 amounts to only about five percentage points over
the U. S. values.
(3) There was indeed a real wage explosion between 1966 and 1975 in
three small high—unemployment countries (Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands).

But the wage gap barely moved in the four large high-unemployment
countries (France, Germany, Italy, U. K.), and in fact increased
substantially less than in low—unemployment Austria. Thus the wage gap

concept is almost useless in providing an explanation of differences in
unemployment experience within Europe.

(4) Further skepticism regarding the relevance of wage and price
adjustment for the European unemployment problem is provided by

aggregation tests. Tests for pooling of wage change equations across
national boundaries in Europe are accepted universally. There are no
significant differences in wage behavior within Europe, except for country—

specific instances of wage push or incomes policies. Of 24 aggregation

tests that are run and reported in Table 8, there is one single failure: the
U. S. wage equation cannot be aggregated with the pooled Western

European equation. This result supports the view that the Atlantic Ocean
is a valid boundary for comparative macroeconomic analysis while national

borders within Europe are not, at least for dynamic wage behavior.
(5) While the U. S. and European wage equations cannot be
aggregated, most coefficients in the European wage equation are quite close

to their counterparts in the U. S. wage equation. In particular, there is no

Wage and Output Qaps, Page 48
support for the proposition that the U. S. is characterized by nominal wage
rigidity and Europe by real wage rigidity. The degree of nominal wage

flexibility in Europe is about the same as in the U. S., and far from being
too rigid, real wages in Europe were too flexible, jumping at the time of
autonomous wage push episodes in the late 1960s in France, Germany, and
Italy.

(6> Just as the paper does not explain high unemployment in Europe,
it does not deny that the natural unemployment rate compatible with a
constant inflation rate has increased substantially since 1972 in every

European country. However, output gaps in Europe are not zero. The
econometric estimates imply that the unemployment rate could be pushed

down by three percentage points, particularly in France and Germany,
without causing an acceleration of inflation (holding constant real import

prices). With falling real import prices in Europe, as has occurred and will

continue to occur with a falling U. S. dollar, there is even less reason to
be concerned that an inflationary spiral would follow a stimulus to
aggregate demand.

(7) Some might argue that wage gaps in Europe in the 1980s have
been pushed down by high unemployment and would bounce back if

unemployment fell substantially. Indeed, we show that for Europe as a
whole the wage gap index would be 12 percentage points higher if output
had continued to grow at its 1972—79 trend rate. However, the claim that
wage gaps have been held down by high unemployment and low output in

the 1980s amounts to an acceptance of one of the major conclusions of this

paper, as emphasized in the previous paragraph: Europe has experienced a

Wage and

Output Gaps, Page 49

substantial Keynesian output gap in the 1980s, and not all of the increase
in European unemployment is "structural" or "classical" in nature.

FOOTNOTES

1. All studies using the LSE Center for Labour Economics data bank,
including Newell--Symons (1985), Grubb (1986), and Bean—Layard—Nickell (1986),

are guilty of mixing manufacturing wage data with data on aggregate employment
or unemployment. That data bank contains no data at all on wages for the
aggregate economy, only for the manufacturing sector.

2. The 14 countries are (in the order listed in Table I below)

U. S., Canada, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, the U. K., Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. Countries included in
the L.S.E. Centre for Labour Economics data bank, but excluded here, are Australia, Finland, Ireland, New Zealand, and Spain.

3. As far as I can tell, only Sachs (1979> makes an explicit adjustment
for self—employment income. Since he does not present estimates of labor's
share with and without the adjustment, it is not clear whether his adjustments
are larger or smaller than mine.

4. The studies that erroneously treat unadulterated unemployment rates
as cyclical variables in wage or productivity equations include Sacha (1983),
Bruno—Sachs (1985), Blanchard—Summers (1986), and Bean—Layard—Nickell (1986).

5. Because of recessions in the U. S. and Canada in 1961, and a dip in
French output in the early 1960s, 1964 is chosen as the benchmark year for
these three countries.
6. The LSE data base, as described by Grubb (1986), contains hourly
earnings only for manufacturing, and not always on a consistent base. Data
for Australia arid Norway are for males only, data for the U. S. include
production workers only, data for Austria, Belgium, Denmark, and Sweden
include mining, data for Belgium includes transport, and data for Spain
include all industries.
7. This unpublished series was provided by John Martin of the OECD. All
other series for the aggregate sector were obtained from an OECD PC data
diskette. rfhe manufacturing data were transcribed manually from printouts
provided by the IMF in May, 1985 and include manufacturing value-added
deflators, output, compensation, employment, and hours for the fourteen
countries identified in footnote 2. The compilation of the manufacturing data
is described in the data appendix of Artus (1984). A critical step in the
development of the data base was the location of data on the absolute value of
each variable (particularly nominal output, nominal compensation, and labor
hours) for the aggregate economy in 1972, in order to allow subtraction of
manufacturing values from aggregate values to obtain the needed residual
values.

Wage and Output Gaps, Page 54
8. As noted above, there is a reference to the issue of self—employment
income in Sachs (1979), but the description is too vague to determine whether
his procedures are comparable to ours. The topic is not addressed in Bruno
(1986).

9. My published comments on Sachs (1983) contain a critique of the
methods used to estimate cyclical productivity effects and productivity
trends.
10. For an alternative formulation that derives a Phillips—curve wage
equation based on the hypothesis that the rate of change of wages is a linear
function of the gap between lagged labor demand and supply, see McCallurn
(1974a, 1974b).

11. For a discussion of alternative methods of imposing structure on wage
and price equations within this context, see Blanchard (1986). In some of his
quarterly wage equations Blanchard imposes the structural assumption that the
coefficient on the current price change in the wage equation cannot be higher
than a specified amount, e.g., 0.3.
12. Exceptions to this procedure are that 1984 is used as a benchmark
year for Japan to take account of highly different growth rates of output during
1979—84 in manufacturing versus nonmanufacturing. Also, since 1961 was a
recession year in North America, the first benchmark is 1964 in Canada and the
U. S., and also in France. The 1961—64 growth rate of natural output for these
countries is assumed to be equal to the observed 1964—72 growth rate.

13. In the wage equation with the constant terms of columns (5)—(7)
excluded, the restriction is accepted by a conventional significance test at
the 5 percent level for all countries but Japan and Denmark. in the reduced—
form equations presented in Table 11, the restriction is accepted for all
countries but Japan.

14. If there are 21 observations for Austria and 21 observations for
Switzerland, then the pooled regression contains 42 observations. However, care
is taken to ritake sure that lagged values for observation 22, Switzerland in 1964,
refer to Switzerland in 1963 and not Austria in 1984! Note that the Dit dummy
variables are not included, since the wage equation used in the aggregation tests
is the unrestricted version from Table 7, while the Dt dummy variables are
meaningful only in the restricted version.
