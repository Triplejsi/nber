ABSTRACT
We analyze the information content of the digital footprint – information that people leave online
simply by accessing or registering on a website – for predicting consumer default. Using more
than 250,000 observations, we show that even simple, easily accessible variables from the digital
footprint equal or exceed the information content of credit bureau scores. Furthermore, the
discriminatory power for unscorable customers is very similar to that of scorable customers. Our
results have potentially wide implications for financial intermediaries’ business models, for
access to credit for the unbanked, and for the behavior of consumers, firms, and regulators in the
digital sphere.

1. Introduction
The growth of the internet leaves a trace of simple, easily accessible information about almost
every individual worldwide – a trace that we label “digital footprint”. Even without writing text about
oneself, uploading financial information, or providing friendship or social network data, the simple act of
accessing or registering on a webpage leaves valuable information. As a simple example, every website can
effortlessly track whether a customer is using an iOS or an Android device; or track whether a customer
comes to the website via a search engine or a click on a paid ad. In this project, we seek to understand
whether the digital footprint helps augment information traditionally considered to be important for default
prediction and whether it can be used for the prediction of consumer payment behavior and defaults.
Understanding the importance of digital footprints for consumer lending is of significant
importance. A key reason for the existence of financial intermediaries is their superior ability to access and
process information relevant for screening and monitoring of borrowers.1 If digital footprints yield
significant information on predicting defaults then FinTechs – with their superior ability to access and
process digital footprints – can threaten the information advantage of financial intermediaries and thereby
challenge financial intermediaries’ business models.2
In this paper, we analyze the importance of simple, easily accessible digital footprint variables for
default prediction using a comprehensive and unique data set covering approximately 250,000 observations
from an E-Commerce company located in Germany. Judging the creditworthiness of its customers is
important because goods are shipped first and paid later. The use of digital footprints in similar settings is
growing around the world.3 Our data set contains a set of ten digital footprint variables: the device type (for

overcoming information asymmetries and Berger, Miller, Petersen, Rajan, and Stein (2005) for empirical evidence.

The digital footprint can also be used by financial intermediaries themselves, but to the extent that it proxies for
current relationship-specific information it reduces the gap between traditional banks and those firms more prone to
technology innovation.
3
In China, Alibaba’s Sesame Credit uses social credit scores from AntFinancial and goods are also shipped first and
paid later (see https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21710292-chinas-consumer-credit-ratingculture-evolving-fastand-unconventionally-just). Other FinTechs that have publicly announced using digital
footprints for lending decisions include ZestFinance and Earnest in the U.S., Kreditech in various emerging markets,
and Rapid Finance, CreditEase, and Yongqianbao in China (see https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/19/technology/

example, tablet or mobile), the operating system (for example, iOS or Android), the channel through which
a customer comes to the website (for example, search engine or price comparison site), a do not track
dummy equal to one if a customer uses settings that do not allow tracking device, operating system and
channel information, the time of day of the purchase (for example, morning, afternoon, evening, or night),
the email service provider (for example, gmail or yahoo), two pieces of information about the email address
chosen by the user (includes first and/or last name and includes a number), a lower case dummy if a user
consistently uses lower case when writing, and a dummy for a typing error when entering the email
address. In addition to these digital footprint variables, our data set also contains a credit score from a
private credit bureau. We are therefore able to assess the discriminatory ability of the digital footprint
variables both separately, vis-à-vis the credit bureau score, and jointly with the credit bureau score.
Our results suggest that even the simple, easily accessible variables from the digital footprint proxy
for income, character and reputation and are highly valuable for default prediction. For example, the
difference in default rates between customers using iOS (Apple) and Android (for example, Samsung) is
equivalent to the difference in default rates between a median credit score and the 80th percentile of the
credit score. Bertrand and Kamenica (2017) document that owning an iOS device is one of the best
predictors for being in the top quartile of the income distribution. Our results are therefore consistent with
the device type being an easily accessible proxy for otherwise hard to collect income data.
Variables that proxy for character and reputation are also significantly related to future payment
behavior. For example, customers coming from a price comparison website are almost half as likely to
default as customers being directed to the website by search engine ads, consistent with marketing research
documenting the importance of personality traits for impulse shopping.4 Belenzon, Chatterji, and Daley
(2017) and Guzman and Stern (2016) have documented an eponymous-entrepreneurs-effect, implying that
whether a firm is named after their founders matters for subsequent performance. Consistent with their
results, customers having their names in the email address are 30% less likely to default.

See for example Rook (1987), Wells, Parboteeah, and Valacich (2011), and Turkyilmaz, Erdem, and Uslu (2015).

We provide a more formal analysis of the discriminatory power of digital footprint variables by
constructing receiver operating characteristics and determining the area under the curve (AUC). The AUC
is a simple and widely used metric for judging the discriminatory power of credit scores (see for example
Stein, 2007; Altman, Sabato, and Wilson, 2010; Iyer, Khwaja, Luttmer, and Shue, 2016; Vallee and Zeng,
2018). The AUC ranges from 50% (purely random prediction) to 100% (perfect prediction) and is closely
related to the Gini coefficient (Gini= 2*AUC–1). The AUC corresponds to the probability of correctly
identifying the good case if faced with one random good and one random bad case (Hanley and McNeil,
1982). Following Iyer, Khwaja, Luttmer, and Shue (2016), an AUC of 60% is generally considered
desirable in information-scarce environments, while AUCs of 70% or greater are the goal in informationrich environments.
The AUC using the credit bureau score alone is 68.3% in our data set, comparable to the 66.6%
AUC using the credit bureau score alone documented in a consumer loan sample of a large German bank
(Berg, Puri, and Rocholl, 2017), as well as the 66.5% AUC using the credit bureau score alone in a loan
sample of 296 German savings banks (Puri, Rocholl, and Steffen, 2017). As a comparison, Iyer, Khwaja,
Luttmer, and Shue (2016) report an AUC of 62.5% in a U.S. peer-to-peer lending data set using a credit
bureau score only. Similarly, in an own analysis we find an AUC of 59.8% using U.S. credit scores from
Lending Club. This suggests that the score provided to us by a German credit bureau clearly possesses
discriminatory power and we use the credit bureau score related AUC of 68.3% as a benchmark for the
digital footprint variables in our analysis.5
Interestingly, a model that uses only the digital footprint variables equals or exceeds the
information content of the credit bureau score: the AUC of the model using digital footprint variables is
69.6%, higher than the AUC of the model using only the credit bureau score (68.3%). This is remarkable
because our data set only contains digital footprint variables that are easily accessible for any firm
conducting business in the digital sphere. Our results are also robust to a large set of robustness tests. In
particular, we show that digital footprint variables are not simply proxies for time or region fixed effects
5

Note that the German credit bureau may use some information which U.S. bureaus are legally prohibited to use
under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Examples include gender, age, current and previous addresses.
4

and results are robust to various default definitions and sample splits. We also provide out-of-sample tests
for all of our results which yield very similar magnitudes. Furthermore, we show that digital footprints
today can forecast future changes in the credit score. This provides indirect evidence that the predictive
power of digital footprints is not limited to short-term loans originated online, but that digital footprints
matter for predicting creditworthiness for more traditional loan products as well.
In the next step, we analyze whether the digital footprint complements or substitutes for
information from the credit bureau. We find that the digital footprint complements rather than substitutes
for credit bureau information. The correlation between a score based on the digital footprint variables and
the credit bureau score is only approximately 10%. As a consequence, the discriminatory power of a model
using both the credit bureau score and the digital footprint variables significantly exceeds the
discriminatory power of models that only use the credit bureau score or only use the digital footprint
variables. This suggests that a lender that uses information from both sources (credit bureau score + digital
footprint) can make superior lending decisions. The AUC of the combined model (credit bureau score +
digital footprint) is 73.6% and therefore 5.3 percentage points higher than that of a model using only the
credit bureau score. This improvement is very similar to the 5.7 percentage points AUC improvement
reported in Iyer, Khwaja, Luttmer, and Shue (2016) who compare the AUC using the Experian credit score
to the AUC in a setting where, in addition to the credit score, lenders have access to a large set of borrower
financial information as well as access to non-standard information (characteristics of the listing text, group
and friend endorsements as well as borrower choice variables such as listing duration and listing category).
It is also sizeable relative to the improvement in the AUC by +8.8 percentage points in a consumer loan
sample of a large German bank (Berg, Puri, and Rocholl, 2017) and the improvement in the AUC by +11.9
percentage points in a loan sample of 296 German savings banks (Puri, Rocholl, and Steffen, 2017), where
the AUC using the credit bureau score is compared to the AUC using the entire bank-internal information
set, including account data, credit history, as well as socio-demographic data and income information.
Taken together, this evidence suggests that a few variables from the digital footprint can (partially)
substitute for variables that are otherwise more expensive to collect, otherwise take significantly more
5

effort to provide and process, or might only be available to a few lenders with specific access to particular
types of information.
Furthermore, digital footprints can facilitate access to credit when credit bureau scores do not exist,
thereby fostering financial inclusion and lowering inequality (Japelli and Pagano, 1993; Djankov, McLiesh,
and Shleifer, 2007; Beck, Demirguc-Kunt, and Honohan, 2009; and Brown, Jappelli and Pagano, 2009).
We therefore analyze customers for whom no credit bureau score is available, i.e., customers whose credit
history is insufficient to calculate a credit bureau score, which we label “unscorable customers”. We find
that the discriminatory power of the digital footprint for unscorable customers matches the discriminatory
power for scorable customers (72.2% versus 69.6% in-sample, 68.8% versus 68.3% out-of-sample). These
results suggest that digital footprints have the potential to boost financial inclusion to parts of the currently
two billion working-age adults worldwide that lack access to services in the formal financial sector.
In the last section, we discuss implications of our findings for the behavior of consumers, firms and
regulators. Consumers might plausibly change their behavior if digital footprints are widely used for
lending decisions (Lucas (1976)). Some of the digital footprint variables are clearly costly to manipulate
(such as buying the newest smart device or signing up for a paid email account) while others require a
customer to change her intrinsic habits (such as impulse shopping or making typing mistakes). However,
more importantly, such a change in behavior can lead to a situation where consumers fear to express their
individual personality online. A wider implication of our findings is therefore that the use of digital
footprints has a considerable impact on everyday life, with consumers constantly considering their digital
footprints which are so far usually left without any further thought. Firms and regulators are equally likely
to react to an increased use of digital footprints. As an example, firms associated with low creditworthiness
products may object to the use of digital footprints and may conceal the digital footprint of their products.
Regulators are likely to watch closely whether digital footprints proxy for variables that are legally
prohibited to be used for credit scoring.
Our paper relates to the literature on the role of financial intermediaries in mitigating information
asymmetries (Diamond, 1984; Petersen and Rajan, 1994, Boot, 1999; Boot and Thakor, 2000; Berger,
6

Miller, Petersen, Rajan, and Stein, 2005). The prior literature has established the importance of credit
history and account data to assess borrower risk (Mester, Nakamura, and Renault, 2007; Norden and
Weber, 2010; Puri, Rocholl, and Steffen, 2017), thereby giving rise to an informational advantage for those
financial intermediaries with access to borrowers’ credit history and account data. More recently, the
literature has explored the usefulness of data beyond the credit bureau score and bank-internal relationshipspecific data for default prediction. These data sources include soft information in peer-to-peer lending
(Iyer, Khwaja, Luttmer, and Shue, 2016), friendships and social networks (Hildebrandt, Rocholl, and Puri,
2017; Lin, Prabhala, and Viswanathan, 2013), text-based analysis of applicants listings (Gao, Lin, and Sias,
2017; Dorfleitner et al., 2016), and signaling and screening via contract terms (reserve interest rates in
Kawai, Onishi, and Uetake 2016; maturity choice in Hertzberg, Liberman, and Paravisini, 2017).
Our paper differs from these papers, in that the information we are looking at is provided simply by
accessing or registering on the website, not by furnishing any information – hard or soft – about the
applicant. We show that even simple, easily accessible variables from the digital footprint provide valuable
information for default prediction that helps to significantly improve traditional credit scores. Our variables
stand out in terms of their ease of collection: almost every firm operating in the digital sphere can
effortlessly track the digital footprint we use. Unlike the papers cited above, the processing and
interpretation of these variables does not require human ingenuity, nor does it require effort on the side of
the applicant (such as uploading financial information or inputting a text description about oneself), nor
does it require the availability of friendship or social network data. Simply accessing or registering on the
website is adequate. Our results imply that barriers to entry in financial intermediation might be lower in a
digital world, and easily accessible digital footprints can (partially) substitute for variables that need to be
collected with considerable effort in a non-digital world. As a consequence, the digital footprint can also
be used to process applications faster than traditional lenders (see Fuster et al. (2018) for an analysis of
process time of FinTech lenders versus traditional lenders). A credit score based on the digital footprint
should therefore serve as a benchmark for other models that use more elaborate sources of information that
might either be more costly to collect or only accessible to a selected group of intermediaries.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an overview about the institutional
setup and data. Section 3 provides empirical results. Section 4 discusses further implications of our
findings. Section 5 concludes.

2. Institutional setup, descriptive statistics, and the digital footprint
2.1 Institutional setup
We access data about 270,399 purchases from an E-commerce company selling furniture in
Germany (similar to “Wayfair” in the U.S.) between October 2015 and December 2016. Before purchasing
an item, a customer needs to register using his or her name, address and email. Judging the creditworthiness
of its customers is important because goods are shipped first and paid later.6 The claims in our data set are
therefore akin to a short-term consumer loan.
The company uses information from two private credit bureaus to decide whether customers have a
sufficient creditworthiness. The first credit bureau provides basic information such as whether the customer
exists and whether the customer is currently or has been recently in bankruptcy. This score is used to
screen out customers with fraudulent data as well as customers with clearly negative information.7 The
second credit bureau score draws upon credit history data from various banks (credit card debt and loans
outstanding, past payment behavior, number of bank accounts and credit cards), sociodemographic data, as
well as payment behavior data sourced from retail sales firms, telecommunication companies, and utilities.
This credit bureau score is requested for purchases exceeding € 100 and we consequently restrict our data
set to purchases for which the company requested a credit bureau score.8 We label those customers for
whom a credit bureau exists “scorable customers”.

6

Customers can choose to pay upfront instead of paying after shipment of the products. Customers paying upfront
are not included in our data set. Paying after shipment, so called “deferred payment”, is by far the dominant payment
type: more than 80% of customers choose to pay after shipment if this method is offered to a customer.
7
The firm switched the credit bureau that provides this basic information in July 2016. Results are very similar preJuly-2016 and post-July-2016.
8
The company requests the credit bureau score if the customer’s shopping cart amount exceeds € 100, even when the
customer ultimately purchases a smaller amount.
8

The E-commerce company uses the credit bureau score together with the digital footprint
(discussed further below) to screen out borrowers with a predicted default rate exceeding 10 percent.
Restricting our data set to orders exceeding € 100 and excluding customers with a very low
creditworthiness has the benefit of making our data set more comparable to a typical credit card, bank loan
or peer-to-peer lending data set.
After the purchase, the items are sent to the customer together with an invoice. The customer has
14 days to pay the invoice. If the customer does not pay on time, three reminders (one per email, two per
email and letter) are sent out. A customer who does not pay after three reminders is in default and the claim
is transferred to a debt collection agency, on average 3.5 months from the order date.

2.2 Descriptive statistics
Our data set comprises 270,399 purchases between October 2015 and December 2016. The credit
bureau score is available for 254,808 observations (94% of the sample) and unavailable for 15,591
observations (6% of the sample). Non-existence is due to customers being unscorable, i.e., not having a
sufficient credit history that would allow the credit bureau to calculate a credit score. In the following and
throughout the entire paper, we distinguish between scorable and unscorable borrowers, i.e. those with and
without a credit bureau score. As shown in Figure 1a, the purchases are distributed roughly even over time
with slight increases in orders during October and November, as typical for the dark season. Table 2
provides descriptive statistics for both subsamples, variable descriptions are in Table 1.
[Table 1 and Table 2, Figure 1a, Figure 1b, Figure 2]
In the sample with credit bureau scores, the average purchase volume is EUR 318 (approximately
USD 350) and the mean customer age is 45.06 years. On average, 0.9% of customers default on their
payment. Our default definition comprises claims that have been transferred to a debt collection agency. 9
The credit bureau score ranges from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). It is highly skewed with 99% of the
9

The average time between the order date and the date a claim is transferred to the debt collection agency is 103
days in our sample, i.e., approximately 3.5 months.
9

observations ranging between 90 and 100. The average credit bureau score is 98.11, the median is 98.86.
Figure 2 provides the distribution of credit bureau scores together with (smoothed) default rates. The
average credit bureau score of 98.11 corresponds to a default rate of approximately 1% and default rates
grow exponentially when credit bureau scores decrease, with a credit bureau of 95 corresponding to a 2%
default rate and a credit bureau of 90 corresponding to a 5% default rate. Note that default rates are not
annualized but constitute default rates over a shorter window of approximately 3.5 months.
Descriptive statistics for the sample without credit bureau score are similar with respect to order
amount and gender, with age being somewhat lower (consistent with the idea that it takes time to build up a
credit history) and default rates being significantly higher (2.5%).

2.3 Representativeness of data set
Our data set is largely representative of the geographic distribution of the German population
overall. As can be seen from Figure 1b, the share of observations in our sample closely follows the
population share for all the 16 German states. Furthermore, the mean customer age is 45.06 years,
comparable both to the mean age of 43.77 in the German population as well as to the mean age of 45.24
reported by Berg, Puri, and Rocholl (2017) in a sample of more than 200,000 consumer loans at a large
German private bank. Our sample is restricted to customers of legal age (18 years and older) and less than
5% of the customers are older than 70. The age distribution in our sample therefore resembles the age
distribution of the German population aged 18-70: the interquartile range of the German population aged
18-70 ranges from 31-56, compared to an interquartile range of 34-54 in our sample.
The average default rate in our sample is 1.0% (0.9% for scorable customers, 2.5% for unscorable
customers). As discussed above, these default rates constitute default rates over a window of approximately
4 months, implying a scaled-up annualized default rate of 3.0%. We compare our default rate to other
studies in Appendix Table A.1. Berg, Puri, and Rocholl (2017) report an average default rate of 2.5% in a
sample of more than 200,000 consumer loans at a large German private bank; the major German credit
bureau reports an average default rate of 2.4% (2015) and 2.2% (2016) in a sample of more than 17 million
10

consumer loans, and the two largest German banks report probability of default estimates of 1.5%
(Deutsche Bank) and 2.0% (Commerzbank) across their entire retail lending portfolio. Default rates
reported by Puri, Rocholl, and Steffen (2017) in a sample of German savings banks are somehow lower.
Taken together, this evidence suggests that default rates in our sample are largely representative of a typical
consumer loan sample in Germany. Charge-off rates on consumer loans in the U.S. across all commercial
banks as reported by the Federal Reserve were approximately 2% in 2015/2016, implying a comparable
default rate to our sample. Default rates reported in some U.S. peer-to-peer lending studies are higher (up to
10% per annum). However, the studies with the highest default rates were conducted using loans originated
in 2007/2008 at the height of the financial crisis. More recent studies report default rates that are
comparable to our default rates on an annualized basis (for example, Hertzberg, Liberman, and Paravisini,
(2016) report a 4.2% annualized default rate in a sample of Lending Club loans originated in 2012/2013).

2.4 Digital footprint
In addition to the credit bureau score described above, the company collects a “digital footprint”
for each customer. All digital footprint variables are simple, easily accessible variables that every firm
operating in the digital sphere can collect at almost no cost. The list of all digital footprint variables is
reported in Table 1.
The digital footprint comprises easily accessible pieces of information known to be a proxy for the
economic status of a person, for instance the device type (desktop, tablet, mobile) and operating system (for
example, Windows, iOS, Android). As documented by Bertrand and Kamenica (2017), owning an iOS
device is one of the best predictors for being in the top quartile of the income distribution. Furthermore, the
distinct features of most commonly used email providers in Germany (for example Gmx, Web, T-Online,
Gmail, Yahoo, or Hotmail) also allow us to infer information about the customer’s economic status. Gmx,
Web, and T-online are common email hosts in Germany which are partly or fully paid. In particular, Tonline is a large internet service provider and is known to serve a more affluent clientele, given that it
offers internet, telephone, and television plans and in-person customer support. A customer obtains a T11

online email address only if she purchased a T-online package. Yahoo and Hotmail, in contrast, are fully
free and mostly outdated services. Thus, based on these simple variables, the digital footprint provides
easily accessible proxies of a person’s economic status absent of private information and hard-to-collect
income data.
Second, the digital footprint provides simple variables known to proxy for character, such as the
channel through which the customer has visited the homepage of the firm. Examples for the channel
include paid clicks (mainly through paid ads on google or by being retargeted by ads on other websites
according to preferences revealed by prior searches), direct (a customer directly entering the URL of the Ecommerce company in her browser), affiliate (customers coming from an affiliate site that links to the Ecommerce company’s webpage such as a price comparison site), and organic (a customer coming via the
non-paid results list of a search engine). Information about a person’s character (such as her self-control) is
also reasonably assumed to be revealed by the time of day at which the customer makes the purchase (for
instance, we find that customers purchasing between noon and 6 pm are approximately half as likely do
default as customers purchasing from midnight to 6am).
Finally, corporate research documents that firms being named after their owners have a superior
performance. This so called eponymous effect is mainly driven via a reputation channel (Belenzon,
Chatterji, and Daley, 2017). We find it reasonable to extend this finding to the choice of email addresses. A
testable prediction from this prior literature is that eponymous customers – those who include their first
and/or last names in their email address – are less likely to default. In contrast to eponymous customers,
those arguably less concerned with including their name but instead include numbers or type errors in their
email address default more frequently.10 The digital footprint provides this type of simple information that
can serve as a proxy for reputation in the form of four dummies, as to whether the last and/or first name is
part of the email address, whether the email address contains a number, whether the email contains an

10

Approximately 10-15% of defaults are identified as fraud cases. Compared to non-fraud defaults, fraud cases have
a higher incidence of numbers in their email address. This is consistent with anecdotal evidence suggesting that
fraudsters create a large number of email addresses and do so in a way that uses a string combined with consecutive
numbers.
12

error, as well as whether the customer types either the name or shipping address using lower case on the
homepage.11
Note that some of the variables discussed above are likely to proxy for several characteristics. For
example, iOS devices are a predictor of economic status (Bertrand and Kamenica, 2017), but might also
proxy for character (for example, status-seeking users might be more likely to buy an iOS device). It is not
our target to point to exactly one single channel that can explain why digital footprints variables can predict
default. Rather we want to highlight existing research that provides guidance as to why we can expect these
variables to matter for default prediction.

3. Empirical results
3.1 Univariate results
We provide univariate results for the sample of customers with a credit bureau score in Table 3.
[Table 3]
As expected, the credit bureau score clearly exhibits discriminatory ability: the default rate in the
lowest credit score quintile is 2.12%, more than twice the average default rate of 0.94% and five times the
default rate in the highest credit score quintile (0.39%).12
Interestingly, the univariate results indicate discriminatory ability for the digital footprint variables
as well. The footprint variables that proxy for income and wealth reveal significant differences in payment
behavior. For example, orders from mobile phones (default rate 2.14%) are three times as likely to default
as orders from desktops (default rate 0.74%) and two-and-a-half times as likely to default as orders from
11

Kreditech is an example of a German company already using simple typography variables, such as the lack of
capital letters, to evaluate credit risk but also detect possible fraud and online impersonations (see BBVA (2017):
The digital footprint: a tool to increase and improve lending, accessed via https://www.bbva.com/en/digital-footprinttool-increase-improve-lending/).
12
Using credit bureau scores for Lending Club loans over the same period we find that the default rate increases only
by a factor of 2.5 from the highest to the lowest credit bureau score quintile, suggesting our credit bureau score has
more discriminatory power in our data set than the credit bureau score in the Lending Club data set, which we will
confirm later using AUCs.
13

tablets (default rate 0.91%). Orders from the Android operating systems (default rate 1.79%) are almost
twice as likely to default as orders from iOS systems (1.07%) – consistent with the idea that consumers
purchasing an iPhone are usually more affluent than consumers purchasing other smartphones. As
expected, customers from a premium internet service (T-online, a service that mainly sells to affluent
customers at higher prices but with better service) are significantly less likely to default (0.51% versus the
unconditional average of 0.94%). Customers from shrinking platforms like Hotmail (an old Microsoft
service) and Yahoo exhibit default rates of 1.45% and 1.96%, almost twice the unconditional average.
Information on character is also significantly related to default rates. Customers arriving on the
homepage through paid ads (either clicking on paid google ads or being retargeted after prior google
searches) exhibit the largest default rate (1.11%). One possible interpretation is that ads, in particular ads
that are shown multiple times on various websites to a customer, seduce customers to buy products they
potentially cannot afford. Customers being targeted via affiliate links, e.g. price comparison sites, and
customers directly entering the URL of the E-commerce company in their browser exhibit lower-thanaverage default rates (0.64% and 0.84%). Finally, customers ordering during the night have a default rate of
1.97%, approximately two times the unconditional average.
There are only few customers who make typing mistakes while inputting their email addresses
(roughly 1% of all orders), but these customers are much more likely to default (5.09% versus the
unconditional mean of 0.94%). Customers with numbers in their email-addresses default more frequently,
which is plausible given that fraud cases also have a higher incidence of numbers in their email address.13
Customers who use only lower case when typing their name and shipping address are more than twice as
likely to default as those writing names and addresses with first capital letters. Interestingly, we find that
eponymous customers who use their first and/or last name in their email address are less likely to default.
Thus information on reputation also shows significant power for predicting default rates. These findings are

13

Approximately 10-15% of defaults are identified as fraud cases. Compared to non-fraud defaults, fraud cases have
a higher incidence of numbers in their email address. This is consistent with anecdotal evidence suggesting that
fraudsters create a large number of email addresses and do so in a way that uses a string combined with consecutive
numbers.
14

consistent with recent findings by Belenzon, Chatterji, and Daley (2017) who show that eponymous firms
perform better, supporting the reputational explanation of their findings.

3.2 Measures of association between variables, Combination of digital footprint variables
In the next step, we report measures of association between the credit bureau score and the digital footprint
variables in order to assess whether the digital footprint variables are correlated with the credit bureau score
and among each other, or whether they provide independent information. As most of the digital footprint
variables are categorical variables, standard measures for ordinal variables (for example, Pearson’s
correlation or Spearman rank correlation) are not feasible. We therefore report Cramér’s V, which provides
a measure of association between categorical variables that is bounded in the interval [0,1], with 0 denoting
no association and 1 denoting perfect association. To allow calculation of Cramér’s V, we transform the
continuous variables (credit bureau score and Check-Out Time) into categories by forming quintiles by
credit bureau score and categorizing the check-out time into morning, afternoon, evening, and night. Table
4 reports the results.
[Table 4]
Interestingly, the Cramér’s V between the credit bureau score and the digital footprint variables is
economically small, with values ranging between 0.01 and 0.07. This suggests that digital footprint
variables act as complements rather than substitutes for credit bureau scores – a claim we will analyze more
formally below in a multivariate regression setup.
The association between the variables Device Type and Operating System is high. This is not
surprising, for example most desktop computers run on Windows and most tablets on iOS or Android. To
avoid multicollinearity, we therefore simply use the most frequent combinations from these two categories
in our multivariate regressions below.14 The check-out time has some association with device

14

The most frequent combinations are Windows and Macintosh for desktop computers, Android and iOS for tablets,
and Android and iOS for mobile phones. See Table A.3 in the Appendix for descriptive statistics.
15

type/operating system. Mobile phones are used relatively more frequently than desktops and tablets for late
night shopping, and desktops are used relatively more in the afternoon. All other combinations of digital
footprint variables have a Cramér’s V of less than 0.25.
The fact that many of the digital footprint variables provide mutually independent information
suggests that a combination of digital footprint variables is significantly more powerful in predicting
default than single variables. We illustrate this idea in Figure 3. Figure 3 depicts default rates using the
variables “Operating system” and “Email host” separately as well as in combination. The sample is
restricted to customers with a credit bureau score.
[Figure 3]
Among the categories from these two variables, T-online users have the lowest default rate
(0.51%), while Yahoo users have the highest default rate (1.96%). As a reference point, we list deciles by
credit bureau score at the bottom of Figure 3. The default rate of T-online users of 0.51% is approximately
equal to the default rate in the 7th decile of credit bureau scores, while the default rate of Yahoo users
(1.96%) is between the 1st and 2nd decile of credit bureau scores. When combining information from both
variables (“Operating system” and “Email host”), default rates are even more dispersed.15 We observe the
lowest default rate for Mac-users with a T-online email address. The default rate for this combination is
0.36%, which is lower than the average default rate in the 1st decile of credit bureau scores. On the other
extreme, Android users with a Yahoo email address have an average default rate of 4.30%, significantly
higher than the 2.69% default rate in the highest decile of credit bureau scores. These results suggest that
even two simple variables from the digital footprint allow categorizing customers into default bins that
match or exceed the variation in default rates from credit bureau score deciles.

3.3 Multivariate results: Digital footprint and default

15

The following results are not driven by small sample sizes, i.e., all categories reported in Figure 3 have at least
1,000 observations.
16

Table 5 provides multivariate regression results of a default dummy on the credit bureau score and
digital footprint variables. We use a logistic regression and report the Area-Under-Curve (AUC) for every
specification. The AUC is a simple and widely used metric for judging the discriminatory power of credit
scores (see for example Stein, 2007; Altman, Sabato, and Wilson, 2010; Iyer, Khwaja, Luttmer, and Shue,
2016). The AUC ranges from 50% (purely random prediction) to 100% (perfect prediction). Following
Iyer, Khwaja, Luttmer, and Shue (2016), an AUC of 60% is generally considered desirable in informationscarce environments, while AUCs of 70% or greater are the goal in information-rich environments. We
also plot the Receiver Operating Characteristic that is used to calculate the AUC in Figure 4.
[Table 5 and Figure 4]
Column (1) of Table 5 reports results using the (continuous) credit bureau score as an independent
variable. As expected and consistent with Figure 2, the credit bureau score is a highly significant predictor
of default, with higher credit bureau scores being associated with lower default rates. The AUC using only
the credit bureau score is 68.3% and is significantly different from chance (AUC of 50%). This result is
comparable to the 66.6% AUC using the credit bureau score alone documented in a consumer loan sample
of a large German bank (Berg, Puri, and Rocholl, 2017) and the 66.5% AUC using the credit bureau score
alone in a loan sample of 296 German savings banks (Puri, Rocholl, and Steffen, 2017). This result is
higher than the AUC of 62.5% reported by Iyer, Khwaja, Luttmer, and Shue (2016) in a U.S. peer-to-peer
lending data set using the Experian credit score only and the AUC of 59.8% we compute for comparison
using credit bureau scores for Lending Club loans. This suggests that the credit score provided to us by a
German credit bureau clearly possesses discriminatory power and we use the AUC of 68.3% as a
benchmark for the digital footprint variables in the following.
Column (2) reports results for the digital footprint, column (3) uses both the credit bureau score
and the digital footprint variables, and column (4) adds age and month and region fixed effects. For
categorical variables, all coefficients need to be interpreted relative to the baseline level. We always choose
the most popular category in a variable as the baseline level. We report AUCs in the bottom rows of Table
17

5 and also test for differences in AUCs using the methodology by DeLong, DeLong, and Clarke-Pearson
(1988).
Interestingly, digital footprint variables have an AUC of 69.6% – which is higher than the AUC of
the credit bureau score.16 These results suggest that even simple, easily accessible variables from the digital
footprint are as useful in predicting defaults as the credit bureau score. We focus on the economic and
statistical significance of the variables in column (2) in the following discussion.
The variables “Email error”, “Mobile/Android”, and the “Night” dummy have the highest
economic significance. The variable “Email error” is a simple dummy variable that is equal to one in only a
few cases, and thus allows categorizing a small portion of customers as being high risk. Customers with an
Email Error have an odds ratio of defaulting which is exp(1.66)=5.25 times higher than customers without
an Email Error. Given that default rates are rather small, default probabilities p and odds ratios (p/(1-p)) are
very similar, implying that customers with an Email Error default approximately 5.25 times more frequent
than customers without Email Error.
Android users default more frequently than the baseline category, consistent with the univariate
results and consistent with the fact that consumer purchasing an iPhones are usually more affluent than
consumers purchasing other smartphones. Customers purchasing at night (midnight-6am) also default more
frequently than customers purchasing at other times of the day, suggesting that purchases made during a
time when many people might be asleep are fundamentally different from daytime purchases.
In column (3) of Table 5, we complement the digital footprint variables with the credit bureau
score. Both the coefficient on the credit bureau score as well as the coefficients on the digital footprint
variables barely change compared to columns (1) and (2). This suggests that the digital footprint variables
complement rather than substitute for the information content of the credit bureau score. As a consequence,
the AUC of the combined model using both the digital footprint variables and the credit bureau score

16

Note that in Table 5 we report only the 6 largest categories for email providers even though we use the largest 18
categories in the regression (all email providers with at least 1000 observations). In a regression using only the 6
reported email hosts, the AUC of the digital footprint decreases by 0.9PP, still being higher than the AUC using
credit bureau score alone.
18

(73.6%) is significantly higher than the AUC of each of the stand-alone models (68.3% for the credit
bureau score and 69.6% for the digital footprint variables).17
In column (4) of Table 5, we add time and region fixed effects and control for age. Results remain
almost unchanged, suggesting that neither the credit bureau score nor the digital footprint act as simple
proxies for different regions, different sub-periods, or different age. While older people are expectedly less
likely to default, consistent with the idea that it takes time to build up a credit history, coefficients for the
credit bureau score and the digital footprint remain very similar.18 Only the coefficient for users of the
premium service T-online, which is known to serve more affluent and older customers, decreases slightly
in economic significance (from -0.35 in column (3) to -0.27 in column (4)).
Figure 5 provides a more detailed look at the correlation between the credit bureau score and the
digital footprint. Using the results from column (2) of Table 5, we construct a default prediction using only
the digital footprint variables for each observation in our sample. For each observation, Figure 5 then
depicts the percentile using the credit bureau score as well as the percentile using the digital footprint score.
As an example, if a customer has a very good credit bureau score (=low default probability) and a very low
default probability by the digital footprint as well, then it would end up in the upper right-hand corner of
Figure 5. A customer with a low credit bureau score (=high default probability) and a very high default
probability by the digital footprint as well would end up in the lower left-hand corner. Observations where
credit bureau score and digital footprint have opposing predictions end up in the upper left-hand corner or
the lower right-hand corner. Figure 4 clearly shows that the correlation between credit bureau score and
digital footprint is very low (R2 of 1.0%, implying a correlation of approximately 10%). These results
confirm our prior observation that the digital footprint acts as a complement, rather than a substitute, of the
credit bureau score.
[Figure 5]

17

Please note that AUCs generated by two independent variables cannot be simply summed up because the AUC of
an uninformative variable is already 50%.
18
The coefficient on log(age) in Column (4) of Table (5) is -0.33 (significant at the 1% level), suggesting that a
doubling in age reduces defaults by approximately one third.
19

3.4 Unscorable customers and access to finance
The lack of access to financial services affects around two billion working-age adults worldwide
and is seen as one of the main drivers of inequality.19 Particularly in developing countries, the inability of
the unbanked population to participate in financial services is often caused by a lack of information
infrastructure, such as credit bureau scores. Many countries have therefore already started leveraging
digital technologies to promote financial inclusion.20 As digital footprint variables are available also for
customers without a credit score, analyzing borrowers’ digital behavior may present an opportunity to
boost financial inclusion – particularly in developing economies, where a large share of the population does
not have access to banking services and therefore to traditional credit sources.21
We test whether the digital footprint can present an opportunity to facilitate access to finance for
customers who do not have a credit bureau score, which we label unscorable customers in our analysis. The
average default rate of unscorable customers in our sample is 2.49% (see Table 6), thereby clearly
exceeding the default rate for scorable customers of 0.94% (see Table 2). This is not surprising, given that
unscorable customers are customers without credit record where uncertainty about repayment is likely to be
higher. Interestingly, the discriminatory power of the digital footprint – as measured by the AUC – is
broadly similar for unscorable customers than for scorable customers (72.2% versus 69.6%), see Table 7
and Figure 6. Adding time and region fixed effects also does not affect our results (Column (3) of Table 7).
[Table 6, Table 7 and Figure 6]
These results suggest that digital footprints may help to overcome information asymmetries
between lenders and borrowers when standard credit bureau information is not available. We clearly have

The World Bank Group identifies financial inclusion as a key enabler of reducing poverty and boosting prosperity
and promotes new use of data and digital technology as an opportunity for expanding access to financial services.

to be cautious in interpolating these results from a developed country to unscorable customers in emerging
markets. Still, recent activity in the FinTech industry suggests this is an avenue that FinTechs aim to take.
Motivated by a dramatic increase in the availability of digital footprints in developing economies, new
FinTech players have emerged that use digital footprints to challenge traditional banking options and
develop innovative financing solutions.22 These FinTechs have the vision to give billions of unbanked
people access to credit when credit bureaus scores do not exist, thereby fostering financial inclusion and
lowering inequality (see Japelli and Pagano, 1993; Djankov, McLiesh, and Shleifer, 2007; Beck,
Demirguc-Kunt, and Honohan, 2009; and Brown, Jappelli and Pagano, 2009 for the link between
availability of credit scores, access to credit and inequality).

3.5 Out-of-sample tests
Table 5 (scorable customers) and Table 6 (unscorable customers) were estimated in-sample which
may overstate discriminatory power due to overfitting. We therefore provide out-of-sample tests using
Nx2-fold cross validation in Table 8. Nx2-fold cross validation is a common method to evaluate out-ofsample performance of an estimator (see for example Dietterich, 1998 for a general discussion of crossvalidation techniques). We thereby randomly divide the full sample into half samples A and B, estimate a
predictive logistic regression using sample A, and use the coefficients to create predicted values for the
observations in sample B. We then estimate a predictive regression using sample B and use the coefficients
to create predicted values for observations in sample A. Finally, we determine the AUC for the full sample
of observations, using all predicted values estimated out-of-sample. We repeat this procedure N=100 times
and report the mean out-of-sample AUCs in column (2) of Table 8.
Panel 1 of Table 8 reports out-of-sample results for scorable customers. The out-of-sample AUC is
less than 1 PP lower than the in-sample AUC for all specifications apart from the fixed effects regression.
In the fixed effects specification, where we insert granular month and region fixed effects, out-of-sample
AUCs are 2.8 PP lower than in-sample AUCs. This is not surprising given that overfitting is in particular an

22

See e.g. https://hbr.org/2017/01/fintech-companies-could-give-billions-of-people-more-banking-options
21

issue when many explanatory variables are used. AUCs for the fixed effects regressions are of little
relevance for our paper as the fixed effects regressions serve the sole purpose of showing that neither the
credit bureau score nor the digital footprint variables are simple proxies for month or region fixed effects.
Panel 2 of Table 8 reports out-of-sample results for unscorable customers. The out-of-sample AUC
using Nx2-fold cross validation decreases by 3.9 PP for unscorable customers compared to the in-sample
estimate. The sample size for unscorable customers is significantly smaller than for scorable customers so
that a larger gap between out-of-sample and in-sample AUCs is expected. The out-of-sample AUC of the
digital footprint for unscorable customers (68.3%) is, however, still similar to the out-of-sample AUC of
68.8% for scorable customers. Overall, our main conclusion – digital footprints provide a similar predictive
power for unscorable customers than for scorable customers – is clearly confirmed in out-of-sample tests as
well.
[Table 8]

3.6 Alternative default definitions and sample splits
Table 9 provides various robustness tests. Panel A uses alternative default definitions and Panel B
provides results for various sample splits. In all Panels, we report the area under curve (AUC) for the credit
bureau score, for the digital footprint, and for both together.
Panel A uses an alternative default definition, namely default after efforts by the collection agency,
in column (2). The collection agency is able to fully recover approximately 40% of the claims, resulting in
a reduced default rate after the collection agency process. The relative importance of credit bureau score
versus digital footprint is almost unaffected and the AUC increases slightly. This seems intuitive, given that
it is harder to predict customers who don’t pay in the first months, but pay at a later point in time than to
simply predict customers that won’t be able to pay at all. Column (3) of Panel A reports results using the
loss given default as the dependent variable. Compared to the credit bureau score, the digital footprint is
both economically and statistically a better predictor of loss given default. The digital footprint therefore
does not only help to predict default, but also helps to predict recovery rates for defaulted exposures. Panel
22

B reports various sub-sample splits. Results are very similar for small and large orders (split at the median)
as well as for female and male customers.
Overall, the robustness tests suggest that our key results from Table 5 – digital footprints predict
default as well or even better than the credit bureau score, and digital footprint and credit bureau score
being complements rather than substitutes, is robust for different default definitions and various sample
splits. This suggests even simple, easily accessible variables from the digital footprint are important for
default prediction over and above the information content of credit bureau scores.
[Table 9]

3.7 External validity
The evidence presented so far provides evidence of the predictive power of the digital footprint for
short term loans for products purchased online. In Section 2.3 (and Appendix Table A.2) we have shown
that our data set is largely representative to a typical German consumer loan sample in terms of age
distribution, geographic distribution, as well as default rates. Appendix Table A.2 – also discussed in
Section 2.3 – further shows that the credit bureau score has a very similar predictive power in our sample
compared to consumer loan samples both at German savings banks as well as at German private banks.
In this section, we provide further evidence for the external validity of our setting. In particular, we
test whether digital footprints today can forecast future changes in the credit bureau score. If a good digital
footprint today predicts an increase in the credit bureau score in the future, then this is evidence that digital
footprints matter for other loan products as well. We therefore run regressions of the form:

(i.e., predicted values from column (2) of Table 5) and predicted default rates using the credit bureau score
(i.e., predicted values from column (1) of Table 5), and X is a set of control variables. We winsorize both
the dependent and the independent variable in equation (1) at the 1/99 percent level. A limitation of our
23

dataset is that the left-hand side variable is available only for customers that are part of our original dataset
and have returned to the E-Commerce company at least once up to March 2018.23 For each observation in
our original data set from Table 5 we check whether the customer returned to the platform and report the
latest available credit bureau score for each customer. For returning customers, the E-Commerce company
only requests a new credit bureau score if the existing credit bureau score is older than six months,
implying that the difference between t and t+1 in equation (1) is at least 181 days. The average (median)
time between t and t+1 in equation (1) is 450 days (431 days), i.e. a little over one year.24
Figure 7 provides descriptive evidence of the predictive power of the digital footprint for the
subsequent development of credit bureau scores. We split our sample into 10 deciles by credit bureau score
and further split each of the 10 decile into observations where the digital footprint predicts a lower
probability of default than the credit bureau score (grey line in Figure 7) and observations where the digital
footprint predicts a higher probability of default than the credit bureau score (black line in Figure 7). We
then plot the average of the subsequent credit bureau score on the vertical axis for each of these 20 bins (10
deciles x digital footprint better/worse than credit bureau score). Figure 7 shows that the grey line is
consistently above the black line, suggesting that customers with better digital footprints also see a better
development of their credit bureau score in the future.

[Figure 7 and Table 10]
Table 10 provides formal regression results. Column (1) provides results without control variables.
The coefficient on ∆
23

,

is economically and statistically highly significant. The

The data set in Table 5 is limited to the period from October 2015 to December 2016 to allow for a subsequent
observation of default rates and loss given defaults. For changes in credit bureau scores we expand the data set until
March 2018. Please note that while the sample from Table 5 is limited to customers that pass the minimumcreditworthiness condition (see Section 2.1), the subsequent credit bureau score is also available for returning
customers that were denied buying via invoice upon returning due to a very low credit bureau score.
24
It is plausible that changes in credit bureau scores affect customers’ decision to return to the E-Commerce
company, but such a selection does not necessarily invalidate our regression design. For the estimate of β1 in
equation (1) we rely on the assumption that the decision to return to the E-Commerce platform is not related to both
the difference ∆(DFt,CreditScoret) and the subsequent change in credit bureau scores. If, for example, customers
whose creditworthiness using the digital footprint is better than their creditworthiness using the credit bureau score
return only if their credit bureau score has increased, then the coefficient β1 would be downward biased (and vice
versa).
24

coefficient of -74.56 suggests that if the digital footprint default prediction is 1PP higher than the credit
bureau default prediction (for example, the digital footprint predicts a 2% default probability while the
credit bureau score predicts a 1% default probability), then the credit bureau score decreases by 0.75 points
in the future. Given that German credit bureau scores represent 1-year survival probabilities, this suggests
that the credit bureau score adjusts 75% on its way towards the digital footprint. Figure 7 shows some
mean reversion in credit bureau scores, with low credit bureau scores getting better on average and high
credit bureau scores getting worse. To ensure that our results are not purely driven by mean-reversion, we
control for CreditScoret in column (2). As expected, the coefficient decreases but remains both
economically and statistically highly significant at -28.14. Controlling for month and region fixed effects
barely changes the coefficient (column (3) of Table 10). The effect is rather monotone across quintiles by
∆

,

, suggesting that effects are not driven only by particularly negative or particularly

positive digital footprints. Consistent with Figure 7, there is some evidence that the effects are somehow
larger for lower credit bureau scores (see column (5) and (6) of Table 10), but the digital footprint clearly
possesses predictive power for future changes in the credit score for higher credit scores as well.
Taken together, the evidence suggests that digital footprints today forecast subsequent changes in
credit bureau scores. This result provides a window into the traditional banking world. As credit bureau
scores are known to predict default rates for traditional loan products, our results point to the usefulness of
digital footprints for traditional loan products as well.

4. Implications for the behavior of consumers, firms, and regulators

Implications for the behavior of consumers
Our prior results are subject to the Lucas (1976) critique, with customers potentially changing their
online behavior if digital footprints are widely used in lending decisions. Some of the digital footprint
variables are clearly costly to manipulate (such as buying the newest smart device or signing up for a paid
25

email account) while others require a customer to change her intrinsic habits (such as impulse shopping or
making typing mistakes). In the following we lay out two major implications of the Lucas critique: one that
directly affects the use of digital footprints in lending decisions, and another implication that affects the
right to free development and expression of one's personality more generally.
First, in the long-run, the discriminatory power of the digital footprint depends on how easily bad
types can mimic good types. If mimicking good types is costless, an uninformative pooling equilibrium
evolves. A sufficiently high cost for mimicking good types results in a separating equilibrium, possibly
making the digital footprint even more informative than is currently the case (Spence (1973)). Clearly,
other digital footprint variables may evolve in the future that are costly to manipulate or proxy for a
person’s innate character. A particular vibrant example is Pentaquark’s scoring model that rejects loans
from applicants who write a lot about their souls on Facebook, as these people are usually too concerned
about what will happen in thirty years, but not the fine print of today’s life.25
Second, and even more importantly, the repercussions of our findings seem even stronger when
consumers adapt their behavior in a conformable way. A world of conformity, where consumers fear to
express their individual personality and act with a permanent desire to portray a positive image to others is
not the role model of a society that most people think of. This argument becomes even more relevant if
lenders expand the scope of digital footprint variables they use, the more of our devices are connected to
the internet, and the more of our personal communication can be traced online. A wider implication of our
findings is therefore that the use of digital footprints has a considerable impact on everyday life, with
consumers constantly considering their digital footprints which are so far usually left without any further
thought.

Implications for the behavior of firms and regulators
The Lucas critique applies not only to consumer behavior, but firms and regulators are equally
likely to react to an increased use of digital footprints. Firms associated with low creditworthiness products
25

See BBVA (2017): The digital footprint: a tool to increase and improve lending, accessed via
https://www.bbva.com/en/digital-footprint-tool-increase-improve-lending/
26

may object to the use of digital footprints and may conceal the digital footprint of their products.
Commercial services that offer to manage individual’s digital footprints may develop. On the other hand,
firms whose products are pooled with low-quality products (for example high-cost Android phones) may
want to ensure that their digital footprint clearly distinguishes them from lower-reputation products in the
same category. Overall, similar to our discussion on consumer behavior, the reaction by firms can either
increase or decrease the predictive power of the digital footprint.
Regulators are likely to watch the use of digital footprints closely. Regulators worldwide have long
recognized the key role of credit scores for consumers’ access to key financial products. As a consequence,
lending acts worldwide – such as the Equal Credit Opportunities Act in the U.S. – legally prohibit the use
of variables that can lead to an unfair discrimination for specific borrower groups. Prohibited variables
usually include variables such as race, color, gender, national origin, and religion. Lenders using digital
footprints are likely to face scrutiny whether the digital footprint proxies for such information and therefore
violate fair lending acts (see Fuster et al. (2017) on this issue). It is also conceivable that incumbent
financial institutions, threatened by competitors using digital footprints, use their well-established access to
politicians and regulators to lobby for a restriction of the use of digital footprints on these grounds.

5. Conclusion
In this paper, we have analyzed the information content of the digital footprint – a trail of
information that people leave online simply by accessing or registering on a website – for predicting
consumer default. Using more than 250,000 observations, we show that even simple, easily accessible
variables from the digital footprint match or exceed the information content of credit bureau scores.
The correlation between the score based on the digital footprint variables and the credit bureau
score is approximately 10%. As a consequence, the discriminatory power of a model using both the credit
bureau score and the digital footprint variables significantly exceeds models that only use the credit bureau
score or only use the digital footprint variables. This suggests that the digital footprint complements rather
than substitutes for credit bureau information and a lender that uses information from both sources (credit
27

bureau score + digital footprint) can make superior lending decisions compared to lenders that only access
one of the two sources of information.
We also show that the discriminatory power for unscorable customers matches the discriminatory
power for scorable customers. These results suggest that digital footprints can indeed help to overcome
information asymmetries between lenders and borrowers when standard credit bureau information is not
available. Digital footprints thus have the potential to boost access to credit to parts of the currently two
billion working-age adults worldwide that lack access to services in the formal financial sector, thereby
fostering financial inclusion and lowering inequality.
Finally, while consumers might plausibly change their online behavior if digital footprints are
widely used for lending decisions, we show that some of the digital footprint variables are clearly costly to
manipulate, but, more importantly, such a change in behavior can lead to a situation where the use of
digital footprints has a considerable impact on everyday life, with consumers constantly considering their
digital footprints which are so far usually left without any further thought. Firms and regulators are
equally likely to react, with firms managing the digital footprint of their products and regulators
scrutinizing compliance with fair lending acts worldwide.
Overall, our results have potentially wide implications for financial intermediaries’ business
models going forward, for access to credit for the unbanked, and for the behavior of consumers, firms, and
regulators in the digital sphere.

Figure 2: Credit bureau score distribution and default rates
This figure shows the distribution of the credit bureau score and the raw and smoothed default rates as a function of
the credit bureau score. (Default(0/1)) is equal to one if the claim has been transferred to a debt collection agency. The
smoothed default rates have been determined using a logistic regression and a second-order polynomial of the credit
bureau score. The sample period is from October 19, 2015 to December 2016. For variable definitions see Table 1.

32

Figure 3: Default rates by combinations of digital footprint variables
This figure shows default rates for combinations of the variables “Operating System” and “Email Host”. The x-axis
shows default rates, the y-axis illustrates whether the respective dot comes from a single digital footprint variable (for
example, “Android users”) or whether it comes from a combination of digital footprint variables (for example,
“Android + Hotmail”). Default rates for credit bureau score deciles are provided as reference points in the row at the
very bottom. The sample only includes customers with credit bureau scores. The sample period is from October 19,
2015 to December 2016. For variable definitions see Table 1.

Figure 4: AUC (Area Under Curve) for scorable customers for various model specifications
This figure illustrates the discriminatory power of three different model specifications by providing the receiver
operating characteristics curve (ROC-curve) and the area under curve (AUC). The ROC-curves are estimated using a
logit regression of the default dummy on the credit bureau score (light gray), the digital footprint (gray), both credit
bureau score and digital footprint (dark gray). The sample only includes customers with credit bureau scores. The
sample period is from October 19, 2015 to December 2016. For variable definitions see Table 1.

Figure 5: Correlation between Digital Footprint and Credit Bureau Score (scorable customers)
This figure illustrates the correlation between the credit bureau score and the digital footprint. The x-axis shows
percentiles by credit bureau score. The y-axis shows percentiles by the digital footprint. The digital footprint is
estimated using the results from column (2) of Table 5 and multiplied by minus 1 to ensure the same ordering as the
credit bureau score (high value = low default probability). The sample only includes customers with credit bureau
score and is based on a 1% random sample in order to be able to visualize the results. The sample period is from
October 19, 2015 to December 2016. For variable definitions see Table 1.

Table 4: Correlation/Association between credit bureau score and digital footprint variables (scorable customers)
This table provides a measure of association, Cramér’s V, between credit bureau score quintiles and the digital footprint variables. Cramér’s V measures the
association between two categorical variables and is bounded between [0,1], with 0 denoting no association and 1 denoting perfect association. To allow
calculation of Cramér’s V, the credit bureau score has been transformed into categories by forming quintiles of the credit bureau score. Please note that most
digital footprint variables are nominal categorical variables so that Pearson’s correlation coefficient or Spearman’s rank correlation cannot be determined. The
sample is based on scorable customers, i.e. the set of customers for which a credit bureau score is available. The sample period is from October19, 2015 to
December 2016. For variable definitions see Table 1.

Table 5: Default regressions (scorable customers)
We estimate default rate regressions where the dependent variable (Default(0/1)) is equal to one if the claim has been transferred to
a debt collection agency. Column (1) provides results using the credit bureau score as the independent variable, column (2) provides
results using the digital footprint variables as independent variables, column (3) uses both the credit bureau score and the digital
footprint variables as independent variables, and column (4) adds age and month and region fixed effects. All models are estimated
using a logistic regression model. The sample is based on scorable customers, i.e. the set of customers for which a credit bureau
score is available. The sample period is from October 19, 2015 to December 2016. For variable definitions see Table 1.

Table 7: Default regressions (unscorable customers)
This table provides regression results for the same model specifications as in Table 5 using the sample of unscorable
customers. Since this sample only includes customers for whom credit bureau scores are unavailable, the first column from
the initial specification is omitted. We estimate default rate regressions where the dependent variable (Default(0/1)) is equal
to one if the claim has been transferred to a debt collection agency. Column (1) provides results using the digital footprint
variables as independent variables. Column (2) provides a comparison to the results for the sample of scorable customers.
Column (3) adds month and region fixed effects. All models are estimated using a logistic regression model. The sample is
based on unscorable customers, i.e. the set of customers for which a credit bureau score is not available. The sample period is
from October 19, 2015 to December 2016. For variable definitions see Table 1.

We only report coefficients for the 6 largest email providers even though we use the largest 18 categories in the
regression (all email providers with at least 1000 observations). Using only the 6 reported email hosts does not
significantly affect the results.

Table 8: Out-of-sample estimates
This table provides robustness tests out-of-sample for all main regression specifications. Panel 1 reports AUCs for scorable
customers for the model specifications from Table 5, and Panel 2 reports AUCs for unscorable customers for the model
specifications from Table 7. Column (1) reports the baseline results for scorable and unscorable customers. Column (2) reports outof-sample estimates of the AUC using Nx2-fold cross validation. We thereby randomly divide the full sample into half samples A
and B. We then estimate a predictive logistic regression using sample A and use the coefficients to create predicted values for
observations in sample B. We also estimate a predictive regression using sample B and use the coefficients to create predicted
values for observations in sample A. We then determine the AUC for the full sample of observations, using all predicted values
estimated out-of-sample. The AUCs reported in Column (2) are the mean AUCs from 100 iterations. The sample period is from
October 19, 2015 to December 2016.

Table 9: Robustness tests (scorable customers)
This table provides robustness tests using alternative default definitions as well as various sample splits. Panel A provides results
using alternative default definitions. Column (1) reports results using the standard default definition (default = transfer to debt
collection agency), column (2) provides a stricter default definition (default = no full repayment after attempts of debt collection
agency). Column (3) uses only the sample of defaulted loans and uses the loss given default as the dependent variable. In column (3)
we report the R-squared instead of the AUC, as column (3) is estimated using a linear regression model while all other models are
estimated using a logistic regression. Panel B provides results for various sample splits. All models are estimated using a logistic
regression model; apart from column (3) in Panel A, which is estimated using a linear regression model. The sample is based on
scorable customers, i.e. the set of customers for which a credit bureau score is available. The sample period is from October 19,
2015 to December 2016. For variable definitions see Table 1.

Table 10: Predicting changes in credit bureau score with the digital footprint
This table provides a linear regression of changes in credit bureau scores on the difference between the default probability using
the digital footprint and the default probability using the credit bureau score. The independent variable ∆(DigitalFootprintt,
CreditScoret) measures the difference in predicted values of column (2) of Table 5 and the predicted values of column (1) of Table
5. The dependent variable (∆ (CreditScoret+1, CreditScoret)) measures the change in credit bureau score between i) the credit
bureau score as of the date of purchase from Table 5 and ii) the latest available credit bureau score up to March 2018. Two credit
bureau scores at two different dates are only available when customers return to the E-Commerce company at least once between
October 2015 and March 2018. Column (2) adds the initial credit bureau score as a control variable, column (3) adds month and
region fixed effects, column (4) displays results by quintile of ∆(DigitalFootprintt, CreditScoret), and columns (5) and (6) split the
sample at the median credit bureau score. For variable definitions see Table 1.
