ABSTRACT
In this paper, we use a measure of fluid intelligence, an adaptive number series test, to measure
that part of cognition for respondents in two developing countries: China and Indonesia, both with
very low educated elderly populations. This test was specially adapted by us and our collaborators
from measures used in the United States to better fit such populations. We also use a measure of
episodic memory and one measuring mental state intactness and examine their distributions and
then the socio-economic gradients associated with each, concentrating on gender differences and
how those change as SES and variables measuring community development are added.
We find large variation in our cognition measures in both countries, even among those 60 and over
with no schooling. We explore the bivariate socio-economic gradients for these measures,
separately for different age groups: 45-59 and 60 and above. We find strong gender, education
and rural-urban gradients. Of these, the education gradient is the strongest, followed by the ruralurban gradient. China has a stronger rural-urban gradient than Indonesia, which is associated
with the hukou residential permit system in China.
We find a significant, negative multivariate differential for women, that is significantly larger in
China than Indonesia. The gender differential in both countries is smaller for the mid-aged,
45-59, for whom the gender schooling differentials are smaller. The gender differential
declines substantially, and the China-Indonesia differential disappears once we control
for SES characteristics. Adding community measures related to mean schooling and asset
levels does not affect the gender differential.
Schooling levels are monotonically and significantly related to higher levels of cognition for all
three of the variables we use. The magnitudes of the schooling coefficients are relatively large.
Higher log of household per capita expenditure (pce) is positively associated with cognition,
more so in China. Other SES characteristics such as height, are also positively related to the
cognition measures, again more strongly so in China. Rural respondents have substantially lower
levels of cognition measures, with a significantly stronger gradient in China. Mean community
level schooling and log pce are also positively related to cognition outcomes, especially for
elderly women.

Introduction
In this paper, we use a measure of fluid intelligence, an adaptive block number series test, to
measure that part of cognition for respondents in low income, low educated populations. We use
population survey data from China and Indonesia, from the China Health and Retirement
Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) and the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS). The number series test
was specially adapted by us and our collaborators from measures used by the Health and Retirement
Study (HRS) in the United States to better fit such low income populations. We also use a measure
of episodic memory and one measuring mental state intactness and examine their distributions and
the socio-economic gradients associated with each, concentrating on gender differences and how
these change as SES and variables measuring community development are added.
We use the fifth wave of IFLS, fielded in 2014/15, and the third wave of CHARLS, fielded in
2015/16, so this analysis is cross-sectional. The reason is that the main cognition variables we want
to use are only available in wave 5 for IFLS and in wave 3 for CHARLS. IFLS covers all people
within a surveyed household, and our cognition measures (except one) were asked of all respondents
aged 15 and over. CHARLS is a nationally representative aging survey covering respondents aged
45 and over (and their spouses). In this paper we will make inter-country comparisons for
comparably aged respondents, 45 and older and 60 and over.
Indonesia is a low-income country that has been growing economically at relatively high
rates since the mid-1960s. There exists substantial variation within Indonesia, which IFLS well
captures. China has grown from a low-income country to a middle-income country from 1980 until
2015. China’s older population, however, has very little education, similar to Indonesia’s elderly.
In this paper, we first examine the properties of our cognition measures, focusing on whether
there exists variation by age and education groups and by education within age groups. We pay
special attention to the lowest education within the oldest age group to see if there is variation with
that group. This has been a concern of some social scientists in the past and some worry about the

3

number series test in this regard. We find for both IFLS and CHARLS that there does exist plentiful
variation even among older people (aged 60 and above) with no schooling, specifically for the
number series, as well as for the other cognition measures we use. The three measures are positively
correlated, but not perfectly, so they are not measuring the exact same construct.
We explore the socio-economic gradients for these measures, separately for two different age
groups: 45-59 and 60 and above. We find significant, negative differentials for women for all three
cognition measures in both countries, that are lower for the mid-aged group, 45-59. The differentials
are larger in China, significantly so, especially for the elderly age group. The gender differential
declines substantially once we control for SES characteristics in both countries, and the country
differential becomes insignificant. Adding community measures related to mean community
schooling and mean community household per capita expenditure (pce) levels does not affect these
gender differentials.
Schooling levels are monotonically and significantly related to higher levels of cognition for
all three of the variables we use. The magnitudes of the schooling coefficients are relatively large in
both countries. Higher household pce is also positively associated with cognition, more so in China.
Other SES characteristics such as height, are also positively related to the cognition measures, again
more so in China. Cognition measures are substantially lower among rural respondents, more so in
China, the country differential being significant. Mean community levels schooling and household
pce are also positively related to cognition outcomes, especially for elderly women.

Literature Review
Cognition psychologists separate cognition broadly into fluid and crystallized intelligence
(Horn and Cattell, 1966, 1967; McArdle et al., 2002). Crystalized intelligence has to do with
accumulated knowledge from school and from experiences. Fluid intelligence has to do with
abstract reasoning ability. Past research has shown that fluid intelligence tends to peak during

4

adolescence or in young adulthood while crystallized intelligence in mid-age, around 50 (Horn and
Cattell, 1967; McArdle et al., 2002). There are different dimensions of fluid intelligence.
Quantitative reasoning is one, and has to do with reasoning with mathematical concepts. In this
paper, we use a modification of an adaptive block number series test used in the HRS, which shows a
series of numbers with one blank and asks a respondent to fill in the blank with no prompting of
possible correct answers. Smith, McArdle and Willis (2010) have found the number series to be
highly correlated with financial wealth in the HRS data.
Other dimensions of cognition include measures of episodic memory or mental status
intactness. CHARLS and IFLS both use the HRS version of the CERAD immediate and delayed
word recall to measure episodic memory (Ofsteddal et al., 2005). Ten 10 nouns are slowly read to
the respondent who is then asked to recall as many as they can. After approximately 4 minutes of
other questions the respondent is asked again to recall the nouns, without reading out the words a
second time. Mental intactness is measured in HRS, CHARLS and IFLS using a series of questions
from the Telephone Interview of Cognition Status (TICS) (Brandt et al., 1988). This includes
recognition of date: month, day, year, season (CHARLS and IFLS allow using the lunar calendar and
IFLS the Islamic calendar, in addition to Gregorian calendar), day of the week, how the respondent
rates their own memory on an excellent, very good, good, fair, poor scale, and serial subtraction of
7s from 100 (up to five times). The respondent is also asked to redraw a picture of overlapping
pentagons.
Lei et al. (2012, 2014) examine episodic memory and mental intactness using the China
Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) and document a large gender difference, with
women having significantly lower scores. These gender differences are substantially larger for older
women, in part because older women have a substantial disadvantage in schooling completed
relative to older men. Among the youngest cohorts of women examined (who are mid-aged in

5

CHARLS) no gender differences were found. Controlling for education and other socio-economic
(SES) covariates lowered but did not eliminate the gender differences.
However, adding community characteristics related to the level of community development
did eliminate the gender difference for episodic memory, although not for mental intactness. Living
in a more economically developed community is associated with better cognition scores, particularly
for women.

Data
The data for this paper come from the fifth wave of the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS)
(see Strauss, Sikoki and Witoelar, 2016) and the third wave of the China Health and Retirement
Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) (CHARLS, 2017).
The Indonesia Family Life Survey is a continuing longitudinal socioeconomic and health
survey. It is based on a sample of households representing about 83% of the Indonesian population
living in 13 of the nation’s 26 provinces in 1993. The survey collects data on individual respondents,
their families, their households, the communities in which they live, and the health and education
facilities they use. The first wave (IFLS1) was administered in 1993 to individuals living in 7,224
households. IFLS5 was fielded in late 2014 and early 2015 on the same set of IFLS households and
splitoffs: 16,204 households and 50,148 individuals were interviewed. IFLS has had cognition tests
for part of the sample since the third wave in 2000. In IFLS5 new tests were added, plus the age
range for old tests was expanded.
The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) is a nationally
representative survey of China. The CHARLS national baseline survey was conducted in 2011-12. It
includes one person per household aged 45 years of age or older and their spouse (no matter the
spouse’s age), totaling 17,708 individuals, living in 10,257 households in 450 villages/urban
communities (see Zhao et al., 2013). The sample includes 150 counties/districts in 28 of China’s 30

6

provinces excluding Tibet. The sample is a stratified (by per capita GDP of urban districts and rural
counties), multi-stage (county/district-village/community-household) sample, using PPS. In light of
the outdated household listings at the village/community level due to population migration,
CHARLS designed a mapping/listing software (CHARLS-GIS) that makes use of Google-earth map
images to list all dwelling units in all residential buildings to create sampling frames. The third wave
of CHARLS was administered from mid-2015 to early 2016 and covered 12,450 households with
21,057 respondents. As for IFLS, and HRS, CHARLS surveys split-off households, which is why
the increase in sample size.
The major new cognition test added in IFLS5 and the 3rd wave of CHARLS, and the main
subject of this paper, is an adaptive number series test, designed after the test used in the Health and
Retirement Study (HRS) (see Fisher et al., 2013). In IFLS this is given to all respondents aged 15
and higher; in CHARLS to all respondents. The number series test measures a specific form of fluid
intelligence related to quantitative reasoning. It has been found by Smith, McArdle and Willis
(2010) to be highly correlated with the financial wealth of HRS respondents. The test requires a
respondent to look at a series of numbers with one number missing and to fill in the missing number.
The HRS number series is a 6 question block adaptive test (with 15 questions in total that
could be asked). All respondents are asked the same first three questions. Depending on how many
correct they answer they go to a second block of four possible, each having three additional
questions. The difficulty of the second block of questions is increasing with the number of correct
answers for the first block of three questions. Within each block the 3 questions have an increasing
level of difficulty.
We worried that the level of difficulty of the HRS version might be too difficult for countries
with low levels of schooling and income. With the support of the Division of Behavioral and Social
Research of the National Institute on Aging, Strauss, John McArdle (co-PI for cognition of HRS),
Robert Willis (former PI of HRS) and Rebeca Wong (PI of the Mexican Health and Aging Study,

7

MHAS) had a series of discussions that led to efforts to develop and field test a revised version of the
number series test. Under the leadership John McArdle and with the help of Dr. Richard Woodcock,
a revised version of the HRS test was developed, with some of the same questions as HRS, plus
some new questions of lesser difficulty. We pretested this new version extensively in both Indonesia
and Mexico and found that the new version was well-suited to low schooling environments. In
particular, even older respondents with no schooling could generally answer some of the questions
correctly, so we had power to discriminate their fluid intelligence (see Prindle and McArdle, 2013).
This is the version that is used in both IFLS and CHARLS.
The number series answers are scored using a standardized score called a W-score. These are
comparable to the W-scores used in the Woodcock-Johnson III test battery (Jaffe, 2009). The Wscale is a transformation of the difficulty parameters from a Rasche item response model. It is an
interval scale and the differences in scores is supposed to measure the same difference no matter
where on the scale, for example between 400 and 410 and 500 and 510. In the particular test used in
IFLS W-scores range from 299 to 635, with 17 different ordinal scores. The W-scores are
comparable across surveys, even though not all of the questions are the same. So for instance, Wscores from IFLS can be compared to those of CHARLS, but also to those of HRS. This is because
IFLS and CHARLS use some of the same questions as in HRS.
IFLS4 in 2007 introduced a measure of episodic memory as measured by immediate and
delayed word recall, which was repeated in IFLS5. The HRS version of the word recall is used.
CHARLS has used the same HRS version since wave 1. The respondent is told and shown 10
commonly used nouns, then asked to repeat as many as they can remember, both immediately and
after approximately 4 minutes of other questions. In this paper we use the mean number of words
recalled correctly on both immediate and delayed recall.
Finally, we examine a measure of mental status called mental intactness. It is a combination
of nine different questions taken from the Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status (TICS): 3 having

8

to do with date orientation, up to 5 having to do with the ability of the respondent to subtract 7 from
100 5 successive times, and 1 having to do with the respondent being able to draw a figure with 2
overlapping pentagons, while looking at a picture of the drawing done correctly. These questions
were partly introduced in IFLS4 and updated in IFLS5. They have been used in CHARLS since
wave 1. They are also used in HRS. In IFLS some of the mental intactness questions are only given
to respondents aged 50 and older, although in CHARLS all questions are given to everyone. The
CHARLS mental intactness and episodic memory questions have been used in a number of related
papers, including Lei et al. (2012, 2014).
IFLS and CHARLS are very broad-based population panel surveys, containing information
on many dimensions of life. In this paper we look at SES measures and their correlations with these
cognition measures for different age groups. We focus on gender differences controlling for five
year age dummies, district (IFLS) or county (CHARLS) dummies and a dummy for rural area (IFLS
or rural hukou (CHARLS). We then examine how the gender differences are intermediated by levels
of schooling, a linear spline in log of household per capita expenditure (pce), height and marriage
status. For levels of schooling, we include dummy variables for some primary, complete primary,
complete junior high school, and complete senior high school or more, relative to the omitted
category, no schooling. We also add community fixed effects and explore what factors could be
responsible by including community mean levels of schooling levels and log pce and allow them to
interact with the female dummy, similar to the work of Lei et al. (2012; 2014) using CHARLS data.
For the SES regressions we use 2 broad age groups: 45-59 and 60+, for both IFLS and CHARLS.

Cognition test distributions and correlations
Table 1a shows the pattern of answers to the number series questions by all respondents 45
and older in both IFLS and CHARLS. As shown in Table 1b, the 3 entry block questions were all
answered correctly by 17.5% of respondents 45 and older in China and 12.5% in Indonesia (a higher

9

fraction correctly answered all 3 among respondents under 45 years in Indonesia). Comparable
fractions, 16.3% of respondents in China and 14.4% in Indonesia, did not answer any of the first
three questions correctly. In general, within each block the first question, which is the easiest, is
answered correctly by a higher percent than the second or third questions. It is not always the case
that questions in the easier blocks after the opening block that all respondents answer are more
frequently answered correctly than those in harder blocks, because of selection of the respondents
who are answering each block.
Table 1b shows the distributions of W-scores for all age groups combined. We show for the
entry block and for each second block, the number of respondents and the percent that get each
number of correct answers, and the associated W-score. Some 12.9% in China and 8.5% in
Indonesia 45 and older got no correct answers out of 6 possible and only 1.1% and 0.6% in China
and Indonesia respectively got all 6 correct. Getting one correct in the opening block and one correct
in the (easiest) second block is the modal score, 16.7% Chinese and 21.4% Indonesians did that.
Getting two correct in the opening block and none in a harder second block has the next highest
frequency in China, 15.8%, while one correct in the opening block and none in the second is the next
highest in Indonesia, 18.3%. There is a good spread among the rest of the W-score categories.
Figure 1 displays the histograms of W-scores by 2 age groups: 45-59 and 60+, and by
schooling level: no schooling, some primary, completed primary, completed junior high school and
completed senor high school or more. The CHARLS and IFLS scores are plotted over each other.
The W-score distribution shifts left for both distributions with older age and with less schooling.
The W-score distribution is slightly shifted left for the CHARLS compared to the IFLS sample, both
for age and schooling. Likewise the distribution shifts left for each education group for the elderly
(60 and over).
Table 2 shows the distributions for all respondents aged 45 and older and for each schooling
level within this group. For the subset of the elderly with no schooling, the group we may be most

10

worried about, 34.2% in China and 30.6% in Indonesia got nothing correct, which means that 6570% did get at least one correct answer; indeed one can observe there is a distribution of correct
answers among this group. Figure 1 shows the histogram for this group, which shows that there
exists variation in the W-scores.
Figure 2 exhibits the histograms for the word recall, again by age group and education level.
The distributions are close between IFLS and CHARLS. They are somewhat right skewed for the
mid-aged and elderly groups, similar to W-scores. The distributions have a lot of spread in it, even
for elderly with no education, as shown in Table 3. By education, there is a strong skew for the
elderly with no schooling, but the distribution is much more centered for high schooling groups, even
among the elderly.
A very similar set of patterns exists for mental intactness for those 50 and over and 60 and
over, as shown in Figure 3 and Table 4. The CHARLS distribution has somewhat more spread on
both ends than that for IFLS. For both countries, the distributions by age group are centered for
those with no schooling, but become left-skewed at higher levels of schooling. For mental intactness
in Indonesia, a very trivial percent, 2.6%, gets nothing correct among the over 50 and no schooling
group, while for China a much larger fraction, 16.9% got nothing correct.
Table 5 shows the simple correlations in the raw data between the number series, word recall
and mental intactness for 45 and older and the two sub-age groups. The correlations between Wscore and word recall are very close for China and Indonesia, .43 and .41 respectively. Between Wscore and mental intactness (for 50 and over) the correlation is higher in China, .63, compared to .47
in Indonesia. There are small differences in the correlations across the 2 broad age groups, some of
which may be due to correlations with age (and schooling, which in turn is correlated with age). For
both countries, the correlations are slightly higher for the older age group.

Gender and SES gradients of cognition measures

11

We conduct this analysis in two parts. First we examine figures of cognition scores by age;
stratified by gender, by education level and by urban-rural status. We then report regressions,
focusing on the elderly, but run the same regressions for the 45-59 age group, which are reported in
the Appendix. Figures are not weighted, but all regressions are, with cross-section sample weights
that are corrected for non-response (see Zhao et al., 2013 and Strauss et al., 2016, for details on
construction of these weights).
Figures 4-6 show the bivariate patterns of cognition by age for W-scores (Figure 4), word
recall (Figure 5) and mental intactness (Figure 6). Each figure has three panels, showing the
stratifications by gender, education level and rural-urban status. For the W-score, we can see in
Figure 4a, that men score higher than women, and the difference is larger for older respondents.
This is the pattern reported by Lei et al. (2012, 2014) for word recall and mental intactness, which
they demonstrate is due in part to a wider schooling gender gap for older Chinese. The same pattern
is displayed for word recall and mental intactness (remember that the scales differ for the three
cognition measures).
For the W-score and to a lesser extent word recall, the scores tend to be higher for Chinese
than for Indonesians, both men and women, consistent with the density plots. That is reversed for
mental intactness for women, although not for men; the reasons for this are not clear.
The bivariate education gradients are very large, larger than the bivariate gender gaps. These
seem to decline with younger age slightly for the W-scores, but not as much for word recall or
mental intactness. As is true for gender, by education level the W-scores are higher for Chinese than
for Indonesians, except at very old ages for women. This may result from differing mortality
selection patterns between China and Indonesia. For word recall we see a similar pattern except that
the differences within education groups are small compared to the W-scores. For mental intactness
Indonesian women have higher scores across all ages, given their education level, although the
reverse is true for men.

12

Chinese with agricultural hukou have lower cognition scores than those with non-agricultural
hukou for all 3 measures. The difference is large, larger than the gender gap, but not as large as the
education gap. For Indonesia, the rural-urban cognition gaps are considerably smaller than for
China. This is not so surprising because in China the hukou status is mandated and hard for
individuals to change, even when one migrates, whereas in Indonesia there do not exist residential
permit requirements. Also in Indonesia the difference between urban and rural is often very blurred.
We now turn to the regression results. Table 6 presents descriptive statistics (weighted like
the regressions) by gender for the SES variables for elderly group for both CHARLS and IFLS.
Appendix Table 1 presents the same for the mid-aged group, 45-59.
For the elderly group presented in Table 6, mean W-scores are higher for men in China than
in Indonesia (significant at the 1% level), and slightly higher for women (significant at 10%). Mean
word recall scores are roughly the same in both countries for both genders, while for mental
intactness, mean scores are slightly higher for men in China, but for women in Indonesia (both
differences significant at 1%). Among the mid-aged group, W-scores are also higher in CHARLS,
but the differences only significant for men.
Within each broad age group, CHARLS has a slightly older population than IFLS. To
account for this and other age impacts in the regressions we control for 5-year age dummies. They
are jointly significantly different between CHARLS and IFLS.
For the elderly, CHARLS has a larger fraction in the tails compared to IFLS, the education
dummies being jointly significantly different between the countries at 1%. IFLS has a higher
fraction of male respondents than CHARLS who have completed high school or more, 20% versus
10%, while for women the fractions are the same, 10%. However when we aggregate completing
junior high plus senior high school or more, the fractions are a little higher in CHARLS for both men
and women. The fraction of population with no schooling is a higher among the CHARLS elderly

13

than in IFLS, especially for women.1 Some 54% of the elderly women in the CHARLS sample have
no schooling, compared to 35% in IFLS. For men with no schooling the corresponding fractions are
19% for CHARLS and 13% for IFLS. Notice that when we aggregate no schooling with some
primary (which means unfinished primary) the fractions are comparable for women across CHARLS
and IFLS, while for men they are much higher in IFLS (62% versus 67% for women in CHARLS
and IFLS respectively; 29% versus 46% for men).
As shown in Appendix Table 1 for the mid-aged, 45-59, schooling differentials are
considerably narrower between CHARLS and IFLS samples, although they are still jointly
significantly different. While the fraction with no schooling remains larger for women in CHARLS,
28% compared to 14%, for men they are roughly the same, at 8% and 9%. Aggregating no schooling
with some primary, the fractions for men are larger in IFLS, as is true for the elderly. For women,
the aggregate with low education is still now considerably larger in IFLS. On the other tail,
aggregating junior high with senior high or more, the fractions for men are higher in CHARLS for
both men and women.
As noted by Lei et al. (2012), the fraction of women with low education in CHARLS is much
smaller for the mid-aged compared to the elderly. If we take the ratio of women with no schooling
or some primary to those with junior high and above, for the elderly it is 62/11 and for the mid-aged
it is 35/43. For men in CHARLS the same ratio is 29/33 for the elderly and 13/66 for mid-aged men.
In IFLS the same ratios have a large turnaround, but smaller than for CHARLS, especially for
women: 67/15 to 46/29.
Attained mean heights are larger in CHARLS for both men and women, by about 4.5cm, a
fairly large amount and statistically significant at 1%. In both samples heights are larger for the midaged than the elderly, which had been shown with IFLS data by Strauss and Thomas (1995) among

1

IFLS does not cover eastern Indonesia, which is the poorer part of the country. The sample weights help correct for this.

14

others, and is generally true over the twentieth century in developing countries, height has been
increasing by later birth cohort in most countries.
Comparable fractions of elderly men are currently married between CHARLS and IFLS, but
a much larger fraction of CHARLS women are married, again the country differences being
significant, at 1%. This may reflect a higher older male mortality rate in Indonesia, and also lower
divorce rates in China.
Finally, larger fractions of men and women have agricultural hukou in CHARLS than are
rural residents in IFLS. Part of that is because recent urban migrants in China often have agricultural
hukou. Since this comparison uses sampling weights, it should not reflect sampling factors, which
are more urban-centered in IFLS than CHARLS.
Table 7 shows the coefficient on the female dummy variable in the base specification that
contains 5-year age dummies within each of the two broad age groups, dummies for district or
county of residence and a rural dummy.2 The coefficient for each of the 2 broad age groups is shown
for each of the 3 cognition measures. For mental intactness we only show it for the 60 and over age
group since in IFLS it is only available for the respondents 50 and over.
The female coefficient is more negative for the elderly than the mid-aged in both China and
Indonesia; it is statistically significant at under 5% in all cases. Furthermore, the coefficient is more
negative, and significantly so at under 1%, in the CHARLS data for both W-scores and mental
intactness, but is approximately the same for word recall. For example, for the W-scores, the female
dummy coefficient for the 45-59 year group is -25.9 for IFLS and -33.7 for CHARLS. For the 60
and over group the coefficients are -36.7 for IFLS and -56.7 for CHARLS. Remember, these Wscores are directly comparable across the two countries.
For the other cognition measures, the gender differences by age groups also exist. For word
recall in IFLS, the female coefficient is -.15 for the mid-aged group and -.29 for the elderly, both

15

significant; while for CHARLS it is -.08 and -.27 respectively for the 45-59 and 60 plus age groups.
For mental intactness for the elderly, the difference between IFLS and CHARLS female
disadvantage is large, -.85 for IFLS and -1.95 for CHARLS.
We now examine how the gender differential is affected as we add additional SES covariates,
discussed above. Tables 8 and 9 show results for number series, word recall and mental intactness
for the 60 and older groups in CHARLS and Tables 10 and 11 for IFLS. Appendix Tables 2 and 3
show the results for 45-59 year respondents in CHARLS and Appendix Table 4 for IFLS. In each
case we first add individual and household level SES covariates, then community variables with
interactions with the female dummy allowing for differential effects for women and men; and finally
community fixed effects.
The gender differential on the W-score moves to under 1/5 its level in CHARLS and under
1/3 in IFLS once own education level dummies are added along with a linear spline in household
assets, linear height and a dummy for being married. It is still statistically significant at the 5% level.
The female differential between CHARLS and IFLS is no longer significant once SES covariates are
added. The female differentials in CHARLS and IFLS do not change further as we add community
fixed effects in column 4 or community mean schooling levels and asset variables, interacted with
the female dummy, in column 3.
For word recall, we see that the gender dummy turns sign to positive for both CHARLS and
IFLS and is significant as SES variables are added (becoming positive is consistent with results for
CHARLS in Lei et al., 2014). For CHARLS the mental intactness coefficient drops to ¼ of its level
as SES covariates are added, while for IFLS it becomes slightly positive, but insignificant. For both
word recall and mental intactness in both CHARLS and IFLS, the female coefficient does not change
much when community variables or fixed effects are added.
All three cognition measures are monotonically decreasing in 5-year age groups within the
broader age group categories and the age dummies are jointly significant at under 1% in both broad

16

age groups. For both 45-59 and 60 and above age groups the age gradients for all three cognition
measures are smaller once own SES covariates are added, probably in part because older respondents
have lower schooling in both countries and low education is associated with lower cognition.
Own schooling levels have positive, significant and monotonically increasing coefficients for
all three cognition measures. The coefficient magnitudes are large for the W-scores, especially for
the elderly. They are substantially larger in magnitude than the coefficients on the female and age
dummies in the same regressions. Being larger in magnitude for the older age group may reflect a
mortality selection effect that older respondents with higher levels of schooling are more positively
selected than for younger age groups.
Log of household pce has positive, significant associations with the cognition measures, for
values below the sample median (the knot point used) for the CHARLS sample, but the coefficient
magnitudes are much smaller and are not significant for the IFLS sample. However, the differences
between CHARLS and IFLS for household pce coefficients are not statistically significant.
Height is positively and significantly related to all the cognition measures in both CHARLS
and IFLS samples. The magnitude of the height coefficients for the W-scores are small in IFLS, and
larger, but not significantly so, in CHARLS. For word recall and mental intactness the coefficient
magnitudes are similar. In the CHARLS sample, a 10 cm increase in height, which is very large, is
associated with an 11.2 point increase in the W-score for the elderly, while in IFLS with only a 6.4
point increase. Height in this case is a reflection of childhood health, but its association with the Wscores is less in magnitude than are schooling levels or age, and less too than being female (except
for an exceptionally large, 10 cm, increase in height).
The marriage dummy has differing associations with different cognition tests for the elderly
in CHARLS and IFLS. In the CHARLS elderly sample, being married is generally associated with
better cognition, significant in most cases, but the coefficient magnitudes are small compared to the
other SES variables. In the IFLS elderly sample, for number series, being married is associated with

17

a significantly lower W-score, though the magnitude is small. The difference in the marriage
coefficient is significant between CHARLS and IFLS. For word recall, there is a positive
relationship, significant at 5%, while for mental intactness no relationship exists. For the mid-aged
group, 45-59 in CHARLS, being married is positively and significantly associated only with word
recall, not with the W-score or mental intactness. In IFLS it is only weakly significant (at 10%) with
the number series.
Overall, a positive association of marriage with cognition may represent a selection effect.
Those elderly who are married, conditional on age, may be healthier with healthier spouses, and have
better cognition. It may also reflect the “protective” influences of marriage, so often observed on
outcomes such as labor earnings. However, as seen, the association of marriage, conditional on other
SES covariates, with cognition is not systematic across the different cognition measures, nor across
the two country samples.
Community influences
The base specification contains district dummy variables, plus a dummy variable for living in
a rural area for IFLS and a dummy for having an agricultural hukou for CHARLS. The agricultural
hukou dummy is negative and significant in the CHARLS base specifications for all three cognition
variables, and the magnitudes are large, a little less than the female dummy coefficients for the Wscore and mental intactness, but more negative for word recall. The coefficient magnitudes drop
considerably when SES covariates are introduced, but are still significant. They drop a little more,
but still significant, when community covariates are introduced.
In the IFLS sample, the rural dummy coefficients are small, 1/3 of the female dummy
coefficient for the W-score, but larger for word recall and mental intactness, roughly comparable in
size to the gender differential. The rural coefficients are substantially and significantly smaller for
IFLS than for CHARLS. When SES covariates are added the IFLS rural differential greatly shrinks
and becomes insignificant for W-score and word recall. The difference between IFLS and CHARLS

18

coefficients are now not significant. For mental intactness it shrinks by 1/3 to ½ but is still
significant when SES variables are added and the differential between CHARLS and IFLS is still
significant at 5%. When community variables are added the rural dummy further shrinks and
becomes insignificant for mental intactness. The same pattern is observed for the mid-aged group,
except that in the CHARLS results, the rural hukou differentials are somewhat larger for the elderly
than the mid-aged.
Following Lei et al. (2012, 2014) in the third columns we add community mean values for
the schooling level dummies and log household pce, taking a linear spline again for mean log pce.
We also include interactions of the community variables for females, allowing for differential effects
by gender. We still control for respondent level schooling level and log pce of the respondent
households, as well as for other individual characteristics. The community means are calculated
removing values for the reference respondent. The community means will reflect several factors
controlling for respondent covariates, including the relative position of the respondent within the
community. In the fifth and final column we present results with community fixed effects, that will
account for all observed and unobserved community influences. These results are similar to the
results when we add SES covariates. The community dummies are always jointly significant.
The observed uninteracted community variables for IFLS are jointly significant at 5% or
better for all three cognition measures, for the elderly group, but not for CHARLS. In the case of
IFLS it is the community mean schooling level variables that are responsible for this. Increasing
levels of community schooling, conditional on own schooling, are associated with higher W-scores
and word recall correct answers. The size of the community mean schooling level coefficients are
smaller than the coefficients for respondent schooling levels.
However, for CHARLS when we consider interactive community effects with the female
dummy plus the level coefficients, they are always jointly significant. The interaction coefficients
themselves are jointly significant for the W-score (at 10%) and mental intactness (at under 1%), but

19

not for word recall. Higher mean community schooling and higher mean log pce have significantly
more positive associations for elderly women than men for W-scores and word recall, consistent with
what Lei et al. (2014) found for the mid-aged and elderly in China. However, the community
associations of mean schooling and mean pce for women are smaller than it is for respondent’s own
education and pce.
For IFLS the coefficients on mean community education, and to a lesser extent mean
household pce, are higher for women for W-scores and mental intactness, but are lower for word
recall. The female interactions are jointly significant at 5% for all three cognition measures.
It is not clear what the exact pathways behind these relationships may be; one possibility is
that higher community mean schooling may be correlated with better quality social networks within
which one has social interactions, which may be better for elderly women than men in Indonesia.
These relationships are different for the mid-aged group. For IFLS, the community variables
are not jointly significant for any of the cognition measures. However, once we allow for differential
effects for women, the community coefficients plus the interactions are jointly significant at under
the 1% level, being higher for women for both mean community education and household pce. For
CHARLS it is again the interactions with female that make the community coefficients jointly
significant. Now the associations with community education and pce are smaller for women than for
men for the W-score, but the reverse for word recall, and mixed results for mental intactness. The
coefficients for mean community education and pce are smaller than those for the respondent’s own.

Conclusions
This paper examines three different measures of cognition in China and Indonesia among
respondents aged 45 and older. We concentrate on a measure of fluid intelligence: an adaptive block
number series test, plus a measure of episodic memory and a measure of mental intactness. The
number series test is new for population surveys in developing countries, and has been specially

20

modified from the version used in the Health and Retirement Study in the US to be better suited to
low income, low education environments.
We first examine the properties of our cognition measures, focusing on whether there exists
variation, particularly among the lowest education and oldest age groups. This has been a concern of
some social scientists in the past and some worry about number series in this regard. We find there
does exist plentiful variation in both China and Indonesia even among older people (aged 60 and
above) with no schooling. The three measures are correlated, but not perfectly, so they are not
measuring the exact same dimension of cognition.
We explore the socio-economic gradients for these measures, separately for middle-aged 4559 and elderly 60 and above. We focus in part on the gender differential, finding a significant,
negative differential for women. This differential is less for the mid-aged group, for whom the
schooling differentials are smaller, and considerably larger, statistically significantly so, in China. It
declines substantially once we control for SES characteristics, with the country differences no longer
being statistically significant. Adding community measures related to mean schooling and asset
levels does not much affect the gender differential.
Schooling levels are monotonically and significantly related to higher levels of cognition for
all three of the variables we use, in both China and Indonesia. The magnitudes of the schooling
coefficients are relatively large. Higher household per capita expenditure is also positively
associated with cognition, more so in China. Height, too, is positively associated with better
cognition, although the magnitudes are not large in Indonesian, but larger in China.
There are large rural deficits for the elderly in cognition, larger and significantly so in China,
which become smaller once socio-economic covariates are added, with the country differential no
longer being significant. Community mean schooling and mean log pce for the elderly are generally
positive and significantly related to the cognition measures we consider in Indonesia, especially for
community schooling. For China it is only for women that the community variables are jointly

21

significant. The effects are often more positive for women, especially for elderly women. For midaged respondents the community variables have a much more mixed set of results.
We must stress that the data are cross-sectional because the number series measures are only
available in one wave for both CHARLS and IFLS. Hence we cannot say anything about dynamics
of fluid intelligence and its SES gradients. With future waves of CHARLS and IFLS we will be able
to examine changes.
