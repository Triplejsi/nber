Death of the Salesman, But Not the Sales Force: How Interested Promotion Skews Scientific
Valuation

ABSTRACT
Whereas recent research has demonstrated how disinterested social validation may skew
valuation in meritocratic domains, interested promotion may be at least as important a factor. As
suggested by research on reputational entrepreneurship, a producer's death shifts promotion
opportunities in two respects. First, it prevents the producer (or “salesman”) from engaging in
promotional activity. Second, it also mobilizes others (the “sales force”) to step up their
promotional activity on behalf of the deceased. Analysis of the impact made by the premature
death of 720 elite life scientists on the citation trajectories of their articles indicates that death
results in a long-lasting, positive increase in citation rates, relative to the trajectories for
equivalent articles by counterfactual, still-living scientists. This effect seems due largely to the
memorialization efforts made by the sales force as compared to recognition efforts on behalf of
the still-living scientists, and is strongest for articles that had received relatively little attention
prior to the death, as well as those authored by stars who died at a relatively young age. The
upshot is clear evidence of informational inefficiency, which derives from the challenges of
absorbing the massive volume of scientific knowledge produced. Scientists' identities thus play
an important role in determining scientific valuations, despite ostensible norms that enjoin the
scientific community to divorce the researcher's identity from her work.

Introduction
While it may seem obvious that buyers should not “judge a book by its cover,” sellers’

promotional efforts continue apace, in the apparently reasonable expectation that buyers will
struggle and often fail to discount the seller’s biases. This struggle is especially salient in
meritocratic domains, those governed and justified by strong norms enjoining participants
to ignore social and physical cues and instead to assess products and producers purely on
the basis of underlying quality. Consider science as the quintessential meritocratic domain,
marked by widespread deference to the norms of “universalism” and “disinterestedness”
(Merton 1979). Consider too that an important way of judging the health of a scientific
field is whether it is informationally efficient: when scientific advances are made (according
to the criteria of the field’s dominant paradigm, however imperfect it may be), are they
recognized as such and does this recognition diffuse quickly? If some scientific papers owe
their recognition not to the underlying quality of the work but to the fact that they benefited
from more effective promotion, this would defy meritocratic norms and hinder informational
efficiency. At the limit, if science were just about who had access to the biggest promotional
platform and/or used it most cleverly, public confidence in science would be misplaced.
The question of whether such interested promotion of science limits the efficiency of
scientific valuation can be better appreciated in the context of recent research on disinterested
validation in meritocratic domains (see especially Azoulay et al. 2014; Salganik et al. 2006;
Simcoe and Waguespack 2011; van de Rijt 2019). Common to research on this type of social
cue are three insights. First, given the widespread challenge of distinguishing higher quality
products and producers as well as the common need to coordinate on the basis of quality
(Correll et al. 2017), third-parties naturally emerge in meritocratic domains to aggregate
and publicize informed assessments of quality (Zuckerman 1999; Espeland and Sauder 2007).
Second, even when these assessments are produced in a disinterested manner—e.g., by expert
panels (Azoulay et al. 2014; Simcoe and Waguespack 2011) or by anonymous peers (Salganik
1

et al. 2006; van de Rijt 2019), they can skew valuations to produce informational inefficiency.
In particular, when recognition is bestowed on one product/producer before it is bestowed
on an equivalent one, the former may benefit from a “Matthew Effect,” whereby the initial
validation skews subsequent sampling, evaluation, and investment patterns. Finally, such
advantages can be empirically identified via counterfactuals derived from situations where
the same evaluative standards are used but disinterested validation of some products is higher
for reasons that are unrelated to quality. This can occur either because (i) an experimenter
has subdivided a population into sub-populations, and public quality assessments of the
very same products happen in a different sequence in each sub-population (Salganik et al.
2006; van de Rijt 2019); or (ii) an agent can only validate the quality of a limited number
of products, thus entailing that a subset of equivalent products will have the bad fortune
of not being validated (Azoulay et al. 2014; Bol et al. 2018). Overall, these studies have
produced clear evidence of informational inefficiency, though it is hardly overwhelming in its
magnitude.
But insofar as disinterested validation of these varieties are distinct from the types of
efforts at interested promotion mentioned above, it is unclear whether the latter type of
social cue might also skew valuation and produce unfair advantage. On the one hand, the
norm of “disinterestedness” enjoins scientists and scientific institutions to sanction scientists
for attempting to boost the value of their work for personal gain (Merton 1942: 124). Accordingly, self-citations are often eliminated when assessing scientific contributions as they
are thought to be biased. Yet given the overwhelming volume of scientific research that is
produced and the career stakes involved in gaining recognition, it is hardly surprising that
scientists may be seen promoting their work in a wide variety of ways—on their vitae, on
their web sites, at academic conferences, in the introductions to their papers, etc.
Moreover, there is reason to think that such efforts at interested promotion can influence
the reception of science despite widespread fealty to the norm of disinterestedness and efforts
to enforce it. In short, it is often difficult and even undesirable for scientists to treat interested
promotion as biased. In particular, those with the most interest in a given line of work are
often regarded as the most knowledgeable, and as having the greatest incentive to accurately
assess its quality (Li 2017; Teplitskiy et al. 2018). After all, it is generally a worrying
sign if a producer is not willing to stand by their work. A related consideration is that
scientific movements often require a critical mass of contributors to make progress; as such,
it is quite natural for scientists to promote work as a way of enlisting additional hands on

2

deck (Botelho 2018). Finally, even if it is reasonable to dismiss a scientist’s efforts at selfpromotion as irremediably biased, it is more questionable whether one should dismiss efforts
by the scientist’s colleagues on his behalf. The upshot is that interested promotion generally
falls into a normative gray area, making it difficult and often inadvisable to discount for its
influence.
One implication of these considerations is to provide another basis for the Matthew Effect,
whereby effectiveness in the promotion of scientific work is increasing in a scientist’s status.
But it also suggests that we can gain distinctive insight into the efficiency of the scientific
valuation process by identifying contingencies that affect the manner and degree to which
scientific work is actively promoted. In particular, research on reputational entrepreneurship
in political and cultural contexts suggests that the death of a “producer”—i.e., an artist,
politician, or scientist—provides a unique window into how shifts in the opportunity structure
for interested promotion can have a significant impact on how the producer’s work is valued.
This literature identifies two countervailing effects of a producer’s death on such opportunities: on the one hand, death prevents the producer from playing the role of “salesman” in
publicizing and promoting himself and his products; but on the other hand, the producer’s
death can influence how other parties play the role of a “sales force” in publicizing and promoting the producer’s work (Bromberg and Fine 2002: 1139). In some cases, the death of
the producer appears to have a negative effect on his legacy by eliminating the salesman. For
example, in accounting for why U.S. President Warren Harding is the “worst president of all
time” (Holmes and Elder 1989), Fine (1996) notes that Harding was a reasonably popular
and effective president during his lifetime; however, his early death in 1923 prevented him
from defending his reputation in the wake of the Teapot Dome scandal while his erstwhile
supporters had every incentive to let him take the blame. Yet while the death of the producer
can have a negative impact on his legacy, it can paradoxically have a positive effect insofar as
it mobilizes a sales force composed of people who were positively influenced by the producer
during her lifetime. Thus, Lang and Lang (1988) document how the sudden death of young
etchers mobilized friends and family to commemorate the œuvre of the deceased, thereby
making it less likely that the artist would be forgotten by the next generation. Fine (1996)
too contrasts Harding’s death with John F. Kennedy’s, showing that Kennedy’s supporters
commemorated his life and work to such an extent that he became one of America’s most
popular presidents after his death, despite a rather brief and controversial term as president.

3

What then is the impact of scientists’ deaths, especially the premature deaths of young
scientists, on the valuation of those scientists’ work? If the scientific valuation process is
highly efficient (in discounting any bias in efforts to promote science) then the death of a
scientist should have no impact on the valuation of her work. But if indeed a given scientific
community is hard pressed to absorb the work produced by its members and to discount
any bias in promotional activities, contingent shifts in promotional opportunities can make
a difference either by reducing recognition for the scientist’s work (if what matters most is
the scientist’s self-promotion efforts) or increasing recognition for her work (if promotional
efforts by supporters make the bigger difference).
To preview our findings, our analysis of elite academic life scientists shows that a scientist’s death tends to provide a boost to their papers’ citation trajectories, and it does so by
mobilizing scholars seeking to memorialize the deceased, thereby promoting her work and
reputation posthumously. As a result, these scholars’ research enjoys greater recognition
than that of still-living scientists. We also find that these effects appear to be long-lasting;
for up to ten years after their deaths (a relatively long time relative to the citation half-life
of articles in this field), the authors’ work continues to be cited more than comparable work
by scientists who had not yet died. The effect is not uniformly distributed. It is more pronounced for those who are most memorialized; and consistent with Lang and Lang (1988),
such memorialization is disproportionate when the death occurs at a relatively young age.
Additionally, it is the scientist’s least-cited papers at the time of death which see the largest
boost in posthumous citations. Taken together, these findings suggest that the promotional
efforts of the sales force are effective in shifting valuations, and that the effect occurs due to
an attention shift in the context of limited capacity for attending to the massive amount of
scientific output.

2

Theory
Our paper examines the impact of contingent shifts in the opportunity structure for

promotion on the informational efficiency of scientific valuation. To clarify the theoretical
issues at stake, it is useful to consider what has been accomplished by recent research that
examines the effect of contingent shifts in social cues on meritocratic valuation. In short,
this research, which has largely been described as testing the Matthew Effect (Azoulay et
al. 2014; Simcoe and Waguespack 2011) or cumulative advantage (Salganik et al. 2006;

4

Salganik and Watts 2008), has demonstrated that disinterested validation can shape which
products/producers are more highly valued (as measured by citations or downloads, in the
cases above). However, it is unclear whether interested promotion can have a substantial
impact and what specific mechanisms might be responsible. To the extent that the Mertonian
norms of universalism and disinterestedness govern science, one would expect scientists and
scientific institutions to discount such efforts (Merton 1942). Yet scientific communities may
find it difficult and even inadvisable to completely dismiss such promotional efforts given that
they may be reliable signals of quality. This ambivalence may make interested promotion
an effective means of boosting valuations, both by the focal scientist, and by his or her
supporters.

2.1

Disinterested Validation

A key contribution of recent research is methodological, in that it has shown that the
clearest way to demonstrate that social signals shape valuation is through the use of counterfactuals that are identical or observationally equivalent to the focal products/services but
do not enjoy the same degree of social validation. For example, the Columbia MusicLab
experiment induces alternative popularity trajectories for the very same song depending on
whether it is evaluated in one of several different “social” worlds (in which popularity information is visible, such that songs’ initial popularity influences their later popularity) or in an
“asocial” world in which popularity information is not given (Salganik et al. 2006; Salganik
and Watts 2008); Similarly, Azoulay and colleagues (2014) study of how the conferral of
status on life scientists by a prestigious foundation (the Howard Hughes Medical Institute
or HHMI) affects the citation trajectories of the scientists’ previously-published papers is
based on the premise that near-equivalent scientists (not anointed by HHMI) and papers (as
discussed below) may serve as counterfactuals.
It is important to appreciate what this literature has demonstrated to date, and what
its limitations are. First, this research is focused on informational efficiency rather than allocative efficiency (Sethi 2010; Stout 1995; Zuckerman 2012b). Put differently, this research
focuses on whether a particular community assigns valuations in a consistent manner as
specified by its dominant paradigm, but does not address whether the dominant paradigm is
in an objective sense “correct.” This is most obvious in the case of the MusicLab, as the key
question is the extent to which exposure to popularity information alters users’ perceptions
of what would meet their personal taste (Salganik et al. 2006: 854). The same question
5

is also implicitly operative in Azoulay et al. (2014) and Simcoe and Waguespack (2011):
although it is possible that the work of both the award winners and the counterfactual scientists will eventually be dismissed as having little value (thus implying allocative inefficiency),
this is a separate matter from the informational inefficiency implied when the work of the
award-winner is valued more highly than equivalent work by lower-status peers. Note that
this focus on informational efficiency is consistent with the thrust of science studies since the
1970s (Bloor 1973; Ziman 1983; Latour and Woolgar 1979; Shapin 1982), which has assailed
the epistemological premise that scientific valuations can achieve objectivity. Scientific valuation necessarily reflects contingent communal standards; and insofar as those standards
are necessarily limited, allocative efficiency is unattainable. But this begs the question of
whether a community applies its standards (however limited) in a consistent way. That is
the question of informational efficiency.
Second, each of these studies focuses on disinterested validation. In the case of the MusicLab, the implicit premise is that music fans are limited in their ability to sample the
vast universe of songs and so they look to their peers—who are presumed to have similar
tastes—to guide them.1 This guidance is disinterested because it comes as a byproduct of
these peers’ consumption behavior and because the anonymity of the setting ensures that
no one has an interest in promoting one song or another. Note also that this guidance is
meritocratic in that it is ostensibly based on “the satisfaction of quality standards that can
be articulated independently of the options available”(Correll et al. 2017: 299). Research
on the Matthew Effect in science is similar in both these respects. For example, the HHMI
is presumed to be both disinterested and meritocratic due to its institutional mandate to
support high-quality research and from the review process’s adherence to the norm of universalism.
Third, it is important to note how research on the Matthew Effect in science adds to
research on cumulative advantage in cultural markets, at least as examined in experimental
conditions where participants are anonymous and thus indifferent to how their valuations
appear to others. There are two notable and potentially countervailing differences between
these contexts (cf. Zuckerman 2012a): (i) the prospect of tangible rewards for scientific
advances that are independent of the valuation of the academic community and (ii) careerbased social pressures in science that make scientists sensitive to their colleagues’ opinions.
1

Notably, if they discover that their peers have very different tastes than they do, they tend to reject
their guidance, and the social influence effect wanes (Salganik and Watts 2008; van de Rijt 2019).

6

The first point derives from the premise that science is not purely a matter of taste; as
such, there are significant rewards available to the scientist who challenges the dominant
paradigm and successfully develops or inspires a piece of technology whose value becomes
undeniable even to initial skeptics (e.g., polymerase chain reaction, CRISPR gene editing,
or angiogenesis inhibitors). The second point derives from the premise that scientists’ career
outcomes are determined by their fellow scientists, and this can induce significant pressure
to conform to the dominant paradigm (it can also induce pressure to differentiate from their
colleagues as competitors; ibid.). Given these two countervailing effects, one which rewards
scientists for challenging convention and the other for adhering to convention, it is unclear ex
ante whether the effect of social signals on valuation should be stronger or weaker in science
relative to cultural markets. It is instructive then that while the results of recent studies
demonstrate that the Matthew Effect is real, its magnitude seems relatively small (Azoulay
et al. 2014), thus implying a relatively low level of informational inefficiency.

2.2

Interested Promotion

Yet while this research has made important progress in assessing how social signals affect
valuation, its focus on disinterested validation is necessarily limiting. After all, many social
signals are conveyed by interested parties, and they too may have a significant impact on
valuation. In cultural markets, such efforts are so commonplace as to be obvious: though
Billboard may rank songs by market share (the equivalent of the disinterested validation
provided in the MusicLab), this in no way deters artists and music labels from promoting
their work through the use of advertisements, radio and playlist spots, television appearances,
etc.2 The prevalence of such promotional efforts is important for present purposes because it
implies that market participants do not think that the market is informationally efficient(cf.
Zuckerman 1999: 1430-1431). Rather, given the vast number of options available and the
search costs associated with sampling them, efforts to gain the attention of consumers seem
necessary.3 And as documented by marketing scholars (Van den Bulte and Lillien 2001),
these efforts can pay off, by raising consumer awareness of the focal product or producer
along with consumers’ perceptions of quality. Although consumers are typically aware that
2

It is possible—if unlikely—that some of MusicLab participants had an interest in promoting the bands
they favored. To the extent that this was the case, then the social cues would be a mix of disinterested
validation and interested promotion. The specific contribution of interested promotion efforts would remain
unknown, however.
3
Tucker and Zhang (2011) show that disinterested validation is more influential when there is less information available ex ante about consumption options.

7

such efforts are biased attempts to sway their consumption behavior, they may be quite
effective nonetheless.
But it is an open question whether and to what extent interested promotion may shape
social valuation in science, affecting the informational efficiency of a given domain and thus
potentially allocative efficiency as well. Insofar as scientific communities are governed by
the norm of disinterestedness (Merton 1942), we might expect promotional efforts to be
limited. Yet the same conditions that provide an impetus for promotional efforts in other
settings—very large number of options and significant search costs—apply in science as well.
As such, and given competition for scarce jobs and resources, scientists have good reason
to fear that their work will not be noticed, thereby leading them to act as “salesmen”
in promoting their work. Such promotion does not stop with the focal scientist herself;
scientists often promote the work of others whom they know and respect. Although such
promotional efforts are often presented as being disinterested and they may be less selfinterested than those of the salesmen, efforts by friends and colleagues—whom we term
“the sales force”—to promote another’s work are not disinterested to the same degree as
an anonymous ranking system (such as the MusicLab) or a third-party award (such as the
HHMI). In particular, there is no comparable mandate or commitment by the promoter to
assess a range of potentially meritorious candidates. In addition, the promoter may benefit
either from reciprocal arrangements or the increased status of a shared field (Reschke et al.
2018).
But does (interested) promotion of scientific work significantly shape scientific valuation;
and if so, how? Note in this regard Merton’s claim regarding the norm of disinterestedness
was not that scientists are more moral and therefore less likely to attempt to boost scientific
efforts for personal gain; rather, he argued that the institutions of science would be able to
check such actions and prevent them from being effective (Merton 1942). Thus, one reason
to doubt that interested promotion has a substantial impact is that scientific communities
employ various practices—from removing self-citations from citation counts to avoiding advisors and coauthors when requesting journal referees and tenure letters—that are meant to
counteract bias.
Yet as noted above, this is just one side of the coin. As with conflicts of interest in other
domains, a scientist’s investment in a subfield or a particular line of work (their own, or that

8

of a colleague) actually has ambiguous implications.4 In particular, someone who is interested
in a particular domain may favor that domain but she may also be more knowledgeable about
it and more concerned about vetting the quality in it. Thus as Li (2017) shows in her study of
scientists assessing grants at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), while scientists may be
biased in their valuations of quality in a manner that disproportionately benefits themselves
and their colleagues, these (interested) scientists are also most accurate in their assessments
as they know more about their own domain and are most concerned about its trajectory.
Moreover, given that scientific movements often require the mobilization of many colleagues
to embark on complementary research, a natural consequence is that scientists will advertise
their work so as to facilitate such mobilization. Indeed, the failure to promote one’s work in
this fashion could even be interpreted as a negative signal.
The larger implication is that it is ultimately unclear whether and how scientists should
discount one another’s promotional efforts as they may be unsure whether such efforts are
poor signals of quality due to bias, or strong signals of quality due to aligned incentives. As
such, there is good reason to expect that interested promotion has a substantial impact on
the informational efficiency of scientific communities. In particular, the general implication
is that scientific work that benefits from more effective promotional efforts is more highly
valued than equivalent work that does not benefit from the same level and type of promotion.
A further implication is that if for whatever reason, a work of science benefits from extra
promotion that is ostensibly unbiased, it should have an even greater impact than work that
receives the same level of promotion but is perceived as biased.

2.3

Scientist’s Death as a Window into the Importance of Promotion

In order to assess these implications, we examine contingent shifts in opportunities for
promoting science occasioned by the premature death of scientists. Past research has demonstrated that a scientist’s death can be effectively used to study a given scientist’s impact on
the production of science (Azoulay et al. 2010; Azoulay et al. 2019; Oettl 2012). And as
discussed above, research on reputational entrepreneurship in cultural and political domains
4

This debate is common in many other domains outside of science. For instance, there is a long-standing
legal precedent for the common-law requirement of “legal standing,” meaning that a party must have been
adversely affected themselves before they can bring a law-suit forward (see for example Lujan v. Defenders
of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 [1992]).

9

suggests that we can make progress on the larger question of the impact of interested promotion on the efficiency of scientific valuation by examining how appreciation for a scientist’s
published work changes as a result of his death. Since the quality of such work (which was
published in the past) is obviously unaffected by the death of its author, it should have no
impact on how it is valued, as measured by the trajectory of citations to that paper.5 More
specifically, to the extent that promotional efforts are biased and the scientific community
successfully discounts for such biases, any effect of changes in promotional efforts due to the
death should be negligible.
We have noted, however, why it is unlikely that such biases are fully discounted. And
the literature on reputational entrepreneurship in cultural and political domains implies two
pathways by which the death of a producer can impact how his work is valued based on how
the death affects promotional activity. One possibility, as reflected in Fine’s (1996) study of
Warren Harding discussed above, is that the valuation of scientific works will fall after the
author’s death. Scientists who believe their research is undervalued by the community may
seek to raise awareness of it through press releases, teaching graduate courses, presenting at
conferences, etc. This implies that at any given point in time, the level of citations a paper
receives is a function of the quality of the paper (according to the dominant paradigm)
and the amount of “salesmanship” it has received. Thus, since the death of the scientist
eliminates the latter factor, the number of citations should decline.
Second, as in the case of JFK above, insofar as the death of a scientist leads scientists
supporters to “memorialize” their deaths, it may generate an increase in the valuation of
her work. Lang and Lang’s study of etchers provides intriguing evidence for how death
can spur supporters to initiate celebrations of the artist’s life and work via “recognition
events”—biographies, news articles, and exhibits of their life and oeuvre (Lang and Lang
1988: 94). To be sure, recognitions of a producer’s entire œuvre often occur while she is still
alive—a festschrift is a common form of such recognition for scholars—but recognition events
seem more common in the aftermath of the producers death. In Lang and Lang’s research,
such events directed the etching field’s attention to the work of the deceased, thereby raising
its perceived value to such an extent that memorialized etchers were remembered vastly
5

Citations are necessarily a measure of attention (Merton 1988) but an imperfect measure of communal
valuation given that some citations are negative. However, recent research (Catalini et al. 2015) on a subfield
(immunology) within the larger domain studied here finds that only 2.4% of the total have a negative valence.
A more subtle issue is that citations may not reflect the citer’s personal assessment of quality, but rather
the assessment of quality she thinks will coordinates well with journal referees and readers (see Correll et al.
2017). We will return to this issue in the discussion.

10

beyond their living counterparts, even those who did superior work (Lang and Lang 1988:
97).
Importantly, Lang and Lang report that such memorialization was most impactful when
the artist died at a young age. Lang and Lang’s (1988) example of Elizabeth Fyfe is emblematic:
Fyfe, who died in Switzerland in 1933, just after her thirty-fourth birthday after a long
bout with tuberculosis, had been hailed by British critics as “one of the most original
and accomplished young etchers.” That her name and her work, which amounted to
just over 1,600 impressions, somehow survive, whereas those of others once equally
or better known do not, has much to do with her premature death. Her teachers,
her friends, her collectors, and other etchers rallied, while she was in the hospital, to
organize an exhibition of her work, complete with catalog, and then used the proceeds
from sales to help pay for the care she needed. Her dealer saw to it that her plates were
printed when she could no longer do so herself and gave a full set of her prints to Fyfe’s
sister. In this way, the many persons mobilized by the tragedy helped to preserve the
work and, thereby, to sustain the memory of the artist.

An important factor noted here—the preservation of the artist’s otherwise perishable
work—seems to apply to art but not to science. At the same time, science seems comparable
to art and politics in that recognition events will be relative rare for the young if they
remain alive. Note further that young producers in a given domain tend to have more living
supporters than those who die at an advanced age. Moreover, the deaths of those in the prime
of their career are surprising and more likely to be experienced as tragic; as such, they may
be more likely to mobilize a community that is keen to ensure that the scientist’s work not
be forgotten. However well intentioned, such collective efforts at interested promotion have
the potential to provide an ironic benefit to the dead scientist’s work via a boost in positive
attention as compared with equivalent scientists who have the good fortune to remain alive.

2.4

Empirical Implications

Thus the death of a scientist implies a contingent shift in opportunities for interested
promotion. As such, it provides a lens through which we can examine how the informational efficiency of a scientific field is affected by interested promotion. If a given scientific
field quickly and fully incorporates new advances (according to the criteria of its dominant
paradigm), this would imply that the timing of the deaths of authors should not matter for
how their research is valued, as measured by citation trajectories. But if such incorporation

11

is incomplete and the field is not able to discount for any bias produced by interested promotion, such promotion—as elicited by a scientist—can shift the level of appreciation for
their work in one or both of two ways.
In particular, there are four possible ways that the valuation of a scientist’s work may be
affected by her death. One possibility is that any shift in interested promotion has no impact
and scientific valuation is informationally efficient in this respect. The three other scenarios
reflect some degree of informational inefficiency, whereby efforts at interested promotion are
not fully discounted. Thus a second possibility is that scientific valuations are significantly
sustained by the efforts of the scientist himself; this would imply that the death of the
“salesman” causes a decrease in citations to the scientist‘s papers. A third possibility is
that scientific valuations are significantly sustained by the efforts of a scientist‘s supporters;
and if the death of a scientist catalyzes the mobilization of this “sales force,” a boost in
citations will ensue. Finally, it is possible that both channels have significant impact, but
cancel each other out. As long as either the underlying “salesman” or “sales force” effect
can be identified, such an indeterminant outcome might still imply a significant degree of
informational inefficiency in the field.
There is no strong theoretical basis for predicting which of these scenarios is most likely.
At the same time, the first possibility seems unlikely. In general, informational efficiency in
a domain requires effective tools for arbitrage (or “valuation opportunism”; see Zuckerman
2012b) whereby someone who recognizes a gap between quality and social valuation can
profit from this gap even when others do not recognize it. But while such mechanisms do
exist in various scientific fields (e.g., scientific contributions can be turned into technologies
whose value is so apparent they cannot be denied), they tend to be relatively weak. More
specifically, and as reviewed above, it seems unlikely that scientific fields are able fully
discount for biases that might be incorporated in efforts at interested promotion.
At the same time, it is not clear whether the mobilization of the sales force should
overcome the absence of the salesman. On the one hand, the salesman has the most incentive
to promote his own work, and, therefore, is likely to do the most promoting. On the other
hand, the efficacy of such efforts may be limited by the fact that the scientist is only one
person and his motives are transparently self-interested. As noted above, a key implication
of our theoretical framework is that interested promotion should be more effective when
those interests do not connote bias. Moreover, conditional on mobilization, the number of

12

individuals in the sales force can potentially be much larger than a single scientist, and, as
noted above, their efforts are unlikely to be viewed as entirely self-interested. These factors
may be responsible for the evidence of the importance of posthumous “sales force” activity
documented in the literature on reputational entrepreneurship (Lang and Lang 1988; Fine
2003). And yet we have noted that an important factor in such studies but absent from
science is the role of the sales force in preserving a producer’s work. As such, we make no
prediction as to which of the three other scenarios is most likely. Rather, our goal is to
leverage our analysis to make progress in understanding whether interested promotion skews
valuations and which channel is most important in doing so.
Our goal of learning about the relative importance of different channels for interested
promotion is furthered by two more specific goals: (i) to assess the importance of key contingency factors that might alter the balance of the salesman and sales force effects; and (ii)
to examine whether the sales force effect indeed works via a spike in recognition events for
dead vs. still-living scientists.
With respect to the first of these goals, four contextual factors seem especially important.
First, as reviewed above, there is reason to think that the sales force effect will be especially
strong for the young, with the key reason being that these scientists would have received
much less recognition had they remained alive. Second, variation in the “engagement style”
of the scientist may have an important impact on either the salesman or sales force effects.
For example, scientists who tend to work with large research teams (coauthors, trainees)
may be expected to have larger (posthumous) sales forces. Also of interest is whether a
scientist was highly self-promotional while they were alive. On the one hand, they may be
dynamic personalities whose death catalyzes their colleagues to promote her work in her
stead. On the other hand, such scientists may be regarded as self-serving and be relatively
ineffective at eliciting a posthumous sales force. Third, it will be instructive to examine
how the shift in interested promotion impacts a scientist’s papers based on their baseline
citation level before their death. If a scientist’s most-cited papers earn the biggest citation
boost from a scientist’s death, this will imply a version of the Matthew Effect is at work
whereby interested promotion is most effective in combination with other forms of validation.
But if a scientist’s least-cited papers gain the most, this will imply a more narrow form of
inefficiency, whereby papers compete with another for scarce attention with some losing out
simply because of such scarcity. A spotlight on a scientist’s work will then increase the
likelihood that overlooked work will now get its due (Tucker and Zhang 2011). Finally, we

13

will not only examine changes in the number of citations to papers of the deceased vs. stillliving, but also changes in who the citers are (collaborators vs. non-collaborators; in the
same field vs. outsiders; whether they work for the same institution or not, etc.),
With respect to the second goal, it will be important not only to examine the effect of
death on citations to a scientist’s work but also the causes and effects of recognition events.
Insofar as a scientist’s death indeed elicits a positive boost in the valuation of his papers, it
may not be due to promotion by the sales force. For instance, it is possible that competitors
of the scientist who were stingy in their citations before now become more generous.6 As
such, it will be important to examine (i) whether indeed the death of a scientist elicits more
recognition events than if he had remained alive; and (ii) whether such recognition activity
is responsible for any observed sales force effect on citations.

3

Data and Empirical Design
The design of our empirical analysis unfolds in three separate steps. The first step is a

causal analysis: we examine how the premature death of an eminent biomedical academic
researcher changes the rate of citations to her work, compared to the work of other eminent researchers who do not die prematurely. The level of analysis for this step is an article/scientist
pair, and the main challenge to be overcome is the building of a control group of articles
that plausibly pin down the citation trajectories of the deceased scientists’ articles had they
remained alive. In the second step, we examine whether recognition activity is greater for
deceased scientists, controlling for a host of important correlates of individual recognition;
the level of analysis is the individual scientist and the key challenge is the measurement of
the recognition process, which is highly variegated and would, at first blush, appear to defy
efforts at quantitative reduction. The third and final step ties the earlier analyses together.
We ask whether the recognition process is a plausible mechanism through which scientific
work gets remembered in the long run. The main challenge is one of prediction: for each
article, we must be able to forecast the citation trajectory that would have been observed if
the scientist had remained alive, so as to isolate a net citation premium (or deficit) for this
article. With these forecasts in hand, we can then examine whether variation in recognition
intensity mediates the relationship between death and posthumous citations.
6

Conversely, it is possible that evidence for the salesman effect is in fact evidence for diminished motivation
to engage in strategic citation of the now-deceased scientist.

14

Below, we provide a detailed description of the process through which we assembled
the dataset used in the statistical analysis. We begin by describing the criteria used to
select the sample of elite academics, with a particular focus on the timing and the manner
of their deaths. The focus then shifts to the publications that deceased and still-living
scientists authored during their lifetimes, and how one might build a matched sample of
publication/scientist pairs where the citations received by articles authored by still-living
scientists offer a plausible counterfactual to the citations that articles authored by deceased
scientists would have received had they not died prematurely. Finally, we document how we
measured the recognition process for each individual scientist. Throughout this description
of the data, we outline how the construction of the sample addresses the empirical design
challenges enumerated above.

3.1

Institutional Context

Our empirical setting is the academic life sciences. We focus on this domain for three
reasons. The first is its sheer size: U.S. Medical Schools employ over 150,000 faculty members
and this figure underestimates the size of the labor market since it does not take into account
scientists and engineers working at NIH, in non-profit research organizations (such as the
Salk Institute), for independent hospitals (such as the Cleveland Clinic), or within Schools
of Arts and Sciences (such as MIT, UC Berkeley, or Rockefeller University). Academic
biomedical research also garners over 70% of all non-defense Federal R&D dollars. The large
size of the labor market is important for reasons of statistical power: our key source of
variation is generated by the premature death of eminent scientists, and these events are
relatively rare. Importantly, the members of this labor market share broadly similar norms,
career goals, incentives, and operate within comparable institutional structures.
Second, scientific discoveries over the past half-century have greatly expanded the knowledge frontier in the life sciences, and these advances have resulted in more specialization, as
well as an increase in the size of collaborative teams (Wuchty et al. 2007). These trends help
ensure that career shocks affect only relatively narrow swathes of the intellectual landscape.
Were our research domain less balkanized across narrow subfields, it would be challenging
for us to identify control articles or control scientists (Azoulay et al. 2019).
Third, and perhaps more pragmatically, our setting is blessed by an abundance of data
sources. The careers of eminent, still-living life scientists are extensively described in cur15

riculum vitæ, Who’s Who profiles, or laboratory web sites. We combine these data with the
free and publicly-available bibliographic database PubMed, citation information from the
Web of Science, and administrative records from the Faculty Roster of the Association of
American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and NIH’s Compound Grant Applicant File (CGAF).
Together, these sources of information allow us to create an accurate longitudinal record of
publications, citations, and funding for each scientist in the sample.
Our focus on the scientific elite is substantively justified in light of our goals. One would
expect the articles of eminent scientists to be identified and evaluated immediately after
their publication, relative to the articles authored by scientists of lesser repute. This should
in turn lessen the relevance of interested promotion in influencing how science is valued. To
some extent, this is testable since our metrics of eminence exhibit substantial heterogeneity
even within our sample of eminent scientists. That said, this approach has limitations as
well, which we discuss after presenting our findings.

3.2

Sample of Elite Academic Life Scientists

Following Azoulay et al. (2010) and Azoulay et al. (2019), we begin by demarcating
a set of 12,426 “elite” life scientists (roughly 5% of the entire relevant labor market) who
are so classified if they satisfy at least one of the following criteria for cumulative scientific
achievement: (i) highly funded scientists; (ii) highly cited scientists; (iii) top patenters; or
(iv) members of the National Academy of Science and the National Academy of Medicine.
Because these four measures rely on achievements over the course of a scientist’s career,
they will tend to select older scientists. To create more demographic balance, we add three
additional measures that capture individuals with promise at the early and middle stages
of their scientific careers (regardless of whether that success endures): (v) NIH MERIT
awardees; (vi) Howard Hughes Medical Investigators; and (vii) early career prize winners.
Appendix A provides additional details regarding these seven metrics of “stardom.”
We trace back these scientists’ careers from the time they obtained their first position
as independent investigators (typically after a postdoctoral fellowship) until 2006. We do
so through a combination of curriculum vitae, NIH biosketches, Who’s Who profiles, accolades/obituaries in medical journals, National Academy of Sciences biographical memoirs,
and Google searches. For each one of these individuals, we record employment history, degree

16

held, date of degree, gender, department affiliations, as well as complete list of publications,
patents, and NIH funding obtained in each year.7
The next step in the sample construction process is to select a subset of scientists from
this overall pool whose premature death will “treat” their past output. First, we select
scientists whose death intervenes between 1969 and 2003.8 Second, we need to ensure that
these scientists had not entered a pre-retirement phase of their career. This is trickier,
because the timing of retirement is endogenous, and scientists who do not wish to retire
can show great initiative in subverting rules surrounding mandatory retirement (which was
legal in the United States until 1986). To overcome this challenge, we make full use of the
narrative data contained in the dossiers we compiled for each scientist (deceased or not);
we also examine publication output as well as funding received to remove from the sample
those who either “meaningfully” retired or whose output shows sign of abating prior to their
death or the end of the observation period.9
As a result of these steps, we identify 720 “treated” scientists (see Table 1). The mean
and median age at death is approximately 64, with the youngest scientist dying at age 33 and
the oldest dying at age 91.10 We then investigate the cause of death in this sample to classify
their deaths as being either “sudden” or “anticipated.” The main motivation here is to better
identify when the “sales force” of those motivated to memorialize the scientist and his work
would have become mobilized; insofar as the death is anticipated, this mobilization could
begin prior to death. Distinguishing anticipated from sudden deaths is less difficult than it
appears, since most obituaries typically are quite specific in this respect.11 To distinguish
sudden from anticipated deaths, we use an arbitrary distinction between deaths that likely
occurred with six months notice or less, versus those that likely occurred with more than six
7

Appendix B details the steps taken to ensure that the list of publications is complete and accurate, even
in the case of stars with frequent last names.
8
An implication of this design choice is that even for the scientists who die “late” (e.g., in 2003), we will
have at least three years of citation data to pin down how their passing changes the recognition of their
work.
9
In previous work, one of us has verified that it is essentially impossible to predict death in a related
sample using measures of lagged publication output (Azoulay et al. 2010)
10
How can one die at a very advanced age, yet one’s passing still be deemed “premature?” Easily, as it
turns out. Aubrey Gorbman (1914-2003), described in academic obituaries as the “father” of the field of
comparative endocrinology (Bern and Sower 2003), succumbed to Parkinson’s disease but still published two
first-authored articles in the last year of his life.
11
In some instances, where the cause of death could not be ascertained from the obituaries, we contacted
former collaborators individually to clarify the circumstances of the superstar’s passing. We were unable to
ascertain the cause of death for 38 (5.28%) of the 720 deceased scientists. Some of these cases may have
been suicides given the cultural taboo on publicizing suicide over much of this period.

17

months notice. In practice, this “sudden” category mostly comprises fatalities due to heart
attacks, car accidents, and sudden onset illnesses. Conversely, most “anticipated” deaths are
from various forms of cancer, or other long-term illnesses. In the deceased scientist sample,
330 (46%) scientists died suddenly, while 352 (49%) died from an anticipated illness.
Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for this sample (see Appendix F for a complete
list of these individuals, along with basic demographic information, institutional affiliation,
and a brief description of their scientific domain). The overwhelming majority (91%) are
men.12 Of note is the fact that even within this sample, substantial variation in status exists:
whether one measures eminence through publications, NIH funding, or citations (excluding
those citations that accrue after the scientist has passed), the mean is always much higher
than the median.

3.3

Difference-in-Differences Estimation Framework

The death shock that provides the essential lever for our research design occurs at the
level of the individual scientist. Similarly, recognition and memorialization efforts typically
focus not on particular articles but on the overall body of work of a scientist. And yet, our
research design focuses on studying changes in citations to discrete academic publications in
the wake of their authors’ passing, rather than changes in the flow of citations aggregated
up to the scientist level of analysis.
We justify this crucial design choice as follows. Substantively, the norm of universalism
emphasized by Merton as a hallmark of the scientific incentive system assumes that the identity of a scientific producer can be unbundled from her published works, at least in principle.
The level of analysis in the first part of our study takes this distinction seriously. From
an empirical standpoint, the scientist level of analysis is not well-suited to the challenge of
identifying the causal effect of death on the reception of an academic’s work. The content
of every scientific contribution remains fixed after it is published, and only the way it is understood, celebrated, or denigrated can change over time. In contrast, the dynamics of the
flow of citations received by an individual scientist reflects both increments of recognition
accruing to past work as well as additional recognition enabled by new resources (e.g., fund12

Per our tabulations of AAMC Faculty Roster data, the patterns of entry into this labor market have
only recently equalized across genders, and our sample reflects the extreme gender imbalance that prevailed
for most of the time period we study.

18

ing, disciples, etc.) secured as a byproduct of the reception of past work. The article level
of analysis enables us to filter out the effect of the second source of variation, by anchoring
the design around a very natural datum that determines unambiguously a “before” and an
“after” period for each article: the timing of its author’s death.13
However, a simple difference between citations that accrue to a paper after, rather than
before, the time of its author’s death is not enough to yield estimates with a plausibly causal
interpretation of the effect of a scientist’s passing. This is because the memory of any article
(or scientist) must eventually fade. Examine (in Panel A of Figure 1) the mean number of
annual citations received by the 720 deceased scientists, both before and after the death.
The curve has an inverted U -shape with a peak in the year before death, followed by an
inexorable and steep decline, though it will take close to 40 years for the memory of any
work by a deceased scientist to disappear from the scientific literature. Panel B of Figure 1
produces a similar graph for the subset of still-living scientists who contribute articles to our
control group (in a manner made precise below). In this case, we use their calendar birth age
to display graphically the citation life cycle. The vertical dotted line age at 64 corresponds
to the mean age at death in the deceased sample. There too, the flow of citations declines
inexorably starting in a scientist’s late fifties, but that decline is much more gradual than
what is observed for scientists who died prematurely. Therefore, the question for our study is
not whether the recognition given to the work of deceased scientists will decrease after they
die, as it surely will. Rather, the challenge is to assess this decline relative to the citation
trajectory of articles whose recognition potential was similar at the time of the scientist’s
passing. To do so, we need to construct a control group of articles that can plausibly capture
this counterfactual.
3.3.1

Matched Sample of Articles

As in Azoulay et al. (2019), our approach is to identify control articles from the vast
set of articles authored by elite scientists who did not die prematurely. For each article by
a deceased scientist, we attempt to find at least one article by still-living scientists to pair
it with. Although this step necessarily entails some degree of judgment, in order to yield
13

This approach is not new (Farys and Wolbring 2017). For instance, Murray and Stern (2007) ask how
citations to articles shift once the underlying results appear in a patent; Azoulay et al. (2014) ask how
the receipt of an accolade changes the citation trajectories of articles that appeared before the accolade was
received; Azoulay et al. (2012) investigate how the mix of local to non-local citations changes after a scientist
moves to a geographically distant institution.

19

valid comparisons, the matching procedure must meet a number of requirements. Notably,
to contrast citation flows after the death shock, relative to before, we must be able to assign
a counterfactual date of death to each control article as well as a counterfactual eminent
scientist who could have died, but did not. Pairing treated and control articles appropriately
is therefore essential, since the control article will inherit certain characteristics from its
matched treated article.
In particular, we require that each control article (i) be published contemporaneously
with (and have a similar number of authors as) the article by a deceased scientist with which
it is paired; (ii) be unrelated (in both an intellectual and a social sense) to the treated article
with which it is paired; and (iii) have an author in last authorship position who is a stillliving elite scientist of approximately the same age as that of the deceased scientist on the
article with which it is paired. The focus on the last authorship position is a solution to the
problem that modern science is a team sport, with steadily increasing rates of coauthorship
over the past 40 years (Wuchty et al. 2007). Here, we are helped by a strong norm in
biomedical research which invariably puts the principal investigator on a research project in
last authorship position on any paper that results from the funding s/he was able to mobilize
(Nagaoka and Owan 2014).14
In addition, it is important that the control group of articles as a whole be broadly
similar to the treated group of articles, where similarity should be understood as reflecting
average balance across key covariates at baseline. Although it is impossible to identify
for each treated article a “fraternal twin” that matches it exactly on an exhaustive list of
author and article characteristics, it is possible to select article controls in a way that will
make the control group as a whole similar to the treated group in terms of expected impact
and scientific “fruitfulness” at the time of the scientist’s death. Pragmatically, we specify a
handful of covariates along which matched treated/control articles must resemble each other,
and we implement a blocking procedure—described in detail in Appendix C—to identify all
the articles among those published by still-alive scientists that satisfy these criteria (so that
each treated article can and typically does have more than one associated control article).
Since judgment is required to choose the list of “blocking” covariates, Appendix C also
14

To be sure, a scientist can have a deep imprint on a research project and yet occupy authorship position
other than last. In the case of inter-lab collaboration, for instance, it is not unusual to observe one of the
PIs occupy the first authorship position, or the next-to-last position. What is important for our purposes is
that it is difficult to imagine circumstances where an author does occupy the last author position and s/he
is not closely identified with the work.

20

provides two alternative matching schemes and probes the robustness of the core results
when selecting one of these alternatives. Reassuringly, the main conclusions are robust to
these variations. Our chosen approach yields a higher proportion of articles by deceased
scientists with at least one match within the set of articles by still-living scientists. This
has two benefits. First, the external validity of our findings is enhanced. Second, the larger
sample size gives us more statistical power to detect heterogeneous effects by type of scientist
or article.
3.3.2

Treated/Control Article Pair: An Example

Consider the paper “Isolation of ORC6. . . ” published in the journal Science in 1993
originating from the laboratory of Ira Herskowitz, an eminent UCSF geneticist who died in
2003 from pancreatic cancer. Using the procedure described in detail in Appendix C, we
match 34 publications to this article, also published in Science in 1993, and on which a stillliving star scientist occupies the last authorship position. Figure 2 illustrates the matching
with one of these articles, “Controlling Signal Transduction with Synthetic Ligands,” which
came out of the laboratory of Gerald Crabtree, a Stanford Pathologist who studied the role of
chromatin in development and disease. By the end of 2002; the Crabtree paper had garnered
214 citations, relatively close to the 218 citations that had accrued to the Li and Herskowitz
paper—both articles belong to the top percentile of the 2002 citation distribution for the
universe of papers published in 1993. Notice as well that Crabtree and Herskowitz were born
in the same year (1946), and received their highest degree in the same year (1971). This is
not happenstance, as the matching procedure requires that the career age (years since the
highest degree was earned) of the treated and control elite scientists be no more than two
years apart.
Yet there are still observable differences between this pair of articles and their authors.
The two PIs do not match particularly closely on all metrics of cumulative achievement,
for example. This is less of a concern than might appear at first blush, since as will be
described below, we have found that imposing balance on article-level characteristics yields,
as a fortunate byproduct, approximate balance on scientist-level characteristics as well.
Two additional facts about this pair of articles are worth mentioning, since they hold true
more generally in the sample. Crabtree and Herskowitz never collaborated. Furthermore,

21

these two papers belong to very different subfields of the life sciences.15 This is important
insofar as a desirable feature of the control group is to be unaffected by the treatment event.
By eliminating articles by collaborators as well as topically-related articles from the list
of eligible controls, we bolster the claim that the control articles can pin down a credible
counterfactual citation trajectory.
3.3.3

Descriptive Statistics

The procedure described above yields a total of 454,599 papers authored by 8,326 control
scientists, as well as 27,147 treated papers authored by the 720 deceased scientists.16 On
average, there are 17.7 control articles for each treated article, highlighting the “one-to-many”
feature of the matching procedure.17 Table 2 presents descriptive statistics for control and
treated publications in the baseline year, i.e., the year that immediately precedes the year of
death for the deceased scientist. A number of the covariates are balanced between treated
and control publications solely by virtue of the matching procedure—for instance, the year
the article was written and the number of authors. However, covariate balance in the level
of eminence at the time of (actual or counterfactual) death for treated and control scientists
(measured through NIH funding, number of articles published, or cumulative number of
citations) was not guaranteed by the matching procedure.
Figure 3 examines differences in the shape of the distribution for citations received by
treated and control articles, respectively, up to the baseline year. The two distributions
exhibit very similar shape, including the far left and the far right tails. As highlighted
below, balance in the stock of citations at baseline in the cross-sectional dimension of the
data is not required for the validity of the empirical exercise. More important is the absence
of differential trends in the flow of citations up until the time of treatment between the
treated and control groups. An important step of the empirical analysis will be to verify, ex
post, the absence of such trends prior to the death event.
15

Formally, the PubMed Related Citation Algorithm (which will be described in more detail below) does
not list one as being topically related to the other.
16
These 27,147 articles represent approximately 60% of the set of articles by treated scientists for which we
attempted to find matches (i.e., original articles in journals indexed by PubMed and the Web of Science, in
which the prematurely-departed scientist occupies the last position on the authorship roster, and published
no later than the year before the year of death).
17
Appendix C provides much more detail on the matching procedure, as well as two alternative matching
schemes. Our main substantive conclusions are shown to be robust across these alternatives.

3.3.4

Statistical Considerations

Our estimating equation relates the effect of a scientist’s death on citations in the following way:
h
E [citesit |Xit ] = exp β0 + β1 AF T ER DEAT Hit
+ β2 AF T ER DEAT Hit × T REATi + f (AGEit ) + δt + γi

i

(1)

where citesit is the number of citations paper i receives in year t (purged of self-citations),
AF T ER DEAT H denotes an indicator variable that switches to one in the year after the
star scientist (treated or control) associated with i passes away, T REAT is an indicator
variable set to one if the scientist dies during the period, f (AGEit ) corresponds to a set of
indicator variables for the age of article i at time t (measured as the number of years since
the year of publication), the δt ’s stand for a full set of calendar year indicator variables, and
the γi ’s correspond to article fixed effects, consistent with our approach to analyze changes
in the flow of citations within each article following the passing of an elite scientist.18
We follow Jaravel at al. (2018) in including in our specification an indicator for the timing
of death that is common to treated and control articles (whose effect will be identified by the
coefficient β1 ) in addition to the effect of interest, an interaction between AF T ER DEAT H
and T REAT (whose effect will be identified by the coefficient β2 ). The effects of these two
variables are separately identified because (i) deaths are staggered across our observation
period, and (ii) control publications inherit a counterfactual date of death since they are
uniquely associated with a treated publication through the matching procedure described
earlier and in Appendix C. The inclusion of the common term addresses the concern that
age and calendar year fixed effects may not fully account for shifts in citation activity around
the time of the scientist’s passing. If this is the case, AF T ER DEAT H will capture the corresponding transitory dynamics, while AF T ER DEAT H × T REAT will isolate the causal
effect of interest. Empirically, we find that in some specifications, the common term has
substantial explanatory power, though its inclusion does not radically alter the magnitude
of the treatment effect.
Estimation. The dependent variable of interest, citations accrued in each year (net of selfcitations), is skewed and non-negative. Specifically, 49.20% of the articles receive no citations
18

To avoid confusion, we have suppressed any subscript for the scientist. This is without loss of generality,
since each article is uniquely associated with a single scientist (i.e., there can only be one individual in
last-authorship position for each article).

23

in a given year while 0.04% accumulate over one hundred. Following a long-standing tradition in the study of scientific and technical change, we present conditional quasi-maximum
likelihood estimates based on the fixed-effect Poisson model developed by Hausman et al.
(1984). Because the Poisson model is in the linear exponential family, the coefficient estimates remain consistent as long as the mean of the dependent variable is correctly specified
(Gourieroux et al. 1984). We cluster the standard errors at the scientist level in the results
presented below.
As discussed above, we pursue two empirical goals beyond testing for the overall effect
of death on citation levels. One goal involves exploring four contextual factors. In addition
to examining how the net effect varies depending on the relative youth of the scientist, we
will examine variables associated with three broad factors: (i) a paper’s impact history; (ii)
a scientist’s engagement style; and (iii) the identity of citers.
Paper impact history. The key consideration here is that papers may vary in their
susceptibility to interested promotion based on how much impact they have made up to the
time of death (or counterfactual death). To get at this, we assign each article the percentile
of the citation distribution to which it belongs, given its vintage. When computing these
empirical distributions, we take into account both the year of death (citations that accrue
after the year of death, or counterfactual death are excluded) and the year of publication.
This allows us to compare the citation impact of each article in the sample, regardless of the
year in which it appeared and regardless of the time of treatment, relative to the article’s
age.19 Using this information, for each scientist we create five distinct article subsamples:
(1) the set of articles in the top 10% of impact at time of death; (2) the set of articles in the
bottom 10% of impact at time of death; (3) the set of articles in the second and third quartile
of the impact distribution at time of death; (4) the set of articles in the top 1% of impact
at time of death in the PubMed universe; and (5) the set of articles published in a narrow
window of three years before the time of death. Note that subsamples one through three use
a relative benchmark to delineate a set of articles (every scientist in the data has a top 10%
and a bottom 10%, for instance). The fourth subsample uses a universal benchmark, and it
is possible for scientists in the data to contribute no articles to this subsample.
19

For example, revisiting the example presented on Figure 2, Ira Herskowitz’s Science publication belongs
to the top percentile of the cumulative citation distribution for all articles published in 1993 and indexed
jointly by PubMed and the Web of Science (only citations up to 2003, the year of death, are included in the
computation); It is also ranked 10th among the 117 original articles he published before his death.

24

Engagement Style. The basic premise here is that the manner by which a scientist engages with the scientific community (prior to death) may shape how their work is recognized
(posthumously). We measure two aspects of such engagement style. The first reflects the
“gregariousness” of the scientist, as reflected in the number of coauthors or trainees with
whom he has worked. Arguably, we may expect such scientists to experience a more pronounced posthumous citation upsurge. The second reflects the scientist’s predilection for
self-promotion. One view might be that self-promotional activities while alive “prime the
pump” for the posthumous mobilization of his supporters. Conversely, it might be that
the activities of the salesman and the sales force are substitutes, for example because selfpromoters are deemed unworthy of further glorification upon passing. Our proxy for selfpromotion is a scientist’s rate of “gratuitous” self-citation, which we define as the proportion
of all citations that are self-citations where the cited paper is in a different subfield as the
citing paper (with subfields corresponding to those defined by PMRA), in the entire portfolio
of publications for a scientist in the pre-death period.20
Citer identity. In order to better understand the activities of the “sales force,” characterizing the relationship between the citing authors and the cited is of interest. Specifically, are
posthumous citations more likely to come from former collaborators or trainees? Are they
more likely to originate from within the narrow subfield of the cited article, or from outside
that narrow subfield? Or are they more likely to be circumscribed in geographic space, for
example emerging from authors employed by the same institution as that of the deceased
scientist? We parse all the citing-to-cited article pairs to distinguish between such relationships in social space, intellectual space, and geographic space.21 We then aggregate these
data up to the article-year level to compute citation counts from related versus unrelated
authors.
20
We experimented with several variants of this measure, including defining self-promotion as the proportion of gratuitous self-cites, as opposed to the proportion of all cites. The results presented below were
qualitatively unchanged.
21
Briefly, matching each author on citing and cited articles with the Faculty Roster of the Association of
American Medical Colleges (AAMC) allows us to distinguish between publications with and without former
collaborators or trainees, and with or without authors colocated with the focal elite scientist. Similarly, the
use of the PubMed Related Citation Algorithm (PMRA) helps us distinguish between citations coming from
within the same subfield, as opposed to outside the subfield. Importantly, this parsing can be implemented
for the articles authored by both the treated and the placebo scientists, in a rigorously symmetric fashion.
Finally, we distinguish between geographically proximate vs. distant citers using authors’ institutional
affiliation obtained from the AAMC Faculty Roster and NIH’s CGAF database.

3.4

Measuring Individual Recognition in Science

To recall, the second step of our empirical analysis involves comparing recognition activity
for deceased versus still-living scientists. Our approach leverages the observation that there
exist institutionalized occasions, over the course of a scientist’s career, whereby her body of
work is recognized in a positive way. Perhaps most prominent among these include memorial
events and obituaries written after death, and festschrifts or career awards (such as induction
into the National Academy of Science or receipt of the Nobel Prize or Lasker Award) prior to
death. In addition, professional journals routinely interview scholars to provide a perspective
on the evolution of their fields, or publish retrospective articles. The common thread across
these “recognition events” is that they celebrate the scholar as an individual producer rather
than narrowly shine a light on individual articles.22 Importantly, the rate of arrival of these
events (if they occur at all) is not exogenous, but rather reflects an investment on the part of
fellow scientists. A cynic could be forgiven for thinking (probably not out loud) that many
such events would go unrecorded unless they served the memorializers’ interest, in addition
to the lofty and well-intentioned goal of enhancing or preserving the legacy or career of the
individual being recognized.
Accordingly, we undertake a large-scale effort to collect articles recorded in academic
journals that celebrate, recognize, or memorialize the scientists in our sample, whether they
are deceased or still-living. The challenge is to do so in a manner this consistent over time
and does not entail a built-in bias in favor of the deceased. To do so, we rely on PubMed, a
publicly available bibliometric database curated by the Library of Medicine, which contains,
as of the end of 2018, 29 million records for the biomedical research literature, life science
journals, and online books. Helpfully, every publication indexed by PubMed is tagged by
one or more of 80 distinct publication types, ten among which could potentially denote
a personal recognition event. Sifting through these articles in a systematic way, we build
a dataset of 5,850 distinct articles that pertain to one of the scientists in our database,
deceased or still-living control.23 While there are more events overall in the control sample,
22
Consider, for example, “Studying the visual system in awake monkeys: two classic papers by Robert H.
Wurtz,” which appeared in the Journal of Neurophysiology in 2007. While the article highlights the impact
of two articles in a specific subfield, it does so with a clear focus on the context that lead the investigator
to develop a novel experimental paradigm to study visual perception in primates, and features his picture
prominently.
23
Appendix E provides additional detail on the identification of these events which involved a manual
handcoding effort to weed out false positives due to homonyms.

26

the average number of events per scientist is much higher for the deceased than for the still
living scientists (1.74 vs. 0.52 on average).
In order to compare the intensity of recognition between prematurely deceased and stillliving scientists, we leverage our research design. Recall that a byproduct of the matching
procedure at the article level (cf. Appendix C) is to generate a counterfactual year of death
for each elite scientist whose articles match those of treated scientists. This counterfactual
year of death provides a temporal anchor to compare recognition for the deceased as well as
the living. A slight complication arises since the same scientist can serve as control multiple
times, for different treated scientists who passed away in different years between 1969 and
2003. As a result, there is typically more than one counterfactual year of death for each
control scientist. To get around this problem, we simply select at random one of the possible
counterfactual years of death for each living scientist. We then use a window of one year
before until four years after the year of death (or counterfactual death) symmetrically for
deceased and control scientists, and sum the number of recognition events for each scientist
within that window.
Figure 5, Panel A displays the histogram for the distribution of events, broken down
by treatment status. The distribution of recognition is extremely skewed for deceased and
still-living scientists, but recognition is a relatively rare event for the 8,326 control scientists:
Only 6% are recognized at least once, whereas 49% of the deceased are the subject of a
recognition event. This simple comparison of means provides important validation for a key
premise of our argument, which is that death is an exogenous shock that shifts opportunities
for interested promotion.24

3.5

Predicting Long-Run Posthumous Citations

The third and last step of our analysis examines whether recognition efforts plausibly lie
on the causal pathway linking the premature death of a scientist with her citation “afterlife.”
To do so, we face the challenge that posthumous citations could be mechanically related to
24

Given the sparsity of the recognition data—a vanishingly small number of still-living controls receive
more than one event during the window—our empirical analysis at the scientist level will focus on the
probability of being recognized (modeled with a logit specification), rather than the intensity of recognition.
In Appendix E, we present additional analyses of memorialization specifically for the sample of 720 scientists.
In this smaller sample, there are enough events (especially after bringing in additional types of memorial
events beyond those appearing in professional journals) to model the intensity of memorialization using count
data models.

27

memorialization activities (e.g., the publication of a special volume dedicated to the work
of the deceased, which necessarily includes citations to his work), and more broadly to
the activities of the deceased’s “sales force.” To avoid the reflection problem entailed by
correlating two variables driven by the same underlying process—the mobilization of the
sales force—we must predict posthumous citation using information available before the
death event exclusively.
A natural starting point might be to use the estimates from the causal model to generate
predictions. However, the difference-in-differences modeling strategy described in section
3.3.4, while well-suited to the challenge of estimating the causal effect of premature death on
citation trajectories, is not adapted to the task of predicting, at the article level, the future
time path of citations.25 To generate article-level predictions, we begin by collapsing the
data in the longitudinal dimension, such that for each article (treated or control) there are
exactly two observations, one before the year of death or counterfactual death, and one from
the year of death onwards.
We then construct a list of 728 predictive features, including the number of citations that
accrued to the article in the pre-death (or pre-counterfactual death) period (log transformed);
a female scientist indicator variable; year of publication effects; type of degree effects; a
full suite of indicator variables for the scientists’ year of (possibly counterfactual) death; a
series of indicator variables for scientists’ highest degree graduation years; and 472 indicator
variables for each journal in which each article appeared. Using these features, we perform
a penalized Poisson regression with Lasso regularization to generate predicted post-death
citation rates without overfitting the data.26
For each article, we compute the number of “excess” citations, that is, the difference
between actual posthumous citations received and the predicted score. Panel B of Figure D1
in Appendix D displays the histogram for the distribution of this measure, which is skewed
and takes on negative values (the median of the distribution is -4.6). In the article-level
25

In fact, the conditional fixed effects Poisson estimator only allows us to characterize how scientist death
shifts the conditional mean of the flow of citation over time. It would be invalid to use the resulting estimates
to compute a prediction for each article in the sample. Yet, it is the appropriate estimator for the causal
analysis because it will generate consistent estimates under mild regularity assumptions (Wooldridge 1997).
26
Appendix D provides more details, as well as sensitivity analyses, using a much more parsimonious
negative binomial model estimated by maximum likelihood, as well as a high-dimensional fixed effects Poisson
estimation routine (Correia et al. 2019). The variant we selected, based on the plugin formula for the Lasso
(Belloni et al. 2016), generate by far the best out-of sample predictions (as ascertained by the deviance
residuals), but interestingly exhibits the smallest correlation with actual posthumous citations.

28

sample of extinct scientists, we can run simple OLS specifications where excess citations are
regressed on an indicator variable for having a deceased last author, a non-linear function of
the intensity of recognition activities for each scientist, as well as a large vector X of control
variables (such as year of publication effects for each article, gender, highest degree, cause
of death, age at death, and year of death indicators):

where N egLog(x) = log(x) if x > 0 and −log(−x) if x < 0 (Yeo and Johnson 2000). We are
primarily interested in examining whether the correlation between death and posthumous
citations is mediated by recognition efforts. If this were the case, the coefficient β1 should
decrease in magnitude, or even vanish once the intensity of recognition is controlled for in
the specification (by including the series of indicator variables γk , corresponding to three
different levels of recognition intensity, as right hand side covariates).

Results

4.1

The Effect of Premature Death on Citation Rates

Table 3 presents the main results for the first step of our analysis, and Figure 4 provides corresponding event study graphs. These are created by estimating a specification in
which the treatment effect is interacted with a set of indicator variables corresponding to a
particular year relative to the scientist’s death, and then graphing the effects and the 95%
confidence interval around them (for example, panels A, B, and C of Figure 4 correspond to
the first, second, and third column in Table 3).27 The estimate in the first column of Table 3
implies that the papers by deceased scientists receive a boost in citations after the scientist
passes away, relative to the papers of still-living scientists, with an estimated magnitude of
7.4%. Panel A in Figure 4 shows that this effect is long-lasting. After a pronounced upsurge
in citation rates in the three to four years that immediately follow the death event, the
magnitude of the effect tends to attenuate, and is less precisely estimated, though only in
Panel C (corresponding to older stars) is there clear evidence of reversion to the pre-event
mean of zero effect. Overall, it seems that however important a scientist is as the “salesman”
27

In these specifications, the AF T ER DEAT H term which is common to treated and control publications
is also interacted with a complete series of lags and leads relative to the year of death or counterfactual death.

29

for promoting his work, this pales in comparison to the promotional effect of the third-party
“sales force.” More generally, we have clear evidence of a distortion in the informational
efficiency of the scientific valuation process, whereby the death of a scientist seems to raise
the valuation of a scientific paper by dint of the contingency of its lead author’s untimely
demise.
The additional results in Table 3 and Figure 4 shed light on two issues discussed above:
(i) whether the death was anticipated, and how such anticipation might alter the strength
of our conclusions; and (ii) whether the effect is more pronounced when the death occurred
at a young age.
With regard to the first issue, it seems clear from Panels A, B, C, and E of Figure 4 that
there is no discernible evidence of an effect in the years leading up to the death. The absence
of differential citation trends between treated and control articles provide an important ex
post validation of our identification strategy. In Panel D (corresponding to the subsample of
articles by treated scientists who died from an anticipated illness and their associated control
articles), one can observe a positive and marginally significant increase in citations in the
year before death. It seems that for anticipated deaths, news of the scientist’s terminal illness
increases attention to the scientist’s work prior to their passing, especially if the news of the
eminent scientist’s illness spreads in the “invisible college” in which s/he participates.28
With regard to the second issue, we find that the citation boost that a scientist receives
as a result of premature death is greater when the death occurs at a relatively young age.
The overall difference can be seen most clearly from the comparison of Panels B and C, given
the stronger tendency towards reversion in later years among scientists who were older at
the time of death. The overall difference is relatively slight, however, and is only statistically
significant when the comparison is within scientists who die suddenly (whereas the difference
is reversed when the comparison is within scientists whose deaths were anticipated). This
could be because such deaths are experienced by the community as especially tragic (with
particular sensitivity to the work the scientist might have produced had she lived), thereby
triggering an especially strong mobilization on the part of the sales force.
We now explore the underlying mechanisms through the three contextual factors discussed above: article impact at baseline, scientist engagement style, and citer identity.
28

Note however that anticipated deaths do not exhibit elevated rates of “recognition events” in the year
of their death—or the two years that precede it—relative to scientists whose death was likely sudden.

30

Table 4 splits the sample over article-level characteristics that should correlate with the
salience of discrete academic works within a larger portfolio of published articles for each
scientist. The average effect (reproduced in the first column) conceals striking heterogeneity
in the magnitude that apply to articles of different initial impact, assessed by cumulative
citations received up the year of death (or counterfactual death). For the articles that had
already attracted the most notice at the time of death, either in a local (Own Top 10%)
or global (Universe Top 1%) sense, the posthumous increase in citations is more than 17%
(fourth and fifth columns), while for the least well-cited articles at the time of death (Own
Bottom 10%), the boost is an even more remarkable 91% (second column). The papers
that lie between the 25% and 75% percentile of citation impact at the time of death (third
column) do not experience a posthumous citation boost. Finally, recently published articles,
who are presumably salient in citers’ minds, experience a somewhat greater increase (10.1%)
than articles published earlier. These analyses imply that the increased attention received
by the articles of deceased scientists after their passing is not uniformly distributed across
their portfolio: the broad middle of the impact distribution receives no citation boost, while
articles in the tail, and particularly the bottom tail, experience an upward shift in their
citation trajectory. These contributions would have remained relatively obscure had their
last author not prematurely died.
Table 5 reports the results with regard to engagement style. The first two columns report
estimates for the sample split across the median of the “size of the sales force” distribution,
and shows that the post-death effect is driven by the sample of stars who cultivated a larger
number of coauthors while alive. The next two columns correspond to a sample split across
the median of our proxy for self-promotional behavior. We find that the post-death citation
boost is twice as large in magnitude for the subsample of articles of more “humble” stars,
consistent with the view that the salesman’s promotional activities are discounted by the
audience. However, we caution that the standard errors around the estimates are sufficiently
large that we cannot reject the hypothesis that the two coefficients are in fact equal.
The results with regard to citer identity are presented in Table 6. Note that the different
columns do not correspond to splits of the sample; rather, it is only the dependent variable
that changes across specifications. For instance, the first column models the effect of the
scientist’s passing on the number of citations solely coming from articles that do not include
a former collaborator of the deceased (or of the still-living control scientist). Overall, there
is only modest evidence that post-death citations are bestowed on the work of deceased

31

scientists disproportionately by more proximate citers. While the magnitudes are higher
for proximate citations (especially in the intellectual and spatial dimensions), the difference
between the effect on proximate vs. non-proximate citations is not itself statistically significant. We tentatively conclude that the citation boost documented in Tables 3 and 4 (as well
as Figure 4) reflects a diffuse and increased interest in the deceased’s contributions.

4.2

The Determinants of Individual Academic Recognition

In clear violation of informational inefficiency, the results above demonstrate that the
reception of scientists’ work does change after their death, with articles by the deceased
being shifted to a steeper citation trajectory, relative to the articles of the living. This
posthumous boost is particularly large for articles that had not attracted wide recognition,
and for young scientists who die suddenly. As a whole, the evidence suggests that death
elicits a surge in interest in the deceased scientist’s work relative to comparable work by
still-living scientists.
What these results do not explain, however, is why this mobilization occurred. In the
second and third steps of our analysis, we examine the possibility that supporters of the
deceased scientist promote her work via recognition events whereas such interested promotion
does not occur, or occurs with less intensity, for still-living scientists.
To measure the determinants of academic recognition at the scientist level, we model
the probability of being memorialized (for the deceased) or recognized (for the still-living
controls) at least once in an academic journal within a window of one year before to four
years after the year of death (or counterfactual death). In the sample of 9;046 scientists,
our minimal list of covariates to explain recognition includes an indicator variable for the
deceased, the scientist’s gender, his age in the year of death (captured with six indicator
variables corresponding to different brackets, e.g., less than 45 years old, between 45 and 55
years old, etc.), indicator variables for the cause of death (anticipated death is the omitted
category), and a full suite of indicator variables for the calendar year of death.29
Table 7 reports marginal effects from logit models. Consistent with Figure 5, Panel A,
the estimates in column 1 demonstrate that the deceased are more than 18% more likely to
29

Recall that still-living scientists inherit both the year of death and the cause of death of the deceased
scientist with whom they are matched in our research design.

32

be recognized (at the means of the other covariates). Conversely, there does not seem to
be much difference between the likelihood of recognition for scientists of different genders
(with the caveat that the gender composition of the sample skews heavily male). We do
not report the coefficients for the included age effects, but the age gradient is relatively flat,
except at very old ages—the “forces of nature” who die past the age of 75 while still leading
an active scientific career get memorialized more intensely than scientists whose death can
more legitimately be deemed “premature.”
Columns 2, 3, and 4 examine the role of eminence in shaping the intensity of recognition.
All columns include an indicator variable for members of the National Academy of Science,
which can be thought of as an “elite within the elite.” The effect of NAS membership is
always large and precisely estimated.30 Column 2 uses cumulative citations at death as an
additional measure of eminence. Column 3 (respectively column 4) uses cumulative publications instead (respectively cumulative NIH funding). The results indicate that eminence is,
perhaps unsurprisingly, correlated positively with recognition. Column 5 includes all three
measures in the specification, but the high correlation between them makes it difficult to
interpret the results (although the cumulative citation measure is the one that appears to
keep its sign and magnitude).
The next two columns retain eminence as a covariate (using NAS membership and citations at death), but also add two measures that aim to capture the size of the cohort
of scientists who are probably most affected by the premature death of a scientist: former
trainees and collaborators of the deceased.31 The results in columns 6 and 7 do not seem to
indicate that the sheer quantity of trainees and former collaborators (which we might think
of as constituting the deceased’s “visible college”) correlate strongly with memorialization
activities. Column 8 presents the results for the most saturated model, which adds our
index of self-promotional behavior as a covariate. We find that self-promotion is positively
correlated with recognition. At the very least, it does not appear that humility makes it
easier for the sales force to coalesce around the memory of the deceased.
Since the post-death citation boost was especially startling for younger scientists, we also
explore whether the age-recognition gradient differs for deceased and still-living scientists.
30

Table E5 in Appendix E reproduces this effect while omitting the NAS Biographical Memoirs in the count
of academic memory events, since this could mechanically lead to a correlation between NAS membership
and memorialization. The results are largely unchanged.
31
Trainees are identified as the subset of coauthors who appear in first authorship position when the star
is in last authorship position, in a window of five years around the time they earned their highest degree.

33

We do so by including age at death×treatment status interactions in the memorialization
regression model, and displaying the marginal effects in Figure 5, Panel B. Older scientists
may be more memorialized than younger ones on average (cf. Figure E2 in Appendix E),
but at every age, and especially younger ones, scientists who die get memorialized more than
those who remain alive. Thus, consistent with Lang and Lang (1988), and consistent with
the findings of the difference-in-differences model, the type of recognition events that accrue
to very senior scientists in the twilight of their careers (or in retirement) are bestowed onto
younger scientists only if they die prematurely.
Appendix E, Table E3 examines the authors of academic memory events in the subsample of 720 deceased scientists, and demonstrates that the memorializers are either socially
connected (coauthor or former trainee), intellectually connected (same subfield), or spatially
connected (same institution) with the individual they recognize. The evidence is therefore
consistent with a particular sequence unfolding after the death event whereby close associates
take on the burden of memorializing the deceased, and in certain conditions this triggers a
much wider and diffuse response that expresses itself in the form of an elevated propensity
to cite the work of the deceased. The next section attempts to substantiate empirically the
last step of this sequence.

4.3

Long-run Citation Afterlife and its Relationship to Recognition Efforts

For the final step of our analysis, we test whether recognition events in a limited window
around the time of death (or counterfactual death) mediate the effect of a scientist’s passing
on the rate of long-run posthumous citations for articles that were published before the death
occurred. To do so, we regress “excess” cumulative citations (computed in Section 3.5 and
Appendix D) on an indicator variable for the deceased, the intensity of recognition activity,
along with the following covariates as controls: year of publication effects, gender, degree
type, an indicator variable for sudden deaths and unknown causes of death, as well as a full
set of indicator variables for the scientist’s age at the time of death and for his/her calendar
year of death. Because recognition efforts might have a non-linear relationship with long-run
citations, we break out the overall count of academic recognition events: zero event (89.2%
of the articles, the omitted category); exactly one recognition event (6.9% of the articles);
exactly two recognition events (2.1% of the articles); and three or more recognition events
(1.8% of the articles).
34

Table 8 reports OLS estimates. Because the distribution of excess citations is skewed
and takes on negative values (see Figure D1, Panel B in Appendix D), we model it using
a NegLog transformation (Yeo and Johnson 2000). In columns 1a, 1b, and 1c, we use all
possible citations to build a predicted count for the “surprise” in citations for each article
published by a scientist in the post-death period. In columns 2a, 2b, and 2c, we use the
same predictive model but omit citations that accrue in the five years that immediately
follow the death (as well as citations from articles written by coauthors or memorializers) to
compute the prediction. The reason to exclude citations that accrue to the scientists’ articles
in the immediate aftermath of his/her death (or counterfactual death) is that these citations
could reflect, at least in part, recognition efforts (it is not uncommon for obituaries and
reminiscences published in scientific journals to have a list of references, for example). By
excluding from the count of excess citations those that accrue in the period of bereavement (or
counterfactual bereavement), we can be more confident that our measure of excess citations
does not reflect the mechanical impact of memorialization efforts.
In column 1a, we confirm the effect found in the difference-in-differences analysis: the
articles of deceased scientists receive 11.2% more posthumous citations on average, relative
to those of still-living scientists. Results in column 1b are consistent with our argument
that assigns a key role to recognition events: recognized scientists exhibit elevated rates of
posthumous citations, relative to unrecognized ones. Column 1c simultaneously enters the
deceased effect and the effects for the recognition events in the model. The magnitude of the
deceased effect is halved, and becomes imprecisely estimated. In contrast, the magnitudes of
the recognition effects remain largely unchanged. From this analysis, it would appear that
recognition processes largely mediate the effect of death on the allocation of the scientific
community’s attention towards scientific works that appeared before the death.32
The models in columns 2a, 2b, and 2c paint a similar qualitative picture, with the caveat
that the attenuation of the coefficient estimate for the effect of death itself is less stark in
these models, which omit the short-run citation response.33 In spite of this, the correlation
between recognition intensity and posthumous citations does not appear to merely reflect
32

Using a more parsimonious model with a single dichotomous mediator (recognized at least once versus
not), we perform a Sobel (Sobel 1982) test and find that 41.1% of the effect of death is mediated by the
recognition effect.
33
The Sobel Test implies that only 37.3% of the treatment effect of death is mediated by the recognition
effect in this case.

35

awareness by the “visible college” during the turbulent years that immediately follow the
passing of these scientists.
A necessary caveat is that the validity of a mediation analysis of this type requires (i)
the absence of unmeasured treatment-outcome confounders, conditional on control covariates; and (ii) the absence of unmeasured mediator-outcome confounders, also conditional
on covariates (Shaver 2005). The first assumption might be valid in our application, if we
assume death to be an exogenous event.34 The second assumption strikes us as being less
tenable, since more recognized scientists might differ from less recognized ones in myriad
other ways that also correlate with unobserved determinants of posthumous citation rates.
In the absence of exogenous variation in memorialization intensity, the evidence of partial
mediation presented in Table 8 must therefore be considered as merely suggestive: individual recognition plausibly contributes to the triggering of a vibrant “citation afterlife” for
deceased scientists.
When considered in the context of the results presented in Tables 3 through 7, the
evidence points to the following chain of events: the death of eminent scientists activates a
narrow vanguard of colleagues who were proximate to the deceased.35 It is this vanguard
who engages in memorialization efforts, and these efforts in turn bring to the attention of
the scientific community at large the work of the deceased—in particular, work that may
have been overlooked while s/he was alive.

Conclusion and Discussion

5.1

Limitations

Before concluding, it is useful to consider our findings in light of the two principal limitations of our study: that our sample is limited to elite academic life scientists, and that
our method for identifying the effect of interested promotion focuses on the shock of a scientist’s premature death. To recall, the main advantage of our sample is that the wealth of
34

But even the exogenous character of death is open to challenge in our setting: in the case of anticipated
events, elite scientists might have the opportunity to actively shape their legacy, including the identity of
their future memorializers.
35
Proximity is multidimensional, corresponding to relationships that unfolded in geographic space (such
as the case of department or university colleagues), in social space (such as between mentor and trainee, or
between coauthors), and in intellectual space (such as shared topics, research questions, and methodologies).

36

information on elite life scientists allows us to create precise and meaningful counterfactuals.
And the main advantage of focusing on the effects of death is that the death of a scientist
occasions a shift in promotional activity without any change in the underlying quality of
what was produced. But to what extent do our findings generalize beyond what we can
observe with this sample and method?
Regarding the limitations of focusing on elite scientists, some light may be shed by examining the variation in status within our sample. To see if higher status scientists receive
a larger boost in citations after their death, we reprise the difference-in-differences empirical
framework presented in Section 3.3 and split the sample at the median by cumulative publications, citations, and funding at the time of death. No clear pattern emerges from these
analyses—displayed in Table 9—except that the effect of death remains positive across all
sample splits. The articles of more eminent scientists may experience a larger boost than
those of the less eminent (when eminence is measured by cumulative publications at death)
or a smaller boost (when eminence is measure by cumulative citations or funding at death).
Moreover, in all cases the difference between the above median and below median coefficients
is not itself statistically significant. Therefore, the data at our disposal do not support the
idea that the efficacy of interested promotion varies with a scientist’s status.
Yet there remain reasons to doubt that we can generalize from an elite sample to the
general population of scientists. On the one hand, it is possible that interested promotion is
more efficacious for lower-status scientists. This possibility is foreshadowed by the literature
on the Matthew Effect in that it highlights how the work of high-status scientists is more
widely read (Merton 1968; Azoulay et al. 2014; Simcoe and Waguespack 2011; Cole 1970;
Allison et al. 1982). Insofar as this is the case, it may be that the work of elite scientists
is relatively insensitive to promotional efforts in general and posthumous memorialization
in particular. Put differently, while we find that even the highest-status scientists have
some work that has been overlooked by the community and is thus sensitive to interested
promotion, this should a fortiori be true for low-status scientists. But while the efficacy of
equivalent promotional activity may be greater for lower-status scientists, it may be more
difficult to mobilize such (posthumous) activity for such scientists. Our results regarding
the correlates of individual academic recognition (Table 7 and Table E4 in Appendix E)
demonstrate significant responsiveness to status differences. Since such efforts partly mediate
the effect of death on posthumous citations (Table 8), it follows that one might expect the
death of lower-status scientists to be less effective in mobilizing a sales force, and for this

37

smaller sales force to be less effective in activating the community at large to pay homage
to the work of the deceased.36 Finally, it is also possible that interested promotion would be
less valuable for lower-status scientists because audiences will find efforts to promote their
work less credible.
Putting aside how the rate and effect of interested promotion might vary with the status
of the scientist, promotional activities may vary with other contextual factors that are held
constant in our study. In particular, it may be that the death of a scientist is an unusually
good context for promoting her work because the norm of disinterestedness is suspended.
The occasion of a death may also lend unusual credibility to assessments of a scientist’s
work because they occur sometime after publication and thus are not a snap judgment but
can be made in light of subsequent work. Finally, since we identified the salesman effect
indirectly, via the absence of a drop in citations due to death, there is reason to wonder
whether scientists can sometimes be more effective as salesmen than our study suggests.
The upshot is that the current study is hardly the last word on how interested promotion
skews scientific valuation or social valuation more generally. Our results provide evidence
for informational inefficiency in a highly developed and broad scientific domain, but they
are particular to that domain and a particular select group within it, a particular social cue,
and a particular opportunity for viewing the effects of that social cue. Our discussion here
provides some guidance for how our results may generalize along those dimensions, but we
must await future research before drawing firmer conclusions.

5.2

Implications

The foregoing caveats notwithstanding, our study has significant implications for understanding the informational (in)efficiency of meritocratic systems, how science as a vocation
shapes recognition and the allocation of credit, and for reputational entrepreneurship more
generally. We conclude by discussing each of these implications in turn.
36

The literature on the Matthew Effect would also suggest that lower-status scientists attract smaller
numbers of coauthors, research assistants, doctoral students, and admirers (see Zuckerman 1967; Dey et al.
1997; Goldstone 1979; Stewart 1983; Rossiter 1993; Allison and Stewart 1974), in other words, a less vibrant
sales force.

5.2.1

The Informational Efficiency of Meritocratic Systems

An important contribution of our paper is to open up a new direction for the study of
how social cues impact the informational efficiency of meritocratic systems. As reviewed
above, recent research has made significant strides on this question. However, this literature
is also limited because of the narrow range of social cues and situations it has examined. In
short, it is potentially quite problematic to reduce all social cues to disinterested validation.
One important limitation of this restricted focus has been stressed by some scholars (see
Zuckerman 2012a: 227-230; Turco and Zuckerman 2017: 1287) but not fully appreciated in
the literature—i.e., that anonymous evaluators (as in Salganik et al. 2006 or van de Rijt
2019) are unusually impervious to social influence. In many social settings, actors are highly
sensitive to the popularity of a practice or product, sometimes conforming and sometimes
differentiating from others based purely on the prevalence and identity of others who have
adopted it (e.g., Catalini and Tucker 2017; Lieberson and Lynn 2003; Obukhova et al. 2014).
As such, whereas some scholars have concluded from studies of anonymous evaluators that
social cues have limited impact in skewing valuations in meritocratic settings (see Salganik
and Watts 2008; Bol et al. 2017), this conclusion is premature.
To be sure, some studies have indeed examined disinterested validation in settings where
valuations are not anonymous. For example, studies based on natural experiments in scientific domains are focused on environments where the evaluators may be quite sensitive
to the impressions their evaluations make on others. In particular, scientists may often be
reluctant to cite work that is rarely cited by others (or perhaps by lower-status scientists).
Given that, it is notable progress to find that disinterested validation is responsible for a
significant if modest degree of informational inefficiency (Azoulay et al. 2014; Simcoe and
Waguespack 2011).37
Yet without broadening the social cues examined, from disinterested validation to interested promotion, our knowledge of how social cues impact informational efficiency is quite
limited. It is unclear why (with the exception of the literature on reputational entrepreneurship), scholars have focused on disinterested validation rather than interested promotion.38
37

Note, however, that when evaluators are highly sensitive to making unusual valuations, this provides
another reason why a system can be allocationally inefficient even while achieving informational efficiency.
At the limit, if everyone conforms to established views, reactions to new work will be consistent but progress
will never be recognized.
38
As Arnout van de Rijt helpfully pointed out to us, an additional dimension along which social cues
vary is the extent to which they occur via relationships. Thus the mode of social influence found in book

39

One possibility is that it is challenging to study promotional activity in the laboratory, at
least in a manner that would be generalizable. A second possibility is that scholars tend to
assume that scientific fields, and meritocratic systems more generally, are governed by the
Mertonian norms of disinterestedness and universalism. We have given ample reason not to
rely on such an assumption, however. In light of the information frictions documented here
and prior research, scientific communities may find it difficult and undesirable to dismiss
promotional efforts as they may have useful information in them. This ambiguity may make
interested promotion an effective means of boosting valuations, both by the focal scientist,
and by her supporters.
If either the avowed norms of science were fully operative or the mechanisms underlying
the scientific marketplace worked to distinguish better from worse work (given established
paradigms), it would not matter whether the author of a scientific paper is dead or alive.
But we find that it does matter, thus indicating the weakness of such norms and the limits
to informational efficiency. In particular, the random event of an untimely death elicits
commemoration activity, and such activity seems to raise the valuation of elite scientists’
lesser known work. As noted, these findings are hardly definitive. But insofar as we have
identified a class of important social cues that shape valuations in meritocratic systems,
future work will help flesh out our understanding of such effects given a wider range of social
cues and social contexts.
5.2.2

How Science as a Vocation Shapes Recognition and the Allocation of
Credit

A second contribution of our paper is to shed light on how careers within science shape the
allocation of credit. Misvaluations arise in part because science struggles to divorce research
from the identity of its author. The norms of disinterestedness and universalism belie the
fact that science is a profession through which many individuals seek employment, status,
and remuneration (Merton 1968; Polanyi 1966; Gieryn 1983).While scientific communities
may seek to evaluate contributions in a manner that is blind to the identity of contributors,
members can hardly be blind to identity when they recruit individuals to teach and to
manage laboratories. Similarly, while citations and various awards may be conferred on
clubs (Rawlings and Childress 2019) is distinct from either that which occurs via the canonical studies of
disinterested validation or the kind of interested promotion we have presented studied in this article—both
of which operate largely outside direct relationships. A full account of how social cues skew valuations should
also consider this additional dimension.

40

papers, grants and other awards are given to individuals for broad research agendas. The
paradox is that the scientific community is committed to assessing work independently of
their producers even while evaluating producers on the basis of their work. This tension
between universalism and science as an employment system is most observable in the debate
over the “blinding” of the review process; though double-blinded reviews are most common
in science, there is significant controversy over the practice precisely because some explicitly
wish to use the author’s identity as a signal of quality (Blank 1991; Ceci and Peters 1984).
While the salience of identity to the valuation of scientific work is not new in the context
of this debate, we demonstrate that even outside of it (or more specifically, after it), the
identity of the author materially affects the valuation of scientific work.
This struggle shows science to be nearer to art in its evaluation of work than would
at first appear. There is little debate that the value of a work of art is greatly affected
by the identity of the artist. The salience of the artist’s identity arises from the fact that
art is assessed through the lens of the artist’s style (Sgourev and Althuizen 2014; Wohl
Forthcoming). For this reason, art exhibitions are typically organized by artist (within
genre) and reviews are most often done by well-known critics where the identity of both
parties is plainly visible. Science at first blush seems to be organized in stark contrast, all in
accordance to the norm of universalism (Merton 1979). But our findings demonstrate that
these institutional arrangements are insufficient to overcome the incentives created by the
employment and status system of science. Just as in the case of Lang and Lang’s (1988)
etchers, the valuation of scientific works is affected by the identity of the author via efforts
at interested promotion. Discussions of a scientist’s oeuvre at a retirement festschrift or a
memorial event bear many of the hallmarks of parallel events in the art world.
5.2.3

The Logic of Interested Promotion

Finally, our analysis advances our understanding of how interested promotion shapes
producer legacies. Past research in this area (labelled “reputational entrepreneurship”) has
focused on politics and art (Fine 1996; Jansen 2007; Lang and Lang 1988; Bromberg and
Fine 2002; Kahl et al. 2010; McCormick 2015). This study used the context of science to
analyze how a scientist’s death affects the amount of interested promotion that her work
receives, thus boosting positive recognition for her papers. This represents an advance both
because this is a setting with especially strong meritocratic norms and because it allows for
more careful identification. A key challenge in verifying any causal claim is to measure the

41

impact relative to a counterfactual situation in which the event had not occurred (Lewis
1973). In politics, this is daunting because the number of observations is quite small and
events are historically and contextually dependent. And identifying counterfactuals in art is
challenging due to the absence of consensual criteria for judging pieces of art to be equivalent.
In science, however, over 2.5 million articles are published annually after having completed
peer review based on relatively consensual evaluation guidelines. As a result, we have been
able to synthesize counterfactual cases in which death and/or interested promotion did not
occur by comparing articles with similar characteristics.
This approach yields striking results: interested promotion can permanently shift the
valuation of prior work by up to 7.3% on average, and upwards of 90% in some cases. This
research design also allows us to shed light on which actors are the most effective in promoting
legacy. Prior work tended to focus on either the sales force (Lang and Lang 1988) or the
salesman (e.g., Fine 1996) but tended not to directly compare the two. Our research design
allows for this through the juxtaposition of living scientists and the memorializers of deceased
ones. This comparison reveals the memorializers (“sales force”) to be more effective in
changing valuations than is the scientist herself. This may reflect a very general pattern. It is
intriguing to note how major religious movements (e.g., Christianity, Mormonism, Hasidism,
Islam, and Buddhism) seem to get a boost from the founder’s death, as it mobilizes efforts by
disciples to ensure that the founder’s life and vision are remembered and institutionalized.39
But why might the sales force be more effective than the salesman? Two likely (but as yet
untested) reasons are size and credibility. Individuals promoting their own work may be
limited in that they can only be in one place at a time; by contrast, the sales force can
have a much larger presence. Additionally, while communities may discount the efforts of
the salesman as being self-interested, the motives of the sales force may be more difficult
to impugn. As such, the larger community may be more receptive to their message, and
therefore, likely to pay more attention.
5.2.4

The Impact of Superstar Scientist Deaths

Our paper also sheds some initial light on how interested promotion works. Prior research
on reputational entrepreneurship does not distinguish between shifts in attention and in
valuation. By contrast, our results—in particular, that it is the least-cited papers that are
most sensitive to reputational entrepreneurship—suggest that attentional processes may be
39

We are grateful to Angela Lu for pointing this out to us.

42

especially important. Our study is not definitive in this regard, nor is it clear to what extent
they would generalize to domains beyond science, but they call into question a tendency to
assume that reputational entrepreneurship operates by changing the valuations of existing
audiences. In bringing overlooked work to the fore, the sales force is able to increase its
valuation by changing the sample of work with which the community engages (Denrell and
Le Mens 2016). That this mechanism is so effective in science, and especially in the work
of elite scientists, is testimony to the extent to which search costs inhibit the scientific
community’s ability to digest new work.
We close by reflecting on how our findings at once resonate and are in tension with broader
observations concerning the role of a prominent scientist’s death in shaping her legacy. On
the one hand, we have seen evidence of a general pattern by which death mobilizes (a large,
credible cadre) of supporters to promote the scientist’s legacy. On the other hand, recent
research (Azoulay et al. 2019) provides systematic evidence for Max Planck’s quip that
“science advances one funeral at a time.” The idea is that prominent scientists are often
conservative forces due to their control of resources and opportunities, such that their removal
from the scene gives innovative outsiders (identified as scientists who did not collaborate with
the dead scientist) the space they need to flourish. But then is a scientist’s death a positive
or a negative force from the standpoint of preserving a scientist’s legacy?
A tentative answer is that there are two countervailing effects. On the one hand, the
death of a scientist gives her supporters a temporary platform for calling attention to her
work, thus helping her work gain recognition relative to other work. But on the other hand,
unless these supporters have effective control of their field, their temporary platform does not
block the arrival of outsiders who might wish to challenge the existing paradigm with new
contributions—work that soon becomes more impactful as it facilitates a paradigm shift. A
possible paradox then is that while the death of elite scientists provides a glimpse into the
informational inefficiency of science, it also increases the allocational efficiency of science in
the long run.

(the indicator variable for treatment status interacted with the year of death is omitted). The specifications also include a full set of lead and lag terms common to both
the treated and control articles to fully account for transitory trends around the time of the event. The 95% confidence interval (corresponding to [QML] robust standard
errors, clustered at the level of the scientist) around these estimates is plotted with light grey bars. Panels A, B, and C correspond to dynamic versions of the specifications
in the first, second, and third columns of Table 3, respectively.

Note: Panel A provides an histogram of the number of academic memory events for the sample of 720 deceased scientists 8,326 still living scientists, within a
window of one year before/five years after the year of death (for deceased scientists) or counterfactual year of death (for deceased scientists). In Panel B,
the dark and light grey dots correspond to coefficient estimates for the marginal effects in logit specifications modeling the probability of an academic
memory/recognition event for a scientist, as in Table 7. In addition to the list of covariates in column (7), we include age by treatment interaction effects
whose coefficients are depicted. The vertical bars correspond to 95% confidence intervals (calculated using robust standard errors).

Note: The sample consists of 720 elite academic life scientists who died while still actively engaged in research. See Appendix A for more details on the sample
construction. NIH funding amounts have been deflated by the biomedical R&D Producer Price Index (base year=2007). Forty five (6.25%) of the deceased
scientists are NIH intramural scientists and therefore not eligible for extramural NIH funding. The funding totals are computed for the 720-45=675
scientists eligible to receive NIH awards.

Note: The sample consists of all of the publications for treated and control scientists that the matching procedure described in Appendix C has culled from the
universe of last-authored original publications by deceased and still-alive scientists. The matching procedure is “one-to-many”: each treated article is matched
with zero, one, or more control articles. The procedure matches 62% of eligible treated articles. The average number of control articles per treated article in
the matched sample is 16.75 (median=6; std. dev.=28.6; min.=1; max.=281). The descriptive statistics above are weighted by the inverse number of controls
in a matching strata. All time-varying covariates are measured in the year of the scientist’s death (or counterfactual year of death for the control scientist).
The article-level citation counts correspond to the accumulated stock of citations up to the year of death. NIH funding amounts have been deflated by the
biomedical R&D Producer Price Index (base year=2007).

Note: Estimates stem from fixed effects Poisson specifications. For each article, one observation per year is included in the sample in the window between the
year of publication and ten years after the (possibly counterfactual) event or 2006, whichever comes earlier. The dependent variable is the total number
of citations accrued to a publication in a particular year. All models incorporate a full suite of year effects and nine article age effects, as well as a term
common to both treated and control articles that switches from zero to one after the death of the scientist, to address the concern that age, year and
individual fixed effects may not fully account for transitory citation trends after death. Exponentiating the coefficients and differencing from one yield
numbers interpretable as elasticities. For example, the estimate in the first column implies that the papers of deceased scientists posthumously experience
a 100×(exp[0.071]-1)=7.36% statistically significant increase in the number of citations relative to papers whose author remained alive. The number of
observations varies slightly across columns because the conditional fixed effects specification drops observations corresponding to articles for which there
is no variation in activity across the entire observation period. This is also true for the results reported in Tables 4, 5, and 6.

10%”) column corresponds to an estimation sample comprising solely the top 10% (resp. bottom 10%) of each scientist’s publications, ranked in terms
cumulative citations at the time of death (or counterfactual time of death for control scientists). “Own 25%-75%” limits the estimation sample to
publications in the middle two quartiles of the citation distribution at the time of death. The “Universe Top 1%” limits the estimation sample to
articles that fall above the 99th percentile of the vintage-specific citation distribution at the time of death in the universe of publications indexed by
PubMed and the Web of Science. Exponentiating the coefficients and differencing from one yield numbers interpretable as elasticities. For example,

Note: Estimates stem from conditional fixed effects Poisson specifications. For each article, one observation per year is included in the sample in the window
between the year of publication and ten years after the (possibly counterfactual) event or 2006, whichever comes earlier. The dependent variable is the
total number of citations accrued to a publication in a particular year. The estimation samples in each column corresponds to sample splits across the
median of two individual characteristics of the scientists in the sample, assessed in the year of death: accumulated number of distinct collaborators, and
self-promotion behavior. All models incorporate a full suite of year effects and nine article age effects, as well as a term common to both treated and
control articles that switches from zero to one after the death of the scientist, to address the concern that age, year and individual fixed effects may not
fully account for transitory citation trends after death. Exponentiating the coefficients and differencing from one yield numbers interpretable as elasticities.
For example, the estimate in the second column implies that the papers of scientists of deceased scientists with above the median number of coauthors at
the time of their death posthumously experience a 100×(exp[0.122]-1)=12.98% increase in the number of citations relative to papers whose author remained
alive (and are also below the median number of coauthors at the time of their counterfactual death). The number of observations varies slightly across
columns because the conditional fixed effects specification drops observations corresponding to articles for which there is no variation in activity over the
entire observation period. This is also true for the results reported in Tables 3 through 6.

Note: Estimates stem from fixed effects Poisson specifications. For each article, one observation per year is included in the sample in the window between
the year of publication and ten years after the (possibly counterfactual) event or 2006, whichever comes earlier. The dependent variable is the total
number of citations of a particular type accrued to a publication in a particular year. The type of citations considered include (i) citations from
coauthors vs. non-coauthors; (ii) citations from the same narrow subfield vs. those from other subfields (the PubMed Related Citations Algorithm
[PMRA] is used to distinguish between in-field vs. out-of-field citations); and (iii) citations from co-located authors vs. distant authors. All models
incorporate a full suite of year effects and nine article age effects, as well as a term common to both treated and control articles that switches from
zero to one after the death of the scientist, to address the concern that age, year and individual fixed effects may not fully account for transitory
citation trends after death. Exponentiating the coefficients and differencing from one yield numbers interpretable as elasticities. For example, the
estimate in the sixth column implies that the papers of deceased scientists experience a posthumous 100×(exp[0.183]-1)=20.08% increase in the number
of citations from co-located scientists. The number of observations varies slightly across columns because the conditional fixed effects specification
drops observations corresponding to articles for which there is no variation in activity over the entire observation period. This is also true for the
results reported in Tables 3 through 5.

Note: Estimates are marginal effects from logit specifications. The sample consists of a cross-section of the 720 deceased scientists and 8,326 still living
scientists. The response variable is the existence of at least one academic memory/recognition event created for a scientist in a window of one year
before/five years after the death for the deceased (or counterfactual death for the still-living scientists). All models include—but do not report—
controls for degree type (PhD and MD/PhD, MD is the omitted category), a suite of indicator variables for each death year, six indicator variables
for age categories at the time of death (less than 45 years old; between 45 and 55 years old; between 55 and 60 years old; between 60 and 65 old;

indicator variable for unknown cause of death. The number of coauthors measure exclude the number of trainees, so that there is no double counting

Note: Estimates stem from OLS specifications. The dependent variable is the number of “excess” citations, which is simply the number of actual posthumous
citations minus the number of predicted posthumous citations, based on the prediction model presented in Section 3.5 and Appendix D. In columns 1a, 1b,
and 1c, all post-death/post-counterfactual death citations are used to compute the prediction, whereas in columns 2a, 2b, and 2c, citations that accrue in
the first five years after death are excluded, as well as citations given by collaborators and memorializers of the deceased. Because the distribution of excess
citations is both skewed and takes on negative values, a NegLog transformation of the dependent variable (Yeo and Johnson 2000) is performed before
estimation. All models include (but do not report coefficients for) a full suite of indicator variables for age at death, year of death, year of the article’s
publication, degree type, and cause of death. Robust standard errors, clustered at the level of the scientist in parentheses. †p < 0.10, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.

Note: Estimates stem from conditional fixed effects Poisson specifications. For each article, one observation per year is included in the sample in the window
between the year of publication and ten years after the (possibly counterfactual) event or 2006, whichever comes earlier. The dependent variable is the
total number of citations accrued to a publication in a particular year. The estimation samples in each column correspond to sample splits across the
median of three individual scientist characteristics assessed in the year of death: cumulative publications, cumulative citations, and cumulative NIH
funding. All models incorporate a full suite of year effects and nine article age effects, as well as a term common to both treated and control articles that
switches from zero to one after the death of the scientist, to address the concern that age, year and individual fixed effects may not fully account for
transitory citation trends after death. Exponentiating the coefficients and differencing from one yield numbers interpretable as elasticities. For example,
the estimate in the second column implies that the papers of scientists of deceased scientists with above the median number of publications at the time of
their death posthumously experience a 100×(exp[0.108]-1)=11.40% increase in the number of citations relative to papers whose author remained alive (and
are also below the median number of publications at the time of their counterfactual death). The number of observations varies slightly across columns
because the conditional fixed effects specification drops observations corresponding to articles for which there is no variation in activity over the entire
observation period. The last two columns drop from the sample articles written by 318 scientists (273 treated scientists and 45 control scientists) who are
“intramural employees” of the NIH, and therefore not eligible to receive extramural NIH funds. Robust (QML) standard errors in parentheses, clustered

Appendix A:
Criteria for Delineating the Set of 13,426 Elite Scientists
Scientists enter the elite sample if they meet at least one of the following seven criteria:
Highly Funded Scientists. Our first data source is the Consolidated Grant/Applicant File (CGAF)
from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). This dataset records information about grants awarded
to extramural researchers funded by the NIH since 1938. Using the CGAF and focusing only on direct
costs associated with research grants, we compute individual cumulative totals for the decades 1977-1986,
1987-1996, and 1997-2006, deflating the corresponding amounts with the Biomedical Research Producer Price
Index. We also recompute these totals excluding large center grants that usually fund groups of investigators
(M01 and P01 grants). Scientists whose totals lie above the 95th percentile of either distribution constitute
our first group of superstars. In this group, the least well-funded investigator garnered $10.5 million in career
NIH funding and the most well-funded $462.6 million.i
Highly Cited Scientists. Despite the preeminent role of the NIH in the funding of public biomedical
research, the above indicator of “superstardom” biases the sample towards scientists conducting relatively
expensive research. We complement this first group with a second composed of highly cited scientists
identified by the Institute for Scientific Information. A Highly Cited listing means that an individual was
among the 250 most cited researchers for their published articles between 1981 and 1999, within a broad
scientific field.ii
Top Patenters. We add to these groups academic life scientists who belong in the top percentile of the
patent distribution among academics—those who were granted 17 patents or more between 1976 and 2004.
Members of the National Academy of Science and of the Institute of Medicine. We add to
these groups academic life scientists who were elected to the National Academy of Science or the Institute
of Medicine between 1970 and 2013.
MERIT Awardees of the NIH. Initiated in the mid-1980s, the MERIT Award program extends funding for up to 5 years (but typically 3 years) to a select number of NIH-funded investigators “who have
demonstrated superior competence, outstanding productivity during their previous research endeavors and
are leaders in their field with paradigm-shifting ideas.” The specific details governing selection vary across
the component institutes of the NIH, but the essential feature of the program is that only researchers holding
an R01 grant in its second or later cycle are eligible. Further, the application must be scored in the top
percentile in a given funding cycle.
Former and current Howard Hughes Medical Investigators (HHMIs). Every three years, the
Howard Hughes Medical Institute selects a small cohort of mid-career biomedical scientists with the potential
to revolutionize their respective subfields. Once selected, HHMIs continue to be based at their institutions,
typically leading a research group of 10 to 25 students, postdoctoral associates and technicians. Their
appointment is reviewed every five years, based solely on their most important contributions during the
cycle.iii
Early career prize winners. We also included winners of the Pew, Searle, Beckman, Rita Allen, and
Packard scholarships for the years 1981 through 2000. Every year, these charitable foundations provide seed
i

We perform a similar exercise for scientists employed by the intramural campus of the NIH. These scientists are not eligible
to receive extramural funds, but the NIH keeps records of the number of “internal projects” each intramural scientist leads. We
include in the elite sample the top five percentiles of intramural scientists according to this metric.
ii
The relevant scientific fields in the life sciences are microbiology, biochemistry, psychiatry/psychology, neuroscience, molecular biology & genetics, immunology, pharmacology, and clinical medicine.

funding to between 20 and 40 young academic life scientists. These scholarships are the most prestigious
accolades that young researchers can receive in the first two years of their careers as independent investigators.

Appendix B: Linking Scientists with their Journal Articles
The source of our publication data is PubMed, a bibliographic database maintained by the U.S. National
Library of Medicine that is searchable on the web at no cost.iv PubMed contains over 29 million citations
from 4,800 journals published in the United States and more than 70 other countries from 1950 to the present.
The subject scope of this database is biomedicine and health, broadly defined to encompass those areas of
the life sciences, behavioral sciences, chemical sciences, and bioengineering that inform research in healthrelated fields. In order to effectively mine this publicly-available data source, we designed PubHarvester,
an open-source software tool that automates the process of gathering publication information for individual
life scientists (see Azoulay et al. 2006 for a complete description of the software). PubHarvester is fast,
simple to use, and reliable. Its output consists of a series of reports that can be easily imported by statistical
software packages.
This software tool does not obviate the two challenges faced by empirical researchers when attempting
to accurately link individual scientists with their published output. The first relates to what one might
term “Type I Error,” whereby we mistakenly attribute to a scientist a journal article actually authored by
a namesake; The second relates to “Type II error,” whereby we conservatively exclude from a scientist’s
publication roster legitimate articles:
Namesakes and popular names. PubMed does not assign unique identifiers to the authors of the
publications they index. They identify authors simply by their last name, up to two initials, and an optional
suffix. This makes it difficult to unambiguously assign publication output to individual scientists, especially
when their last name is relatively common.
Inconsistent publication names. The opposite danger, that of recording too few publications, also looms
large, since scientists are often inconsistent in the choice of names they choose to publish under. By far the
most common source of error is the haphazard use of a middle initial. Other errors stem from inconsistent
use of suffixes (Jr., Sr., 2nd, etc.), or from multiple patronyms due to changes in spousal status.
To deal with these serious measurement problems, we opted for a labor-intensive approach: the design of
individual search queries that relies on relevant scientific keywords, the names of frequent collaborators,
journal names, as well as institutional affiliations. We are aided in the time-consuming process of query
design by the availability of a reliable archival data source, namely, these scientists’ CVs and biosketches.
PubHarvester provides the option to use such custom queries in lieu of a completely generic query (e.g,
"azoulay p"[au] or "graff zivin js"[au]). As an example, one can examine the publications of Scott A.
Waldman, an eminent pharmacologist located in Philadelphia, PA at Thomas Jefferson University. Waldman
is a relatively frequent name in the United States (with 208 researchers with an identical patronym in the
AAMC faculty roster); the combination "waldman s" is common to 3 researchers in the same database.
A simple search query for "waldman sa"[au] OR "waldman s"[au] returns 377 publications at the time
of this writing. However, a more refined query, based on Professor Waldman’s biosketch returns only 256
publications.v

point[ad] OR wong p[au] OR lasseter kc[au] OR colorectal))) AND 1980:2013[dp])
v

ii

The above example also makes clear how we deal with the issue of inconsistent publication names. PubHarvester gives the end-user the option to choose up to four PubMed-formatted names under which
publications can be found for a given researcher. For example, Louis J. Tobian, Jr. publishes under "tobian
l", "tobian l jr", and "tobian lj", and all three names need to be provided as inputs to generate a
complete publication listing. Furthermore, even though Tobian is a relatively rare name, the search query
needs to be modified to account for these name variations, as in ("tobian l"[au] OR "tobian lj"[au]).

Appendix C: Construction of the Control Group
We detail the procedure implemented to identify the control publications that help pin down the life-cycle
and secular time effects in our difference-in-differences (DD) specification. Happenstance might yield a
sample of publications from aging scientists, or in out-of-fashion fields. More plausibly, article-level citation
trends might be subject to idiosyncratic life-cycle patterns, reflecting the article’s vintage, the age of its
lead author, the vitality of its subfield, or the recency of its methods. Relying solely on publications treated
earlier or later as an implicit control group raises the worry that these time-varying omitted variables will
not be fully captured by publication age controls.
To address this concern, we create an additional level of difference by selecting control publications. Recall
that we can accurately identify the complete publication history of all the elite scientists in the superstar
sample (deceased, retired, or still living, cf. Appendix B). Therefore, we can potentially identify articles
written by still-alive scientists who are “similar” to those written by the deceased scientists. But what are
the characteristics of a satisfactory article control, and what are the characteristics of satisfactory control
group? The distinction between the two is subtle and important. Our difference-in-differences empirical
analysis relies on a counterfactual date of death for a control article, and a counterfactual eminent scientist
who could have died, but did not, to produce various sample splits. It is therefore important that a control
article might be paired appropriately, since it will inherit certain characteristics from its associated treated
article.
Judgement is required to decide the list of covariates for which balance between control and treated units
is required to generate internally valid comparisons. The analyst faces a sharp trade-off between internal
and external validity, since an exhaustive list of covariates on which to guarantee balance ex ante would
result in very few (and maybe even no) matches. Therefore, the principle that guides the selection of control
articles is to choose the least restrictive set of covariates that results, ex post, in a control group that we
can regard as comparable enough to not jeopardize the internal validity of the empirical analysis. Below, we
make the modeling choices explicit in the spirit of giving the reader a view on the process through which
our understanding of the setting translated into very practical considerations regarding matching.
In practice, we would like each control article to:
1. be published contemporaneously with, and to have a similar number of authors as, the article by a
treated (i.e., deceased) scientist with which it is paired;
2. be unrelated (in both an intellectual and a social sense) to the article by a treated scientist with which
it is paired;
3. have an author in last-author position who is a still-living elite scientist of approximately the same
age as that of the deceased scientist on the article with which it is paired.vi
vi
“Still living” means not only that the scientist is alive at the time of the counterfactual death, but that s/he will remain
alive over the five years that follow.

iii

We think of these “pair-level” requirements as a necessary baseline. Clearly, if control and treated articles
are of vastly different vintage, or with a vastly different number of authors, it makes little sense to compare
their citation trajectories. If they are related intellectually or socially (e.g., the elite scientist on one is a
collaborator of the elite scientist on the other, or the PubMed Related Citation Algorithm lists one as an
intellectual neighbor for the other), then the “control” could well be treated by the event as well. The last
requirement is sensible once it is understood that there is a publication and citation life cycle for scientists
in general (see Figure 1B), and that there is wide variation in the age at death in the sample of 720 deceased
scientists.
In addition, we would like the control group of articles as a whole to be broadly similar to the treated
group of articles, where similarity should be understood as reflecting average balance across key covariates
at baseline—shortly before the death event.vii
As a result, we impose the following additional requirement to select control articles:
4. that they be of similar expected impact, relative to the article from the treated scientist;
To match on expected impact at baseline, we experimented with the following covariates: (i) the journal in
which the treated article was published (so that the control will be recruited from the set of articles published
in the same journal); (ii) the journal impact factor of the journal in which the treated article was published
(when not imposing same-journal match); and (iii) the number of citations that cumulatively accrued to the
treated article up to the baseline year (i.e. the year of death).
Because we found that the balance between the treated and control groups was compromised when we did
not impose same-journal match, below we provide descriptive evidence with three alternative approaches.
The least restrictive imposes same-journal match with no additional restriction on the number of citations
received by treated and control articles at baseline; the intermediate version imposes same-journal match
with relatively coarse restrictions on the number of citations received by treated and control articles at
baseline; and the most restrictive imposes same-journal match with relatively fine restrictions on the number
of citations received by treated and control articles at baseline.
Finally, since the combined treated and control article dataset will be analyzed in a difference-in-differences
framework, rather than in the cross-sectional dimension of the data, the appropriateness of the control group
must eventually be assessed on its ability to exhibit parallel citation trends (our outcome of interest) before
the event of interest with those of the treated group of articles. In this respect, the work presented here is
similar in flavor to recent studies that also rely on blocking techniques as a device to select a control group
in the cross-sectional dimension of the data, before combining treated and control units in a panel dataset
(e.g., Jaravel et al. 2018; Azoulay et al. 2019).
One can also ask how the step of selecting a control group might impact statistical inference in the second
step of the analysis. Recent work by Abadie and Spiess (2019) suggests that clustering the standard errors
at the level of the strata used to pair control and treated units results in conservative inference. Since we
cluster our standard errors at the level of the scientist, a level that nests the matching strata, we can ignore
the influence of the matching step in the difference-in-differences results we present.
Article-level or scientist-level covariates? An important design choice is whether to privilege balance
on article-level characteristics or scientist-level characteristics. A case can be made that both are important:
our difference-in-differences specification uses the article as the level of analysis, but the treatment corresponds to a scientist-level event, namely death. In practice, we found that imposing balance on article-level
characteristics yielded approximate balance on scientist-level characteristics as well, as a fortunate byproduct, whereas the reverse was not true. As a consequence, we will focus on variants where we tweak the list
of article-level characteristics that must match between treated and control articles.
Blocking on covariates. To meet these goals, we implement a blocking procedure in the spirit of coarsened
exact matching (Blackwell et al. 2009). The first step is to select a relatively small set of covariates on which
vii

Of course, balance on other moments of the distribution of these covariates would be desirable as well.

iv

we need to guarantee balance ex ante, guided by the set of criteria listed above. The second step is to create
a large number of strata to cover the entire support of the joint distribution of the covariates selected in the
previous step. In a third step, each observation is allocated to a unique stratum, and for each observation
in the treated group, control observations are selected from the same stratum. This procedure is “coarse”
in the sense that we do not attempt to precisely match on covariate values; rather, we coarsen the support
of the joint distribution of the covariates into a finite number of strata, and we match a treated observation
if and only if a control observation can be recruited from this strata. The procedure is also “exact” in the
sense that one either finds one control or more in a stratum, or one finds none, in which case the treated
article is eliminated from the analytic sample. As a result, the more fine-grained the partition of the support
for the joint distribution (i.e., the higher the number of strata), the larger the number of unmatched treated
observations.viii
Implementation. We identify controls based on the following set of covariates: scientist career age; number
of authors; position of the star author on the authorship roster (only last authorship position is considered);
journal; and year of publication. The first two covariates only need to match within relatively coarse bins.
For instance, we require that the career ages (years since the highest degree was earned) of the treated
and control elite scientists be no more than two years apart. We coarsen the distribution of the number of
authors by collapsing it onto four separate bins: solo-authored publications; publications with two, three, or
four authors; publications with between five and eight authors; and publications with nine authors or more
(the maximum is fifteen authors). In contrast, we impose an exact match on journal, publication year, and
the star’s authorship position.
To explore the sensitivity of our results to the choice of covariate blocking scheme, we propose three variants
that make use of an additional covariate, the distribution of accumulated citations up to the baseline year
(i.e., t − 1 if t denotes the year of death). Under the most restrictive scheme, we coarsen the distribution of
citations into the following bins: bottom ten percentiles; between the 10th and the 25th percentiles; second
quartile; third quartile; between the 75th and the 95th percentiles; between the 95th and the 99th percentiles;
and above the 99th percentile.ix
The second variant coarsens the distribution of accumulated citations in t − 1 slightly: bottom quartile;
middle two quartiles; between the 75th and the 95th percentile; between the 95th and the 99th percentiles;
and above the 99th percentile. The third and final variant ignores the number of citations received at baseline
altogether when selecting controls. It is therefore the least restrictive.
Regardless of the variant, we drop from the data any control article whose last author collaborated with the
deceased scientist, as well as any control article who is a PMRA “intellectual neighbor” with its associated
treated article. After these tweaks (which drop only a very small number of articles), we further drop from
the sample any “orphan” article (i.e., a treated unpaired with any control, or a set of controls that has lost
its treated source).
Figure D1 displays the distribution of the number of control articles per treated article under each scheme.
Unsurprisingly, the size of the samples corresponding to each variant differ. The most restrictive and intermediate versions are quite similar in size, matching approximately 50% of the eligible treated articles. In
contrast, the least restrictive variant matches 60% of the eligible treated articles, and can recruit many more
controls in each strata (eighteen on average, versus approximately seven under the more restrictive schemes).
Regardless of the variant, Panels D, E, and F of Figure D1 show that baseline citations are well balanced, not
only on average, but for every quantile of the distribution. Table C1—with a structure identical to Table 2
viii

Note that Iacus et al. (2011) pioneered coarsened exact matching (CEM) as an alternative to the propensity score, in the
context of estimating valid causal effects in cross-sectional regressions, under the assumption of unconfoundedness. In contrast,
we are merely using it as a sensible blocking technique to delineate a control group which we will then combine with our group
of treated article in a longitudinal, article-level panel dataset. In particular, any fixed difference across articles (or their authors)
would be swept out by the article fixed effect in our estimation framework.
ix
The distributions of citation at the article-level are vintage-specific, i.e., for each possible year of publication, we compute
quantiles of the citation distribution after one year, after two years,. . . , after n years, only limited by the coverage of the Web
of Science data at our disposal (1950-2015).

in the main body of the manuscript—provides descriptive statistics for the analytic samples corresponding
to each scheme. While balance on these covariates is, for most of them, guaranteed by the blocking procedure, note that the investigator’s overall citation count at baseline, which was not used in matching, is also
remarkably similar for in the treated and control samples, regardless of the variant considered.
Table C2 and Figure C2 are analogs of Table 3 and Panel A of Figure 4 in the main body of the manuscript,
and speak to the causal effect of death on the citation trajectories of treated articles, relative to control
articles, after death, relative to before. The results are closely similar across variants, buttressing the claim
that our core set of results is not an artefact of the idiosyncrasies of the matching scheme selected. In
particular, in all of these variants, one cannot detect meaningful differential citation trends for treated and
control articles, in the years preceding the death. Only in the few years after the year of death can one
observe a meaningful increase in the rate of citations, which appears not to be sustained after the fourth or
fifth year, depending on the variant. In our view, all three variants therefore result in a control group with
desirable properties from the standpoint of a difference-in-differences analysis.
In light of the above, the main body of the manuscript carries out the analysis under the least restrictive
blocking scheme, with its higher fraction of eligible treated articles matched, and a lower ratio of treated to
control articles (' 1 : 17).

and control article in a ratio of 1:7 on average). Panel B corresponds to the matching scheme with an intermediate level of restrictiveness, which drops 59%
of the eligible treated articles for want of a match (treated and control article in a ratio of 1:8 approximately). Finally, the least restrictive scheme (and the
one used in the main body of the manuscript) drops 38% of the eligible articles by deceased scientists (treated and control article in a ratio of 1:17
approximately). Panels D, E, and, F display the distribution of the cumulative number of citations up to the baseline year for the treated and control articles
respectively, under each of the three proposed matching schemes.

Note: For each matching scheme, the sample consists of all of the publications for treated and control scientists that the procedure described in Appendix C has culled
from the universe of last-authored original publications by deceased and still-alive scientists. The matching procedure is “one-to-many”: each treated article is
matched with zero, one, or more control articles. The descriptive statistics above are weighted by the inverse number of controls in a matching strata. All timevarying covariates are measured in the year of the scientist’s death (or counterfactual year of death for the control scientist). The article-level citation counts
correspond to the accumulated stock of citations up to the year of death.

Note: Estimates stem from fixed effects Poisson specifications. For each article, one observation per year is included in the sample in the window between the
year of publication and ten years after the (possibly counterfactual) event or 2006, whichever comes earlier. The dependent variable is the total number of
citations accrued to a publication in a particular year. All models incorporate a full suite of year effects and nine article age effects, as well as a term
common to both treated and control articles that switches from zero to one after the death of the scientist, to address the concern that age, year and
individual fixed effects may not fully account for transitory citation trends after death. The number of observations varies slightly across columns because
the conditional fixed effects specification drops observations corresponding to articles for which there is no variation in activity across the entire observation
period. Robust (QML) standard errors in parentheses, clustered at the level of the star scientist. †p < 0.10, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.

Appendix D: Predicting Posthumous Citations
The difference-in-differences specification (eqn. (1), page 22) is the basis for the estimation of the causal
effect of a scientist’s premature passing on the flow of recognition at the article level. The model allows one
to estimate the conditional expectation of the citation response, and does not rely on the specific features
of the Poisson distribution (cf. Santos Silva and Tenreyro 2006, Wooldridge 1997).
Another goal of our study is to establish the plausibility of memorialization as a mechanism that contributes
to explaining our core finding, that of a relative increase in recognition after a superstar scientist passes
away. In order to do so, we must generate a measure of predicted posthumous citation for each article by a
deceased scientist. To do so, we collapse the article-level panel data for both treated and control scientists
onto a cross-section where the outcome of interest in the actual number of total posthumous citations, and
two separate sets of covariates (also denoted by the term “predictive features” or simply “features”). The
first set comprises only a parsimonious list of 140 features. The second set adds an additional 588 features.
To be more precise, the restricted set includes the number of citations that accrued to the article in the predeath (or pre-counterfactual death) period (log transformed, with an indicator variable absorbing the zero
citation cases—19,185 articles or 4% of the sample), a female scientist indicator variable, year of publication
effects, indicator variables for type of degree (MD, PhD, and MD/PhD), a full suite of indicator variables
for the scientists’ year of (possibly counterfactual) death, a series of indicator variables for scientists’ highest
degree graduation years, and a series of 30 indicator variables corresponding to the article age at time of
death. The expanded set of features include all the covariates in the restricted set plus (i) 472 indicator
variables for each journal (427 journals who contribute less than 10 article observations to the dataset are
collapsed onto a single indicator variable), (ii) 14 indicator variables for the number of authors on the paper
(the top category include all authorship lists including 15 or more authors, approximately 0.15% of the
sample), (iii) 20 indicator variables for each ventile of the number of trainees distribution (at the time of
death), (iv) 20 indicator variables for each ventile of the number of coauthors distribution (at the time
of death), (v) a dummy for intramural scientists as well as 20 indicator variables for each ventile of the
cumulative NIH funding distribution (at the time of death), and (vi) 20 indicator variables for each ventile
of the “self-promotion” distribution (at the time of death). Importantly, the list of features does not include
an indicator for deceased scientists.
Using these features, we then perform a variety of predictive exercises using a mix of classic and more novel
techniques:
(a) A negative binomial maximum likelihood procedure where posthumous citations are regressed on the
restricted set of covariates;
(b) A high-dimensional fixed effects quasi-maximum likelihood Poisson routine (Correia et al. 2019) where
posthumous citations are regressed on the expanded set of covariates;
(c) A penalized Poisson procedure using Lasso regularization and the expanded set of covariates. Specifically, we use the “plugin formula” (Belloni et al. 2016) to minimize the Lasso objective function.
In this framework, the penalization parameters are chosen to guarantee consistent prediction and
parameter estimation.
Table D1 provides a correlation table for the actual and predicted posthumous citations using these three
approaches. The three prediction methods yield predicted values that are highly correlated with one another,
although the correlation between actual and predicted citations is lowest using the penalized Poisson procedure. To choose among these alternatives, we compare their out-of-sample predictive power, using model
deviance as the prediction metric.x Specifically, each model is trained on an 80% subsample of articles (clustering on investigator) and tested on the remaining 20%. The Lasso-penalized Poisson procedure exhibits
x
The deviance is a classic goodness-of-fit measure for count data models (Cameron and Windmeijer 1996) and its use here
mirrors the role of the root-mean-square error (RMSE) for prediction in the context of linear models.

xi

by far the best out-of-sample performance, with the lowest deviance overall and very similar deviances on
both the training and the testing sample. Table D2 provides the full set of diagnostics for this procedure
using four different response variables: posthumous citations, posthumous citations, excluding citations from
memorializers and coauthors, posthumous citations outside of the window of five years that begins with the
year of death, and posthumous citations outside of the window of five years that begins with the year of
death, excluding citations from memorializers and coauthors.xi
In the main body of the manuscript, we therefore make use of the predictions generated by the penalized
Poisson procedure. We sum the article-level predictions to generate an individual-level measure of predicted
citation “afterlife” for each deceased scientist. Panel A of Figure D1 displays the histogram for the distribution of this measure. Panel B of Figure D1 displays the histogram for the distribution of “excess citations,”
i.e., the difference between actual posthumous citations received and the predicted score.

xi

In contrast, the negative binomial procedure exhibits a deviance ratio that is an order of magnitude higher for the testing
sample, relative to the training sample. This comparison is not available for the HDFE Poisson procedure because it cannot
project out-of-sample for the fixed effects that are not estimated when performing the routine on the training subsample.

Note: We contrast three approaches to predict citations at the article level in the years after the death on the basis
of covariates known at the time of death. The first approach stems from a penalized lasso Poisson procedure
using the plugin method of Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Wei (2016) using an extensive set of more than 700
covariates, including a comprehensive set of journal fixed effects. The second stems from a high-dimensional
fixed effects Poisson estimation routine recently proposed by Correia, Guimarães, and Zylkin (2019) using a
similarly extensive of covariates, but without a penalty term to prevent overfitting. The third and final set of
predictions stem from a negative binomial model estimated by maximum likelihood using a more parsimonious
set of “only” 140 predictors. All the correlation coefficients reported above precisely estimated (p<0.001).

using a Lasso Poisson procedure, using 728 covariates. Panel B (in light grey) displays the distribution of posthumous “excess” citations for the 720 treated
scientists. “Excess” citations are defined by the difference, for each scientist, between the actual of citations garnered posthumously with the number of
citations from our predictive model. Note that rather than an “excess,” for many deceased scientists one can observe a “shortfall” of citations as they receive
fewer posthumous citations than our model predicted. Sixty seven outliers with more than 1,500 predicted cumulative posthumous citations are omitted in
the pictures above, solely to help its legibility (they are included in the statistical analysis).

Appendix E: Collecting Data on Recognition Events
Identifying recognition events for the deceased and the still-living. We collect events recorded
in academic journals that celebrate, recognize, or memorialize the scientists in our sample, whether they
are deceased or still-living. The challenge is to do so in a manner this consistent over time and does not
entail a built-in recognition bias in favor of the deceased. To do so, we rely on PubMed, a publicly available
bibliometric database curated by the Library of Medicine, which contains, as of 2019, 29 million records for
the biomedical research literature, life science journals, and online books. The coverage of this database is
extensive, both in its depth (with more than 5,000 journals indexed) and its longitudinal dimension (with
comprehensive coverage of the english-language research literature since the early 1950s).
Helpfully, every publication in PubMed is tagged by one or more of 80 distinct publication types (“Letters,”
“Journal Articles,” “Meta-Analysis,” “Randomized Controlled Trial”. . . ). Ten of these publication types
could potentially denote a recognition event: Autobiography, Bibliography, Biography, Collected Works,
Festschrift, Interview, Introductory Journal Article, Lectures, Personal Narrative, and Portrait. Focusing
on the 413,611 articles tagged by one of these publication type contained in the 2019 version of PubMed, we
extract 22,912 articles whose title include the last name of one of the scientist, and either his/her first name
or middle name. We then handcode each of these records to filter out those that do not pertain to one of the
9,046 scientists in the sample, but rather to an homonym. The resulting dataset contains 5,850 individual
articles.
We then classify each of these articles into five mutually exclusive categories: obituaries, festschrifts, interviews, awards and medals, and a residual category which include events such as a republished “classic”
articles with a commentary, reminiscences about the role of a scientist in the history of his/her field, autobiographical notes, etc. The first two rows of Table E1 provide a breakdown of the number of articles by
category, separately for deceased and still-living scientists. While there are more events overall in the control
sample, this reflects that the ratio of deceased to control scientists is roughly 1 : 12. Per scientist, there are
many more events for the deceased than for the still living (1.74 vs. 0.52 on average).
An oddity is that 9% of the control scientists have an obituary written about them. Recall that in order to
contribute an article to the control sample, an elite scientist must be alive five years after the year of death
for the deceased scientist with whom s/he is matched. Yet, they might have died in the ensuing years. More
typically, many of the other types of recognition events for the still-living scientists arrive in the twilight of
their careers, or after they have retired.
In order to compare the intensity of recognition between the prematurely deceased and still-alive scientists,
we leverage our research design. Recall that a byproduct of the matching procedure at the article level (cf.
Appendix C) is to generate a counterfactual year of death for each elite scientist whose articles match those
of treated scientists. This counterfactual year of death provides a temporal anchor to compare recognition
for the deceased as well as the living. A slight complication arises since the same scientist can serve as
control multiple times, for different treated scientists who passed away in different years between 1969 and
2003. As a result, there is typically more than one counterfactual year of death for each control scientist.
To get around this problem, we simply select one of the possible counterfactual years of death for each
living scientist at random. We then use a window of one year before until four years after the year of death
(or counterfactual death) symmetrically for deceased and control scientists, and simply sum the number of
recognition events for each scientist within that window.
The third and fourth rows of Table E1 break down the recognition events after filtering out events that fall
outside of this design-inspired window. By construction, every control scientist is alive during that time
period, which implies that the number of obituaries for these scientists is exactly zero. In fact, only 6% of
the control scientists are recognized at all during the window, versus 49% of the deceased scientists.
Figure E1, Panels A and B display the corresponding histograms for the total number of recognition events,
broken down by treatment status. Two facts should be emphasized. First, the distribution of recognition is

xvi

extremely skewed for deceased and still-living scientists. Second, per scientist the deceased are recognized
much more intensely than the living.
A finer-grained look at memorialization for the deceased. The focus on academic memory events
was justified in light of the fact that they are recorded consistently over time, and that the set of criteria used
to collect them does not entail a bias that mechanically produces more events for deceased scientists. At the
same time, it is clear that deceased scientists are memorialized through more diverse channels than simply
by publications in the biomedical literature. The second part of this appendix attends to this diversity by
systematically collecting memory events for deceased scientists, regardless of source.
To get a broader view of memorialization, we add to the academic literature search systematic internet
Google searches. Specifically, we searched for the scientists name, degree, and death year (e.g, John Gibbon,
MD 1973). We categorized the valid search results as university web posts, New York Times and other
newspaper obituaries, Wikipedia pages, and miscellaneous online obituaries. We labeled these memories
“popular memories,” and we found an average of just over two per scientist. Table E2 reports basic statistics
on the classification of memory events by type.
Below we report additional results that seek to provide more context and some nuance for understanding
the results reported in Section 4.2.1. “Estimating the Determinants of Recognition.” In particular, the data
on recognition events including still living scientists was sparse, precluding an analysis of its intensity, and
the key outcome of interest was simply the presence of at least one event in the design window of [−1; 5]
years around the year of death/counterfactual death. Figure E2 displays the histogram for the distribution
of total memory events (i.e., “academic”+“popular”) in the sample of 720 deceased scientists only. Twenty
one (2.9%) scientists in the sample are never memorialized, which means that their passing was ascertained
from the social security administration death index, or a mention in a publication that appeared after their
death.
Figure E3 displays the memorialization-age gradient in the raw data. Older scientists do tend to get memorialized more intensely, but the difference is especially stark for the relatively small number of scientists who
die at a very advanced age (75 years old and up), but before retiring from research activities. One way to
interpret these findings is that scientists who remain productive and “at the top of their game” very late in
life are “forces of nature” whose very longevity invites a vigorous memorialization effort.xii
Who are the memorializers? For the 720 deceased scientists, we examine the authors of academic memory
events and identify 1,332 unique memorializer/deceased pairs for the 1,256 academic memory events in the
dataset for which we can obtain a PubMed article identifier (74.89% of the 1,677 total academic memories).
For 1,025 (76.95%) of these pairs, the full text is available from PubMed and we can determine the type
of relationship that exist between memorializing and memorialized individuals. We consider three types of
relationships. The first category is social, as in the case of a former collaborator, mentor, or trainee. The
second type corresponds to intellectual linkages, as in the case of a colleague or editor of a journal in the
same field. The third basis for relationships is purely organizational, as in the case of department colleagues
within the same institution. This leaves a small residual category of memory events written by historians
and journalists with no obvious relationship with the deceased.xiii The proportion of relationships that fall
in each category are reported in Table E3.
Almost 60% of these relationships are social in nature, and only 15% of the memorializers appear to not
have been proximate with the deceased in either the social, intellectual, or spatial dimension. The vanguard
of the salesforce is therefore drawn from a fairly narrow set of “satellites” that gravitated around the star
xii
Note that this does not contradict the results presented in Panel B of Figure 5, which demonstrated that at every age, but
particularly for the young, deceased elite scientists tend to get recognized more than still-living elite scientists.
xiii
We code these relationships to make the categories mutually exclusive: social relationships that are also intellectual
or geographic are classified as social; intellectual relationships that are also organizational (but not social) are classified as
intellectual; and only purely organizational relationships are classified as such. The residual category comprises all relationships
for which we could exclude a social, intellectual, and organizational connection.

while s/he was alive. In contrast, in Table 6, we reported that the death event appeared to mobilize citers
of all stripes; in particular, we observed no difference between the effect on the citing behavior of former
collaborators versus those who had never collaborated with the departed scientist.
The evidence is therefore consistent with a particular sequence unfolding after the death event where close
associates take on the burden of memorializing the deceased, and in certain conditions this triggers a much
wider and diffuse response that expresses itself in the form of an elevated propensity to cite the work of the
deceased.
Determinants of memorialization. Table E4 reproduces the analysis presented in Table 7, with two
important modifications. First the sample is limited to the set of 720 deceased scientists. Second, we use
Poisson specifications (with robust, quasi-maximum likelihood standard errors) rather than logit specifications since there is enough variation in this more limited sample to model the intensive memorialization
margin together with the extensive memorialization margin. The results are qualitatively similar, except for
the Self-Promoter indicator variable, which appears to correlate positively with the intensity of memorialization. Table E5 reproduces Table E4, with the small twist that NAS Biographical memoirs are omitted
from the count of academic memory events—one might be concerned that the correlation between NAS
membership and memorialization intensity reflects the built-in memorialization channel that the National
Academy of Sciences has created to celebrate the career accomplishments of its deceased members. However,
compared with Table E4, this results only in a slight attenuation of the coefficient for NAS Membership. All
other coefficients remain substantively unchanged.
For the purposes of probing the robustness of these results, we also ran identical analyses to that presented
in Table E4, but using the number of “popular” memory events, as well as the overall number of memory
events (i.e., the sum of academic and “popular” events) as an outcome. The results suggest a broadly similar
pattern, but with attenuated magnitudes and noisier estimates for some of the coefficients of interest. These
results are reported in Tables E6 and E7.

Distribution of Academic Recognition Events
A. As of 2019

B. Within the Design Window

Note: These histograms depict the distribution of the number of academic “recognition events” in the sample of 720 deceased scientists and 8,326
still living scientists. An academic recognition event corresponds to an article indexed by PubMed that references the name of a scientist and
is of the following types: obituary; festschrift; biography/autobiography; ceremony after an award/medal; interview; as well as a miscellaneous
category (see the text of the appendix for more details). In Panel A, the cumulative stock of such events is tabulated over the entire career
until April 2019. In contrast, Panel B leverages our research design, by anchoring the analysis around the time window between one year
before death and five years after death (or counterfactual death for the matched control scientists).

Figure E2
Distribution of Memory Events for the Deceased Scientists

Note: Histogram for the total number of memory events (“academic” and “popular”) in the sample of 720 deceased
scientists. A memory event can be academic (e.g., an obituary published in a journal, an award or a lecture
named after the scientist, a symposium organized in his/her memory, or a NAS biographical memoir) or popular
(e.g., a Wikipedia page, an obituary published in a newspaper or magazine, a web posting, etc.). Nineteen
scientists (2.6%) in the sample are never memorialized, which means that their passing was ascertained from
the death index from the social security administration, or a mention in a publication that appeared after the
death. The figure omits thirteen (1.8%) scientists with more than 20 memory events. The five most memorialized
scientists in the sample are: Henry Kunkel (known for his discoveries in basic immunology, 25 events); Sidney
Farber (who pioneered modern chemotherapy, 26 events); Peter Safar (who pioneered cardiopulmonary
resuscitation, 27 events); John H. Gibbon, Jr., (inventor of the heart-lung machine, 35 events); and Jonas Salk
(discoverer of the polio vaccine, 65 events).

the deceased and the memorializer are in the same institution) and for which information was available from PubMed. The
different categories have been defined to be mutually exclusive, i.e., social relationships that are also intellectual or
geographic are classified as social; intellectual relationships that are also organizational (but not social) are classified as
intellectual; and only purely organizational relationships are classified as such. The residual category comprises all
relationships for which we could exclude a social, intellectual, and spatial connection.
