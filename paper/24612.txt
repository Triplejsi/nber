Does the New Keynesian Model Have a Uniqueness Problem?

JEL No. E0,E3
ABSTRACT
This paper addresses whether non-uniqueness of equilibrium is a substantive problem for the
analysis of fiscal policy in New-Keynesian (NK) models at the zero lower bound (ZLB). There
would be a substantive problem if there were no compelling way to select among different
equilibria that give different answers to critical policy questions. We argue that learnability
provides such a criterion. We study a fully non-linear NK model with Calvo pricing frictions. Our
main finding is that the model we analyze has a unique E-stable rational expectations equilibrium
at the ZLB. That equilibrium is also stable-under-learning and inherits all of the key properties of
linearized NK models for fiscal policy.

Introduction

This paper addresses the question: is the non-uniqueness of equilibria a substantive problem for the
analysis of fiscal policy in New Keynesian (NK) models? There would be a substantive problem
if there were no compelling way to select among different equilibria that give different answers to
critical policy questions. To be concrete we focus our analysis on the impact of changes in government
consumption when the economy is at the (zero lower bound) ZLB.1
Eggertsson and Woodford (2003)(EW) and Eggertsson (2004) develop an elegant and transparent
framework for studying fiscal policy in the NK model at the ZLB. A key result from this literature
is that the output multiplier associated with government consumption is larger when the ZLB binds
than when it does not. The more binding is the ZLB constraint, the larger is the multiplier.2
These results are based on linearized versions of the NK model which have a unique bounded
minimum-state solution. In fact, non-linear versions of these models can have multiple rational
expectations equilibria. This multiplicity occurs even if one restricts attention to bounded minimumstate-variable solutions. The efficacy of fiscal policy can vary a great deal across those equilibria
(see Mertens and Ravn (2014)). At some ZLB equilibria, the government consumption multiplier
(or ‘multiplier’ for short) is small or even negative. In others, it is very large. So, in principle,
non-uniqueness of equilibria poses an enormous challenge for the analysis of fiscal policy in NK
models.
In the spirit of the literature summarized by Evans and Honkapohja (2001), we adopt E-stability
as an equilibrium selection criterion in our analysis. The concept of E-stability is closely linked
to least-squares learnability in linear models.3 We view E-stability as a necessary condition for an
equilibrium and the associated policy implications to be empirically plausible.4
We apply the E-stability criterion to a standard, fully non-linear NK model with Calvo-pricing
frictions. Working with this model poses an interesting challenge. Unlike linearized NK models of
the type considered by EW, rational expectations equilibria cannot be characterized by one set of
1 The

key constraint is that there is some lower bound (not necessarily zero) on the nominal interest rate.
for example, EW, Eggertsson (2011), Christiano et al. (2011)(CER), and Woodford (2011).
3 See Evans and Honkapohja (2001) and McCallum (2007).
4 Our notion of stability contrasts sharply with the one used in Benhabib et al. (2001) (BSGU). They study an
endowment economy populated by a representative household with preferences defined over consumption and real
balances. There is also a monetary authority that sets the nominal interest rate using a Taylor rule subject to a ZLB
constraint. BSGU show that there are two steady states corresponding to a nonnegative inflation rate and a deflation
rate equal to the household’s gross discount rate. They consider the scenario in which actual inflation πt is close to
but not exactly equal to either of the steady state values. BSGU say that a steady state is stable if the economy
converges back to it in a rational expectations equilibrium. BSGU show that the deflation steady state equilibrium is
the unique stable steady state in their sense of the term.

numbers when the ZLB binds. Because there is an endogenous state variable (price dispersion),
finding an equilibrium amounts to finding a set of functions. To this end, we conduct our analysis
using non-linear functions that approximate the equilibrium mapping from the state of the economy
to the vector of time-t endogenous variables.
Some authors have analyzed fiscal policy in a non-linear version of the NK model with Rotemberg
pricing frictions (see Boneva et al. (2016), and Evans et al. (2008)). An advantage of the Rotemberg
model is that it eliminates the endogenous state variable of price dispersion. However, others have
argued that the reduced-form adjustment cost specification in that model can have a large influence
on its implications for fiscal policy (see Ngo and Miao (2015)). To avoid this issue, we work directly
with the Calvo model. Our appendix shows that for reasonable adjustment cost specifications, a
Rotemberg model delivers qualitatively similar results to the fully non-linear Calvo model.
Using numerical methods, we show that there exists a unique interior, minimum-state equilibrium
of our non-linear Calvo model that is E-stable. The predictions of the linearized NK model about
fiscal policy at the ZLB hold in the unique interior E-stable rational expectations equilibrium of the
non-linear model.
We also study fiscal policy at the ZLB when agents are learning about the structure of the
economy. This part of the analysis is in the spirit of Lucas (1978) and Evans and Honkapohja (2001).
In particular, Lucas (1978) explored the robustness of his results under rational expectations to a
situation where agents are learning about their environment.5
The conceptual difficulty that we face in modeling learning is that, in our model, agents are learning about non-linear functions with a state variable. We call an equilibrium stable-under-learning if
the outcomes in a learning equilibrium converge to the outcomes under rational expectations. Our
key findings are: 1) the unique E-stable equilibrium is stable under learning, 2) the other minimum
state variable equilibria are not stable under learning.
In contrast to Mertens and Ravn (2014), we find that the ZLB fiscal multiplier is large in all of
our learning equilibria. The basic reason is as follows. In calculating the multiplier, Mertens and
Ravn (2014) assume that an increase in government spending is associated with a one-time adjustment of agents’ expectations.6 Specifically, agents’ expectations about inflation and consumption
5 In motivating his learning analysis, Lucas (1978) writes: “... the model described above ‘assumes’ that agents
know a great deal about the structure of the economy and perform some non-routine computations. It is in order to
ask, then: will an economy with agents armed with ‘sensible’ rules-of-thumb, revising these rules from time to time
so as to claim observed rents, tend as time passes to behave as described[...].”.
6 Brendon et al. (2015) have also considered ZLB episodes because of confidence shocks.

fall discretely so that they are close to the values that they would have in the post-shock rational
expectations equilibrium. In contrast, we do not have assume a one-time ‘jump’ in agents’ expectations when government consumption initially changes. While we think our experiment is closer in
spirit to learning literature, further research on how actual agents learn under these circumstances
is certainly warranted.
Finally, our paper assess the accuracy of linear approximations of the NK model at the ZLB. We
show that the standard log-linear approximation delivers predictions about the effects of government
spending that are qualitatively similar to those of the non-linear E-stable equilibrium. In addition,
we propose a new log-linear approximation to the ZLB equilibrium which is substantially more
accurate than the linearization used in much of the literature.
Viewed overall, our results support the view that the standard NK model does not have a
substantive uniqueness problem, at least with regards to the effects of fiscal policy at the ZLB. The
unique E-stable minimum state variable equilibrium of the non-linear NK model has properties that
are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the linear NK model.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we analyze rational expectations
equilibria at the ZLB in a nonlinear Calvo model. Section 3 contains our main results regarding Estability. In section 4 we discuss learning equilibria. Concluding remarks are contained in section 5.
Finally, the Appendix shows that our main results hold in a model with Rotemberg pricing frictions.

Fiscal Policy in the ZLB

In this section we derive the implications of the NK model for the effects of changes in government
purchases when the ZLB in binding. We conduct our analysis in a non-linear version of the NK
model in which firms face Calvo price-setting frictions.

(2)

Here, dt is the household’s rate of time discounting. As in EW, the rate of time discounting varies
over time as rt changes. EW refer to rt as the natural rate of interest. We assume that rt can take
on two values: r and r` , where r` < 0.7 The stochastic process for rt is given by

We assume that rt is known at time t. The household faces the flow budget constraint

Pt Ct + Bt ≤ (1 + Rt−1 ) Bt−1 + Wt Nt + Tt .

(4)

Here, Pt is the price of the consumption good, Bt is the quantity of risk-free nominal bonds held
by the household, Rt−1 is the gross nominal interest rate paid on bonds held from period t − 1 to
period t, Wt is the nominal wage, and Tt represents lump-sum profits net of lump-sum government
taxes and transfers.

is a subsidy that is designed to remove monopoly power distortions in a deterministic steady state

Here P̃j,t is the price chosen by monopolist j in the event that it can re-optimize its price. The
monopolist satisfies whatever demand occurs at its posted price.
The aggregate resource constraint is given by

Ct + Gt ≤ Yt .

(11)

In equilibrium, this constraint is satisfied as an equality because households and the government go
to the boundary of their budget constraints. We consider two processes for Gt . In the first, the level
of government purchases is a constant, G, independent of rt for all t. In the second

The government runs a balanced budget in each period with lump-sum taxation and monetary policy
is conducted according to an interest rate rule

Rt = max {1, 1 + r + α (πt − 1)} .

6

(12)

The max operator reflects the ZLB constraint on nominal interest rates and α is assumed to be
larger than 1 + r. As in BSGU, the latter assumption guarantees the existence of two steady states.
It is well known that Calvo pricing gives rise to dispersion in the price of intermediate goods. As
shown in Appendix A, price dispersion, p∗t , evolves according to

Moreover, aggregate output is given by

We use following baseline parameterization of the model

7.0, β = 0.99, α = 2.0, p = 0.75,

(15)

= −0.02/4, θ = 0.85, G = 0.2, χ = 1.25.

The value ε = 7 implies markups of roughly 15 percent. We set β = 0.99, which implies a steady
state real interest rate of 4 percent. The parameter α = 2 is set larger than 1 so as to satisfy the
Taylor principle. We set θ = 0.85, implying that prices are updated a little less than once per year,
on average. The parameter χ = 1.25 normalizes labor supply to be 1 in steady state, and government
spending is 20 percent of steady state output. We set p = 0.75, implying that the probability of
remaining at the ZLB in each period is 75 percent, and we set r` so that the natural rate of interest
at the ZLB is -2 percent.

At time t the model has two state variables, lagged price dispersion, p∗t−1 , and the current period

that satisfy (16)-(18) for every p∗t−1 and rt . Since the equilibrium functions depend only on p∗t−1
and rt , we have restricted ourselves to minimum-state-variable equilibria. Also since the equations
in (16) hold with strict equality, we have restricted ourselves to interior equilibria.

We use the following recursive procedure for computing equilibria. We first solve for X p∗t−1 , rt = r ,

because rt = r is an absorbing state for rt . We then use this solution to find X p∗t−1 , rt = r` . In
both cases X solves a particular fixed point problem. Consider rt = r. Given a function, X̃ (p∗t , r),
which determines aggregate prices and quantities after period t, and a value of p∗t−1 , we use (16)-(18)
to solve for Yt , πt , p∗t . By varying p∗t−1 we obtain a new function, X̄(p∗t−1 , r). This procedure defines
a mapping on the space of candidate equilibrium functions. An equilibrium, X(p∗t−1 , r), is a fixed

point of the mapping. Now consider rt = r` . Conditional on X(p∗t−1 , r), X p∗t−1 , r` is a fixed point
of another mapping defined by (16)-(18). Interiority of the equilibrium requires that consumption

and gross inflation are positive. In practice, we approximate X(p∗t−1 , r) and X p∗t−1 , r` by functions
that are piecewise linear and continuous in p∗t−1 (see the Appendix C for details).
Significantly, we find two functions X(p∗t−1 , r) that satisfy (16)-(18). That is, we find equilibria,
each of which is associated with a different steady state. Corresponding to each function X(p∗t−1 , r),

we find two functions, X p∗t−1 , r` . That is, for each X(p∗t−1 , r), we find two equilibria when the
zero lower bound is binding. So, in total we find four equilibria.

8


It is useful to discuss how the two equilibrium functions X p∗t−1 , r relate to the two steady
states discussed in BSGU. A steady-state is the 3-tuple

Y ≡ Y(p∗ , r), π ≡ π(p∗ , r), p∗ = p∗ (p∗ , r).

As in BSGU, there are two steady-state equilibria corresponding to the two solutions of equation
(17) evaluated in steady state
1
1
max (1, 1 + r + α (π − 1)) = 1
1+r
π
The solutions are π = 1 and π = 1/ (1 + r). The corresponding value of Y is computed using
equation (17).

Corresponding to each steady state, there is an equilibrium function, X p∗t−1 , r , that satisfies
(16)-(18).8 We call the function X associated with steady-state inflation π = 1 the target-inflation
equilibrium because it is associated with the target-inflation steady-state. We call the function X
associated with steady-state inflation of π = β the deflation equilibrium because it is associated
with the deflation steady state.

We now discuss our procedure for finding the two equilibrium functions, X p∗t−1 , r` , conditional

on a given X(p∗t−1 , r). In order to construction the functions X p∗t−1 , r` , it is useful to consider
how the economy would evolve if rt = r` for a very long time. As pointed out by Mertens and Ravn
(2014), in such an equilibrium, p∗t converges to a constant p∗` , where
p∗` = p∗ (p∗` , r` ).

The other equilibrium quantities converge to the constants

Y ` ≡ Y(p∗` , r` ), π ` ≡ π(p∗` , r` ).

When the system has converged, (16)-(18) consists of three equations in Y ` , π ` , and p∗` . These
8 These

two functions are distinct in the sense that there is no transition path from one steady state to the other.

equations can be collapsed into one equation in one unknown, π ` :9

f (π ` ) = 0.

(20)

For every case that we consider, there are two values of π ` which solve (20). It follows that
there are always two points to which the economy could converge if it remained at the ZLB for a
very long period of time. For each of these points of convergence, there is a corresponding function,

X p∗t−1 , r` , which we construct.
The two curves in Figure 1 display the function f (π ` ) for the two steady states. In each case
f (π ` ) has an inverted ‘U’ shape and there are two points to which inflation could converge if rt = r`
for many periods.

Baseline Fiscal Multiplier Results

In this sub-section, we consider the following experiment. At time t = 0 the economy is in a
nonstochastic steady state for r0 = r and π0 = p∗0 = 1. Consistent with (3), agents assign zero
probability to a change in rt . In period t = 1, r1 = r` . Afterward, rt evolves according to (3).
For now, we assume that the economy will return to the target inflation steady state after rt = r.
The solid and dashed lines in each panel of Figure 2 display the dynamic path of inflation and
consumption in the two rational expectations equilibria when rt = r` . Given our assumptions, the
ZLB is binding.
A number of features of these equilibria are worth noting. First, in one equilibrium, quarterly
inflation and consumption drop in the impact period of the shock by roughly 1.5 and 5.1 percentage
points, respectively. After about 5 quarters these declines stabilize at 1.3 and 5 percentage points,
respectively. We refer to this equilibrium as the relatively-good equilibrium. Second, in the other
equilibrium, quarterly inflation and consumption drop in the impact period of the shock by 6.8 and
17.5 percentage points, respectively. After about 5 quarters these declines stabilize at 5.5 and 17.3
percentage points, respectively. We refer to this equilibrium as the relatively-bad equilibrium. Third,
the dynamics induced by the evolving state variable p∗t are larger, the larger is the drop in inflation.
In both equilibria, p∗t , Ct , and πt effectively converge to constants after roughly a year.
To derive values for the multiplier we assume that G` = 1.05 × G, i.e. when rt = r` , G rises by

1 percent of steady state output. We define the multiplier to be
∆Ct + 0.05G
.
0.05G
Here, the ∆ refers to the difference between outcomes when government purchases are G` and the
ZLB and when government purchases are G at the ZLB. We compute the multiplier assuming that if
the economy is in the relatively good equilibrium then it is in the relatively good equilibrium when
government purchases are higher. We make the symmetric assumption for the other equilibrium.10
The two panels of Figure 3 display the multiplier in the two equilibria at the ZLB as a function of
time. Notice that the multiplier in the relatively good ZLB equilibrium is large, exceeding two over
the time period displayed. In contrast, the multiplier is actually negative in the relatively-bad ZLB
equilibrium. To understand why the multiplier depends on the equilibrium, note that an increase in
G` shifts f upwards (see Figure 4). This shift implies that the effect of an increase in G depends on
which equilibrium we consider. At the relatively-bad equilibrium (the crossing to the left), inflation
falls. That decline induces a rise the real interest rate and a fall in consumption. At the relativelygood equilibrium (the crossing to the right), inflation rises. That rise induces a decline in the real
interest rate and an increase in consumption.
In the analysis above, the ZLB becomes binding because of a shock to the household’s discount
rate. In Appendix B we suppose, as in Mertens and Ravn (2015), that the ZLB binds because of a
10 This assumption is non-trivial because one can easily construct examples in which G serves as a sunspot inducing
a switch from one equilibrium to the other. As in Mertens and Ravn (2014), we abstract from this issue.

E-Stability at the ZLB

In this section, we investigate whether or not rational expectations equilibria at the ZLB are E-stable.
This section is organized as follows. In the subsection 3.1, we restate the model in terms of general
beliefs, rather than imposing rational expectations. In the subsection 3.2, we define E-stability for
a non-linear model and show that only the relatively good ZLB equilibrium that returns to the
target-inflation steady state is E-stable. In subsection 3.3, we analyze the relationship between our
E-stability results and those that obtain in a log-linear version of the NK model. We propose a new
log-linearization that turns out to be more accurate than the traditional one used in the literature.
Finally, in section 3.4 we investigate the magnitude of the fiscal multiplier in the non-linear model
and in linearized versions of the model.

Beliefs

To solve agents problems, we must attribute to them beliefs about all relevant aggregate variables.11
We assume that households and firms enter the period with the same beliefs.

current values of these variables are a function of firms’ collective time-t decisions. So firms cannot
actually observe these variables when they choose p̃t . The standard assumption is that firms form
a “belief” about these variables, based on state variables and contemporaneous shocks, when they
make their decisions. In a rational expectations equilibrium that belief is correct. In a world where
firms do not necessarily have rational expectations it is not natural to assume that firms see the
current values of aggregate variables when they choose prices.
Households observe the current-period wage when they supply labor and know the current-period
inflation rate when they purchase consumption goods. In addition, they know their own discount
rate, rt . They form time-t beliefs about aggregate inflation in the next period, π e,t+1 (p∗t , rt+1 ). This
notation reflects that, in contrast to firms, households know πt and p∗t when forming expectations
11 Under rational expectations, intermediate good firms choose their price level, P̃ , based on the current and
t
expected values of aggregate output, consumption, and inflation. The current values of these variables are a function
firms’ collective time t decisions. So firms cannot actually observe these variables when they choose P̃t . The standard
assumption is that when firms make their time-t decisions, they form ‘beliefs’ about these variables, based on the
values of the time-t state variables and realizations of the shocks. In a rational expectations equilibrium those beliefs
are correct. If firms do not have rational expectations it is not natural to assume that they see the current values of
aggregate variables when they choose their prices.

In their analysis of learning in an infinite-horizon model, studies like Preston (2005) use the
household’s lifetime budget constraint in conjunction with the household’s first-order conditions to
expression consumption as a function of current and future aggregate variables. This strategy is
feasible with log-linear versions of the model. But, as far as we know, those strategies do not work
in our non-linear setting.12

3.2

E-stability in the non-linear model

E-stability, as defined by Evans and Honkapohja (2001), is a relationship between the parameters
characterizing beliefs and the parameters characterizing outcomes. Loosely speaking, E-stability
implies that small deviations from parameters that characterize rational expectations beliefs induce
smaller deviations in the parameters that characterize equilibrium outcomes. In non-linear models
with state variables, rational expectations equilibrium beliefs cannot be exactly characterized by a
finite number of parameters. However, these beliefs can be well-approximated with a finite number
of parameters (see Judd (1998)). We use this fact to when assessing the E-stability of equilibria in
our non-linear model.
Recall that the aggregate state variables in the economy are p∗t−1 and rt . We assume that,
conditional on rt , firms’ beliefs are formed using a finite-elements approximation on a fine grid over
p∗t−1 . This finite-elements approximation is on the same grid that we use to solve for the rational
expectations equilibria.
We define a rational expectations equilibrium as a set of functions Yt = Y(p∗t−1 , rt ; Ψ) and πt =
12 Of

course, in our analysis the household’s per-period budget constraint holds at every date and for every state.

15

π(p∗t−1 , rt ; Ψ) that solve (3.2) and (3.3) at all of the grid points in our finite-elements approximation.
With N grid points, the procedure yields an N -vector of parameters, Ψ, that characterize the rational
expectations equilibrium.
Denote the vector of parameters characterizing agents’ beliefs about the perceived equilibrium
laws of motion (PLM) by ΨP LM . Conditional on those beliefs, the actual law of motion (ALM)
is defined by the resulting outcomes for aggregate variables, as determined by equations (21)-(23).
Denote by ΨALM the vector of parameters characterizing the finite-elements approximation to the
outcomes for aggregate variables. The model defines a mapping from ΨP LM to ΨALM , given by

ΨALM = T (ΨP LM ).

(25)

Evans and Honkapohja (2001)define an equilibrium to be E-stable if the real parts of the eigenvalues of

∂T (Ψ)
∂Ψ

are negative. The idea is that small perturbations of beliefs from an E-stable equilibrium

induce dynamics that push the system back to the initial equilibrium.
Based on this definition, we investigate the E-stability of the four rational expectations equilibria
in our model. We compute

∂T (Ψ)
∂Ψ

for the parameters of our finite-elements approximation. Our

results can be characterized as follows. First, as in McCallum (2009), the negative-inflation steady
state equilibrium is not E-stable. So, the two ZLB equilibria that converge to the negative inflation
steady state after rt = r are not E-stable. Second, the relatively bad ZLB equilibrium that converges
to the intended steady after rt = r is not E-stable. Third, the relatively good ZLB equilibrium that
converges to the intended steady after rt = r is E-stable. So, there is a unique (interior minimum
state variable) rational expectations equilibrium.
Recall, above we established that the qualitative properties of fiscal policy in the E-stable equilibrium are the same as those stressed in literature based on the log-linearized NK model (see, for
example, Christiano et al. (2011)). Taken together, this result and our E-stability results make
concrete our claim that non-uniqueness in the NK model is not a substantive problem at least as
regards fiscal policy.

3.3

Analyzing E-stability using a linearized version of the model

To provide further insight into the results of the results of section 3.2, it is useful to focus on the
limit points of a ZLB equilibrium, assuming rt = r` for a long time. The advantage of doing so

16

is that we can work with linear approximations to the model, where the point of approximation is
taken around the limit point.13 Note that p∗t 6= 1 at the limit point in the ZLB. So this linearization
maintains the dependence of aggregate variables on p̂∗t . Approximating around that point seems
reasonable given the relative speed with which the system converges in the ZLB. In fact, equilibrium
quantities and prices converge to this limit point after about one year (see Figure 2). When rt = r,
we linearize the model around the target-inflation steady state.
We denote log-deviations from steady-state values by x̂t . The equilibrium of the linearized model
when rt = r is characterized by a set of coefficients γx , so that
x̂t = γx p̂∗t−1

(26)

for each of the endogenous variables. Normally the dependence of x̂t on p̂∗t−1 is ignored in the
linearized Calvo model. The rationale is that p̂∗t−1 depends only on its own lagged value, so that if
the system starts in steady state, p̂∗t−1 is identically equal to zero. This assumption does not make
sense in our context because p̂∗t−1 will not be equal to zero once the system has been in the ZLB. So
it makes sense to maintain the dependence of x̂t on p̂∗t−1 when analyzing how the system returns to
steady state after the ZLB episode is over.
When rt = r` , we linearize the equilibrium conditions around a limit point in the ZLB. We
denote log-deviations of the endogenous variables from their value at that limit point by x̂`t . At the
limit point, p∗t−1 is a constant that is less than 1. So, when rt reverts to r, p̂∗t−1 has a non-zero value.
This makes clear why, in (26), x̂t is a function of p̂∗t .
When the equilibrium conditions are linearized around the relatively good ZLB equilibrium, the
linearized system has a unique bounded rational expectations equilibrium. It is also E-stable. It
follows from Evans and Honkapohja (2001) that the equilibrium therefore stable under adaptive
and least squares learning. When the equilibrium conditions are linearized around the relatively
bad ZLB equilibrium, the linearized system is indeterminate in the sense of Blanchard and Khan
and not E-stable. In this way, the E-stability of the non-linear equilibria are closely related to the
determinacy of the linearized equilibria.
13 Linear approximations have the added advantage that they do not require numerical approximation to the equilibrium laws of motion for the linearized equilibrium conditions.

Multipliers in the linear and non-linear model

In this sub-section, we compare the size of the fiscal multiplier in the non-linear and linear models.
Table 1 reports the multiplier in the non-linear model the standard log-linearized model and our
log-linearized model. In the latter case, the multiplier is reported for the linearization around the
point for which the equilibrium is determinate.
Two key results are worth noting. First, the multipliers in the linearized models are similar to
the multiplier in the relatively good equilibrium of the non-linear model. Indeed, for our preferred
linearization, the multipliers are nearly identical. Second, in stark contrast, the multiplier at the
relatively bad ZLB equilibrium of the nonlinear model is very different than the multipliers in the
linear models. These results make concrete our claim that multiplicity in the NK model is not a
substantive problem, at least regarding fiscal policy, because the results from the linearized models
are qualitatively similar to the results at the relatively good ZLB equilibrium, which is E-stable.

Stability Under Learning at the ZLB

In this section we investigate stability under learning of equilibria at the ZLB in the non-linear model.
In addition we assess whether the qualitative results of the standard linear NK model continue to
hold in the non-linear learning model.

4.1

The Learning Algorithm

An important question in a nonlinear environment is: how do agents learn about nonlinear equilibrium functions mapping the state of the economy to aggregate prices and quantities? We follow
Chen and White (1998) and assume that households and firms learn about equilibrium functions
using a recursive non-parametric learning scheme. A virtue of this scheme is that agents do not have
to know the precise functional forms of the equilibrium mappings.

18

Specifically, we assume that when the ZLB is binding, households and firms update their beliefs
about consumption and inflation according to

Here, the kernel K is the normal density function and the bandwidth bt is a sequence of positive
numbers that decreases to zero as t → ∞. As in Chen and White (1998), we assume that bt is of


−δ
order O (t + 1)
for some 0 < δ < 41 . Chen and White (1998) make this assumption to ensure
that beliefs that are updated using their non-parametric learning algorithm they propose converges
to rational expectations beliefs in a stochastic environment.14
According to equations (27) and (28), agents update their beliefs using what amounts to a nonparametric estimator of the equilibrium mapping. A key feature of the learning algorithm is that
when agents see a new value of consumption and inflation, they disproportionately update their
beliefs about the equilibrium functions in an area around p∗t−1 . The kernel density and bandwidth
must meet certain regularity condition so that beliefs converge over time. The presence of the
(t + 1)−1 term implies that over time agents give less weight to new observations. The bt term
controls the rate at which future observations get less weight. The term [(t + 1)bt ]−1 goes to zero
as t → ∞, although less quickly than (t + 1)−1 . Notice in the kernel, x − p∗t−1 is divided by bt . So,
as the bandwidth goes to zero, agents are less willing to update their beliefs about the equilibrium
mappings for values of p∗t−1 that are far away from the current realization.
Unlike Chen and White (1998), we are not working with a model that is stationary and ergodic.
To see this, note that the state in which the ZLB is no longer binding is an absorbing state. So
agents only observe one sequence of consumption and inflation corresponding to a particular sequence of p∗t−1 , at the ZLB.15 It follows that beliefs in a learning equilibrium can’t converge to the
rational expectations beliefs for all values of p∗t−1 . For this reason, we adopt a more-limited notion
of stability under learning that is more-applicable to EW equilibria. Specifically, we say that a
rational expectations equilibrium is stable under learning if the values of inflation and consumption
practice, we assume bt = t+100
(t + 1)−0.24 .

example, we assume that a particular value of p∗t−1 at the beginning of the ZLB episode, so agents are only
going to learn about the properties of the ZLB starting from that point.

4.2

Results

In what follows, we imagine that the economy is initially in the target-inflation steady state. Then,
rt drops to r` and obeys the law of motion given by (3). Agents have to learn about consumption
and inflation evolve when rt = r` . We establish four key results. First, the relatively good ZLB
equilibrium is stable under learning in the sense defined above. Second, the key results from the
standard log-linear NK model carry over to the learning environment. Specifically, the multiplier is
much bigger when the ZLB constraint is binding compared to when it is not. Third, the relatively
bad ZLB equilibrium is not stable under learning. Fourth, the multiplier in the ZLB is large even
when agents’ beliefs are begin near the relatively bad ZLB equilibrium.
Throughout, we characterize agents’ beliefs by a finite elements approximation on the grid for
p∗t−1 that we use to calculate the rational expectations equilibria. Agents update their expectations according to (27) and (28), where these equations are evaluated at each grid point. In our
initial experiment, we assume that agents’ initial beliefs are equal to the mappings for the rational
expectations equilibrium that converges to target-inflation steady state. Agents also think that,
in the post-ZLB period, when rt = r, the equilibrium laws of motion correspond to the rational
expectations equilibrium that eventually converges to the target-inflation steady state.16 These assumptions are reasonable given the E-stability of the target-inflation steady state equilibrium, and
the presumption that rt = r` is a relatively rare event.
The purple solid lines in Figure 5 display the paths of consumption and inflation in the learning
equilibrium, assuming no change in government spending. The corresponding rational expectations
equilibrium paths are given by the blue dashed lines. Notice that, in the learning equilibrium,
consumption and inflation converge from above to their limiting values in the relatively good ZLB
equilibrium. Significantly, the ZLB is not binding in the first few periods because inflation is relatively high as a result of agents initially high inflation expectations. In those periods, the Taylor
rule calls for a non-negative interest rate. After 3 periods, the ZLB becomes binding. As expectations about inflation and consumption adjust downward in response to low realized outcomes, actual

negative inflation steady state when rt = r. We find similar results.

inflation and consumption decline.
The top panel of Figure 6 displays the value of the multiplier in the learning equilibrium. We
calculate the multiplier assuming that Gt increases by 1 percent of steady state output for as long
as long as rt = r` . After the ZLB binds, the multiplier rises above 1 and then converges to its value
in the corresponding rational expectations equilibrium.17
It is instructive to consider an analogous experiment, but where r` = r and the ZLB does not
bind. That is, in period 0, G increases. When G increases, agents also think that it will revert
to its steady state value with probability 1 − p.18 After G reverts to its steady state value, agent
believe that the equilibrium laws of motion correspond to the rational expectations equilibrium that
eventually converges to the target-inflation steady state. We assume that agents’ initial beliefs about
consumption and inflation are equal to the mappings for the rational expectations equilibrium that
converges to target-inflation steady state. The bottom panel of Figure 6 displays the value of the
multiplier in the learning equilibrium for this case. Notice that the multiplier is lower than 1, and
quickly converges to its value in the corresponding rational expectations equilibrium.
We now re-do the ZLB experiment assuming that initial beliefs about the equilibrium mapping
for consumption and inflation are slightly higher than their relatively bad ZLB equilibrium values.
The top two panels of Figure 7 are the analogue of Figure 5. Notice that consumption and inflation
diverge from the limit points in the relatively bad ZLB equilibrium. Indeed, after many periods, they
converge to the limit points of the relatively good ZLB equilibrium.19 The purple solid line in the
bottom panel of Figure 7 displays the multiplier in the learning equilibrium. The blue dashed line
displays the multiplier in the relatively bad ZLB equilibrium. Note the multiplier is initially about 1.
Then, reflecting relatively high inflation rates, the multiplier becomes very large.20 These properties
contrast sharply with the properties of the multiplier in the corresponding rational expectations
equilibrium.
We conclude that for all of the different learning equilibria that we consider, the multiplier is large
when the ZLB binds. Moreover, the multiplier is relatively small when the ZLB is not binding. These
results are qualitatively very similar to the results that we obtain in E-stable rational expectations
17 The

value of the multiplier is initially low because the ZLB isn’t binding in the first few periods.
these equilibria, we assume that beliefs are such that the ZLB does not bind. This is in contrast to the
assumption we make in Appendix B.
19 If we re-do the experiment assuming that the initial beliefs about consumption and inflation are lower than the
relatively bad ZLB equilibrium values, the outcomes for inflation and consumption diverge toward zero.
20 Eventually the multiplier converges from above to its value in the limiting point of the relatively good ZLB
equilibrium.

4.3

Reconciling with Mertens and Ravn (2014)

Mertens and Ravn (2014) report that the fiscal multiplier is small in a learning equilibrium. In their
experiment, agents’ initial beliefs are near a rational expectations equilibrium that is analogous
to our relatively bad ZLB equilibrium. Their result contrasts sharply with our finding that the
multiplier is large when we begin with beliefs that are near the relatively bad ZLB equilibrium.
There are three differences our analyses. First, they work with a linearized Calvo model when
they study the learning equilibrium. Second, they assume that when firms choose prices, they see
the contemporaneous aggregate price level. Third, the experiment that underlies their multiplier
calculation is subtly different than ours. When we calculate the multiplier, we assume agents’ initial
expectations about consumption and inflation are the same regardless of the value of G. Recall that
in the relatively bad ZLB equilibrium, inflation actually falls by π when G increases. Similarly,
Ct falls by C . When Mertens and Ravn (2014) initially raise G in a learning equilibrium, they
simultaneously decrease agents’ expectations of inflation by π and consumption by C . Consistent
with the analysis above, this fall in inflation expectations would in and of itself reduce output in the
ZLB.
It turns out that the first two differences between our analysis and that of Mertens and Ravn
(2014) do not have a large impact on the multiplier. In contrast the third difference is very important.
Figure 8 displays the multiplier if we adopt the assumption in Mertens and Ravn (2014) about how
expectations about inflation change when G increases. Notice that that the multiplier is negative
for roughly 3 years. In this example, the initial drop in inflation expectations is quantitatively much
more important than the increase in G.

Conclusion

In this paper we analyze whether non-uniqueness of equilibria poses a substantive challenge to the
key conclusions of NK models about the efficacy of fiscal policy in the ZLB. We argue that it does
not. This conclusion rests on our view that if a rational expectations equilibrium is not E-stable
or stable under learning, then it is simply too fragile to be a description of the data. We have also

argued that the key properties of linear and non-linear models are very similar. Indeed, under our
proposed new way of linearizing the NK model in the ZLB, the quantitative value of the multiplier
is very similar in the linear and non-linear model.
To asses stability under learning, we adopted a particular model of learning. It is certainly
possible that there exist some models of how agents learn for which our results would not hold.
Exploring stability under learning under alternative plausible learning models is an important avenue
for future research.

The aggregate resource constraint is

Alternatively, the equations can be simplified to (16)-(18).

A.1

Target-inflation steady state

The intended steady state can be found as follows. Normalize N = 1 and assume that G/Y = 0.2.
In steady state,π = 1 (R = 1), so p∗ = 1, p̃ = 1, and Y = 1. From the resource constraint, C = 0.8.
Firm optimality implies K = F , meaning that s = 1. We can then get χ from the intratemporal

32

Euler equation.

A.2

Linearization away from ZLB

We linearize the model around the target-inflation steady state. Denote the log deviation of a
variable from steady state by x̂t . The log-linear equations are

Standard linearization at the ZLB

As is Carlstrom et al. (2014), as well as CER, the linearizaiton at the ZLB starts with the following
two equations

Note that p̂∗t is ignored. Also, we have used that Rt = 1 + rt = β −1 in steady state. After the
ZLB, it is assumed that Ĉt = Ĝt = π̂t = 0 because there are no state variables. At the ZLB, these
equations become

Similar to Carlestrom, et al. (2014), the full set of solutions is given by

ˆ t = π̂ ` + a1 λt1 + a2 λt2
pi

where a1 and a2 are arbitrary constants,
π̂ ` =

κβ(2 − ηG )r` + κηG (1 − p) Et Ĝ`

and
∆ = (1 − p)(1 − βp) − p(2 − ηG )κ.

35

The values λ1 and λ2 are the solutions to
1 − (β + 1 + (2 − ηG )κ) pλ + βp2 λ2 = 0.

Let
z (λ) ≡

1
+ βp2 λ.
λ

We seek values of λ so that z(λ) = (β + 1 + (2 − ηG )κ) p. The function f achieves a minimum at
r
λ=

1
> 1.
βp2

Note that
z(1) = 1 + βp2 = ∆ + (β + 1 + (2 − ηG )κ) p
Both values of λ exceed unity if, and only if, z(1) > (β + 1 + (2 − ηG )κ) p, which is equivalent to

∆ > 0.

If both roots exceed unity, then a1 = a2 = 0 gives the unique bounded solution. We focus on this
case. We then have the following proposition.
Proposition 1. There is a unique non-explosive solution to the linearized system of equations at
the ZLB if an only if ∆ > 0.
Note that if ∆ < 0, then inflation rises as r` falls and the system is pushed away from the ZLB.
The linearization predicts that at the ZLB, the drop in output is given by

Now, note that for the purposes of our linearization, we are going to linearize around the limit point
at the ZLB when the ZLB is binding and around the point to which the system will jump when the

Sunspot equilibria

Here, we assume that rt never changes. Instead, we assume that there is a sunspot that take
value 1 at time t = 1. With probability p, the sunspot remains at the value 1. With complementary
probability, the sunspot takes the value 0 and remains at that value forever. Figure 10 is analogous to

Figure 4 in the main text. Again, an increase in G shifts f π ` up. Because the sunspot equilibrium
is the left crossing, inflation declines, causing real interest rates to rise, and consumption to fall.
The multiplier in the sunspot equilibrium is about 0.91.

Details about non-linear approximations

We approximate equilibrium laws of motion for prices and quantities in the nonlinear NK model using
a finite-elements method. In particular, we define a grid on p∗t−1 that spans 0.8 to 1 and contains
at least the 2001 points at each increment 0.0001. At each grid point, we assign a parameter value
that characterizes equilibrium law of motion for the relevant aggregate variable if p∗t−1 is equal to
the grid point. Between grid points, we linearly interpolate the values at the two closes points.

Rotember-style adjustment costs

rather than Calvo-style adjustment costs.

D.2

Steady states

The target-inflation steady state of the model is identical to the Calvo model because in both steady
states there is no inflation. The negative-inflation steady state can be easily solved for by setting
π = β and computing C from the resource constraint.

D.3

Equilibrium in the nonlinear model

In an EW equilibrium, consumption and inflation jump to their steady state values after the ZLB
no longer binds. We initially focus on the target-inflation steady state. We consider the same value
for rt we consider in the Calvo model. We look for a minimum-state, interior equilibrium. Thus,
we look for two numbers, C ` and π ` . The monetary policy rule divides the candidate inflation rates
into a subinterval in which the ZLB is binding and a second one in which it is not. Define

Note that C ` is increasing on the interval from πLB

nominal interest rate is fixed.
Non-negativity of C ` also implies an upper bound on π ` . To see this, solve for C ` using the

intertemporal Euler equation for π ` > πZLB
to get

If no such π ` exists, there is no EW equilibrium.
A similar set of conditions can be derived using the negative-inflation steady state. Note that
the function f in the Rotemberg model is analogous to the function f in the Calvo model. The
difference is that in the Calvo model the function f relates to the limit point in the ZLB, while in
the Rotemberg model the function f relates to the equilibrium values.
Figure 11 is the analogue of Figure 1, but using our Rotemberg model. Similar to the Calvo
model, the relatively-good ZLB equilibrium shifts left when the post-ZLB steady state will be the
deflation steady state.
Figure 12 is the analogue of Figure 4, but using our Rotemberg model instead of our Calvo
model.

Because we know the entire possible support of π ` , we can be sure that the only solutions to the
model at the ZLB are those displayed in the figures.

Linearization

The only equation that needs to be altered relative to the Clavo model is the pricing equation from
the monopolists. When we linearize the pricing equation around steady state, we get

where πj,t ≡ Pj,t /Pj,t−1 . Because rt is the only state variable, when rt = r` , it is natural to assume
that firms believe that they will set their inflation rate tomorrow equal to the value they set today.
This assumption is true in a rational expectations equilibrium, but not necessarily in a learning
equilibrium. Further, it is natural to assume that firms believe that consumption will be the same
value in each period that rt = r` . Under these assumptions, and further assuming that the economy
returns to the target-inflation steady state when rt = r` , the first-order condition of the firm becomes

Households see current inflation. It is natural for households to assume that inflation in the next

relatively-good ZLB equilibrium is E-stable. The relatively-bad ZLB equilibrium is not E-stable.
We next compute a learning equilibrium. We assume that πt`e = πt−1 . That is, firms expect
inflation to be what it was in the previous period. Consistent with this rule, we assume that
the eocnomy had been in steady state and firms initially believe that πt = 1. The outcomes for
consumption, inflation, and the government purchases multiplier are shown in Figure 13. Note that
the outcomes eventually converges to the values in the relatively-good ZLB rational expectations
equilibrium.

We again assume that expectations are updated so that agents think tomorrow’s values will be the
same as yesterday’s values. In this case, we also find that only the relatively-good ZLB equilibrium
is E-stable. This form of learning is slower than the other form of learning we consider in the
Rotemberg model. Figure 14 shows the equilibrium outcomes.
