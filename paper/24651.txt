Effects of Access to Legal Same-Sex Marriage on Marriage and Health: Evidence from BRFSS

ABSTRACT
We exploit variation in access to legal same-sex marriage (SSM) across states and time to provide
novel evidence of its effects on marriage and health using data from the CDC BRFSS from
2000-2016, a period spanning the entire rollout of legal SSM across the United States. Our main
approach is to relate changes in outcomes for individuals in same-sex households (SSH) [i.e.,
households with exactly two same-sex adults], which we show includes a substantial share of gay
and lesbian couples, coincident with adoption of legal SSM in two-way fixed effects models. We
find robust evidence that access to legal SSM significantly increased marriage take-up among
men and women in SSH. We also find that legal SSM was associated with significant increases
in health insurance, access to care, and utilization for men in SSH. Our results provide the first
evidence that legal access to SSM improved health for adult gay men.

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

1. Introduction
Advancements in civil rights for and changes in social attitudes about lesbian,
gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals in the United States represent
some of the most striking social changes in recent decades. In the policy arena
these shifts have been reflected in a major Supreme Court ruling in 2015,
Obergefell v. Hodges, which effectively legalized same-sex marriage (SSM) in
the eyes of the federal government throughout the US. Prior to Obergefell,
however, a series of state-level court rulings and legislative actions dating back to
a 2004 court case in Massachusetts created a complex legal patchwork of access
to legal SSM across space and time, such that nine states adopted same-sex
marriage without the associated federal rights and responsibilities (such as equal
tax treatment, immigration rights, and others). A June 2013 Supreme Court ruling
in United States v. Windsor gave federal marriage recognition to same-sex
couples that wed in states with legal recognition but did not require other states to
recognize those marriages. This uncertain legal landscape was exacerbated as
more states adopted marriage equality in late 2013 and throughout 2014 until
nationwide legal access to federally recognized same-sex marriage was granted in
June 2015 with the Obergefell ruling (see Figure 1).
Despite the strong theoretical possibility that these fundamental changes in
access to marriage had meaningful effects on the lives of sexual minorities, we
know strikingly little about how these policies affected outcomes.

1

This

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

knowledge gap is due primarily to data limitations: very few datasets include
information that could plausibly identify gay men, lesbians, and bisexual
individuals, and most of the small number of datasets that do include sexual
orientation information did not pre-date legal access to SSM, thus precluding
most gold-standard quasi-experimental approaches to study this research question.
A handful of studies have examined how legal access to SSM has affected
population-wide health outcomes such as sexually transmitted infections or youth
suicide ideation and attempt, but little work has studied outcomes such as direct
take-up of marriage, health insurance, healthcare access, and health.
In this paper we provide new evidence on these questions by using data
from the 2000-2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and
exploiting spatial and temporal variation in access to legal SSM induced by state
and federal court rulings and legislative activity. The BRFSS did not include
direct questions about sexual orientation over most of our sample period, so our
analysis relies on a novel method for indirectly identifying a sample that is most
likely to be directly affected by legal SSM. Specifically, we follow previous
BRFSS-based research that makes use of information on the sex composition of
adults in the household – which is ascertained in the household screener portion
of the survey – to identify a sample that is likely to contain a nontrivial share of
gay and lesbian couples. That is, we identify a treatment group composed of
individuals who report exactly two same-sex adults in the household and exactly

2

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

zero different-sex adults in the household.

Through a variety of direct and

indirect measures, we estimate that 11-28 percent of individuals in households
with exactly two same-sex adults are likely to be sexual minorities.

For

individuals in this household structure who also report being married, the relevant
share is even higher: 46-60 percent.
We also make use of individuals in other household configurations as
plausible falsification samples. For example, we estimate that about 99 percent of
individuals who report exactly one male adult and one female adult in the
household are heterosexual (most of whom are likely to be straight couples). The
key advantage and innovation of our measurement approach is that it allows us to
identify a meaningful sample size of ‘same-sex male adult’ and ‘same-sex female
adult’ households that pre-dates all of the policy variation in legal access to SSM
in a dataset that includes key family structure and health-related outcomes that
have not previously been studied in this literature. This allows us to consider new
and important health outcomes while at the same time properly addressing issues
of causal inference.

We also address several potential concerns with our

approach, including the possibility that household structure itself (i.e., the
probability of observing any household with exactly two adults or exactly two
same-sex adults) could be endogenously related to legal access to SSM, and we
show that this is not pervasive.

3

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

Our main empirical approach is a standard difference-in-differences (DD)
model that examines the sample of individuals in same-sex households and
leverages state variation in the timing of legal access to SSM with state and time
fixed effects, controlling also for individual characteristics and other aspects of
the policy environment toward sexual minorities (e.g., nondiscrimination laws,
domestic partner/civil union laws, state bans on same-sex marriage, and others).
The DD model assumes that these outcomes for individuals in same-sex
households would have trended similarly in states with and without legal access to
SSM in the absence of the change in legal regime. We first focus directly on
marriage take-up, and we then consider a range of health-related outcomes,
including having any health insurance plan, having a regular doctor, having a
checkup in the past year, having unmet medical needs due to cost, self-rated
health, bad physical and mental health days, substance use, and preventive care
utilization.
We report several core findings from this research. First, legal access to
SSM is not meaningfully associated with living arrangements in the population,
suggesting that our focus on individuals in same-sex households is unlikely to be
biased by composition effects. Second, we find clear evidence that legal access to
same-sex marriage in one’s state is associated with a statistically significant
increase in the likelihood that an individual in a same-sex household reports being
married, an effect on the order of 79 and 41 percent relative to the pre-reform

4

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

mean for women and men, respectively. This effect is highly robust to various
sample and model specification choices and obtains significance only after
adoption of legal same-sex marriage in an event-study framework. It is also
unique to individuals in same-sex households: that is, it is not meaningfully
observed in the falsification sample of households with one man and one woman.
Third, we find that legal access to SSM in one’s state is associated with
statistically significant increases in the probability of having health insurance,
reporting a usual source of care, and having a checkup in the past year for men
(but not women) in same-sex households. Finally, we find no systematic effects
of legal access to same-sex marriage on unmet medical needs, physical or mental
health, substance use, or preventive care utilization for men or women in samesex households. Overall our results using a novel measurement strategy provide
the most comprehensive evidence to date that legal access to SSM significantly
increased marriage take-up for gay and lesbian couples and also significantly
improved healthcare access and utilization for adult gay men in same-sex
households.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the
mechanisms through which legal access to same-sex marriage could affect
marriage and health-related outcomes and reviews the literature on policy
determinants of marriage and on the effects of marriage on health. It also reviews
a small and emerging literature on the effects of access to legal SSM. Section 3

5

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

then describes the data and outlines our empirical approach. Section 4 presents
the results, and Section 5 offers a discussion and concludes.

2. Mechanisms and Previous Literature
2.1 Literature on the policy determinants of marriage
This paper contributes to a large literature on the policy determinants of marriage.
Scholars have demonstrated the empirical significance of the tax-cost of marriage
(Alm and Whittington 1999), unilateral divorce laws (e.g., Peters 1986, Friedberg
1998, Wolfers 2006), blood test requirements (Buckles et al. 2011), and minimum
age requirements (Blank et al. 2009) on different-sex marriage rates. Our paper
adds to those literatures by studying a much more direct change to the overall cost
of getting married – access to the legal institution for same-sex couples – than has
been typically studied. In this sense, our work is related to prior studies of antimiscegenation statutes and the effects of Loving v. Virginia on interracial
marriage (Fryer 2007, Gevrek 2014).
2.2 Literature on the effects of legal access to same-sex marriage on marriage
take-up
A handful of studies in economics and demography have specifically documented
how legal access to same-sex marriage affected family formation outcomes,

6

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

including take-up of marriage by sexual minorities.

1

Carpenter (2018,

forthcoming) examines the experience of Massachusetts’ legalization of same-sex
marriage through the state Supreme Court in 2004 using data from the
Massachusetts BRFSS and finds that it significantly increased marriage take-up
by lesbians and gay men, with larger effects for lesbians. Some research has also
examined how same-sex marriage policies – including bans on same-sex marriage
– affected heterosexual individuals.

Trandafir (2014) finds no relationship

between the adoption of legal same-sex marriage in the Netherlands in 2001 and
rates of different-sex marriage.

Trandafir (2015) examines relationship

recognition in a larger sample of countries for the period 1980-2009 and finds that
legal same-sex marriage did not affect family formation (as measured by
marriage, divorce, and extramarital births) for different-sex couples. Langbein
and Yost (2009) study the US context through 2004 and find that same-sex
relationship policies have no effects on different-sex marriage, divorce, and
abortion rates or on the percentage of children born out of wedlock; Dillender
(2015) finds a similar null result using more recent data and focusing on marriage
rates (i.e., flows instead of stocks).
2.3 Literature on the relationship between marriage and health

We do not review here studies in economics that have addressed the tax consequences of
legalizing same-sex marriage (Alm et al. 2014, Fisher et al. 2016), including potentially important
effects on labor supply and employment (Isaac 2017).

1

7

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

By examining health outcomes, our study also contributes to a large literature in
economics, sociology, psychology, and demography on the effects of marriage on
health. This literature is summarized elsewhere (see, for example, Ross et al.
1990, Waite and Lehrer 2003, Wood et al. 2007), but several specific findings
merit mention. Marriage is the primary social relationship for half of American
adults (U.S. Census Bureau 2016), and is consistently linked to lower risk of
death from various causes, higher survival rates from diseases like cancer, and
better physical and mental health (Aizer et al. 2013; Goodwin et al. 1987; Hu and
Goldman 1990; Lillard and Waite 1995; Sorlie et al. 1995; Trovato and Lauris
1989). Conversely, mortality risks are highest for the never married (Hu and
Goldman 1990; Lillard and Waite 1995; Sorlie et al. 1995), and multiple studies
observe physical and mental health penalties as a result of the loss of a spouse
(Lillard and Waite 1995; Kapiro et al. 1987; Stroebe and Stroebe 1987).
Certainly, not all marriages are equally beneficial.

Recent studies

examining the heterogeneity of effects on health across marriages find that marital
quality is an important mediator of the effects of marital status on health
(Williams 2003), especially in older age (Umberson et al. 2006). Marriage is also
less beneficial for women compared to men in different-sex couples, and for
nonwhites compared to whites (see for review Kiecolt-Glaser and Newton 2001;
Ross et al. 1990). Prior to the widespread legalization of marriage for same-sex
couples, the lack of legal and social recognition of same-sex couples was

8

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

associated with poorer mental health outcomes (Herdt and Kertzner 2006). At the
same time, legal same-sex relationships have been shown to be associated with
more positive mental health outcomes and less psychological distress for
individuals in same-sex couples (Riggle et al. 2010, Wight et al. 2013).
2.4 Mechanisms through which marriage affects health
There are multiple direct and indirect mechanisms through which marriage has
been theorized to produce individual health effects. Healthier individuals have
been theorized to select into marriage and to be more likely to stay married,
although prospective studies following young adults as they select into marriage
find limited evidence of selection effects (e.g., Waldron et al. 1996). Marriage
may also confer protective effects on health.

These protective effects are

theorized to operate primarily via the provision of physical, financial, and
emotional support by a spouse (Ducharme 1994; Sherbourne and Hays 1990;
Uchino et al. 1996). One example of tangible financial support provided through
marriage is employer-sponsored health insurance, which is the predominant
source of insurance coverage in the United States. Historically, most firms have
not offered same-sex partners access to the same health insurance benefits as
would be available to different-sex spouses of employees, though more firms
increasingly were offering such benefits in recent years: 40 percent in 2017, up
from 22 percent in 2008 (Claxton et al. 2017). Alternatively, drawing on the
health capital framework (Grossman 1972), individuals may invest in health care

9

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

and adopt less risky behaviors and healthier lifestyles as a function of their
personal investment in the marriage (Sherbourne and Hays 1990). At the dyad
level, spouses may reinforce positive lifestyle behaviors such as healthy diet,
exercise, and nonsmoking or engage in direct social control of a spouse’s health
related behaviors (Umberson 1987; 1992; Wilson 2002). In other instances, an
unhealthy individual may directly and negatively affect the health of a spouse
through disease transmission or, indirectly, through caregiver effects (Schulz and
Beach 1999).
2.5 Literature on the effects of legal access to same-sex marriage on health and
healthcare access
A small number of studies have specifically examined the effects of legal SSM on
health and related outcomes using quasi-experimental variation.2 For example,
Dee (2008) examined same-sex relationship policies in Europe (mostly domestic
partner registration laws, not full marriage equality) and found that they were
related to reductions in sexually transmitted infections (such as syphilis) but not to
changes in the prevalence of non-sexually transmitted diseases. Francis et al.
(2012) find a similar but less robust result using variation from the United States
on state bans on same-sex marriage.

Raifman et al. (2017) find that the

2
We do not review here a substantial literature in psychology that is primarily qualitative in nature
and has examined how SSM affected mental health outcomes. We also do not review here studies
in public health that have primarily leveraged cross-sectional variation in legal access to SSM at a
point in time, as these studies cannot account for the other characteristics about states with legal
SSM (e.g., a more progressive climate) that may independently contribute to outcomes.

10

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

availability of legal same-sex marriage in the United States is associated with
significant reductions in youth suicide attempts among sexual minority students
using data from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveys. Hatzenbuehler et al. (2010)
used individual panel data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol
and Related Conditions spanning a period when many states implemented bans on
same-sex marriage in 2004 and 2005 and found that sexual minority individuals in
those states were significantly more likely to experience a range of psychiatric
disorders compared to the associated change experienced by heterosexuals and
compared to the associated change for sexual minority individuals in other states
that did not adopt bans on same-sex marriage. Hatzenbuehler et al. (2012) use
prospective data on 1,211 sexual minority men from a community health center in
Massachusetts before and after the state’s legalization of same-sex marriage in
2004 and found that sexual minority men had significantly decreased medical care
visits, including mental health care visits and mental health care costs. Moreover,
this effect was observed for both partnered and non-partnered sexual minority
men.

Finally, Gonzales (2015) examined how New York State’s marriage

equality adoption affected health insurance profiles of same-sex couples using
data from the American Community Surveys. He found that legal access to SSM
in New York was associated with statistically significant increases in the
probability of having employer sponsored insurance for individuals in same-sex
couples.

This finding supported previous studies finding increases in health

11

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

insurance coverage following relationship recognition laws (i.e., domestic
partnerships or civil unions) for lesbian women in California (Buchmueller and
Carpenter 2012) and women in same-sex couples in the Current Population
Survey (Dillender 2015).

3. Data Description and Empirical Approach
3.1 Data description
Our primary data come from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s
2000-2016 waves of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).
These telephone surveys are designed to be state representative and focus on
health outcomes, access to health care, and health behaviors. The annual sample
size of the BRFSS is very large: in recent years it has surpassed 400,000
observations in a single year. Interviews are performed throughout the calendar
year. In addition to questions about health, the survey also includes standard
demographic characteristics such as age, race/ethnicity, education, and marital
status.3 Our sample includes all adults aged 25 years and older.4

The survey was done exclusively via landlines through 2010; in 2011 a cellphone sample was
added. Because the household screener with questions about the number of adult men and adult
women in the household was not administered to the cellphone sample, we drop all cellphone
interviews from the sample since, as we describe below, our method for identifying the target
sample requires information on sex composition of adults in the household. The share of
cellphone interviews increased from about 12 percent in 2011 to 45 percent in 2016. In results not
reported but available upon request, we do not find statistically significant relationships between
the timing of legal access to same-sex marriage in one’s state and the likelihood of being in the
cellphone sample from 2011-2016, suggesting that composition bias is unlikely to be a serious

3

12

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

For our purposes a key feature of the BRFSS is that information on the sex
composition of adults in the household is ascertained during the household
screening portion of the interview (which is used to determine eligibility for the
rest of the interview). Specifically, one randomly selected adult in the household
is asked to state the number of adult men in the household and the number of
adult women in the household. We use this information to construct treatment
and control groups using the simple reasoning that gay and lesbian couples are
much more likely to have a household composed of exactly two same-sex adults
than are heterosexual couples. SAME-SEX MALE HOUSEHOLD is an indicator
variable equal to one for individuals who report their household contains exactly
two adult men and exactly zero adult women; SAME-SEX FEMALE
HOUSEHOLD is defined analogously. DIFFERENT-SEX HOUSEHOLD is an
indicator variable equal to one for individuals who report their household contains
exactly one adult man and one adult woman. A notable advantage of this indirect
approach for identifying individuals who are disproportionately likely to be
members of gay and lesbian couples is that respondents do not have to explicitly
self-identify as a sexual minority to the interviewer.

This plausibly lessens

concern. We also drop the small share of observations with missing data on demographic
characteristics or outcome variables.
4
Results adding 18-24 year olds were similar. Because the relationship between sexual
orientation and our household structure measure should be weaker for younger adults (who are
more likely to be students and/or co-residing with another same-sex adult for reasons other than a
romantic relationship), we drop 18-24 year olds from the main sample.

13

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

concerns about gay men and lesbians shielding their sexual orientation from the
survey.
Regarding marital status, the BRFSS asks respondents: “Are you…”. The
response options include: married; divorced; widowed; separated; never married;
and member of an unmarried couple.

The limitations of this question for

understanding the effects of legal access to SSM have been discussed elsewhere
(Carpenter and Gates 2008), but we note that the question did not explicitly ask
about legal marital status (so couples who live as if they were married might
respond ‘married’). Note also that an individual could have multiple marital
statuses at any one point in time (e.g., previously divorced but now married);
interviewers were instructed to code the one that is accurate for the respondent
that appears earliest in the list. Our primary outcome of interest is an indicator
variable for being married (which we define as MARRIED).
Regarding healthcare access, we use four measures that are common in the
literature. Specifically, the BRFSS asks respondents if they are covered by any
kind of health insurance plan; we use this information to create an indicator
variable called INSURED. We do not observe the type of plan nor in whose
name the plan was secured or purchased. Individuals are also asked if they have
“one person you think of as your personal doctor or health care provider”; we use
this information to create an indicator variable called USUAL SOURCE OF
CARE. Individuals are also asked if there was a time in the past year when they

14

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

needed to see a doctor but could not due to cost; we use this information to create
an indicator variable called UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS. Finally, regarding
healthcare access, individuals are asked when they last visited a doctor for a
routine checkup; we use this information to create an indicator variable called
HAD A PAST YEAR CHECK UP.
The BRFSS also asks respondents about their self-rated health, asking
individuals the following question: “Would you say that in general your health
is…”. Response options include: excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. We
follow prior work by examining two outcomes: EXCELLENT OR VERY GOOD
HEALTH and FAIR OR POOR HEALTH. Individuals are also asked about
health-related quality of life with the following question: “Now thinking about
your physical health, which includes physical illness and injury, for how many
days during the past 30 days was your physical health not good?” Individuals are
then asked: “Now thinking about your mental health, which includes stress,
depression, and problems with emotions, for how many days during the past 30
days was your mental health not good?” Individuals are asked to state the number
of days for each of these questions; we create indicator variables for AT LEAST
14 BAD PHYSICAL HEALTH DAYS IN PAST 30 (as a measure of severe
physical distress) and AT LEAST 14 BAD MENTAL HEALTH DAYS IN PAST
30 (as a measure of severe mental distress). Individuals are also asked: “During
the past 30 days, for about how many days did poor physical or mental health

15

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

keep you from doing your usual activities, such as self-care, work, or recreation?”
We define AT LEAST 14 ACTIVITY LIMITED DAYS IN PAST 30
accordingly.5
We also considered a range of substance use outcomes, as there is a large
body of evidence indicating that sexual minority adults have higher substance use
rates than heterosexual adults, possibly as self-medication and coping responses
to stress (Gonzales & Henning-Smith 2017). Specifically, we create an indicator
for whether the individual reported consuming any alcohol in the past month
(DRINKER), an indicator for whether the individual reported consuming five or
more drinks on average for men and 4 or more drinks on average for women
(BINGE DRINKER), and an indicator for whether the individual reports smoking
cigarettes every day or ‘some days’ (SMOKER).
Finally, we considered a range of preventive care utilization measures.
We examine indicators for having had a flu shot in the past year (FLU SHOT),
which is ascertained for all BRFSS respondents.

We also consider cancer

screenings: whether adult women had a Pap test in the past year (PAP TEST),
whether women age 50 and older had a mammogram in the past year

We also considered as additional outcomes a range of employment and household income
measures available in the demographic section of the BRFSS questionnaire, including
employment, labor force participation, and household income. There were no meaningful
associations between legal SSM and these outcomes. These results are available upon request.

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

(MAMMOGRAM) and whether men and women age 50 and older ever had a
colon cancer screening (COLON CANCER SCREENING).
3.2 Empirical approach
To estimate the effect of legal access to same-sex marriage on outcomes, we
begin by estimating standard two-way fixed effects models that rely on plausibly
exogenous variation in the timing of legal access to SSM across states. These
models are estimated on the sample of individuals in same-sex households
(separately for men and women) and take the form:
(1)

Yist = β0 + β1Xist + β2(LEGAL SAME-SEX MARRIAGE)st + β3Zst +
β4Ss + β5Tt + β6Ss*TRENDt + εist

where Yist are family structure, health insurance, access to care, and health
outcomes for individual i in state s at time t.6 LEGAL SAME-SEX MARRIAGEst
is an indicator variable equal to one for individuals living in states and times
where same-sex couples could legally wed. Zst is a vector of other state-time
varying economic and demographic variables that includes: the state-month
unemployment rate, the state-month population count, dummy variables for when
states expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, and state income
eligibility thresholds for the Children’s Health Insurance Program (to proxy for
public insurance program generosity in the state). Zst also includes other aspects

We estimate linear probability models for dichotomous outcomes for simplicity and ease of
interpretation, but results are not sensitive to this choice.

17

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

of the state policy environment for LGBT individuals and couples, including:
statutory bans on same-sex marriage, constitutional bans on same-sex marriage,
legal access to civil unions or registered domestic partnerships, nondiscrimination
protection covering sexual orientation in employment, religious freedom
restoration acts, and ‘bathroom bills’.7 Ss is a vector of state dummies to control
for time invariant characteristics about states; Tt is a vector of year and month
dummies to control for secular national period effects.8 We also control for statespecific linear time trends where we interact each state fixed effect with a variable
TREND that equals 1 in 2000, 2 in 2001, and so forth. These trends remove
variation caused by factors that are state-specific and trend linearly over time. The
coefficient of interest is β2 and in the presence of state, year, and month dummies
and linear state trends is identified from within-state deviations in outcomes from
a smooth linear trend coincident with variation in the timing of policy adoption
across states.

The key identifying assumption is that outcomes would have

evolved identically in states with and without legal SSM had they not been

Domestic partnership/civil union policies are coded as one of four mutually exclusive categories
depending upon a given policy’s combination of coverage and strength. Coverage, whether the
policy applies to all couples or same-sex couples only, is coded following Dillender (2014).
Strength, whether the policy extends all of the state-level rights associated with marriage or a
limited set of those rights, is coded following Badgett and Herman (2011).
8
To account for the change in the BRFSS sampling frame in 2011 we also include a dummy
variable for all observations in 2011 and later.

adopted.

Throughout, we use the BRFSS sampling weights, and we cluster

standard errors at the state level (Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan 2004).9

4. Results
4.1 Evidence on household structure and sexual orientation
Table 1 provides evidence that individuals in same-sex households are
differentially capturing samples that are likely to include gay and lesbian
couples.10 We begin with the most direct evidence using data from the 2014-2016
BRFSS in which 31 states at some point (depending on the survey wave) released
information on self-reported sexual orientation in the public use files. For these
states (shown in Figure 2) we can directly correlate our household structure
measures with self-reported sexual orientation to see if individuals in SSH are
indeed more likely to report a non-heterosexual orientation than individuals in
DSH.
Table 1 shows that this is clearly the case. The format of Table 1 is as
follows: each entry in the table shows the share of the relevant sample (captured
in each row) in the 2014-2016 BRFSS who reported any sexual orientation other
than heterosexual (in columns 1 and 3 for women and men, respectively) or who

9
Specifically, we follow Simon et al. (2017) in assigning sample weights by reweighting the
fraction of each individual’s assigned BRFSS sample weight over the sum of all weights in their
survey wave.
10
A substantial literature in demography also uses household structure to understand nonmarital
and marital cohabitation. See, for example, Casper and Cohen (2000).

19

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

reported a lesbian or gay sexual orientation (in columns 2 and 4, respectively).
The top row of Table 1 shows the shares for all adults in the states who released
the sexual orientation information on the public use files and conforms to prior
work: about 0.8 percent of women identify as lesbian, while about 2.3 percent of
women identify as lesbian, bisexual, or ‘other’. For men, 1.7 percent identify as
gay, while about 3 percent identify as gay, bisexual, or ‘other’.
In the next rows of Table 1 we separately examine individuals in differentsex households and individuals in same-sex households.

Of individuals in

different-sex households, we find that virtually none (0.1-0.2 percent) identifies as
lesbian or gay, and only about 1.2-1.4 percent identify as anything other than
heterosexual.

If we further restrict attention to individuals in different-sex

households who also report being married, the share identifying as anything other
than heterosexual falls even further. In contrast, for individuals in same-sex
households, Table 1 indicates that 11 percent of women and 27.8 percent of men
in those household configurations identify as something other than heterosexual.
Put differently, more than one in ten women in same-sex households and more
than one in four men in same-sex households are likely not heterosexual (and also
likely in a same-sex relationship). This means that for our reduced form models
below, estimates of the association between legal access to same-sex marriage and
outcomes for women (men) in same-sex households should be scaled up by
approximately a factor of ten (four). When we further examine individuals in

20

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

same-sex households who also report being married, the share choosing a nonheterosexual identity jumps even more: 46.4 percent for women in same-sex
households and 59.7 percent for men in same-sex households. Moreover, to the
extent that there is underreporting of non-heterosexual orientations in the BRFSS
due to stigma or other reasons, this is likely an underestimate of the amount of
signal in these samples.
Thus, Table 1 provides strong evidence that household structure conveys
meaningful information about a correlate of sexual orientation. These patterns
motivate our use of household structure for defining treated and falsification
samples for our difference-in-differences models below.11
4.2 Descriptive statistics
Having documented a meaningful relationship between household structure and
sexual orientation, we next present descriptive statistics for the individual
demographic characteristics, legal SSM variable, and health-related outcomes.
Figure 3 shows trends in the share of men and women in SSH who report being
married over our sample period. Several patterns are notable. First, the share of

In additional results not reported here but available upon request, we also found several other
less direct patterns that indicated that household structure is correlated in predictable ways with
what one would expect regarding different reproductive and sexual health behaviors for
individuals of different sexual orientations in the BRFSS. For example, women in same-sex
households are less likely to report being currently pregnant than women in different-sex
households. Men in same-sex households are more likely to report having ever been tested for
HIV than men in different-sex households. And both men and women in same-sex households are
less likely to have children under 18 in the household than men and women in different-sex
households. These same patterns have been documented previously in other work using BRFSS
household structure in this way (see, for example, Carpenter 2004).
11

21

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

men in SSH who report being married is higher than the associated share of
women in SSH, consistent with the patterns in Table 1 that there is more slippage
between sexual orientation and household structure in our measure for women.
Second, both shares increase over the sample period, with the share of men in
SSH who report being married increasing from about 10 percent to 20 percent and
the share of women in SSH who report being married increasing from about 5
percent to 10 percent.
Table 2 presents descriptive statistics for key variables for women in
same-sex households (column 1), women in different-sex households (column 2),
men in same-sex households (column 3), and men in different-sex households
(column 4). Approximately 10 percent of the sample lives in a state with legal
access to same-sex marriage over the study period. A much larger share of men
and women in different-sex households reports being married than men and
women in same-sex households. Regarding health care and health, Table 2 shows
that men and women in same-sex households are significantly less likely to be
insured, less likely to have a usual source of care, and more likely to report unmet
medical care needs due to cost compared to men and women in different-sex
households. Men and women in same-sex households are also significantly less
likely to report excellent or very good health, more likely to report fair or poor
health, and more likely to report 14 or more bad health days than men and women
in different sex households. Men and women in same-sex households are also

22

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

significantly more likely to report substance use (e.g., smoking and binge
drinking) than men and women in different-sex households. Finally, men and
women in same-sex households report significantly less preventive care (e.g., flu
shots, Pap tests, mammograms, and colon cancer screenings) than men and
women in different-sex households.
4.3 Effects of legal same-sex marriage on household composition
Before presenting estimates of the relationship between legal access to same-sex
marriage and marriage take-up, we begin in Table 3 with an analysis of how the
marriage equality variation relates to various measures of household composition.
This analysis is important for interpreting any effects we observe on marriage and
health-related outcomes because our empirical strategy relies on treatment and
comparison groups defined by household structure and household sex
composition.

If these variables themselves were meaningfully related to the

variation across space and time in legal access to same-sex marriage, composition
bias would be a concern.
Table 3 shows that this is unlikely to be the case, particularly for men.
Specifically, in Table 3 we report the coefficient on the LEGAL ACCESS TO
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE indicator variable from a fully saturated model of
equation (1) that includes all the individual level controls; state and time varying
characteristics and policies; state, month, and year fixed effects; and linear statespecific time trends. We consider four measures of household composition in

23

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

Table 3: the total number of adults the respondent reports in the household in
column 1; an indicator variable for whether the respondent reports there are
exactly two adults in the household in column 2; an indicator variable for whether
the respondent reports there are exactly two different-sex adults in the household
in column 3; and an indicator variable for whether the respondent reports there are
exactly two same-sex adults in the household in column 4.
The overall takeaway from Table 3 is that the relationship between legal
access to same-sex marriage and all of these outcomes is very small in magnitude
both absolutely and relative to the pre-reform means of the variables. Only one of
the eight estimates is significant (the probability a woman lives in a household
with two same-sex adults), and that effect size is 4.3 percent of the pre-reform
mean. This could be consistent with an increase in partnership and cohabitation
behavior among sexual minority women, though again the effects here are very
small. For men we find no evidence of possible composition bias related to the
timing of legal access to same-sex marriage in a respondent’s state.12

Appendix Table 1 makes a related point and shows the relationship between average
demographic characteristics of the individuals in same-sex households as a function of legal
access to same-sex marriage (and all the other controls in equation (1)). Appendix Table 1 reveals
little evidence of systematic selection for individuals in same-sex households when legal same-sex
marriage is in an individual’s state: the estimated changes in respondent characteristics associated
with legal same-sex marriage are generally small and insignificant, though there is some evidence
that the sample of individuals in same-sex households has lower education levels after legal samesex marriage in the respondent’s state. This pattern and the well documented fact that higher
educated people are more likely to have good jobs that offer health insurance suggests that the
estimated improvements in health insurance, access to care, and utilization we document below for
men in same-sex households associated with the timing of legal same-sex marriage are unlikely to
be driven by the changing characteristics of men in same-sex couples.

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

4.4 Effects of legal same-sex marriage on marriage take-up
Table 4 provides direct evidence on the relationship between legal access to samesex marriage and marriage take-up among individuals in same-sex households.
The format of this table is as follows: each entry in the table is a coefficient on the
LEGAL ACCESS TO SAME-SEX MARRIAGE indicator from a fully saturated
regression model that includes the individual demographics; state characteristics;
other state LGBT policy variables; state, month, and year fixed effects; and linear
state-specific time trends. Column 1 reports results for women, while column 2
reports results for men. The top panel reports results for the sample of individuals
in same-sex households, our primary treatment group. The bottom panel reports
results for a comparison sample that should be largely unaffected by legal access
to same-sex marriage: individuals in different-sex households.
The results in Table 4 return strong evidence that legal access to SSM was
associated with statistically and economically significant increases in marriage
take-up among individuals in same-sex households. For women in the top panel
of column 1, for example, we estimate that legal SSM was associated with a
significant 3.7 percentage point increase in the likelihood a woman in a SSH
reported being married. Relative to a pre-reform mean of 4.7 percent, this is a
78.7 percent proportional effect. Recall that approximately 10 percent of women
in same-sex households would identify as something other than heterosexual;
thus, the treatment effect on the treated sample of non-heterosexual women is

25

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

closer to a 37 percentage point increase in marriage take-up. Measured another
way, over our sample period the share of women in SSH who reported being
married increased by about five percentage points (see Figure 3); our estimate in
the top panel of column 1 of Table 4 suggests that legal access to same-sex
marriage can explain about 74 percent of that increase. The bottom panel of
column 1 of Table 4 confirms that the marriage effects we estimate in the top
panel are unique to women in same-sex households; there is no meaningful
relationship between legal access to same-sex marriage and being married for
women in different-sex households.
The results for men in column 2 of Table 4 are similar to the results for
women.

Specifically, we estimate that legal access to same-sex marriage is

associated with a 5.7 percentage point increase in the likelihood that a man in a
same-sex household reports being married (top row, column 2). This result is
statistically significant and is large relative to the pre-reform mean of 13.6
percent. Given that Table 1 showed that about 27 percent of men in same-sex
households would identify as something other than heterosexual, the treatment
effect on sexual minority men is closer to a 21 percentage point increase in
marriage take-up. Measured another way, over the sample period the share of
men in SSH who reported being married increased by about ten percentage points;
our estimate in the top panel of column 2 of Table 4 can explain well over half of
this overall increase. The bottom panel of column 2 of Table 4 confirms that the

26

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

marriage effects we observe in the top row are uniquely observed for men in
same-sex households.13
We explore the robustness of the main findings of Table 4 in a variety of
ways. First, in Figures 4 and 5 for women and men, respectively, we show
graphically the estimates from an event study model in which we replace the
single access to legal SSM indicator with a series of event time indicators
representing time relative to adoption of legal SSM in the individual’s state (we
observe exact interview date in the BRFSS, so policy timing can be assigned with
high accuracy).14 The results in Figures 4 and 5 clearly demonstrate that increases
in marriage among individuals in same-sex households follow access to legal
same-sex marriage in one’s state. Importantly, there is no evidence of systematic
differential trends in marriage in the period leading up to legal access to same-sex
Appendix Table 2 provides an expanded set of coefficient estimates corresponding to the top
panel of Table 4. Most other LGBT-related public policies are not meaningfully related to the
likelihood individuals in same-sex households report being married. In Appendix Table 3 we
report marriage effects by demographic group to examine descriptively the heterogeneity in
marriage take-up. We also present the share of individuals in same-sex households in each of the
relevant demographic groups who report a non-heterosexual orientation (again extrapolating from
the 2014-2016 BRFSS data). The results in Appendix Table 3 indicate that legal access to samesex marriage had broad-based effects at increasing marriage. For both men and women we find
meaningful (but not always statistically significant) estimated increases associated with legal
access to same-sex marriage for both young and older adults (columns 1 and 2), white and
nonwhite adults (columns 3 and 4), less educated and more educated adults (columns 5 and 6), and
individuals in households with and without children present (columns 7 and 8). We consistently
estimate that the marriage take-up effect is larger for women in SSH without children present,
which is unexpected since the tangible returns to marriage are likely larger for households with
children. One possible explanation is that women in SSH with children are more likely to have
crossed state lines to get a marriage license (precisely because the returns to doing so are
nontrivial); this would cause the legal access variable to be mismeasured for women in SSH which
could bias the estimate toward zero.
14
A limitation of this approach is that we do not observe cross state migration, so we cannot know
if the person lived in that same state many years before the interview.
13

27

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

marriage, which is indirect evidence in support of the parallel trends assumption
required for identification. This is perhaps not surprising given that much of the
policy variation was driven by relatively unexpected judicial decisions.
We report a series of other robustness analyses in Table 5. The format of
Table 5 is as follows: each entry is the coefficient on legal access to SSM from a
separate regression that includes all the individual and state controls as well as the
state, month, and year fixed effects and linear state trends (unless otherwise
noted). We report results for women in SSH in the top panel and for men in SSH
in the bottom panel. Each column shows the results of a different robustness
analysis relative to the baseline model for marriage from the top panel of columns
1 and 2 of Table 4; we reprint those baseline estimates in column 1 of Table 5. In
column 2 of Table 5 we report estimates from a model that excludes the linear
state trends but retains all other controls, including the state and time fixed
effects. Those models return notably larger estimated effects of access to legal
same-sex marriage on the likelihood individuals in same-sex households report
being married, suggesting that our models with linear state trends are conservative
estimates of the effects of legal access to SSM on outcomes. In column 3 we
revert to the baseline model with linear state trends and show estimates from
models that recode California as turned ‘off’ (i.e., not having legal access to
same-sex marriage) until the U.S. v. Windsor decision in June 2013. Our baseline
model codes California as ‘on’ in the summer of 2008 for the short period when

28

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

same-sex marriage was legal in the state before a statewide vote in ‘Proposition 8’
ended same-sex marriages. In column 4 we show estimates where we drop
California entirely from the estimation. Both estimates from columns 3 and 4 of
Table 5 show that our core results on marriage take-up are not sensitive to the
treatment of California (and in fact are even larger when we exclude the state
entirely). In column 5 we show estimates from models that exclude the BRFSS
sample weights; results are robust to estimating unweighted models. In column 6
we report results where we add 18-24 year olds back to the full sample; estimates
continue to suggest significant effects of legal access to same-sex marriage on
marriage take-up. Finally, column 7 of Table 5 shows results from a model where
we drop anyone who – when asked about their employment status – responded
that they are a student. Excluding students returns similar estimates of the effect
of legal access to same-sex marriage on the likelihood individuals in same-sex
households report being married, which is perhaps not surprising since our main
sample selection criteria exclude 18-24 year olds.
4.5 Effects of legal same-sex marriage on health-related outcomes
Having documented that legal access to same-sex marriage significantly increased
marriage among women and men in same-sex households, we now turn to
examining effects on health-related outcomes. We present these health-related
outcomes in Table 6. The format of Table 6 is as follows: each entry is the
coefficient on LEGAL ACCESS TO SAME-SEX MARRIAGE from a fully

29

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

saturated regression (including linear state trends). We present estimates for
women in same-sex households in column 1 and for men in same-sex households
in column 2. Each row is a different outcome variable, and the relevant sample
sizes for men and women are reported after each outcome. We also reprint the
marriage take-up estimate in the top row of Table 6 for reference. We separate
the health-related outcomes into the various categories: insurance and access to
care; self-rated health and bad health days; substance use; and preventive care.
The results in Table 6 provide little evidence that legal access to same-sex
marriage had meaningful effects on health-related outcomes for women in samesex households, despite the clear evidence in the prior tables that the policy
increased marriage take-up for this sample. For health outcomes in column 1 of
Table 6 few estimates are statistically significant, and most are small in
magnitude. The handful of estimates that are statistically significant are as likely
to indicate that legal same-sex marriage was associated with worse outcomes
(more smoking, less flu shots) for women in SSH as they are to indicate that legal
same-sex marriage was associated with better outcomes (lower probability of
reporting 14 or more bad mental health days, lower probability of reporting 14 or
more activity limited days) in this sample.
For men in same-sex households, in contrast, we estimate that legal access
to same-sex marriage was associated with statistically significant improvements
in insurance coverage, access to care, and utilization. Specifically, we estimate in

30

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

column 2 of Table 6 that legal access to same-sex marriage increased the
probability a man in a same-sex household reported being insured by 4.2
percentage points. Relative to the pre-reform mean, this is a 5.4 percent effect
(compared to the 42 percent marriage take-up effect in the top row of column 2 of
Table 6).

Similarly, we estimate that legal access to same-sex marriage

significantly increased the likelihood a man in a same-sex household reported a
usual source of care by 4.2 percentage points and had a checkup in the past year
by 7.3 percentage points (6 and 12 percent effects, respectively).15 Turning to
health outcomes, we find no relationship between legal access to same-sex
marriage and self-rated health, substance use, or preventive care take-up for men
in same-sex households. Thus, we find consistent evidence for men in same-sex
households that legal access to same-sex marriage not only increased marriage
take-up but also significantly increased health insurance coverage, access to
healthcare, and utilization of checkups.16
In results not reported but available upon request, we found that restricting attention to adults
age 65 or older – the vast majority of whom are eligible for Medicare – continued to return strong
evidence that men in same-sex households were significantly more likely to report being married
when legal same-sex marriage was available, but they were not significantly more likely to report
being insured, having a usual doctor, or having had a past year checkup when legal same-sex
marriage was available. This suggest that the effects of legal same-sex marriage on having a usual
doctor and on past year checkups for men in same-sex households in the full sample is most likely
due to the price effect coming through increased health insurance as opposed to other effects of
marriage (e.g., the ‘nagging spouse’ effect).
16
Appendix Table 4 shows the results from the same robustness exercises as in Table 5 on the
outcomes indicating a significant relationship with legal access to same-sex marriage for men in
same-sex households (insurance, usual source of care, and checkup in past year) and shows that
they are largely robust. Appendix Figures 1-3 also show event study figures for those same
outcomes. Although we do not find evidence of systematic pre-trends in outcomes prior to legal
same-sex marriage in the respondent’s state, few of the ‘years since legal same-sex marriage’
15

5. Discussion and Conclusion
The results above provide novel evidence on how legal access to SSM is
associated with marriage take-up and health-related outcomes for adults in samesex households. We show that a nontrivial share of these individuals are likely to
be sexual minorities.

We consistently estimate that legal access to SSM is

associated with statistically significant increases in the likelihood that men and
women in same-sex households report being married.

These increases in

marriage were also associated with significant increases in the likelihood of
reporting health insurance coverage and various measures of access to healthcare
such as having a usual source of care for men in same-sex households. These
effects were robust to numerous sample and specification checks, including event
study estimation. Notably, we did not find that legal access to same-sex marriage
significantly affected substance use, self-rated health, or preventive care for
event time dummies are individually statistically significant. In results not reported, we also
considered other robustness tests to further probe the result that legal access to same-sex marriage
increased health insurance, access to care, and utilization for men in same-sex households. For
example, we estimated difference-in-differences models restricting attention only to men who
reported being married or a member of an unmarried couple. This approach assumes legal access
to same-sex marriage had no effects on partnership, but an advantage is that we are more confident
that men in same-sex households who report being married or a member of an unmarried couple
are sexual minorities (see Table 1). Results from that sample continued to suggest that legal
access to same-sex marriage significantly increased marriage, insurance, access to care, and
utilization. We also estimated a fully interacted triple differences model where we included
individuals in different-sex households and examined the coefficient on the interaction between
being in a same-sex household and having legal access to same-sex marriage, controlling for a full
set of state by same-sex household, year by same-sex household, and state by year fixed effects.
These models also returned evidence of significant increases in marriage, health insurance, access
to care, and utilization for men in same-sex households associated with legal access to same-sex
marriage. These results are available upon request.

32

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

individuals in same-sex households. One possibility is that it will take more time
and experience with legal same-sex marriage to see improvements in these health
outcomes.
We consistently estimate that legal access to same-sex marriage did not
systematically improve healthcare access and health-related outcomes for women
in same-sex households. The null finding for women in same-sex households for
health insurance contrasts with results from Buchmueller and Carpenter (2012)
and Dillender (2015) who found that lesbians in same-sex relationships were
significantly more likely to be insured when states extended marriage-like status
to same-sex couples compared to the associated change for heterosexual women
in different-sex relationships. Why might this be the case? There are several
possibilities. One issue may be related to how migration and state of residence
are measured in the BRFSS. If lesbian couples were more likely to travel across
state borders to obtain a marriage license than gay men, this would dampen the
apparent association between legal access to marriage in the observed state of
residence and both marriage and health-related outcomes for women in SSH. We
know from other work that lesbian households are much more likely to have
children in the household which could have increased the incentive for legal
marriage even if it were not available in one’s home state. Because we lack data
on prior residence and location of marriage, we cannot test this hypothesis
directly, but it is an important question for future work. Also, our measurement

33

Effects of Legal Access to Same-Sex Marriage

of same-sex households was a much better indicator for men in same-sex
households versus women in same-sex households.
Overall our results are the first to span the entire rollout of legal access to
same-sex marriage in the United States. We offer the most comprehensive quasiexperimental evaluation of legal access to same-sex marriage on adult outcomes,
and our findings suggest that access to marriage benefited the health of some
sexual minorities. Recent efforts to dismantle legal access to same-sex marriage
may negatively affect family and health outcomes, particularly among men in
same-sex households. Ongoing research on same-sex marriage should continue to
use innovative techniques and data sources collecting sexual orientation to
monitor the impacts of same-sex marriage on various economic, health, and
demographic outcomes.

Notes: † significant at 10%; * significant at 5%. Each entry is the coefficient on Access to Legal Same-Sex Marriage from a separate regression. All models
control for: dummy variables for 5 year age ranges, dummy variables for education (less than high school, some college, college or more, and refusal to provide
educational attainment), dummy variables for race/ethnicity (black, Asian, Native American, Hispanic, other race, and race not ascertained), the state
unemployment rate, state population, ACA Medicaid expansions, and CHIP income eligibility thresholds. Models also include state, month, and year fixed
effects as well as linear state-specific time trends and a dummy variable equal to 1 for individuals interviewed after the 2011 changes in BRFSS methodology.
Results use the BRFSS sampling weights as described in the text. Standard errors are clustered at the state level.
