ABSTRACT
We study reserve prices computed to maximize the expected profit of the seller based on
historical observations of incomplete bid data typically available to the auction designer in online
auctions for advertising or e-commerce. This direct approach to computing reserve prices
circumvents the need to fully recover distributions of bidder valuations. We derive asymptotic
results and also provide a new bound, based on the empirical Rademacher complexity, for the
number of historical auction observations needed in order for revenue under the estimated reserve
price to approximate revenue under the optimal reserve arbitrarily closely. This simple approach
to estimating reserves may be particularly useful for auction design in Big Data settings, where
traditional empirical auctions methods may be costly to implement. We illustrate the approach
with e-commerce auction data from eBay. We also demonstrate how this idea can be extended to
estimate all objects necessary to implement the Myerson (1981) optimal auction.

1. I NTRODUCTION
Auctions are one of the main selling mechanisms used online. Not only are
they employed to sell physical goods through sites such as eBay, but also to offer
advertisement space online, such as through Google’s DoubleClick. Display and
banner ads have become a common tool to target consumers, which is conducted
via real-time bidding, in which impressions are commonly sold via second-price,
sealed-bid auctions that last a fraction of a second. It is estimated that over $20
billion dollars are sold via real-time bidding per year (eMarketer 2016), providing
an abundance of data on bidding activity and reflecting the relevance and potential revenue gains from implementing the best auctions possible. Traditional approaches to empirical auctions would analyze such data by estimating underlying
distributions of bidder valuations and then computing counterfactual mechanisms
of interest, such as optimal reserve prices or other instruments of auction design.
These approaches, however, can be computationally demanding, in particular in
large data settings, and are unlikely to be implemented in real-time by online platforms interested in optimal auction design. We provide a more direct approach to
obtaining the information required for optimal reserve prices in these online auctions. The primary virtue of the approach is that it is simple to execute—a practical
approach to computing optimal reserve prices in certain environments without the
effort necessary to fully estimate distributions of bidder valuations.
The online auction environments we are interested in studying typically follow
a second-price-like format, where, unlike traditional ascending auctions, the highest bid is recorded. We show that this opens up a new and more direct approach
to obtaining the information required for computing optimal reserve prices. Our
starting point is the observation that seller profit is a simple-to-compute function
of the reserve price and the two highest bids—and thus profit can be computed
even with incomplete bidding data (i.e. where not all bids are observed) and without observing the number of bidders. Although it is true that, in theory, complex

auction design may be optimal—such as the Myerson (1981) auction for asymmetric independent private values (IPV) settings—in practice, the seller’s primary
instrument of auction design in the real world is typically a single reserve price.
We demonstrate that the optimal single reserve price can be computed using only
historical observations of data on the two highest bids by simply maximizing the
seller profit function with respect to the reserve price.
We derive several properties of estimated reserve prices. We prove consistency,
demonstrate that the asymptotic distribution of the estimator of the optimal reserve price is non-normal, and derive its asymptotic distribution. Our interest in
deriving these results is not theoretical but is instead practical: we wish to provide
a clear notion of how many previous transactions the practicioneer needs to observe
in order for it be the case that designing an auction based on estimated reserves is
a good idea. In this spirit, we then provide a type of result that is relatively new
to the empirical auctions literature: we derive an explicit lower bound, based on
the empirical Rademacher complexity, for the number of auctions one would need
to observe in order to guarantee that the revenue based on the estimated reserve
price approximates the true optimal revenue arbitrarily closely.
All of our results allow for the number of bidders in each auction to be unknown, a data complication which has precluded nearly all previous empirical
auction methods. When the number of bidders is unobserved, approaches relying
on inverting order statistic distributions (Haile and Tamer 2003; Athey and Haile
2007; Aradillas-López et al. 2013) cannot be applied. This has particularly been an
issue for online auctions, where the number of bidders is often unobserved to the
econometrician.1 Exceptions in the literature allowing for an unobserved number
of bidders in second-price-like/ascending auction cases include Song (2004), Kim
and Lee (2014), Platt (2017), and Freyberger and Larsen (2017), which each focus
on symmetric independent (or conditionally independent) private values settings.
Relative to our method, these approaches have the advantage of yielding estimates
1

For example, on eBay, if a bidder intends to bid in an auction but sees that the price has already
exceeded her valuation, her bid will not be recorded, leading to a situation in which the number of
bidders placing bids differs from the true number of bidders.

of the underlying valuation distributions, but at a higher computational cost. Our
method circumvents the need for estimating valuation distributions and instead
directly estimates the optimal reserve price. Also, it is important to emphasize
that the specific information environments and data requirements we consider
(asymmetric, possibly correlated, private values where the number of bidders is
unobserved to the econometrician and bidding data is incomplete) are settings for
which no identification results exist in the auction literature for obtaining distributions of valuations even if that were the desired object of interest.
The computational simplicity of this approach can be particularly attractive given
the recent advent of Big Data. Specifically, auctions for online advertising or ecommerce often contain too many records to be feasibly analyzed using traditional
structural methods, which would typically involve 1) restricting to a sample of
data in a flat file which can be analyzed in standard statistical software; 2) fully recovering the underlying distribution of buyer valuations through maximum likelihood estimation or other approaches, which often require searching over multidimensional parameter spaces; and 3) computing optimal reserve prices (e.g. Paarsch
1997; Bajari and Hortaçsu 2003). In contrast, our approach requires only searching
over a single dimension at once and can be performed with a simple grid search,
raising the possibility of computing optimal reserve prices directly on data storage platforms (e.g. Teradata, Hadoop, Spark) without bringing the data into more
traditional analysis packages (e.g. Matlab, R, etc.).
We apply our approach to a sample of popular smartphone products sold through
eBay auctions. We find that implementing the optimal reserve price in these settings would raise expected profit between 0.11–0.86% compared to an auction with
a reserve price equal to the seller’s value, depending on the product. In the data
we find that a history of at least 7–25 auctions are required in order for an auction
using the estimated reserve price to outperform an auction with the reserve price
set to the seller’s value.

We also demonstrate an interesting extension of our methodology to the setting
of the Myerson (1981) optimal auction. If, in addition to the two highest bids, the
highest bidder’s identity is also known, we show how to recover bidder-specific
marginal revenue curves (as defined by Bulow and Roberts 1989) in asymmetric
IPV settings, enabling the Myerson (1981) optimal auction to be implemented. We
use simulated data to illustrate this approach and quantify the revenue gain from
optimal auction design. While the Myerson (1981) auction is not widely used in
practice, auctions with “soft floors” have been used explicitly to deal with potential asymmetry between bidders.2 However, as Zeithammer (2017) demonstrated,
this auction format can actually be detrimental to sellers, in which case implementing the Myerson (1981) auction might be a preferred alternative. When there are
concerns about discriminating bidders, recovering marginal revenue curves allows
one to implement the symmetric auction proposed by Deb and Pai (2017), which
yields the same expected revenue to the seller as the original Myerson (1981) auction.
Our approach is related to a theoretical literature at the intersection of economics and computer science that examines approximately optimal auctions in a variety
of cases, as surveyed by Roughgarden (2014). In particular, several studies in this
literature employed the same tools from statistical learning theory we use to derive our finite sample bound on the difference between the optimal expected revenue and the one accrued from an auction using an estimated reserve price. For
example, Cole and Roughgarden (2014) derive the number of auctions needed to
approximate the optimal expected revenue as a function the number of bidders under the asymmetric IPV setting of Myerson (1981); under the same paradigm, but
assuming that the number of bidders is either observed or drawn from a known
distribution, Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2015) introduce a regret minimization algorithm
to choose the reserve price; Alaei et al. (2013) extend the environment to allow for
2

A soft floor is a threshold that effectively determines the auction format. If the highest bid is below
it, the winner pays her own bid, thereby characterizing a first-price auction. On the other hand, if at
least one bid is above the soft floor, the wininng bidder’s payment will be equal to the maximum of
the soft floor and the second highest bid, which constitutes a second-price auction. Reserve prices
in soft floor auctions are also known as “hard floors”.

richer bidder preferences, including multi-dimensional types; Morgenstern and
Roughgarden (2015) allow for several units being auctioned at the same time;
Roughgarden and Wang (2016) consider the problem of choosing bidder-specific
reserve prices; Kanoria and Nazerzadeh (2017) consider a dynamic environment
of repeated auctions and how strategic bidder account for a seller using their past
bids to learn the distribution of valuation; and Balcan et al. (2018) extend the analysis to mechanisms other than auctions. Unlike these papers, we do not require
bidder valuations to be independent, nor do we impose any restrictions on the
number of bidders or the process behind which it is drawn. On the other hand, we
do not consider regret minimization, implementation algorithms, multiple units
or reserves, dynamics, or more general bidder preferences. Within this literature,
the paper to which ours is most closely related is Mohri and Medina (2016), who
introduced several results we leverage in this study. We reinterpret their learning
framework as a sample size-dependent implementation decision from the vantage
point of the seller.
Our paper also contributes to a literature in economics that provides direct inference about reserve prices or other objects of interest to auction design rather
than attempting to estimate the full distribution of valuations, such as Li et al.
(2003), Haile and Tamer (2003), Tang (2011), Aradillas-López et al. (2013), Coey
et al. (2014), Chawla et al. (2014), and Coey et al. (2017). We also relate to other
work empirical focusing on online e-commerce auctions, such as Song (2004) or
Platt (2017), and online ad auctions. In this paper, we consider only private values
settings; in theory work, Abraham et al. (2016) model ad auctions with common
values. In extending our approach to address the Myerson auction empirically,
we also relate to Celis et al. (2014), which addresses non-regular distributions and
Myerson’s ironing in ad auctions, while we focus only on regular distributions. Finally, our work is related to the work of Ostrovsky and Schwarz (2016), where the
authors experimentally varied reserve prices in position ad auctions to measure
the improvement in profits from choosing different reserve prices.

2. O PTIMAL R ESERVE P RICES
We consider private value, second-price auctions. Values are independent and
identically distributed across auctions, but within auctions we allow for arbitrary
correlation in bidders’ values and asymmetric valuation distributions among bidders. Let N be a random variable representing the number of potential bidders for
a given auction. Let V pkq represent the kth highest value among these N bidders.3

As in the entry model of Samuelson (1985), in a given auction each potential
entrant observes the realization of her value and enters if her value exceeds the
reserve price r. We assume that bidders do not bid above their values, and that
if either of the two potential entrants with the highest values enter, they bid their

values.4 This implies that the two highest bids, if they exist, are V p1q and V p2q .5 We
will not require that the econometrician observe the number of potential or actual
entrants.
Each potential entrant i has a type t

P t1, . . . , Tu. In the most general case, each

bidder has his own type. All potential entrants with type t have values that are
continuously distributed on some finite interval r0, ωt s, with ω̄



maxt ωt . Let

Ft denote this distribution, and f t the corresponding density. We use F and f to
denote the joint distribution and density of all potential entrants’ values.

3As in Song (2004), we use this notation, rather than the traditional notation V n:n , V n1:n , etc.,

because in our case the order statistics come from samples of varying sizes. That is, V pkq is the kth
highest bid among N bidders, unconditional on the realization of the random variable N, and is
thus a draw from the distribution

where FV nk 1:n is the distribution of the kth highest bid conditional on n, the realization of N.
4This is an implication of the dynamic bidding model in Song (2004). Athey and Haile (2002) also
argue, “...for many ascending auctions, a plausible ... hypothesis is that bids V n2:n and below do
not always reflect the full willingness to pay of losing bidders, although V n1:n does (since only
two bidders are active when that bid is placed).”
5This may not be true for other entry models. In Levin and Smith (1994), where bidders do not
observe their values before entering, the two highest value bidders need not enter even if their
values exceed the reserve price.

where we suppress dependence of p on v0 for notational simplicity. We use the

term optimal reserve to refer to a reserve price maximizing pprq, and denote such a

the optimal reserve price. Rather, these observations should be included as having
a realization of zero for the missing bid, as zero is precisely the contribution such a
bid would make to the seller’s profit in such cases. Auctions with zero bidders can
be ignored, as the seller receives zero profit from these auctions no matter what
reserve is chosen.
It is important to note that our approach implicitly assumes that historical re-

p1q and V p2q are representative of future realizations; that is, we
j

alizations of Vj

assume that these distributions are stable over time. In practice, these distributions may change, for example, due to changes in the underlying demand for the
product. Our approach requires observations of auctions with no reserve price in
order to correctly estimate the reserve price; once the estimated reserve price is put
into practice, the practitioner will no longer observe the full distribution of second
highest bids (as the reserve price will bind in some auctions). In practice, therefore, the practitioner may find it useful to periodically remove or reduce reserve
prices in order to obtain anew data on second and first highest bids and recompute
the optimal reserve price. This issue is discussed in a different context in Chawla
et al. (2014), who proposed an alternative approach to auction design rather than
relying on reserve prices.
On par with the rest of the empirical auctions literature, we do not model how
distributions of bids could change due to bidders strategically accounting for how
these bids will be used to set reserve prices in the future. As pointed out by Ostrovsky and Schwarz (2016), these dynamic concerns disappear as the market grows
large.
In our empirical application, we highlight that the loss from using a non-optimal
reserve price is asymmetric, in that the loss from setting too high a reserve is much
larger than the loss from setting too low a reserve (see also Kim 2013 and Ostrovsky
and Schwarz 2016). The practitioner may find it useful, therefore, to scale down estimated reserves by some value less than one, and then increase this scaling factor

10

COEY, LARSEN, SWEENEY, AND WAISMAN

as number of observed auctions grows.7 We do not consider this scaling approach
here but believe this would be a promising modification to directly implementing
estimated reserve prices.
The reserve prices we compute do not condition explicitly on auction-level heterogeneity. This can be considered either as a direct focus on homogeneous goods,
where reserve prices can be estimated separately for each distinct good (as in our
empirical application), or instead as a practical approach to computing reserve
prices in cases where auction designers know that auction-level heterogeneity is
present but cannot condition on it, and are restricted to choosing instead a single,
unconditional reserve price. An example of such a setting are some display ad auction platforms that, either for technological reasons or for purposes of keeping the
platform easy to understand for participants, set only a single reserve price for all
ads sold in a given timeframe. Our approach can be extended to account explicitly for auction-level heterogeneity, conditioning the estimation of reserve prices
on a vector of observed auction-level covariates, Wj . For example, one could use
kernel smoothing to estimate the expectation in (3) conditional on Wj , use these
estimates to construct the objective function in (4) and then proceed as before. The
underlying assumption would be that, conditional on Wj , the observed auctions
are independently and identically distributed.

In this section we discuss the properties of estimated reserve prices and revenue. We begin by providing traditional asymptotic results for the estimator and
discussing inference. We then provide a new bound on the number of auctions
that must be observed in order for the auction revenue using the estimated reserve
price to approximate the true optimal revenue arbitrarily closely. All proofs are
found in the Appendix.
7The field experiments of Ostrovsky and Schwarz (2016) were subject to a scaling factor enforced

by the auction platform because the platform feared setting too high of a reserve.

3.1. Asymptotic Properties. We now present asymptotic results for the estimators

r̂ J and p̂pr̂ J q. Standard M-estimation theory establishes the consistency of r̂ J for r .

We apply Theorem 2.1 from Newey and McFadden (1994), whose conditions we
show are satisfied.
Assumption 1. pprq is continuous, with pprq uniquely maximized at r , where r belongs
to a compact set.
Assumption 1 is common in the econometrics literature. Note that the assumption that r belongs to a compact set is natural in our setting given that we model
valuations as belonging to a bounded interval.

Newey and McFadden (1994) are satisfied, which yields Theorem 1. Having estabp

lished consistency, we now derive the asymptotic distribution of the estimator r̂ J ,
which is not standard. This ultimately implies that this estimator belongs to a class
of estimators that converge at a cube-root rate, of which an example is the maximum score estimator proposed by Manski (1975). To demonstrate this and derive
the asymptotic distribution, we show that the conditions in the main theorem of
Kim and Pollard (1990), adapted below, are satisfied.
We first introduce the following notation and assumptions. Let π̃ p, rq  π p, rq 

has nondegenerate increments, then J 1{3 pr̂ J  r q converges in distribution to the random
maximizer of Z.
The slow rate of convergence of r̂ J (cube-root rate) suggests a strong data re-

quirement to obtain a precise estimate of r . In other words, the econometrician
must observe many previous auctions in order to accurately estimate the optimal
reserve price. In Section 3.2 we provide an explict bound on this data requirement
and discuss how it relates to Theorem 2.

While estimating the optimal reserve price itself may require a large amount of
data, determining how much the auction designer could gain from optimally choosing
the reserve price does not. In fact, p̂pr̂ J q converges at a square-root rate to a normal
distribution, which we present in the following theorem:

To conclude our discussion of traditional asymptotic results, we briefly discuss
inference. Simulating the asymptotic distribution of r̂ J is impractical as Σ depends

upon the distributions of the two order statistics used to estimate r , which motivates the use of resampling methods. Abrevaya and Huang (2005) showed that
the nonparametric bootstrap is not valid for this cube-root class of estimators. Alternative resampling methods that may be used in this case include subsampling
(Delgado et al. 2001), m out of n bootstrap (Lee and Pun 2006), numerical bootstrap
(Hong and Li 2017), and rescaled bootstrap (Cattaneo et al. 2017). Another possibility is to replace the indicator in the objective function with a smoothed estimator,
which, along with further assumptions, might restore asymptotic normality and
achieve faster rates of convergence, akin to the Horowitz (1992) smoothed maximum score estimator. We leave this possibility as an avenue for future research.
However, the nonparametric bootstrap can be used for inference on the object
p̂prˆJ q. Let p̂b prq be the objective function defined above calculated from a bootstrap

3.2. Bound on Revenue Performance. We now provide a new theoretical argu-

ment establishing a probabilistic upper bound on the quantity ppr q  ppp

shrinks to zero at the rate plog J { J q1{2 . This argument is closely related to work by
Mohri and Medina (2016), although the bounds Mohri and Medina (2016) derive
are less explicit than ours.8

estimated reserve price if the seller chooses the reserve that maximizes profit on

r J q, which, by definition, is lower than the expected profit given by the optimal

reserve price, ppr q. We study the size of this difference, and how it changes as the
number of observed auctions becomes large.

We state our bound in the following theorem. Its proof uses techniques from
statistical learning to probabilistically bound the difference between ppprq and pprq
uniformly in r. Specifically, the empirical Rademacher complexity (defined in the Appendix) plays a key role in obtaining this bound. These techniques are developed
in Koltchinskii (2001) and Koltchinskii and Panchenko (2002); Mohri et al. (2012)
provide a textbook overview.
8Mohri and Medina’s (2016) bounds are stated in terms of the Rademacher complexity and pseudo-

dimension of the class of possible reserve price functions mapping observables to reserves. The
authors consider reserve prices that may be a function of observable covariates, which we do not
do here.

Equivalently, in order for the profit from the estimated reserve to be within ε of
the profit from the optimal reserve with probability at least 1  δ, the seller needs
to have observed approximately J auctions such that the expression in the righthand side of the expression in Theorem 4 equals ε. It can be shown that when
J



1 the expression is positive and that it is strictly decreasing in J, which, in

principle, enables one to obtain the desired J for each pδ, εq via a simple bisection
procedure. The only assumption made on the first order statistic of bidders’ values
in this theorem is that it is non-negative and bounded above. Bidders’ values may
be arbitrarily correlated with each other and may be drawn from asymmetric marginal distributions. Note also that the right-hand side only depends on the value
distribution through its upper bound ω, and not, for example, its variance. It is
also important to note that the bound in Theorem 4 relates to the optimal reserve,

r , and the true expected profit function, ppq, without requiring these objects to be

known.

is much closer to the optimal profit. Each iso-data curve is relatively flat in the δ

for achieving a given level of ε closeness to the optimal profit, and are less stringent
for achieving an improvement in δ (i.e. in the probability with which the revenue
is reached).

requiring knowledge of ppq or r .

4. C OMPUTING O PTIMAL R ESERVE P RICES IN E- COMMERCE A UCTIONS
We apply our methodology to a dataset of eBay auctions selling commodity
products, which we define as those products which are cataloged in one of several
commercially available product catalogs. Examples of commodity products include ”Microsoft Xbox One, 500 GB Black Console”, ”Chanel No.5 3.4oz Women’s
Eau de Parfum”, and ”The Sopranos - The Complete Series (DVD, 2009)”. We will
refer to each distinct product as a “product” or “product-category.” Within each
product, the items sold are relatively homogeneous. For this exercise, we select
popular smartphone products listed through auctions in 2013. We consider only
auctions with no reserve price; specifically, we only include auctions for which the
start price was less than or equal to $0.99, the default start price recommendation
on eBay. We omit auctions in which the highest bid is in the top 1% of all highest
bids for that product and limit to products that are auctioned at least 500 times in
our sample.
Table 1 shows summary statistics at the product level. There are 18 distinct products in our sample, and each product category contains 961 auctions on average,
with the number of auctions ranging from 516 to 2,525. As reserve prices increase
revenue only when they lie between the highest and second highest bids, the size
of the gap between these bids is of particular interest. This gap ranges from $8.41
(8.7% of the mean second highest bid) for product 2 to $42 for product 18 (17.7%

THE SIMPLE EMPIRICS OF OPTIMAL ONLINE AUCTIONS

17

of the mean second highest bid). This gap suggests that reserve prices may be able
to increase bids somewhat over a no-reserve auction.
We estimate optimal reserves separately in each product category. We do this
exercise separately for the case where the seller’s outside option (v0 ) for the good
is set to zero and where v0 is set to half of the average second highest bid. Setting
v0



0 will yield the reserve price that will maximize the expected payment of

the winning bidder to the seller ignoring the seller’s outside option, which may
be the quantity that the auction platform is most interested in maximizing, as platform fees are typically proportional to this payment. Setting v0 to some fraction of
the expected second highest bid is perhaps a more realistic representation of the
seller’s perceived value of keeping the good.
In Figure 2, we select one specific product in our sample, product #18, which
is the “Apple iPhone 5 16GB Black-Slate Verizon”. In the figure we plot expected
profit as a function of the reserve price given the empirical distribution of the first
and second highest bids. Panel A considers the setting where v0

 0 and panel

B considers the setting where v0 is half the average second order statistic. Unsurprisingly for a product supplied elastically on other online or offline platforms, the
figure shows that there is a sharp drop-off in profit for reserves beyond a certain
point (about $150 in panel A and about $275 in panel B). This large drop off illustrates a point also discussed in Ostrovsky and Schwarz (2016) and Kim (2013): the
loss from setting a non-optimal reserve price is asymmetric, such that overshooting the optimal reserve has a much larger loss in magnitude than undershooting
it.
The vertical line represents the optimal reserve price computed using the first
and second highest bid distributions. The gain from the optimal reserve over a

 v0 is 0.81% in panel A and 0.86% in panel B. Figures 3 and 4 display
the same measure for each product separately. In Figure 3, when v0  0, the gain
from using the estimated reserve price over setting r  v0 ranges from 0.27% to

reserve of r

0.81%, depending on the product. Similarly, in Figure 4, when v0 is set to half the

We now turn to the question of how close optimal reserve prices will be to those
estimated using a finite history of first and second-highest bids. The theoretical
guarantee of Theorem 4 assures us that estimated reserve prices will eventually
perform close to optimally. We assess this feature through a simulation exercise.

For each product, we draw 1,000 sequences, each of length 250, at random with
replacement from the empirical distribution of all auctions observed for that product over the sample period. Within each sequence, we then estimate the reserve
price suggested by our approach using only the first τ observations in the sequence, doing so separately for each τ

P t1, ..., 250u.

Thus, we begin with only

1 historical auction observation, then 2, then 3, and so on, for each drawn sequence. Next, at each of these estimated reserve prices, using the full sample of
historical observations for the product, we compute the expected profit the seller
would receive from using this computed reserve price. Therefore, for this exercise
we treat the empirical distribution of auctions in our sample as representing the
“true” distribution of first and second highest bids, and we treat sellers as only
having information on a history of τ auctions drawn at random from the full empirical distribution.

progressively incorporating more observations in the sequence in computing the

176, with fewer auctions required to achieve a positive gain in the case where the
seller’s outside option is higher. Given the large data settings in which we see
our approach being the most beneficial, these results are encouraging, as many
popular products accumulate long histories of sales rather quickly.

The large standard deviation in reserve prices in the initial auctions implies that
the reserve prices recommended by optimization on a short history of auctions are
often too high. As seen in Figure 2, this can lead to sharply reduced profit.

5. M YERSON O PTIMAL A UCTION C ASE
We now shift our focus slightly and restrict our attention to asymmetric independent (rather than correlated) private values, to focus on how our approach can be
extended to the setting considered by Myerson (1981). We demonstrate that our
approach to estimating reserves can be extended to estimate the objects required
for implementing the optimal auction (rather than just a single reserve price) in the
case considered by Myerson (1981), that of asymmetric bidders with independent
private values. In this case, we assume that, in addition to observing the top two
bids from auctions without a reserve price, the researcher also observes the identity of the highest bidder (the bidder’s type, t); this is a standard assumption in
asymmetric auctions (Athey and Haile 2007).
Following Bulow and Roberts (1989), we denote the marginal revenue curve of
bidder i with type t as MRt pq. This marginal revenue curve has the same interpretation as in a standard monopoly problem: it is the additional revenue that a
monopoly seller would expect to obtain from the buyer, when facing this buyer in
isolation (in which case demand is given by 1  Ft pvq) by raising the price a small
amount. We assume here that Ft is regular, i.e. that ψt pvq

ing, in which case MRt pvq

In the Myerson (1981) optimal auction, all

bidders report their values and the seller assigns the good to the bidder with the
highest marginal revenue, as long as it exceeds v0 . The winning bidder pays the
least value he could report that would still result in his winning the object, given
all other reported values. That is, if i is the winning bidder and i has type t, i pays
1
MR
t pmax tv0 , maxst t MRs pvs quuq. To implement this auction, it is necessary to

know the marginal revenue functions of each bidder.

5.1. Identifying and Estimating Marginal Revenue Curves. We now describe
how MRt pq can be identified. We first describe the concept of type-specific reserve prices. The feature that the seller assigns the good to the bidder with the
highest marginal revenue as long as it exceeds v0 implies that each bidder faces a

26

COEY, LARSEN, SWEENEY, AND WAISMAN

type-specific reserve price, which we denote rt , given by rt

 MRt 1pv0q. Contin-

uing with the standard monopoly pricing analogy from Bulow and Roberts (1989)
(see also Krishna (2009), p. 67–73), the seller’s value, v0 , can be thought of as the
marginal cost of selling the good, and thus the seller facing demand by a buyer of

type t would choose a price rt such that MRt prt q  v0 .

Now consider a seller designing a second-price auction in which the highest
value bidder was known to be of type t. We will refer to such a second-price
auction as a type-t auction. Let imax



arg maxiPt1,...,nu Vi and denote i’s type as

tpiq. The condition that the highest value bidder being of type t is then denoted
tpimax q

 t. Using similar notation to (3) above, the expected profit of a seller in a

type-t auction is given by


p1q

p2q

pt prt q  E π pVj , Vj , v0 , rt q|tpimax q  t

(6)

The optimal reserve price in this setting can be obtained simply by maximizing (6)
over rt . As highlighted above, arguments in Bulow and Roberts (1989) imply that,
in terms of marginal revenues, a seller designing such an auction should choose a

reserve price such that rt such that MRt prt q  v0 , equivalent to the bidder-specific
reserve prices in the Myerson auction. Therefore, maximizing (6) over rt at different values of v0 will trace out the inverse marginal revenue curve. That is, it will
1
yield rt pv0 q  MR
t pv0 q, and hence will identify the MRt curve.

We state this result as the following observation:
Observation 2. For any type t, the marginal revenue curve MRt pq is identified from

p1q and V p2q from auctions without a reserve price, in which the winner

observations of Vj

was of type t.
To estimate MRt pq, we limit to the Jt auctions in which a type-t bidder was the
winner, and estimate the following for a given value of v0 :

where we explicitly state the dependence of the procedure on v0 in this case. Re-

ˆ 
peating this process for a range of values for v0 yields MR
t pq.

Once marginal revenues have been estimated, the Myerson auction can be implemented for a given set of reported values by determining which bidder has the
highest marginal revenue and determining that bidder’s payment as the lowest
value that bidder could have reported and still won.

5.2. Monte Carlo Simulations: Implementing Myerson’s Optimal Auction. We
now provide Monte Carlo simulations illustrating the approach in the Myerson
case. In these simulations we work with three bidders, although nowhere in the
estimation do we require the researcher to know the number of bidders in any
given auction; we assume for each auction the researcher observes the top two
bids and the identity of the winning bidder.10 We choose each bidder’s values
from a different lognormal distribution: V1
and V3

 LOGNp.5, .25q, V2  LOGNp.75, .25q,

 LOGNp1, .25q. We simulate 10,000 auctions. Kernel density estimates of

the simulated draws are displayed in Panel A of Figure 7.
To illustrate the simplicity of this method and its potential for use even in Big
Data settings, we take a very coarse approach to optimization and estimation, and
still find that it performs quite well. We begin by evaluating (6) on a grid of possible reserve prices for each bidder and choose the maximizing reserve prices. We
perform this step at different values on a grid of v0 , yielding estimates of bidderspecific marginal revenue curves. Panels B–D of Figure 7 displays, for each bidder,
the estimated marginal revenue curve and the true underlying marginal revenue
curve, demonstrating that the estimates coincide quite well with the truth. We
then implement the Myerson (1981) optimal auction using the same simulated data
10Alternatively, one could assume that, for each bidder i, the researcher knows the probability that

i is the winning bidder and knows quantiles of the marginal distributions of the first and second
order statistics from auctions in which i was the winner.

in the Myerson (1981) auction. Figure 8 demonstrates that the gains from implementing a Myerson’s optimal auction (as opposed to a no-reserve auction) can be
nearly twice the gains of implementing a single reserve price, especially at lower
values of the seller’s outside option.
6. C ONCLUSION
We study a computationally simple approach for estimating the single optimal
reserve price in asymmetric, correlated private values settings and for estimating bidder-specific marginal revenue curves in asymmetric, independent private
values settings (in order to implement the Myerson (1981) optimal auction). The
approach applies to settings with incomplete bidding data, where only the top two
bids are observed, and where the number of bidders is unknown. These data requirements are frequently met in online (advertising or e-commerce) settings. We

30

COEY, LARSEN, SWEENEY, AND WAISMAN

also derive a new bound on the number of auction records one needs to observe
in order for realized revenue based on estimated reserve prices to approximate the
optimal revenue arbitrarily closely. We illustrate the approach using eBay data for
cataloged products, and illustrate that revenue would increase if optimal reserve
prices were employed in practice. We find that approximately 7–25 auctions need
to be recorded prior to estimating reserve prices in order for the estimated reserve
price to outperform revenue in a no-reserve auction (or an auction with the reserve
set to the seller’s valuation). In simulated data, we demonstrate the simplicity of
our approach to estimating marginal revenue curves and implementing Myerson’s
optimal auction, and illustrate the revenue gain that this auction design entails.
While the approach abstracts away from a number of information settings or
real-world details (such as common values or inter-auction dynamics), we believe
the virtue of the approach is its simplicity, providing a tractable approach to computing reserve prices even in large, unwieldy datasets where typical computationally demanding empirical auction approaches would be infeasible.
