Trade Diversion and the Initiation Effect: A Case Study of U.S. Trade Remedies in Agriculture
Colin A. Carter and Sandro Steinbach
NBER Working Paper No. 24745
June 2018
JEL No. F12,F14,Q17
ABSTRACT
This paper estimates the impact of U.S. trade remedy (TR) actions on agricultural trade from
1990 to 2014. Most previous studies of the effects of TR actions have left out agricultural
products. We use a four-country oligopolistic trade model to study the impact of TR duties on
imports from non-named countries, and we improve on methodological issues present in earlier
studies. Our empirical results show that TR investigations benefit non-named foreign exporters
and U.S. imports from non-named countries increase even before the implementation of a TR
duty. The extent of trade diversion is positively related to the size of the duty. Moreover, we find
evidence of an initiation effect revealed by a significant increase in imports from non-named
countries that did not previously trade the relevant product with the United States. The
considerable extent of trade diversion in agriculture provides robust evidence for leakage effects
of TR laws which has a detrimental impact on their protective effect.

Introduction

The Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (URAA) was a milestone for the liberalization
of agricultural trade. The agreement helped to reduce trade distortions as it tamed traditional
policy instruments such as tariffs, export subsidies, and import quotas. Although the agreement
contributed to a significant reduction of market distortions, it also fostered the use of alternative
instruments of trade protectionism as many countries still prefer to regulate agricultural markets
and subsidize farmers. The issue gained additional importance in recent years, because developing
and transition countries started to expand their financial support to the farming sector, partly
driven by the fact that developed countries continued to support their farmers (He and Sappideen,
2012). Trade remedy (TR) laws are a prominent example of such an alternative protection mechanism for agriculture. Article VI (GATT, 1994) allows member states to protect their domestic
industry from injuries caused by foreign competitors that price discriminate or export at a price
below production costs.1 Even though TR actions are widely used, their impact on agricultural
trade is poorly understood as studies mostly leave out agriculture (Blonigen, 2004).
The agricultural sector provides an interesting environment to study the impact of TR laws because
this industry has many unique characteristics compared to manufacturing. First, TR duties levied
against agricultural exporters are typically larger than for manufacturing (Blonigen, 2004). For
instance, China’s exporters of fresh garlic to the U.S. face a country-wide duty of 376.67 percent.
Second, the garlic trade example indicates an additional issue that relates to the storability of
agricultural products. While manufactured products are storable for many months or even years,
many agricultural products perish rapidly (Jaffee and Gordon, 1992). Notably, high perishability
is associated with larger transaction costs. Third, the timing of agricultural production decisions is
different from the timing in the manufacturing industry since farmers have to determine their crop
choices months or even years in advance. For instance, environmental regulations and crop rotation
requirements make agricultural supply inelastic and diminish the ability of agricultural producers
to react to trade shocks caused by TR duties. A final issue relates to the ability to adapt in a
changing trade environment which is more difficult for agricultural than manufacturing producers
1

Although countervailing duties are governed by the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, their
application is also regulated by Article VI.

1

because trade standards for agricultural products are usually higher and often involve sanitary and
phytosanitary regulations (Disdier et al., 2008). These characteristics of the agricultural sector
motivate us to study the impacts of TR duties on agriculture.
The interest in TR laws has grown substantially in the course of their proliferation as trade restriction instruments (Cheng et al., 2001; Feinberg and Reynolds, 2006; Zanardi, 2006). Kerr (2006)
argues that these duties are often fraudulently used to suppress imports and support domestic
industries. Not only do TR laws cause trade distortions, but they also hinder further multilateral trade liberalization efforts (Prusa, 2005). The empirical and theoretical literature devoted to
the study of antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) laws is fairly substantial. Yet,
most studies focus solely on manufactures (Staiger and Wolak, 1994; Prusa, 2001, 2005; Bown and
Crowley, 2007; Vandenbussche and Zanardi, 2010), whereas only a few studies are concerned with
agricultural trade (Keithly and Poudel, 2008; Carter and Gunning-Trant, 2010; Li et al., 2011;
Carter and Steinbach, 2013; Carter and Mohapatra, 2013).
The literature has discussed different channels through which TR duties can affect agricultural
trade. First, a duty can destroy trade in the particular product (destruction effect). Second, a duty
can result in larger imports from other countries (diversion effect). Third, an exporter that faces
a duty can increase exports to third countries to compensate for the lost market share (deflection
effect). Fourth, a TR duty can affect downstream or upstream products. Fifth, since trade is
part of a strategic decision process, a country which is continuously exposed to TR investigations,
might avoid trading with the complainant country. This effect is called trade deterrence. Although
various studies have looked at these different aspects, the literature is still far from being conclusive,
particularly when it comes to agricultural trade.
We identified three major empirical limitations in the literature on trade remedies. A first potential
limitation is the level of data aggregation. Most studies use trade data at the 6-digit HS code
level. The aggregation level can blur away the effect of antidumping or countervailing duties
because a 6-digit HS code can cover hundreds of commodities that are not targeted by a particular
ruling and are potential substitutes for the targeted products. Carter and Gunning-Trant (2010)
circumvent this problem by collecting trade data at the detailed 10-digit level of the Harmonized
Tariff Schedule (HTS). Besedeš and Prusa (2017) also use quarterly 10-digit HTS-level import data.

2

In fact, we believe that this level of data detail is necessary to provide meaningful estimates, but
we encountered a further limitation which related to the time consistency of available trade data.
The HTS codes are frequently updated, which can result in inconsistent time series. We solve this
problem by constructing consistent time series with HTS codes that are based on revisions of the
tariff schedule.
A further limitation of earlier studies is the extent of temporal aggregation. Almost all studies use
annual trade data that is either based on a calendar year or constructed based on the date when a
petition was filed.2 Relying on annual data is a limitation because it makes it impossible to identify
the extent of trade diversion that is caused by the different stages of a TR investigation. Instead of
using annual trade data, we exploit variation in monthly import trade data for the United States.
This allows us to measure the extent of trade diversion that is caused by a preliminary duty and
disentangle it from that of the final duty. Moreover, our study is the first to measure the degree
of trade diversion resulting from the initiation of a TR investigation for countries that did not
previously trade with the complainant.
Our paper contributes to the literature on the impact of TR laws by investigating the diversion
effect for the intensive and extensive margins of agricultural trade.3 The analysis relies on a fourcountry oligopolistic trade model with Cournot competition. The theoretical model provides two
testable hypotheses: First, the imposition of a TR duty results in higher imports from non-named
countries (trade diversion); and second, foreign producers from countries that did not export to
the complainant country before the initiation of a TR investigation are incentivized to contest the
market (initiation effect). Our empirical approach is an important improvement over the existing
literature as we pay particular attention to product-level heterogeneity by including a full set of
time and commodity fixed effects. Moreover, we also pay particular attention to econometric
issues that can affect the validity of our estimation results by fitting the regression model with a
maximum likelihood estimator that accounts for zero observations in the data. This is of exceptional
importance for studies that are concerned with the diversion effects of TR duties. Our results
2

3

A benefit of this approach is that it circumvents the problem of zero trade flows. However, doing so wastes much
of the information contained in the trade data.
We deviate from the trade literature in our definition of intensive and extensive trade margins. Usually, the intensive
trade margin refers to the volume of sales per firm, while the extensive trade margin denotes the number of firms
selling in a market. To test our propositions, we define the intensive trade margin as the quantity and value of
imports, while the extensive trade margin refers to the number of trading partners.

provide strong evidence for a significant trade diversion effect along the intensive and extensive
trade margins and indicate that the applied duties have a significant impact on imports from nonnamed countries. Moreover, we also find compelling evidence in support of the initiation effect.
Our empirical results show a considerable increase in imports from non-named countries that did
not previously trade with the United States. This initiation effect is positively associated with the
size of the TR duty.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. After the introduction, the theoretical model
is described and our motivation for the investigation of the trade diversion and initiation effects
is provided. The third section explains our methodology and describes the empirical specification,
estimation strategy, and robustness checks. We discuss the issue of zero trade flows and introduce
an efficient and consistent estimator. The section also discusses data sources and expectations
regarding the parameter signs. The fifth section presents and discusses the regression results. We
analyze the implications of TR laws for the intensive and extensive trade margins. Our conclusions
summarize the study, discuss limitations, and pose questions for further research.

Theoretical Model

TR laws have become an essential instrument of agricultural protectionism in the United States.
The two principal trade remedies are the AD and the CVD law which are both set out in Title VII
of the Tariff Act of 1930. TR duties reduce imports from named countries. Consequently, domestic
producers and non-named foreign producers enjoy a higher price for the targeted product, giving
domestic producers an incentive to expand their production and motivating non-named foreign
producers to increase their exports. Moreover, some foreign producers for whom participation in
the market was noneconomic before the duty was imposed, are now incentivized to step in and
contest the market as they are aware that TR orders tend to remain in place for decades due to
weak sunset reviews.
Most studies that investigate the implications of TR laws do not provide a theoretical motivation
for their empirical work. The choice of a theoretical framework is mainly driven by the market
characteristics. For instance, Bown and Crowley (2007) rely on an oligopolistic competition setting

4

to examine the impacts on third markets. Their model builds on the assumption that the exporting
firm exerts market power in the import market. Although agricultural markets are usually perfectly
competitive at the producer level due to the large number of price-taking primary producers, the
issue of market power is still of relevance because of the characteristics of the food supply chain.
Notably, market concentration beyond the farm gate is typically very high (Howard, 2016). In
particular, agricultural trade is increasingly dominated by a few large trading companies and food
processors. These characteristics of the food supply chain make an oligopolistic competition setting
a suitable environment to study the implications of TR laws. Following Bown and Crowley (2007),
we use the oligopolistic competition setting to illustrate the diversion effects of trade remedies and
demonstrate the initiation effect.4
Assume there are four countries indexed i ∈{A, B, C, D}. In each country, one firm, also indexed
as i, produces one good. Moreover, assume for simplification that firm A only serves its domestic
market, while firms B, C and D serve their domestic market and export to country A. Table 1
illustrates the markets to which each firm can export. The quantity that is produced for domestic
consumption is denoted qi , while exports are denoted qij , where i indicates the country of origin
and j the country in which the good is consumed. Consumers in the importing country consider
the domestically produced good and the imported good as strategic substitutes, i.e., they derive
the same utility from the consumption of either good. We denote total market supply in the home
P
P
market as Qi =
i qij + qj , while
j qji + qi and the supply in the foreign market as Qj =
total output in each country is therefore given by qi∗ = qij + qi . Each firm regards its domestic
market and the foreign market as separated, implying that the quantity in each market is allocated
independently and firms are subject to Cournot perception.5
The same technology is used by each competitor and firms face an inverse demand function denoted
as p(Qi , Yi ), where Yi is a set of demand shifters such income. Production cost in i is represented
by a cost function c(qi∗ , Wi ), where Wi is a set of cost factors that occur with qi∗ . We assume
4

Bown and Crowley (2007) investigate trade deflection and trade depression effects of remedy laws while we study
“trade diversion”. The authors use the notion “trade creation via import source diversification” to denote trade
effects for non-named countries, whereas we follow Carter and Gunning-Trant (2010) and use the term “trade
diversion”. The term trade creation is misleading because trade remedies do not create trade, but rather the
investigating country diversifies its trade relations to compensate the reduction of foreign supply.
Cournot perception implies that the other firms will hold output fixed. We assume a Cournot-Nash equilibrium
instead of a Bertrand-Nash equilibrium because agents regard the domestic and the foreign good as strategic
substitutes. This implies that firms compete in quantities and not in prices.

that marginal costs are strictly convex in qi∗ with c0 (qi∗ , Wi ) > 0 and c00 (qi∗ , Wi ) > 0 which reflects
increasing marginal cost. Now, suppose that there are no other trade costs between i and j than a
tariff τ , where τji denotes a duty that j levied against i. For simplicity we assume that the burden
of the duty falls entirely on the exporter. Thus, the profit function can be expressed in its general
form as follows:

where sales are determined by sales at home and in the foreign country and costs are a function
of the duty and the production cost. A firm’s objective is to maximize its profits by choosing the
quantity of sales in each market such that

max Πi = p(Qi , Yi )qi + p(Qj , Yj )qij − τji qij − c(qi∗ , Wi ).

(2)

If we now assume that country A imposes a duty against country B, the first order conditions for
home markets are given by:
∂ ΠA
∂ qA
∂ ΠB
∂ qB
∂ ΠC
∂ qC

= p(QA , YA ) + p0 (QA , YA )qA − c0 (qA∗ , WA ) ≡ 0

= p(QB , YB ) + p0 (QB , YB )qB − c0 (qB∗ , WB ) ≡ 0

(3b)

= p(QC , YC ) + p0 (QC , YC )qC − c0 (qC∗ , WC ) ≡ 0

(3c)

∗
= p(QD , YD ) + p0 (QD , YD )qD − c0 (qD
, WD ) ≡ 0

(3d)

and the first order conditions for the profit maximizing quantity of exports for firms B, C and D
to country A are:

6

∂ ΠB
= p(QA , YA ) + p0 (QA , YA )qBA − τAB − c0 (qB∗ , WB ) ≡ 0
∂ qBA
∂ ΠC
= p(QA , YA ) + p0 (QA , YA )qCA − c0 (qC∗ , WC ) ≡ 0
∂ qCA
∂ ΠD
∗
= p(QA , YA ) + p0 (QA , YA )qDA − c0 (qD
, WD ) ≡ 0
∂ qDA

(4a)
(4b)
(4c)

The solution to the first order conditions yields each firm’s best reaction (or response) function
with respect to the sales decisions of the other firms, which can be expressed in the general form
for the home market as:
qi = Ri [p(Qi , Yi ), c(qi∗ , Wi )],

(5)

and i’s best reaction function for the foreign market is given by:

qij = Rij [p(Qj , Yj ), τji , c(qi∗ , Wi )].

(6)

Solving the seven best reaction functions simultaneously yields the Cournot-Nash equilibrium quantities which are sold by each firm in each market. Because marginal costs are strictly convex in qi∗ ,
the exporting firms B, C and D will choose to allocate total sales between their home market and
the foreign market so that the net marginal revenue, which is defined as marginal revenue less the
the duty, is the same in the home and the foreign market. This is a crucial assumption because it
forces firms to reallocate their sales across markets when a TR duty is imposed.
The theoretical model allows us to make three propositions regarding the potential effects of TR
actions:
− First, a TR duty levied by country A against exports from firm B causes a decline in B’s exports
to country A which is know as the trade destruction effect.6
− Second, a duty imposed by country A against exports from firm B will cause an increase in firm
C’s exports to country A. This effect is called trade diversion.

6

We do not measure the extent of trade destruction caused by trade remedies in agriculture. This question remains
open for future research.

7

− Third, a TR against firm B motivates firm D to contest the other firms in market A. Here we
rely on the assumption that firm D did not initially export to country A and only served its
domestic market before the duty was imposed against firm B, implying that the costs of entering
market A were larger than the benefits. The duty raised the price of the good in country A,
which made it profitable for firm D to contest the market in country A. We call this the initiation
effect. The propositions can be proved by totally differentiating the first order conditions and
applying Cramer’s rule after dividing by τAB . We find for firm A that
find for firm B that

The model allows us to analyze the trade diversion and initiation effects for the intensive and
extensive trade margins. The terms intensive and extensive trade margins are traditionally used
to distinguish the patterns of international trade at the firm level. In our case, the intensive trade
margin refers to the quantity and value of imports, while the extensive trade margin denotes the
number of trading partners. Although we would prefer to investigate the propositions with firm
level data, such detailed data are not available. Therefore, our notion of the intensive trade margins
derives from the oligopolistic trade model, where we assume that only one firm operates in each
home market. The notion of an extensive trade margin also relates to the oligopolistic trade model,
but we have to assume that firm C did not export to country A prior to the duty. Hence, a change
in the extensive trade margin due to a TR duty would be reflected in a lower or higher number of
trading partners.

Data and Empirical Approach

3.1

Data

TR investigations
TR investigations in the U.S. always follows the same predefined procedure. Although the statuary
timetable of an AD investigation is similar to the timetable of a CVD investigation, both procedures
differ in terms of time required to complete the different stages of the investigation.7 Typically an
industry, or some group representing an industry (e.g., a trade association), simultaneously files a
petition with the Commerce Department’s International Trade Administration (ITA) and with the
International Trade Commission (ITC). In order for duties to be levied against foreign firms, the
ITA must determine that goods have been sold at less than fair value (LTFV) and the ITC must
determine that the domestic industry has been or is threatened with material injury by reason of
dumped or subsidized imports. It is noteworthy that each AD petition is filed against firms in
a single country. However, if the domestic industry believes that several countries have sold at
LTFV, it will simultaneously file a petition against groups of firms in each country. A multiple
petition filing increases the likelihood of an affirmative injury decision because the ITC follows the
7

Figures A1 and A2 in the Appendix provide a detailed overview of the different stages of a TR investigation.

9

“cumulation principle” when making the injury decision. The cumulation principle allows the ITC
to consider the total volume of allegedly dumped imports from all named countries.
Once the petition has been filed, the ITA and ITC make a series of decisions. Within 45 days
the ITC makes a preliminary injury decision. If this decision is negative, the case is terminated.
Review of ITC cases suggests that the material injury standard is lower at the preliminary stage
than at the final decision, and therefore cases terminated at the preliminary injury stage do not
appear to have merit (Moore, 1988). The purpose of the preliminary determination is to filter out
“frivolous” petitions. If the ITC’s preliminary decision is affirmative, the ITA makes a preliminary
LTFV decision within 160 days and then a final LTFV decision within 75 days of its preliminary
decision. A final LTFV determination is made regardless of the preliminary decision (i.e., the ITA’s
preliminary decision does not terminate the investigation). The chief purpose of the preliminary
LTFV decision is to set a temporary bond rate that is in effect until the case is officially resolved.
The bond grants the domestic industry temporary protection for the course of the investigation.
If the respondents lose, the bond is forfeit. If the ITA’s final decision is affirmative, the ITC must
make its final injury decision no longer than 75 days after the ITA’s final determination of the duty
size. If the ITC’s final decision is affirmative, duties are collected for a period of no less than two
years. If the ITC’s final decision is negative, the case is terminated and any bond paid during the
course of the investigation is refunded to the respondents.
In this paper, we explore the variation in the timing of TR investigations to quantify the trade
diversion and investigation effects. We obtained detailed information on the timing of all TR investigations from the ITC. Their database contains information on each agricultural investigation filed
between 1990 and 2014. We use their database as a starting point to identify the relevant stages
of each TR investigation. For this purpose, we rely on the U.S. Federal Register which publishes
detailed information on the timing of each investigation and information on the scope (HTS codes).
Overall, we identified 30 TR investigations that led to an affirmative final decision. These investigations are summarized in Table A1 in the Appendix. Most investigations were initiated against
developing countries and only few against developed countries. For each investigation, we obtained
information on the scope and the timing of the major investigation stages (initiation, preliminary
duty, and final duty). These measures allow us to draw inferences for each period of an investigation

10

and to deconstruct the investigation effect.8 We are able to decompose the investigation effect for
the different stages of a TR investigation because we rely on highly disaggregated trade data that
are collected for every month of the investigation period.
Trade Data
Our monthly trade data are from the U.S. Imports of Merchandise Trade published by the Census
Bureau. The import trade data are recorded at the 10-digit HTS level and cover the period January
1990 to December 2014. The dataset includes information on trade values, shipped quantities, and
collected duties at the port level. For our analysis, we consider imports for consumption, which
measures the total value of merchandise that physically clears customs and goods withdrawn from
customs bonded warehouses or U.S. Foreign Trade Zones. These products enter the consumption
channels immediately. Notably, the data do not include goods that are held in bonded warehouses.
A potential issue with detailed import trade data is the frequent revision of HTS codes (Pierce
and Schott, 2012). Particular commodities that face a TR investigation are frequently reclassified
to better account for product heterogeneity. To account for these changes, we construct consistent
synthetic HTS codes that reflect changes of the tariff schedule over time. For this purpose, we
rely on the approach outlined by Pierce and Schott (2012). The synthetic HTS codes allow us to
disentangle the duty effect and account for breaks in the trade data series. The procedure is applied
to all 30 affirmative TR investigations investigated in this paper. We find that each investigation
has a minimum of one HTS code that changes over the course of a TR investigation.
Control variables
We follow the TR literature and include additional control variables. We use a measures of the gross
domestic product to capture country effects. Moreover, we account for domestic and foreign supply
with measures of total agricultural output. To account for price effects, we include the consumer
price index in our regression model. Furthermore, the census trade data allow us to calculate
the paid tariff and transportation costs. We include these parameters as further covariates. All
covariates are derived from databases maintained by the U.S. Census Office, the U.N. Food and
8

Staiger and Wolak (1994) argue that the initiation of a TR investigation investigation reduces imports from targeted
countries which could increase imports from non-targeted countries. This perspective is supported in Prusa (2001)
who argues that the initiation of an investigation influences firm’s decisions. The claim finds further support in
Carter and Gunning-Trant (2010).

regression analysis.

3.2

Empirical approach

We use a reduced form regression model to estimate the diversion and initiation effects of U.S.
TR investigations in agriculture.9 The empirical analysis extends from two years prior–to three
years after–the initiation of a TR investigation.10 Our baseline regression specification accounts
for unobserved factors with case and time fixed effects. In contrast to earlier studies, we do not
rely on a double-log regression model to identify the parameters of interest (Prusa, 2001; Bown
and Crowley, 2007; Carter and Gunning-Trant, 2010), but instead, we use a count data model that
allows us to account for zero observations in the trade data. Our baseline specification is given in
its generalized form as follows:

Ikt = exp αk + αt +

3
X


γp ln(τc )Pp + X it γ x  ηkt ,

(7)

p=1

where k denotes an 8- or 10-digit HTS product, t time in months, and p the stages of a TR
investigation. The dependent variable Ikt maps into three different specifications. We capture
the intensive trade margin by the value (vkt ) and the quantity (qkt ) of consumption imports,
while the extensive trade margin is quantified by the number of trading partners (nkt ). Our
preferred regression specification includes fixed effects for the HTS codes and each month of a TR
investigation. To ensure the robustness and sensitivity of our empirical approach, we compare
different combinations of fixed effects.11 Depending on the regression specification, we include a
9

We dropped trade events with countries named in a TR investigation. The aggregated response of the non-named
countries is the outcome of interest. Therefore, we aggregate imports from all other countries to reveal the trade
diversion and initiation effects.
10
The beginning of an investigation is defined by the date when a domestic industry files a petition. To give an
example, a petition was filed on February 28, 1994 on behalf of the Fresh Garlic Producers Association. The
preliminary duty was imposed on July 7, 1994 and the final decision was announced on September 26, 1994.
11
For the baseline specification, we compare nine different combinations of fixed effects. We include fixed effects for
quarters and years in specification (1), for the investigation months in specification (2), for the cases in specification
(3), for the HTS codes in specification (4), for the quarters, years, and investigation months in specification (5),
for the quarters, years, and cases in specification (6), for the quarters, years, and HTS codes in specification (7),
for the investigation months and cases in specification (8), and for the investigations months and HTS codes in
specification (9), respectively.

code level over time. These control variables are the gross domestic products, the domestic and
foreign supply (measured by the global and U.S. agricultural output), the U.S. consumer price
index, the tariff rate, and transport costs. We denote the multiplicative error term with ηit . The
key parameters of interest are denoted by γp . These shift parameters account for the main stages
of a TR investigation (initiation, preliminary duty, and final duty). Moreover, to account for the
impact of the duty rate, we interact the preliminary and final duties with the dummies for the
different stages of the TR investigation. Lastly, we also specify an autoregressive regression model
to account for the dependency of imports over time. For this specification, we follow the literature
and assume that imports in one month depend on imports in the previous month (Prusa, 2001;
Bown and Crowley, 2007; Carter and Gunning-Trant, 2010).
To empirically explore the relationship between our variables of interest and the count outcomes,
we use the Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PML) estimator (Gong and Samaniego, 1981;
Gourieroux et al., 1984). The Poisson PML estimator is consistent in the presence of heteroskedasticity, and even if the conditional variance is not proportional to the conditional mean, the Poisson
PML estimator is consistent (Wooldridge, 1999; Cameron and Trivedi, 2013). Because the estimator
does not assume anything about the dispersion of the fitted values, we do not test for this aspect.
An advantage of the Poisson PML estimator is that the scale of the dependent variable has no
effect on the parameter estimates, which is a challenge for the Negative Binomial PML estimator.
Moreover, as long as the conditional mean is correctly specified, the Poisson PML estimator yields
estimates that are similar in size to the estimates of both the Gaussian and Negative Binomial
PML estimators. Lastly, to address heteroskedasticity in the error term, we use a robust variance
estimator and account for clustering at the investigation level (Cameron and Miller, 2015).

Results

We start by summarizing our findings regarding trade diversion. We compare two model specifications to capture the trade effect of TR investigations. First, we account for differences in the trade
diversion effect across the main stages of a TR investigation (initiation, preliminary duty, and final
duty) using dummies for the investigation stages. Second, we interact these period dummies with
the applied duty rates to account for differences in the TR effect according to the duty size. We
then measure the initiation effect by analyzing imports from countries that did not trade with the
United States before the initiation of the TR investigation. We focus on the estimation results for
our preferred regression specification which interacts the period dummies with the applied remedy
duties.

4.1

Trade diversion effect

Our estimation results show that trade remedies have a significant effect on imports from nonnamed countries. The regression results for the empirical specification with period dummies for
the different stages of a TR investigation are presented in Table 2. The table shows the coefficient
estimates for the regression specification with month and HTS code fixed effects.12 We present
the estimates for the baseline specification in columns 2-4 and add the first temporal lag of the
dependent variables as a further regressor in columns 5-7. We study the trade diversion effect for
the intensive margin by analyzing the import quantity (1) and value (2), and the extensive margin
by focusing on the number of trading partners (3). According to our theoretical model, we can
expect an increase of imports from non-named countries after the imposition of a TR duty. Our
empirical results are largely in support of this hypothesis as the coefficient estimates are positive
and highly significant for the baseline specification. Although we find that the standard errors are
larger when including the lagged dependent variable, the coefficient estimates convey the same
picture. Moreover, we find that the trade diversion effect is different for the quantity and value
specifications (intensive margins). Although we find strong evidence for trade diversion in the value

The detailed regression results for the model specifications with different combinations of fixed effects are presented
in the Tables A2, A4, and A6 in the Appendix. Overall, the estimation results for the trade diversion effect are
fairly stable across regression specifications.

specification, we only find limited statistical evidence in the quantity specification. This difference
implies that firms in non-named countries do not significantly increase their export volumes to the
United States after the initiation of a remedy investigation, but rather increase the price of their
products. We also find robust statistical evidence for a diversification of import source after the
initiation of a remedy investigation which is indicated by the positive and statistically significant
coefficient estimates for the extensive margin (number of trading partners). Overall, the estimates
provide strong evidence of a significant trade diversion effect along the intensive and extensive
trade margins.

Our estimation results also indicate that the size of the duty determines the degree of trade
diversion. Table 3 summarizes the regression results for the duty specification.13

Instead of

including period dummies in the regression specification, we now include the interaction between
period dummies and the preliminary and final duty rates. This table is organized in the same
fashion as Table 2. Our regression results show that the initiation of a TR investigation has
a significant and lasting effect on imports from non-named countries.

with the specification that includes the first temporal lag of the dependent variable, we find
that both specifications convey a similar picture regarding the significance level and size of the effect.

Notably, the coefficient estimate for the investigation effect is larger for the intensive margin than
for the extensive margin. More specifically, we find that the effect is almost double in size for
the quantity, compared to the value specification. Our findings imply that the assumption of our
theoretical model regarding market structure (Cournot competition) is appropriate. Moreover, the
interaction between the period dummies and the duty rates are largely significant and positive.
The significant estimates indicate that the duty rate is a driving factor of trade diversion. Our
estimation results also show that the larger the applied duty is, the stronger the trade diversion
effect. The trade diversion effect is more pronounced when the final duty comes into force than
when the preliminary duty is effective. This is because uncertainty is resolved and transactions
costs are reduced. Overall, the estimates provide strong evidence for a significant trade diversion
effect along the intensive and extensive trade margins and indicate that the applied duty rate has
a substantial effect on import trade with non-named countries.

Initiation effect

Table 4 summarizes the regression results for the initiation effect and the duty specification.14
We focus on the duty specification because this specification allows us to account for the impact
of the duty size. The regression results indicate that a TR investigation has a strong and lasting
impact on trade with non-named countries that were not previously trading partners with the
U.S. for the relevant product. We find that the initiation of a remedy investigation leads to a
significant increase in imports from non-named countries and a substantial diversification of trade
relationships.

Again, we find evidence for a stronger diversion effect in the quantity specification which implies that
firms mainly compete in quantities (Cournot competition) and not in prices (Bertrand competition).
The estimates are about 1.5 times as large for the quantity versus the value specification. These
findings apply to the baseline specification and to the specification which includes the first temporal
lag of the dependent variable. Notably, we also find substantial evidence for the initiation effect
in the extensive margin. Including the first temporal lag of the dependent variable does not alter
the regression results significantly. Moreover, we find that the applied duty has a substantial trade

diversion effect. This effect is more significant for the intensive margins than for the extensive
margins. Overall, our regression results provide strong empirical evidence for the initiation effect
which we argued for in our theoretical model. The degree of trade diversion is influenced by the
duty size, which is also consistent with our theoretical assumptions.

Conclusions

Our paper highlights two essential properties of trade implications caused by TR laws in agriculture
using detailed U.S. import trade data. First, our empirical investigation shows that TR duties result
in a substantial degree of trade diversion. We find that trade diversion is present in the intensive and
extensive trade margins and is influenced by the duty size. Although our findings are qualitatively
in line with earlier studies on the diversion effects of TR actions (Carter and Gunning-Trant, 2010;
Prusa, 1997), we find evidence of a stronger diversion effect, mainly when interacting the applied
TR duties with the different TR investigation stages. Moreover, our estimates of the investigation
effect are substantially smaller than the estimates presented in earlier studies. We believe that
these differences are mainly due to methodological limitations in previous studies that result in an
overestimation of the investigation effect. Second, we find substantial evidence for the existence of
an initiation effect which is revealed by the significant increase in imports from non-named countries
that did not export the relevant product to the U.S. before the TR investigation. The initiation
effect is strongly related to the duty size and higher duties lead to more trade diversion through
the initiation effect.
We acknowledge some limitations of our study design. The first issue relates to the scope of our
analysis, as we are focusing on TR investigations initiated by the agricultural industry in the United
States. This selection is limiting because the U.S. is a developed economy which sources a significant
share of its food imports from emerging countries. A second issue relates to heterogeneous effects
of trade diversion across countries. One can expect that non-named developed economies are more
capable of filling in for named countries because their food industry has a larger export capacity.
Hence, we should expect stronger trade diversion potential with developed than with developing
countries. The third issue relates to the role of sunset reviews that are usually conducted every

18

five years. Our trade data suggest that a sunset review leads to an increase in trade with named
countries as some of the firm-specific duties are lowered due to the review. To our knowledge,
there is no literature on this issue which makes it an interesting area for future research. Lastly, we
would like to address the issue of firm heterogeneity. The applied duty is time variant for most firms
which implies not only different transactions costs but also different cost structures which allows
these firms to apply to the ITC for a lower duty rate. Firm-specific trade data would provide more
precise estimates of the dynamics of TR investigations. In summary, our paper provides valuable
insights into an important agricultural trade policy issue. We show evidence that TR duties cause
a substantial amount of trade diversion in agriculture which lowers the level of protection provided
by TR laws.
