Real Rigidities and the Non-Neutrality of Money

ABSTRACT

Rigidities in real prices are not sufficient to create rigidities in
nominal prices and real effects of nominal shocks. And, by themselves, snail
frictions in nominal adjustment, such as costs of changing, prices, create only

small non—neutralities.

But this paper shows that substantial nominal

rigidity can arise from a combination of real rigidities and small nominal
frictions. The paper shows the connection between real and nominal rigidity

given the presence of nominal frictions both in general and for several
specific sources of real rigidity: costs of adjusting real prices, asymmetric
demand arising front imperfect information, and efficiency wages.

I. INTRODUCTION

According to Keynesian economics, nominal wages and prices are rigid, and
so nominal

disturbances have real effects. Researchers have presented a wide

of explanations for wage and price rigidities; examples include implicit

contracts,

customer

markets,

social

custoiii.s,

efficiency

wages,

insider/outsider models, inventory models, and theories of countercyclical
markups under imperfect competition.1 These explanations have a common weakness, however: they are theories of real rather than nominal rigidities. That

is, they attempt to explain why real wages or prices are unresponsive to
changes in economic activity. Real rigidity does not imply nominal rigidity:

without an independent source of nominal stickiness, prices adjust fully to
nominal shocks regardless of the extent of real rigidities.

The purpose of this paper is to show that real rigidities nonetheless
have a crucial role in explaining nominal rigidities and the non-neutrality of

nominal shocks.

While real rigidities alone are not sufficient, nominal

rigidities can be explained by a combination of real rigidities and small
frictions in nominal adjustment.

'For implicit contracts, see for example Azariadis (1975) and Baily (19711);

for customer markets, Okun (1982); for social customs, Akerlof (1980) and
Boner (1981!); for efficiency wages, Solow (1979), Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984),
and Bulow and Summers (1986); for insider/outsider models, Lindbeck and Snower

(1986); for inventories, Blinder (1982); and for countercyclical markups,
Stiglitz (1984), Rotemberg and Saloner (1986), and Bils (1986, 1987).

parameter values; for example, labor supply must be highly elastic.

As a

result, firms and workers choose only a small degree of rigidity, and nominal
shocks have only small real effects.

We reverse these results by adding real rigidities to a model with a cost

of changing nominal prices.

Both the degree of nominal rigidity caused by

this friction and the resulting welfare loss are increasing in the degree of

real rigidity. Substantial real rigidity implies a large amount of nominal
rigidity even if the cost of changing prices is small.2'3

The intuition behind these results is the following. Rigidity of prices

2Akerlof and Yellen (1985) show that nominal rigidity can result from "near—
rational" behavior rather than costs of adjusting prices. Our central point
carries over to their model: a greater degree of real rigidity implies that a
greater degree of nominal rigidity can arise from a given departure from full
rationality.

3Blanciard (1987a, b) also argues that real rigidities increase the real effects of nominal disturbances.

its nominal price, given that other nominal prices are unchanged, is less

than the cost of changing prices. But a change in one firm's nominal price

when other nominal prices are fixed is a change in the firm's real price.
Further, if other prices do not change, then the nominal shock affects real

aggregate demand. Thus nominal rigidity is an equilibrium if a firm's gain

from adjusting its real price in response to the change in real aggregate
demand is less than the cost of changing prices. If the firm desires only a
small change in its real price -—

In this model, imperfectly competitive price setters face a

small cost of changing prices -- a

"menu cost." We show that the degree of

nominal rigidity is increasing in the degree of real rigidity

under broad con-

ditions.

Section III shows that nominal frictions alone are not sufficient for
large non-neutralities. We present a specific example of the general model of

Section II in which imperfect competition and the menu cost are the only
departures from Walrasian assumptions. We show that for plausible

parameter

values the model implies only small nominal rigidities.

The following three sections illustrate the general relation between real

and nominal rigidity. In

each case, we add a specific source of real rigidity

4

to the model of Section III and show that large non—neutralities can result.

Section IV presents our simplest example, in which we add an ad hoc cost of

adjusting real prices to the small fixed cost of adjusting nominal prices.

Section V presents a model in which the real rigidities have firm
microeconomic foundations.

Specifically, we combine our basic model with a

model of imperfect information and customer markets based on Stiglitz (1979,
1984) and Woglom (1982). Real rigidity arises from an asymmetry in the demand

curve facing a seller. Finally, Section VI considers real wage rigidity that
arises when firms pay efficiency wages. This example is motivated by the common belief that the labor market is an important source of real rigidities.

Section VII offers concluding remarks.

simply to introduce a downward-sloping aggregate demand curve -- a negative
relation between Y and P. Our results would not change if, following Blanchard
and Kiyotaki, we introduced money by adding real balances to utility. In addition, while we assume below that fluctuations in aggregate demand arise from

fluctuations in money, it would be straightforward to introduce velocity

The EQuilibrium Degree of Nominal Rigidity

We measure nominal rigidity through the following experiment.

Assume

that 14 is random. The distribution of 14 is continuous, symmetric around one,

increasing for }K1, and decreasing for 1*1. All agents know the distribution.
Each agent

sets a nominal price before 14 is realized and then, after observing

14, has the

option of paying the menu costz and adjusting his price. We solve

To understand the connection between x and

it,

recall

that nominal

rigidity is an equilibrium if an agent does not adjust his nominal price to a

nominal shock given that others do not adjust. As explained in the introduction, non-adjustment along with the others implies a constant real price, and

the others' behavior implies that the nominal shock affects real aggregate
demand; thus nominal rigidity is an equilibrium if an agent does not adjust
his real price when demand shifts. An increase in real rigidity means that an

demand.

smaller;

When the desired change is smaller, the cost of forgoing it is
thus a menu cost is sufficient to prevent adjustment for a wider

range of shocks.6

D. The Welfare Losses from Nominal Rigidity

Since real rigidity increases nominal rigidity, it increases the economic

fluctuations resulting from shocks to nominal aggregate demand.

Keynesians

believe not only that such fluctuations are large, but also that they are

Thus multiple equilibria require
sufficient real rigidity (mci), and greater real rigidity increases the range

of multiple equilibria.

Intuitively, multiple equilibria arise from

"strategic complementarity" in price—setting: an agent's desired nominal price
depends positively on others' prices, and so adjustment by others increases
his incentive to adjust. Real rigidity raises the degree of strategic complernentarity -- when agents want stable real prices, their desired nominal
prices are closely tied to others' prices.

11

highly inefficient -- and thus that reducing them through demand stabilization

is highly desirable. We now show that real rigidities strengthen this view:
greater real rigidity implies greater welfare losses from equilibrium nominal

rigidity. As we show in the next section, this result is important because
the clearest failure of menu cost models without real rigidities is an inability to generate fluctuations with significant welfare costs.

To simplify our welfare analysis, we modify the experiment of the previous section: following Ball and Romer (1987a), we assume that an agent must

decide whether to pay the menu cost before he observes the money supply. If
the agent pays, he can always adjust his price ex post; if he does not pay,
his price is always rigid. In other words, the degree of nominal rigidity is

a zero—one variable. As in our earlier paper, this simplification does not
affect the qualitative results.

In this version of the model, one can show that (complete) rigidity is an
equilibrium if

Comparing (11) with (7) shows that 4:E[01—1)2] replaces

x2:(M—1)2 in the ex-

pression for the private cost. In choosing between rigidity and flexibility

ex ante, agents compare the menu cost to the expected private loss from
rigidity, which is increasing in the variance of money.

The welfare loss from equilibrium rigidity depends on the relation of PC

to the "social cost" of rigidity: the difference between E[W()] when all

agents pay the menu cost and when none pays.

Recall that nominal rigidity is an equilibrium as long as the private cost

does not exceed z.

This implies that the largest possible social cost of

equilibrium rigidity is H tines z. Since the losses from

rigidity disappear

crrO, Hz is also the maximum gain from stabilizing nominal
aggregate
demand. Thus, for a given menu cost z, the welfare cost of rigidity and the
when

gains from demand stabilization are increasing in H. As discussed in Ball and
Roner (1987a), R can be greater than one -- the
social cost of nominal
rigidity can exceed the private cost -— because
rigidity has a negative externality.

Rigidity in one agent's price contributes to rigidity in the ag-

gregate price level. Greater price level rigidity

causes larger fluctuations

in real aggregate demand, which harms all agents.

The

size of H, like the degree of nominal rigidity, does not depend

13

solely on the degree of real rigidity but is linked to it in important ways.
Consider first an increase in real rigidity caused by an increase in -W22. As

described above, this reduces the private cost of nominal rigidity -— the gain

from adjusting to a shock if others do not adjust.

In contrast, the social

cost of nominal rigidity is unaffected (W22 does not appear in the expression
for SC).

Intuitively, real rigidity is irrelevant to the difference in wel-

fare when all prices adjust and when none adjusts because all real prices are

one in both cases.

Thus real rigidity increases the ratio of social to

private costs of nominal rigidity by reducing the denominator while leaving
the numerator unchanged.

The effect of an increase in real rigidity caused by a decrease in 4112 is

more complicated. A lower 12 like a higher -W22, reduces the private cost
of rigidity. But in principle it can affect the social cost as well. Nominal

rigidity affects not only the variance of output, as we emphasize, but also
the mean. This follows from the deviation of the price level under stickiness

from the certainty equivalent level (see our 1987a paper for details). The
effect of rigidity on mean output depends on

in a complicated way; as a

result, reducing W12 has in general an ambiguous effect on R. In the specific
models of this paper, however, the effect of rigidity on mean output is unim-

portant. Ignoring this effect, a smaller j2 has the same implications as a
larger —W22: 11 rises because its denominator falls and its numerator is unchanged.

III. A SIMPLE YEOMAN FARMER MODEL

This section

considers one example of the class of models studied above:

the "yeoman farmer" model of Ball and Romer (1987a,b). Aside from imperfect
competition and the menu cost, the model's assumptions

are Walrasian. We show

that both the degree of nominal rigidity and the welfare loss from rigidity
are small for plausible parameter values; thus menu costs are not enough to

produce large real effects of money. The model of this section is also the
basis for Sections lY—VI: in each of these, we add a specific source of real
rigidity to the model and show that large non—neutralities can result.
A. The Model7

The agents in this model are a continuum of

farmers indexed by i and dis-

tributed uniformly between i:O and ii. Each farmer uses his own labor to
produce a differentiated good, then sells this product and purchases the
products of all other farmers. Farmer i's utility function is

Cii is farmer i's consumption of the product of farmer j, c is the elasticity

creasing marginal disutility of labor ('p1). The coefficient on Li is chosen

so that equilibrium output neglecting menu costs is one, as in our general
model.

measures the degree of increasing marginal disutility of labor.

rigidity is seven tenths of a percent of revenue, which appears nonnegligible.

(If the change in money is three rather than five percent, the

private cost is three tenths of a percent of revenue.) Thus, while it is dif-

ficult to determine "realistic" values for costs of adjusting nominal prices,
trivial costs would not be sufficient to prevent adjustment in this example)0

In any case, the welfare result is very clear. When both the markup and the

Table I shows that it is difficult to reverse these results. Since the
private cost of rigidity is decreasing in both the markup and the labor supply

Since

are reluctant to vary their hours of work, they have a strong Incen-

tive to adjust their wages (equal to their product prices in our yeoman farmer

model) when demand changes. Large private gains from flexibility imply that
farmers pay
small,

the

menu cost after a nominal shock unless the shock is very

and thus that only small shocks affect output and welfare.

11Two changes in the model would strengthen these results. First, following
Bali and Rorer (1987a), we could introduce risk aversion in consumption. As—

relative risk aversion utility with a risk aversion coef-

(a

typical estimate; see for example Mankiw, 1981) raises the
private cost of rigidity to 1.2% of revenue and reduces R to 1.1. Second, by
assiaing self—employment, we have implicitly assumed that labor is immobile.

As we describe in Section VI, introducing labor mobility increases the private
gains

froe price adjustment.

If mobility is perfect, the effects are

dramatic: the private cost of non—adjustment is 38% of revenue and R is 0.015.

IV. AN AD HOC MODEL OF REAL RIGIDITY

specific source of real rigidity to the yeoman farmer model.

Following Rotemberg

(1982), we could interpret k(—1)2 as the cost of upsetting customers through
unstable

prices; this cost might be lost sales in a future period that is not

explicitly in the model.12

Alternatively, we could interpret

Pj

as the cost of violating a social custom about "fair" prices (see
Akerlof, 1980, and Homer, 1984).13

Not surprisingly, the degree of real rigidity is increasing in the cost of ad-

justing real prices, and real prices become completely rigid as the cost approaches infinity.

To determine the relation between real and nominal rigidity, we substitute the derivatives of (24) into (8) and (14):

12Rotemberg assumes that customers dislike instability in nominal prices,
and therefore specifies a quadratic cost of adjusting nominal prices. In the
absence of money illusion, however, customers care only about real prices. We
adopt a quadratic functional form because presumably large real price changes
upset customers more than small changes. In contrast, it is realistic to as—

While these results show that the necessary amount of real rigidity is
large, they do not determine whether this much rigidity is realistic. Our ad
hoc model does not tie the degree of real rigidity to parameters of tastes or

technology that we can estimate. The literature on customer

markets, social

customs, and so on suggests that the costs of adjusting real prices may be
large --

certainly

there is no presumption that they are trivial, as with the

costs of adjusting nominal prices. Research has not gone far enough, however,

to produce quantitative estimates of the resulting real rigidity. We return
to the issue of how much real rigidity can be

generated by realistic models in

the following sections.

V. IMPERFECT INFORMATION AND CUSTOMER MARKETS

A. Overview

This section studies a version of our yeoman farmer model in which real
price rigidity is based on microeconomic foundations. The source of rigidity
is an asymmetry in the effects
on demand of price increases and decreases that
has

been explored

sumption is that

by Stiglitz (1979, 1984) and Woglom (1982). The central as—

changes in a firm's price are observed

by the firm's current

customers but not by other consumers. If the firm raises its price, it loses
sales both because some of its customers leave for other sellers and because

23

its remaining customers buy less. If the firm lowers its price, it sells more
to current customers, but it does not attract other firms' customers, because
they do not observe the lower price.

To introduce this asymmetry in demand, we modify our basic model by as-

suming that each of the goods in the economy is produced by many farmers
rather than by one, and that each farmer sells to a group of customers rather

this case below.)

Part B of this section presents the revised model. Part C derives the
demand curve facing a farmer and shows that it

is asymmetric. Part D shows

that the asymmetry in demand leads to real price rigidity. Finally, Part E
demonstrates the link between real and nominal rigidity in this example.
B. Assumptions

There is a continuum of differentiated goods, each produced by a continuum of farmers. Goods are indexed

by j and

distributed

uniformly on the

interval; farmers are indexed by j and k and distributed uniformly on the

unit square. We let ir(j,k) denote a point in the unit square.

Each farmer

consumes all products but purchases a given product from only

farmer, his "home seller" of that good.

A farmer observes the prices of

his home sellers. He does not observe other individual prices, but he knows

the distribution of prices for each good.

In his role as a seller, each

farmer is the home seller of a continuum of farmers, his customers.
producer

Each

of good j begins as the home seller of an equal proportion of all

farmers.
As in

the

our other models, each seller sets a nominal price before observing

money stock, and then, after H is revealed, can adjust by paying the menu

cost. After prices are determined, each farmer chooses whether to leave each
of his home sellers for another seller of the same product. For simplicity,

we assume that this search is costless, but that a farmer can search for a
seller of a given product only once: if the farmer leaves his home seller, he
is assigned to another and can neither search again nor return to his original

home seller. (Our results would not change if we introduced a search cost and

allowed farmers to choose how many times to search.) If a farmer leaves his
home

seller of a given product, he has an equal chance of being assigned to

each

other seller of the product.

We introduce heterogeneity in tastes by modifying the utility function,

The important change in the utility function is the addition of the 8ij' to

In words, farmer its utility gain from one unit of

product j provided by his hone seller equals his gain from

arising from location, service, and the like.

For simplicity, a farmer is in-

different among all sellers of a given product who are not his home seller.

function, F('), which is the same for all j.

We also assume that the mean of

8, is greater than one and that the density function of

f('), is

symmetric around 8 and single-peaked. The assumption that 8 Is greater than
one means that, all else equal, most buyers prefer to remain with their home

sellers. This (plausible) assumption is necessary for imperfect information
to lead to asymmetric demand.

If 8 had mean one, then half of a farmer's

customers would leave if he charged a real price of one, and this would imply
that price decreases save as many customers as price increases drive away.

Aside from the modifications described here, the model is the same as in
Section III.

Product Demand

The first step in studying this version of the model is to derive the
demand curve facing an individual seller. We focus on the case in which all
other sellers in the economy charge a real price of one; the analysis below
requires only the results for this case.

A farmer sells to two groups of customers: original customers who remain

with him after they observe his price, and customers of other sellers who
leave and are assigned to him. An original customer stays if this maximizes
his utility gain per unit of expenditure. The utility function, (28), and the

As in Stiglitz and Woglom, imperfect information is the source of asym-

not attract new customers, because customers of other sellers do not observe
it. The details of the results are more complicated than in previous papers,
however. Stiglitz and Woglora assume that a firm retains all

There are two limiting cases of our model. The first is f(1):f'(l)rO,
which implies that all customers remain with a farmer if his price is in the
neighborhood of one. In this case, flre, p:O, and the demand function reduces

farmer's price do not affect his number of customers, and so price affects
demand only because customers substitute the farmer's product for other goods.

greater nominal rigidity, and complete real rigidity arising from kinked
demand implies complete nominal rigidity.16 In terms of our general model,
*
one can show that increases in p raise x
and R because (like increases in k
in the previous section) they increase -W22 while leaving W12 unchanged --

the

bend in the demand curve makes a seller's utility more concave in his price.

As in Section III, one can compute the private cost of nominal rigidity

and R for various parameter values. The main qualitative result is the same
as before: a large degree of real rigidity is necessary for a large R. It is
again difficult to determine how much real rigidity is realistic, because we
do not know realistic values for p, the sharpness of the bend in the demand

16Stiglitz and Woglom argue that kinked demand can lead to nominal rigidity
without referring explicitly to nominal frictions, which suggests that real
rigidities alone can cause nominal rigidity. Nominal frictions are implicit

in the Stiglitz-Woglom argument, however.
Neglecting menu costs, kinked
demand curves imply multiple real equilibria —— for example, each firm will
raise its price a small amount if all others do (this leaves relative prices
unchanged but reduces real money). Crucially, nominal disturbances do not af—
feet the set of real equilibria. Stiglitz and
Woglom argue informally that
nominal disturbances may move the economy from one real equilibrium to another
-- for example, if nominal
money falls and prices do not adjust, which is one
equilibrium response, then real money falls. This argument depends, however,
on the idea that when there are several equilibrium
responses to a shock, the
one with fixed nominal prices, rather than the one with fixed real prices, is

prices in nominal terms, which (as we argue in note 10 above) amountsfixing

VI. THE LABOR MARKET AND REAL WAGE RIGIDITY

A. Discussion
For simplicity, the models of the previous sections suppress the labor
market and study the implications of real price rigidity arising from product
market imperfections.

Traditionally, however, macroeconomists have viewed

labor market imperfections as central to aggregate fluctuations. Motivated by

this view, we now present a model with a labor market in which rigidity in

firms' real prices is caused by rigidity in their real wages.

Real wage

rigidity arises from efficiency wage considerations.17

The results of previous sections provide two more specific motivations

for this section. First, the small degree of nominal rigidity in our basic
yeoman farmer model arises largely from inelastic labor supply, which gives
farmers strong incentives to stabilize their employment by adjusting prices.
The

analogue when firms hire workers in a Walrasian labor market is that in-

elastic

labor supply implies highly procyclical real wages -— large wage in-

creases are needed
hiily

price

to elicit more work. Highly procyclical real wages imply

procyclical marginal costs, which in turn imply strong incentives for
adjustment when demand changes.

A potential

advantage of efficiency

17Nominal rigidity still arises in prices but not wages because we do not
introduce nominal frictions in wage setting. If we added such frictions, real
wage rigidity would increase nominal wage rigidity just as real price rigidity
increases nominal price rigidity.

32

wage models is that firms set wages above the market clearing level. Since
real wages are not tied directly to labor supply, inelastic labor supply need

not imply procyclical real wáges.8

A second motivation for this section is the difficulty in earlier sections of determining how much real price rigidity is realistic.

This dif-

ficulty reflects uncertainty about the values of key parameters (the cost of
adjusting

tion,

real prices and

the

sharpness of the bend in demand). In this sec-

the degree of real price rigidity is determined by the degree of real

wage rigidity -—

the responsiveness of real wages to demand shifts. We know

something about this parameter; in particular, the acyclicality of real wages
in actual economies suggests that a

high degree of rigidity is realistic.

Our analysis of efficiency wages is tentative because research has not

yet

clearly established the implications of efficiency wages for the cyclical

behavior of real wages. In early efficiency wage models, in which workers'
effort depends only on their wages (such as Solow, 1979), wages are completely

acyclical. More recent tshirkingI models (such as Shapiro and Stiglitz, 1984)

imply procyclical real wages: when unemployment is high, workers are fearful

of being fired, and so firms can reduce wages without inducing shirking.
Blanchard (1987b) argues, however, that real wages are less procyclical when

181n emphasizing the labor market, we depart from currently popular macroeconomic theories that focus on the product market.
For example, Hall
(1986) argues that the combination of constant marginal cost and imperfect
competition leads to slow adjustment of the economy to shocks. These product
market theories are incomplete because they do not explain how their assumptions are consistent with labor market behavior —— for example, how marginal
cost can be acyclical despite inelastic labor supply.

33

firms pay efficiency wages than in a Walrasian labor market, and Sparks (1986)

presents a modification of the shirking model in which real wages are acyclical. These results appear plausible because, as noted above, efficiency wages

break the link between wages and labor supply that causes highly procyclical

real wages. But at present, the robustness of these results and the size of
the effect of efficiency wages on the cyclicality of real wages are unclear.

In what follows, we simply assume that real wages are substantially less
procyclical --

that

is, more rigid in the face of demand fluctuations -—

than

in a clearing market.19

B. A Model

We now present an example to illustrate the potential importance of ef-

ficiency wages.2° Since efficiency wages are a labor market phenomenon, a
preliminary step is to modify our basic model by assuming that farmers work
for each other rather than for themselves. For the moment, we assume that the

labor market is Walrasian. Farmers have two sources of income, profits from
their own farms and wages from working for others. Using the production function, (16), and the product demand equation, (19), one can derive the follow-

191n all efficiency wage models, real wages are rigid in the sense that they
are set above market-clearing levels. This is not, however, the relevant type

of real rigidity. As throughout the paper, large real effects of money require real rigidity in the sense of small responses to demand shifts.

20Akerlof and Yellen (1985) also present a model that combines a small

friction ("near—rationality") with efficiency wages. They do not,
however, ask how the real rigidity resulting from efficiency wages affects the
size of the real effects of money. They introduce efficiency wages so that
nominal

nominal shocks affect involuntary unemployment as well as employment and output.

The functional form of (43) is chosen for comparability with (41). We can interpret (43) as giving the wage needed to prevent workers from shirking. 8>1
implies that in the vicinity of the no—shock equilibrium, wages are set above

the market—clearing level, and so suppliers of labor are rationed.

(For

simplicity, we assume below that B is close to one). Since workers are off
their labor supply curves, the wage is no longer tied to 'f', which determines

the labor supply elasticity.

$cy means that wages respond less to demand

shifts than In a Walrasian labor market —"no

other words, as in Blanchard the

shirking condition" is flatter than the labor supply curve.

35

Following other efficiency wage models, we assume that part of the
rationing of hours of work occurs through unemployment. Specifically, we assume that the division of labor input into workers and hours is given by

(L1D)i—a ,

where Ej is the number of workers hired by farmer i, Hi is hours per worker,

and L0:EHj is the amount of labor the farmer hires. We assume that workers
are divided between employment and unemployment randomly.

(The division of

LiD into Ei and Hi proves irrelevant to the degree of nominal rigidity,
but relevant to the welfare loss from rigidity.)

In this model, w() is a farmer's expected utility given his probability
of employment. Since the size of the labor force is one, this probability is
equal to Ei (equation (244)). The farmer's utility is determined by (40) with

the wage given by (43) and the farmer's labor supply equal to Hj (equation

@5)) when employed and zero when unemployed.

36

Our assumption that real wages are more rigid under efficiency wages, $<y,
implies that real prices are also more rigid. In terms of our general model,

efficiency wages increase real price rigidity by lowering W12 while leaving
W22 unchanged. In this respect the current model differs from our earlier ex-

amples, in which real rigidity arises from a higher -W22.

Intuitively, ef-

ficiency wages do not affect W22 because they do not make changes in a firm's

real price more costly. Instead, they reduce the responses of firms' desired
prices

to demand shifts because they reduce the effects of demand on the

determinants of the desired price. Specifically, the desired price is proportional to marginal cost; since efficiency wages make

real

wages less respon-

sive to aggregate demand, they make marginal cost less responsive.
To see

the implications of efficiency wages for nominal rigidity, we cal-

culate x and R for the two models. We assume for simplicity that 8=1 (this
implies that the no—shock level of employment under efficiency wages is close
to the level in a Walrasian labor market). The results are

Efficiency

wages increase nominal rigidity (since 4rcy), and the

degree of nominal rigidity becomes large as the real wage becomes acyclical

37

(4, approaches one). The effect of efficiency wages on R is more complex, but
also becomes large as the real wage becomes acyclical.21

As in previous sections, we now ask how much real rigidity is needed for

large non-neutralities. For various parameter values, Table 3 shows the degree of real price rigidity, the private cost of non-adjustment to a five per-

cent change in money, and the value of R in both the Walrasian and the efficiency wage model. In contrast to our previous examples, the degree of real

price rigidity is determined by a parameter for which we know plausible
values, and so we can ask whether the amount of real rigidity needed for substantial nominal rigidity is realistic.

As an empirically plausible base case, we assume that 4:1.1 ——

21While REW is much larger than Rwal for plausible parameter values (see
below), RWal is larger for some parameter values. This ambiguity arises because moving

from the Walrasian to the efficiency wage model reduces -W11,
which implies smaller social costs of rigidity, as well as reducing W12. Intuitively, rigidity is less costly under efficiency wages because the result-

output fluctuations arise partly from fluctuations in employment; in the
Wairasian model, fluctuations arise entirely from changes in hours per worker.
Fluctuations in employment imply fluctuations in each individual's probability
of employment, which are costless on average because expected utility is
ing

linear in this probability.

Fluctuations in hours are costly because utility

is concave in hours.

22Estimates of the cyclical behavior of real wages vary, but many studies
find

that real wages are approximately acyclical (for example, Geary and Ken-

1982). The choice of a:1/2 is based on the common finding (for example,
Barsky and Miron, 1987) that at business cycle frequencies the elasticity of
output with respect to employment is roughly two and the elasticity with
respect to total manhours is roughly one.

above that the markup and labor supply elasticity are both .15.

For these

parameter values, the introduction of efficiency wages has dramatic effects.

In a Wairasian labor market, the private cost of rigidity is a huge 38% of
revenue, and R is a tiny .02.23 But with efficiency wages, the private cost
is less than one hundredth of a percent and H is 33. As in our other models,
substantial nominal rigidity requires substantial real price rigidity ——

in

our base case, introducing efficiency wages reduces u from 6.7 to .1. But in
this model, it is clear that this much real rigidity can arise from plausible

underlying assumptions ——

in

particular, the assumption that real wages

respond little to aggregate demand.

There are two caveats concerning these results. First, the value of R is
quite sensitive to moderate changes in parameter values -—

Second, and most impor—

23Note that nominal prices are much more flexible with a Walrasian labor
market than in the self—employment model of Section III -— the private cost of
rigidity is much larger and H is much smaller. These results reflect the
greater flexibility of real prices in the Walrasian model: for our base case,

Intuitively,
the private gains from price adjustment are large with a Walrasian labor
market because when output falls (for example) the real wage is low. Since a
producer can hire as much labor as he wants at this wage, he can greatly in-

crease profits by cutting his price and increasing output.

Finally,
note that E:.02 implies that, with a Walrasian labor market, the private gains
from adjustment are much greater than the social gains. While an individual
producer can greatly increase profits by cutting his price when the real wage
is low, society cannot realize similar gains: if all sellers cut their prices,
then output rises and the real wage rises, which greatly reduces each seller's
gain from adjustment.

model. This reflects the fact that research has not completely determined how
efficiency wages affect the cyclicality of real wages, and highlights the im-

portance of future work on this issue. Our results simply show that if efficiency wages greatly reduce the responsiveness of real wages to demand, then

they explain large nominal rigidities.
VII.

CONCLUSIONS

Rigidities in real wages and prices are not sufficient to explain real
effects of nominal disturbances. In the absence of nominal frictions, prices

adjust fully to nominal shocks regardless of the degree of real rigidity.
Small costs of adjusting nominal prices are also not enough to explain important non—neutralities.

With no real rigidities, these frictions cannot

prevent adjustment to sizable nominal

have

shocks or cause nominal fluctuations to

large welfare effects. This paper shows, however, that the combination

of substantial real rigidity and small costs of nominal flexibility can lead
to large real effects of money.

To review the explanation for this result, non—adjustment of prices to a
nominal disturbance is an equilibrium when no price setter wants to adjust his

price if others do not adjust.

But non—adjustment to a nominal shock when

40

others' prices are fixed implies non—adjustment of a real price to a change in

real demand. Real rigidity means

that a

price setter desires only a small

price change when demand shifts. In the absence of nominal frictions, a small
desired change implies that

non—adjustment is not an equilibrium. But since

the cost of forgoing a small adjustment is small, a small "menu cost" is sufficient to make rigidity an equilibrium.24

We demonstrate the connection between real and nominal rigidity in a
general class of models of imperfectly competitive price setters.

In ad-

dition, we present models in which real rigidities arise from three specific

sources: an ad hoc cost of changing real prices, imperfect information and
customer markets, and efficiency wages. For each model, we find that a large

degree of nominal rigidity arises only if the degree of real rigidity is
large. We do not fully resolve whether the necessary amount of real rigidity
is realistic. This requires development of models of real rigidities in which

the degree of rigidity is derived from microeconomic parameters for which we
know plausible values.

Strengthening the foundations of Keynesian economics requires further
research into real rigidities. The point of this paper is that, along with
small nominal frictions, real rigidities can lead to large nominal rigidities.

Thus as we develop better explanations for real rigidities, we gain better ex-

24Thus, for example, Keynes's argument that workers' concern for relative
wages can lead to nominal wage rigidity is correct if amended slightly. Concern for relative wages is likely to reduce but not completely eliminate a
firm's desired adjustment to a nominal shock. Keynes is correct if there is a
small cost to prevent firms from making small adjustments.
