ABSTRACT
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly food stamps) is one of the
most important elements of the social safety net. Unlike most other safety net programs, SNAP
varies little across states and over time, which creates challenges for quasi-experimental
evaluation. Notably, SNAP benefits are fixed across 48 states; but local food prices vary, leading
to geographic variation in the real value – or purchasing power – of SNAP benefits. In this study,
we provide the first estimates that leverage variation in SNAP purchasing power across markets
to examine effects of SNAP on child health. We link panel data on regional food prices to
National Health Interview Survey data and use a fixed effects framework to estimate the
relationship between local purchasing power of SNAP and children’s health and health care
utilization. We find that lower SNAP purchasing power leads to lower utilization of preventive
health care and more days of school missed due to illness. We find no effect on reported health
status.

Introduction
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly the Food Stamp program)

is the largest food assistance program and one of the largest safety net programs in the United
States.1 SNAP plays a crucial role in reducing poverty for children in the U.S., with only the EITC
(combined with the Child Tax Credit) raising more children above poverty (Fox 2017). Eligibility
for the program is universal in that it depends only on a family’s income and assets; in 2015, 1
in 7 Americans received SNAP benefits (Ziliak 2015).
SNAP’s primary goals are to improve food security among low-income households, reduce
hunger, and increase access to a healthful diet.2 The extant literature demonstrates that the
program succeeds in reducing food insecurity among recipient households (see, e.g., Yen et al.
2008; Nord and Golla 2009; Mykerezi and Mills 2010; Ratcliffe, McKernan, and Zhang 2011;
Shaefer and Gutierrez 2011; Schmidt, Shore-Sheppard, and Watson 2016 and the recent review
by Hoynes and Schanzenbach 2016). Nonetheless, rates of food insecurity among SNAP
households remain quite high, raising the question of whether SNAP benefits are adequate to
meet the nutritional needs of recipients (Coleman-Jensen et al. 2012). Indeed, evidence
regarding how SNAP benefits impact recipients’ nutrition is more mixed (see, e.g., Yen 2010;
Gregory et al. 2013; Bronchetti, Christensen, and Hansen 2017b).
Our study provides unique and highly policy-relevant evidence on the impact of variation in

1 SNAP benefits paid in 2016 amounted to more than 66 billion dollars. The program has also grown dramatically in the years

since 1996 welfare reform, with benefits paid out almost tripling in real terms over the years in this study (1999-2010).

the generosity of SNAP benefit levels on child health. Estimating the causal relationship
between SNAP and health is difficult because SNAP benefits and eligibility rules are legislated at
the federal level and do not vary across states, leaving few opportunities for quasi-experimental
analysis. One set of quasi-experimental studies analyzes the rollout of the food stamp program
across counties in the 1960s and 1970s and finds that food stamps leads to significant
improvements in birth outcomes (Currie and Moretti 2008; Almond, Hoynes, and Schanzenbach
2011) and access to food stamps in early childhood leads to significant improvements in adult
health (Hoynes, Schanzenbach, and Almond 2016). A second set of studies uses recent state
changes in application procedures (e.g. allowing online applications, whether there is a finger
printing requirement) as instruments for SNAP participation (Schmeiser 2012),3 though these
state policies had relatively small effects on participation (Ziliak 2015). A third approach is taken
by East (2016), who uses variation in eligibility for SNAP generated by welfare reform legislation
in the 1990s, and finds that SNAP in early childhood leads to improvements in health status at
ages 6-16. None of these studies, however, is able to shed light on how changes to legislated
SNAP benefit levels might impact health outcomes.
Our approach leverages plausibly exogenous geographic variation in the real value of SNAP
benefits to identify the effects of variation in SNAP generosity on health for a sample of children
in SNAP households. Importantly, the SNAP benefit formula is fixed across 48 states (benefits
are higher in Alaska and Hawaii) even though the price of food varies significantly across the

have fewer sick days and fewer doctor’s visits, but more checkup visits.

country (Todd et al. 2010; Todd, Leibtag, and Penberthy 2011).4 Across the continental U.S.,
maximum benefits vary only with family size; in 2018 a family of three is eligible for a maximum
benefit of $504/month regardless of the local cost of living. Though SNAP benefits are implicitly
adjusted for variation in the cost of living through allowed deductions (e.g., for housing, and
child care) in the calculation of net income, the limited available evidence indicates these
adjustments are not sufficient to equalize real benefits, particularly in high cost areas (Breen et
al. 2011). Gundersen, Kreider, and Pepper (2011) and the Institute of Medicine (2013) propose
this as an area for future research.
Higher SNAP purchasing power may impact children’s health through three possible
channels. A direct (nutrition) effect occurs if higher SNAP purchasing power leads to increases
in the quality or quantity of food. But higher SNAP purchasing power may also impact health
indirectly, facilitating households to increase consumption of other inputs into the health
production function, like health care. Finally, if additional SNAP purchasing power leads to
reductions in stress and “bandwidth poverty” (Bertrand et al 2004, Mullainathan and Shafir
2013), it may result in better compliance with activities such as getting children to school and to
the doctor for annual exams.
Linking nationally representative data from the 1999-2010 National Health Interview
Surveys (NHIS) to information on regional food prices from the Quarterly Food-at-home Price
Database (QFAHPD), we study the effect of variation in SNAP purchasing power on children’s
health care utilization and health. Our measure of SNAP purchasing power compares the

4 Studying data from the Quarterly Food at Home Price Database (QFAHPD), Todd et al. (2011) find that regional food prices

vary from 70 to 90 percent of the national average at the low end to 120 to 140 percent at the high end.

maximum SNAP benefit to the regional cost of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP), a nutrition plan
constructed by the USDA to represent a nutritious diet at minimal cost and the basis for
maximum legislated SNAP benefits (i.e., maximum benefits are set to the TFP national average
cost). The QFAHPD includes information on food prices that allows us to construct an estimated
TFP price for each of 30 designated “market group” geographic areas across the U.S. We relate
child health care utilization and health outcomes to SNAP purchasing power (i.e., the ratio of
the national SNAP maximum benefit to the market group-level TFP price faced by a household)
in a fixed effects framework that controls for a number of individual-level and region
characteristics (including non-food prices in the area) and state policy variables. Identification
comes from differences across the 30 market groups in trends in the price of the TFP.
Our study contributes to the growing body of evidence on the SNAP program and its effects
in a few key ways. First, we provide new evidence on the relationship between SNAP benefit
generosity and the health and wellbeing of the SNAP population. Our findings consistently
indicate that children in market groups with lower purchasing power of SNAP utilize less
preventive/ambulatory health care. We find that a 10 percent increase in SNAP purchasing
power raises the likelihood a child has an annual checkup by 6.3 percentage points (8.1
percent) and the likelihood of any doctor’s visit by 3.1 percentage points (3.4 percent). While
lower real SNAP benefits do not result in significant declines in reported health status, we
document significant detrimental impacts on some health indicators, like the number of school
days missed due to illness, as well as on children’s food security. Summary indices corroborate
the existence of effects on health care utilization, but not health outcomes generally. We
confirm that these effects are not driven by relationships between geographic variation in food

4

prices and SNAP participation or health insurance coverage, nor are they present in placebo
samples of somewhat higher-income children and noncitizen children (who are ineligible for
SNAP).
A second contribution is methodological, in that our approach highlights a new
identification strategy for estimating effects of proposed changes in SNAP generosity on other
outcomes of interest. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to utilize variation in the real
value of SNAP as a source of identification.5 Future research could leverage geographic
variation in SNAP purchasing to examine SNAP’s impacts on nutrition, food consumption and
other spending patterns, birth outcomes, and adult health.6
We interpret our estimates as reflecting the impacts of variation in SNAP purchasing power,
rather than simply the effects of variation in local food prices.7 Variation in real SNAP
generosity may affect households differently than variation in prices to the extent that local
earnings adjust to account for higher local prices (Roback 1982; Albouy 2008; Moretti 2013),
while SNAP benefits do not. Indeed, we demonstrate that SNAP purchasing power does not
significantly impact our key health outcomes or food insecurity for samples that are ineligible
for SNAP or have very low SNAP utilization (e.g., non-citizen children, children in families with
incomes between 300 and 450 percent of the poverty line). Additionally, while our main models
include controls for regional prices of other goods (such as housing, energy, transportation,

5

In related work, Gregory and Coleman-Jensen (2013) study the direct relationship between local food prices and food
insecurity for a sample of SNAP households. The authors find that SNAP participants in high-priced areas are 15-20 percent
more likely to be food insecure than those in low-priced areas.
6 Bronchetti, Christensen, and Hansen (2017b) link National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS) data
on SNAP recipients’ diets to local data on the cost of the TFP to study the effects of variation in SNAP purchasing power on
nutrition among the SNAP population.
7 Throughout, our models include market area fixed effects and controls for local housing costs (HUD fair market rent) and
other non-food prices.

etc.), our results are robust to the inclusion of these factors, suggesting that we are not simply
capturing the broader effects of living in a more or less expensive market.
More broadly, our findings point to sizeable, beneficial impacts of SNAP (and of increasing
the generosity of SNAP benefits) for children’s health care utilization, food security, and some
measures of their health, benefits which should be weighed carefully against the cost savings of
any proposed cuts to the SNAP program. These results also shed light on the expected impact
of adjusting benefit levels to account for geographic variation in food prices across market
groups. Such adjustments would likely reduce disparities in preventive/ambulatory care, school
absenteeism, and food security among low-income children, but may not lead to
contemporaneous changes in other health outcomes.
The paper proceeds as follows. The next section describes our multiple sources of data on
regional food prices, child health, food security, and SNAP participation, and Section 3 lays out
our empirical approach. Section 4 presents our main results regarding the impact of SNAP
purchasing power on children’s health care utilization and health, Section 5 explores
mechanisms and several robustness checks, and Section 6 concludes.

Data
In this study, we combine three sets of data to estimate the effect of SNAP on children’s

health. Below we describe the data on the price of the TFP, the National Health Interview
Survey, and the state and county control variables. Additionally, we supplement our main
analysis with administrative data on SNAP caseloads and household-level data on food
insecurity from the December Current Population Survey (CPS).

2.1 Regional Cost of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP)
The Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) is a food plan constructed by the USDA, specifying foods and
amounts that represent a nutritious diet at a minimal cost. The TFP is used as the basis for
legislated maximum SNAP benefit levels. In 2016, the U.S. average weekly TFP cost was $146.90
for a family of four with two adults and two children (ages 6-8 and 9-11).8
To assign food prices to our sample of households in the NHIS, we construct data on the
regional price of the TFP using the Quarterly Food-at-Home Price Database (QFAHPD) (Todd et
al. 2010) for the years from 1999 through 2010. The QFAHPD, created by the USDA’s Economic
Research Service, uses Nielsen scanner data to compute quarterly estimates of the price of 52
food categories (e.g. three categories of fruit: fresh or frozen fruit, canned fruit, fruit juices;
nine categories of vegetables, etc.) for 35 regional market groups. The 35 market groups
covered in the QFAHPD include 26 metropolitan areas and 9 nonmetropolitan areas, though for
1999-2001 only 4 nonmetropolitan areas are captured.9 Each market group consists of a
combination of counties. We map the 52 QFAHPD food categories to the 29 TFP food categories
to create a single price estimate for the TFP for each market group and year during the full
1999-2010 period covered by the QFAHPD, following the methods in Gregory and Coleman-

8 See https://www.cnpp.usda.gov/sites/default/files/CostofFoodNov2016.pdf. (Accessed 1/28/17)
9 In 1999-2001, the QFAHPD identified one nonmetropolitan area for each of the 4 census regions (east, central, south and

west). In 2002 and later, they expanded to include nonmetropolitan areas in each of the 9 census divisions: New England,
Middle Atlantic, East North Central, West North Central, South Atlantic, East South Central, West South Central, Mountain and
Pacific. For comparability we use the four nonmetropolitan areas throughout. Appendix figure 1 shows these market groups.

Jensen (2013).10, 11
To map the QFAHPD food group prices to the TFP food group prices in the market basket,
we use an expenditure-weighted average of the prices for the QFAHPD foods, where the
weights are the expenditure shares for the QFAHPD foods within each TFP category (most TFP
food categories consist of multiple QFAHPD food groups). We construct national expenditure
shares by averaging the shares across all market groups. To avoid confounding regional
variation in food prices with regional variation in consumption of different food categories, we
apply these national expenditure shares to each market group’s prices when constructing the
market group-level cost of the TFP.12, 13 We use the 2006 specification of the TFP, which
features food categories that are relatively closely aligned with the food categories in the
QFAHPD data (Carlson et al. 2007).
We assign each household in the NHIS to a market group-level TFP price based on the
county of residence and the year of interview. When estimating the relationship between the

10 We come very close to reproducing their estimates. As in this earlier work, we can cleanly link the QFAHPD categories to 23

of the 29 TFP categories without duplication or overlap of QFAHPD prices. The remaining six TFP categories contain foods that
are accounted for in other parts of the QFAHPD TFP basket. For details on the construction of the TFP itself, see Carlson et al.
(2007).
11 There are two versions of the QFAHPD: QFAHPD-1, which provides price data on 52 food groups for 1999-2006, and

QFAHPD-2, which includes prices for 54 food groups for 2004-2010. We bridge the two series by estimating the average ratio of
QFAHPD-1 to QFAHPD-2 for years 2004 through 2006 for each market group. We then divide the price data for 1999-2003 (i.e.
the years with information on only 52 food groups) by this ratio to put everything in consistent units.
12 We have also constructed measures of TFP cost using total national expenditure shares (as opposed to averaging the weights

across market groups) and obtain very similar estimates of the TFP and effect sizes.
13 An example (borrowed from Gregory and Coleman-Jensen (2013)) is illustrative. The TFP food category “whole fruit”

consists of two QFAHPD food groups: “fresh/frozen fruit” and “canned fruit.” In Hartford (market group 1) in the first quarter of
2002, expenditures on fresh/frozen fruit were $35.7 million, and expenditures on canned fruit were $5.8 million. This yields
expenditure weights for whole fruit (in Hartford in quarter 1 2002) of 0.86 and 0.13, respectively. We then average these
expenditure shares across all market groups to generate the national expenditure shares (for each item and period). In 2002,
these national expenditure weights are 0.84 and 0.16 for fresh fruit and canned fruit, respectively. We apply these shares to the
first-quarter 2002 prices of fresh/frozen and canned fruit in the Hartford market group ($0.218 and $0.244 per 100 grams,
respectively) to compute a price for whole fruit in Hartford for the first quarter of 2002 (0.84×$0.218+0.16×$0.244 = $0.222 per
100 grams).

real value of SNAP benefits and health, we measure the purchasing power of SNAP using the
ratio of the maximum SNAP benefit to the TFP price faced by the household. Our main
regression models use the natural log of this ratio as the key independent variable for ease of
interpretation; however, results are qualitatively very similar when the level of the ratio is
employed instead.14
Figure 1 illustrates the variation across regions and over time in the real value of SNAP,
equal to the maximum SNAP benefit for a family of 4 divided by the regional cost of the TFP.15
Panel A displays the value of this ratio in 1999, Panel B shows its value in 2008, and Panel C
shows its value in 2010. In each case, a darker shading represents a higher SNAP/TFP ratio, or
greater SNAP purchasing power. In lower-cost areas the SNAP benefit covers up to 80 percent
of the cost of the TFP, while in higher cost areas (e.g., the west and northeast) this ratio falls to
less than 65 percent. Note that since the statutory TFP is constructed using a national average,
some areas are, by definition, likely to have SNAP benefits that exceed the cost of the TFP.
However, our purchasing power measure (maximum SNAP benefit/price of TFP) is less than 1
for all market groups. One reason for this is that the regional TFP prices from the QFAHPD are
based on average prices paid for each food category by all consumers, whereas the statutory
TFP price is based on prices paid by low-income persons. If low-income households are
shopping at different stores, or buying on sale or buying cheaper (e.g., store) brands, then the
TFP price we estimate using the QFAHPD will consistently be too high.
Our identification strategy relies not on the exact level of the TFP price (or SNAP purchasing

power), but on the relative generosity across markets and differences across markets in trends
in SNAP purchasing power. Figure 2 demonstrates a strong, positive correlation between the
market area price paid by low-income households and the market area all-household price, for
a variety of food categories. In Appendix Figure 2, we compare our estimated TFP price to a
lowest-cost TFP price measure, by market area, which we construct using only the lowest-cost
QFAHPD food category within each TFP category (similar to how the statutory TFP price is
calculated). Reassuringly, we find a strong correlation (0.98) between our index and this
lowest-cost alternate measure across market areas.
Figure 1 also demonstrates noticeable changes in SNAP purchasing power within regions
over the 1999 – 2010 period. The changes in 2010 reflect, in part, the effect of the stimulus
package (ARRA), which raised the maximum SNAP benefit in the second half of 2009 and
throughout 2010. Appendix Figures 3a and 3b present trends in the TFP price and SNAP
purchasing power, respectively, for each of the market group areas. Trends in food prices and
SNAP purchasing power vary significantly across areas, with SNAP purchasing power rising
sharply in all areas with the ARRA.
Given that food stamp recipients are not limited to purchasing the TFP basket, why do we
use it? Ultimately, we are looking for a standardized index across places and over time that
allows us to trace out variation in food prices that are relevant for the low-income population.
Our investigations (Figure 2, Appendix Figure 2) indicate that the different price series are very
highly correlated across place. In the end, we view the TFP as appealing because it is the index
used by USDA in setting benefits. Furthermore, by using the price of a set basket we remove
the influence of any (endogenous) changes in food choices that recipients make in the face of

10

higher prices.

2.2

National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Data on SNAP Children
We use restricted-access micro data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) for

the years 1999-2010 to examine effects on child health and health care utilization.16 The NHIS
surveys approximately 35,000 households per year. By gaining restricted-use access to this data
we can observe the county of residence for each household in the survey. This allows us to link
respondents to regional area food prices and access detailed information on children’s health
and the characteristics of their parents and households for a large and representative national
sample. From each household with children, the survey selects one child at random (the
“sample child”) and collects more extensive and detailed information on this child’s health and
health care utilization. Several of the outcomes we study are only available in these Sample
Child files, while others (e.g., parent-reported health status) are available for all NHIS
respondents in the Person-level file.
Our primary sample includes children ages 17 and under who are citizens of the United
States. We impose the citizenship restriction because the post-welfare reform era witnessed
dramatic changes to rules regarding non-citizens’ eligibility for many social safety net programs,
including SNAP. (We analyze noncitizen children as a placebo group below.) We conduct our
main analyses on the sample of children in households who report having received SNAP
benefits in at least one of the past 12 months. For the years from 1999 through 2010, there are

16 State and county identifiers are masked in the public use NHIS data. Researchers interested in accessing the restricted

geocode data should contact Peter Meyer at rdca@cdc.gov.

11

44,627 such children; 18,299 of them are also interviewed as Sample Children. While the
advantage of limiting our analysis to the SNAP recipients is clear (this is the group most affected
by SNAP), non-random selection into SNAP participation would call into question a causal
interpretation of our estimates. In Section 4.1, we analyze the impact of SNAP purchasing
power on SNAP participation at the county level and document no significant relationship
between the real value of SNAP benefits and the per-capita SNAP caseload. As a robustness
check in Section 5, we also test the sensitivity of our results using an alternative sample with a
high likelihood of being on SNAP—children living with low-educated, unmarried parent(s).
Families with limited resources may respond to lower SNAP purchasing power by reducing
consumption of other goods that impact health, like ambulatory or preventive health care.
Additionally, lower SNAP purchasing power could lead to increases in stress and bandwidth
poverty, resulting in lower compliance with preventive care. Our primary measures of health
care utilization are indicators for whether the child has had a check-up in the past 12 months
and whether the child has had any doctor’s visit in the past 12 months. According to guidelines
from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), children should have 6-7 preventive visits
before age 1, 3 visits per year as 1-year olds, 2 visits as 2-year olds, and at least one visit per
year for ages 3 through 17. We also analyze the relationship between SNAP purchasing power
and whether (the parent reports that) a child has delayed or forgone care due to cost in the
past 12 months. Finally, we study whether the child has visited the ER in the past year; if lower
SNAP purchasing power reduces the use of preventive/ambulatory care, we might also see
increased utilization of ER care.
We also analyze the effects of SNAP purchasing power on several direct measures of child

12

health that might respond to reduced nutrition, or to reduced consumption of other inputs in
the health production function (e.g., health care). Parental respondents report the child’s
health status on a 5-point scale (excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor); we use this
measure to construct an indicator for whether the child is in excellent or very good health. As
measures of contemporaneous health, we also study whether the child was hospitalized over
the past 12 months, the number of school days missed due to illness in the past 12 months (for
the sub-sample of school aged children), and an indicator for whether the child missed 5 or
more days of school due to illness. School attendance might also respond due to the stress and
bandwidth poverty channel. In addition, we estimate the relationship between SNAP
purchasing power and two longer-term health outcomes that may be affected by reduced
nutrition or to food insecurity: an indicator for obesity based on height and weight data (for the
subsample of children ages 12-17), and whether the child has emotional problems (defined for
the universe of children ages 4 and older).
In addition, we test both of these groups of outcomes (preventive health care utilization,
health outcomes) using summary index methods as in Kling, Liebman, and Katz (2007).17
Table 1 displays summary statistics for SNAP recipient children and for the entire population
of children. As expected, SNAP children are likely to be poor, live in single-parent households
(only a third live with both parents), and are disproportionately likely to be black or Hispanic.
Because such a high fraction (72 percent) of SNAP children receive Medicaid, the rate of

17

We create summary indices by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of each variable, then averaging
across variables within items in the index. Typically, the mean and standard deviation of a control group are used, but lacking
that, we use the full sample. Note that the sample in these regressions is limited to those with full data from all included
measures. For the health outcomes index this implies school age children only. Anderson (2008) explains similar indices clearly,
and Hoynes, Schanzenbach, and Almond (2016) use the technique when evaluating long-run impacts of SNAP.

13

uninsurance among this sample is low, at about 7 percent. Health care utilization and health
outcomes are somewhat similar for SNAP citizen children compared to the general population
of children in the U.S. Nearly one-quarter of SNAP children went without a check-up in the past
year, but 90 percent had at least some sort of doctor’s visit during that time, and more than 5
percent report having delayed or gone without care due to its cost. However, ER utilization is
high, at over 30 percent, compared to 21 percent among the entire population. In terms of
health itself, SNAP children have similar health status, but miss more school days (5, on
average, but one-third of SNAP children missed 5 or more in the past year), and more
commonly have emotional problems (46 percent of SNAP children 4 or older compared to 27
percent in the general population).

2.3 State and County Control Variables
We include several variables to control for regional policies and prices that might affect
child health and be correlated with local food prices. First, we control for local labor market
conditions with the county unemployment rate. Second, we include a summary index of statelevel SNAP policies developed by (Ganong and Liebman, Forthcoming), which incorporates
measures for simplified reporting, recertification lengths, interview format (e.g. in person or
not), call centers, online applications, Supplemental Security Income Combined Application
Project, vehicle exemptions for asset requirement, and broad-based categorical eligibility.
Third, we control for other state policies including the minimum wage, state EITC, TANF
maximum benefit guarantee amounts, and Medicaid/State Children’s Health Insurance Program
(CHIP) income eligibility limits. Finally, we control for prices of other goods by including HUD’s

14

fair market rent (measured by county as the “40th percentile of gross rents for typical, nonsubstandard rental units occupied by recent movers in a local housing market”18) and regional
Consumer Price Indices (CPIs) for non-food, non-housing categories (apparel, commodities,
education, medical, recreation, services, transportation and other goods and services). These
are available for 26 metro areas; for the remaining areas, the CPI is calculated within each of
the four census regions and for four county population sizes (<50,000, 50,000-1.5 million, >1.5
million).

2.4 Supplemental Data on SNAP Caseloads and Food Insecurity
We investigate the relationship between SNAP purchasing power and SNAP participation in
Section 4.1, using administrative data on county-level SNAP caseloads from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA), for the years from 1999 through 2010. We match each
county-year observation to that year’s TFP price for the market group to which the county
belongs.
To further probe mechanisms whereby variation in regional food prices may impact child
health, we supplement our main analysis by studying the relationship between SNAP
purchasing power and food insecurity.19 For this analysis we use data from the December
Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement (CPS-FSS) for the years from 2001-2010.20

18 More specifically, HUD estimates FMRs for 530 metropolitan areas and 2,045 nonmetropolitan county FMR areas.
19 Food insecurity is a household-level measure of well-being, defined as being unable to obtain, or uncertain of obtaining, an

adequate quantity and quality of food due to money or resources. Very-low food insecurity is defined as food insecurity that
includes disrupted or restricted dietary patterns. Prior to 2006, very-low food insecurity was labeled “food insecurity with
hunger”.
20 The December food security supplement was not collected in 1999 and 2000.

We identify a sample of 37,277 citizen children, ages 0 to 17, who live in households that report
receiving SNAP, and link them to market group TFP prices according to location of residence.21

Empirical Methods
We estimate the causal impact of variation in the real value of SNAP benefits on measures

of child health and health care utilization for children in households who report receiving SNAP
benefits during the past 12 months. Throughout, our regressions take the following form:
(1)

𝑆𝑁𝐴𝑃𝑀𝐴𝑋𝑡

𝑦𝑖𝑟𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽 ln (

𝑇𝐹𝑃𝑟𝑡

) + 𝑋𝑖𝑟𝑡 𝜃 + 𝑍𝑟𝑡 𝛾 + 𝛿𝑡 + 𝜆𝑟 + 𝜀𝑖𝑟𝑡

where 𝑦𝑖𝑟𝑡 is the health outcome of individual i who resides in region r (market group) in time t.
The key independent variable is the natural log of the ratio of maximum SNAP benefits for a
family of four (which vary by year, but is constant across regions) to the TFP price in region r in
year t. The vector Xirt contains a set of controls for the child’s characteristics, including his/her
age (and its square), race, Hispanic ethnicity, family size, indicators for the presence of the
mother (and/or father) in the household, and interactions between indicators for the mother's
(father's) presence and the mother's (father's) education, marital status, age, and citizenship.
The state policy variables described in Section 2.3 are included in Zrt, as are a set of regional
CPIs in non-food, non-housing consumption categories. All models also include a full set of fixed

21 The public-use food security supplement files reports geographic information on all states, 217 counties, 69 primary

metropolitan statistical areas, 173 metropolitan statistical areas (MSA), 40 combined statistical areas (CSA), and 278 core-based
statistical areas (CBSA) during our period of analysis. In order to assign CPS observations to a market group, we first identify
states that include a single market group and assign all observations in that state to the corresponding market group.
Continuing with the next most general geography (CSA), we repeat this process at increasingly more detailed geographies levels
to the county identifiers. After this step, we then assign observations living in a non-metropolitan area to the rural market
group based on their state of residence (for states with rural areas in a single market group). We match 83.7 percent of CPS
observations to a market group using this iterative process.

16

effects for the year (δt) and market group (r).22 In all models, the standard errors are corrected
for clustering at the market group level.
One important question is how much variation in the cost of food remains after controlling
for the prices of other goods. Appendix Table 3 shows an R2 of 0.82 when regressing our main
food price measure on other prices indexes, and R2 of 0.97 after adding fixed effects. Appendix
Figure 4 plots the residuals, which exhibit a fair amount of idiosyncratic variation. What causes
these residuals (and leads to our plausibly exogenous variation) is by definition difficult to
explain but could be related to local wages and demand conditions, which grocery/outlet chains
are in a market, or local supply shocks.23
Identification in this model comes from variation in trends in the price of the Thrifty Food
Plan across market groups. As we discussed in Section 2.1 (see Figure 1), there is substantial
variation across geographic areas in the purchasing power of SNAP benefits. More importantly
for our identification strategy, these regional differences change over time, with some areas
experiencing larger increases in SNAP purchasing power from 1999 to 2010, and others
experiencing smaller increases (e.g., purchasing power in some southern metropolitan areas
increased nearly 17 percent, but only about 4.5 percent in urban New York).24

22

We have also tested models with additional controls including income, parent-reported health status, and an
indicator for insurance coverage, but due to endogeneity concerns, we do not include these in our main
specification. The results are generally similar, however; see Appendix Tables 1 and 2.
23 It is similarly difficult to fully explain regional prices for other commodities such as gasoline in California. See for
example Borenstein, Bushnell, and Lewis (2004) and Borenstein (2015).
24 SNAP benefits in 2010 and 6 months of 2009 include increased benefits provided through the American Recovery and

Reinvestment Act (ARRA). ARRA benefits amounted to $62, or about a 13.6 percent increase above the base 2009 levels.
Changes in SNAP purchasing power ranged from a decrease of 5.8 percent in San Francisco to 4.3 percent increase in
metropolitan areas in Arkansas and Oklahoma over the 1999-2008 period.

Results

4.1 SNAP Participation
We begin by analyzing the effects of SNAP purchasing power on the SNAP caseload. If
variation in the real value of SNAP leads to changes in SNAP participation, then selection may
bias our estimates of the effect of SNAP purchasing power on child health.
Using data from USDA, we construct a county panel for annual SNAP caseloads covering
1999-2010. We estimate equation (1) where the dependent variable is SNAP caseloads divided
by county population. Table 2 displays the results of six different specifications of the model.
Each includes year and market group fixed effects, as well as the natural log of the ratio of
maximum SNAP benefits to the market group TFP price. In the second column we add a control
for the county unemployment rate, which is a significant determinant of SNAP caseloads (Bitler
and Hoynes 2016) and possibly correlated with regional prices. In column 3 we add controls for
state policy variables, including for SNAP, EITC, minimum wages, TANF generosity, and
Medicaid. In column 4 we add controls for regional prices, including the county HUD fair market
rent and regional CPIs for goods other than food.
When only year and market group fixed effects are included, the estimated coefficient on
SNAP purchasing power is positive and significant, consistent with the SNAP caseload per capita
rising when the purchasing power of SNAP increases. However, once we add county
unemployment rate, in column (2), the coefficient drops substantially in magnitude and is no
longer statistically different from zero. The addition of the state policy controls (column 3) and
the regional prices (column 4) does not change the coefficient significantly. In column 5, we
extend the specification by including a market group linear time trend, which leads to little

18

change in the estimated coefficient on SNAP purchasing power. From this we conclude that
there is no significant relationship between the real value of SNAP and SNAP caseloads, and
thus we interpret our main results free of concerns about selection.

4.2 SNAP Purchasing Power and Health Care Utilization
The primary goal of our study is to analyze the impacts of variation in the purchasing power
of SNAP benefits on outcomes related to child health. We begin by examining evidence for
measures of health care utilization, recognizing that families facing higher food prices may
respond to the lower real value of their SNAP benefits by reducing out-of-pocket spending on
other goods, including health care.
We present the results of this analysis in Table 3. Our primary measure of health care
utilization is an indicator for whether the child has had a check-up in the past 12 months
(column 1), which is observed only for children in the Sample Child file. We also examine
indicators for whether the child has had any doctor’s visit in the past 12 months (column 2),
and whether a child has visited an ER in the past 12 months (column 3). Whether a child has
delayed or forgone care is reported in the Person file of the NHIS so is observed for all NHIS
children under age 18; we report this estimate in column 4. The model includes fixed effects for
market group, year, individual controls, and regional controls for unemployment rate, non-food
prices, and state safety net policies (similar to column 4 of Table 2).25 The key independent
variable, representing SNAP purchasing power, is ln(SNAPMAX/TFP).
Among SNAP-recipient children, we find that increased purchasing power of SNAP

25 Individual-level controls include the child's age (and its square), whether the child is black or Hispanic, the child's family size,

indicators for the presence of the mother (and/or father) in the household, and interactions between indicators for the
mother's (father's) presence and the mother's (father's) education, marital status, age, and citizenship.

19

significantly raises the likelihood a child has had a checkup in the past 12 months. A ten
percent increase in the ratio (SNAPMAX/TFP) leads to a 6.3 percentage point (or 8.1 percent)
increase in the likelihood of a checkup. We also document a smaller, but significant impact of
increased SNAP purchasing power on the probability a child has had any doctor’s visit over the
past 12 months. A ten percent increase in the purchasing power of SNAP raises the likelihood
of any doctor’s visit by 3.1 percentage points, or 3.4 percent.
The results in columns 3 and 4 indicate that SNAP purchasing power has no statistically
significant effect on whether children have visited the ER in the past 12 months, or are reported
to have delayed or forgone care due to cost. However, the coefficients are negative, suggesting
a protective effect of SNAP.

4.3 SNAP Purchasing Power and Health Outcomes
Table 4 presents evidence on the extent to which variation in SNAP purchasing power
affects child health outcomes. The regression specifications include the same set of controls as
in Table 3. Note that several of the outcomes are defined only for sub-samples of children,
leading to different numbers of observations across the columns of Table 4. Specifically,
obesity is measured only for children ages 12 through 17,26 emotional problems are identified
for children ages 4 and older, and the number of school days missed is recorded only for
children age 5 and older who are in school. Parent-reported health status and hospitalization in
the past 12 months are reported for all children, but the other health outcomes are only

26 The indicator for obesity is based on BMI calculations, which are affected by some outlying height and weight

measurements. We trim the top and bottom of the BMI distribution to exclude the top and bottom percentile. In addition,
height and weight information was only collected for children ages 12 and older in years 2008 through 2010. We therefore limit
the sample to children ages 12-17.

20

provided for children in the Sample Child file.
We find no statistically significant relationship between SNAP purchasing power on the
indicator for the child’s (parent-reported) health status being excellent or very good, nor the
likelihood of having been hospitalized in the past year. However, we document a strong
negative and robust relationship between the real value of SNAP and the number of school
days children missed due to illness. For SNAP recipient children, a ten percent increase in SNAP
purchasing power is associated with a decrease in missed school days of just over 1 day (or a 22
percent decrease relative to the mean of approximately 5 days missed).
The evidence in Table 4 indicates that SNAP purchasing power does not significantly impact
obesity or the propensity to have emotional problems, although we note that these are longer
term health problems that often develop over time and may be less likely to respond
contemporaneously to higher area food prices. It is possible that these outcomes would be
likely to respond only after a longer, cumulative period of food insecurity, poor nutrition, or
reduced health care.

4.4

Summary Index Tests
To address concerns of multiple hypothesis testing, we conduct a collective test of these

health care utilization and health outcomes by constructing summary index estimates as in
Kling, Liebman, and Katz (2007). We normalize and combine the outcomes into a health care
utilization index and a health index, changing signs when necessary so that all positive
outcomes mean more health care utilization or better health outcomes. The index for health
care utilization includes the variables for checkups, any doctor visits, delay seeking health care,
and ER visit. The summary index for health outcomes includes health status, hospitalization,

21

emotional problems, and school days missed.
Results are shown in Table 5. We find that a 10% increase in SNAP purchasing power leads
to a statistically significant 0.09 standard deviation increase in health care utilization. We find
positive but not significant effects on SNAP children’s health; a 10% increase in SNAP
purchasing power leads to a statistically insignificant 0.03 standard deviation increase of the
health measure.
Broadly, we interpret our results (in Tables 3 and 5) as suggesting that children in
households facing lower SNAP purchasing power receive less preventive and ambulatory care.
Our findings for health outcomes (Tables 4 and 5) suggest that variation in the real value of
SNAP may lead to changes in school attendance but has no overall impact on children’s
contemporaneous health. A weakness of measuring health using the number of school days
missed due to illness is that it may depend on the parent’s evaluation of the child’s health;
however, parent-reported child health status, which is also a subjective measure, does not
appear to respond to variation in the real value of SNAP. On the other hand, the number of
missed school days is perhaps the only health outcome we analyze that might be expected to
respond contemporaneously to reduced nutrition or limited use of preventive/ambulatory
health care.

5

Mechanisms and Robustness Checks

5.1 Mechanisms
We outlined three possible mechanisms for effects of SNAP purchasing power on child
health care utilization and health including: direct (nutrition) effects, indirect (other goods)

22

effects, and stress/bandwidth effects.
One test for the direct channel is to examine impacts of SNAP purchasing power on food
insecurity. Children in families facing higher SNAP purchasing power may be able to consume
more (or higher quality) food which may then lead to a reduction in food insecurity. Because
the NHIS did not provide information on food security or nutritional intake in the years of data
we analyze, we turn to data from the December food security supplement to the CPS to
estimate the impact of SNAP purchasing power on food insecurity among SNAP-recipient
children.
We display these results in Table 6.27 We find that a higher real value of SNAP benefits is
associated with an improvement in children’s food security: A 10 percent increase in SNAP
purchasing power reduces the likelihood a child is food insecure by 6.4 percentage points (a
21.8 percent decrease relative to the mean). These results are qualitatively quite similar to
those in Gregory and Coleman-Jensen (2013), which used fewer years of the same data and a
different estimation strategy. The result for very low food security (column 2) is not statistically
significant; however, we note that very low food security is a rare outcome even for SNAP
children (only 4 percent of the children in our sample are very food insecure while almost 30
percent are food insecure). In particular, very low food security requires not only that
households are uncertain of obtaining an adequate quantity and quality of food due to money
or resources, but that they also restrict or disrupt food intake because of lack of resources. It is
perhaps not surprising, then, that this more extreme outcome is not significantly responsive to

27 The regression specifications include the same set of controls as in Tables 3 and 4 except because we cannot identify

counties in the CPS, we do not control for local CPI for nonfood nor the HUD fair market rent data which are measured at the
county level.

23

marginal variation in area food prices.
Overall, these results are suggestive that the direct effect may be part of the mechanism for
our findings. In addition, they confirm a well-studied and robust finding that higher SNAP
generosity leads to a reduction in food insecurity (Hoynes and Schanzenbach 2016). This is
important as it provides validation for our research design.
In Table 7 we investigate whether the impacts of SNAP on health care utilization and health
could be explained by a relationship between SNAP purchasing power and health insurance
coverage. Such a relationship would be unexpected for this sample, given that SNAP recipient
children are all likely to be income-eligible for Medicaid or CHIP. Returning to our sample of
NHIS children, we estimate equation (1), where the dependent variable is now an indicator for
whether the child is uninsured. Reassuringly, for both children in the Sample Child file and all
NHIS children, we find no statistically significant effect of SNAP purchasing power on the
likelihood a child has no health insurance. Additionally, Appendix Table 4 shows no relationship
between SNAP purchasing power and child participation in other food and nutrition programs.
Two of our most robust findings – that higher SNAP purchasing power leads to reductions in
school absences and increases in compliance with well child checkups – are consistent with the
stress and bandwidth channel. We are limited in our ability to test more directly for this
channel, though the NHIS does include mental health variables for the sample adult. These
include questions related to how often the respondent felt sad, worthless, nervous, hopeless,
etc. We analyzed these variables for sample adults who were mothers of the children in our
sample and found small and statistically insignificant effects.

24

5.2 SNAP Purchasing Power versus Local Prices
A natural check of our main results is to estimate our models for health care utilization and
health outcomes on a placebo sample of children that should not be affected by SNAP. We
present results for two groups: noncitizen children (who are not eligible for SNAP) and children
living in households with incomes that would make them ineligible for SNAP. 28 Appendix Figure
5 shows SNAP participation by bins of family income to poverty; we assign the placebo income
sample for incomes between 300-450% of poverty. If our main results reflect impacts of SNAP
on children’s health, rather than simply impacts of local food prices, we would expect SNAP
purchasing power to have no significant impact on these placebo samples.
These results are presented in Table 8. Panel A presents estimates for the higher income
sample, and Panel B presents estimates for noncitizen children. Estimated coefficients for our
key outcomes (i.e., had check-up, had any doctor’s visit, and number of school days missed) are
small and statistically insignificant, as are estimated effects on most other outcomes. Two
exceptions are that for the higher income sample, we find a statistically significant effect of
SNAP purchasing power on whether a child visited the ER in the past year and on whether a
child is obese. For the sample of noncitizen children, we find only a marginally significant,
negative coefficient for whether the child has an emotional problem. Recall, however, that
none of these outcomes was found to respond significantly to SNAP purchasing power among
SNAP recipient children. These findings are also reflected in estimates on the summary indexes
(see Appendix Table 5). There are small and statistically insignificant coefficients for noncitizen
children. The estimated effect on the health care utilization index for the higher income

28 As before, this sample is limited to children ages 0 through 17 who are citizens of the United States.

25

placebo group is half the size of our main effect, and statistically significant at the 10% level.
Appendix Table 6 shows there is no impact of SNAP purchasing power on child food insecurity
in these placebo samples. The bottom row of Appendix Table 5 shows SNAP participation in
these samples, which is low (4 percent or less) for high income children and 13 to 18 percent
for non-citizens.
Finally, we also explore the sensitivity of our findings to whether we control for non-food
regional CPI price controls (such as housing, energy, transportation, et cetera). As shown in
Appendix Table 7, our results are robust to the inclusion of these factors, suggesting that we
are not simply capturing the broader effects of living in a more or less expensive market.29

5.3 Robustness Checks
Table 9 displays the results of a series of robustness checks to our main findings regarding
the impacts of SNAP purchasing power on health care utilization and health. In panel A, we reestimate the models including a lead term that uses the t+1 market group TFP price. This lead
specification provides a test for the validity of our fixed effects design. If we find significant
effects of future SNAP purchasing power (while controlling for current purchasing power) we
might be concerned that we are capturing the effects of some other trend in the regions. That
is, we estimate:
(2)

𝑦𝑖𝑟𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 ln (

𝑆𝑁𝐴𝑃𝑀𝐴𝑋𝑡
𝑇𝐹𝑃𝑟𝑡

𝑆𝑁𝐴𝑃𝑀𝐴𝑋𝑡+1

) + 𝛽2 ln (

𝑇𝐹𝑃𝑟,𝑡+1

) 𝑋𝑖𝑟𝑡 𝜃 + 𝑍𝑟𝑡 𝛾 + 𝛿𝑡 + 𝜆𝑟 + 𝜀𝑖𝑟𝑡

Only in one of the ten specifications, is the lead of SNAP purchasing power significant.
Importantly, our results for the contemporaneous effect of SNAP purchasing power are largely

29 In results not shown here, we estimated models where we dropped the non-food regional CPI price controls and the state

SNAP and other policy controls, and find very similar results.

26

unchanged: The magnitudes of the estimated coefficients for “had checkup” and “school days
missed” are quite similar to those in Tables 3 and 4. One exception is that the estimated impact
of current-period SNAP purchasing power on whether a child had any doctor’s visit in the past
12 months is a third as large and is no longer statistically significant.
The second panel of Table 9 contains results from a model that includes a set of market
group linear time trends. This approach places serious demands on the data in that
identification now must come from departures in market groups’ TFP prices from their trends
(assumed to be linear). While the main estimates for health care utilization (had checkup, had
any doctor’s visit) are qualitatively similar to those in Table 3, they are smaller in magnitude
and no longer statistically significant. The estimated impact of SNAP purchasing power on
missed school days, however, remains nearly identical in magnitude and significance to that in
Table 4.
Finally, to address concerns that inclusion in our SNAP recipient sample may be endogenous
to SNAP purchasing power, we estimate the impacts of variation in SNAP purchasing power on
health care utilization and health for a high intent-to-treat population. In particular, we identify
a sample of children living with unmarried parent(s) with less than a college education.30 The
results (in panel C of Table 9 along with the index models in column 3 of Appendix Table 5)
show qualitatively similar findings. Again, the estimated impacts on the likelihood of a checkup
and on the number of missed school days are quite similar in magnitude to those for our main
sample (although the p-value on the coefficient for missed school days rises to 0.141). The

30 Even though this is a high-ITT group, observable characteristics show that it is more advantaged, on average, than the SNAP

population.

27

estimated relationship between SNAP purchasing power and having had any doctor’s visit is
smaller and no longer statistically significant. Interestingly, we document a negative effect of
increased SNAP purchasing power on ER utilization for this somewhat higher-income sample: a
10 percent increase in the ratio (SNAPMAX/TFP) reduces the likelihood of an ER visit by 4.8
percentage points.

6

Discussion and Conclusion
In this paper we provide some of the first direct evidence on how variation in the

purchasing power of SNAP benefits affects children’s health care utilization and health
outcomes. We find evidence consistent with families adjusting to lower SNAP purchasing
power by reducing utilization of preventive/ambulatory medical care. In particular, we
document that a 10 percent increase in SNAP purchasing power increases the likelihood a child
had a check-up in the past year by 8.1 percent and increases the likelihood that children had
any doctor’s visit in the past 12 months by 3.4 percent.
We do not find much evidence that lower SNAP purchasing power causes detrimental
impacts on health status, the likelihood of a hospitalization, or other measures of physical (e.g.,
obesity) and mental health (e.g., child has emotional problems). One exception is that children
with reduced SNAP purchasing power miss significantly more days of school due to illness (22
percent more, relative to a baseline mean of 5 missed days, when SNAP purchasing power is
reduced by 10 percent). We also find that lower purchasing power of SNAP benefits results in a
greater likelihood of food insecurity.
One possible explanation for our finding stronger effects on utilization than on health itself

28

is that most of the health measures we consider are more chronic and cumulative in nature
(e.g., obesity). However, we also find no evidence of a relationship between SNAP purchasing
power and caregiver-reported health status, an outcome which could be less likely to suffer
from the same problem. A second possible interpretation of our findings is that while lower
SNAP purchasing power causes reduced health care utilization among children and negatively
affects food security, neither translates into substantial detrimental impacts on children’s
health status.
We also note that our measure of variation in the price of food is constructed using 30
market groups that perhaps mask variation in urban and rural customers who are in fact paying
different prices, thus masking why certain SNAP recipients are able to buy relatively
inexpensive food and stay relatively healthy. In related work, Bronchetti and Christensen (2017)
use food prices measured at a much finer geographic level from the National Household Food
Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS) and demonstrate that whether SNAP benefits are
sufficient to buy the TFP depends largely on whether recipients are able to identify and travel
to the lowest-cost store in their area. Relating health and other outcomes to SNAP purchasing
power using finer geographic variation may be a fruitful research area in the future.
Finally, our results speak to whether adjusting benefit levels to account for geographic
variation in food prices across market groups would help improve child health and wellbeing.
We conclude that such adjustment would reduce disparities in child healthcare utilization and
school absenteeism in low-income households, but may not lead to significant changes in
contemporaneous health status.

indicators for the mother's (father's) presence and the mother's (father's) education, marital status, age, and citizenship. All
regressions also include controls for local economic and policy variables: the county unemployment rate, an index of state SNAP
policies (Ganong and Liebman, 2015), the state minimum wage, EITC, and Medicaid/CHIP income eligibility limits, TANF generosity,
as well as controls for HUD’s fair market rent, and regional CPIs for non-food, non-housing categories (apparel, commodities,

Notes: Results from weighted OLS regressions. Standard errors in parentheses are corrected for clustering at the market group level; *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. All regressions include controls for the
child's age (and its square), whether the child is black or Hispanic, the child's family size, indicators for the presence of the mother (and/or father) in the household, and interactions between indicators for
the mother's (father's) presence and the mother's (father's) education, marital status, age, and citizenship. Insurance coverage not included as control in columns 1 and 5. All regressions also include
controls for local economic and policy variables: the county unemployment rate, an index of state SNAP policies (Ganong and Liebman, 2015), the state minimum wage, EITC, TANF generosity, and
Medicaid/CHIP income eligibility limits, as well as controls for HUD’s fair market rent, and regional CPIs for non-food, non-housing categories (apparel, commodities, education, medical, recreation,
services, transportation and other). Finally, all models include year and market group fixed effects. Outcomes in Panel A, columns 1-3, and outcomes on Panel B, columns 1-4 are observed only for
children in the Sample Child files.
