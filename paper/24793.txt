Some Facts of High-Tech Patenting

NBER Working Paper No. 24793

JEL No. L86,O34
ABSTRACT
Patenting in software, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence has grown rapidly in recent
years. Such patents are acquired primarily by large US technology firms such as IBM, Microsoft,
Google, and HP, as well as by Japanese multinationals such as Sony, Canon, and Fujitsu. Chinese
patenting in the US is small but growing rapidly, and world-leading for drone technology.
Patenting in machine learning has seen exponential growth since 2010, although patenting in
neural networks saw a strong burst of activity in the 1990s that has only recently been surpassed.
In all technological fields, the number of patents per inventor has declined near-monotonically,
except for large increases in inventor productivity in software and semiconductors in the late
1990s. In most high-tech fields, Japan is the only country outside the US with significant US
patenting activity; however, whereas Japan played an important role in the burst of neural
network patenting in the 1990s, it has not been involved in the current acceleration. Comparing
the periods 1970-89 and 2000-15, patenting in the current period has been primarily by entrant
assignees, with the exception of neural networks.

Introduction

Economists have increasingly recognized the impact of legal and economic institutions on the process of
growth (La Porta et al., 1998; Acemoglu et al., 2002). One of the most important of these is the patent
system, which economists have argued has the potential to provide a critical spur to innovation.1 Ideally,
it has been argued, patents rewards inventors in a manner that is commensurate with the nature of their
discoveries (e.g., see the discussion in Scotchmer, 2004). But important questions surround whether the
patent system can adequately address fundamentally new areas of technology. Among the barriers to
efficacious patent awards that have been highlighted by academics and practitioners are the difficulty of
defining patentable subject matter, the relative inexperience of patent examiners with these technologies,
and the absence of patented prior art.
Perhaps no area has been more contentious than software patenting.2 Bessen and Hunt (2007) document the dramatic increase in software patenting between 1976 and 2002. This surge in patenting accelerated after the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in the 1981 case of Diamond v. Diehr, which established
that software used for industrial purposes could be patentable, and the Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit’s ruling in State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group, which established that a numerical calculation that produces a ”useful, concrete and tangible result”, such as a price, is patent-eligible. Bessen and
Hunt (2007) highlight that the growth in patenting was driven by large manufacturing firms in industries
known for strategic behavior. Software patenting seems orthogonal to changes in software R&D, programmer employment, or other indicators. In general, the firms undertaking software patenting actually had
lower R&D intensity then their peers.
In this paper, we revisit this territory, focusing on awards in software and related technologies over
the past two decades, including cloud computing and artificial intelligence. This region has seen dramatic
changes over this period, beginning with a series of widely discussed decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court
that have altered the costs and benefits of pursuing these awards. Most notable were the 2009 ruling in In re
Bilski, which raised substantial questions about the patentability of business method patents, and CLS Bank
International v. Alice Corp., a 2014 decision that raised questions as to the extent to which implementing an
existing process in software would be patentable.
This period has also seen dramatic changes in firm behavior regarding patents. In particular, firms
appear to be increasingly using these awards as part of battles for market dominance. Perhaps no more
dramatic illustration is the litigation around smartphone technology: litigation across at least 10 countries enveloped these devices, with at least 50 lawsuits between Apple and Samsung and, until their May
2014 settlement agreement, 20 cases between Apple and Google. (These tabulations do not count the
on-going lawsuits between Google and the Rockstar Consortium, whose members include Apple, Black1

There is, of course, a large literature on patents. Representative papers include Griliches (1998), Lanjouw et al. (1998), Jaffe
and Trajtenberg (2002), Hall et al. (2005), Galasso et al. (2013), Cohen et al. (2014), Dorn et al. (2016), and Kogan et al. (2017).

Recent literature on software patenting includes Allison and Tiller (2003), Graham and Mowery (2003), Hall and MacGarvie
(2010), Mann (2004), and Shalem and Trajtenberg (2009).

Berry, Ericsson, Microsoft, and Sony, and which purchased for $4.5 billion the patent portfolio of bankrupt
multinational telecommunications and data networking equipment manufacturer Nortel in 2011). Other
illustrations would include litigation around self-driving car software between Uber and Waymo, and
the efforts on the part of Microsoft to shield its cloud users from infringement suits through aggressive
licensing.
We document a continued dramatic increase in software patents during the course of the twenty-first
century, with a 60.2% increase in ultimately successful filings between 2000 and 2013, and a 168.6% increase in applications over the same period. The rate of increase—albeit on a modest base—is far more
dramatic for many of the emerging technologies, such as drones, cloud computing, and machine learning.
We show that these new technological fields are characterized by rapid bursts of innovation from a relatively small group of inventors, followed by a slowing down in per-inventor productivity as more inventors
pursue these opportunities. Invention remains dominated by U.S., Japanese, and Korean inventors, many
of them at large firms with a strong patenting history.
While we are unable to answer the question of the social desirability of these awards, we hope to explore these issues in future research. In particular, in subsequent work, we will examine the impact of these
awards on market valuations, particularly around the major judicial decisions alluded to above. Nonetheless, given the plausibility that today’s legal and economic institutions surrounding intellectual property
will have major effects on the future technological landscape of software, artificial intelligence, and cloud
computing—as well as technologies that are critically software-dependent, including smartphones and
self-driving cars—collecting systematic evidence on patenting around these different technologies appears
to be an important task.
The plan of this paper is as follows. We provide an introduction to the data sources and methodology
we use in Section 2. Sections 3 through 6 focus on the number of applications and awards, the number and
geographic distribution of inventors, and the top assignees respectively. Section 7 seeks to understand the
extent to which new patents are coming from current versus new inventors. The final section provides an
agenda for future research in these areas.

Data and definitions

We use the IFI Claims patents dataset as our source of information on patents.3 This dataset contains the
full text of all published US patent documents through February 2018 obtained from USPTO bulk files.
We consider all patent publications with non-missing title, abstract, description, assignee, and inventor
fields. In some cases we restrict to granted patents, as described in the text; in other cases we consider all
applications. We do not make any other restrictions, such as considering only utility patents or excluding
continuation patents.

The dataset is accessed at https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/patents-public-data:patents.publications.

We describe how we classify patents as corresponding to particular classes of technology below. First,
however, we make some observations about the patent data in general. When analyzing patent assignees,
we face three data quality issues. The first is name harmonization. For example, patents assigned to IBM
may list ”IBM” or ”International Business Machines”, or some misspelling of these, as the assignee. It
is important for our purposes to analyze them as belonging to the same, single assignee. The IFI Claims
dataset uses the EPO’s list of standardized applicant names4 to harmonize assignee names. This substantially solves the name harmonization problem.
The second issue concerns reassignments. In the course of our analysis, we discovered that in many
cases the USPTO data files incorrectly list the inventors of patents as the assignees. This issue appears to
begin after the year 2000. A separate USPTO data product, the USPTO Patent Assignment Dataset (Marco
et al., 2015), records re-assignments to employers, as well as reassignments for other reasons, such as securitization or acquisition. The dataset attempts to classify reassignments as initial employer assignments
or reassignments for other reasons. We plan to use the initial employer assignments if necessary, but not
reassignments for other reasons. Currently, we are not accounting for any reassignments.
The third issue concerns subsidiaries. Large parts of a parent company’s patent portfolio may be assigned to their subsidiaries. This may be for many reasons: the subsidiary may have joined the parent
company through an acquisition; the subsidiary may be used to maintain secrecy about the parent’s innovative activities for strategic reasons; there may be tax advantages to assigning patents to subsidiaries
in foreign jurisdictions; and patents may be assigned to a subsidiary in order to prepare the subsidiary
to be spun out or sold. In one famous example, Ewing and Feldman (2012) identify 1,276 separate shell
companies operated by Intellectual Ventures, a company that owns and licenses large numbers of patents.
Failing to trace the ultimate owner of a given patent via a corporate tree would mean missing key features of the changing landscape of patent ownership. This is something we are currently working on with
Innography, a private provider of patent data that specializes in tracing the ultimate owners of patents. In
the current draft, we do not use the Innography data.

2.1

Definitions

We consider patents corresponding to several technological fields as defined in Table 1. Some definitions
use keyword inclusion/exclusion criteria for text fields as in Webb et al. (2018). Others use Cooperative
Patent Classification (CPC) codes. The fields were selected, first, to represent a range of areas against which
to compare our results for software, and second, to highlight the patenting landscape around important
emerging technologies. We use two different definitions of software patents: one from Bessen and Hunt
(2007), and the other from Webb et al. (2018). These definitions are discussed in Appendix A.1.
To illustrate the kinds of technologies being patented within each of our technology classes, we con4

1970s/80s period and the 2000s/2010s period. The tables in Appendix A.2 display the 4-digit CPC code
prefixes that were most frequently assigned to the patents in each technology class.

Patent applications v. grants

The figures in this section display counts of patent applications and patent grants for each technology
by filing year. Note that the USPTO only started publishing patent applications (rather than grants) filed
on or after November 29, 2000, and publishes them eighteen months after the effective filing date of the
application. The change in 2000 is clear in the figure below.
It should be noted that in each case, the number of patent grants falls off at the end of the sample. This
reflects the truncation of awards affected by long patent processing times. Many of the awards in 2015
(and even earlier years) had not issued by the beginning of 2018. (For a fuller discussion, see Lerner and
Seru, 2017).
The growth of software patents increased sharply after 2000, particularly when patent applications
are considered. The number of software patent applications grew by 168.6% between 2000 and 2013.
This growth mirrors that of patents more generally: patent applications overall grew by 122.6% over the
same period. As we move into more recent technologies, such as cloud, drones, machine learning, and
self-driving cars, the growth is far more dramatic. Meanwhile, the number of issued awards in internal
combustion engines and pharmaceuticals, included for the sake of comparison, has been nearly flat.

Inventors

We calculate the number of patents per inventor for each technology class in each year. Specifically, we
divide the number of distinct patent application numbers by the number of distinct harmonized inventor
names. Each figure plots, for a given technology class, the patent count, the inventor count, and (on the
right-hand-side axis) the patents per inventor. For each technology class, we plot these numbers for all
patent applications. The patterns for granted patents are very similar.
The most striking finding is the rapid fall in patents per inventor once each field opens up. It appears
new technology fields are characterized by rapid bursts of innovation from a relatively small group of
inventors followed by a fanning out and slowing down in per-inventor productivity. Of course, we cannot
control for patent quality – later patents may be more valuable – but typically earlier patents in new fields
are more highly cited, so the downward slope in research productivity within fields may even be stronger
than depicted, after accounting for patent quality. This is something that is discussed at length in Bloom
et al. (2017), reflecting a general trend towards “ideas getting harder to find” over time.
One interesting dynamic seen in many of the technologies is a dip in patents per inventor around 1994.
The year 1995 saw one of the most dramatic recent shifts of patent policy, in which the adoption of the
Uruguay Round of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights led to a shift
in U.S. awards from seventeen years from the award date to twenty years from the filing date. Patent
applicants in the months before June 1995 allowed inventors the longer of the two forms of protection, a
potentially valuable consideration. One possibility is that this policy shift triggered filings by a broader
range of inventors, leading to a fall in the number of applications per inventor.

We also considered changes in the geographic distribution of inventors. Below, each figure plots, for a
given technology class, the number of patents filed at the USPTO each year by inventors in a given country.
For each figure, only the top ten countries by total patent application count over the period 1970-2015
are displayed. (The results for patent grants look very similar.) A few basic results jump out. First, the
dominance of the US, which is not surprising given its technological lead and the home bias in analyzing
US patent data. Second, the particular dominance of the US in some of the most recent technologies, such
as cloud, machine learning, and neural networks (noting the Japanese surge and fall in the 1990s). In
comparison, in semi-conductors and combustion engines the US is tracked closely by Japan.
Interestingly, the share of Chinese patentees remains very modest in most technologies, with the exceptions of drones and smartphones, which have seen recent rapid rises.

Top assignees (granted patents)

We also considered changes in the identities of the top assignees in each technology class over time. Each
table below displays, for a given technology class, the total number of patents granted to each of the top
10 assignees by total patents granted over the periods 1970-99 (left panel) and 2000-15 (right panel).
What is striking here is how little change there is between patents applied for between 1970 and 1999
and between 2000 and 2015. Consistent with Bessen and Hunt (2007), the applications are dominated by
some of the largest U.S., Japanese, and (in the more recent sample) Korean technology firms that have
traditionally been active patent filers. As we move into some of the newer technologies, however, we
see a more diverse array of patentees, including some newer software-focused firms, Chinese firms, and
individual inventors.
Note that these results do not account for corporate ownership structure. For example, when counting
any company’s patents, we consider only the parent company and do not account for patents owned by
subsidiaries. We are working to address this issue.

Within/between decomposition

For each technological field, we decompose the growth in patent applications between the periods 19701989 and 2000-present into growth in patent applications by current inventors (within) versus new inventors (between).
We write
Pt =

X

si,t ωi,t ,

i

where si,t is inventor i’s share of all patent applications in period t, where coauthoured patents count
P
fractionally so that i si,t = 1; and ωi,t is the fraction of inventor i’s patents that are patents in the given
technological field.
We decompose5 the change in the share of patenting in a given technological field between two periods
as
Pt − Pt−1 =

X

si,t ωi,t −

i

=

X

si,t−1 ωi,t−1

si,t−1 ωi,t − ωi,t−1 (within)


si,t ωi,t − Pt−1 (entry)


si,t−1 ωi,t−1 − Pt−1 (exit),

i∈EXIT

where C is the set of continuing inventors, ENT the set of entrants (who patent in period t but not t − 1),
and EXIT the set of exiters (who patent in period t − 1 but not t).
To simplify the presentation, we amalgamate between, cross, entry, and exit into between, i.e.,
between = Pt − Pt−1 − within.
The results are displayed in the figures below. Most of the new, rapidly growing technologies are
almost all between, whereas the older ones — pharma and engines — are heavily within. Thus, in established technological domains, most of the changes in patenting seem to come from dominant incumbent
firms, whereas patenting in more cutting-edge areas appears to be dominated by new entrants.

This decomposition is as defined in Haltiwanger (1997). It differs from the Baily, Hulten and Campbell (1992) decomposition
in some important respects, as detailed in the appendix of Haltiwanger (1997).

Conclusion

This paper has identified some stylized facts about the growth of patenting in software, cloud computing,
artificial intelligence, and related technologies in the twentieth-first century. It highlights the continuing
growth of this activity, as well as the continuing dominance of inventors in large U.S., Japanese, and Korean
companies. The paper also documents a shared pattern in the evolution of the mixture and productivity
of inventors over time.
The analysis raises a number of unanswered issues. Foremost among these is understanding the value
of these awards. This question has two dimensions. The first, which we are currently investigating, relates
to the private returns to these awards. In particular, we are examining the market reaction to awards before
and after some of the key judicial decisions relating to software patents, as well as the different changes in
market value around the time of these decisions.
The second, more difficult question was alluded to in the introduction: the impact of these awards on
social welfare more generally. To what extent can the seemingly deleterious effects identified by Bessen
and Hunt (2007) be corroborated? Do these patterns hold across all aspects of software, or just in certain
segments? These issues, while challenging, will reward scrutiny in the years to come.

Appendices

A.1

Software definitions

We use two sets of criteria for classifying software patents. The first is taken from Bessen and Hunt (2007).
The authors of that paper note: “our concept of software patent involves a logic algorithm for processing
data that is implemented via stored instructions; that is, the logic is not ‘hard-wired.’ These instructions
could reside on a disk or other storage medium or they could be stored in ‘firmware,’ that is, a read-only
memory, as is typical of embedded software. But we want to exclude inventions that do not use software
as part of the invention. For example, some patents reference off-the-shelf software used to determine
key parameters of the invention; such uses do not make the patent a software patent.” Bessen and Hunt
(2007) manually selected an algorithm, described in Table 1, intended to capture this sense of software,
and performed various validation checks.
We also use the criteria for classifying software patents developed in Webb et al. (2018). This algorithm
is based on that in Bessen and Hunt (2007), but uses titles and abstracts instead of the specification – also
known as the ‘technical description’ field. This is in order to include patents filed at patent offices other
than the USPTO, for which the technical description field is generally lacking in the patent database. Of
course, in this paper, we are restricting to patents filed at the USPTO.
As can be seen from the figures in Section 3, the Bessen and Hunt (2007) definition is far more expansive, encompassing almost 5 times as many patents in recent years as the Webb et al. (2018) definition. Note
also that using the Bessen and Hunt (2007) defintion, there are almost 5 times as many software patents
as semiconductor patents. That said, the two definitions display very similar patterns in all our results.

CPC assignments

We consider how the CPC codes to which patent applications in each technology class were assigned
changed between the 1970s/80s period and the 2000s/2010s period. The tables below display the 4-digit
CPC code prefixes that were most frequently assigned to the patent applications in each technology class,
ranked by frequency in the second period.
