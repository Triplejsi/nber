Too little or too much? Actionable Advice in an Early-Childhood Text Messaging Experiment

ABSTRACT
Text-message based parenting programs have proven successful in improving parental
engagement and preschoolers’ literacy development. The tested programs have provided a
combination of (a) general information about important literacy skills, (b) actionable advice (i.e.,
specific examples of such activities), and (c) encouragement. The regularity of the texts – each
week throughout the school year – also provided nudges to focus parents’ attention on their
children. This study seeks to identify mechanisms of the overall effect of such programs. It
investigates whether the actionable advice alone drives previous study’s results and whether
additional texts of actionable advice improve program effectiveness. The findings provide
evidence that text messaging programs can supply too little or too much information. A single
text per week is not as effective at improving parenting practices as a set of three texts that also
include information and encouragement, but a set of five texts with additional actionable advice is
also not as effective as the three-text approach. The results on children’s literacy development
depend strongly on the child’s pre-intervention literacy skills. For children in the lowest quarter
of the pre-treatment literacy assessments, only providing one example of an activity decreases
literacy scores by 0.15 standard deviations relative to the original intervention. Literacy scores of
children in higher quarters are marginally higher with only one tip per week. We find no positive
effects of increasing to five texts per week.

Introduction
Parents almost invariably aim for their children to succeed in school and beyond, and often

are their children’s first teacher (Stevenson, Chen, and Uttal, 1990). Yet, many parents struggle to
provide the necessary support due to limited resources, lack of information, and behavioral
challenges. As a result, early home learning environments of children differ substantially (Bradley,
Corwyn, Burchinal, McAdoo, and Coll, 2001).1 These differences perpetuate discrepancies in
educational attainment and professional success later in life (Heckman, 2006). To close learning
gaps, a variety of programs has aimed at improving parenting practices. However, many of these
parenting programs have shown only limited success, at least in part, due to high demands on
parents’ time, infrequency, and information delivery that is difficult for parents to operationalize.
Some of the more successful programs are costly and difficult to scale (Aos, Lieb, Mayfield,
Miller, and Pennucci, 2004; Duncan, Ludwig, and Magnusson, 2010; Karoly, Greenwood,
Everingham, Houbé, Rydell et al., 1998).
Text-messaging interventions have emerged as a promising alternative or supplement due
to their low cost, the widespread use of mobile phones, and their ease of scalability. These
interventions have been shown to positively influence both student and parent outcomes in a wide
array of educational settings.2 In particular, a text-messaging program developed at Stanford
University improved parental engagement and children’s literacy development by overcoming

1

For example, Hart and Risley (1995) estimate that children from low-income families hear about 30 million fewer
words at the age of four than children from high-income families.
2
Such interventions have been demonstrated to positively affect school and class attendance of students (Bergman
and Chan, 2017; Groot, Sander, Rogers, and Bloomenthal, 2017), the number of course credits earned in high school
(Kraft and Rogers, 2015), FASFA completion (Page, Castleman, and Meyer, 2016), and college enrollment rates
(Castleman and Page, 2015, 2016). Moreover, these interventions have been particularly effective for children and
parents from low-income backgrounds (Bergman, 2015; Castleman and Page, 2015, 2016; Bergman and Chan, 2017).

behavioral barriers to good parenting (Doss, Fahle, Loeb, and York, in press; York, Loeb, and
Doss, in press). This texting intervention breaks down the complexities of parenting by providing
a combination of general information about important literacy skills and parent-child activities
(i.e., “FACT” text messages), actionable advice with specific examples of parent-child literacy
activities (i.e., “TIP” text messages), and encouragement/reinforcement (i.e., “GROWTH” text
messages).
In this study, we analyze the importance of content and frequency of the text messages in
the context of the Stanford parenting program. Specifically, we focus on the provision of
actionable advice in the form of concrete examples of early literacy activities. We extend prior
findings by answering two questions. First, does the actionable advice (i.e., examples of activities)
in the “TIP” message drive previous results or is the addition of general information and
encouragement/reinforcement through the “FACT” and “GROWTH” texts more important for
increasing parent-child interactions and child development? Second, does the provision of more
activities through two additional “TIP” messages further improve parent-child interactions and
child development?
We study these two interrelated questions in a randomized experiment. We assign parents
of pre-kindergarten children into three experimental groups. The first group of parents only
receives one “TIP” message on Wednesdays, henceforth the Tip program. The second group
receives the original program (i.e., “FACT” message on Mondays, “TIP” message on Wednesdays,
and “GROWTH” message on Fridays), which we call the FTG program (or original program).
The third group receives the “FACT” message on Mondays, “TIP” messages on Tuesdays,
Wednesdays, and Thursdays, and the “GROWTH” message on Fridays (i.e., the original program
and two additional “TIP” messages), henceforth the FTTTG program.
3

Two prior studies have assessed the effectiveness of the FTG program. The first of these,
York et al. (in press), estimated the average treatment effect compared to a control group and found
substantial positive effects of the program on children’s early literacy skills. These positive effects
were largely driven by children who started the year in the lower half of literacy development. The
second paper, Doss et al. (in press), tested whether the content of texts mattered or whether the
benefits were driven solely by the reminder of getting a text about parenting. To investigate
whether content mattered, the study compared the original FTG program to one that provided tips
that better matched the skill level of the children. The personalized and differentiated program
provided more difficult activities to children who demonstrated greater literacy skills on formative
assessments in the beginning and middle of the school year. This second paper found that targeting
texts based on skills improved results even further, as children who started the year in the bottom
or top third of the literacy distribution benefited more from the differentiated program while those
who started in the middle third did not.
Thus, to date, we have evidence that the content of the tips matters for the effectiveness of
the FTG program. We do not, however, know whether the other elements of the FTG program are
beneficial or whether one “TIP” text per week design provides enough actionable advice. Filling
this gap in knowledge can guide a more efficient and effective program design and shed light on
the process of parent behavior change that can inform a much broader array of programs. For
instance, if the Tip program has the same effect as the FTG program on children’s early literacy
skills, sending one text-message per week instead of three text-messages per week is more efficient
and perhaps less burdensome to already busy parents. It also shows that parents do not need
information as much implementation help. Alternatively, if the FTTTG program has a more

4

positive effect than the FTG program, program effectiveness can be increased by providing more
activities and that parents benefit from a greater quantity of support each week.
When designing the FTG program, we hypothesized that at least four factors may hinder
good parenting practices. The first is imperfect information about what skills are important for
children to develop.3 The “FACT” texts provide this information. While parents can still do the
suggested activities in the “TIP” texts and benefit from them even without this information, having
the information from the “FACT” texts may allow parents to better extrapolate from the suggested
activity in the “TIP” text and provide other similar opportunities to their children. Thus, including
a “FACT” text could add further benefits. Both the FTG and the FTTTG programs include the
“FACT”, but the Tip program does not.
The second factor that potentially hinders parenting practices is the cognitive load of
parenting, specifically, the burden that having to decide what activities to do with a child can place
on a parent. Even if parents are knowledgeable about the “right” parenting practices, some parents
might be overwhelmed by the complexity of raising a child. The cognitive demand of the multitude
of choices to support their child’s development involved in every parent-child interaction might
lead them to engage sub-optimally with their child.4 Moreover, the cognitive demand of parenting
might be particularly challenging to parents who have financial concerns and other demands on

3

Recent literature on the provision of information on educational choices provides mixed results. While Avery and
Kane (2004) and Grodsky and Jones (2007) find little evidence that lack of information about the costs and benefits
associated with higher education can explain differences in college attendance, other studies find that information can
influence school choices, student outcomes, and major choices (Fricke, Grogger, and Steinmayr, 2018; Hastings and
Weinstein, 2008; Valant and Loeb, 2014). Moreover, studies show that text messages to parents about their child’s
school absences increase parental involvement in supporting academic work, reduce absences (Rogers and Feller,
2016), and increase credit accumulation in high school (Kraft and Rogers, 2015).
4
Iyengar and Lepper (2000) show that substantial choice one can lead to inaction. By reducing the selection of jams
offered to consumers, they increased purchases significantly. In education, Bettinger, Long, Oreopoulos, and
Sanbonmatsu (2012) show that assistance in filling out the complex Free Application for Federal Student Aid
(FAFSA) can increase the likelihood of submitting the application and of enrolling in college.

their time.5 The “TIP” texts aim to lighten the cognitive load by providing a suitable, easy, and fun
activity linked to the “FACT” text that the parent can have as a default.6 The “GROWTH” texts
include an activity that supplements the “TIPS” in providing default activities and reducing the
cognitive load of finding and choosing and activity. The optimal number of tips is unclear. On the
one hand, additional “TIP” texts may reduce the cognitive load further by giving parents default
activities multiple times. On the other hand, the additional “TIP” texts may exacerbate cognitive
demand as they provide more activities to read about and undertake. The FTG program has one
“TIP” plus the “GROWTH” activity, while the Tip program reduces the number of activities to
just one “TIP” and the FTTTG program increases the number of activities by adding two extra
“TIPs.”
The third factor is the delayed gratification of parenting, which in combination with timeinconsistent preferences, might lead parents to make suboptimal choices (DellaVigna, 2009;
Thaler and Sunstein, 2008). Parents might be tempted to engage in activities that make their child
happy at the present moment rather than engage in time consuming skill building and school
readiness activities, which may be rewarded only in the long run. The “GROWTH” text aims to
provide immediate gratification to parents with the encouraging words such as, “you are doing a
good job preparing your child for kindergarten.” Both the original FTG program and the FTTTG
program contain the “GROWTH” texts and they may provide some benefit over the Tip program
if delayed gratification is a salient factor.

5

Researchers have shown the existence of the scarcity phenomenon both in the laboratory and in contexts such as
farming (Shah, Mullainathan, and Shafir, 2012; Mani, Mullainathan, Shafir, and Zhao, 2013).
6
Bandura and Schunk (1981) show that such an approach can lead to increases and test scores and student confidence.

6

Finally, the fourth factor underlying the design of the original FTG program was that
limited attention could contribute to suboptimal parenting behavior.7 While parents want to support
the long-term development of their child, parenting requires sustained attention over many years
while the immediate demands of life could distract parents from their commitment. Texting
programs have proven effective at holding attention in a number of contexts such as learning,
smoking cessation, weight loss, taking medicine, and exercise.8 All three of the programs – Tip,
FTG, and FTTTG – provide reminders to parents each week about parenting. However, there is a
risk that more texts become bothersome to parents, leading them to stop paying attention or opt
out of receiving the text messages altogether.
The question of whether the Tip and FTTTG programs improve upon the FTG program is
an empirical one. On the one hand, the FTG and FTTTG programs provide general information
and gratification, and may reduce the cognitive demand further with additional activities. On the
other hand, additional burden of more texts may reduce the effectiveness of the programs. We find
that the original FTG program has benefits in comparison to the Tip program, suggesting that the
other elements of FTG are helping parents. Results from a parent survey suggest that providing
only one “TIP” decreases self-reported parental engagement by 0.22 to 0.36 standard deviations
(henceforth SDs) relative to the FTG program. However, the additional “TIPs” in the FTTTG
program are also not beneficial for parents and, in some cases, may be detrimental. The negative
effects of additional texts are seen in the opt out rates of parents who received the FTTTG program.

7

For example, Karlan, McConnell, Mullainathan, and Zinman (2010) show that sending regular reminders can
improve saving behavior.
8
See for example, Evans, Wallace, and Snider (2012); Head, Noar, Innarino, and Harrington (2013); Miltello, Kelly,
and Melnyk (2011); Pop-Eleches et al. (2011); Siopis, Chey, and Allman-Farinelli (2014); Traxler and Dearden
(2005); Vodopivec-Jamsek, de Jongh, Gurol-Urganci, Atun, and Car (2012); and Whittaker et al. (2012).

7

That is, parents in the FTTTG program are more likely to opt out of the intervention by 2.9
percentage points compared to those receiving the FTG program (a 58 percent increase over the
FTG program mean opt out of 5 percent), while parents who received the Tip program were 2.0
percentage points less likely to opt out (a 40 percent decline over the FTG program mean opt out
of 5 percent). Furthermore, the effects on child literacy development strongly depend on the child’s
pre-intervention literacy skills. Specifically, for children in the lowest quarter of the pre-treatment
literacy assessments, the Tip program decreases literacy scores by 0.15 SDs compared to also
providing general information as well as encouragement and reinforcement in the FTG program.
The literacy scores of children in the middle two quarters are higher in the Tip program than in the
original program, but these effects are only marginally significant. We find no effects for providing
additional examples of activities in the FTTTG program on children’s literacy test scores.

Experimental Design

A.

The Intervention
The FTG program is an eight-month-long text messaging pre-kindergarten program for

parents of four year olds designed to help them support their children’s academic development.
The program was first introduced in the San Francisco Unified School District during the 2013-14
school year. The Tip program and the FTTTG program are similar to the original program in all
aspects except in the number and content of texts per week. We designed them specifically for this
study.
The three programs draw on research on literacy development (e.g., Lonigan and
Shanahan, 2009), parenting practices (e.g., Reese, Sparks, and Leyva, 2010), and behavior change
strategies (e.g., Abraham and Michie, 2008). In developing the scope and sequence of the literacy
8

curriculum, we consulted a number of state standards for early literacy skills (e.g., Abbot, Lundin,
and Ong, 2008; Texas Education Agency, 2015). The texting curriculum is structured as a spiral
curriculum – it starts simple and becomes progressively more advanced over the eight months of
the intervention, and topics are reintroduced throughout the year for reinforcement. For example,
the first week of the program focuses on parent-child conversations, while the last few weeks
concentrate on developing high quality parent-child book reading routines.9 The texts cover a wide
range of literacy skills and related parenting practices, including: upper- and lower-case letter
recognition, letter sound awareness, beginning sound awareness, rhyme, name writing, concepts
of print, story comprehension, vocabulary, singing and listening to songs, self-narration, parentchild conversations, and parent-child book reading routines.
All text messages are couched in positive parenting practices (Parent Management
Training: Patterson, Reid, and Dishion, 1992; Incredible Years: Webster-Stratton, 1992; Triple PPositive Parenting Program: Sanders, Markie-Dadds, Tully, and Bor, 2000; VIPP-SD intervention:
Van Zeijl et al., 2006; and Family Check-Up: Gardner, Burton, and Klimes, 2006) with the goal
of making the activities fun and engaging for both parent and child. Our goal is for the activities
to both increase children’s school readiness skills and improve the parent-child relationship
through continuous positive interactions. Most of the texts relate to existing family routines and
activities. By building on these routines, we offer parents easy to implement choices and minimize
costs of adopting beneficial behavior. Parents do not have to create entirely new routines; they
merely add an additional step in their established parent-child interactions. For instance, some texts
leverage bath time, commuting and travel, or family meals.

See York et al. (in press) for a description of the original text development process.

We assign participating parents into three experimental groups, which differ in content and
frequency of texts: Tip, FTG and FTTTG. The first group of parents receives one “TIP” message
on Wednesdays. The second group receives a “FACT” message on Mondays, a “TIP” message on
Wednesdays, and a “GROWTH” message on Fridays. The third group receives a “FACT” message
on Mondays, a “TIP” message on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, and a “GROWTH”
message on Fridays.
To ensure comparability of treatments, the text message content is similar across treatment
groups. The Monday “FACT” texts are the same in both the original and the FTTTG programs.
The Tip program and the original program send the same “TIP” messages on Wednesdays.
However, rearrangement and adaptation of a few texts are necessary in the FTTTG program in
order to achieve a sensible progression of activities. Specifically, the FTTTG program sends
Wednesday’s “TIP” messages on Tuesdays, and the example in the “GROWTH” message is used
as Wednesday’s “TIP” message. Below we provide a literacy example of each treatment group
that focuses on letter recognition:10, 11

Study Participants
We ran this study in partnership with the Dallas Independent School District (ISD). Parents

of four-year-old preschoolers in the district received the texting intervention during the 2015-16
school year. The intervention launched in mid-November 2015, and delivered text messages
through June 24, 2016.
The Dallas ISD is the second-largest public school district in Texas, and the 14th-largest
district in the nation.12 The district serves approximately 160,000 students in pre-kindergarten
through the 12th grade in 224 schools. Of these, approximately 10,000 are pre-kindergarten
students in 132 preschools. The Dallas ISD pre-kindergarten serves a diverse and economically
disadvantaged student population. The main eligibility criteria for pre-kindergarten enrollment are

that children are unable to speak and comprehend the English language or that children are eligible
to participate in the National School Lunch Program. The preschool student body consists of
approximately 67 percent Hispanic, 28 percent black, and 2 percent white students, with the
remaining 3 percent including Asian, American Indian, and mixed-race students. Eighty percent
of pre-kindergarten students are economically disadvantaged.13
To recruit parents for the study, we built on the district’s existing school registration
process for pre-kindergarten enrollment. When parents registered their children for preschool – a
process that all parents must go through – they were invited to receive text messages and participate
in the study. A study participation form, which included active consent and was vetted by the
district, was available in both English and Spanish and was included in the district’s preschool
registration packet. After enrolling in the study, parents were able to receive texts in English or
Spanish. Parents could choose to opt out of their program at any time during the school year.14

Data and Descriptive Statistics

A.

Data Sources
In this study, we use information about the children, their parents, and their teachers.

Parental information comes from three main sources. First, we obtained preferred texting language,
age, and highest educational attainment from our enrollment forms. Second, we gathered opt out
information from our texting platform, EZtexting.com. Parents were able to opt out by replying
“Stop” or similar words to any text message. We use this opt out information as a measure of

13
Numbers are based on official DISD enrollment statistics as of 12/15/2017. See
https://mydata.dallasisd.org/SL/SD/ENROLLMENT/Enrollment.jsp for more information.
14
In prior work, we found that nearly 90 percent of economically disadvantaged families had unlimited text messaging
plans (York et al. (2017)).

12

parents’ overall experience of the texting program. Third, we surveyed parents after the texting
intervention ended at the end of the school year. We collected measures of parent-child
engagement, such as reading and literacy activities, and overall satisfaction with the texting
program. Parents were invited to participate in the survey by text, email, and regular mail during
the months of August through September 2016. We offered parents 20 dollars for completing the
survey. Ultimately 664 parents did so. For our analysis, we only consider the 648 parents who
answered all questions, a response rate of only 18.6 percent. Though the survey response rate is
low, the treatment status did not affect survey participation (see attrition analysis in Section IV).
Parents who did not answer the survey are on average less educated and older, and they are less
likely to be black and more likely to be Hispanic.15
The parent survey included four series of questions. The first addressed the parents’
experience with the texting program. For instance, the survey asked if parents received and read
the texts, and if parents used the information and found it helpful. It also asked if parents would
have liked to have received more or less information. The second series of questions asked about
parents’ confidence in supporting their child’s school readiness skills in literacy and math skills
and in improving their child’s behavior.16 The third series of questions assessed the frequency of
activities when reading a book to their child such as letting the child turn the pages, talking about
pictures, asking questions, and underlining words with the finger. The fourth series of questions
assessed the frequency of reading related activities, including among others helping the child to
write her name, practicing word sounds, and helping to learn more words.

15

Results are available upon request.
Studies have suggested that literacy-only curriculum may both increase children’s literacy skills and enable them to
more readily acquire math skills (e.g., Purpura, Hume, Sims, and Lonigan, 2011). Thus, we also asked parents about
supporting their child’s math skills.
16

13

The child information comes from the Dallas ISD administrative student records. These
data include demographic information, such as age, gender, race and ethnicity, and an indicator
for low socio-economic status.17 The data also include our main child literacy outcome measure,
the Circle Assessment System (hereafter referred to as Circle). Circle is a one-on-one literacy
assessment that takes less than ten minutes per child to complete. All children in this study were
assessed with either the English- or Spanish-language version of Circle.18 Circle assesses language
and literacy skills along three distinct dimensions: rapid letter naming, rapid vocabulary naming,
phonological awareness. Specifically, the rapid letter naming task measures a child’s alphabet
knowledge (a one-minute timed assessment task); the rapid vocabulary naming task evaluates a
child’s ability to name common objects (a one-minute timed assessment task); and the
phonological awareness task assesses a child’s understanding of sound (approximately five
minutes).19 The phonological awareness is a sum of the following four subtasks:20 rhyming (i.e.,
the ability to distinguish if two words rhyme when spoken), alliteration (i.e., the ability to indicate
same beginning sound(s) between two or more words), syllabication (i.e., the ability to separate a
word into parts), and onset-rime (i.e., the ability to blend two parts of a word together when
segmented between the beginning consonant(s) and the rest of the word). For Spanish speakers,
the phonological awareness assessment only includes rhyming, alliteration, and syllabication.

17

Students are classified as economically disadvantaged if they qualify for free or reduced price lunches or if other
district specific criteria apply.
18
In the Circle-3 test sample 31.23 and 66.54 percent of students were assessed in the English- and Spanish-language
version of Circle, respectively. Small percentage of students (i.e., 2.23 percent; 65 students) in the Circle-3 test sample
was assessed in both languages. For students who had both English and Spanish test scores, the higher score was used.
19
In Appendix 1 we provide further details on each assessment, the administration of the assessments, and examples
of each assessment.
20
Only students who took the English-version of Circle were given the onset-rime task of the phonological awareness
test. For this reason, we only analyzed three of the four subtasks. We standardized the phonological awareness
composite score within language to take into account the fact that the English composite score includes onset-rime
task and the Spanish composite score does not.

14

The Circle assessment is administered three times during the school year: Circle-1 is
carried out in beginning of the year (September/October 2015), Circle-2 is carried out in the middle
of the year (January/February 2016), and Circle-3 is carried out at the end of the year (April/May
2016). Since the first assessment of Circle occurred before the intervention started, we use Circle1 results as covariates in all regression specifications. Our main set of child outcomes comes from
the third assessment (Circle-3), as parents and children had the most exposure to the program.21
The teacher information also comes from the Dallas ISD administrative data. These data
include teachers’ gender, race/ethnicity, experience in years, and the number of hours they were
absent in the school year. For each child, we use mean characteristics of all of their teachers during
the school year.

Descriptive Statistics
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics on the sample of parents represented in the

randomization sample (N=3,473), Circle-3 test sample (N=2,920), and parent survey sample
(N=648) by children, parental, and teacher characteristics. As shown in the first column of Table
1, about 11 percent of children in the randomization sample are black, 85 percent are Hispanic,
and 2 percent are Asian and white, respectively, and the majority of the sample is of low
socioeconomic status (95 percent). The average fall age of children in this sample is 4.7 years. The
demographic composition of population of four year olds in the Dallas ISD is similar the
randomization sample.

We launched in the Dallas ISD on November 16, 2015 and the intervention ended on June 24, 2016.

Also shown in Table 1 are the child’s pre-intervention Circle-1 raw test scores. Children,
on average, name 4.8 letters in one minute, identify 10.3 objects in one minute, and get 10.1 items
correct in the phonetic awareness assessment. To put these tests into context: the maximum score
a child can achieve in rapid letter naming is 52 letters (i.e., 26 lower-case and 26 upper-case letters
in the alphabet);22 the maximum score a child can achieve in rapid vocabulary naming is 55 words;
and the maximum composite score a child can achieve in phonological awareness is 28 in total
across all four subtasks (i.e., nine in rhyming, seven in alliteration, seven in syllabication, and five
in onset-rime). Also, according to the CIRCLE’s technical manual a child from the ages of 4 and
less than 4.5 as of September 1st should be able to name eight letters in one minute, identify 16
objects in one minute, and get 11 items correct in the phonetic awareness assessment at the
beginning of the school year. At the beginning of the intervention, our analytical sample of
preschoolers (four year olds) had literacy skills equivalent to average three year old children.23
Regarding parental characteristics (shown in panel B), 30 percent have less than a high
school degree, 26 percent have a high school degree, and 22 percent have some college or higher.
The average fall age of parents in this sample is 31.2 years. About two-thirds of parents, 64 percent,
chose to receive texts in Spanish, while 36 percent chose English.
As for average teacher characteristics (shown in panel C), most teachers are female (76
percent), and the average experience is 8.4 years in the district. The racial and ethnic teacher
composition in the district differs that of the student population: 19 percent are black and 46
percent are Hispanic, but a higher percentage of teachers were white (32 percent) compared to the

22
The Spanish alphabet has 27 letters, thus, the maximum score a child can achieve is 54 letters (i.e., 27 lower-case
and 27 upper-case letters).
23
A child older than 3.5 but younger than 4 as of September 1st should be able to name 7 letters in one minute, identify
10 objects in one minute, and get 10 items correct in the phonetic awareness assessment.

characteristics shows similar characteristics by most of these covariates.

Empirical Strategy

A.

Estimating Treatment Effects
We estimate the treatment effects of one specific activity in the Tip program and of two

additional activities in the FTTTG program in comparison to the original texting program, FTG,
with the following model specification:
∙
where

∙

∙

is the outcome of interest of parent (or child)

in pre-school site . The main parent

outcomes are survey measures of parent engagement and program experience, and opt out of the
program. The child outcomes are the Circle-3 literacy test scores, standardized within testing
language (English or Spanish) to have standard deviation one and mean zero. The variables
and

are binary indicators of whether a parent received only one “TIP” message with one

specific activity per week or the “FACT”, “TIP” , “TIP” , “TIP” , and “GROWTH” messages per
week, respectively, in comparison to receiving the original program (omitted category in all
regression specifications) with a “FACT”, “TIP”, and “GROWTH” texts message.

is a vector

of covariates that includes child characteristics (i.e., age, gender, race/ethnicity, low-SES status,
and pre-intervention Circle-1 test scores), parental characteristics (i.e., age and highest educational
attainment), and lastly, teacher characteristics (i.e., gender, race/ethnicity, years of experience, and
hours absent in school year).

are pre-school site fixed effects and

is a parent-level (or child-

level) error-term. Standard errors are clustered at the pre-school site level. The coefficients of

17

interest are

and

as they measure the causal effects of receiving Tip or FTTTG programs in

comparison to original texting intervention, the FTG program. To explore treatment effect
heterogeneity, we also estimate the above model specification in quarters of the child’s preintervention Circle-1 test.

B.

Randomization Checks
In any randomized experiment the only difference that should exist among the

experimental groups is, in expectation, the treatment status itself. Any systematic difference of
observed and unobserved characteristics between the treatment groups could produce biased
estimates of the treatment effects.
To check whether the randomization was successful based on observed characteristics, we
estimate a series of pre-school site fixed effects models in order to evaluate covariate balance.
These fixed effects models take the following functional form:
∙

∙

We regress the child, parent, and teacher characteristics,

.
, on the

indicators. If the randomization was successful, then the coefficients

and

treatment
and

should be

statistically insignificant.
Table 2 presents the randomization checks for all three samples previously shown in Table
1, and illustrates little covariate imbalance. Specifically, of the 62 point estimates in each sample,
only six estimates of the randomization sample are statistically significant at the ten percent level
or less; only six estimates of the Circle-3 test sample are statistically significant at the ten percent
level or less; and only four estimates of the parent survey sample are statistically significant at the
ten percent level or less. These numbers are largely what we would expect due to chance.
18

Furthermore, as shown at the bottom of Table 2 (panel C, last row), we cannot reject the null
hypothesis that the coefficients are jointly equal to zero in each of the three samples. Nonetheless,
in all regression analyses, we include the full set of covariates.

C.

Attrition Analysis
We analyze attrition in both the child outcome data (i.e., Circle-3 test sample) and parent

outcome data (i.e., parent survey sample) by testing whether attrition differs by treatment status.
If the attrition rate of parents who received the Tip or FTTTG programs systematically differ to
that of the comparison group (i.e., FTG program) in a way that is related to our study outcomes,
then our treatment effects would be biased. For instance, if lower performing children whose
parents received the Tip program leave the school district at a higher rate than children whose
parents received the FTG program, the treatment effects are likely biased upward.
Thus, to check for selective attrition from the Circle-3 test sample and parent survey
sample, we estimate the following pre-school site fixed effect models:
∙
where

∙

∙

is a binary indicator that equals one (and zero otherwise) if a child (or parent) does not

appear in the Circle-3 test sample or parent survey sample.24 We also control for child, parent, and
teacher characteristics, and pre-school site fixed effects.
Table 3 reports the results for the attrition analysis. The first row shows that attrition in the
Circle-3 test sample overall does not differ by treatment status (panel A). Both coefficients are
close to zero and are statistically insignificant. However, when examining attrition by quarters of

24

Children are included in the Circle-3 test sample if they have test scores in both Circle-1 and Circle-3 assessments.

19

Circle-1 literacy scores, the coefficients for the Tip treatment are marginally statistically
significant for the two middle quarters. In the second quarter, the likelihood of missing Circle-3
literacy scores is 4.4 percentage points higher than for those who received the original program.
In the third quarter, this probability is 4.7 percentage points lower. The main concern here is
whether the treatment status affects attrition. Taking a closer look at these two middle quarters,
the effect on the attrition pattern does not appear systematic and may simply be due to noise. That
said, given this differential attrition in these two quarters, we assess the robustness of our main
results with a bounding analysis in Section V. Our results remain largely unchanged. Panel B of
Table 3 shows that neither treatment group is affected by selective attrition into the parent survey.
All reported estimates are statistically insignificant.

V.

Main Results

A.

Results on Parental Program Experience and Engagement
We find evidence that the experience of some parents was tempered by increasing the

number of text messages that they received per week. As shown in Table 4 (panel A), for the full
sample, parents who received the Tip program were 2 percentage points less likely to opt out of
the program compared to those receiving the original program, FTG. In other words, a 40 percent
decline in opting out of the intervention over the base mean opt out of 5 percent in the FTG
program. In line with these results, parents who received the FTTTG program were about 2.9
percentage points more likely to opt out compared to those receiving the original program (a 58
percent increase in opting out over the base mean opt out of 5 percent in the FTG program).
Furthermore, these results are driven mostly by parents whose children are in the lowest quarter of
their pre-intervention literacy assessment. These parents were 4.4 percentage points less likely to
20

opt out if they were in the Tip program, and 4.9 percentage points more likely to opt out of the
FTTTG program compared to the FTP program.
Panel B shows supporting evidence for the opt out results based on the parent survey data.
In the survey, we asked parents about their overall experience with the text messages (for instance,
how helpful the texts were to them, if they thought they received too few or too many texts, etc.).25
For the most part, parent’s responses to these questions align with the parental opt out data. For
instance, the FTTTG program decreased the frequency of parents reading the texts by 0.25 SDs
compared to the original texting program. Interestingly, parents who received only the Tip program
also decreased the frequency of reading the texts by 0.19 SDs compared to the original texting
program. These parents also reported that the “ideal” number of texts should be lower than parents
in the original program. Overall, while some parents opted out more with three texts than with one
texts, parents reported that they like three texts per week the best. Five texts per week increased
opt out and was not preferred to three texts per week in the survey reports.
We further find evidence of the benefits of three texts relative to one or five when looking
at parent-reported interactions with their child. Table 5 shows the treatment effects on parent’s
reading and literacy activities, and parental understanding of child development based on the
parent survey.26 As shown across all panels of Table 5, parents in the Tip program decreased the

25

Parents could answer the questions: “When you received Ready4K texts, did you READ them?” and “Did you USE
the information in Ready4K texts?” these two questions were on a four point Likert scale (never, sometimes, most of
the time, always), the question “How HELPFUL was the information in Ready4K texts?” was on a four point Likert
scale (not helpful, a little helpful, helpful, very helpful), the question “Was the NUMBER of Ready4K texts that you
received each week not enough, too many or just right?” was on a three point Likert scale (not enough, too many, just
right), and the question “To what extent would you DISCOURAGE or RECOMMEND Ready4K texts to other
parents?” was on a three point Likert scale (discourage, neither discourage nor recommend, recommend). Answers
are standardized to have mean zero and standard deviation one.
26
In Panel A, parents could answer the question: “When you READ to your child, HOW OFTEN do you do the
following things?” this question was on a four point Likert scale (never, sometimes, often, always). In Panel B, parents
were asked to answer: “Last week, HOW MANY TIMES did you do each of the following READING RELATED

21

frequency by which they did literacy activities with their child. For example, parents were
significantly less likely to report: talking about the pictures in a book; asking their child questions
about what is happening in the story; underlining words with their finger as they read to their child;
practicing word sounds with their child (e.g., milk starts with “mmm”); and helping their child
learn new words. The size of these effects ranges from approximately 0.21 to 0.36 SDs. Parents in
the Tip program also indicated a significantly lower confidence in how to develop their child’s
literacy skills compared to the original program. The FTTTG program greatly decreased selfreported frequency by which parents underline words as they read (0.30 SDs) and read to their
child (0.19 SDs). All together, these survey results suggest that providing only one actionable
activity decreases self-reported parental reading and literacy activities, and providing additional
actionable activities does so to a lesser extent.

B.

Results on Child’s Reading and Literacy Development
Although parents who received the Tip program were less likely to opt out of the texting

intervention, they were less likely to engage in parent-child reading and literacy activities and to
understand their child’s literacy development. These two effects on parent behavior could have an
offsetting impact on their child’s literacy development. On the one hand, parents opting to stay in
the texting intervention because they find the one tip per week helpful could lead to learning gains
for their child. On the other hand, parents’ reduced engagement with their child relative to the FTG
program because of the missing buy-in (i.e., FACT text) and reinforcement (i.e., GROWTH text)

activities with your child?” this questions was on a four point Likert scale (not at all, once or twice, 3 or 4 times, more
than 4 times). In Panel C, parents could answer the question: “How much do you AGREE with each of the following
statements? I know what I can do to help my child develop/improve … ?” this questions was on a four point Likert
scale (strongly disagree, disagree, agree, strongly agree). All answers were standardized to have mean zero and
standard deviation one.

22

could negatively affect their child’s development. Parents in the FTTTG program were more likely
to opt out of the intervention and less likely to engage in reading and literacy activities. In this
case, we would expect the changes in these behaviors if anything to reduce their child’s literacy
development compared to the original program.
Table 6 reports the treatment effects on children’s literacy skill development. While we
find, on average, no treatment effects of either program compared to the FTG program (all
coefficients are close to zero and statistically insignificant) on children’s Circle-3 test, the effect
of the texting programs is clearly dependent on the pre-intervention literacy skill distribution of
the child. We find that the Tip program substantially decreased literacy skills for low performing
children, while children whose parents received the FTTTG program did not significantly differ
from those in the original program. In particular, for children in the lowest quarter of the pretreatment Circle-1 literacy assessment, providing parents the Tip program decreased children’s
literacy scores by 0.15 SDs compared to the original program. Point estimates suggest that the
literacy scores of children in next higher two quarters increased by approximately 0.11 to 0.12 SDs
compared to the original texting program, but these effects are only marginally significant.
Pooling these two middle quarters, we find a statistically significant effect of 0.11 SDs (p < 0.001).
The effect of the FTTTG program are also close to zero and statistically insignificant across all
quarters of Circle-1 literacy scores.
The effects on the overall literacy scores reported in Table 6 are most strongly driven by
effects on children’s rapid vocabulary naming and phonological awareness. Table 7 shows
treatment effects of the Tip and FTTTG programs for the various sub-tasks of Circle-3 language
and literacy skills assessment test: (1) rapid letter naming, (2) rapid vocabulary, and (3)
phonological awareness. Phonological awareness in turn can further be disaggregated into: (4)
23

rhyming, (5) alliteration, and (6) syllabication. We report estimates across quarters of the Circle-1
literacy scores. Estimates for the full sample are close to zero and statistically insignificant.27 The
negative treatment effects of the Tip program for children in the lowest quarter are driven by a
significant decrease in phonological awareness (-0.27 SDs). In particular, rhyming and
syllabication decreased by 0.32 and 0.20 SDs, respectively, compared to children’s test scores
whose parents received the original texting program, FTG program. The remainder of sub-tasks
(i.e., rapid letter naming, rapid vocabulary naming, and alliteration) in the lowest quarter have
negative, but small and statistically insignificant point estimates. The literacy gains of children in
the higher two middle quarters are driven by rapid vocabulary naming (0.14 SDs), alliteration (0.20
SDs), and syllabication (0.19 SDs). The effects of the FTTTG program on the subtasks are mostly
statistically insignificant with the exception of phonological awareness, which is lower for children
in the lowest quarter compared to the original program (-0.20 SDs), and this effect appears to be
mostly driven by the effect on rhyming and syllabication (-0.22 to -0.23 SDs).

C.

Robustness Checks
In order to further probe our main results, in this section we conduct two robustness checks.

First, we provide evidence that different model specifications do not change our results. If
randomization is successful, observable and unobservable parent and child characteristics should
not differ in expectations between treatment groups. As a result, the inclusion of different
covariates in the models should not substantially change the estimated coefficients. All results
reported in Tables 4 through 7 are controlling for child, parent, and teacher covariates, as well as

27

These results are available on request.

24

pre-school site fixed effects. Table 8 reports again the estimates for the overall child literacy
development from Table 6 (shown in model 1), estimates excluding the Circle-1 literacy scores
from the set of covariates (shown in model 2), and estimates only conditional on pre-school site
fixed effects (shown in model 3). Across all model specifications, the results are very similar.
Second, we assess the robustness of our results to the systematic attrition differences across
programs within quarters of the baseline literacy skill distribution. If literacy development of
children without Circle-3 test scores differs on average from those children with test scores, our
results would be biased. To understand the scope of this problem, we estimate the effects of the
programs on the overall literacy score including children with missing scores. We estimate nine
different regressions for the full sample and within the second and third quarters – those that
exhibited differential attrition rates. In each regression, we impute missing scores with a different
percentile (1st to 9th percentile) of the observed distribution in the respective sample. All models
include site fixed effects and the full set of covariates.
Figure 1 shows these results. The dotted lines correspond to the baseline effects of the Tip
(light grey) and FTTTG (dark grey) programs, respectively, not including children with missing
scores. The solid blue and dashed red lines correspond to the effects with missing scores imputed
at a given percentile of the observed distribution in the respective sample. As shown in the top
panel, the results for the Tip and FTTTG programs in the full sample are robust, but this is not
surprising given that we did not find a significant impact of the treatments on attrition for these
samples. However, the estimated effects of the Tip program on the literacy score in the second and
third quarter of the baseline skill distribution are not as robust. Recall, that the Tip program
appeared to have increased the likelihood of missing any Cirlce-3 scores by 4.4 percentage points
in the second quarter and decreased the likelihood by 4.7 percentage points in the third quarter. In
25

the second quarter, the estimated effect of the Tip program increases assuming higher Circle-3
literacy scores for those children with missing values. When we assign all missing values to have
scores at the 5th percentile, the estimates are significantly different from zero. Conversely, in the
third quarter, the estimates decrease assuming higher Circle-3 literacy scores. The estimates are
only significant at the first three percentiles.

VI.

Conclusion
This study analyzes content and frequency of a text messaging program aimed at

supporting parental engagement in the literacy development of preschoolers. Our analysis provides
three main takeaways. First, parents are more likely to opt out of the intervention as the frequencies
of texts increases. This pattern is particularly strong for parents of the lowest performing children.
Second, the original program results in greater parent satisfaction and parental engagement in
reading and literacy activities than either the Tip or the FTTTG programs. Parents who received
only one text message per week were the least likely to engage in literacy building activities or to
report knowing what to do to build literacy skills. Third, we find no difference in child literacy
assessment results by treatment status for the full sample, but for children in the lowest quarter of
baseline skills, the original program resulted in greater learning than the Tip program. For children
in the middle half of the distribution, the Tip program may have resulted in the greater learning.
Overall our findings suggest that text messaging programs can include too little and too
much information. The original program of three texts per week was more effective at changing
parent-reported behaviors and increasing learning for lower achieving children than the Tip
program. York et al. (in press) estimated that the original program in comparison to a placebo
program increased literacy development of children below the median of the base line skill
26

distribution by 0.31 SDs. We find that a one “TIP” per week in comparison to the original program
increases the literacy development of children in the lowest quarter of the base line skill
distribution by 0.15 SDs. Taken at face value, these two results suggest that one activity alone may
still increase child literacy development by about 0.16 SDs for lower performing children
compared to no treatment. No group benefited from five texts per week in the FTTTG program
relative to fewer texts. Moreover, an increased number of texts led to greater program attrition and
lower parental engagement.
For parenting programs, as well as for other interventions aimed at changing adult
behavior, it is easy to assume that more is better. Recent programs – some but not all using textmessaging to remind and provide information – have shown the light-touch interventions can have
large effects, effects that are, in many cases, quite a bit larger than more intensive traditional
program. These light-touch programs have often provided easy-to-implement suggestions over
extended periods of time. Yet even in these light-touch programs, the balance between too much
and too little can be quite salient. This study is the first that we know of to directly test quantity,
particularly with a population of low-income adults. The results point clearly to the possibility of
too much, even for information that recipients welcome and for aimed goals that they prioritize.
For this population, five contacts per week was simply too much for parents and showed no benefit
for children. At the lower levels, the differences between one and three were less clear, with parents
favoring three but only the lowest performing children benefiting from the additional contacts.

Appendix 1.
CIRCLE Assessment System Subtest Descriptions: Language and Literacy Skills
A.

Rapid Letter Naming

This assessment is given to evaluate a student’s ability to identify letters of the alphabet.
Directions: Child is given a total of 60 seconds to identify letters that appear on the screen. The
student must respond within 3 seconds. If 3 seconds elapse without a response the item is
automatically scored as incorrect. A response should be recorded if the child correctly names the
letter, if the child says: “I don’t know”, or if the child provides the incorrect response.
Time to Administer: 1 minute per child
B.

Rapid Vocabulary Naming

The Rapid Vocabulary Naming subtest attempts to gain insight into a child’s expressive
vocabulary skills.
Directions: Child is given a total of 60 seconds to identify pictures as they appear on the screen.
There are different pictures for each wave of the assessment. The Rapid Vocabulary Naming
assessment includes 2 untimed warm-up items. The teacher conducts a practice session with the
warmup items and give feedback for both practice items:
Correct response: “Good job.”
Incorrect response: “That was a good try, but this is a ball. Let’s try some more. You say ‘ball.’
After a picture appears on the screen, the student must respond within 3 seconds. If 3 seconds
elapse without a response the item is automatically scored as incorrect. A response should be
recorded if the child correctly names the letter, if the child says: “I don’t know”, or if the child
provides the incorrect response.
Time to Administer: 1 minute per child
C.
Phonological Awareness
This measure is used to assess a child’s understanding of sound in his/her language.
There are four subtests in the Phonological Awareness assessment:
1) Rhyming 1:

Ability to distinguish if two words rhyme when spoken.

2) Alliteration:

Ability to give two or more words that have the same sound(s) at the beginning of
the words.

3) Syllabication:

Ability to separate a word into its parts.

4) Onset-Rime:

Ability to blend two parts of a word together when segmented between the
beginning consonant(s) and the rest of the word.

General Instructions: The teacher allows a 5 second wait time for the student to respond. Any time
longer than 5 seconds is considered a no response. All of the subtests contained within the
32

Phonological Awareness (PA) subtest include a sample item. This is an auditory assessment and
students do not see the teachers screen.
Approximate Time to Administer: 5 minutes per child
1)
Rhyming 1
The Rhyming 1 subtest of the PA subtest contains 9 test items that evaluate whether a child can
identify whether or not two words rhyme. For the 2015-16 year, these 9 test items were: housemouse, make-cake, girl-dog, pig-puppy, jump-pump, in-down, sun-sleep, night-light, and moptop.
Directions: The child repeats each word pair prior to indicating if the words are the same or not.
After the teacher records the child’s response.
2)
Alliteration
The Alliteration subtest is another task that asks children to provide a “yes” or “no” answer to
whether or not a pair of words start with the same sound. This subtest contains a sample item and
7 test items. For the 2015-16 year, these 7 test items were: nut-nail, sock-sail, foot-tie, rain-mouse,
boat-box, log-light, and kind-glue.
Directions: The child repeats each word pair prior to indicating if the words are the same or not.
After the teacher records the child’s response.
3)
Syllabication
In the Syllabication subtest, children are asked to demonstrate knowledge of how words can be
broken down into syllables. There are 7 test items, as well as a sample item. For the 2015-16 year,
these 7 test items were: big, ball, wagon, hat, water, candy, and banana.
Directions: The teacher will say a word and clap the word parts and ask the child to say how many
parts he/she hears in the word.
4)
Onset-Rime
Onset-Rime subtest of the PA subtest includes a sample item and 5 test items. This subtest
evaluates one of the key components of phonological processing (i.e., blending) within single
syllable words. For the 2015-16 year, these 5 test items were: hat, man, dad, hot, and pig.
Directions: The teacher breaks up a word into sounds. The child repeats the parts and says the
word. The teacher then records whether the child’s response was correct or incorrect.

race/ethnicity, low-SES status, and Circle-1 test scores), parental characteristics (age and highest
educational attainment), teacher characteristics (gender, race/ethnicity, years of experience, and
hours of absence used), and pre-school site fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the preschool site level. The omitted reference group in all regressions is the original texting program of
3 texts per week (i.e., FTG program). aQuarters are based on student's Circle-1 tests prior to the
intervention. Statistical significance levels: *p<0.10; **p<0.05; ***p<0.01.
