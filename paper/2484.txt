The Basic Analytics of Moral Hazard

ABSTRACT

This

paper develcçs the basic analytica of noral hazard, for the

two-a.itcxzie case where either a fixed damage accident oirs or it does
riot. The analysis focuses on the relationship between the insurance

premium paid ar the insurance benefits received in the event of an
accident, ar is corducted in benefit-premium space. The central
massage of the paper is that even when the urd.erlyirg functions, the

expected utility function ard the function relatim the accident
prthability to accident-prevention effort, are extrQly well-behaved,
the irdifference curves ard feasibility set (the set of insurance
contracts which at least break even) are not—irdifference curves need
not be convex arxl feasibility sets never are; price-ard inccze-

consunption lines may be discontinucus; ard effort is not in general a
ircriotonic or continucus function of the paramaters of the insurance
policies provided.

Part I of this paper establishes these results, while Part II
curves ard the feasibility set profirdly affects the nature ard
discusses scm of their iirplications. The bad behavior of irdifference
existence of cxxpetitive &iuilibrium. We illustrate this, thcxzh we do
not provide a thorough analysis. We also show that cxir canonical nodel

of an insurance market with noral hazard can be reinterpreted to

provide a nodel of loans with bankruptcy, or of work incentives.

The Basic nalvtics of Moral Hazard

In the staixard (ArrcM-Debreu) carpetitive treatnnt of risk, the

states of nature, which occur with exogencxis probabilities, are
observable. Insurance cxntiient on the realized state entails lump-

siun transfers across states aixi therefore has no incentive or
substitution effects.

Moral hazard arises when neither the states of nature nor
irxiividuals' actions are observable to an insurer)- What is observable
is whether a particular accident has occurred. tJrxler these cor3itions,

there is no ucthanism by which the insurer can iixiuce the insured to

reveal either the state of nature or his level of precaution
truthfully. Thus, the insured-against events are accidents of varyir
drees of severity, cor.itional on neither the state of nature nor the
insured's actions. The provision of insurance against such events will
generally affect the iixiividual's incentives to take precautions2—
i.e., have substitution effects. There is therefore a tradeoff between
incentives ard risk-bearing. This is the noral hazard problan.
Moral hazard is pervasive in the econany. It occurs whenever risk

is present, iriiividuals are risk-averse, arKi "effort" is costly to
itcriitor. rd it arises not only in insurance markets, but also when
1this is the extreme fonn of noral hazard. Moral hazard probl

arise, thcugh they are diluted, when the states of nature ar/or
irK3.ividuals' actions are imperfectly observable (observable with noise).

2The provision of insurance therefore affects the probabilities of
the events. For this reason, we define noral hazard to arise when the
provision of insurance affects the probabilities of the insured-against
events.

insurance is provided by governments, thrc.igh social institutions, or
in principal-agent cx)ntracts.

This paper develops the basic analytics of ncral hazard.

The

analysis focuses on the relationship between the insurance premium paid

ar the insurance benefits received in the event of an accident.

We

derive the properties of the irxlifference curves ar of the feasibility
set, the set of insurance contracts which at least break even. The

central massage of the paper is that even when the ur1er1yir
functions, the expected utility function ar the relationship between

ef fort ax the accident prcabi1ity, are extremaly well-behaved, the
irdifference curves arxl feasibility sets are not—ir*.ifference curves
need not be convex ari feasibility sets never are; price- axx macmaconsumption lines may be discontinuous; arxl effort is not in general a

irriotonic or continuous function of the pararreters of the insurance
policies provided or of the prices of goods.

Part I of this paper establishes these results, while Part II
discusses sate of their iit,lications. We shc that our canonical nidel
of an insurance market can be reinterpreted to provide a imde1 of loans
with bankruptcy, or of work incentives. The properties that we uncover

here have profour implications for the nature arxl existence of
cctrpetitive equilibrium. We illustrate sare of these

ecause of space limitations, we provide a thorcigh analysis of

the nature ar existence of ccetitive equilibrium in a cipanion
paper (Arnott ani Stiglitz [1987a]).

Part I: Basic Analytics
1. The Wdel
Thra.ighout ncst of the paper we shall enploy the sinpiest model in
which moral hazard is present. Each irxIividual in the econciny engages

in a single activity that has two possible outxues, which we refer to
as "accident" arKi "no accident" .' The c*itxit of the econcany is a

consuirption good which is the only good in the ncany. n
ir1ividual 's level of outp.it (his consumption or inccsne in the absence
of insurance) depends on whether or not an accident occurs to him. The

probability of an individual havirg an accident is a function of his
accident-prevention effort,5 and different individuals' accident
probabilities are statistically iixleperdent. To isolate the ithencarena
arising fran moral hazard (fran those which would arise if there were

adverse selection as well) we assurre that individuals are identical.
Alternatively, we could assume that insurers can observe all the

relevant characteristics of the insured (except, of course, effort),
and interpret cur analysis as applying to a group with the sarre
characteristics.
Because they are risk-averse, individuals will want to insure
against the accident. We assuxte that whoever provides the insurance

4One nay instead interpret the two aitcares as "large damage

conditional on an accident occurrixg" and "nall damage conditional on
an accident occurring."

5Our analysis is sufficiently general that effort may be
interpreted variously as exertion, the tiit spent in accident-

prevention activity, the nature (unpleasantness) of the accidentprevention activity undertaken, and (for saxe utility functions) units
of the consumption good used up in accident prevention.

can serve whether the accident has occurred, bit neither the
urIerlyin states of nature nor irdividuals' effort levels—this is the
informational asynintty which gives rise to the ural hazard prthln.
Thus, insurance is provided against the accident. As iire insurance is
provided, the marginal private benefit to the inlividual of experdirg a

given level of effort on accident prevention falls; as a result, he
will teni to eqerd less effort which will increase the probability of
his havirg an accident.
We denote by Yo

ar

Yi consurrtion in the events no accident

ard accident, respectively. In the absence of insurance

y0=w

y1=w-d,

w is the no-accident out.it ard d the damage due to the
accident, so that w-d is the accident outpit. We characterize an
insurance policy in term of a net (of priuin) payout or benefit, a

where

which the inlividual receives in the event of accident, ard a premii,
an accident does not occur.6 Thus,

points in the paper, we shall asstm that the irdividual has a choice

different accident-prevention activity or technique.

the prc1abi1ity of
accident when nothir is done to prevent the accident.7 we ass.m that
< 1 —with no effort an accident need not occur.

At other points in the paper, we shall asstm that the ir1ividual
has a choice over a continuum of effort levels, we assi.nt that nre

effort always reduces the pr±ability of accident ar does so in a
continucus manner, and we cardinal ize effort in such a way that e=O

we note that the existence ar properties of

discontinuities in the price- ar incx*ne-consunption lines deper on
global rather than local properties of the utility ar probability-ofacxident functions. As a result, there açpear to be no simple,
primitive restrictions on these functions (except those whicth guarantee
that irxiifference curves are everywhere convex) which guarantee that

cxlicates the analytics; we focus here on two interestir qualitative
results which enrge—ef fort may not be nonotonic in the anint of
insurance, ard in the continuum of effort levels case effort may not be

a continuc*s function of the anint of insurance.
4.1 Non-nonotonic effort.

The first result is seen nostly easily within the context of the
discrete effort levels nodel. Here it is possible that vHo ar vL0
(defined as before, but noi with non-separable utility) intersect trore
than once, as shown in Figure 7. If this occurs, then the inlividual

will tploy one level of effort at both high ar low annts of
insurance ard the other level at internliate ancynts. The intuitive
rationale for this is that as the (ccnpensated) aircunt of insurance
provided increases, the marginal cost (disutility) of effort may fall
faster than the marginal benefit. The bouzxlary lines in a - space
between different activities can have a1nst any shape.
Insert Figure 7

4.2 Discontinucus effort.
We now show that with a continuum of effort levels, but a non-

separable utility function, effort may not be a continuis function of

the annt of insurance, even though the urderlyin utility ard
prthability-of -accident functions are "well-behaved."

is provided in rnott and Stiglitz (1987a). Here our aim is to use the

gecitriC and analytic tools developed thus far in the paper to
illuminate sans of the issues involved. To siiilify, we continue to
assuins separable utility.

The existence and properties of equilibrium are crucially
dependent on what information is available to insurance finns. There
are three itris of information of concern to an insurance finn when

insuring a client: i) whether or not the accident actually orred;
ii) the effort undertaken by the client to prevent the accident; and
iii) if effort is not observable, the client' s purchases of insurance

occurred.

With respect to the other iten of information, we treat only the

i) where a firm can costlessly observe its clients'
insurance purchases from other finns—we tern this the "observable
insurance purchases" case or simply the "observability" case; and ii)
where a finn cannot observe its clients' purchases from other firir,
the "unobservable insurance purchases" or "unobservability" case. This
information is relevant since in the fonrer case the firm can ration

two extmts:

its clients' purchases of insurance, whereas in the latter it cannot.

19H8itran [1979) considers the case in which firs can observe
their clients' effort with noise.
27

The existence ard prcerties of equilibrium also depen:1 on what
insurance contracts are der admissible. The set of admissible

contracts clearly deperds on what is cservable; if the quantity of
insurance pirchased at other firn is not cservable, then admissible
contracts cannot directly restrict the anøint prthased at other firms.

Stien it is feasible for firn8 to restrict the quantity of
insurance (in particular, if the quantity of insurance which an
jrxIividual buys is thservable), equilibrium will be characterized by
exclusive contracts, in which the irxuividual will ,irdiase all of his

insurance frm a sir1e provider. The equilibrium is at the point of
maxiimim utility on the feasibility set.

A zero profit price equilibrium, if it exists, must be at the
intersection of the zero profit locus and the price-consumption line.
Because the price-consumption line may jump across the zero profit

locus (recall section 3), a zero profit price eauilibrium may not
exist.
%hen the zero profit price eauilibrium exists, the level of effort
is zero with accidents which decrease or leave undiarx the mtrqinal
utility of incorr at each level of inccne. This follis frciim the fact

is that the irdifference curves be convex near E . 3.it we have

already seen, that urder cordition (ii), irdifference curves are
nonconvex in the neighborhood of the zero effort line,

ard that E is

on the zero effort line.
TWO further points should be noted. First, convexity of the
injifference curves near E does not ensure the existence of a zero
profit price equilibrium; to establish existence, a global analysis is
required. Secord, the non-existence of a zero profit price equilibrium
does not imply the non-existence of a price equilibrium. In Arnott ard

Stiglitz [1987a) we sh'i that a price equilibrium always exists, but
may entail zero insurance or positive profits.

7.3 Other uilibrium forms.
The fact that an insurance firm cannot observe insurance purchases

fran other firms does not itan that equilibrium must be a price
equilibrium. Since the insurance firm can observe its in sales of
insurance to an irxiividual, by insistir that the inlividual purchase a
large quantity, it can attempt to discourage the irdividual from
purchasir from other firms. We refer to equilibria in which fints
31

offer only quantity contracts as Q-equilibria, ar equilibria in which
sate finte offer price contracts arxi other quantity contracts as Bequilibria. In Arnott ar1 Stiglitz [1987a] we sh that Q-equilibria

contract which if of fere:1 would be xrdiase ar make a profit.
(The entry of this new contract would, hcever, result in other

The non-existence of

equilibrium

hinges

critically on the properties of the inccme-consurrtion lines.

To see this, assume that utility is separable arI eventiix3.eperxlent arxl consider the situation where there is a single
inc.iir,ent finn in the market which offers a quantity policy. When can

this be an equilibrium? If the incumbent's policy lies strictly inside

the feasibility set, there exists a small, supplemantaiy policy
(possibly with neqative insurance) which would be bought ar be
profitable. Thus, the incumbent's policy must lie on the ZPL . The
incumbent's policy must also lie on the price-consumption line.
Sur.cose, to the contrary, that the incumbent offers the policy G
which lies on the ZPL but not on the price consuiition line, as

illustrata in Figure 12. Then the surplelTentary policy GA will be
urchase (since A is bel the irdifference curve through G); an
32

if G is ll encxh, it will make a profit, because the effort at
A is aly slightly lcMer than at G bit the inplicit price of policy
GA is significantly higher than that of

G. S1i profits at A are

rative, while the suleitntaiy policy makes a profit, policy G
makes a loss. Thus, if iilibrium exists with a s]nle incuntent firm

offerir a quantity policy, the policy itust lie at the point of
intersection of the ZPL aiti the prioe-oonsuiiptiOfl line. If the priceconsunption line does not intersect the ZPL, such an equilibrium does

not exist.

If the price-consumption line does intersect the ZPL, it

does so at the point E23 , ani E may be a Q-equilibriurfl. A necessary

We have cast r presentation of the basic analytics of ural
hazard in the context of an explicit insurance market. In this
section, we wish to shcM that, with only a transformation of variables,

the analysis can be employed to cast light on issues in the principal

-agent literature. Thcigh the basic framawork of our analysis can be

applied in many contexts, the apprcriate uilibrium concept (the set
of admissible contracts) may well differ, because what is easily
observable in one market may not be so easily observable in another;
e.g., while it may be possible to restrict insurance p.ircthases from
other firs, it may not be possible to restrict employment with other
employers, or borrcMing from other creditors. In the discussion belcM,

we shci hc the iwdel can be reinterpreted to investigate sharecropping

ath credit contracts, but we do not consider the appropriate
iilibrium concept for each of the markets.
First, consider the contract between a risk-neutral larxilord ar a

risk-averse laborer (e.g., Stiglitz [1974]) in a competitive market.

with the laborer's effort. Moral hazard arises in the
contract because the landlord is unable to observe the laborer's
effort. Suppose, for purposes of exposition, that there are only two
output levels, with the probability of the higher output level
increasing in the laborer's effort. Let M and xL denote the high
increases

and 1cM c*.itpits respectively; R denote the landlord' s required average

effort. Then with the transfonnation of variables xH - R <-> w,

<>w3 , yL <->w-d+a , the prciDlexn is identical to the one
analyzed in the paper. The rental contract correspors to no
insurance, the wage contract to full insurance, ar sharecro.pirg to
partial insurance. Cur earlier result that, where exclusivity can be
enforced, partial insurance is typical in equilibrium, corresporxs to
the result in the current context that, where the lariilord can be sure

Secorxl, consider the starxard credit contract (e.g., Stiglitz ar
Weiss [1981)). The borrower obtains nney fran the ler1er ar uses

only this iney to finance a project.

The project is either

successful, yieldir return R , or unsuccessful, yie1dir a return of
zero. Moral hazard occurs because the probability of success depers
on the effort of the borrower, which is unobservable to the leixier.
The borrower starts with wealth W. We contrast the consequences of a
limited liability loan, with collateral C aixi interest rate i , with

an unlimited liability loan with rate of interest r

The

limited

liability loan increases consumption in the event that the project is

unsuccessful, bit because i >

event the project is successful. Thus, the limited liability loan is
essentially an unhilrLtted liability loan canbined with insurance. With

since doing so has adverse incentive effects.

Comments

If one believes, as we do, that incentive/itoral hazard problems
are pervasive in our economy, then it is important to construct itdels

exploring the existence ard properties of market equilibrium taking
these problems into account. It would be nice if we could simply

assi.m that the relevant functions had the necessary mathematical
37

properties to al1i a convenient borriir of concepts, itthcds, and
results frun starxard ccanpetitive equilibrium analysis.
Such,
unfortunately, does not turn ait to be the case.

The cbjective of this paper has been to develop the basic
analytics of the economics of itcral hazard. In spite of rnakir
standard convexity assumptions concernir the uix1erlyin utility
functions and technology, we have established that insurance
indifference curves are in general not convex and feasibility sets are

never convex. Effort may care discontinucsly as the paraneters of
the insurance contract are varied. Jnd even when strong conditions are
imposed on the forms of the underlying functions, price-consumption and

incat—consi.imption lines as well as dand curves may exhibit
discontinuities.
We have suggested that these "perversities" have sate profc*.irxl

implications for the existence and nature of equilibrium. For
instance, equilibrium will be characterized by exclusive contracts
entailing quantity rationing, when these are enforceable. When they

are not, other contract foni will be seen. When only price contracts
are offered, there may be no equilibrium with insurance in which firms

make zero profits. And when each finn rations the quantity of
insurance it sells, bot cannot chserve the quantities sold by other
fint, no equilibrium may exist.
Thc*igh we have ccLiched our analysis in terns of insurance markets,

the results have a direct bearing on all markets in which uncertainty
and incentive problens are both present; we illustrated this by shcing
hi the imxiel can be adapted to analyze labor and credit markets. The

Apeniix: A Brief Fview of the Earlier Literature
It is unusual to have a literature reviecz at the er of a paper.
Hever, this paper is self-contained, ar it is easier to explain here
what contrib.ition earlier papers made.
Pauly [1974] presented the basic two-c*.itcares moral hazard model.

He assun1 event-ilTlepelxlent utility ai convexity of irifference

curves in a- space. He identified ard explained the exclusive
contract equilibrium with servability ard the zero profits price
equilibrium with unobservability.

Helpian arxl Laffont [1975] broke new grourd in recognizir the
non—convexities to which moral hazard can give rise. For the n-cxitcare

case, they proved the existence of an exclusive contract equilibrium

with observability, ar*:1 of a zero profit price equilibrium with
unobservability when irdifference curves are convex in the analog to
a-/3

space.

They also presented an example de.rronstratirg the non-

existence of a zero profit price equilibrium with unobservability when
irdifference curves are non—convex. They did not, hciever, investigate

the non-existence probl further, or consider alternative equilibrium
concepts.

st of the subsequent literature has focussed on the principalagent prcbln with a continuum of c*itccais, on the assunptions of
convex irdifference curves ani continuity of effort in the paramaters
of the insurance contract.
Stiglitz (1983] provided an overview of the authors' preliminary

work on moral hazard ard introduced the analysis of price equilibria.
Heliwig (1983] argued that in the case of uncbservability of insurance

r*1rdases, there is a considerably larger set of cardidate equilibria

than the price equilibria; in particular, he csidered Q-equilibria
ar Sm fori of -equilibria for the case of two discrete effort
levels.
