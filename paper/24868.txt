ABSTRACT
How do regions acquire the knowledge they need to diversify their economic activities? How
does the migration of workers among firms and industries contribute to the diffusion of that
knowledge? Here we measure the industry, occupation, and location specific knowledge carried
by workers from one establishment to the next using a dataset summarizing the individual work
history for an entire country. We study pioneer firms–firms operating in an industry that was not
present in a region–because the success of pioneers is the basic unit of regional economic
diversification. We find that the growth and survival of pioneers increase significantly when their
first hires are workers with experience in a related industry, and with work experience in the same
location, but not with past experience in a related occupation. We compare these results with new
firms that are not pioneers and find that industry specific knowledge is significantly more
important for pioneer than non-pioneer firms. To address endogeneity we use Bartik instruments,
which leverage national fluctuations in the demand for an activity as shocks for local labor
supply. The instrumental variable estimates support the finding that industry related knowledge is
a predictor of the survival and growth of pioneer firms. These findings expand our understanding
of the micro-mechanisms underlying regional economic diversification events.

Abstract
How do regions acquire the knowledge they need to diversify their economic activities? How does the migration
of workers among firms and industries contribute to the diﬀusion of that knowledge? Here we measure the industry,
occupation, and location specific knowledge carried by workers from one establishment to the next using a dataset
summarizing the individual work history for an entire country. We study pioneer firms–firms operating in an
industry that was not present in a region–because the success of pioneers is the basic unit of regional economic
diversification. We find that the growth and survival of pioneers increase significantly when their first hires are
workers with experience in a related industry, and with work experience in the same location, but not with past
experience in a related occupation. We compare these results with new firms that are not pioneers and find
that industry specific knowledge is significantly more important for pioneer than non-pioneer firms. To address
endogeneity we use Bartik instruments, which leverage national fluctuations in the demand for an activity as
shocks for local labor supply. The instrumental variable estimates support the finding that industry related
knowledge is a predictor of the survival and growth of pioneer firms. These findings expand our understanding of
the micro-mechanisms underlying regional economic diversification events.

For decades, human capital has been recognized as an
important determinant of economic growth [2–10]. But
human capital is not just a worker’s formal schooling.
Workers acquire important skills, knowledge, and contacts at work. A forty-year-old worker brings, on average, more years of experience into a company than years
of schooling. This work experience, which is specific to
an industry, location, and occupation, should impact the
growth and survival of the activities where these workers
are involved.
The specificity of this knowledge pushes us to think
of human capital not only in terms of intensity, but in
terms of relatedness. Workers are not simply knowledgeable or skilled, but posses knowledge that is related to
specific activities, even to new activities that have never
before been present in a city or a country. In this paper,
we test what type of related knowledge is a more critical
ingredient in the success of new firms that lead to the
development of new industries. While there is a long literature measuring relatedness between products [11, 12],
industries [13, 14], technologies [15, 16], and even occupations [17], there is little work separating these relatedness
measures into multiple forms of human capital.
In this paper we decompose knowledge into a twodimensional representation, measuring how related the

Can developing countries and cities thrive through
their own entrepreneurship, or must they attract external investment? What are the factors that influence the
success of local ventures? Development depends on undertaking new tasks, which require knowledge. In this
paper, we estimate the impact of a worker’s knowledge
about an industry, occupation, and location in the survival of pioneer firms [1]: firms that start operating in a
region where their industry was not present.
Understanding the success of pioneer firms is key to
understanding the mechanisms behind industrial diversification. When a pioneer firms succeeds, the region where
this firm is now present will have successfully developed
a new industry. Here, we use a large administrative data
set with almost complete work histories for all the individual workers of a country, to measure the knowledge
carried by workers from their previous jobs into pioneer
firms. This dataset allows us to estimate the industry
specific knowledge, occupation specific knowledge, formal schooling, and knowledge about a location that each
worker brings into a pioneer firm. We use this fine grained
description to to test which type of knowledge matters
most for the growth and survival of pioneer firms, and
compare these results with new firms that are not pioneers; non-pioneer firms.

previous experience of a worker is to the industry and to
the occupation of their new job. A worker with abundant formal schooling and experience can be classified as
someone with little related experience if her work history
involves occupations and industries that are unrelated to
her current employment. Conversely, a worker with low
formal education can be classified as having high related
experience if she moves into an industry and occupation
that are related to the ones she has performed previously.
The dimensions of industry and occupation knowledge
are not necessarily tied together, since a worker can have
abundant experience in the occupation of her new job,
while having very little experience in a related industry.
We test the relative importance of these dimensions of
knowledge relatedness for the survival and growth of pioneer firms, and compare these results with their relative
importance for new firms that are not pioneers.
The idea that workers bring in knowledge into the
firms they participate in is an idea that has a long tradition in organizational learning. According to Herbert
Simon, organizations acquire knowledge either by the
learning of its members or by ingesting new members
[18]. Because pioneer firms do not start with members
that can learn, the knowledge this firm has needs to come
from the workers that it hires. We find that the survival
of pioneer firms increases significantly when their first
hires are people with industry specific knowledge, and
with experience in that location, but not with occupation specific knowledge. When comparing pioneers with
non-pioneers, we find that industry knowledge is significantly more important for pioneers than for non-pioneers,
and that occupation specific knowledge plays a relatively
more important role for non-pioneers.
There are some serious concerns relating to the endogeneity of starting a firm and of hiring. For instance,
firms with more social capital may be able to hire more
people from related industries. We cannot address these
concerns fully, but we can instrument for the number
of workers from a related industry available in a labor
market by looking at national industrial shifts using a
Bartik-style instrument [19]. Intuitively, the supply of
related workers is higher in areas with related local indus-

tries that have received adverse national or global shocks.
Our results on the importance of related knowledge are
similar when we use this instrument.
Together, our results show how work histories can be
used to measure the types of knowledge brought by workers into pioneer firms, and also, help uncover the relative
importance of industry and occupation specific knowledge in pioneering economic activities. These results tell
us that the success of the pioneering activities that promote diversification depends strongly on the move of local
workers with related knowledge into these new activities.

Data

We use Brazil’s RAIS (Annual Social Security Information Report) compiled by the Ministry of Labor and Employment (MET) of Brazil between 2002 and 2013. The
RAIS dataset uses the National Classification of Economic Activities (CNAE) for industries, and the Brazilian Occupations Classification (CBO) for occupations,
both revised by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and
Statistics (IBGE).
The RAIS dataset covers about 97% of the Brazilian
formal labor market [20] and contains fine-grained information about individual workers, including 5,570 municipalities (which are grouped by the IBGE into 558
microregions based on similar productive structure and
spatial interaction [21]), 501 occupations, and 284 industries for more than 30 million workers each year. Location information is provided at the discrete level of
each municipality, so a continuous treatment is not possible. Municipalities in Brazil are grouped by IBGE into
microregions based on similar productive structure and
spatial interaction [21]. Microregions are grouped into
137 mesoregions, which are grouped into 27 states, and
states are grouped into 5 macroregions. All the results
presented in the main text use the 3-digit level for industries, the 4-digit level for occupations, and microregions as the spatial unit of analysis. We use microregions
because they provide a more stringent criteria than municipalities for identifying pioneer firms; it is easier to
2

be the first firm to operate in an industry inside a small
municipality than inside a much larger microregion. The
supplementary information provides an alternative operational definition of pioneer firms based on microregions
plus their neighborhood.
One of the key characteristics of RAIS that make it
so useful for research is its granularity. The variables in
RAIS can be tracked down to the individual level, which
makes it the most important source of information on
the formal labor market dynamics in the country. The
classification of industries went through a major revision
between 2005 and 2006, which we solve by splitting the
analysis into before and after 2006.
Unfortunately, a firm that does not declare RAIS in a
particular year may not be necessarily “dead,” but just
facing economic problems that make it rational not to
pay taxes in that year or not to appear in any oﬃcial
control mechanism. In fact, many firms simply freeze
their activities awaiting better economic events. This
will lead us to underestimate the survival rate of firms,
although the exit from RAIS is surely itself an important
event. Because Brazilian legislation makes it relatively
easy to open a company, but relatively diﬃcult to close
one, many firms, especially small firms, often close without informing oﬃcial authorities, suggesting that the exit
from RAIS might be a better expression of a company’s
status than the oﬃcial closing of the firm. Studies conducted by the IBGE and MTE estimate that the rate of
underreport of firms’ death range from 14% to 20% of actually closed firms. To partially address these issues, we
will consider firms to be “dead” when they stop reporting
for at least two consecutive years. Despite these limitations, RAIS is the main source of information on the rate
of firm creation and destruction at the municipal level
[20]. In fact, the Central Registry of Firms (CEMPRE)
is built by IBGE and MTE based on the information
available in RAIS.

microregions between 2008 and 2012. During the observation period, Brazil produced roughly 500,000 new firms
a year, of which only about 3,000 to 4,000 (less than 1%)
were pioneers (Figure 1 D). For information about the
industries of pioneer firms see SI Appendix.
For pioneers, all their employees are new hires, so all
their initial stock of knowledge is connected to their initial workforce [18]. We base our measure of the knowledge brought in by a company’s new hire on the industry and the occupation of their previous job. Because
of the limited time range of the data, we consider only
jobs performed during the two years before the creation
of the pioneer firm. For instance, if a worker was a teller
(occupation) for a telecommunication company (industry), we assume that she brings two types of knowledge
to the pioneer firm: industry specific knowledge about
the telecommunication industry and occupation specific
knowledge about being a teller. Because diﬀerent industries and diﬀerent occupations vary along a continuum,
we abandon the view of industry and occupation knowledge as two binary variables [22]. We instead use a continuous approach building on the literature on relatedness. For example, the industries of shoe manufacturing and shirt manufacturing are diﬀerent industries, but
they are similar enough that a worker moving from shoe
manufacturing to shirt manufacturing should be regarded
as having some industry specific knowledge about shirt
manufacturing, relative to workers coming from a less related industry such as animal agriculture. The diagram
presented in Figure 2 A shows a pioneer firm made of
three workers: the first and third come from the same
occupation, but an unrelated industry, and the second
comes from a diﬀerent occupation, but a related industry.
To measure the relatedness between the industry of a
pioneer firm and the work histories of that firm’s workers we follow the literature on relatedness and use labor flows between pairs of industries at the national level
[13, 14]. Similarly, we measure relatedness for each pair
of occupations by looking at labor flows among occupations across the entire Brazilian economy. Unfortunately, the CBO classification has not been successfully
linked to skill compositions, so we cannot use direct measure of skill similarity. Logically, labor should flow freely
between industries and occupations that require similar
knowledge and not between industries and occupations
that require wildly diﬀerent knowledge. In fact, the relatedness measure based on labor mobility has been termed
“skill relatedness” by some authors [14, 23], because individuals changing jobs will likely remain in activities that
value the skills associated with their previous work.
Formally, we define the relatedness between industry
i and industry i′ as the residual of a regression explaining labor flows as a function of the size of industries and
their growth rates [14]. That is, we consider a pair of industries (occupations) to be related when the labor flows

Results

Pioneer firms are the basic units of economic diversification. Here, we define a pioneer firm as a firm that is new
(no record of it for at least 6 years), and that operates
in an industry that is new to its region (no record of the
industry in the region for at least two years before the
pioneer). For companies starting after 2006 we will add
the extra condition that they operate for at least two consecutive years, so as to filter out small short lived firms.
Because we need at least two years of work history of the
a pioneer’s first hires, and because CNAE went through
a major revision between 2005 and 2006, we analyze only
firms created either in 2005, or after 2008 (for more information see SI Appendix).

Figure 2: Work histories and networks of related activities. The diagram in A shows how individual work histories are used
to infer the knowledge brought into the pioneer firm by its first hires. The color of each worker represents their occupation,
while the color of the bounding box represents the industry. The yellow worker, for example, has experience as a cargo driver,
the same occupation he was hired to perform in the pioneer firm, but comes from a very unrelated industry. The light blue
worker has experience in a diﬀerent occupation, but in a related industry. B shows the network of related industries and C
shows the network of related occupations C. Node colors correspond to the highest level of the classification for occupations
and industries. This figure only shows the most important edges for each network, selected based on a trimming algorithm
that starts with the maximum spanning tree and then adds all edges above a threshold (see SI Appendix for details).

Relatedness among industries and among occupations
define two weighted undirected networks for each year.
Figures 2 B and C show the networks of related industries and occupations for 2008, after selecting the most
important edges for purpose of the visualization (see SI
Appendix for details). All of our analysis are conducted
with the full, time dependent, weighted networks.
Next, we use these measures of relatedness to create
indicators of the stock of related knowledge that workers bring into pioneer firms. For each pioneer firm, we
measure the amount of industry and occupation specific
knowledge brought into it by its workers by aggregating

industry knowledge: low, medium, and high. G is similar to F, but for diﬀerent levels of occupation knowledge. In both F
and G, low means the smallest observed value among pioneers, medium means the median of the observed values, and high
means the maximum observed value.

where sf,i′ is the fraction of workers in firm f with experience on industry i′ , and sf,o,o′ is the fraction of workers
in firm f performing occupation o with experience in occupation o′ .
These two aggregate variables quantify, respectively,
the industry and occupation specific knowledge that workers bring–based on their previous experience–into a pioneer firm f .
Figure 3 A shows a bi-variate histogram of the number
of pioneer firms starting with a certain stock of industry
and occupation specific knowledge. We note that the
median relatedness between a pair of industries or a pair
of occupations is about 0.4, so most pioneer firms hire
workers with a level of industry and occupation relatedness that is much higher than if they would be hiring
those workers at random. The best interpretation of this
fact is that the firms and workers recognize the importance of related knowledge and search and hire accordingly. When we study the histogram we observe that
pioneer firms tend to hire workers with occupation specific knowledge (top rows) but only with an intermediate
level of industry specific knowledge (middle columns).
Next, we look at the pioneer firms that survive. Figure 3 B shows a bi-variate histogram for the average three
year survival rate of pioneer firms. Surprisingly, the distribution of surviving firms is quite diﬀerent from the distribution of all pioneer firms. While pioneer firms tend
to hire workers with occupation specific knowledge, surviving pioneer firms tend to be those that hired workers

with high levels of industry specific knowledge (Figure 3
B). In fact, the three year survival rate of pioneer firms
increases from about 60% when workers do not have industry specific knowledge, to more than 85% when workers bring an average industrial relatedness of more than
Φf > 0.5 (Figure 3 E). Figure 3 D shows the growth in
employment of surviving pioneer firms. Here we see that
pioneer firms with high stocks of industry specific knowledge also grow much faster than those lacking industry
specific knowledge (Figure 3 E).
We formalize these results using multivariate regression analysis that predicts the three year survival rate
(t+3)
(t+3)
Sf,i,r and employment growth Gf,i,r of pioneer firm f ,
operating in industry i and region r. We use logistic regression to predict the three year survival rate and OLS
to predict growth. We focus on the three year survival
rate as a simple way to address right censoring of our
data (companies that outlive our observation period). If
we were to study survival at longer time periods using a
logistic model, we would have to shrink the pool of pioneer firms we can track (for alternative models see SI
Appendix).
Our models for survival and growth are a function of
the firm’s stock of industry specific knowledge (Φ), occupation specific knowledge (Ψ), average years of schooling
of its workers (edu), number of initial workers (n0 ), average wage (w), and local knowledge (ρ), which we define
as the fraction of workers with work experience in the
same region. In all of our models, the four knowledge

variables (Φ, Ψ, edu, ρ) are measured in units of standard
deviations from their respective means, to make their coeﬃcients more easily interpretable and comparable. Formally, our models take the form defined in Eqs. 7 and
8. The model in Eq. 7 is a logistic regression, and µi ,
λ(t) , and ηr from Eqs. 7 and 8 are industry, year, and
region fixed eﬀect, respectively. Because we control for
these fixed eﬀects, our model can capture the eﬀect of
diﬀerent types of human capital on firms’ survival and
growth, while controlling for time-invariant characteristics of industries and regions (such as the life cycle of
an industry), as well as nation wide trends. Moreover,
by adding the initial number of workers and the average
wage of each firm, we are controlling for size eﬀects and
for the other eﬀects regarding how attractive the jobs at
each firm are.
Table 1 presents the results for both models for pioneer firms, with Φ, Ψ, edu, and ρ measured in standard deviation units. Across all specifications the eﬀects
of industry specific knowledge (Φ) in the survival and
growth of firms remains strong, whereas the eﬀects of occupation specific knowledge (Ψ) and schooling (edu), are
weak when considered in isolation, and insignificant after
controlling for industry specific knowledge (Φ). Figure 3
C shows the average marginal eﬀects for model (6) from
Table 1. An increase in one unit of standard deviation of
industry knowledge leads to an average ∼ 5% increase in
the firm’s probability of survival.

Is industry knowledge important only for pioneer firms,
or for all new firms? Table 2 shows a comparison between pioneers and other non-pioneer new firms. The
industry knowledge coeﬃcient for non-pioneers is significantly lower than for pioneers (the interaction term
in model (3) is positive and significant), and for nonpioneers the occupation knowledge coeﬃcient remains
significant even when we consider it together with industry specific knowledge. Although we cannot reject
the view that general knowledge and occupation related
knowledge matter for both pioneers and for all firms, our
results show that their eﬀect is small compared to industry specific knowledge. In fact, the point estimate
for schooling is actually larger for pioneers than for all
new firms. These results suggest that industry specific
knowledge is more important for pioneer firms than for
new firms.
To explore the long-run impact of knowledge on survival, we focus on firms that started operating in 2005
and use the Cox Proportional Ratios model [24, 25] with a
similar specification as before (Eq. 7). Since we are only
using pioneers from one year, a fixed eﬀects model would
lead to model overspecification. Instead, we control for
region and firm characteristics as shown in Table 3. Figures 3 F and G show the predicted values for the survival
rate of pioneer firms according to model (5) from Table

Table 2: Survival and growth at the third year for pioneer firms (models 1 and 4), non-pioneer firms (models 2 and 5), and
for all new firms (models 3 and 6). The interaction between industry knowledge and a dummy for pioneers is positive and

or decline of industry i′ at the national level, as a supply shock that respectively decreases or increases the
availability of the workers with industry specific knowledge required by industries related to i′ . For instance,
if the manufacturing of cars and motorcycles are related
in terms of industry specific knowledge, a demand boom
in the car sector would cause a shortage of workers with
knowledge relevant to the manufacturing of motorcycles
in the regions where the car industries are growing. Consequently, we should expect a pioneer firm in the motorcycle industry to hire less workers with industry specific knowledge when the industries related to motorcycle manufacturing are experiencing national level booms.
This means the expected correlation, through this mechanism, between the Bartik instrument Bri and the number of workers with industry specific knowledge hired by
a pioneer firm Φf should be negative.
We define the industry knowledge Bartik shock on industry i in region r as:

The endogeneity of firm entry and hiring decisions
both challenge these results. Perhaps, more productive
firms just tend to hire related industry workers. Perhaps, occupation related knowledge does not matter, because firms only enter when they anticipate their ability to make up for any lack in occupation related skill.
We cannot address all endogeneity concerns, but we use
shocks to the supply of related human capital at the local
level as an instrument of hiring such workers.
Here, we construct a Bartik labor supply shock Bri
[19, 26, 27] using the demand shocks experienced by other
related industries. In other words, we use the growth

evidence suggest that knowledge is better understood
in terms of relatedness since workers diﬀer not only in
their total knowledge, but also in what this knowledge
is about. Here we have shown that general knowledge,

from related industries are more likely to have connections to clients, customers, and trustworthy workers, so
what they bring is not just their knowledge about the
industry, but also their knowledge of the social network
where the industry is embedded in [34, 35]. This form of
industry specific social capital, can be regarded as a subtype of industry specific knowledge or experience, and
also, should be reflected in the locations specific knowledge of a worker, which we find is a significant predictor
of the growth and survival of pioneer firms. Unfortunately, there are few data sources that can be used to
isolate the eﬀects of skills and location with the pure effects of social capital, so the eﬀects of embeddedness are
hard to identify.
These findings add to the literature studying diﬀerences between industry and occupation specific knowledge in other contexts [36, 37]. The industry knowledge brought by a firm’s manager, for example, has been
shown to be very important for the productivity of the
firm [22, 38]. In fact, a manager’s human capital has
been shown to be mainly industry specific [39], in the
sense that industry tenure provides a higher wage premium than occupational tenure. For other occupations
such as craftsmen, human capital has been shown to be
primarily occupation specific. Together with this body of
literature, our study suggests that the picture where a job
(an occupation for a given industry) is linked to a set of
skills only through the occupation might be incomplete.
There is growing evidence of the eﬀects of movement
of industry specific human capital on the development
of regions. History shows that the migration of skilled
workers encourages regional development of new industries. For example, in the sixteenth century, the region
around Antwerp was an industrial center for the textile
industry, until the anti-Protestant persecution in the late
sixteenth century triggered an exodus of Protestant workers. Many of those skilled workers moved to the northern
part of the Netherlands and helped develop new textile
industries in those cities [40, 41]. Similarly, other studies
using pioneer plants have revealed the importance of industry specific human capital [1], but have not compared
it with general knowledge or occupational knowledge.
Although our data is specific to Brazil, the great variation in income and industrialization level among Brazilian microregions suggests that our results might generalize. In fact, the richest Brazilian microregion had an average income per capita in 2013 of about USD 28k, which
was comparable to that of Spain, Italy, or South Korea;
while the poorest microregions had an average income of
about USD 5k, which is comparable to that of Paraguay,
Jamaica, or Algeria. Moreover, the vast geographic variation of wealth in Brazil makes it an interesting scenario
for studying industrial development, since it combines
the challenges of middle income countries with the data
reporting quality of high income countries. Finally, our
results emphasize that in order to fully understand the

importance of tacit knowledge for regional industrial diversification it is important to measure knowledge along
diﬀerent dimensions. The work history of individuals
may be the key to measure these diﬀerent types of knowledge.

Data description: region, industry, and occupation classifications

This section provides descriptive statistics of the spatial aggregation used in the main text, as well as the industry
and occupation classifications. More information and descriptive visualizations about Brazilian region, industries,
and occuaptions at at every level of aggregation can be found in http://legacy.dataviva.info.
We use Brazil’s RAIS (Annual Social Security Information Report) compiled by the Ministry of Labor and Employment (MET) of Brazil between 2002 and 2013. The RAIS dataset uses the National Classification of Economic
Activities (CNAE) for industries, and the Brazilian Occupations Classificatyon (CBO) for occupations, both revised
by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).
Information in RAIS is provided on a yearly basis and takes December 31 as the reference date. RAIS was created
to administer and control access to unemployment insurance and other pecuniary benefices to workers [1], therefore
workers have an incentive to report correctly. Moreover, in the years leading to 2007 the MTE instituted new control
and reporting mechanisms (such as fines, and declaration through the Internet) that created strong incentives for
firms to comply with the legislation that makes RAIS mandatory. To further improve data quality and ensure
compliance, the MTE cross-tabulates registry information from many other oﬃcial sources, such as the Ministry of
Social Security, the Federal Reserve and the Secretary of Federal Revenues (tax authority). As a consequence, MTE
estimates that RAIS is annually declared by 98% to 99% of oﬃcially existing firms [1].

1.1

Microregions

Brazil is divided into 27 states, which are divided into 558 microregions, which are divided into 5570 municipalities.
The revision we use here dates back to 1990. We focus on microregions because they span two main indicators where
selected to identify microregions: productive structure and spatial interaction [2]. The former implies the analysis
of the primary productive structure based on the use of land for agriculture, structure of establishments, productive
relationships, technological level and use of capital, and the degree of diversification of farming. The definition relied
on data from diﬀerent sourced, most of them generated between 1980 and 1990.
There are a total of 5,559 municipalities that stay throughout the whole period, and 558 microregions. Figure
1-A shows Brazil divided into microregions, and Figure 1-B shows the state of Sao Paulo divided into municipalities.
Table 1 provides basic statistics for properties of both municipalities and microregions, and Figure 2 shows the
distribution of the same properties.

1.2

Industries

Brazil classifies economic activities according to the National Classification of Economic Activites (CNAE). For
example, a retailer of appliances and stereos and video is classified as:
• Section G: Trade
• Division 47: Retail Trade
• Group 475: Retailing of computer and communication equipment; equipment and household goods
• Class 4753-9: Retail Sale Specialized in Appliances and Audio/Video Equipment
For our analysis we use the 3 digit level (group) because at this level the industries are diﬀerent enough, while still
providing a stringent criteria for pioneer firms. Moreover, we can be less concerned about reporting errors coming
from the firms not classifying their industry correctly. We identify a major change in the industry classification
between 2005 and 2006, so our study is separated into before and after 2006.
Figure 3 shows how workers are distributed over industries at the 2-digit level (division), and at the 1-digit level
(sections).

1.3

Occupations

The Brazilian Classification of Occupations (CBO) describes and orders occupations according to occupational
characteristics that relate to the nature of the workforce (functions, tasks and obligations, etc.) and the content of
their work (knowledge, abilities, personal attributes and other requirements required for the occupation).
The Ministry of Labor and Employment is responsible for the management and maintenance of the Brazilian
Classification of Occupations. The Brazilian Classification of Occupations underwent an intense revision at the end
2

of the 1990s. Here we use the resulting new version, CBO-2002, with approximately 10 Major Groups, 47 Major
Subgroups, and 596 Basic Groups or Occupational Families. In particular, we use the 4-digit level.
Figure 4 shows the distribution of the workforce according to their occupation at the 2-digit level and 1-digit level
(inset).

Networks of relatedness
Relatedness coeﬃcient

The results presented in the main text rely on a measure of relatedness between industries and occupations built
using labor mobility following [3]. The result of the method described in the main text is a weighted directed network
for each year starting on 2007 (because the mobility of workers between 2006 and 2007 is used to calculate relatedness
for 2007). Figure 5 shows the Pearson correlation for the weights across diﬀerent years. The networks are relatively
stable over time, an important property of a network that aims to capture a property inherent to the similarity
between a pair of industries.
Figures 7 and 8 show the full network for 2008 with a label for each individual node.

Alternative relatedness coeﬃcient

Another common way of measuring relatedness between economic activities is to build a bipartite network, and project
it into one of its sides [4]. Here we use this method to calculate two alternative measures of relatedness, as robustness
checks. First, we calculate relatedness based on co-location of industries and co-location of occupations. Second
we calculate relatedness based on co-occurrence of industries in occupations and on co-occurrence of occupations in
industries.
The co-location relatedness for industries and for occupations are calculated as:
L (t)

φii′

L (t)

ψoo′

(t)

=

Nii′

(t)

(1)

(t)

max{Ni , Ni′ }
(t)

=

Noo′
(t)

(t)

max{No , No′ }

(2)

,

(t)

(t)

where Nii′ is the number of regions that have both industry i and industry i′ at time t, Ni is the number of regions
(t)
that have industry i at time t, Noo′ is the number of regions that have workers in both occupations o and o′ , and
(t)
No is the number of regions that have workers performing occupation o. We say that a region r requires industry
(t)
i when RCAri ≥ 1 [5]:
" !
(t)
(t)
Lri
(t)
r ′ Lr ′ i
RCAri = ! (t)
,
(3)
!
(t)
i′ Lri′
r ′ i′ Lr ′ i′
(t)

where Lri is the number of workers in region r in industry i at time t.
7

In an analogous way we define measures of relatedness based on complementarity:
C (t)

φii′

C (t)

ψoo′

(t)

=

ηii′

(t)

(4)

(t)

max{ηi , ηi′ }
(t)

=

ηoo′
(t)

(t)

max{ηo , ηo′ }

(t)

(5)

,
(t)

where ηii′ is the number of occupations required by both industries i and i′ , ηi is the number of occupations
(t)
(t)
required by only industry i, ηoo′ is the number of industries that required both occupations o and o′ , and ηo is the
(t)
number of industries that require occupation o. In the same way we use RCAri as a criteria for an industry being
(t)
present in a region, we use RCAio as a criteria for when an industry requires an occupation:
" !
(t)
(t)
Lio
(t)
o′ Lio′
RCAio = ! (t)
,
(6)
!
(t)
i′ Li′ o
i′ o′ Li′ o′
(t)

where Lio is the number of workers in industry i developing occupation o at time t.

2.3

Pruning for visualization
(t)

All of the analysis are conducted using the whole time dependent, weighted, directed network characterized by φii′
(t)
for industries and ψoo′ for occupations. For visualizing the network, we follow the pruning method described in [4].
We start by building the minimum spanning tree of the weighted network to use as a skeleton, and then fill nodes
until a certain threshold. For both networks we use the same threshold of 0.67, which ensures that the average degree
of the visualization is between 3 and 4. To layout the nodes we use the Allegro layout implemented in Cytoscape [6].

2.4

Louvain clustering

We use Louvain to cluster the nodes of both networks. We run the community detection algorithm on the minimum
spanning tree associated with the network, so as to make the communities independent of the chosen threshold. We
emphasize the fact that we have not used the communities for any of our main results.
Louvain algorithm [7] is a heuristic method for greedy modularity optimization that returns a multi-level hierarchical scheme. The algorithm consists of two steps that are repeated iteratively. In the first step, modularity is
optimized by local changes. We chose a node and calculate the change in modularity if the node joins the community
of its immediate neighbors. If the change is positive then the modification remains, otherwise it is rolledback. Step
two aggregates the communities obtained in step one, building a new network of communities. On the first one every
node is initialized in its own community and then they are grouped only if the modularity increases, this is repeated
until the modularity reaches a local optimal. In the second phase all nodes in the same community are grouped into
nodes to repeat the first phase again. Here we use the highest level of the dendogram, with the largest communities.
Figures 7 and 8 show the result of Louvain for the minimum spanning tree, and Figure 6 shows how the results of
the Louvain algorithm converge as we approach the minimum spanning tree threshold.

3.1

The knowledge of new firms
Identifying pioneer firms

Pioneer firms are firms that are i) new firms, and ii) bring a new industry to their region. We operationalize these
two characteristics in the following way: i) there is no record of the company for the six years before what we consider
to be the starting year, and ii) there is no record of the industry being in the region for at least two years before the
pioneer’s starting year.
The fact that we need to track the work histories for a pioneer’s first hires for at least two years before the company
started, imposes some constraints on the pioneers we can study. For example, we cannot study pioneers that started
on 2006 because, due to the change in industry classification between 2005 and 2006, we cannot compare the industry
experience of the first hires with the industry of the pioneer. By the same token we cannot study any pioneers from
2007. The need for tracking the work history of first hires implies that we can only study pioneers that started either
on 2005, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, or 2013.
Together with the aforementioned restriction, we add the extra constrain that the company stays alive for at least
one year after its foundation. This condition is not necessary for the analysis, but if provides a more stringent criteria
for the entry of companies, and is there as a way to address some of the concerns we might have regarding reporting
issues. Moreover, adding this condition means that we can now not only focus on the workforce on the first year,
but on the workforce during the first two years. The survival at the second year restriction means that we have to
rule out pioneers that started on 2013. In the main text we show the results for companies that started after 2006,
and in this SM we also show the results for 2005 pioneers without the second year restriction.
In the main text we have presented the results for the three year survival rate, which means three years after their
starting year. Since our data is right-censored, we do not know whether companies that started in 2012 survived on
their third year. This forces us to study only companies that started either on 2008, 2009, or 2010. Moreover, because
in some cases companies will skip a year without that meaning that they are dead, we only consider companies to
be dead if they fail to report for two consecutive years. Since we need to check for this last condition, this forces us
to drop companies that started in 2010.

3.2

Measures of knowledge content; industry and occupation

The main text describes the two measures of knowledge content of a firm in terms of industry knowledge Φ and
occupation knowledge Ψ of its first hires. Here we will dive into the details of how these measures were constructed.
We define a company’s first hires as all the employees that worked in the company during the first two years of its
existence (or during only the first year for companies that started in 2005). Because the first hires can be unemployed
on the previous year, we track their work histories going back two years before the company has started. We then
compare the previous work experience with their particular position in the new company; in terms of occupation and
industry. Since a worker can have performed more than one job, in diﬀerent industries or occupations, we take the
highest similarity between the work experience and the job she is performing in the new company. For example, say
that one of the first employees of a web consulting firm founded in 2008 is a salesperson, who worked as a salesperson
in an insurance company in 2007 and as a developer in a database consulting company in 2006. This employee’s
industry knowledge is given by the similarity between database consulting and web consulting (higher), not by the
similarity between insurance and web consulting (lower). Likewise, this employee’s occupation knowledge is equal to
one, since she has prior experience as salesperson.
Because we are using the work experience of first hires to estimate the industry and occupation knowledge of new
companies, we drop every new company that has over 75% of their workforce coming from outside the labor market.
In other words, we drop companies for which we cannot certainly asses the work experience of their first hires.

Regressions for survival and growth

Here we expand on the analysis conducted in the main text by exploring other specifications of the logistic regression
that explains the three year survival rate.

4.1

Interaction terms

First, we add the interaction term between industry and occupation knowledge to check whether there is a substitution
eﬀect. Table 2 shows the results including the interaction term for the three year survival rate, and Table 3 for the
three year growth rate. The coeﬃcient of the interaction term is negative and significant, implying that there
exists diminishing returns. In other words, when occupation specific knowledge is suﬃcient enough, industry specific
knowledge does not contribute as much. Figure 12 shows the average marginal eﬀect for models (6) and (7) from
Table 2. In both cases, industry knowledge remains positive and significant, providing an average 5% increase in
change of survival for each additional unit of standard deviation, even after controlling for year, industry, and region
characteristics.

Region controls

Table 4 complements our results by replacing the region fixed eﬀects with explicit controls for region characteristics
such as population, gdp per capita, average years of schooling in the region, industry knowledge available in the
region, and non-pioneer survival rate. Non-pioneer survival rate is the survival rate of non-pioneer new firms in
the region, and it is meant to capture how competitive the region is. Industry knowledge available in the region is
calculated as the average industry relatedness of the workers in the region.

Access to capital

Here we resort to five variables that capture how easy it is for companies to access loans in the year and microregion
they started. We use the number of banks at the microregion level obtained from RAIS, the Balance of Credit
operations at the state level provided by Brazil’s central bank [8], the average interest rate at the microregion level
of all the “Indirectly contracted operations” (Operações contratadas na forma indireta automática) from BNDES [9]
(the largest development bank in Brazil), and the total number of operation and the average value of each operation
funded by BNDES. Table 6 shows the results for diﬀerent specifications. We note that even though the coeﬃcients
are not significant, the three BNDES variables add to the predictive power of the model (higher McFadden and lower
AICc). In all of the specifications, the coeﬃcient of industry knowledge remains consistent.

Separating the knowledge of the top, and the knowledge of the rest

The results presented in the main text use a simple average to aggregate over the work experience of all the employees
inside a pioneer firm. Yet, this simple average has the drawback that it might be capturing the eﬀect of most
knowledgeable individual in the company. Here we explore the question of whether it is just one employee (the most
experienced one) who is driving the eﬀect, or if there is also a team level eﬀect. Table 7 separates industry knowledge
into the knowledge of individual with experience in the most related industry, and the average knowledge of all the
other workers. The coeﬃcient of the average relatedness decreases, but it remains significant, suggesting that the
observed eﬀect is not because of the most skilled employee, but rather a combination of the knowledge possessed by
the team. Table 8 shows the separation between the knowledge of the most experienced individual and the rest of
the team for the growth of firms.

Table 7: Eﬀects of industry, occupation, and general knowledge on the survival rate of pioneers at the third year, separating

dropped all pioneers for which we cannot distinguish an individual with more knowledge than everyone else (they all come
from the same industry, for example). All knowledge variables are expressed in standard deviation units.

Table 8: Eﬀects of industry, occupation, and general knowledge on the growth rate of pioneers at the third year, separating
the most knowledgeable individual from the rest for growth. Sample sizes are smaller than in previous regressions because
we have dropped all pioneers for which we cannot distinguish an individual with more knowledge than everyone else (they all
come from the same industry, for example). All knowledge variables are expressed in standard deviation units.

4.5

Alternative operational definition of pioneers

Next, we present the results over a much more stringent definition of pioneer firms. Here, we take all firms that
are new in a region where their industry of operation was not present in the two years before, and that there were
less than 30 workers in that industry in all the neighboring regions combined. This criteria reduces significantly the
number of pioneer firms, so adding fixed eﬀects leads to over-parametrization of the model. Table 9 shows the result
of the three year survival rate, and Table 10 for the three year growth rate for this very stringent definition of pioneer
firms. The eﬀect of industry knowledge is still observable even with this very reduced number of pioneer firms.

Alternative definitions of relatedness to predict survival and growth

We use the definitions of relatedness based on co-location and complementarity, defined in this SM, as a way to
check that our results presented in the main text are not specific to the relatedness measure based on labor mobility.
The industry knowledge and occupation knowledge of each firm are calculated following Eqs. [5] and [6] from the
main text. Thus, we define the co-location industry knowledge (ΦL ), the co-location occupation knowledge (ΨL ),
the complementarity industry knowledge (ΦC ), and the complementarity occupation knowledge (ΨC ). Table 11
compares the results using all measures of relatedness for survival, and Table 12 compares the results for growth.

Cox Proportional Hazards Model

Here we will use the Cox Proportional Hazards model as a way to address right censoring in our data, and to extend
our analysis beyong the three year survival rate.

5.1

Firms from 2005

First, we start with the set of pioneer firms for which we have the longest survival data for; the pioneer firms that
started operating in 2005. Figure 13 shows the Kaplan-Meier curve for pioneer and non-pioneer firms that started
operating in 2005. Table 13 shows the estimates of the Cox proportional hazards model for this set of pioneer firms.
These results confirm what we found using a logistic regression. Figure 14 shows the marginal eﬀects at the mean
for model (6) from Table 13, for varying degrees of industry knowledge and occupation knowledge.

Firms after 2006

Next, we run the Cox proportional hazards model for firms that started after 2008. Figure 15 shows the Kaplan
Meier curves for low and high values of industry knowledge, occupation knowledge, average years of schooling, and
local knowledge (fraction of workers hired from the region). Table 14 shows the result for the Cox regression. The
overall results presented in the main text and in this supplementary information (Table 2) are confirmed. Figure 16
shows the marginal eﬀect at the mean of industry and occupation knowledge for models (6) and (7) from Table 14.

Bartik instruments for supply of workers

The definition of the Bartik instrument that we use in the main text relies on the measure of relatedness based on
(t)
(ind)
labor flow φii′ . A high positive value of Bri (t) means that a lot of the industries related to industry i that are
(ind)
present in region r have grown at the national level. A negative value of Bri (t) means that a lot of the industries
(ind)
related to industry i that are present in region r have declined at the national level. Small values of Bri (t) mean
that either the industries related to i have not experienced significant shocks, or that these industries are not present
in region r.
There is a legitimate concern regarding potential forward and backward linkages between industry i and its related
industries. In other words, the industries related to industry i that are present in region r might lead to growth of
industry i because of an increase in demand for i or an increase in supply for i. This mechanism, however, would
lead to a positive correlation between the shock and the industry knowledge in the first stage, which is something
we do not observe. Yet, this will technically lead to a potential violation of the exclusion restriction.
To solve this potential violation of the exclusion restriction we use the 2010 Input-Output Matrix published by
the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) [10]. Input-Output data for Brazil is only available for
67 economic activities, a higher level of aggregation than the one we use in the main text. The lack of granularity
has the drawback that if we use this classification of 67 economic activities to define pioneer firms, we significantly
reduce the number of pioneers.
We use the input-output information to correct the measure of relatedness we use in the Bartik instrument, such
that relatedness is now defined by labor flows after controlling for input-output. The new Bartik instrument is
defined as:
(ind)

(t)

(t)

(t)

Fi↔i′ = β0 + β1 gii′ + β2 L̃ii′ + β3 Xii′ + δii′ ,

where Fi↔i′ is the total flow of workers in log-scale going from i to i′ and from i′ to i between year t − 1 and t.
(t)
(t) (t)
(t)
(t)
(t−1)
gii′ = max{gi , gi′ } is the maximum growth rate in the number of employees gi = ln Li − ln Li
between both
(t)
(t)
(t)
industries, L̃ii′ = max{Li , Li′ } is the maximum number of employees between both industries, in log-scale, and
(t)
Li is the number of employees of industry i in year t, also in log-scale. In this supplementary material we have
(t)
′
→i
added Xii′ , which is the logarithm of the maximum between xxi→i
, xxi→i′′ , xxi′′→i , and xxi′→i
, as done in [11], where
i→
→i
i →
′
xi→i′ is the output of i going to i , x→i is the input of i, and xi→ is the output of i.
Table 15 shows the result using the Bartik shock adjusted using input-output data for pioneers defined as in the
main text, and for pioneers defined using only the 67 sectors from the input-output data. The instrument is weak in
both cases, and the standard errors are high. Yet, the point estimate confirms the direction of the relation we report
in the main text.
