Risks and Returns of Cryptocurrency
Yukun Liu and Aleh Tsyvinski
NBER Working Paper No. 24877
August 2018
JEL No. G12,G32
ABSTRACT
We establish that the risk-return tradeoff of cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum) is
distinct from those of stocks, currencies, and precious metals. Cryptocurrencies have no exposure
to most common stock market and macroeconomic factors. They also have no exposure to the
returns of currencies and commodities. In contrast, we show that the cryptocurrency returns can
be predicted by factors which are specific to cryptocurrency markets. Specifically, we determine
that there is a strong time-series momentum effect and that proxies for investor attention strongly
forecast cryptocurrency returns. Finally, we create an index of exposures to cryptocurrencies of
354 industries in the US and 137 industries in China.

Introduction

Cryptocurrency is a recent phenomenon that is receiving significant attention. On the one hand it is based
on a fundamentally new technology, the potential of which is not fully understood. On the other hand, at least
in the current form, it fullfils similar functions as other, more traditional assets. Is cryptocurrency a form of
a currency, a commodity, a stake in a technology breakthrough, or a completely different instrument? Can
cryptocurrency be priced by the factors available for other asset classes? Which industries may be affected
by the development of blockchain technology?
One way to understand what cryptocurrencies represent is to investigate whether their returns behave
similarly to other asset classes. In other words, we assess how investors and markets value current and future
prospects of cryptocurrencies. We use standard tools of empirical asset pricing to comprehensively analyze
cryptocurrency risks and returns. Specifically, we study whether major cryptocurrencies comove with stocks,
currencies, commodities, macroeconomic factors, and the cryptocurrency market specific factors. Our main
conclusion is that only cryptocurrency market specific factors – momentum and the proxies for investor
attention – consistently explain the variations of cryptocurrency returns. This suggests, in contrast to
popular explanations, that markets do not view cryptocurrencies similarly to standard asset classes.
We focus on three of the five major cryptocurrencies – Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum1 – and start by
documenting the characteristics of cryptocurrency returns. We observe that the mean and the standard
deviation of returns are an order of magnitude higher than those for the traditional asset classes. For
example, the weekly mean return on Bitcoin is 3.79 percent with a standard deviation of 16.64 percent. The
Sharpe ratios at the daily and weekly levels are about 50 percent and 75 percent higher, and at the monthly
level are comparable to those of stocks. The returns have positive skewness increasing with the frequencies
from daily to monthly. The returns experience high probabilities of “disasters” and “miracles”. For example,
a “disaster” of the daily 20 percent negative return on Bitcoin happens with the probability of 0.5 percent
while a “miracle” of the same size happens with the probability of almost 1 percent.
We first investigate whether the cryptocurrency market behaves similarly to the stock market. We test
this by studying whether the returns on the cryptocurrency market are compensated by the risk factors
derived from the stock market. We show that the CAPM betas are sizable but the alphas remain large
and statistically significant. The exposures to other common risk factors in the stock market are very
small. Specifically, the exposures to Fama French five risk factors are low and not statistically significant.
Compared to Bitcoin, Ripple and Ethereum have higher unconditional alphas, a smaller CAPM beta, and a
strong exposure to the HML factor. We also explore 155 other factors documented in the finance literature
and find no discernible patterns of loadings.
Second, we study the exposure of cryptocurrency returns to major currencies (Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Singaporean Dollar, and UK Pound). This aims to test a popular view that cryptocurrency
may serve as another medium of exchange. Although these major currenices strongly comove, we find that
the exposures of all cryptocurrencies to these currencies are small and not statistically significant.
Third, we study the exposure of cryptocurrency returns to precious metals commodities (gold, platinum,
and silver). This aims to test a popular narrative that cryptocurrency may serve as an alternative to precious
metals as a store of value. With the exception of the exposure of Ethereum to gold, the exposures of all
other cryptocurrencies to these commodities are not statistically significant.
Fourth, we study the exposure of cryptocurrency returns to macroeconomic factors. For Bitcoin and
1 The

other two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are BitcoinCash and Litecoin which are derived from, and
thus behave similarly to, Bitcoin.

2

Ripple, the exposures to common macroeconomic factors (the non-durable consumption growth, durable
consumption growth, industrial production growth, and personal income growth) are low and not statistically
significant, while for Ethereum there is some loading on the durable consumption growth factor.
Summarizing, we established that the risk-return tradeoff of cryptocurrencies is distinct from those of
stocks, currencies and precious metals. Hence, there is little evidence, in the view of the markets, behind
the popular narratives that there are similarities between cryptocurrencies and these traditional assets.
We now turn to cryptocurrency specific factors. We formulate and investigate potential predictors for
cryptocurrency returns that mirror those of traditional asset classes. Specifically, we construct cryptocurrency momentum, proxies for average and negative investor attention, a proxy for price-to-“dividend” ratio,2
realized volatility, and proxies for the supply conditions.
First, we show that there is significant time-series cryptocurrency momentum at the daily and weekly
frequencies for all three cryptocurrencies. For example, a one-standard-deviation increase in the current day’s
Bitcoin return predicts a 0.33 percent increase in the daily return over the next day. Grouping weekly returns
by quintiles, we find that the top quintiles outperform the bottom quintiles over the 1-4 week horizons. For
example, at the 1-week horizon, the average return of the top quintile is 11.22 percent per week with the
Sharpe ratio of 0.45 while the average return of the bottom quintile is 2.60 percent per week with the Sharpe
ratio of 0.19. However, for Ethereum, the momentum effect is less significant than for Bitcoin and Ripple.
Second, we construct proxies for investor attention and show that high investor attention predicts high
future returns over 1-2 week horizons for Bitcoin, a 1-week horizon for Ripple, and 1-, 3-, and 6-week horizons
for Ethereum. For example, a one-standard-deviation increase in the Google search for the word “Bitcoin”
yields a 2.3 percent increase in the 2-week ahead Bitcoin returns. At the 1-week horizon, the average return
of the top quintile is 11.20 percent per week with the Sharpe ratio of 0.48 while the average return of the
bottom quintile is 1.07 percent per week with the Sharpe ratio of 0.08. Another proxy for investor attention
we construct is Twitter post counts. A one-standard-deviation increase in the Twitter post count for the
word “Bitcoin” yields a 2.50 percent increase in the 1-week ahead Bitcoin returns. Finally, we construct a
proxy for negative investor attention and show that relatively high negative investor attention negatively
predicts future Bitcoin returns. We construct a ratio between Google searches for the phrase “Bitcoin hack”
and searches for the word “Bitcoin,” and show that a one-standard-devation increase of the ratio leads to a
2.75 percent decrease in Bitcoin returns the following week.
Third, we construct a proxy for the the price-to-“dividend” ratios for Bitcoin and find that it has no
predictive power. Realized volatility also does not predict returns of Bitcoin and Ethereum but predicts
Ripple returns at 4-, 5-, and 7-day ahead frequencies.
Finally, we construct proxies for the cost of mining to capture the supply factors, and find that those
have low loadings for Bitcoin and Ripple. For Ethereum, there is some evidence that returns are exposed
to the stock returns of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), one of the main manufacturers of specialized
mining hardware.
Our main conclusion is that indeed cryptocurrency represents an asset class that can be assessed using
simple finance tools. At the same time, cryptocurrencies comprise an asset class which is radically different
from traditional asset classes.
Our last group of results determines the exposures of various industries to cryptocurrencies. These
results indicate which industries may benefit or may be disrupted by the blockchain technology. We start
with 30 Fama French industries and find that Consumer Goods and Healthcare have significant and positive

exposures to Bitcoin returns and that Fabricated Products and Metal Mining industries have significant and
negative exposures to Bitcoin returns. Finance, Retail, and Wholesale industries have no exposure. We then
estimate the exposures of 354 U.S. SIC 3-digit industries’ on cryptocurrency returns and 137 Chinese CIC
industries exposures on Bitcoin returns, controlling for the excess market returns, and create an index of
industry exposures.
We now briefly discuss the relationship to the literature. Our paper uses standard textbook empirical
asset pricing tools and methods, the discussion of which we mostly omit for conciseness. Our findings on
momentum are related to a series of papers such as Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), Moskowitz and Grinblatt
(1999). Moskowitz, Ooi, and Pedersen (2012), and Asness, Moskowitz, and Pedersen (2013). Da, Engelberg,
and Gao (2011) uses Google searches to proxy for investor attention. Yermack (2015) is one of the first papers
that brought academic attention to the field of cryptocurrency. Several recent papers (e.g., Stoffels, 2017,
Borri, 2018, Borri and Shakhnov, 2018, Foley, Karlsen, and Putniņš (2018), and Hu, Parlour, and Rajan,
2018) document individual facts related to cryptocurrency investment. A number of recent papers develop
models of cryptocurrencies (see, e.g., Weber (2016), Huberman, Leshno, and Moallemi (2017), Biais et al.
(2018), Chiu and Koeppl (2017), Cong and He, 2018, Cong, Li, and Wang, 2018, Cong, He, and Li, 2018,
Sockin and Xiong, 2018, Saleh, 2018, Schilling and Uhlig, 2018, Abadi and Brunnermeier (2018), Routledge
and Zetlin-Jones (2018), and Makarov and Schoar (2018)).

Data and Basic Characteristics

Cryptocurrency price data series are from the CoinDesk website. For Bitcoin, we use data from 01/01/2011
to 05/31/2018 because there was not much liquidity and trading in earlier years. The data series for Ripple ranges from 08/04/2013 to 05/31/2018, and the data series for Ethereum ranges from 08/07/2015 to
05/31/2018. We construct cryptocurrency return data using the corresponding price data. Google search
data series are downloaded from Google. Twitter post counts for the word “Bitcoin” are downloaded from
Crimson Hexagon.3 The data series for the number of Bitcoin Wallet users is from blockchain.info. The Bitcoin price-to-“dividend” ratio is constructed from the ratio between Bitcoin price and the number of Bitcoin
wallet users. The cryptocurrency realized volatility is measured as the sum of daily squared log returns from
the previous month.
The spot exchange rates in units of US dollar per foreign currency are from the Federal Reserve Bank of
St. Louis. We focus on five major currencies: Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Singaporean Dollar,
and UK Pound. The spot price of precious metals are from several sources. The gold and silver prices are
from the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA). Platinum prices are from the London Platinum and
Palladium Market (LPPM).
Aggregate and individual stock return data is from CRSP. Detailed SIC 3-digit industry return data series
are constructed using individual stock returns. Chinese stock return data is from CSMAR. We construct the
value-weighted aggregate Chinese stock returns and detailed CIC (China Industry Classification) industry
return data series from the individual stocks. The data series of Chinese stock returns lasts until 2016/12.
Corporate bond return data series is constructed by Asvanunt and Richardson (2016) and is available on
their website.4 For the housing market, we use the Case-Shiller housing index from Robert Shiller’s website.
The return series of the 155 anomalies are downloaded from Andrew Chen’s website.5

of the 156 anomalies does not exist during the sample period. The database ends at 2016/12.

4

We obtain the Fama French 3-factor, Carhart 4-factor, Fama French 5-factor, and Fama French 6-factor
models dataseries from Kenneth French’s website. We also obtain the return series of Fama French 30
industries, Europe, Japan, AsiaExJapan, and North America from Kenneth French’s website.
The macroeconomic data series are from the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Nondurable consumption is defined as the sum of personal consumption expenditures: non-durable goods, and
personal consumption expenditures: services.
Stock market prices, dividends, and earnings, as well as the three-month Treasury bill rates, are from
Robert Shiller’s website. Using these data series, we construct the stock market price-to-dividend ratio (pd),
price-to-earning ratio (pe), and the relative bill rate (tbill). The relative bill rate is defined as the threemonth Treasury bill rate minus its twelve-month backward moving average. Credit spread (credit) is defined
as the yield spread between BAA corporate bonds and AAA corporate bonds. Term spread (term) is defined
as the yield spread between the 10-year treasury and 3-month treasury. Data series on the BAA corporate
yield, AAA corporate yield, 10-year treasury yield, and 3-month treasury yield are from the Federal Reserve
Bank of St. Louis’ website.
We now document main statistical properties of the time series for the returns of Bitcoin, Ripple, and
Ethereum. Figure 1 plots the price movements for each of the three cryptocurrencies.

Figure 4: Ethereum Return Distributions

Table 1 and Figure 2 show the statistics of Bitcoin at the daily, weekly, and monthly frequencies compared
to those of stocks, corporate bonds, and housing. Both the returns and their volatility are very high. At the
daily frequency, the mean return is 0.52 percent and the standard deviation is 5.55 percent; at the weekly
frequency, the mean return is 3.79 percent and the standard deviation is 16.64 percent; at the monthly
frequency, the mean return is 21.60 percent and the standard deviation is 69.46 percent. Both the means
and the standard deviations are an order of magnitude higher than those for traditional asset classes. These
facts are broadly known.
The Sharpe ratios of bitcoin returns are 0.09 at the daily frequency, 0.23 at the weekly frequency, and
0.31 at the monthly frequency. At the monthly frequency, the Sharpe ratios are similar to those of stocks
for the comparable time period, although higher than the historical Sharpe ratios for stocks. At the daily
and weekly frequencies, the Sharpe ratios are about 50 percent and 75 percent higher than those of stocks
for the comparable time period.
In Tables 2, and 3 and Figures 3 and 4, we document the main characteristics of the Ripple and Ethereum
6

returns. Note that since the Ripple return series starts on 08/04/2013 and the Ethereum return series starts
on 08/07/2015, in the tables we present the statistics for Bitcoin for the corresponding periods. For the
Ripple returns, the Sharpe ratios are 0.06 at the daily frequency, 0.13 at the weekly frequency, and 0.25 at
the monthly frequency. The Ripple returns have a markedly higher mean and standard deviation compared
to the Bitcoin returns of the period. However, during this period the Sharpe ratios of Ripple returns are
comparable to the Sharpe ratios of Bitcoin returns. For Ethereum, the Sharpe ratios are 0.11 at the daily
frequency, 0.28 at the weekly frequency, and 0.53 at the monthly frequency. The Ethereum returns also have
higher mean and standard deviation than Bitcoin returns during the same period. However, during this
period the Sharpe ratios of Ethereum returns are comparable to the Sharpe ratios of Bitcoin returns.
The Bitcoin returns are positively skewed at all frequencies in contrast to the stock returns which are
negatively skewed. The skewness increases from 0.80 at the daily frequency to 1.76 at the weekly frequency,
and to 4.32 at the monthly frequency. The corresponding kurtosis is 15.21 at the daily frequency, 10.25 at
the weekly frequency, and 25.38 at the monthly frequency. The bitcoin returns have high probabilities of
exceptional negative and positive daily returns. For example, the probability of a -20 percent daily return
“disaster” is almost 0.5 percent; the probability of a 20 percent daily return “miracle” is almost 1 percent.
The Ripple and Ethereum returns have similar characteristics: (1) positively skewed at all frequencies and
having high kurtosis; and (2) high probabilities of exceptional negative and positive daily returns.

Table 4 shows the mean, standard deviation, and Sharpe ratios of the returns on different days of the
week. In contrast to the stocks, there is no pronounced Monday effect. However, the returns are lower on
Saturdays: Bitcoin – 0.33 percent with the Sharpe ratio of 0.06 compared to 0.52 percent daily average with
the Sharpe ratio of 0.09; Ripple – -0.14 percent with the Sharpe ratio of -0.02 compared to 0.59 percent daily
average with the Sharpe ratio of 0.06; and Ethereum – 0.26 percent with the Sharpe ratio of 0.03 compared
to 0.81 percent daily average with the Sharpe ratio of 0.03. While Bitcoin returns are somewhat lower on
Sundays, the returns on Saturday is consistently lower across all three cryptocurrencies.
In this paper, we report two types of t-statistics: (1) based on regular standard error, and (2) based on
bootstrapped standard error. The first type is reported in parentheses and the second type is reported in
brackets.

Risk Exposures

In this section, we establish facts on factor loadings and on exposures to stocks, currencies, and precious
metals commodities. Throughout this section, t-statistics in parentheses and brackets are based on regular
and bootstrapped standard errors.

3.1

Stock Factors Loadings

Table 5 documents the common stock factor exposures of the Bitcoin returns. For the risk factors, we
choose the CAPM, Fama French 3-factor, Carhart 4-factor, Fama French 5-factor, and Fama French 6-factor
models. The alphas for all of the considered models are statistically significant. The unconditional alpha of
the period is 22.45 percent per month. The CAPM adjusted alpha decreases to 18.91 percent per month – a
reduction of about 16 percent. The CAPM beta is large at 3.34 but not statistically significant. The beta is
statistically significant at the 10-percent level only for the 5-factor and 6-factor models. The corresponding
alphas are 16.72 and 15.98 percent per month. The exposures to the other factors are not statistically
significant. The exposures to the SMB factor is not stable across the specifications: both the magnitude
9

and the signs change when 5-factor and 6-factor models are considered. The exposures to the HML factor
are negative and have consistent magnitudes and signs; this suggests that Bitcoin returns may comove more
with growth rather than with value firms. The exposures to the RMW factor are positive and are estimated
slightly more accurately than other statistically not significant factors; this suggests that Bitcoin returns
comove more with high profit rather than low profit firms. The point estimates on the MOM and CMA
factors are very inaccurate.6

Table 6 documents the common stock factor exposures of the Ripple returns and compares them to the
Bitcoin returns for the same time period. The Bitcoin returns for this time period have similar risk exposures
as those in the full sample but have smaller and mostly insignificant alphas. We now turn to the analysis
of Ripple. The alphas for all of the considered models are statistically significant. The unconditional alpha
of the period is 38.15 percent per month and is more than twice as large as that for Bitcoin. The CAPM
adjusted alpha is about the same as the unadjusted alpha. The CAPM beta is about half the size of Bitcoin
and is not significant. In contrast to Bitcoin, there are statistically significant large negative loadings on the
HML factor within the 5-factor and 6-factor models. The exposures to the other factors are not statistically
significant. Summarizing, Ripple has performed better than Bitcoin for the corresponding time period, and
its returns comove with growth rather than value firms.

6 Stoffels

(2017) and Gilbert and Loi (2018) examine cryptocurrency loadings on the CAPM and Fama French 3-factor

models.

Table 7 documents the common stock factor exposures of the Ethereum returns and compares them to the
12

Bitcoin returns for the same time period. The Bitcoin returns for this time period have a smaller exposure
to the market and also have smaller alphas compared to the full sample. We now turn to the analysis of
Ethereum. The alphas for all the considered models are statistically significant. The unconditional alpha of
the period is 32.87 percent per month, comparable to Ripple and more than two times larger than that of
Bitcoin. The CAPM adjusted alpha is about the same as the unadjusted alpha. The CAPM beta is about
the same size as Bitcoin and is not significant. In contrast to Bitcoin, there is significant large negative
loadings on the HML factor for 3-factor, 4-factor, 5-factor and 6-factor models. The exposures to the other
factors are not statistically significant. Summarizing, Ethereum has performed better than Bitcoin for the
corresponding time period, and its returns comove with the growth rather than the value firms for all of the
specifications of the multi-factor models.

3.2

Currency

Table 8 shows currency exposures of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum returns. For currency returns, we
consider five major currencies: Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Singaporean Dollar, and UK
Pound. The exposures of all other cryptocurrencies to these commodities are not statistically significant
and the alpha estimates barely change. In Table 9, we investigate the currency exposures of Bitcoin returns
over shorter periods corresponding to those of Ripple and Ethereum. Again, the currency exposures of
Bitcoin returns over the shorter periods are small and statistically insignificant. We conclude that there is
no consistent evidence of systematic currency exposures in cryptocurrencies.

We further test cryptocurrency exposures on currency factors as in Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan
(2011) instead of individual currency returns.7 Table 10 reports the results for each of the three cryptocurrencies. Consistent with the results on individual currency returns, we find that none of the three
cryptocurrencies has significant exposures to the currency factors.

7 We

thank Nicola Borri for providing us with the up-to-date currency factors.

Precious Metals Commodities

Table 11 shows commodity exposures of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum returns. For commodity returns,
we consider gold, platinum, and crude oil. With the exception of the exposure of Ethereum to gold, the exposures of all other cryptocurrencies to these commodities are not statistically significant. At the same time,
note that the alphas of Bitcoin and Ripple decrease, respectively, when gold and platinum are considered. In
Table 12, we investigate the commodity exposures of Bitcoin returns over shorter periods corresponding to
those of Ripple and Ethereum. During the Ripple period, Bitcoin negatively covaries with gold and platinum
returns, similar to Ripple. For the Ethereum period, Bitcoin negatively covariates with platinum returns,
in contrast with the behavior of Ethereum. We conclude that there is no consistent evidence of systematic
commodity exposures in cryptocurrencies.

Exploring the Factor Zoo

Finance literature has documented more than a hundred factors for predicting the cross-section of stock
returns (see, e.g., summarizes in Feng, Giglio, and Xiu, 2017 and Chen and Velikov, 2017). To investigate
whether any of those factors may be important in pricing cryptocurrencies, we estimate the loadings of the
155 common factors from Andrew Chen’s website. One caveat is that this dataset ends at the end of 2016
and thus does not cover the most recent return experiences. Therefore, it can only be meaningfully used
for the analysis of Bitcoin. We report the results in the Appendix, due to the large number of factors. We
find that only four out of the 155 factors are significant, but those four factors do not form any discernible
patterns.

3.5

Macroeconomic Factors

Table 13 shows macroeconomic factor exposures of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum returns. For macroeconomic factors, we consider the non-durable consumption growth, durable consumption growth, industrial
production growth, and personal income growth. For Bitcoin and Ripple, all of the exposures are not
statistically significant.8 For Ethereum, notably, the durable consumption growth factor has a significant
loading.

8 In

the Appendix, we also report the results for Bitcoin for the time periods corresponding to those of Ripple and Ethereum.
The results are the same as for the full sample.

Cryptocurrency Specific Factors

In this section, we first develop and investigate cryptocurrency specific predictors. We consider momentum, proxies for investor attention, proxies for the price-to-“dividend” ratio, and the volatility – all of which
are specific to the individual cryptocurrency markets. Finally, we construct proxies for cryptocurrency supply conditions. Throughout this section, t-statistics in parentheses and brackets are based on regular and
bootstrapped standard errors.

4.1

Cryptocurrency Momentum

We first establish that there is very strong evidence of momentum at various time horizons. Table 14
documents the time-series momentum results. For Bitcoin daily returns, the current return positively and
statistically significantly predicts 1-day, 3-day, 5-day, and 6-day ahead returns. A one standard deviation
increase in today’s return leads to increases in daily returns by 0.33 percent,9 0.17 percent, 0.39 percent,
and 0.50 percent increases at the 1-day, 3-day, 5-day, and 6-day ahead returns, respectively. Specifically, the
1-day ahead daily return is that of buying a Bitcoin at 11:59:59 UTD today and selling at 11:59:59 UTD
one day later.
For Bitcoin weekly returns, the current return positively and statistically significantly predicts 1-week,
2-week, 3-week, and 4-week ahead returns. A one-standard-deviation increase in this week’s return leads to
increases in weekly returns of 3.16 percent,10 3.66 percent, 3.49 percent, and 1.50 percent increases at the
1-week, 2-week, 3-week, and 4-week ahead returns, respectively. Specifically, the 1-week ahead weekly return
is that of buying a Bitcoin at 11:59:59 UTD Sunday and selling at 11:59:59 UTD one week later.
9 The 0.33 percent daily return is calculated by multiplying a one-standard-deviation increase of today’s return (5.55 percent)
and the coefficient estimate (0.06).
10 The 3.16 percent weekly return is calculated by multiplying one-standard-deviation increase of today’s return (16.64
percent) and the coefficient estimate (0.19).

20

In Table 15, we estimate the time-series momentum by grouping weekly returns into quintiles and evaluating their performance going forward. We find that the top quintiles outperform the bottom quintiles at
1-4 week ahead horizons. For example, at the 1-week horizon, the average return of the top quintile is 11.22
percent per week with the Sharpe ratio of 0.45 while the average return of the bottom quintile is 2.60 percent
per week with the Sharpe ratio of 0.19. In Table 16, we restrict our sample to 2013 onward. Again, we
find a strong and statistically significant momentum effect of somewhat smaller magnitude.11 In Table 17,
we use the first two years of data to determine the quintile cutoffs and study the out-of-sample momentum
performance, and we find strong momentum effect as well.

Cryptocurrency Investor Attention

In this section, we investigate the role of investor attention for the cryptocurrency returns. Specifically,
we construct the deviation of Google searches for the words “Bitcoin”, “Ripple”, and “Ethereum” in a given
23

week compared to the average of those in the preceding four weeks. We match Google searches for the word
“Bitcoin” with Bitcoin data, searches for the word “Ripple” with Ripple data, and searches for the word
“Ethereum” with Ethereum data.
Table 19 reports the results for Bitcoin. For weekly returns, the Google search proxy statistically significantly predicts 1-week and 2-week ahead returns. A one-standard-deviation increase in this week’s searches
leads to increases in weekly returns of 1.84 percent and 2.30 percent at the 1-week and 2-week ahead returns.12
In Table 20, we investigate the Google search proxy by grouping the weekly Google search deviations
into quintiles and evaluating their performance going forward. We find that the top quintile outperforms the
bottom quintile at 1-4 week ahead horizons. For example, at the 1-week horizon, the average return of the
top quintile is 11.20 percent per week with the Sharpe ratio of 0.48 while the average return of the bottom
quintile is 1.07 percent per week with the Sharpe ratio of 0.08.
Table 21 reports the same calculation for the more recent period since 2013. The results are similar to
that of the full sample. The top quintile outperforms the bottom quintile at the 1-4 week ahead horizons.
For example, at the 2-week horizon, the average return of the top quintile is 8.90 percent with the Sharpe
ratio of 0.40 while the average return of the bottom quintile is 0.57 percent per week with the Sharpe ratio
of 0.04. In Table 22, we use the first two years of data to determine the quintile cutoffs and study the
out-of-sample effect of investor attention, and we find strong positive investor attention effect as well.

12 Wang and Vergne (2017) use the level of newspaper mentions of Bitcoin to proxy for the “buzz” of Bitcoin. They document
that high “buzz” predicts low Bitcoin returns in the future. Mai et al. (2016) use the level of Twitter post counts to predict
Bitcoin returns.

Table 23 reports the results for Ripple. For weekly returns, the Google search proxy statistically significantly predicts 1-week ahead returns. A one-standard-deviation increase in this week’s searches leads to
increases in weekly returns of 10.86 percent at the 1-week ahead returns. The results for Bitcoin for the
same period are comparable to those for other samples and to those for Ripple.

Table 24 reports the results for Ethereum. For weekly returns, the Google search proxy statistically
significantly predicts 1-week, 3-week, and 6-week ahead returns. A one-standard-deviation increase in this
week’s searches leads to increases in weekly returns of 4.36 percent, 3.45 percent, and 3.65 percent at the
1-week, 3-week and 6-week ahead returns. The results for Bitcoin for the same period are comparable to
those for other samples and to those for Ripple.

We are also interested in the question of whether past returns are associated with increases in investor
attention. We regress this week’s deviation in the Google searches on the contemporaneous and the previous
four weeks Bitcoin returns. Table 25 documents the results. We find that the deviations in Google searches
are significantly associated with the contemporaneous and previous weeks Bitcoin returns.

Negative Investor Attention

We have shown that unconditionally investor attention positively predicts cryptocurrency returns. In
this section, we further investigate whether negative investor attention predicts cryptocurrency returns. We
construct a ratio between Google searches for the phrase “Bitcoin hack” and searches for the word “Bitcoin”
to proxy for negative investor attention. Table 28 shows the results of the predictive regressions. The ratio
negatively and significantly predicts 1-5 week Bitcoin retruns. For example, a one-standard-devation increase
of the ratio leads to a 2.75 percent decrease of Bitcoin returns in next week.

Crypto Price-to-“Dividend” and Crypto Volatility

Obviously, there is no direct measure of dividend for the cryptocurrencies. However, in its essence, the
price-to-dividend ratio is a measure of the gap between the market value and the fundamental value of an
asset. The market value of cryptocurrency is just the observed price. We proxy the fundamental value by
using the number of Bitcoin Wallet users. We regress the Bitcoin returns on the lagged Bitcoin price-to“dividend” ratio and the results are reported in Table 30. Overall, there is very weak relation between the
future Bitcoin returns and the current price-to-”dividend” ratio. For Ripple and Ethereum, the data on the
number of users is not immediately available.

We also investigate whether realized volatility predicts cryptocurrency returns. We regress cryptocurrency
returns for the past month realized return volatility and the results are reported in Table 31. Overall, there
is very weak relation between future cryptocurrency returns and the realized volatility for Bitcoin and
Ethereum. For Ripple, there is some evidence that realized volatility positively predicts 4-day, 5-day, and
7-day ahead Ripple returns.

Supply Factors

We now construct proxies for the supply factors. To the first approximation, mining a cryptocurrency
requires two inputs: electricity and computer power. For electricity, we consider three proxies: (1) the valueweighted stock returns of the U.S.-listed electricity industries, (2) the value-weighted stock returns of the
China-listed electricity industries, and (3) the Sinopec (SNP) stock returns. The reason why we include the
China proxies is because electricity supply is location specific and because China is considered to have the
largest coin mining operation among all countries.13 For proxies of computer power, we consider the stock
returns of the companies that are major manufacturers of either GPU mining chips (Nvidia Corporation
and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc) or ASIC mining chips (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company,
Limited and Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc).14 Table 32 presents the results for the three

cryptocurrencies. Somewhat surprisingly, the Bitcoin and Ripple returns are not statistically significantly
exposed to any of these supply factors proxies. There is some evidence that Ethereum returns are exposed
to the AMD stock returns. We also consider the possibility that the supply factors are more important in
the recent periods as mining becomes costlier with the increase in popularity of the cryptocurrencies, but
we find no support for this hypothesis (See Appendix).

Industry Exposures to Bitcoin Risk

In this section, we first estimate the exposures of the Fama French 30 industry groups to the cryptocurrency risk. Second, we continue with a finer industry classification and investigate the cryptocurrency risk
exposures of 354 SIC industries in the US and 137 CIC industries in China. These exposures which can be
thought of as an index indicating the potential winners and losers from the current and future development
of blockchain. Throughout this section, t-statistics in parentheses and brackets are based on regular and
bootstrapped standard errors.

Table 33 reports the Fama French 30 industries’ exposures on Bitcoin returns controlling for the excess
market returns. Specifically, we regress each industry’s stock returns on the contemporaneous Bitcoin returns
33

and the excess stock market returns. The Consumer Goods (Hshld) and Healthcare (Hlth) industries are
positively and statistically significantly affected while the Fabricated Products (FabPr) and Metal Mining
(Mines) industries are negatively and statistically significantly affected. These point estimates state that
a one-standard-deviation increase in Bitcoin returns is associated with the 0.49 percent increase in the
return of the Consumer Goods industry, 0.44 percent increase in the return of the Healthcare industry, 0.66
percent decrease in the return of the Fabricated Products industry, and 1.15 percent decrease in the return
of the Metal Mining. Surprisingly, the often mentioned Finance, Retail, and Wholesale industries have no
statistically significant exposure, and the magnitude of the point estimates is very small.

Table 34 reports the Fama French 30 industries’ exposures on the Ripple returns controlling for the excess
market returns. The Restaurant, Hotels, Motels (meals) industry is positively and statistically significantly
affected while the Utility (util) industry is negatively and statistically significantly affected. We report the
Fama French 30 industry exposures to Bitcoin returns for the same time period as well. The only statistically
significant point estimate comes from the Printing and Publishing (books, negative) industry. Although the
point estimates are not significant, the directions of the estimates are similar to those in the full sample. For
example, Consumer Goods and Healthcare industries are positively exposed while Fabricated Products and
Metal Mining industries are negatively exposed.
Table 35 reports the Fama French 30 industries’ exposures on Ethereum return controlling for the excess
market returns. The Restaurant, Hotels, Motels (meals) industry is positively and statistically significantly
affected while the Banking, Insurance, Real Estate, Trading (fin) industry is negatively and statistically
significantly affected. We report the Fama French 30 industry exposures to Bitcoin returns for the same
time period as well. The statistically significant point estimates are the Beer and Liquor (beer, positive)

35

and the Restaurant, Hotels, Motels (meals, positive) industries. Again, the signs of the point estimates are
similar to those of the full sample.

Furthermore, we examine the exposures of different regions to Bitcoin risk. Table 36 documents our
findings. We obtain the return series of the different regions from Kenneth French’s website. U.S., Europe,
Japan, and Canada have similar exposures to Bitcoin risk – all positive but not statistically significant. Note
that the point estimate for Europe is somewhat higher and for AsiaExJapan is significantly lower than the
rest.

Potential Winners and Losers: Index of Cryptocurrency Exposures

In this section, we estimate the 354 U.S. SIC 3-digit industries’ on cryptocurrency returns and 137 of
China’s CIC industries exposures on Bitcoin returns, controlling for the excess market returns. Specifically,
we regress each industry’s stock returns on the contemporaneous Bitcoin returns and the excess stock market
returns. Each industry’s stock return is calculated as value-weighted returns from individual publicly listed
companies in the industry. The complete results are reported in the Appendix for conciseness. We then
standardize the exposure estimates to have mean zero and standard deviation of one to create an index of
the exposures of the industries to the cryptocurrencies. Figure 5 reports the histogram of the values of the
index for each cryptocurrency for the 354 US industries and Figure 6 reports the same for the 137 Chinese
industries.

Conclusion

We conclude that cryptocurrency returns have low exposures to traditional asset classes – stocks, currencies, and commodities. Our findings cast doubt on popular explanations that the behavior of cryptocurrencies
is driven by its functions as a stake in the future of blockhain technology similar to stocks, as a unit of account
similar to currencies, or as a store of value similar to precious metal commodities. At the same time, the
returns of cryptocurrency can be predicted by two factors specific to its markets – momentum and investors
attention. Our findings call into question popular explanations that supply factors such as mining costs,
price-to-”dividend” ratio, or realized volatitility are useful for predicting the behavior of cryptocurrency
returns. Finally, we document that the blockchain technology embodied in cryptocurrencies has a potential
to affect a number of important industries.

Appendix B: Implied Risk Neutral Disaster Probability
In this section, we calculate the risk neutral disaster probability that can justify the realized high average
cryptocurrency returns. We define a disaster as an event where the cryptocurrency price drops to zero in one
day. We further calculate the average cryptocurrency return as the trailing one year average daily return.
When the implied risk neutral disaster probability is negative, we modify it to zero. Figure A.3 plots the
time-varying implied risk neutral disaster probability of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum, respectively. The
implied disaster probability ranges from 0 to 1.3 percent for Bitcoin, 0 to 2.5 percent for Ripple, and 0.4 to
1.6 percent for Ethereum. The current implied daily disaster probability is about 0.4 percent for Bitcoin,
0.6 percent for Ripple, and 0.3 percent for Ethereum.
Figure A.3: Implied Risk Neutral Disaster Probability

Appendix C: Portfolio Choice with Cryptocurrency
In this section, we ask the question: how much cryptocurrency an investor should hold in her portfolio? To
answer this question, we use the Black-Litterman model (Black and Litterman (1990, 1992)) and evaluate the
optimal portfolio problem. The variable notations used in this section are the same as in He and Litterman
(1999). We separately investigate incorporating Bitcoin into a portfolio with only stocks, a portfolio with
stocks and corporate bonds, and a portfolio with stocks, bonds and currency. Following He and Litterman
(1999), we assume a risk aversion parameter of 2.5. The coefficient of uncertainty in the prior estimate of
the mean, τ, is assumed to be 0.30 or 30% – a very conservative estimate reflecting the high volatility of
Bitcoin returns.
Table A.6 shows the correlation structure of Bitoin and other assets including stocks, coprorate bonds,
and currency. Table A.7 reports the standard deviations of the returns of the assets, market capitalization
shares, and CAPM implied equilibrium risk premiums.
The Black-Litterman model allows us to incorporate different investor views into the portfolio allocation
problem. We investigate a range of investor views and their effect on the allocation of Bitcoin. The different
investor views we examine are (1) Bitcoin will outperform the rest of the assets by 30 percent a year, (2)
Bitcoin will outperform the rest of the assets by 50 percent a year, (3) Bitcoin will outperform the rest of the
assets by 100 percent per year, and (4) Bitcoin will outperform the rest of the assets by 200 percent a year.
Historically, Bitcoin has been outperforming the rest of the assets by about 200 percent a year. Across the
different portfolios we considered, the shares of Bitcoin under the different investor views are similar. The
22

investor should have about 1 percent, 1.6 percent, 3.1 percent, and 6.1 percent share of Bitcoin under views
(1), (2), (3), and (4), respectively. That is, if the investor believes Bitcoin will continue to do as well as the
past seven years, she should hold about 6.1 percent share of Bitcoin in her portfolio. Even if the investor
believes Bitcoin will only have half of its historical performance going forward, she should still hold about
3.1 percent share of Bitcoin in her portfolio.
