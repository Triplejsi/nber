The Real Exchange Rate, Employment, and Output in
Manufacturing in the U.S. and Japan

ABSTRACT
In the spring of 1981 the U.S. dollar began a four—year period of
real appreciation that took it to a peak of more than 50 percent by first
quarter 1985. Since then, the dollar has depreciated substantially, but
remains above its 1980 level. During the same period, the Japanese yen
first depreciated by 12 percent in real terms from 1981 to 1982, and then
appreciated by some 30 percent to 1986. These swings in real exchange rates
effects on the relative competitiveness of U.S. and Japanese industry, and
have effects on employment and output in sectors producing tradeable goods.
This paper presents estimates of these effects.
Using time series data for the period 1970 to 1986, we use a simple
model of supply and demand to estimate the impact of swings in the effective
real. exchange rate of the dollar and the yen on manufacturing employment
and output In the U.S. and Japan, disaggregated by industry sectors, and
by production and non—production workers in the case of the U.S. employment.
These results are part of a larger research project to estimate the effects
of the movements in the real exchange rate on world manufacturing industries.

We find significant and substantial effects of the dollar appreciation on employment and output in U.S. manufacturing. In particular,
we find that exchange rate movements have had important effects on the
durable goods sectors, including primary metals, fabricated metal products,
and non—electrical machinery. Other sectors that suffer large employment
and output losses when the dollar appreciates are Stone, clay and glass
products, transportation, instruments, and chemicals. Estimates are also
presented for non—production and production workers in the U.S. employment
of the latter is more sensitive to the real exchange rate, especially in
the durable goods sectors. This suggests the possibility of hysteresis
in trade.
For Japan, we find significant effects of movements in the yen on
employment and output in the durable goods sectors, especially those
producing machinery. In particular, yen appreciation causes substantial
losses in employment and output in fabricated metal products, general
machinery, and electrical machinery. The results for Japan are not as
clear as for the U.S., perhaps because we have only annual data for
Japan, but quarterly data for the U.S.. Nevertheless, the importance
of movements In the real exchange rate for employment and output in
manufacturing is evident in both cases.

THE REAL EXCHANGE RATE, EMPLOYMENT, AND OUTPUT IN MANUFACTURING

IN THE U.S. AND JAPAN

I.

Introduction and Summary
In the spring of 1981 the U.S. dollar began a four-year period of

real appreciation that took it to a peak of more than 50 percent by first

quarter 1985. Since then, the dollar has depreciated substantially, but
remains above its 1980 level. The causes for this movement are described
in Branson (1985). During the same period, the Japanese yen first
depreciated by 12 percent in real terms from 1981 to 1982, and then
appreciated by some 30 percent to 1986. These swings in real exchange
rates have effects on the relative competitiveness of U.S. and Japanese
industry, and would be expected to influence employment and output in
sectors producing tradeable goods. This paper presents estimates of these
effects.

Using time series data for the period 1970 to 1986, we use a simple
model of supply and demand to estimate the impact of swings in the
effective real exchange rate of the dollar and the yen on manufacturing
employment and output in the U.S. and Japan, disaggregated by industry
sectors, and by production and non-production workers in the case of U.S.

2

employment. These results are part of a larger research project to
estimate the effects of movements in the real exchange rate on world
manufacturing industries.

Section II of the paper provides a brief theoretical background for

the estimation procedure. In section III we discuss the estimating
equation and the data. Section IV presents the basic results for U.S.

employment and output at the 2-digit level of manufacturing. In section
V we present the estimates for non-production and production workers in
the U.S., and find that employment of the latter is more sensitive to the

real exchange rate, especially in the durable goods sectors. This raises
the possibility of hysteresis in trade. In section VI we present the
results for employment and output for Japan.

We find significant and substantial effects of the dollar

appreciation on employment and output in U.S. manufacturing. In
particular, we find that exchange rate movements have had important
effects on the durable goods sectors, including primary metals,

fabricated metal products, and non-electrical machinery. Other sectors
that suffer large employment and output losses when the dollar
appreciates are stone, clay, and glass products, transportation,

instruments, and chemicals. We also find especially significant effects
on production workers.

For Japan, we find significant effects of movements in the yen on
employment and output in the durable goods sectors, esprcially those

producing machinery. In particular, yen appreciation causes substantial
losses in employment and output in fabricated metal products, general

3

machinery, and electrical machinery. The results for Japan are not as
clear as for the U.S., perhaps because we have only annual data for
Japan, but quarterly data for the U.S. Nevertheless, the importance of
movements in the real exchange rate for employment and output in
manufacturing is evident in both cases.

II. Theoretical Outline

In this section we sketch the theoretical basis for the estimating

equations. The discussion is brief, as the basic ideas are well known
from trade and computable general equilibrium (CGE) models that

distinguish three sectors: exportables X, import-competing goods M, and
non-traded goods N. We employ this sectorization for two reasons.
First, to study output and employment effects, we must focus on
exportables and import-competing production, rather than on trade in

exports and imports. Second, given this focus, we must provide a minimum
model of the non-traded sector the economy to ensure consistency.

The general line of the analysis can be stated simply. In each of
the three sectors, demand is sensitive to the relative price of home and

foreign goods. In the short run at least, we assume that a change in the
nominal exchange rate E moves that relative price, which we interpret as
the "real" exchange rate e

EP*/P, where p(p*) is the relevant home

(foreign) price. It is important to note the limiting force of this

assumption. If we were to assume that exportables and import-competing
goods were perfect substitutes in demand for foreign goods, then a change

4

in the nominal rate E would have no effect on the relative price e, since

*
*
eP and P = eP

*.

,

where P is the relevant home (foreign) price.

Even in this case, in the short run we would see a change in the relative

price of non-traded goods when E changes. In the long run, as wages
adjust to the change in goods prices, a cost-based model of pricing in
the non-traded goods sector would result in the restoration of the

original relative price in that sector. The change in P would be equal
to the initial change in E, in percentage terms. A rational-expectations
model with instantaneous market-clearing would collapse in this long run
into the short run, leaving no effect of E on e in any of the three

sectors. We do not assume perfect substitution or instantaneous marketclearing in the empirical work, but rather assume that changes in the
nominal rate move the real exchange rates of the U.S. and Japan in the
short run, and attempt to estimate the consequences.

An appreciation of the home currency, reducing e, reduces the

relative price of foreign to home goods. This tends to shift demand from
home to foreign goods, reducing output and employment in all three

producing sectors. Changes in home and foreign real income, Y and
respectively, also enter the demand for exportables, while we assume that
only home income Y is relevant for importables and non-traded goods.
On the supply side, we assume that the output of each sector depends

on its price relative to the nominal wage. As the real product wage

falls, supply increases. We do not attempt to model inter-sectoral
supply reactions as relative prices change, given the common nominal wage

5

rate. The supply functions below should, in theory, contain all relative
prices.

In the theoretical background to our empirical work, then, is a
model of supply and demand in each of the three sectors with supply
sensitive to the product wage, and demand sensitive to the relative price
of home and foreign goods and the relevant income variable.

A log-

linear model of demand and supply of exportables is described below, with
analogous results for import-competing goods and non-tradeables.

Exyortables
The demand for exportables is written in log-linear form as:

(1) ln Q ln c1 + d

ln (EP*/P) +

g1

ln Y +

g2

in Y.

Here Q is the quantity demanded, EP*/P is the relative price of
exportables and foreign goods, and y(y*) is home (foreign) real income.

The parameter d is the positive price elasticity of demand, and the g's
are the income elasticities. The supply of exportables is assumed to be
an inverse function of the product wage:

(2) in Q =

in

c2 +

s

in(P/W).

Here W is the nominal wage rate and s is the price eiasticity of suppiy.

As P/W increases Q supplied increases.

6

The demand and supply equations (1) and (2) can be solved to obtain

and P, give E,

the "reduced form" expressions for

W, Y, and Y'.

The solution for Q, the output of exportables, is given by:

s

S+d

[g1 mY + g2lnY*],

is the constant term.

Both coefficients in the reduced form are positive, given the way d was
defined in equation (1). An appreciation of the home currency, expressed

*
as the fall in the exchange rate E, reduces competitive prices EP

relative to domestic costs W, reducing Q. Growth in Y or y* increases
demand and production.

The estimating equations in sections IV-VI below follow (3). The
*
real exchange rate EP /W is inverted in those equations, since the data

use the inverse IMF definition of the exchange rate. This makes the
estimated coefficients for the real exchange rate negative. The domestic
income variable is broken into trend and cyclical components, to attempt
to identify a cyclical output elasticity.

The equation for employment N in the exportable sectors takes the
same form as the output equation, with the two tied by a production

function. If the production function is Q=Q(N,K), with the capital stock
K fixed in the short run, variations in output are given by dQ = Q

dN,

where Q is the marginal product of labor. Then the employment equation
in variation terms would be the output equation (3) divided by Q, which

7

is positive. Since all the estimated equations below have a separate
trend term, differential productivity growth trends across sectors are

included in the controlled variable set. The employment equations are

the same as the output equations with in N replacing in

on the left-

hand side of the equation (3).

Imort-Cometing and Non-Traded Goods
The basic demand and supply equations for import-competing and nontraded goods will have exactly the same form as (1) and (2) for
exportables, so the quantity solutions will have the same form as (3).
For both sectors we will eliminate the foreign output variable from the
demand function, although in principle it (and many others) should be

included. In both sectors supply is again an inverse function of the
product wage, and demand depends on the price of own output relative to
*

competing foreign goods, represented in general by EP .

*

As EP rises, we

expect substitution towards both domestic production of import-competing
goods and non-traded output, and vice-versa as EP* falls, that is, the
home currency appreciates.

Again, in principle we should include all product wages in each
supply function, to catch supply-side substitution as any relative price

changes. And, we should include all relative prices in each demand
function for a similar reason. In the empirical work, we focus on the
exogenous event of a major swing in E, producing a swing in the real

exchange rate. The maintained hypothesis expressed in the exclusion of

8

the other relative prices is that there was no significant exogenous
shift amongst them during the sample period, or that shifts over time are

captured by a trend variable. The obvious exception is the energy price,
which is included explicitly in the empirical work.
*

With Y excluded from the demand functions, and m and n subscripts
denoting import-competing and non-traded output and price, respectively,
the reduced-form solutions for

and Q are equation (3) with no term in

y* and the subscripts on the elasticities altered appropriately. The
employment equations, again, are similar to the output equations via a

production function. Trend terms will adjust for differences in
productivity growth across sectors. The presumed difference in demand
substitution against foreign goods among exportable, import-competing,
and non-traded goods should come out in the estimated values of the
demand elasticities, d , d

III. The Model to be Estimated

In the following sections we report the empirical estimates of the
relationship between movements in the real exchange rate and employment

and output in manufacturing in the U.S. and Japan. We take the
manufacturing sector to represent both import-competing and exportable

goods. Inital estimates for non-traded goods for the U.S. are reported
in Branson and Love (1986, Table 2). For the U.S., employment within the
manufacturing sector is disaggregated by the 20 industries defined by the
Standard Industrial Classification [SICJ system, and output is measured

9

by the index of industrial production. For Japan, employment and real
value added are disaggregated into 13 manufacturing sectors in the

national accounts datd. We have not modeled each industry within the
manufacturing sector individually, taking into account the special

sectoral demand shocks and cost effects that may be important. A general
reduced form model is applied to all manufacturing sectors.

The left-hand dependent variables are the natural logarithms of
employment and output. The right-hand independent variables include a
constant, three variables to capture secular, cyclical and structural

changes in demand, and the real exchange rate. The secular variable is
time [TREND]. For the U.S., the cyclical variable is the natural
logarithm of the national unemployment rate [LTJRT]. For Japan, the

cyclical variable is a constructed series of deviations from trend in
real GNP. Details on its construction are given in an Appendix. Inclusion
of these variables in the estimating equation is meant to catch the

effect of fluctuations in aggregate demand. The coefficients of the real
exchange rate therefore give the distributive effects of exchange-rate

movements adjusted for cyclical movements in total demand. These
coefficients are the effects of relative price changes of traded and nontraded goods, compensated for income effects.

The structural variable is the natural logarithm of an index to

measure the real price of energy [LRENGY]. For the U.S., this is the
ratio of the energy component of the CPI to the total CPI. For Japan, it
is an index of the dollar price of petroleum times the yen-dollar
exchange rate divided by the Japanese GNP deflator. This variable is

10

meant to catch the effects of shifts of energy costs on employment and

output by sector. The net effects of a given change in the real exchange
rate is therefore the coefficient of the exchange rate plus the
coefficient of the relative energy price times the effect of the movement

of the exchange rate on the energy price. The exchange rate variables
are the natural logarithms of indexes that measure the real U.S. and

Japanese trade-weighted exchange rate [LREX].1 The exchange rate used
here is the IMF index of relative unit labor costs. We considered the
inclusion of a foreign demand variable, but found that deviations from
trend growth in foreign demand were so highly correlated with changes in
domestic demand in the case of the U.S. that no additional explanatory

power came from foreign demand.2 We have not yet experimented with a

foreign demand variable in the case of Japan. The form of the estimating
equation for the U.S. is

the stochastic error term,

and the A's are the parameters to be estimated. The estimating equation
for Japan has the same form, but with only one lag at most, because the
Japanese data are annual, while the U.S. are quarterly.

11

The U.S. equations are estimated over a period that ends in the

first quarter of l986. In most cases the equations were estimated over
the periods beginning at first quarter 1970. Longer and shorter time

periods were tested and are reported in Branson and Love (1987). The
1970:1 to 1986:1 estimates have 65 observations and 46 degrees of
freedom. The Japanese equations are estimated over the period 1970 to
1985. These estimates have 15 observations and 12 degrees of freedom.

For the U.S., the exchange rate variable LREX includes the current

observation plus six quarters of lagged observations. The real energy
price LRENGY and the unemployment rate LUR.T variables both include the

current value plus four quarters of lags. For Japan, LREX and LRENGY are
entered into the equation with a one-period lag. Since the Japanese data
are annual, it is likely that last year's LREX and LRENCY affect this
year's employment and output. We attempted to separate trend from cycle

in real GNP in Japan, as described in the Appendix. But the estimated
coefficients of the cycle variable were generally insignificant and

frequently negative. Since we found that simply using actual real GNP
did not worsen the results, we report estimates below that use real GNP

instead of separate trend and cycle variables for Japan. For the U.S.,
the numbers we report are the sums of the coefficients on the lag
distributions and the test statistics on these sums. For Japan, single
coefficients and their t-ratios are reported.

The coefficient for the TREND variable (t) in the U.S. equations is
the estimated exponential rate of growth or decline in employment or

12

output that occurs due to secular changes in income, tastes, comparative
advantage, or technology. For the U.S., a coefficient for TREND of -.001
means that, holding everything else constant, the dependent variable will
decline at the percentage rate of 0.1 percent each quarter.

The coefficients for the real exchange rate, the real price of
energy, and the unemployment rate for the U.S. and real CNP for Japan can
be interpreted as elasticities, since the equations are estimated in log-

linear form. For example, a coefficient of - .3 for the real exchange
rate variable LREX in an employment equation means that a 10 percent
increase in the exchange rate will lead to a 3 percent decrease in the
number of workers employed.

For the U.S. equations, the source of the data on employment is the

Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) Employment and Earnings. The
employment variable here includes all workers, to be comparable to the
Japanese equations. Results for production vs non-production workers are
reported in Branson and Love (1987) for the 2-digit SIC manufacturing
sectors. The data on output are the Federal Reserve Board's indexes of
industrial production. The real exchange rate index is the IMF index of

relative unit labor costs.4 The real energy index is the CPI-Urban index
for energy divided by the CPI-Urban index for all consumer goods. The
unemployment rate is for all workers.5
For the Japanese equations, the data on employment and value-added
are taken from the Economic Planning Agency's National Accounts tables.
The other data are taken from the IMF's International Financial
Statistics data base. As for the U.S., the real exchange rate index for

13

Japan is the IMF index of relative unit labor costs. The relative energy
price was described above, and the cyclical variable is described in the
Appendix.

IV. Results for Employment and Output in the U.S.

Table 1 reports the results of the econometric estimates for total

employment in the twenty 2-digit SIC manufacturing sectors. It provides
the results from the equations that use "all workers" as the dependent

variable, estimated over the period 1970:1 to 1986:1. The table reports
the first order autocorrelation coefficient RHO, the coefficients for

each of the independent variables, and a significance statistic. When
independent variables are lagged, the coefficient represents the sum of

all lagged coefficients. The significance measure [SIC] is the
probability that the true value of the sum of the coefficients is zero,

using a two-tailed t-test. The standard error [SE] for the sum of the
exchange rate coefficients is also reported.
The RHO is positive and large for most of the sectors indicating a

high degree of serial correlation in employment.

The variable TREND is

positive for 12 of the industries, and statistically significant at the
.05 level in 16 of the regressions.

only primary metal industries [S1C32

Among the durable goods sectors,
and miscellaneous [39] had negative

trend terms over the sample period. The cyclical variable LURT measures

the impact of cyclical movements in the national economy; the predicted
sign for this variable is negative, as high sectoral employment is

14

associated with lower national unemployment rates. In the regressions,
LURT is negative in all 20 sectors, and is significant at the .05 level
17 times.

The real price of energy variable LRENCY is positive 11 times, and

significant 8 times. The predicted sign of this variable is ambiguous.
An increase in the relative energy price increases cost in all sectors,

reducing employment. But some sectors produce outputs that substitute
for energy, or are inputs to energy-substitute products. In five of the
eight cases where this variable is statistically significant, the sign is
positive [SIC 28, 29, 31, 35 and 38].

The real exchange rate variable LREX is negative for 18 of the 20

sectors, and statistically significant at the .05 level 14 times. In 13
of the 14 sectors where the exchange rate coefficient is statistically
significant, the sign of the coefficient is negative, the sole exception

being print and publishing [SIC 27]. The exchange rate has its greatest
impact on primary metal industries [SIC 33], with an elasticity of -.57,

and non-electrical machinery [SIC 35], with an elasticity of -.41.
Fabricated metal industries [SIC 34], petroleum and coal products [SIC
29], stone, clay and glass products [SIC 32], and miscellaneous
manufacturing [SIC 39], all have elasticities grouped between -.25 and -

.30.

We observe somewhat smaller, but important, effects on textiles and

apparel [SIC 22 and 23], chemicals and allied products [SIC 28], rubber
and miscellaneous products [SIC 30], lumber and wood products [SIC 24)
transportation equipment [SIC 37], and instruments and related products
[SIC 38].

15

The LREX coefficients for food and kindred products [SIC 20],
tobacco manufactures [SIC 21], leather and leather goods [SIC 31],

furniture and fixtures [SIC 25], and electrical and electronic equipment

[SIC 36] are negative, but not statistically different from zero. Only
paper and allied products [SIC 26] and print and publishing [SIC 27] have
positive signs, and only the latter is statistically significant.
Table 2 reports the results of the econometric estimates for
industrial production in the U.S. at the two-digit level. It follows the
same format as Table 1, except that in Table 2 the dependent variable is
the log of industrial production in each sector. The variable TREND is
positive in 18 of the 20 sectors, and significantly so in 16 of the 18.
The only sector with a significant negative trend is leather and leather
goods [SIC 31]. This illustrates the generally upward trend in output in
U.S. manufacturing over the sample .period 1970-86.
The cyclical variable LURATE [the same as LIJRT in Table 1] enters

negatively in all 20 sectors, and is not significant only in apparel and
other textile products [SIC 23] and leather and leather goods [SIC 31].
This illustrates the cyclical nature of industrial production in U.S.

manufacturing. The real price of energy is significantly positive only in
leather and leather goods. It is significantly negative in 5 sectors:

chemicals [SIC 28], furniture [25], fabricated metal products [34],
stone, clay and glass products [32], and transporttation equipment [37].
The real exchange rate is negative in 15 of the 20 sectors, and the
coefficient is significant in 11 of the 15. Of the 5 positive
coefficients,only those for food [SIC 20] and print and publishing [27]

16

are significant. The results for industrial production are consistent
with those for employment, in that1there is no sector where the LREX
coefficient has different signs, both significant, in the two sets of
estimates. As in the employment estimates, primary metal industries [SIC
33] has the largest elasticity of industrial production with respect to
the exchange rate. A 50 percent real appreciation of the dollar reduces
industrial production in the sector by 27.5 percent. Among the other
durable goods sectors, instruments [SIC 38] stands out with a
substantially larger coefficient in the industrial production equation [-

0.41] than in the employment equation [-0.15].
Overall, the results confirm the sensitivity of employment and
output in U.S. manufacturing to changes in the real exchange rate. That
sensitivity is greater in the durable goods sectors than in non-durables,

as expected. Some puzzles remain, such as the positive coefficients in
the print and publishing sector, and the insignificant ones in the
electrical and electronic equipment sector. Print and publishing will
remain a puzzle, but the breakdown between production and non-production
workers will help us understand electrical and electronic equipment.

V. Production Workers and Non Production Workers

The empirical results presented in Section IV relate to total

employment in the U.S.. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also provides a
series for the employment of production workers. The complement of this
series, all workers minus the production workers, will be referred to

17

here as non-production workers. Production workers include employees who
are directly engaged in the physical processes of production of

manufactured goods--workers on assembly lines. The "non-production"
series includes workers who are involved in research and development,

marketing, transportation, secretarial and clerical tasks, and management
activities.

If the market structure is such that the industry has a fixed ratio
of production to non-production workers and if production and nonproduction workers are both domiciled in the United States, then a
movement in the real exchange rate would have the same percentage impact

on production and non-production workers. If, on the other hand, the
industry was characterized by increasing returns to scale or if the
results of the production workers' activities are more tradeable than is
the case for non-production workers, then exchange rate movements may
have much different impacts on the production and non-production workers.
In Tables 3 through 5 the two time series are compared. In Table 3
the estimated coefficients of our same estimating equation for production

workers are presented. The results for non-production workers are
presented in Table 4. The two sets of coefficients for the real exchange
rate are compared in Table 5. This table also shows the percentage change
in employment of the two types of worker in each sector estimated to be
due to the appreciation of the dollar from 1980 to 1985.

The comparison between the production and non-production worker
results in Table 5 shows that in fifteen of the twenty industries, the
difference between the LREX coefficients is greater than two standard

18

errors for the production worker series. Moreover, the signs of the
coefficients are different for 8 of the 20 industries.

Within the non-durable goods industries the results are mixed. For
half the industries, the exchange rate elasticities are more negative for

production workers than is the case for non-production workers. Within
the durable goods industries, the LREX coefficients are more negative in
nine of ten sectors, suggesting that production workers provide services
that are more tradeable than the services provided by non-production
workers. Indeed, for three durable goods industries- -electrical and
electronic equipment, transportation equipment, and instruments and
related products- -the coefficients are negative and statistically

significant for production workers, and positive and statistically

significant for non-production workers. Thus for the instruments and
related products industry, for example, the dollar appreciation from 1980
to 1985 is estimated to have caused a decrease of 11.3 percent for
production workers, but an increase of 3.5 percent for non-production

workers. Since the level of overall unemployment is controlled for in
the estimates, the relative increase in non-production workers is not
surprising.

These results suggest that a dollar appreciation may cause U.S.
firms to move production facilities out of the United States, thus

leading to a larger proportional reduction in production workers. This
may mean that the jobs will not return to the U.S. now that the real

value of the dollar has declined relative to foreign currencies. This

19

may also imply that to some extent our model may be mis-specified, due to
hysteresis effects.

Hysteresis reflects the dependence of present employment not only on
the levels of the independent variables, but also the path of those

variables over the past. Industries or sectors where hysteresis effects
may be important include industries where economies of scale or learning
by doing are important, and where there are "sunk" costs for R&D,
relocation, marketing efforts, capital investments, or other items that

could represent a strategic barrier to entry in a market. It may be that
once the initial costs of relocating production workers in foreign
countries have been incurred, it will not be cost-effective to relocate

the workers back in the U.S. after the dollar depreciates. Thus, while
our model is useful in decomposing the causes of the changes in
employment from 1980 to 1985, for some industries it may not be a good
predictor of the employment changes that will occur in the more recent
period of dollar depreciation.

VI. Results for Employment and Output in Japan

We now turn to the data for Japan. The annual data (1970-85) on
employment and value added for 13 manufacturing sectors are taken from
the Economic Planning Agency's Tables on national income, and were
provided by Richard Marston (1987), who used them to analyze the relative
competitiveness of the U.S. and Japan. The real exchange rate is the

IMF's relative unit labor cost for Japan. The real energy price is the

20

world price of petroleum in dollars, converted to yen using the yendollar exchange rate, expressed as a ratio to the GNP deflator. These
data are taken from the International Financial Statistics data base.
They enter the estimating equations in log form.

The Appendix describes our construction of a cyclical variable as

the deviation from trend in real GNP. A three-part equation for trend
real CNP was estimated to account for the break in the growth path of

real GNP after the 1973 oil price shock. Separation of real GNP into
trend and cycle components did not improve the results, however, so we

used just real CNP as a regressor. We also experimented with a variable
for real world imports, less Japan. This was collinear with Japanese
real GNP, and gave worse results when it was used as an alternative.

Since the data for Japan are annual, we do not estimate lag
distributions, but simply enter the current value for the log of real CNP
and the once-lagged values of the logs of the real exchange rate and the
real energy price. The dependent variables are the logs of employment and
output by sector. A list of the sectors, and their weights in real CDP is
given in Table 6.

The estimated equations for employment in manufacturing in Japan are

shown in Table 7. The format is slightly different from that of Tables

l4.6 Table 7, and Table 8 for output, show the coefficient for each
variable and its t-ratio as the significance test. Also shown are the the

adjusted

and the Durbin-Watson statistic. The equations in Tables 7

and 8 are not adjusted for serial correlation. This is done in Tables 9
and 10. Estimates are shown for each of the 13 sectors, for a machinery

21

aggregate that combines sectors 8 through 12, and for total
manufacturing.

The real GNP coefficients [LRGNP} in Table 7 represent a

combination of trend and cycle influences. For non-durables they are
mixed, with two significantly positive and two significantly negative.

For durables, only one is negative, and the two aggregates have

significantly positive real GNP coefficients. The real energy variable
is negative in all sectors except food and beverages, but significantly
so only in fabricated metal products [8] and electrical machinery [10].

The variable of direct interest here, LREX, shows a similar pattern

to the U.S. results. The signs are negative for all durable goods
sectors except transport equipment [11], and there the coefficient is

insignificant. The general machinery [9], electrical machinery [10], and
aggregate machinery [8-12] sectors all have significabtly negative

coefficients. A 20 percent appreciation of the yen reduces employment in
the electrical machinery sector by 12.6 percent, and in aggregate

machinery production by 5.6 percent. Thus movements in the real
effective yen exchange rate seem to have significant effects on
employment in the durable goods sectors within a year.

The results for output in manufacturing in Japan are shown in Table
8, which has the same format as Table 7. The positive coefficients of
real GNP for all sectors except petroleum and coal products [5] are
striking. Electrical machinery [10] shows an elasticity of 5.6 with

respect to GNP growth. The difference between the real GNP terms in

Tables 7 and 8 is a rough measure of productivity growth. As noted by

22

Marston (1987), productivity grew rapidly in the expanding sectors, with
electrical machinery in the lead, and fell slightly in food and beverages
[1] and petroleum and coal products [5]. The elasticity of productivity

in the machinery aggregate with respect to growth in real GNP is 2.3, on

these estimates. Marston (1987), who focussed directly on estimating
productivity growth, showed the same pattern across sectors, with an

average of 6 percent per year for the machinery aggregate. The real
energy price is generally negative, except in the petroleum and coal
products sector [51, where it is significantly positive, as expected.

The real exchange rate coefficients show more mixed results for

output than for employment. The fabricated metal [8] and general
machinery [9] sectors have very significant negative coefficients, as do
both aggregates. The marginally insignificant coefficient for electrical
machinery [10] is puzzling, given its highly significant negative value

in the enployment regressions. Why would appreciation reduce employment
significantly more than output in the electrical machinery sector?
The large negative coefficient for LREX in the equation for the
machinery aggregate implies a larger elasticity of output in response to

changes in the real exchange rate in Japan than in the U.S. In Table 2,
the largest of the estimates in the group SIC 34-38 is -0.41 in
instruments [SIC 38], where in Table 8, it is -0.60 for the machinery
aggregate. The remaining puzzle is why the disaggregated machinery
sectors 10-12 do not show greater sensitivity of output to the exchange

rate, given the estimate for the aggregate. Marston (1987) suggests that
this is due to absorption of exchange rate changes in profits. but he

23

shows this effect in the machinery sector to be greatest in general

machinery [9], which has the largest negative coefficient in Table 8. So
while we find significant effects of changes in the real exchange rate on
output in the durable goods sectors in Japan, the pattern of coefficients
across sectors remains somewhat puzzling.

The Durbin-Watson statistics in Tables 7 and 8 indicate substantial
serial correlation in the error terms, especially in the employment
equations for durables. So all the regressions were re-estimated using
alternatively the Cochrane-Orcutt adjustment for serial correlation and a

lagged dependant variable to reflect partial adjustment.7 The serial

correlation results are presented in Tables 9 and 10. The results with
the lagged dependant variable, represented by LY(-l), are shown in Tables
11 and 12.

Comparing the employment estimates in Tables 9 and 11, we see that
the lagged dependant variable performs better than the serial
correlation correction. With the exceptions of sectors 1-3 [food,
textiles, and paper], the serial correlation RHO coefficients in Table 9
are all significantly positive, as are the lagged dependant variables in
Table 11, with the further exception of sector 13 [miscellaneous]. But
the Table 11 equations fit better and have Durbin-Watson statistics
closer to 2 than the Table 9 equations. Thus the evidence favors the

partial adjustment model for employment in Japan.8 The coefficients for
the real exchange rate and the relative energy price in the employment
equations for sectors 4-12 in Table 11 should be interpreted as
representing one-year adjustment. The long-run coefficients can be

24

obtained by dividing these by one minus the coefficient of the lagged

dependant variable. In Table 11, the exchange rate coefficients for the
durable sectors and the two aggregates are uniformly negative, as are
those for the energy price in all sectors but food.

The evidence is less clear in the output equations in Tables 10 and

12. Both the RHO and the coefficients of the lagged dependant variables
are smaller than those for employment, and most often insignificant. The
adjusted R2 and D statistics are about the same in the two tables. The
real exchange rate coefficients in the fabricated metal and machineryproducing sectors [8-10] are large and negative in both tables. In Tables
10 and 12, the output elasticity with respect to LREX in the electrical
machinery sector [10] is larger than the employment elasticity in Tables
9 and 11, providing a possible dynamic explanation of the apparent puzzle

from Tables 7 and 8. With the serial correlation correction in Table 10,
the output elasticity with respect to LREX of - .44 for the machinery

aggregate is closer to the estimate from the U.S. data in Table 2. In
Table 12, this elasticity is - .33 in one year, and - .50 in the long run.
These bracket the elasticity of SIC 38 in the U.S. estimates.
With only 15 annual observations in this data set, further
exploration of the dynamics of adjustment in manufacturing in Japan would
be inconclusive.

It does appear that lagged adjustment of employment is

supported more strongly by the data than lagged adjustment of output.

This is consistent with employment-smoothing in Japan. The pattern of
coefficients for the real exchange rate in Tables 7-12 for Japan is
broadly similar to that in Tables 1-2 for the U.S., with negative

25

coefficients for durables, and mixed results for non-durables. Thus,

while the dynamic specification is still not precise, the results for
Japan show sensitivities of employment and output in manufacturing to the
real exchange rate that are not unlike those of the U.S.

1. The IMF defines the exchange rate as the inverse of EP*/W from
Section II. An increase of the index is an appreciation of the home
currency.

2. We further considered the inclusion of a real interest rate variable, but
found, surprisingly, that it had little explanatory power, and did not

significantly change the estimated exchange rate elasticities. The lack of
explanatory power may be due to mulitcolinarity between the interest rate
variable and the three variables TREND, LURT, and LRENGY.

3. The Beach-Mackinnon (1978) maximum likelihood procedure for
correcting first order autocorrelation was used in estimating the U.S.

equations. The Cochrane-Orcutt procedure was used for the Japanese
equations.

4. In an early version of this paper [Branson and Love (1986)] we used a six
country index of exchange rates deflated by consumer prices. We have also
experimented with an index based wholesale prices and we have used different

weighing methods for the countries in the index. In general, changes in the
country weights or the price deflators have changed the metric of the

estimates, but not the ranking of the coefficients. The index based on unit
labor costs tends to fit the data better that indexes based on wholesale or
consumer prices.

5. Detrending of the unemployment rate to account for secular changes in labor
force participation rates [a higher "natural rate"] changes the estimated
coefficient for the LURT variable and the TREND variable, but does not change
the other coefficients.

28

6. The regressions reported in Tables 1-4 were performed on a PC using
the GAUSS package, but the regressions reported in Tables 7 and 8 were
performed on the Unisys at the IMF.

7. The same tests on the U.S. equations yielded long-run coefficients for
the real exchange rate with the lagged dependant variable that were equal
to the sums of the six-quarter lags reported in Tables 1-4. Thus in the
U.S. case, the evidence supported the serial correlation correction, once
a 6-quarter lag was introduced.
8. We attempted to test the two alternatives by adding lagged values of
the independant variables to the regressions, but the results were mixed
and inconclusive. With 13 observations and 7 regressors, degrees of
freedom become insufficient to obtain clear results.

9. In collaboration with Richard Marston, we are now working with a
monthly data set to explore the dynamics of adjustment in Japan more
thoroughly.

Appendix: Trend and Cycle in Japan

The path of real GNP in Japan is shown as the solid line in

Figure A—i. The break in the trend in 1973—74 following the oil price
increase is clear. It appears that the growth path both shifted down
and decreased in slope. It also appears that the growth paths before
1973 and after 1974 are approximately linear. To compute trend and
cycle variables for Japan, we fitted a piece—wise linear regression to
the real GNP time series from 1968 to 1986, using two time trends,
one (TIM 1) for 1968—73, and one (TIM 2) for 1975—86, and two dummy

variables. DUN 1 is unity in 1974 and zero otherwise, and DUN 2 is zero
for 1968—74 and unity for 1975—86. The regression, including a constant
term, is summarized in Table A—i. The fitted values from the regression
are shown as the dashed line in Figure A—i. The cyclical variable LCYC
in the regressions for Japan in section VI is the series of residuals

from the regression in percentage terms; the trend variable is the log of
the fitted value.
