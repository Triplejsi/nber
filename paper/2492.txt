Investment Tax Incentives and Frequent Tax Reforms

ABSTRACT

Despite the frequency of tax changes and their potential importance to
investors, almost all of the analysis of tax—based investment incentives

assumes investors never anticipate any tax changes. We depart from this
approach by analyzing the historical pattern of U.S. corporate investment
incentives over the period 1953—86, Incorporating the feature of investor
awareness that the tax code may change.

Our analysis incorporates a predictive equation for future tax variables
into a model of optimal investment subject to adjustment costs and

uncertainty. We find that expectations of future tax changes significantly
affect the incentive to Invest only if adjustment costs are low. [n this
case, the incentive to invest in 1986 was strong, as investors are estimated
to have anticipated the coming reduction in investment incentives.

In the uncertain business of planning for U.S. corporate investment, one
of the few reliable forecasts one can make is that the tax law will change

before any new investment outlives its usefulness. While the Tax Reform Act of
1986 mandates an unusually dramatic reform in the structure of business
taxation and the incentive to invest, the simple fact that Congress chose to
alter in 1986 the tax treatment of new investments is hardly surprising.
Earlier in the 1980s Congress changed investment incentives with new tax
legislation in 1981, 1982, 1984 and 1985, and over the period 1953—1985 made
such changes in 16 different years.
The willingness, indeed eagerness, of the U.S. government to amend the
rate at which it taxes new investments seems likely to have substantial

consequences for investor incentives. By far the bulk of an investor's return
comes in years subsequent to the year in which new plant and equipment is put

in place. Tax reforms affect investor returns not only by changing the amount
of money owed the government, but also by encouraging or discouraging competing
future investment and thereby changing levels of before-tax future earnings.

For example, the knowledge that Congress plans to introduce a large investment
tax credit in two years seems likely to depress investment this year and next,
since the investment wave two years hence will be expected to drive down the
return to any capital already in place when it starts.

Despite the frequency of tax changes and their potential importance to
investors, almost all of the analysis of tax-based investment incentives

follows the seminal work of Dale Jorgenson (1963) in assuming investors never

to anticipate any tax changes. Recent examples include Alan Auerbach (1983)
and Mervyn King and Don Fullerton (1984).. The U.S. Treasury Department in its
tax reform proposal (1984) analyzed investment incentives in each year of its

phased-in reform package under the assumption that investors never anticipate

the sequence of tax changes that is explicitly part of the reform. In this

-2—

paper, we depart from this approach by analyzing the historical pattern of U.S.
corporate investment incentives over the period 1953-1986, incorporating the
feature of investor awareness that next year's tax code may not be the same as
this year's.

I. Anticipated Tax Reforms
In order to analyze the impact of expected future tax changes it is
necessary to understand over which tax variables investors form expectations.
The tax law as written contains thousands of provisions affecting corporate

investment. Even restricting attention just to the statutory tax rate, the
investment tax credit, and the present value of depreciation allowances leaves
a problem of great complexity, since Congressional choice of the level of one
variable is surely conditioned by the chosen levels of the others.

There is, furthermore, a relevant issue of the extent to which the

government's "choice" of a particular tax variable is truly volitional. In
roughly half of the postwar years the government did not make substantial

legislative changes in any of the three variables listed. Yet even without
specific Congressional action, the ex ante value of depreciation allowances

available on new investments varies from year to year with movements in

expected inflation and real interest rates. And while these movements
automatically affect the level of investment tax incentives, they also are
likely to be correlated with changes in general economic conditions, such as

unemployment or GNP growth. Hence it may be the case that during periods of no
tax changes Congress was actually permitting automatic features of the tax

system to set investment incentives at acceptable levels. Or it could be that
-

in

the years in which no new tax laws appeared Congress would have chosen to

set tax rates at different levels, but was for some reason prevented from
making any changes that year.

—3—

In order to model anticipations of future tax reforms, we assume investors

to expect tax changes based on a model of government choice in which the
government reveals its desired tax levels only in those years that it enacts

new tax laws. Thus, the 16 years in which the corporate tax law changed over
the period 1953-1985 afford us 16 glimpses of the outcome of the government's

desired tax function. We take the probability that a new tax law will be
enacted to be exogenous. (This is a very simple and perhaps inadequate
specification; we are currently pursuing work based on alternative

assumptions.) If no new law appears then of course the pre-existing tax law
applies to new investments, with possibly new incentives due to changes in
inflation and interest rates.

There still remains the issue of specifying the particular future tax

variable investors predict when making their decisions. Following Jorgenson
(1963) and subsequent authors,- we assume that a firm expecting no future tax

changes will set its marginal product of capital equal to
q(p+ô) .

(14-tz)

where q is the relative price of capital goods, p is the real discount rate, '5
i-s the geometric rate of economic depreciation, k is the investment tax credit,

t is the corporate tax rate and z is the present value of depreciation

allowances per dollar invested. The cost of capital, then, is directly
affected by the ratio (l—k-tz)/(1-u), and it is this ratio which we assunie

Congress to peg in making its tax choices.

This choice of tax specification raises an issue that bears on the
appropriateness of different sample periods for estimating the government's

choice function. This model embodies the assumption that changes in the
statutory tax rate, t, apply only to new investments. Of course this is not
the case, but in defense of our procedure, the statutory corporate tax rate

-4-

changed infrequently over the period 1953-1985, and moved very little when it

moved at all: it ranged from a high of 52.8% to a low of 46%. The Tax Reform
Act of 1986 departed widely from this pattern by introducing a phased reduction
of the statutory rate to 34%, and for that reason we leave 1986 out of our
estimating sample.

Denoting the ratio (1-k-tz)/(l-t) for aggregate corporate investment in

year t by Tax (with z calculated using an assumed real interest rate of 4
percent and static inflation expectations) we estimated several equations with
explanatory variables suggested by our view of the factors likely to affect

policy choices. The best fit was obtained with the following equation:

(1) Tax = 1.90
(0.16)

-

0.045 UNEM - 0.021 YGRO - 0.017 REALR - 1.94 IGNP
(.006)

(.004)

(.004)

(.89)

n=16, R .88, SEEO.036
where liNEN is the unemployment rate, YGRO is the real growth rate of GNP from

the previous year, RER is the real interest rate on short-term commercial
paper (using the GNP deflator to measure inflation), and IGNP is the ratio of

real investment to GNP. Standard errors are in parentheses.
Even allowing for the small number- of degrees of freedom all the variables

except the last are significant at a 95% confidence level, and IGNPtI fails

the 95% text only just barely. Equation (1) is characterized by a surprisingly
good fit for a time series regression with a nontrending dependent variable,
and in fact (I) predicts, out of sample, a tax reform in 1986 very similar to

the change Congress enacted (see below). Coefficients on the unemployment and
real interest rates indicate that investment incentives are set in a

countercyclical manner. Neither current nor lagged inflation entered significantly in (1), indicating that Congress set tax rules with a view toward undoing

the effects of changing inflation rates. However, the remaining coefficients
have the "wrong" sign for that interpretation - and the whole notion of

—5—

"countercyclical" tax policy using investment incentives has been questioned by
Robert Lucas (1976), and by Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott (1977), who
specifically discussed the impact on private behavior of government attempts to
use the investment tax credit as a stabilization tool.

II. Model
In order to analyze the impact of current tax changes and anticipated
future tax reforms on investment incentives, it is necessary to construct a

model of dynamic firm behavior. In particular, one must pay close attention to
the specification of the costs firms face as they vary their investment levels.
It seems quite reasonable empirically to employ a model in which rapid
adjustment is costly, but the introduction of adjustment costs introduces a
number of complications.
For our purpose in this paper we employ a discrete-time variant of the

model analyzed in Auerbach (1986). We assume the firm to maximize the expected
present value of its after-tax cash flows:

(2)

Vt =

E[a(1+r)

—(

—

(1—t

)

—

p(1+½$I)I(1_k_r)}tAJ

where

is the expectations operator at time t, r is the nominal discount

rate,

is the statutory tax rate at time s, p is the price level for output

at time s, and F() is the firm's production function which exhibits decreasing

returns with respect to capital, K. (One can also interpret F() as a reduced
form of a constant returns production function with levels of other factors

chosen optimally.) The parameter •

reflects

investment adjustment costs, which

are assumed to be capitalized and depreciated for tax purposes. k is the
-

investment tax credit available in period s, while I is the present value of
future depreciation allowances times future statutory tax rates (hence Itz if
r

is

expected to be constant). At is predetermined (though perhaps uncertain)

—6—

in year t; it is the value of financial attributes (such as future depreciation
allowances on old investments) the firm cannot affect.
Maximization of (2) over the choice of investment (and hence the capital
stock) in each year yields a first order condition that (assuming that r, 6,

and the inflation rate /p are small), can be approximated by:
E

F'(K )(1-t )
=

(3)
1_kt_Ft

(Pô)

A[q (1-k -F )I

÷
l-kt-Ft

in which p=r-/p is the real discount rate,

is the pre-tax marginal cost of

an additional piece of capital (inclusive of adjustment costs) relative to the
price of output, and the operator A denotes changes from one year to the next.
If the second term on the right side of (3) were zero, so that investors expect

no changes in the after-tax relative price of new capital between this year and
next, then the formula implies that the after-tax cost of capital is exactly
the same as that cost which emerges in the standard Jorgenson (1963)-type
framework.

But in general investors will not expect the change in [q(1-k-r)] to be
zero from year to year. The after-tax marginal cost of capital will be
expected to change either through tax changes, or through changes in investment

levels which affect marginal adjustment costs. And naturally the level of
investment is itself a function of current and expected future tax policy.

Hence a consistent analysis of forward-looking investment tax incentives should
incorporate not only the tax treatment of current investments, but also the

effect of the tax law on the current level of marginal adjustment costs and
expected changes in marginal adjustment costs.

Following Auerbach (1986), it is possible to derive a fairly simple
expression for the combined effect of taxes on marginal investment incentives.

(Details are available from the authors on request.) Doing so requires some

—7—

approximations, such as linearizing the model around steady-state values of
investment and the capital stock, and it also requires a specification of the

nature of anticipated tax changes. For the purposes of this solution we assume
investors to anticipate that the government will introduce (potentially) new

values of (k+r) at some date, but are uncertain about the timing of their

adoption. That is, investors at time t

observe

current tax parameters and also

form expectations of the values the parameters would take in a tax reform

package, and investors anticipate the probability of passage of a reform
measure to be constant at a rate it

per

year. Investors expect the tax reform,

once adopted, to be the true final resting spot for the tax system, with no
further tax changes to follow.

Given this specification of the model, the cost of capital that determines
the capital stock takes the form (suppressing subscripts):
(4)

q [th+o)cl-k-r) +

ack+r)

_________

l-t

where (1+X) is the unstable root of the second-order difference

equation

describing the evolution of the capital stock in response to tax changes. X

lies in the interval [(p+ó), ) and approaches infinity as adjustment costs
vanish. Use of (4) permits changes in the cost of capital to be decomposed
neatly into two pieces: the first term, which is standard (see expression (1)
above) and the second term, which is the effect of future tax changes through it

and

the average value that tax variables are expected to take.

The cost of decomposing investor incentives in this way is that the model

we use is somewhat stylized. Investors expect the statutory tax rate not to
change, and anticipate any future changes in k and r to be permanent. This
permanent change is adopted at a constant hazard rate a. While none of these
assumptions is required in order to solve this model, their use greatly

simplifies the problem at little likely cost of changing the results. The same

—8—

evaluation

appears to apply to the specification of the adjustment cost

function in (2). Here a central issue is whether the cost of adjusting the
capital stock is properly specified as a function of the rate of investment, or

as a function of the rate of investment relative to the size of the capital

stock. Since a growing economy exhibits secular growth in the former, it may
be more reasonable to use the latter specification. Unfortunately, the
phenomenon of ratio adjustment costs requires a different measure of economic
depreciation from that commonly used (see Andrew Abel (1983) and Auerbach

(1986)). Auerbach (1986) and Auerbach and James Hines (1987) analyze
investment tax incentives with ratio adjustment costs. This complication would
make our calculations difficult to compare with other studies that ignore ad-

justment costs altogether. Therefore, we present results which emerge from the
model in (2) with level adjustment costs. Calculations performed with ratio
adjustment costs did not differ qualitatively from those reported in this
paper, and are available from the authors.

III. Results
It is convenient to summarize investment tax incentives with effective tax
rates, which measure marginal wedges between the gross and net of tax returns

to capital. In the case that the tax system is expected to change, this rate
may be interpreted as that constant tax rate on true economic income which
would yield the current level of investment (see Auerbach (1986)).

We measure

effective tax rates for aggregate nonresidential corporate

investment using

expression (4), with the expected tax change set to zero for

the case of myopic expectations. The calculations also require specification

of several parameters. We set ô=.0704 (based on calculations in Auerbach and
Hines (1987)), and p=.O4. For "high—adjustment-cost" simulations, we choose a
value of 4'

that,

when multiplied by the steady-state capital stock around which

the approximation is taken yields a marginal adjustment cost equal to that

—9—

imposed by a proportional adjustment cost model with a corresponding quadratic

parameter of 20. This choice implies extremely slow adjustment, but is
nonetheless somewhat lower than many empirical estimates (e.g. Lawrence Summers
(1981)). For "low-adjustment—cost" simulations, we set 4i to correspond to a

ratio adjustment cost parameter of .5. The root X depends on p, 6, $ and the
local elasticity of the marginal product of capital with respect to the capital

stock (details available on request). For this parameter, we use a value of
.65, which is reasonable given its interpretation in the Cobb-Douglas

production function as the labor share of gross output. This yields values for
A of .128 in the high-adjustment-cost case and .409 in the low-adjustment-cost
case.

Finally, we must specify the probability of change perceived by investors
and that tax system expected to be adopted if a change occurs. We consider two

specifications of probability. The "variable reform probability" sets each
year's probability to the fraction of the previous five years in which a tax
change occurred, while the "constant reform probability" specification sets
each year's probability to .5, the approximate fraction of sample years in

which taxes changed. In all simulations, the potential tax reform expected in
each year is that which equation (1) predicts given that year's economic
variables.

Table 1 summarizes our findings. The far left column presents effective
tax rates as conventionally measured, that is, under the assumptions of no

adjustment costs and no future changes in any relevant variables, including tax

variables. The next two columns present effective tax rates in the presence of
large adjustment costs, and while these rates are not identical to standard

measures of effective tax rates, the difference is quite small. This
similarity arises because future investment tax incentives are of little

importance to firms that feel locked into today's investments by steep costs of

-10-

varying their investment rates. Hence adjustment costs at the levels estimated
by some authors make anticipated tax policy unimportant to contemporary
investment decisions.

Columns four and five contain estimated effective tax rates in the

presence of low but nonzero adjustment costs. These estimates exhibit
considerably more variability than conventional effective tax rates, as
investors typically anticipate actual movements in investment incentives and
understand when changes come that the legislature often overshoots its mark.

Examples of these anticipations include the periods 1971—1973, 1980—1982, and
1984-1986.. The scenario with variable reform probabilities shows this effect
dramatically during periods such as the early 1970 and mid-1980s, when
rapid-fire tax reforms make investors very sensitive to the government's

desired policy since it is likely to be enacted soon. By 1986 investors we so
certain that a tax change was coming, and that the change would rob the tax
system of many of its investment incentives, that contemporaneous investment

incentives looked extremely attractive by comparison. (Although in the event
the investment tax credit was repealed retroactive to January 1, 1986.)

Much more research is necessary in order to identify the full impact of

anticipated tax reforms on investment incentives. Anticipations of future
economic conditions and government policy responses can be modelled in a richer
environment that incorporates nonstatic expectations, rational updating of
investors' anticipation function, and the endogeneity of future economic
variables

to tax changes. Anticipated tax policy would be likely to assume

more importance in a model that disaggregated investment by sector or by asset
•

type, since these breakdowns would capture the very large historical
differences and movements in the taxation of equipment and structures

investments. But even without a more detailed model, it is clear that
anticipated policy is important as long as investment is relatively flexible.
