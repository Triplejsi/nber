Per Capita Income, Consumption Patterns, and CO2 Emissions
Justin Caron and Thibault Fally
NBER Working Paper No. 24923
August 2018
JEL No. F18,O10,Q47,Q56
ABSTRACT
This paper investigates the role of income-driven differences in consumption patterns in
explaining and projecting energy demand and CO2 emissions. We develop and estimate a
general-equilibrium model with non-homothetic preferences across a large set of countries and
sectors, and trace embodied energy consumption through intermediate use and trade linkages.
Consumption of energy goods is less than proportional to income in rich countries, and more
income-elastic in low-income countries. While income effects are weaker for embodied energy,
we find a significant negative relationship between income elasticity and CO2 intensity across all
goods. These income-driven differences in consumption choices can partially explain the
observed inverted-U relationship between income and emissions across countries, the so-called
environmental Kuznet curve. Relative to standard models with homothetic preferences,
simulations suggest that income growth leads to lower emissions in high-income countries and
higher emissions in some low-income countries, with only modest reductions in world emissions
on aggregate.

Introduction

Energy consumption is associated with a number of negative externalities. Fossil fuel combustion,
in particular, leads to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) a greenhouse gas responsible for global
climate change. World energy consumption and emissions have been increasing almost constantly,
and understanding the determinants behind emission levels is necessary to guide policy making and
improve forecasting. At the same time, demand for energy — like that of most goods — varies
significantly across income levels. There is for example widespread expectation of a rapid increase in
energy consumption in emerging economies as households approach middle-income levels (Wolfram et
al., 2012). On the other hand, empirical evidence from high- and middle-income countries tends to
point the other way: rich households spend a smaller share of their income on energy. However, most
studies on the role of per capita income focus on a single country and do not examine implications for
multiple countries in general equilibrium.
This paper investigates how per capita income influences energy demand and CO2 emissions across
countries through differences in consumption patterns. We do so by introducing identical yet nonhomothetic (income-dependent) consumer preferences within a multi-regional, multi-sectoral generalequilibrium model which accounts for differences in technologies, input-output linkages and trade.
Our first objective is to estimate the extent to which per capita income influences the average energy
and CO2 intensity of consumption by systematically shifting consumption patterns towards more or
less energy-intensive goods. We find that consumption patterns contribute to the observed invertedU relationship between income and CO2 intensity, a variant of the Environmental Kuznets Curve
(EKC). The second objective is to estimate whether and how we can expect further growth in per
capita income to affect changes in emissions. Results indicate little scope for shifts in consumption
choices to single-handedly reduce the CO2 intensity of world GDP in the short run: while income
growth leads to lower emissions in many countries once we account for non-homothetic consumption,
weaker income effects for embodied energy and higher emissions in some low-income countries imply
modest world average effects.
Our framework allows a number of contributions. First, we paint an aggregate cross-country
picture of the relationship between income, consumption and emissions. A number of ’micro’ surveybased studies find that the household demand for energy varies systematically with income, but
only provide scattered, country-specific evidence (typically from high-income countries). Conversely,
’macro’ studies of the relationship between income and CO2 emissions across countries, such as EKC
studies, have not focused on the importance of consumption patterns. Global or regional emissions
projections exercises also often do not model non-homothetic preferences, implicitly assuming an
income elasticity of one. The second contribution is accounting for global input-output linkages. The
demand for energy goes well beyond direct consumption and a large share of emissions is “embodied”
in the consumption of non-energy goods. As incomes rise, the evolution of emissions depends on
consumption shifts being biased towards more or less energy-intensive goods. Such bias includes,
for instance, the well documented shift away from industrial sectors to comparatively clean service

1

sectors. Third, our general equilibrium framework allows us to distinguish consumption effects from
production-driven differences in emission levels. While EKC studies have been criticized for lacking
structure or causal interpretation (Levinson and O’Brien, 2018), we identify the role of per capita
income in determining emissions through changes in consumption choices. This allows to pinpoint its
role in simulations.
Our multi-regional general equilibrium model is an extension of Caron, Fally and Markusen (2014).
The identification strategy estimates sectoral income elasticities of consumption from cross-country
variations in consumption patterns while disentangling demand from supply-side effects. Failing to do
so, we might for example confound the fact that high-income countries consume less energy-intensive
goods not because their consumers are richer but because those goods are more expensive there.
Available consumer price data are hard to match to production, input-output and trade data, and
are also prone to endogeneity. We sidestep these issues by constructing price index proxies from
supply-side patterns of comparative advantage and trade costs estimated in a gravity model. In our
benchmark specification, non-homotheticity is modeled using Constant Relative Income Elasticity
(CRIE) preferences1 , but we test the sensitivity of results to alternative demand systems leading to
more flexible Engel curves. The supply-side structure is an extension of Costinot et al. (2012) and
Eaton and Kortum (2002) with multiple factors of production and an input-output structure as in
Caliendo and Parro (2015). Fossil fuel supply is determined through the supply of a specific factor.
The model is estimated using the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP8) dataset — a collection
of consumption2 , input-output, production and trade data for 109 countries spanning most of the per
capita income spectrum and 57 sectors covering the whole economy. This dataset allows us to track
the direct CO2 content of consumption linked to the final consumption of CO2 -emitting energy goods
(coal, natural gas, electricity and refined oil). We also use the multi-regional input-output tables
to compute the indirect CO2 content of consumption: emissions caused by the production of goods
throughout their global supply chain.
We present our results in stages: from sector-level to country-level partial-equilibrium evidence,
then to general-equilibrium simulations. We first look at the cross-sector relationship between total
(direct and indirect) CO2 intensities and the estimated income elasticities determined by the structure
of preferences. The income elasticity of CO2 -emitting energy goods is generally below one, including
that of electricity and refined oil. When including non-energy goods, we find an inverted-U relationship
in which goods of intermediate income elasticity (including transportation and manufacturing sectors)
have the highest total CO2 intensity on average. However, the relationship is negative overall, with
the highest income elasticity goods (mostly services) having the lowest CO2 intensity. The invertedU and negative relationship is significant within the set of non-energy goods as well. This findings
provide preliminary evidence for a demand-side explanation of the income-emissions link: consumers
1
We chose these preferences as they are practical to estimate, and provide a simple link between estimated coefficients
and income elasticities. CRIE preferences are also easily combined with CES preferences within industries to generate
gravity within industries.

Throughout, we use consumption to describe final demand. In our data and model, it includes household, government
and investment demand.

at different income levels consume baskets of different average CO2 intensity.
We then investigate how this translates into differences in the average CO2 content of consumption
baskets (bundles) across countries, expressed in kg of CO2 per dollar of consumption — i.e. a measure
of CO2 intensity. The data exhibit considerable cross-country variation, but also reveal a distinct
asymmetric inverted-U and overall negative relationship between per capita income and both the
direct and total average CO2 contents of consumption: lower middle-income countries have the highest
emissions intensities; high-income countries the lowest. This is consistent with the EKC literature
which has identified an inverted-U pattern for the CO2 intensity of GDP (but not total emissions).
While, unsurprisingly, a large part of the observed decrease in emissions intensities with income is
to be attributed to technological differences (or within-sector shifts in consumption which we do not
observe), differences in consumption patterns play a substantial role: they explain 33% of the crosscountry variability in the total CO2 intensity of consumption and generate a relationship in which
intensities are lowest at high incomes.
To identify the role of per capita income, we re-estimate average CO2 content of consumption
using fitted consumption patterns generated from identical but non-homothetic preferences. Results
confirm that income itself, through its influence on consumption patterns, explains a significant part
of the variability in CO2 contents across countries. While we find here that the influence of incomedriven consumption patterns on direct consumption emissions is stronger than on total consumption
emissions, it is still strong when non-energy goods are included: differences in income cause the
predicted average CO2 content to drop from an average of 0.733 kg/$ for low-income countries to
0.461 kg/$ for high-income countries. Interestingly, we find that the average CO2 embodied in each
dollar of imported consumption also decreases in per capita income (which runs contrary to the
pollution-heaven hypothesis) and that non-homothetic preferences can partially explain this negative
correlation.
Having established per capita income as an important determinant of CO2 intensity, we then
investigate the potential for growth in income to shift consumption patterns in a way which affects
aggregate energy use and emissions, absent any improvements in technology. Using our generalequilibrium model, we simulate a counterfactual increase in income and estimate resulting changes in
consumption emissions. While the equilibrium change in energy consumed ultimately also depends
on the supply of energy, we find, for plausible values of supply elasticity, a strong reduction in the
direct CO2 intensity of consumption. Accounting for general-equilibrium effects, we find that a 1%
increase in income increases direct consumption emissions by only 0.88% on average (compared to the
1% increase which we would obtain with homothetic preferences). More flexible demand specifications
and higher supply elasticity of fossil fuels lead to an even stronger negative effect. Income effects for
the total CO2 content of consumption baskets (including CO2 embodied in non-energy goods) are
considerably weaker on aggregate: our benchmark estimate for the income elasticity of the world’s
CO2 content of consumption (which equals that of production) is 0.97. However, the near-homothetic
world average effect hides significant heterogeneity. For both the direct and total CO2 content, lowincome countries have elasticities that are higher than one (that is, are still to the left of their intensity

3

peak such that their consumption patterns are predicted to change in way which increases emissions),
while most middle- and high-income countries have elasticities that are far below the world average.
All of these results follow through when considering the secondary energy intensity of consumption
instead of its CO2 intensity. However, including other greenhouse gases (CH4 , N2 O and fluorinated
gases) changes the picture because goods with the lowest income elasticity (such as agriculture) are
responsible for the highest emissions of these gases. This leads to a negative cross-sectoral correlation between total GHG-intensity and income elasticity which turns the inverted-U cross-country
relationship identified for CO2 strictly negative.
The paper proceeds as follows. After an overview of related literature, Section 2 describes our
theoretical framework, including the equations describing counterfactual equilibria. Section 3 describes
implications of equilibrium outcomes (consumption, production) on CO2 emissions. Section 4 describes
the data and econometric estimation strategy. Section 5 describes all results including a decomposition
of CO2 contents and simulations outcomes. Section 6 presents extensions to the benchmark model.

Context and related literature
Our paper relates to at least three distinct lines of research: i) literature on the “Environmental
Kuznet Curve” (EKC) describing how aggregate emissions depend on GDP per capita and stages of
development; ii) studies of income effects in energy consumption based on household microdata; iii)
models of emissions forecasting.
We focus on income-driven shifts in consumption patterns, which directly affect the energy intensity
of GDP, a critical ingredient in understanding cross-country differences in emission levels.3 This relates
to various studies documenting the link between GDP per capita and aggregate emissions. To our
knowledge, existing studies either focus on documenting aggregate outcomes, or if they link emissions
to sectoral composition, do not explicitly model and estimate income effects in consumption.
Existing evidence suggests heterogeneous and complex relationships between per capita income
and the aggregate energy intensity of GDP. The energy intensity of most high-income countries, as
well as that of the world, has been declining for decades (Raupach et al., 2007), while most of the
developing world has a stable or increasing energy intensity of GDP.4 Although total CO2 , contrary
to a number of other pollutants, tends to increase with income, the literature has found evidence
for an inverted-U relationship between CO2 per capita or CO2 intensity (in kg/$) and income across
countries: see Schmalensee et al. (1998), Dietz and Rosa (1997), Roberts and Grimes (1997) for cross3

Cross-country differences in emissions, as well as their evolution, can be decomposed into differences in population,
GDP per capita, the energy intensity of GDP and the emissions intensity of energy. This is also known as the Kaya
F
identity (Yamaji et al., 1991), in which F = P × G
×E
×E
, where P refers to population, G is GDP and E is primary
P
G
energy consumption. Emissions are thus influenced by g = G/P , per capita GDP; e = E/G, the energy intensity of
GDP; and f = F/E, the carbon intensity of energy. We focus on the role of e and the degree to which it is determined
by consumption patterns.

Raupach et al. (2007) find that it has declined by about 15% between 1980 and 2005, or by more than 40% if GDP
is evaluated at purchasing power parity. See Figure 2 of Raupach et al. (2007) for world levels and Figure 4 for a country
decomposition. Evaluating GDP at purchasing power parity increases the weight put on developing economies. In the
present paper, GDP and income are evaluated at market exchange rates.

country studies or Aldy (2005) for a comparison across US states. This EKC suggests that countries
become comparatively cleaner, per dollar, after reaching a certain level of development. Most EKC
studies are based on aggregate energy and emissions data. Using sectorally-disaggregated datasets,
several papers in the multi-regional input-output literature have also identified evidence for both a
consumption and a production-based EKC (see Peters, 2008). Hertwich and Peters (2009) estimate a
cross-country elasticity of CO2 to income of 0.81 on average, and their results suggest an inverted-U
curve for emissions intensities.
Economists, among others Grossman and Krueger (1995), have suggested decomposing the relationship between income and environmental quality between scale, technique and composition. Focusing on local pollutants (not CO2 ), they have identified an EKC turning point at relatively low income
levels, and argued that it could be caused by composition effects. Only a limited number of studies
have focused specifically on the role of sectoral composition effects. Existing work tends to be reducedform in nature, without examining the structure of preferences and non-homotheticities driving these
composition effects. In a paper similar in spirit to ours, Medlock and Soligo (2001), using a threesector model, time series data and controlling for prices, have found that structural shifts between
agriculture, transportation and industrial sectors generate an EKC turning point. However, they do
not focus on consumption patterns specifically and do not distinguish production from consumption
effects.5
A distinct but related strand of the literature investigates the relationship between income, consumption patterns and CO2 emissions at the household level, typically based on single-country survey
data. There is unambiguous evidence of income-driven consumption effects: differences in income
significantly affect household energy use. Most studies which focus on industrialized countries find
direct energy consumption to be a necessity good (see Wier et al., 2001 or Munksgaard et al., 2001
among others), in line with our findings. Kerkhof et al. (2009) compare estimates across countries and
investigate how emissions from households in the UK, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden respond
to income. They find heterogeneous effects: in the UK and Netherlands, rising income means declining
emissions intensities. In Sweden and Norway, emission intensities are lower but increase with income.
They attribute these differences to housing and heating patterns across income levels.
Also focusing on household behaviour but with a structural approach, Levinson and O’Brien (2018)
find strong evidence for consumption effects in the US. They estimate “Environmental Engel Curves”:
the relationship between income and the consumption of various pollutants (not including CO2 ).
These also identify demand-side effects by holding prices constant and include indirect emissions.
They find such Engel curves to be concave, with an income elasticity of energy that is lower than one.
Our approach, while focusing instead on energy and CO2 over a large number of countries, is similar.
Much less is known about this relationship in the developing world, where most of the future
5

Also related is Shapiro and Walker (2014), who decompose the evolution of CO2 emissions in US manufacturing over
the last decades and report that consumer preferences have not changed in a way which substantially affects the level of
emissions. While they control for environmental stringency, trade costs and productivity improvements to come to this
conclusion, their data only cover manufacturing goods, do not include input-output linkages, and they do not attempt
to make economy-wide statements about the role of preferences.

growth in energy demand is expected to occur. Studies looking at the determinants behind energy
use (fossil fuels and electricity) include Farsi et al. (2007) for a survey of urban Indian households,
and Golley and Meng (2012) or Cao et al. (2016) for a survey of urban Chinese households. These
studies present a mixed picture regarding the relationship between energy intensities and income.
Others focus more directly on the relationship between income and the demand for energy-intensive
appliances. Davis and Gertler (2015), for example, point to large possible increases in the adoption
of air conditioning. Gertler et al. (2016) review the implications of growing demand for appliances
in the developing world, relying on survey data describing household appliance and vehicle purchases
collected in several large developing countries. In a simple reduced-form estimation based on countrylevel data, they find that the income elasticity of energy demand displays an inverted-U pattern that
remains below one in all countries and peaks around 0.8. Exploiting randomized cash transfers, they
also identify an S-shaped relationship between expenditure levels and ownership of energy-intensive
appliances (such as refrigerators) in which ownership of these durables evolves from very low levels to
saturation levels at particular stages of development. Similar S-shape patterns have been identified in
the case of Chinese households by Zhao et al. (2011). These findings are in line with Wolfram et al.
(2012) who predicted large coming increases in developing-world energy demand, as large populations
are just at the beginning of the energy-intensive appliance purchase process.
Our paper differs from the above in that, despite relying on aggregated consumption data, it covers
a wide range of countries across a broader income spectrum. Although we do not model the demand
for energy-consuming appliances directly, our dataset tracks the direct demand for secondary energy
which these appliances use (mainly electricity, oil and natural gas). It can thus implicitly pick up
S-shaped appliance adoption patterns. These can indeed lead to an inverted-U relationship between
aggregate energy intensity and per capita income, as households progress from purchasing energyconsuming appliances (increasing energy intensity) to being saturated in these appliances (decreasing
energy intensity). Furthermore, our dataset allows the estimation of the indirect (embodied) usage
of energy — an element usually not considered in the literature — and allows us to examine generalequilibrium implications by combining both the demand and supply sides.
Finally, our paper also relates to an extended literature on energy and emissions projection modeling. Despite the evidence that energy intensity varies systematically with income levels, the relationship has been given little attention in these exercises. This is surprising, given that a variety of
decision makers benefit from reliable projections, including climate impact and adaptation managers,
energy resource and technology managers, government officials, and others responsible for developing
regional and national policy related to energy use or climate change.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which provides “Representative [emissions] concentration pathways” for earth system modelers to use as inputs, does not attempt to
generate explicit predictions of future emission intensity. Instead, they favor a set of alternative scenarios in which changes in emissions intensity are implicitly considered but are not based on empirical
estimates. The International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook (IEA, 2013), one of the most
comprehensive energy demand forecasting exercises, allows for income elasticity of household demand
6

to deviate from unity for a limited number of residential demand components. These are limited
to residential buildings and include water heating, appliances, lighting, cooking and cooling. Their
elasticity estimates are also unpublished, and only cover a limited number of countries.
Most of the computable general equilibrium models used for energy and emissions projections
(e.g. Paltsev et al., 2005) either rely on homothetic (generally constant elasticity of substitution)
demand systems, or when they do allow consumption patterns to vary with income, do so with crudely
calibrated elasticities. Dai et al. (2012) recognize the need to account for non-homothetic behavior
in such models. In attempting to improve the forecasts of emissions growth in China, they provide
non-parametric income elasticity estimates. However, they do not include these estimates within the
model and instead use arbitrary scenarios describing the growth paths of future expenditure shares.
To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to consistently estimate income elasticity across
a wide range of sectors for a set of countries covering most of the world economy, and describe their
relationship with CO2 intensity across sectors. It is unique in pinpointing the role of per capita income
growth, through its influence on consumption patterns, in determining future worldwide emissions.6

Theoretical framework

We rely on the general equilibrium model of consumption, production and international trade introduced in Caron, Fally and Markusen (2014), which we extend to track energy demand and CO2
emissions. The model’s supply-side is an extension of Costinot et al. (2012) and Eaton and Kortum
(2002) with treatment of intermediate inputs as in Caliendo and Parro (2015). The demand side formulation allows for non-homothetic preferences. We use this general-equilibrium structure to estimate
all key parameters of interest and conduct counterfactual simulations.

2.1.1

Model setup
Demand

In our benchmark specification, we adopt a demand system derived from constant relative income
elasticity (CRIE) preferences, as in Fieler (2011) and Caron et al. (2014), with early analyses and
applications found in Hanoch (1975) and Chao and Manne (1982). In section 6.1, we examine the
sensitivity of our results to the use of non-homothetic CES preferences as in Comin et al. (2015).
Consider a set of heterogeneous industries k, each of which is composed of a continuum of product
varieties indexed by jk ∈ [0, 1]. Preferences take the form:
U=

X

σk −1
σk

α1,k Qk

k
6

In an orthogonal approach, van Benthem (2015) uses long time series to estimate whether energy consumption
patterns in the developing world have converged to those of rich countries faster than their income. While he finds
limited evidence for such “energy leapfrogging” overall, there is evidence that the consumption patterns of countries of
similar levels of income have become more energy-intensive over time. That framework however doesn’t allow identifying
whether these shifts are due to changes in preferences or changes in technology.

Production and trade in non-energy sectors

The focus of the analysis being on the demand-side, we formulate a flexible structure of supply which
will allow us to control for any pattern of comparative advantage forces at the sector level.
Production of primary energy sectors (defined below) k ∈ P is distinguished from that of nonenergy sectors k ∈
/ P in order to allow calibration of their supply elasticity, which is critical to
the general equilibrium response of emissions. For non-energy sectors, we assume Cobb-Douglas
production functions with constant returns to scale where production depends on factors and bundles of
intermediate goods from each industry (the production function of primary energy sectors is described
later).
We assume that factors of production are perfectly mobile across sectors but immobile across
countries. We denote by wf n the price of factor f in country n. Factor intensities for each industry
k and factor f are denoted by βikf , and may vary across countries i. We denote by γihk the share
of the input bundles from industry h in total costs of industry k (direct input-output coefficient) in
country i, and each input bundle is a CES aggregate of all varieties available in this industry. For sake
of exposition we assume that the elasticity of substitution between varieties is the same as for final
goods (see discussion in footnote 9). Total factor productivity Zik (jk ) varies by country, industry and
variety. We assume iceberg transport costs dnik ≥ 1 from country i to country n in sector k. The unit
It is clear from Equation 2 that the ratio of the income elasticities of any pair of goods k and k0 equals the ratio of
their σ parameters: εεnk0 = σσk0 and is constant across countries.

There is perfect competition for the supply of each variety jk . Hence, the price of variety jk
in country n in industry k equals pnk (jk ) = mini {pnik (jk )}. We follow Eaton and Kortum (2002)
and assume that productivity Zik (jk ) is a random variable with a Frechet distribution. This setting
generates gravity within each sector. Productivity is independently drawn in each country i and


industry k, with a cumulative distribution Fik (z) = exp −(z/zik )−θk where zik is a productivity
shifter reflecting average TFP of country i in sector k. Given the Frechet distribution, we obtain a
gravity equation for each industry. As in Eaton and Kortum (2002), θk is related to the inverse of
productivity dispersion across varieties within each sector k. Note that we also assume θk > ξk − 1
to ensure a well-defined CES price index within each industry. As in Costinot et al. (2012), we also
allow the shift parameter zik to vary across exporters and industries, controlling for any pattern of
Ricardian comparative advantage forces at the sector level. Each country i is populated by a number
Li of individuals. The total supply of factor f is fixed in each country and denoted by Vif . Each
individual is endowed by Vif /Li units of factor Vf i implying no within-country income inequality.8
2.1.3

Energy sectors and CO2 emissions

Primary and secondary energy sectors. Among energy sectors k ∈ E, we differentiate primary
sectors, P, and secondary sectors, S. Coal, natural gas and crude oil (as well as renewables and
nuclear, which we ignore here as they do not emit CO2 ) are considered to be “primary energy”
sectors. “Secondary energy” describes sectors which can directly be used as inputs to production
and/or in final demand. These include refined oil and electricity as well as coal and gas which can be
both primary and secondary. Most CO2 is emitted during the consumption (intermediate of final) of
secondary energy or the transformation of primary energy into electricity, while a smaller amount is
emitted during the refining of oil, gas and coal.
Production function.

The production of primary energy goods (the fossil fuel sectors) requires the

input of a “natural resource” factor of production that is specific to each sector. The endowments of
these factors are fixed, so the supply elasticity of these fossil fuel sectors depends on the possibility to
adjust factors that are mobile across sectors to complement natural resources (example: using capital
and labor to extract more oil out of the same resource).
We assume that primary energy sectors combine their sector-specific natural resources with the
other mobile inputs in a CES upper-tier with elasticity of substitution νk . The mobile inputs enter

In a robustness check in Caron et al. (2014), we extend the model and estimation strategy to account for withincountry income inequality and find very similar estimates, if not slightly wider differences in income elasticities.

/ E and can be seen as a special case where µR,ik = 0.
Emissions.

CO2 emissions occur during the consumption of fossil fuels. Emissions related to the

use of energy sector k ∈ E as an input to sector h in country i is assumed to depend linearly on
quantities of k consumed in h:
C
CO2ikh = ηikh
Qikh
C are fixed and country-sector specific, and where Q

C represent physical quantities of CO , in kilograms, and depends on energy good k being used (e.g.

refined petroleum) and the buying industry h (e.g. chemicals or transportation). Coefficients may
vary according to industry depending on the share of fossil fuels combusted as opposed to transformed.
C coefficients are zero for that sector.
The consumption of electricity does not emit CO2 and the ηikh

Some CO2 emissions are also directly related to final consumption of secondary energy goods
(again, except electricity):
C
CO2ikF = ηikF
QikF

where QikF ≡

From the quantity-based coefficients η C , we can derive value-based coefficients (based on benchmark energy prices) to describe emissions from each dollar of production or consumption. We compute

We refer to section 3 for further details on CO2 emissions accounting, linking emissions in upstream
industries (potentially from different producing countries) to the composition of final demand.

2.2

Equilibrium

We now define the equations which determine the equilibrium. On the demand side, total expenditures
Dnk of country n in final goods k simply equals population Ln times individual expenditures as
described by Equation 1. This gives:
Dnk = Ln (λn )−σk α2,k (Pnk )1−σk

(7)

where α2,k is the industry constant defined in equation 1. λn is the Lagrangian multiplier associated
with the budget constraint:
Ln In =

X

Dnk

(8)

k

where In denotes per-capita income.
Total demand Xnk for goods k in country n is the sum of the demand for final consumption Dnk
and intermediate use:
Xnk = Dnk +

X

γnkh Ynh

(9)

h

where Ynh refers to total production in sector h.
We denote by Xnik the value of trade from country i to country n, with:
Xnik =

Sik (dnik )−θk
Xnk
Φnk

(10)

where Sik and Φnk are defined as follows. The “supplier effect”, Sik , is inversely related to the cost
of production in country i and industry k. It depends on the total factor productivity parameter zik
and the prices of intermediate goods and factors:

Sik = zik

The parameter θk is inversely related to the dispersion of productivity within sectors, implying that

11

differences in productivity and factor prices across countries have a stronger impact on trade flows in
sectors with higher θk .
For primary energy goods, the supplier effect also depends on fixed natural resources:

In turn, we define Φnk as the sum of exporter fixed effects deflated by trade costs:

This Φnk acts as an “inward multilateral trade resistance index” and is closely related to the price

Finally, two other market clearing conditions are required to determine factor prices and income
in general equilibrium. Given the Cobb-Douglas production function, total income from a particular
factor equals the sum of total production weighted by the factor intensity coefficient βikf . With factor
supply Vf i and factor price wf i for factor f in country i, factor market clearing implies:

This can be generalized by allowing the elasticity of substitution for intermediate use to differ from the elasticity of
substitution for final use, and depends on the parent industry. This does not affect the elasticity of the price index w.r.t.
Φk as long as θk does not depend on the final use. Differences in elasticities of substitution would be captured by the
industry fixed effect that we include in our estimation strategy and would not affect our estimates.

12

By Walras’ Law, trade is balanced at equilibrium. Given the equilibrium Xnk and Pnk of energy
sectors, we can then back out emissions using equations 5 and 6.

2.3

Counterfactual equilibria

Following Dekle et al. (2007) and Caliendo and Parro (2015), the model lends itself naturally to
counterfactual simulations. Using a set of observed variables and a limited number of parameters to
estimate, the above equilibrium conditions can be reformulated to define a counterfactual equilibrium
relative to our baseline equilibrium.10 Specifically, using “exact hat algebra” where Zb = Z 0 /Z denotes
the relative change in variable Z, we obtain the following set of equilibrium conditions:

Implications for CO2 emissions

3.1

CO2 content of consumption, production and imports

There are several ways to illustrate the link between income and CO2 emissions. While this paper
focuses on how consumption patterns affect consumption emissions both directly and indirectly, we
also show how they affect production emissions and emissions embodied in imported consumption.
Input-output linkages and total emission coefficients Being interested in the total impact of
consumption patterns on CO2 emissions, we need to track the production of goods across all source
countries and sectors generated by a dollar of final consumption in each sector and country. This
requires 1) import shares πnih to inform how total demand from country n leads to production in
country i; and 2) requirement coefficients γnhk (coefficients of the Cobb-Douglas production function)
to track the demand for inputs from industry h by the parent industry k in country n. The πnih γnhk
product provides the direct requirement coefficients of a multi-regional input-output matrix A. Production of good h in country i must equal final demand plus intermediate demand by downstream
industries, such that we obtain:
Yih =

tot coefficients of the
Building on this standard input-output accounting equality, we obtain the γnikh

(I − A)−1 π matrix (also called “total requirement coefficients” associated with the “Leontief inverse”).
These inform on the dollar amount of production in country i in industry h ultimately generated by
tot
each dollar of final demand for product k in country n.11 These total requirement coefficients γnikh

are used to define total CO2 coefficients:

i.e. the indirect (for all goods) and direct (for fossil fuels only) emissions associated with the consumption of each dollar of good k in country i sourced from all countries n.
Using these coefficients, we can easily compute measures of country-level CO2 contents. In order
to facilitate decompositions in Section 5.4, we take care to describe each as functions of final demand
Dnk .
Direct CO2 content of consumption

We first examine direct consumption emissions, i.e. CO2

caused by the consumption of fossil fuels (refined oil, natural gas and coal) as final goods. As is
common in the literature, we also include the emissions embodied in electricity consumption even
though these emissions do not occur directly in final demand. We thus define, for each country n:

Note that in general, because of international trade, emissions (indirectly) embodied in consumption
differ from emissions from domestic production since domestic consumption may rely on imports and
domestic production may be consumed elsewhere.
Production emissions

Production emissions in country n are the sum of emissions occurring during

the production of all sectors k in n.12 As described above, production Ynk can be linked to the sector

Total CO2 content of imported consumption We can also go a bit further and decompose the
indirect emissions content of consumption into its domestic and imported components. The emissions

We do not define production emissions as the emissions content of production, which would include the emissions

3.2

Counterfactual changes in CO2 emissions

The above equations describing the emissions content of consumption inform only on the link between
emissions and observed demand patterns, all in partial equilibrium. In this section, we further explore
how a change in income affects emissions through consumption patterns, linking those more precisely to
the structure of preferences. We also account for changes in relative demand and substitution between
energy and other factors of production which may lead to different responses in CO2 emissions.
In order to focus on the demand-side mechanism of shifting consumption patterns, we consider the
effect of a neutral increase in income caused by counterfactual uniform factor productivity growth, ẑ.
This counterfactual, increasing factor productivity uniformly across sectors and countries, is motivated
by two key points.
First, it is a natural case to study the differences between homothetic and non-homothetic preferences. If preferences are homothetic, it leads to a homogeneous increase in real income ẑ in all
countries and no change in consumption patterns, production and trade. CO2 emissions would increase uniformly by ẑ in all countries. If preferences are non-homothetic, the ratio of income to prices
still increases by ẑ (as a first-order approximation) but income effects lead to a reallocation of expenditures across goods (changes in consumption patterns). If income elasticity is correlated with CO2
intensity across goods, this will translate into aggregate changes in emissions that may understate or
exceed those with homothetic preferences.
Second, a general-equilibrium implication of this counterfactual is that factor costs will change
homogeneously across countries as a first-order approximation, which leaves trade shares πnik unchanged. Note also that input-output coefficients remain fixed thanks to the Cobb-Douglas upper
tier. This implies that we can continue to use some of the tools developed in the previous sub-section
to describe trade and input-output linkages.
Our key variable of interest is the income elasticity of emissions. For each country, we thus
d dir and
compute the response of both the direct and total average CO2 content of consumption, EC

d tot (combining EC
d dir and EC
d indir ), as well as production emissions, EY

Neither measures are equal to the total emissions embodied in imports, which would include imported intermediates not
necessarily consumed within the country — and are therefore not the focus of this study.
14
These are derived from a counterfactual equilibrium following a homogeneous factor productivity increase, which
is equivalent to a sectoral TFP increase zˆik = ẑ βik > 1 in all countries and sectors, where 1 − βik is the share of
intermediate goods in production. Note that the effect on emissions would be different if the economy were growing due
to the accumulation of certain factors or if technology growth was biased towards more or less CO2 -intensive sectors.

shock is applied to all sectors. In our simulations, we also test the sensitivity of results to the exclusion
of growth in fossil fuel resource productivity.
Partial equilibrium approximation

While the computation of exact changes relies on numer-

ical methods and is delegated to our empirical section 5.5, we present here some intuition behind
counterfactual changes in emissions. We do so with first-order analytical approximations in partial
equilibrium, neglecting changes in relative factor prices for non-resource factors (e.g. returns to labor
relative to capital). Assuming that resource factors account for a negligible share of GDP, we can
normalize GDP to remain constant in each country.
The homogeneous productivity increase zb leads, as a first approximation, to a homogeneous change
d
in prices P
b−1 for non-energy goods k. In Appendix Section A.2, we show how equations 18
nk ≈ z
and 27 can be used to obtain a simple expression for changes in demand as a function of productivity
growth and income elasticity εnk (as defined in equation 2):
d
log D
nk ≈ (εnk − 1) log ẑ

(36)

where εnk generally differs from unity if preferences are non-homothetic.
As we have seen previously (equation 29) we can link production to changes in demand using the
P
tot , with Y
tot
“total requirement coefficients” γnikh
ih =
n,k γnikh Dik . In this counterfactual where trade
shares remain constant as a first order approximation, these total requirement coefficients can also be
used to characterize changes in output as a function of the changes in consumption baskets and the
productivity shock log ẑ. We obtain:
log Ybih =

Yih

(37)

with:

In this equation, we define a sector’s “total income elasticity” εtot
ih as the weighted-average of income
elasticity εik of all the final goods in which that sector’s output is embodied and in all destination
countries. This new tool helps describe income effects in production, including the effects of income
on both a good’s final demand and use as an intermediate good.
Equation 37 is a good approximation for most sectors, but less so for energy goods given that
they require specific natural resources and thus have a finite supply elasticity ζih .15 To examine
counterfactual changes in emissions, we thus need to examine changes in energy prices, which depend
crucially on the supply elasticity. As a first-order approximation, accounting for the endogenous
change in natural resource prices, the change in the production cost of primary energy good k is given
by 1 log Ybik , where Ybik refers to the change in the value of production. From equations 13 and
1+ζik

14, we obtain that the change in prices in (destination) country n is an average (weighted by import

With these tools in hand, we can then derive expressions for the counterfactual changes in emissions

This approximation has an intuitive interpretation. First, it shows that growth in direct consumption
emissions is directly driven by productivity growth log ẑ. The middle term in the brackets reflects
the non-homothetic demand effect: if the income elasticity of secondary energy is on average below
one, it will pull direct emissions downwards (income elasticities are weighted by each good’s share of
direct consumption emissions in n, CO2nkF /ECndir ). The last term reflects the attenuating effect of
reductions in energy prices caused by lower-than-proportional demand for primary energy (again a
function of each sector’s share of direct emissions).16
In Section 5.5 we compare these changes in emissions, expressed as elasticities to log ẑ, to exact
simulated changes to validate our approximations.
Indirect and total CO2 content of consumption

we similarly obtain:

As above, this expression has a straightforward interpretation. The demand effect (middle term in
the brackets) is the sum of εnk (which drives growth in final demand for k) weighted by each sector’s
P Cindir
share of embodied consumption emissions (recall from equation 33 that ECnindir = k βnkF
Dnk ).
Thus growth in country n’s ECnindir will be larger if sectors with high CO2 intensity, and thus high
16

It cancels the non-homothetic demand effect if the supply elasticity is zero ζik and the direct income elasticity of
each energy good is the same as its weighted total income elasticity (this would be the case if there were no intermediate
use of energy, for instance).

Data and estimation Strategy

4.1

Data

The empirical analysis is based on the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) version 8 dataset
(Aguiar et al., 2012). This dataset is uniquely suited to our purposes, as it contains a consistent
and reconciled cross-section of production, input-output, consumption and trade data. It provides
considerable heterogeneity in energy and CO2 intensity as well as consumption patterns across 57
sectors which cover manufacturing, agriculture, transport and services. The 109 countries in the
dataset (composite regions are dropped) cover a wide range of per capita income levels and all stages
of economic development.17 All values represent the 2007 economy. The full list of sectors and
countries in the dataset can be found in Tables A.1 and A.2 of the Appendix.
The dataset is complemented with physical energy use data from the International Energy Agency’s
(IEA) “Extended Energy Balances” . It comprises both primary and secondary energy use, expressed
17

In comparison, the WIOD dataset (www.wiod.org) covers 40 countries across 35 sectors.

19

in millions of tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe), for all countries and sectors.18 It also includes corresponding carbon dioxide emission data by fossil fuel, expressed in million of tonnes (MtCO2 ), for both
intermediate demand and final consumption, simplifying the computation of CO2 intensity coefficients
by sector.19
Data describing the emissions of other greenhouse gases, methane, nitrous oxides and fluorinated
greenhouse gases (CH4 , N2 O and F -gases), are compiled by Amer et al. (2014). These non-CO2
emissions are associated with the use of factors of production (capital, land), intermediate inputs
(energy, chemicals) or directly in production (chemical processes, for example). These have been
matched to GTAP sectors, by country, and converted into CO2 equivalents, making them directly
comparable (and additional) to CO2 in terms of global warming potential.20 These gases are primarily
associated with agricultural production, including livestock, but a non-negligible share is emitted
during other industrial processes and transport. As with CO2 emissions, the GTAP data allow us
to trace greenhouse gas emissions through the entire chain of production, accounting for trade and
input-output linkages.
Despite the clear advantage of supplying harmonized consumption, production and trade data for
a wide range of countries, two weaknesses of the GTAP data should be recognized. First, not all values
in the dataset are directly observed in all countries for the same year. Some values are extrapolated
from previous years, and some missing sectors are shared out proportionally to world averages or to
similar countries. Second, the data have been adjusted to provide a balanced micro-consistent dataset
which can be used for computable general equilibrium analysis. This procedure modifies the raw data
by an undocumented amount.
Throughout the analysis, we define final consumption as the sum of household and government
consumption as well as investment final demand (as defined in GTAP). Finally, the gravity estimations
rely on bilateral variables describing physical distance, common language, colonial link and contiguity
which are obtained from CEPII.21

4.2

Using gravity to estimate cross-country price differences

We now describe the estimation of the key parameters in the model. The estimation here closely
follows Caron, Fally and Markusen (2014, 2017), although with a newer dataset and a number of
additional robustness checks. The main challenge is to disentangle demand and supply side effects.
For instance, a country with a comparative advantage in a certain sector will tend to have lower
relative prices in that sector, leading to relatively larger production volumes as well as higher or
lower demand, depending on whether elasticities of substitution are higher or lower than unity. These
patterns may bias our cross-sectional estimates of income elasticity. Using gravity equations as a first

The dataset does not cover CO2 emissions which are unrelated with fossil fuel use. Some industrial processes, notably
cement manufacturing, produce CO2 . These emissions account for less than 5% of total CO2 emissions.

These other greenhouse gases are equivalent to about a third of total GHG emissions in terms of warming potential.

step, we are able to estimate patterns of comparative advantage separately from demand-side effects,
which then allows us to control for supply-side effects when estimating preferences.
In a first step, we rewrite equation 10 in logs and allow trade costs dnik to depend on a number of
factors such as distance and contiguity. We thus obtain a set of gravity equations in which Sik , Φnk
and xnk are captured using exporter (F Xik ) and importer (F Mnk ) fixed effects:
log xnik = F Xik + F Mnk − βDist,k log Distni + βContig,k .Contiguityni
+ βLang,k .CommonLangni + βColony,k .ColonialLinkni + βHomeBias,k .In=i + εnik
This gravity equation is estimated separately for each sector using Poisson pseudo maximum
likelihood regressions (as in Fally, 2015). The gravity equations are used to estimate trade costs and
patterns of comparative advantage. Following the strategy developed by Redding and Venables (2004),
d
we then use the estimates of log Sik (F
X ik ), and log dnik (using all transport cost proxies and their
coefficients) to construct an estimate of our price index proxy Φnk as:

trading partners with large comparative advantages in the sector.

Estimating non-homothetic preferences

The value of individual expenditures in an industry is determined by Equation 1, the stochastic version
of which is estimated in logs as:
log dnk = log αk + −σk . log λn +

σk − 1
b nk + εnk
. log Φ
θk

(44)

in which αk is a sector-specific preference parameter which varies across industries only and λn is
the shadow value of the budget constraint. σk , our parameter of interest, drives both income and
price elasticity, but as θk is left unconstrained in the estimation of Equation 44, income and price
elasticities are estimated separately. In addition, final demand should satisfy the budget constraint
(equation 8) which determines the Lagrangian multiplier λn : a higher income per capita is associated
with a smaller λn . There is no closed-form solution expressing λn as a function of per capita income
In except in the homothetic case where σk = σ is constant across goods, so equations 44 and 8 are
estimated simultaneously using constrained non-linear least square regressions. Regressions and the
corresponding statistics we report, including the R2, are weighted by each sector’s mean expenditure
share. Finally, using the estimates of σk and observed expenditure shares, we can compute the income
21

elasticity of consumption of each sector k in country n using equation 2.

Empirical results: The income-consumption-CO2 relationship

In this section, we investigate the role of per capita income in determining CO2 emissions levels through
its impact on consumption patterns. We start by describing the estimation of preference parameters
and income elasticities, correlate them to CO2 intensity coefficients across sectors, and investigate the
link between income and emissions across countries. Finally, we use the estimated general equilibrium
model to simulate the extent to which per capita income growth affects CO2 emissions.
To motivate our empirical analysis, the first four columns of Table 1 display the average expenditure
share of energy goods as well as broad categories of non-energy goods in lower, lower-middle, uppermiddle and high-income countries (based on World Bank guidelines for 2007).22 Significant differences
for all goods indicate large scope for income to affect consumption patterns across the spectrum of
per-capita income levels.23
The last column of Table 1 displays each sector’s (world average) share of total consumption
emissions (EC total ). It shows that on average, the “direct” consumption of energy (mostly electricity
and refined oil but also natural gas and coal) corresponds to about 27% of the emissions associated
with consumption. Consumption of non-energy goods is thus associated with large shares of emissions,
mostly through manufacturing and service sectors.

The classification is based on GNI/capita. The cut-off for low-income countries is 935$ and below, while it is 3705$
for lower-middle-income countries and 11455$ for upper-middle-income countries. In our dataset, there are 16, 27, 24
and 42 countries in each income class.
23
These expenditure shares represent the share of total final demand expenditures (including investment and government expenditures). If considering the share of spending within household consumption only, expenditure shares for
energy goods would be higher, corresponding to 4.3% of expenditures (on average over all countries) instead of 2.4% if
considering total final demand.

5.1

Consumption patterns and income elasticity estimates

The first step in our estimation procedure is to estimate supply-side parameters describing comparative
advantage and trade costs. The results from the gravity equations are standard and summary statistics
can be found in Appendix Table A.3. From these, we back out our price index proxies and use them
to estimate income elasticity.
As already documented in Caron et al. (2014), the constrained NLLS estimation of demand patterns
described by equation 44 fits the data well, with an R2 of 0.85 (0.86 if considering energy goods only).24
The high R2 is partially explained by large average differences in expenditures shares captured by αk .
A partial R2 measure reveals that income and price differences capture 0.323 of the variability left
unexplained by a model in which σk = 1. The F-stat on the σ parameters being significantly different
from unity indicates strongly significant non-homotheticities in consumption patterns (12.01 across
all goods, 6.69 for secondary energy goods, both with a p-value < 0.001). CRIE preferences yield
Engel curves which are close to log-linear25 which has been shown to be a good approximation of
consumer behavior in a range of contexts. Comin et al. (2015), for example, find log-linearity to hold
for broad sectors over a wide range or per capita income levels. Table 5 in the Extensions section
provides additional regression statics and a comparison to more flexible demand systems allowing for
non-linearities.
Focusing first on energy consumption, Figure 1 plots fitted and observed consumption against
per capita total expenditure for the 4 secondary energy sectors. The fit is overall good, although a
substantial amount of unexplained heterogeneity remains in the coal and, to a lesser extent, natural
gas sectors.
Figure 3 then displays the distribution of estimated ‘direct’ income elasticities εk for all sectors,
computed following equation 2 and evaluated at mean expenditure shares (income elasticity varies
across countries according to observed consumption shares). Table A.1 in Appendix contains the
underlying numerical values. These estimates exhibit considerable variability across sectors.26

5.2

Sector-level correlation of income elasticity and CO2 intensity

Before turning to the link between consumption patterns and emissions at the country level, we look at
the relationship between a sector’s income elasticity and the CO2 emissions caused by its consumption.
A sector-level relationship between these parameters provides preliminary evidence for the possibility
of a demand-side link between energy use, emissions and income levels.
24
The NLLS estimation covers 49 sectors, as we drop Dwellings, which are non-tradable and for which price indice
proxies are not available, as well as 6 intermediate good sectors which have zero or negligible shares of output going to
final demand (pdr, oil, omn, nmm, i s, nfm).
25
Caron et al. (2014) find a very high correlation between the estimated log λn and log In .
26
Our assumption of homogeneous within-country income could actually be biasing income elasticity estimates towards
one, leading us to underestimate the role of income growth: energy use in low-income countries may be driven by a small
number of high-income households, for example. The bias may not be large: using a similar framework Caron, Fally
and Markusen (2014), finds that the distribution of income elasticity estimates is only slightly larger when integrating
within-country income distributions.

Figure 2 displays the relationship between income elasticity ε̄k and average total CO2 intensity
Ctot , in logs, computed as described in equation 30.27 Both parameters vary across
coefficients β̄kF

countries, so we display average values.
The figure reveals an inverted-U pattern: sectors of intermediate income elasticity have on average
the highest CO2 intensity. But it is also asymmetric and negative overall, with high income elasticity
sectors having on average the lowest CO2 requirements. This systematic relationship between income
elasticity and CO2 intensity implies that consumers of different income levels will consume baskets of
goods with different average CO2 intensities.
Both the negative and inverted-U patterns are statistically significant. Table 2 displays the beta
coefficients resulting from regressions of (log) CO2 intensity on income elasticity. Specification (1)
is linear, and finds a negative correlation of -0.36 (p-value < 0.01). Specification (2) allows for a
quadratic term and yields coefficients consistent with an inverted-U relationship (the coefficients are
jointly significant with p-value = 0.01). Comparisons of the Akaike information criteria (AIC) show
that the non-linear specification is slightly favored.
The negative relationship partially reflects a transition away from the direct consumption of energy
as final goods, as three of the four secondary energy goods have income elasticities that are below unity
on average. This can also be seen in the last three columns of Table 1, which show income elasticity
and CO2 intensity across secondary energy sectors and non-energy sectors (an exception is natural
gas consumption, which is highly income elastic but accounts for just 3.6% of total consumption
emissions).
Beyond this, the negative and inverted-U relationship also holds — and is even stronger — when
restricted to the set of non-energy goods (middle two columns of Table 2). In broad terms, this
reflects a transition from low-income elasticity, low-CO2 intensity agricultural sectors to medium27

The relationship is plotted for the 49 sectors in the dataset which are consumed as final goods. Figure 12 in Section 6.2
displays the corresponding relationship between income elasticity, secondary energy intensity and GHG intensity.

income elasticity, high-CO2 intensity transportation28 and medium-intensity manufacturing, to highincome elasticity, low-CO2 intensity service sectors such as businesses and financial services (OBS,
OFI). The relationship is not only driven by the transition between broad sectors, as we also find a
negative (but not inverted-U) relationship within the 13 manufacturing sectors (last two columns).
Cross-country variation

For exposition purposes, we have thus far focused on average income

elasticity parameters, but estimates vary across countries because of variations in expenditure shares
(see equation 2). CRIE preferences generates income elasticity which declines with income for all
sectors. For instance, while the income elasticity of the oil and electricity sectors is below unity (0.78
and 0.81) when evaluated using average expenditure shares, their estimates vary across countries and
are above one in six of the lowest income countries.
Despite these differences, note that relative income elasticity is constant with CRIE preferences,
so the correlations with CO2 intensities displayed in Table 2 are unaffected by the choice of country.29
Cross-country differences do matter when assessing the overall direction and magnitude of the incomedriven changes in CO2 , however. Whether CRIE preferences allow for sufficient cross-country variation
will be further investigated in the Extensions Section 6.1.
Total income elasticity

Some of the sectors displayed in Figure 2 are used primarily as intermedi-

ates with only a small share of production consumed as final goods. As an alternative way of thinking
about the link between income and emissions, Figure 3 compares each sector’s income elasticity in
final consumption (defined as the “direct income elasticity”) to the income elasticity of their total
demand (or absorption). The “total income elasticity” (εtot
ih , computed as in equation 38) reflects the
income elasticity of total demand for sector k, driven not only by an increase in its own final demand
but also by an increase in the final demand of goods which use sector k as an intermediate. The
“financial services nec” sector, as an example, has a very high “direct” elasticity of 1.38. Its “total”
income elasticity is considerably lower, at 1.14, suggesting that a number of sectors with lower direct
income elasticity use it as an input.
Figure 3 helps illustrate several facts. First, while direct and total elasticities are correlated,
there is less variance in total income elasticities than direct elasticities, and the estimates exhibit
smaller deviations from unity. The structure of the input-output linkages is such that many low
income elasticity goods are required as intermediate inputs to sectors with higher income elasticity
than theirs, and conversely for many high-income elasticity sectors. This implies that changes in per
capita income will affect absorption (total demand) patterns less than final consumption patterns.30
Second, Figure 3 shows that the total income elasticity of energy goods (the first block of four
sectors) also differs from their direct elasticity. The two most important, refined oil and electricity,
28

The transportation sectors represent market-supplied transportation (ground, sea and air transportation) and does
not include household-provided transportation, which is captured by the final demand for refined oil (p c).
29
Emission intensity coefficients also vary between countries, but the correlations are robust within countries and using
averages based on various sub-groups of countries.
30
This point is related to Herrendorf et al. (2013) who find that measuring structural change on a final demand basis
yields a different relationship with per capita income than when measuring on a value added basis.

have higher total income elasticity, implying that they are used as intermediates to goods which have
on average a higher income elasticity than their own. On the contrary, natural gas has a considerably
lower total income elasticity — easily explained by the fact that it is an important input to the
production of electricity and a number of other industrial sectors with lower income elasticity. Overall,
the total income elasticity of energy is much closer to unity than its direct elasticity, so the share of
energy goods in total GDP is less sensitive to per capita income than their share in final demand.

5.3

Emissions content of consumption, production and imports

We now investigate the extent to which the above sector-level relationships translate to a countrylevel link between per capita income and the average CO2 content of consumption. Since preferences
are non-homothetic and income elasticities are linked to CO2 intensities, income levels will affect
consumption patterns in a way which systematically affects the overall energy and CO2 content of a
country’s final consumption. We also investigate the relationship between income and the emissions
content of production and imports.
Figure 4 displays the country-level CO2 content of consumption, ECndir , ECnindir , ECntot , and of
production, EYn (Equations 31 to 35), expressed as averages (i.e. as intensities, in kg CO2 /$) by
dividing them by the value of total expenditure. They are plotted as a function of log per capita
expenditure (which in most regions is close to per capita income), the dashed line representing a

Figure 4: Average CO2 content in the data
the fitted prediction from a quadratic least-squares regression (a functional form commonly used in the
literature to represent this relationship). The average values for the total CO2 content of consumption
are around three times as large as those of direct consumption, consistent with the fact that a large
part of consumption emissions are indirect.
Similar to the cross-sector relationships, the country-level relationship between income and the
average direct, indirect and total CO2 contents of consumption (Figures 4a, 4b and 4c) follow a
distinct inverted-U pattern with an overall negative trend. Indeed, the quadratic fit follows the nonparametric local regression fit quite closely. For all three, the coefficients of either a linear regression
(negative) or a quadratic regression (inverted-U) are significant with p-values smaller than 0.01.
Differences in intensities between income levels are substantial. Classifying countries according to
per capita income, we find that the (weighted) average CO2 intensity of direct consumption is 0.21
kg/$ for low-income countries, 0.266 kg/$ for lower-middle-income countries, 0.158 kg/$ for uppermiddle-income countries, and only 0.063 kg/$ for high-income countries. For the total CO2 content,

28

variations are also substantial: 0.789, 1.190, 0.654 and 0.365. We should also note that the shape
of the quadratic and non-parametetric curves suggest that intensities peak at relatively low levels of
income.
There is, however, a lot of variability around these patterns not explained by per capita income
levels, and R-squared values from the quadratic regressions are fairly low: 0.11, 0.20 and 0.17 for direct,
indirect and total consumption. Thus, although the average CO2 content significantly co-varies with
per capita income levels, most of the variability across countries is not explained by income, at least
in reduced-form. Finally, Figure 4d shows that the average CO2 content of production also follows an

Isolating the role of consumption patterns and per-capita income

The cross-country variability observed in Figure 4 reflects more than differences in consumption patterns. In order to isolate their role, we compute weighted average (across countries) direct and total

ECnimp and EYn . Using average production CO2 intensities at the sector level neutralizes differences
in production technologies across countries, within-sector heterogeneity (types of goods, differences in
quality) and the role of trade (the sourcing of goods).
In a second step, we investigate the predictive power of per capita income as a determinant, through
its influence on consumption patterns, of the CO2 content of consumption. For this, we use fitted
consumption vectors from the CRIE demand system, computed under the assumption of identical but
non-homothetic preferences (as estimated in equation 44). In order to distinguish the effect of supplydriven price differences from that of per capita income, consumption is also fitted with homothetic
preferences by imposing σk = σ in equation 44. Thus, three types ∆ ∈ {data, homoth, non-homoth}
of consumption values Dnk are defined:

correlation between the observed average CO2 content (the solid line in Figure 5) and the fitted values
(the dashed lines) computing using average production intensities and variations in consumption
patterns.
The role of consumption patterns Differences in consumption patterns contribute to the observed inverted-U relationship between the CO2 content of consumption and per capita income. Similarly to observed values, fitted values evaluated using observed consumption patterns but constant
production intensities (∆ = data) exhibit an inverted-U relationship with per capita income with a
negative overall trend for the direct (Figure 5a), indirect (Figure 5c) and the total (Figure 5b) CO2
content. In each case, the coefficients of either linear or quadratic coefficients significantly describe
negative or inverted-U relationships (p-values < 0.01).

driven by consumption patterns can also be confirmed in Table 3. Using observed consumption
patterns but average intensities yields estimates which are well correlated with observed values, with
correlation coefficients of 0.826, 0.654 and 0.721 for the direct, indirect and total CO2 content.
Finally, differences in consumption patterns also contribute to explaining why production emissions
EYn decrease with per capita income (see Figure 5d).
The role of non-homotheticity We then investigate the extent to which per capita income determines CO2 contents through its role in changing consumption patterns (and thus, whether it can
be used as a predictor of emissions). To see this, Figure 5 also displays the average CO2 contents
obtained with average production technologies and fitted consumption patterns.
As a point of comparison, we first consider consumption patterns fitted under the assumption
of homothetic preferences (green medium-dotted line in Figure 5). These vary according to price
differences but not income. They generate a weakly decreasing relationship between average direct,
indirect and total CO2 content of consumption and per capita income. This suggests that the crosscountry price differences estimated in the gravity framework are correlated with CO2 intensity: CO2 intensive goods are on average relatively cheaper in low-income countries and more expensive in
high-income countries. This effect is moderate, however, and Table 3 shows that the resulting fitted
CO2 content is only 29.7% (for direct) and 38.6% (for total) correlated with observed content.
Relaxing the assumption of homothetic preferences — that is, allowing per capita income to
determine consumption patterns — significantly increases the correlation between fitted content and
observed content: from 29.7% to 50.8% for direct; 38.2% to 63.0% for indirect; and 38.6% to 62.6%
for total. These can be compared to the 82.6%, 65.4% and 72.1% correlations obtained with observed
consumption patterns. The average CO2 content declines significantly faster with income under nonhomothetic preferences (see the orange small-dashed line in Figure 5). For the indirect CO2 content,
the relationship is very similar to that obtained with observed consumption. However, while the model
captures the negative trend observed for middle- and high-income countries, it fails to capture the
increase in average content at very low incomes.
Again grouping countries by per capita income level, we find the magnitude of the income effect
predicted by the model to be substantial: the (weighted) average CO2 intensity of total consumption
is 0.733 kg/$ for low-income countries, 0.613 kg/$ for middle-income, and 0.461 kg/$ for high-income
countries, in each case evaluated using average production intensities.

Figure 6: Average CO2 content of imported consumption
Measure of fit and summary

As an alternate way of describing the role of consumption patterns

and non-homotheticity in determining cross-country patterns in emissions, we compute a measure of
fit, R2pseudo , which summarizes the share of variance in each true CO2 content measure explained by
d n 31 Focusing on the total CO2 content, we obtain an R2pseudo of
their different fitted equivalents EC
0.336 when using observed consumption patterns and average production intensities. In other words,
the fact that consumers in different countries chose to consume different baskets of goods explains
one third of the large observed differences in the total CO2 intensity of consumption (for direct
CO2 emissions, the equivalent R2pseudo is even higher and equals 0.673). Any model which ignores
differences in consumption patterns (or any predictive exercise which fails to account for the evolution
of these patterns due to growth in per capita income) will fail to account for 34% of the variability in
the CO2 emissions embodied in consumption.
In turn, much of this variability can be explained by non-homothetic preferences. Using the fitted
non-homothetic consumption patterns from our model explains more than two thirds of this variance,
with an R2pseudo of 0.239. Conversely, imposing homothetic preferences yields an R2pseudo of 0.101
only. We conclude that per capita income explains a substantial part of the variability in the average
CO2 content of consumption across countries through its influence on consumption patterns. This
conclusion also holds for total and indirect emissions in consumption, as depicted in Figures 5a and 5c,
but to a smaller extent since income effects are weaker for intermediate goods demand (as emphasized
in Section 5.2, total income elasticities tend to be closer to unity than direct elasticities).
Imported consumption

Finally, we consider the role of income and consumption patterns in deter-

mining the CO2 content of imported consumption and display EC Imp (eq. 35) and its decompositions
in Figure 6b. The fact that high-income countries “outsource” the production of CO2 -intensive goods,

making them net importers of CO2 on average, is an important and well documented phenomenon
sometimes referred to as the pollution-heaven hypothesis (Copeland and Taylor, 2005). We confirm
a variant of this hypothesis using our model and multi-regional input-output dataset: the share of
imported CO2 in consumption within total CO2 in consumption is U-shaped with both the lowestand highest-income countries importing the largest shares of the CO2 they consume.
In addition, we identify a new mitigating mechanism: within imported consumption, the average
CO2 content declines with per capita income. In other words, the goods imported by higher income
countries are less CO2 -intensive than those imported by lower income countries. The solid line in
Figure 6b shows the observed relationship with income to be quite strong. Again evaluating with
average technologies, we find most of the downward trend to be explained by the fact that highincome countries import from countries with on average less CO2 -intensive technologies (as evidenced
by the large difference between the solid and dashed lines). However, once again, consumption patterns
also contribute to the downward slope, part of which is generated by non-homotheticity. The effect
here is mostly significant for the lowest- and highest-income countries: it is fairly flat for the middle
section of the per capita income spectrum.
To summarize, consumers in rich countries indeed import more of the CO2 they consume, but
also have preferences which make their imports less CO2 intensive. Our model would thus predict a
weaker “pollution-heaven” effect than standard models with homothetic preferences.

5.5

Simulating a counterfactual increase in per capita income

Having established per capita income as a important determinant of CO2 emissions contents, we
now investigate the potential for further income growth to reduce energy use and emissions through
a shift in consumption patterns, absent any other change in production functions (technology) and
endowments. We simulate growth in per capita income by introducing an exogenous shock which
increases total factor productivity z by one percent. In this context, a world economy with homothetic
preferences would see a one percent homogeneous increase in emissions in all countries, making it a
natural benchmark to highlight the role of non-homotheticities.
In section 3.2, we have described how uniform TFP growth across all sectors in all countries affects
emissions intensity in partial equilibrium approximations. Here, we use the full general equilibrium
model and parameter estimates described in Section 2 to simulate income growth and estimate the
elasticity of emissions to income. Simulated values should be interpreted as general equilibrium elasticities as they are the outcome of counterfactual simulations which capture the response of supply
to the demand shock. General-equilibrium feedback effects include price responses for all sectors and
all factors: for example, a reduction in the relative consumption of energy goods (both as final goods
and intermediates) is mitigated by a decrease in their relative prices. They also include trade-related
effects: for instance, reductions in the price of energy goods in rich countries is mitigated by increasing
demand in low-income countries. Counterfactual equilibria are obtained by formulating equations 18
to 27 as a system of non-linear equations in GAMS which is solved numerically using the non-linear

33

PATH solver.32
Calibration of energy supply elasticity Changes in total demand for fossil fuels ultimately
depends on the supply and demand equilibrium. While we want to illustrate the role of the demandside, specifically a demand shock which affects relative consumption shares across sectors, changes in
the equilibrium level of emission thus also depend on the response of fossil fuel supply. Obtaining
precise estimates of the price elasticity of supply of gas, oil and coal for all the countries in our dataset
is beyond the scope of this paper. While the literature has made some attempts at estimating such
elasticities, cleanly identified estimates are scarce, and ultimately depend on the time-scale under
consideration. Nevertheless, a survey of the literature suggests that response to prices is low, with
long-run estimates generally lying between 0.5 and 1 for oil and coal, while estimates for natural gas
have sometimes been slightly larger than unity.33 In our benchmark simulations, we chose to calibrate
the supply elasticity of all three fuels to 0.75 — an arbitrary but plausible value in line with the
long-run nature of our simulation exercise. This value generates relatively low supply-side response
in terms of quantities and large response in terms of prices on the fossil fuel markets. To examine
sensitivity to this assumption, we also provide results generated with a higher supply elasticity of 1.5,
a value possibly consistent with supply response in the very long run.

Simulation results The simulated change in emissions, EC
n and EC n , are displayed in Figures
7a and 7b in terms of elasticities to income. A value of one in Figure 7 implies that per capita income
and the CO2 content of consumption increase at the same rate, so the CO2 intensity of consumption
is insensitive to income. This would be the case for all countries if preferences were homothetic, as
uniform productivity growth across sectors and factors (including fossil fuel resource factors) would
increase income and consumption but not affect the relative demand for each sector.
Figure 7a reveals that the income elasticity of the average direct CO2 content of consumption to
income is substantially below one for all but a handful of lowest-income countries. Estimates range
from 1.036 for Ethiopia to 0.839 for Hong-Kong. For the USA, the country with the world’s largest
share of direct CO2 emissions, the elasticity is 0.856. The weighted average for the world is 0.882,
implying that a 1% increase in per capita income in all countries would reduce the average direct CO2
content of consumption by about 0.12%. Importantly, the reduction in CO2 intensity is consistently
stronger in high-income countries: their average elasticity is 0.867, while it is 0.897 for middle-income
and 0.954 for low-income countries. The average world elasticity is thus likely to decrease as incomes
converge towards high-income country levels.
Turning to the total CO2 content of consumption in Figure 7b — the most relevant metric from a
policy perspective — results are qualitatively similar but weaker. This is consistent with the findings
that the total income elasticity of energy is closer to one than its direct elasticity. In 36 of the 109
32

Fitted values are used for all baseline equilibrium outcomes (Dnk , Ynk , etc...) to insure consistency with the model.
Similar results are obtained using observed values.
33
More generally, Fally and Sayre (2017) survey the literature and find that most estimates of supply elasticity for
primary commodities tend to be lower than unity.

countries, the simulated elasticities are above one, implying that the total CO2 intensity of their
consumption will further grow with income as they are still shifting their consumption towards more
CO2 intensive goods. This is consistent with the inverted-U pattern described in Section 5.4. Values
are also higher than one in a few high-income countries such as Finland, Sweden and Japan, in
most cases because of high consumption of natural gas. But as with the direct CO2 content, there
is an overall declining relationship with income: most high-income countries are predicted to see
their emission intensities decline, with for instance an elasticity of 0.963 for the USA. The average
elasticity for high-income countries is 0.977, while it is 0.983 for middle-income and 1.021 for lowincome countries. The weighted average elasticity for the world is 0.979 (this corresponds to the
income elasticity of production emissions as well). Thus, changes in consumption patterns resulting
from a 1% increase in per capita income would decrease total emission intensity by 2.1% relative to
models with homothetic preferences.
We have so far focused on the income elasticity of the aggregate CO2 content of consumption
(Figure 7). Figure A.3 in Appendix compares it to the income elasticity of production emissions,
d n . The two metrics are overall very similar in levels but low- and high-income countries tend to
EY
see their consumption emissions rise more than their production emissions. The opposite is true for
middle-income countries, who see an increase in their net exports of emissions.
Fossil fuel supply response

As a robustness test, Figure 8 compares estimates resulting from a

price elasticity of fossil fuel supply calibrated to 0.75 (as in Figure 7) to an elasticity of 1.5. Doubling
the fossil fuel supply elasticity increases the strength of the shift in demand away from energy, but
the difference is small: the world average income elasticity is 0.860 instead of 0.882 for the direct CO2
content and 0.962 instead of 0.979 for the total CO2 content. Aside from the downward adjustment,
the distribution of effects between countries is very similar to our baseline counterfactual with a

lower supply elasticity. This suggests that world markets in energy and energy-intensive goods are
sufficiently integrated to mostly decouple the demand shocks from supply response across countries.34
In our benchmark counterfactual, the productivity of the natural resource factor specific to each
fossil fuel also increases, similarly to all production factors, which implies no effect on CO2 intensities
when preferences are homothetic. As a robustness check, we simulate a productivity shock in all but
the fossil fuel sectors. This represents a world in which fossil fuel scarcity (and thus their relative
price) increases, so that structural change is driven by more than just the demand effect. Figure
A.4 in Appendix displays our simulation results with homothetic and non-homothetic preferences
as well as the difference between the two. In this case the simulated elasticity of total CO2 to
income is smaller than unity (0.806 for the world) even with homothetic preferences. The difference
between non-homothetic and homothetic preferences is however very similar to what occurs with
resource productivity growth, suggesting that interactions between rising relative costs of energy and
the income effect are not important. The average world elasticity is again slightly lower with nonhomothetic preferences, at 0.778. While the results differ from country-to-country (especially for some
small resource producing countries), the negative relationship with income persists (and is actually
slightly stronger).

If countries were in complete autarky, low supply elasticity would push the income elasticity of CO2 towards one in

of other goods and factors. Interested primarily in the effect of shifting consumption patterns, we
compute approximations assuming infinite supply elasticity (ζ = ∞). This isolates the consumption
shift mechanism which is a function of the correlation between income elasticity and the share of each
sector in consumption emissions. The figure shows that while there are country-to-country differences
between the approximated and simulated elasticity, the approximation is overall very good (the average
level is closer to zero in general equilibrium because of the calibrated supply elasticity). This suggests
that while general equilibrium modeling is necessary to capture rich patterns of variability in estimates
across countries, the broad patterns of the demand effect can be estimated by a simple correlation
formula which only requires knowledge of income elasticity and a measure of consumption-related
emissions per sector (see equations 40 and 41).
Decomposition by sector The partial equilibrium approximations of the total emissions contents
d total ) can also be used to decompose the correlation driving the consumption effect. Table 4

so for a subset of countries and shows weighted average values for low-, middle- and high-income
countries and for the world. As the numbers do not include the effect of productivity growth (log ẑ),
summing across sectors yields changes in the average CO2 intensity of consumption, not emission
levels (numbers would sum up to zero in the homothetic case with no income-driven consumption
shifts).
The approximated average for the world as whole is -0.059 (last column), implying that an increase
in productivity leads to a moderate decrease in the CO2 intensity of consumption. Direct energy
consumption would contribute to more than half of that decline (elasticity of -0.036), driven by
reductions in electricity and refined oil (-0.021 and -0.017) despite a positive but negligible contribution
from natural gas. Emissions embodied in non-energy goods contribute -0.023 to the elasticity — about

37

40% of the total. Reductions caused by shifts away from agriculture (-0.023) and transportation (0.013) outweigh increases in emissions embodied in manufacturing and services.35
Sectoral contributions also vary significantly across income levels. In low-income countries, shifts
in the patterns of non-energy good consumption lead to an increase in CO2 intensity. In Ethiopia, for
example, the only broad non-energy sector which contributes to a decline in intensities is agriculture.
Both refined oil and electricity contribute to reductions in intensities even in middle-income countries
(including China). In high-income countries, all broad non-energy sectors except services contribute to
reductions in intensities. Interestingly, the contribution of (direct) energy consumption decreases substantially as income increases (from 73% in middle-income countries to 52% in high-income countries):
shifts in the composition of non-energy consumption will be increasingly important in the long-run.

Extensions

We now extend the results described in Section 5 along two dimensions: i) using a more flexible demand
system to test the robustness of results to the functional form imposed by Constant Relative Income
Elasticity (CRIE) preferences; and ii) going beyond CO2 to investigate the effect of consumption
patterns on additional greenhouse gases and secondary energy demand.

6.1

Alternative specifications with more flexible Engel curves

CRIE preferences yield a wide distribution of income elasticity estimates with a relatively parsimonious
functional form. Resulting Engel curves are close to log-linear which provides a good approximation of
behavior in many sectors. For some goods, however, Engel curves may follow more complex patterns.
For energy goods, for instance, there is empirical evidence of income elasticity varying considerably
across the income spectrum (Cao et al., 2016 and Gertler et al., 2016 among others).
Non-homothetic CES We test the importance of allowing for richer income effects by estimating “Non-homothetic CES” (NH CES) preferences based on implicitly-additive utility, developed in
Hanoch (1975) and more recently used in Comin et al. (2015). While imposing constant elasticity
of substitution across goods, they allow for more flexible Engel curves. Utility Un for consumers in
country n is implicitly defined as the solution of:
X  Qnk 
gk (Un )

σ−1
σ

=1

(45)

k

Combining with the budget constraint, we obtain the following expression for expenditures in good k
in country n:
1−σ
Xnk = Qnk Pnk = gk (Un )1−σ Ln eσn Pnk
35

(46)

At a more disaggregated level of detail (not shown in the table), we find that sectors contributing to the largest
reductions are other types of transport, recreational and other services, food products n.e.c., and construction. The
largest positive contributors are trade and retail, other business services, and motor vehicles.

38

Un plays a role similar to λn in the benchmark CRIE specification. There is no analytical expression for
P
Un , but it is the unique solution satisfying the budget constraint k Xnk = Ln en , using expression 46
for Xnk . Uniqueness is guaranteed if σ 6= 1 and gk is strictly increasing in Un , but gk (Un ) can otherwise
take any form, thus allowing for flexible Engel curves as long as σ is sufficiently different from unity.
The income elasticity of consumption is given by:
P
εgnk k0 xnk0
∂ log xnk
= σ + (1−σ) . P
g
∂ log en
k0 xnk0 εnk0
where εgnk =

∂ log gk
∂ log Un

(47)

denotes the elasticity of gk in Un . One can see that if εgnk is constant across

goods, preferences are homothetic.36 This implicit utility function does not impose any link between
income elasticity and price elasticity (σ), unlike directly-separable utility functions such as CRIE
where income elasticity is proportional to price elasticity across sectors for any country.
We consider three alternative specifications for gk (Un ). First, a “log-linear” case with gk (Un ) =
k −σ

αk Un1−σ (the main case emphasized in Comin et al., 2015) which yields:
1−σ
Xnk = αk Ln eσn Unk −σ Pnk

(48)

It is very similar to our baseline specification, except that price elasticities are constant and equal to
σ across all sectors. We also estimate two “augmented” specifications which allow for more flexible
Engel curves while remaining parsimonious:
Shifter NH CES:
Quadratic NH CES:

log gk (U ) = log αk + ρk log(Un + bk )

(49)
2

log gk (U ) = log αn + ρk log Un − bk (log U )

(50)

where in each case bk is a constant parameter for each sector k. The first introduces a sector-specific
“shifter” bk , which plays a similar role as in Stone-Geary preferences, Simonovska (2015), and others.
Depending on the sign of bk , εgnk may be either decreasing or increasing in Un , i.e. decreasing or
increasing in income. The second introduces a quadratic form. This case is more simple with the
caveat that gk must remain increasing in Un (gk (Un ) can be replaced by a flat portion if log Un >
Estimation

ρk
2bk ).

We estimate these preferences using the same data as in the benchmark with CRIE

preferences and follow the same approach to identify the unobserved country variable Un (similar to
λn ).37 We calibrate trade elasticity θ to be equal to 4, a common value in the literature.38
Table 5 displays regression statistics for the three NH CES specifications and compares them to
the estimation of CRIE, while Figure 9 displays fitted consumption and implied income elasticties for
36
These preferences are homothetic if σ = 1 and close to homothetic if σ ≈ 1. If σ < 1, the income elasticity has a
lower bound at σ, since εgnk > 0 for all sectors k. If σ > 1 the income elasticity has an upper bound at σ.
37
That is, we estimate a constrained regression imposing the budget constraint to determine Un . One could also treat
Un as a free parameter for each country: this alternative approach yields similar estimates (as it does for CRIE).
38
Contrary to CRIE in which θ is identified in each sector using the restrictions on price and income elasticity, there
is no explicit link between the elasticities in non-homothetic CES preferences so we chose to calibrate θ.

The overall fit, reflected by the R2 statistic, is similar

across specifications. The partial R2, AIC and BIC suggest CRIE to be preferable despite additional
parameters. Focusing on the role of non-homotheticity, however, the partial R2 and Figure 9b show the
two “augmented” specifications with flexible forms (columns 3 and 4) slightly improve the fit relative
to the log-linear NH CES. The bk coefficients (flexible Engel terms) are jointly significant in both cases,
but the increase in fit is driven by a subset of sectors — most bk ’s are not individually significant. The
information criteria are not conclusive as to whether the inclusion of additional parameters (relative
to log-linear NH CES) is justified, as AIC is lower but not BIC.
Added flexibility is more important for energy goods, however. The F-stat of joint significance of
the flexible (quadratic or shifter) Engel terms (the bk ’s) is considerably higher than for all goods taken
together. Their inclusion significantly changes the variation in income elasticities for energy goods,
more than tripling the difference between the average income elasticity of energy goods in all countries
versus low-income countries (below the median per capita income): 0.92 relative to 0.88 for CRIE;
0.92 relative to 0.73 for NH CES quadratic. Hence, while CRIE provides a good fit for most sectors,
we conclude that having more flexible income effects may be desirable for energy goods. There is no
substantial difference between the performance of the “quadratic” or “shifter” specifications, so we
chose the quadratic specification for subsequent results unless otherwise indicated.
39

Note that we estimate the price elasticity σ to be fairly high (3.15) compared to Comin et al. (2015) for instance.
This can be explained by the larger number of sectors in our sample, as aggregation tends to be associated with lower
estimates. Higher elasticities also improve the fit of income effects with the implicit utility approach: as noted in
equation 47, income elasticity is bounded by the price elasticity.

Improvements in the estimation of the income-consumption-CO2 relationship

Cross-

specification differences are obvious when looking at the resulting income elasticity estimates of energy
goods in Figure 9b: differences in income elasticity between rich and poor countries are larger for the
augmented specifications (Shifter and Quadratic NH CES). This does not substantially affect the
cross-sector relationship between income elasticity and CO2 intensity (evaluated at world average income), but leads to significant differences across countries. Figure 10 plots the relationship between
per capita income and the average direct and total CO2 contents of consumption for each demand
specification. All curves are evaluated using average production intensities to focus on the role of
consumption patterns. Log-linear NH CES and CRIE preferences yield very similar curves. However,

replicates the results of Figure 7, displaying EC
n and EC n with augmented quadratic NH CES
preferences. Relative to CRIE, the income effect is stronger and the difference between low- and highincome countries considerably more significant for the direct CO2 intensity of consumption. A much
larger group of countries have elasticity estimates above 1 and low-income countries as a whole have
a weighted elasticity of 1.059 (up from 0.954 for CRIE). High-income countries have a much lower
elasticity, at 0.715 (compared to 0.867). The world average, overall, is also lower at 0.812 (compared
to 0.882). Comparing elasticities across all NH CES specifications (Figure A.5), we find that the
“augmented” terms drive these differences: NH CES preferences, in their standard log-linear form, do
not otherwise provide results which differ substantially from CRIE.
Results for the total CO2 content are closer to CRIE on average, but “augmented” specifications
again yield larger differences across countries (Figure 11b). The range between high- and low-income
countries is 10% (1.050 to 0.952) with quadratic NH CES, compared to 5% (1.021 to 0.977) with
CRIE (see Appendix Figure A.5 for other specifications). Similar conclusions are obtained with

Beyond CO2 : effects on secondary energy demand and other greenhouse gases.

Secondary energy demand

Section 5.2 has documented the relationship between income, con-

sumption patterns and CO2 emissions. We now focus directly on the final demand for secondary
energy, which in itself can be of interest to a variety of stakeholders, as fossil fuels are exhaustible and
energy is associated with a number of production and consumption externalities beyond CO2 . These
include local pollutants (SO2 , NOx ) but also externalities associated with non-fossil fuel electricity
production such as nuclear waste disposal, flooding caused by hydroelectricity generation, etc.
Figure 12a displays the relationship between income elasticity (reverting back to CRIE preferences)
and the log total secondary energy intensity (expressed in kg of “oil equivalent” energy per $) across
sectors. While CO2 , in our model and data, is associated with fossil fuel use, there are some differences
between CO2 and secondary energy intensity. Fossil fuels vary in the amount of CO2 emitted per unit
of energy delivered (coal for instance is significantly more CO2 intensive). Electricity has higher energy
content, as it is produced using a mix of primary energy sources, each emitting different amounts of
CO2 , including some, like nuclear, solar or wind, emitting none. The chemicals sector also has slightly
higher secondary energy than CO2 intensity, as it transforms some fossil fuels without burning them.
Overall, though, differences are small: the correlation between CO2 and secondary intensity across
sectors is 0.990. Figure 12a reveals a negative and inverted-U pattern similar to that found with CO2
and Table 6 confirms that the relationships are statistically significant. All of our results regarding

Other greenhouse gases (GHG)

CO2 is the most prevalent GHG and thus the primary driver of

global climate change. Being directly proportional to fossil fuel use, it is the most easily measurable
GHG with reliable emissions data available for a large range of countries. We now investigate the
relationship between income and a larger set of GHGs, including not only CO2 but methane, nitrous
oxides and fluorinated greenhouse gases (CH4 , N2 O and F -gases), which are caused mostly by energy
and agricultural production. The data describing non-CO2 GHG exhibit extremely large variance in
country-level intensities, so we decide to restrain our analysis to the use of sector-level averages.
The inclusion of non-CO2 gases significantly increases the average GHG-intensity of some sectors,
particularly agricultural sectors such as cattle, cattle meat, raw milk or processed rice, but also, to
a smaller extent, some manufacturing sectors such as chemicals. The intensity of energy goods is
mostly unaffected. As is clear in Figure 12b, intensity in non-CO2 GHGs is heavily biased towards
low-income elasticity sectors and the inverted-U relationship across sectors disappears in favor of a
strongly negative relationship (see bottom of Table 6: the quadratic term does not improve the fit).
This translates to country-level patterns. Figure 13 plots per capita income and the average total
GHG content of consumption — all evaluated at average production intensities. As with CO2 , observed
consumption patterns create an inverted-U curve, but its peak occurs at considerably lower income
levels. The magnitude of the composition of consumption effect is stronger than when considering
CO2 on its own: evaluated at average technologies, the average GHG content of consumption (in
CO2 -equivalent kg/$) is 1.366 for low-income countries, 0.858 for middle-income countries and 0.602
for high-income countries (equivalent values for CO2 are 0.732, 0.663 and 0.509).

curve. They capture a larger part of the variation between income levels than with CO2 (from 1.011
kg/$ for low-income countries to 0.583 for high-income countries), in part because the shift away from
agriculture is well captured by non-homothetic preferences.

Summary and concluding remarks

This paper has analyzed the importance of consumption patterns in determining CO2 emissions across
a large number of countries covering most of the world economy and a wide range of per capita income
levels. Our framework has allowed identifying income-driven consumption effects and simulating their
impact in general equilibrium. We have found an important role for income with non-homothetic
behavior prevalent for most consumption goods including energy.
The literature, mostly based on country-specific estimates, has documented income effects in direct
energy consumption, such as rapidly rising energy demand in the developing world and the generally
low income elasticity of energy in high-income countries. Our study summarizes the situation for
many countries. While differences in the direct consumption of energy across income levels create an
inverted-U relationship between the average CO2 content of a country’s consumption and its level of
income, the effect is overall negative: high-income countries consume less energy and CO2 per dollar.
Differences are quantitatively important, especially when estimated with flexible Engel curves.
More unique is our inclusion of the emissions embodied in the consumption of non-energy goods.
Indirect emissions correspond to a large share (73%) of consumption emissions — so clearly matter
— and taking them into account considerably reduces the quantitative role of income. Indeed, the
structure of technology as reflected by the input-output tables is such that the total income elasticity
of energy is closer to one than its direct income elasticity: CO2 -emitting energy goods exhibit low
income elasticity of consumption, but are used as intermediates for high income elasticity goods.
45

Thus, energy goods correspond to rapidly decreasing shares of consumer expenditures, but the total
energy embodied in consumption does not decrease as strongly with income, contrary to what could
be inferred from single-country studies focused on direct energy demand.
Despite this, income effects remain significant: total demand for energy has an income elasticity
that is lower than one on average, driven by a negative correlation between income elasticity and
total CO2 intensity across sectors. The shape of the cross-country patterns in emissions can therefore
be replicated by consumption shares generated by non-homothetic preferences. Per capita income
explains about half of the variability in the total CO2 contents of consumption left unexplained by
a model with homothetic preferences, and can thus be used as a predictor of consumption-driven
changes in emissions.
With this finding in hand, we simulate the response of world CO2 emissions to income growth.
Consumption effects are large for the direct CO2 content of consumption: its world elasticity to
income is 0.812-0.882 (on average across all countries) depending on the specification of preferences.
Consistent with cross-sector findings, the impact of income growth on total emissions is weaker: the
income elasticity of the total world CO2 contents of consumption (and thus of production) is 0.96-0.97
— it will increase only 3% to 4% slower than increase in income. Results for total emissions are robust
to using alternative demand systems, while direct emissions are more sensitive to modeling choices.
Despite the near-homothetic aggregate effect for the world, our results indicate a very heterogeneous
role for income growth across countries: the income elasticity of CO2 contents is considerably lower in
high-income countries, both for the direct and total contents. The decarbonising effect of consumption
patterns thus has the potential to grow stronger in the long run when all or most countries pass peak
intensity levels. Finally, while we focus on well-measured CO2 emissions, our estimates suggest a
stronger income effect if non-CO2 greenhouse gases are accounted for: income-inelastic (necessity)
goods are particularly intensive in these gases.
Our findings indicate that ’consumption-driven’ booms in emissions in the lowest-income countries
are likely limited in scope and maybe be compensated by reductions in high-income countries. On
the other hand, there is no silver bullet: consumption-driven decarbonisation will not be nearly
quick enough to solve the climate change problem on its own. While our findings are important for
anticipating future global emission levels, they also have further implications for policy: the relative
demand for energy is shifting towards low-income countries and from direct to indirect consumption.
CO2 reduction efforts should be designed accordingly.

Supply elasticity of primary energy goods

This section describes the steps leading to the equation describing the supply elasticity of primary
energy goods k ∈ P in countries i. We hold wages constant (treating mobile inputs as infinitely elastic)
but account for changes in the cost of natural resource factors (entering fossil fuel production).
Equation 16 yields:

As the output price pik depends on χβikik (taking other input prices as given), we need to multiply
the inverse supply elasticity by βik :

Analytical approximations of Section 3

Under the assumption that the productivity increase zb augments all factors of production in all

nk corresponds to z

the cost of non-resource factors w

nf ≈ 0 (assuming that the share of resource factors is negligible).

We obtain that Sc

remain constant. In addition, direct input-output coefficients are determined by the Cobb-

Douglas upper tier, hence both global and domestic linkage coefficients remain constant as a first-order
approximation.

Next, we describe the steps leading to equation 36. Taking P

nk ≈ z
holding nominal income constant and using equation 18, we get:
