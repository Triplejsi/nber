Multinational

Firms and Manufactured Exports from

Developing

Countries

ABSTRACT

Multinational

firms have played an important role in leading the developing

countries into world markets. Multinationals from the United States, Japan and
Sweden have all increased their shares of LDC exports of manufactures since the

mid—1960s or •id—1970s. Their importance was particularly notable in Latin
America, while their role in the Asian NICs decreased.

The comparative advantages of U.S. and Swedish multinationals' affiliates in
developing countries resembled those of their home countries more than those of
their host countries, while Japanese affiliates' exports are more similar to
those of their host countries. There are some cases in which the advantage of
the multinationals as exporters seems to be that they are able to combine company comparative advantages with the location advantages of producing in the
developing countries.

1. Introduction
The encouragement of foreign direct investment in export industries is
often urged upon developing countries as a key to entering world markets.
However, the major empirical work on the question, a study by Nayyar
(1978), concluded that multinationals had not been increasing their role in

developing countries' exports of manufactures. He reported that the share
of U.S. multinationals (by far the major investors) in total developing

country exports of manufactures fell from 10.6 to 8.7 per cent between 1966
and 1974 and that their share in Latin American exports of manufactures

fell even more steeply -—

from 38 to about 19 per cent in the same period.

For several reasons another look at this issue may be worthwhile. A
decade has passed since that conclusion was reached, developing countries'

export prospects are still questionable, and a substantial amount of new
and revised data on multinationals' operations have become available. In

—2addition to multinationals from the United States, our investigation also
covers firms from Japan and Sweden.

2. U.S. Multinationals
The basic fact about the share of U.S. multinationals in developing
country exports of manufactures is that it has increased substantia1ly
since the 1950s and, contrary to Nayyar's findings, since the 1960s as well

(Table 1). U.S. majority—owned foreign affiliates (MOFAs)l raised their
share in developing-country exports of manufactures by 58 per cent between
1966 and 1983 and more than doubled it between 1957 and 1983.

1Export data are not collected for U.S. foreign affiliates that are
minority-owned.

The role of U.S. firms in Third World exports varied widely among

industries and countries. As can be seen in Table 2, it was much greater
in chemicals, transport equipment, and machinery than in foods, metals, and

other manufacturing (largely textiles and apparel). In machinery and
transport equipment the U.S. companies shares more than doubled between
1966 and 1977, reaching over 30 and 14 per cent, but they receded somewhat
by 1983.

The combination of rising MOFA shares overall and mostly declining
shares in individual industries emphasizes the importance of shifts among

industries. The industries in which U.S. multinationals were most active
as exporters from LOCs were also the industries in which LDC exports were
rising most rapidly.

The data for individual countries reveal that U.S. multinationals'
shares of host—country exports increased both in Latin America and in developing Asia as a whole through 1982, but decreased in each of the four
Asian NICs after 1977, the only period for which we have data for them

(Table 3). However, the Asian NICs' exports were growing much faster
during these years than were those of the Latin American and other Asian

countries. The Latin American share in world exports was actually
decreasing (for details, see Blomström, 1987).

For U.S. multinationals, we can thus conclude that their role in LDC
exports of manufactures increased from the late 1950s to the early 1980s.

That increase can be factored into several elements. One was that there
were declines in shares in most industries and, in 1977 to 1983, in the
fastest growing countries. However, these declines were more than offset

by the concentration of the multinationals activities, relative to LDC
exports as a whole, in the fastest growing LDC export sector, machinery,
and in the fastest growing countries.

3.

ese Multinationals
The story for the Japanese multinationals seems to be similar to that

of the U.S. firms in many respects. As Table 4 shows, Japanese affiliates
increased their share of LDC exports of manufactures between 1974 and 1983,

-6the only two years for which data comparable to the U.S. figures are

available. Japanese multinationals played a particularly large role in the
electrical machinery industry, as did American firms, and their share in

that industry's exports increased between the 1970s and 1980s. Thus, the
increase in the overall share of Japanese multinationals in developing
countries' manufactured exports reflected the concentration of Japanese-

owned production in the very fast growing electrical machinery and
transport equipment groups, as well as in other manufacturing, which grow
at a rate slightly better than manufacturing as a whole.

The role of Japanese affiliates in Latin American manufacturing

exports, always small, increased substantially between 1974 and 1983, while
it increased only slightly in developing Asia, where it was always much

greater (Table 5). A major difference between the Japanese and U.S. multinationals is that the Japanese firms' activities were overwhelmingly concentrated in the fast-growing group of countries (Developing Asia) and

—7—
hardly at all in the slow-growing group (Latin America), while the U.S. had
a substantial stake in Latin America. The increases in the overall
Japanese share, thus, reflected their geographical concentration as well as
their industry concentration.

4. Swedish Multinationals
Swedish multinationals are fewer in number than either U.S. or Japanese

MNCs. Compared to the U.S. multinationals, Swedish MNC5 are also smaller
on average (Swedenborg, 1979), and their affiliates are less export-

oriented (Blomstrom and Lipsey, 1986). Thus, they inevitably play a much
smaller role in LOC exports. However, the trends in their activities pro-

-8—
vide an additional set of observations on multinationals' export activity
in the developing countries.

Swedish investment in developing countries is concentrated in Latin
America, the slower—growing of the two regions we compare, but exports were

much larger from other areas, particularly Africa, before 1978. There was
a rapid growth in the amount of Swedish multinationals' exports from Latin
America, almost all from Brazil, and in the share (initially extremely

small) of Swedish multinationals in Latin American exports of manufactures
(Table 6). However, there were contrasting movements in Brazil and Mexico.
In Brazil, whose share in world exports of manufactures rose between 1974

and 1978, the share of Swedish multinationals increased greatly. In
Mexico, whose share of world manufactured exports was constant, the share
of Swedish multinationals fell by almost a half.

The Comparative Advantages of Multinationals' Affiliates in Developing
Countries

A comparison of the industry distribution of exports by affiliates
based in the three countries with those of their home countries and host

countries should give some indication of the comparative advantage of the

multinational firms operating in developing countries. It should also provide an indication as to whether the comparative advantage of these affiliates reflects mainly that of their home countries, or is some combination

of the advantages of the firms and their host countries. The comparisons
are shown in Table 7.

Some conformities between a country's comparative advantages and those

of the country's LDC affiliates are evident. All three developed countries
have low shares of their exports in foods relative to the LDC5, and their

affiliates do also. The U.S. has a comparative advantage in chemicals
relative to the LOGs, Japan, and Sweden, and so do its affiliates. Japan
has the highest share of exports in metals and the U.S. the lowest, and the
same is true of their affiliates.
In machinery and transport equipment the relationships are a little
aore complicated. Non—electrical machinery is an industry in which the
three developed countries clearly have a comparative advantage relative to

the LDC5. In electrical machinery, however, the LDCs seem to have a comparative advantage relative to the U.S. and Sweden, but not relative to

Japan. But U.S.—based LDC affiliates have almost half of their exports
concentrated in this industry and Japanese affiliates a third. Thus, the
combination of U.S. and Japanese firm characteristics (mainly technology)
with LDC country characteristics (cheap labor) seems to be the optimum combination in this industry.
Transport equipment, like non—electrical machinery, is an industry in
which all three of the developed countries appear to have some comparative

advantage relative to the LDC5. U.S. and Japanese affiliates in LOGs, as
in the case of non-electrical machinery, appear to possess some comparative
advantage relative to the LDC5, but not relative to their home countries, as

was true in non—electrical machinery. However, again as with non-electrical
machinery, Swedish LOC affiliates had a strong comparative advantage relative to the home country; transport equipment accounted for close to half

— 11 —

of

exports by Swedish—based LDC affiliates. We do not try to explain the

data for other manufacturing because it is so heterogeneous, dominated, for
example, by textiles and clothing in the LDCs, and by forest products and
derivatives in Sweden.
More generally, it can be said that the distribution of exports of U.S.
and Swedish affiliates is more like that of home-country exports than that
of developing—country exports, even though these affiliates are producing

in developing countries. Japanese affiliates, however, export products
that are very different from Japanese exports and much more similar to
those of the LDCs.

There is, thus, some confirmation here that Japanese operations in
developing countries are quite different from those of other investors.

They appear to bring less of the comparative advantage of the home country
to the host country. However, a more detailed industry breakdown, particularly of "other manufacturing", would be needed to draw strong conclusions on this issue.
On the whole, the story seems to be that LDC affiliates reflect a mix-

ture of home—country and host-country attributes. There are a few cases,
however, such as U.S. and Japanese LOC affiliates in electrical machinery,
and Swedish affiliates in non—electrical machinery and transport equipment,

where the combination of company advantages and LOC country advantages produces a particularly high comparative advantage for the affiliates.

6. Conclusions
In contrast to Nayyar (1978), we find that multinational firms have
played an increasing role in leading the developing countries into world

markets of manufactured goods in recent decades. Multinationals from the
United States, Japan and Sweden all increased their share of LOC exports of

manufactures between the early 1970s and the 1980s. The increase was particularly notable in Latin America, which suggests that multinational firms

may play an important role in converting import—substituting industries to
exporting.

The experience of the Asian NIC5, on the other hand, shows that there

are possibilities of fast export expansion by firms that have no equity
participation by foreign—owned multinationals. Foreign direct investment

— 13 —

is

not necessary for successful export—oriented manufacturing. Although

the multinationals in these countries expanded their manufactured exports
rapidly, local firms' exports grew as fast, or even faster.
The industries in which the multinationals increased their exports most

rapidly were the two machinery industries and transport equipment. These
were also the industries where these firms and their home countries had
their comparative advantages relative to their host countries. Thus, if
these avenues for the expansion of manufactured exports are chosen, we
expect foreign direct investment to be an important underlying factor.
In less technologically oriented industries (such as foods, textiles,
and clothing), where the multinationals have comparative disadvantages
relative to the LOC5, locally-owned firms' exports were growing faster

than those of the multinationals. Thus, if the LDCs choose these avenues
for the expansion of manufactured exports, there seems to be less of a role

for multinationals. However, even in some of these industries, while there
is relatively little equity ownership by foreign firms, sub-contracting
arrangements with foreign multinationals may play an important part, as
Nayyar and others have noted.
The comparative advantage of U.S. and Swedish multinationals, as judged
from the industry distribution of their exports, resembled that of their
home countries more than that of their host countries, while that of

Japanese affiliates was more similar to that of the host countries. In
addition, there seemed to be some industries in which the affiliates seemed
to combine the advantages of host countries and home countries.

APPENDIX A

Definitions

and Data Sources

The data on U.S. direct investment abroad are from the 1957, 1966,
1977, 1982 and 1983 surveys of U.S. multinational enterprises (U.S.

Department of Commerce, 1960, 1975, 1981, 1985 and 1986). These are presumably quite complete censuses of U.S. direct investment abroad.
The Japanese data are from the MITI surveys (MIII, 1976 and 1986).
These surveys are not complete censuses of Japanese foreign direct invest-

ment. The proportion of firms reporting varied substantially from one survey to another. In 1974, the responses included 50.2 per cent of parents,
accounting for 78.4 per cent of the equity of companies with investment

overseas approved by the Ministry of Finance. The ratios in 1983 were 38.1
per cent of parents, accounting for 57.3 per cent of equity. In our analysis of the Japanese data, we have adjusted for the coverage.
The data on Swedish foreign investment were taken from Swedenborg (1979)

and (1982). They originate in surveys by the Industriens Utredningsinstitut
(IUI) of Stockholm. The IUI has completed four surveys of Swedish multina—
tionals covering 1965, 1970, 1974, and 1978. In general, the Swedish and
U.S. surveys are comparable.
Host—country exports, by the industry classifications used in the
direct investment surveys, were taken from the United Nations trade tapes

and converted from the SITC to this industry classification. For this conversion, we used as a guide the Classifications and Cross-Classifications,
U.S. Department of Commerce, 1974. There were some problems, however, in

— 17 —

making this adjustment. One was that no country's data contained the full
detail needed to adjust the trade figures completely. A second was that
there were variations from country to country in the degree of detail provided, and the comparisons among countries and of country data with data

for multinationals therefore are not completely consistent. Thirdly, there
were no detailed export data available for 1982 for Chile, India, Macao and
Venezuela, or for 1983 for Ecuador, India, Peru and Venezuela, so we had to

estimate them. Because the U.N. does not provide any data for Taiwan, we
used a tape from the World Bank and, for 1982 and 1983, official Taiwanese

trade data. We also adjusted U.S. export data for the underreporting of
exports to Canada.
Because of the many country differences in the commodity detail provided, the following description of the adjustments is not applicable to

every country. Some judgment had to be used in applying the desired
adjustments, listed below, to the actual data.

CThe proportion of firms reporting varied substantially from one survey to
another. In 1974, the responses included 50.2 per cent of parents, accounting
for 78.4 per cent of the equity of companies with investment overseas approved
by the Ministry of Finance. The ratios in 1983 were 38.1 per cent of parents,
accounting for 57.3 per cent of equity.
dReported figures multiplied by 100/78.4 for 1974 and by 100/57.3 for 1983. We
have no information on coverage by sector and had to assume that the same
coverage applied to all sectors.
