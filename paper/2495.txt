VAR MODELS AS STRUCTURAL APPROXIMATIONS

Ray C. Fair

Introduction
Although vector autoregressive (VAR) models have traditionally been

used for forecasting, Sims (1982) has recently advocated their use for
policy analysis.2

Sims argues that his procedures differ "marginally" from

those used for structural models in that "they take account of policy
endogeneity and they avoid constructing behavioral stories about each
individual equation in the model" (Sims, 1982, p. 150).
generality comes, of course, at a cost.
conventional exclusion restrictions,

This added

To estimate a reduced form absent

the number of variables that enter the

estimated reduced form must be very small relative to the number of
variables in the reduced form of a structural model.

Sims argues that a

small set of variables captures most of the information available to the
econometrician about the economy.
In Fair and Shiller (1987) encompassing tests were used to compare VAR

models to the structural Fair

(1976) model.

The results indicate that VAR

forecasts contain very little information not in the Fair model forecasts
and that the Fair model forecasts contain information not in the VAR

forecasts.

In this sense VAR

models

appear to be dominated by the Fair

model as forecasting devices. The present paper is, however, concerned with
11 am indebted to Matthew Shapiro for many helpful comments regarding
this paper.
2See also Doan, Litterman, and Sims (1984). Blanchard and Watson
(1986) and Bernanke (1986) use VAR models to ask questions about the
structure of the economy, but they impose restrictions on the covariance
matrix of innovations that are analogous to exclusion restrictions.

a different question from the forecasting usefulness of VAR

models.

Even if

VAR models do not aggregate Information as efficiently as do structural
models, they may still be good approximationsof the true reduced form.
This is the question examined here, namely how accurate are the structural
properties of VAR models?

Put another way, the question is how costly Is

in the economy?

The Procedure
The methodology used in this paper is as follows:

1) data are

generated from a dynamic deterministic solution of a structural model, 2) a
VAR model is estimated using a subset of these data, and 3) the properties
of the VAR model are compared to the properties of the structural model.
the properties of

theVAR model are

If

quite different from those of the

structural model, this is evidence against the VAR model being a good
approximation. If the properties are similar, this is evidence in favor of
the VAR model.

An important property of this procedure is that it eliminates the
effects of error terms.
deterministic simulation,

Because the data have been generated from a
the VAR model can fail to be a good approximation

only for two reasons. First, if the structural model is nonlinear, its
reduced form equations are nonlinear (and not necessarily analytically
tractable).

The linear or log linear specification

capture these nonlinearities.

of the VAR model may not

Second, and probably more important,

the VAR

model does not use all the predetermined variables in the structural model.
If some of the left out variables are correlatedwith the included

3

variables, the coefficient estimates of the included variables will be
wrong.

The VAR model will thus not capture the structural model's

properties if and only if the reduced form equations that it estimates are
misspecified. If the estimated reduced form equations are correct (right
functional forms and all relevant predeterminedvariables used), the VAR
model will duplicate the structural model exactly. There are no random
shocks (in the simulated data) to make the VAR model differ from the
structural model if it is correctly specified.

All the "error" is solely

from the misspecification of the VAR model.
The case of a linear structural model may help clarify the procedure.
Let the structural model be

This is just a round about way of computing the reduced form

coefficient matrix.

If, on the other hand,

Y

is regressed on a subset of

the variables in X, one will not get back the reduced form coefficient

matrix, and a perfect fit will not be achieved.

The "estimated" reduced

form will only be an approximation to the actual reduced form.

The "errors'

that are made are not due to any stochastic error terms (since the data were
generated from a deterministic simulation), but are due solely to the
misspecification of the estimated reduced form equations.

III.

The Models
The model in Fair (1984) is used as the structural model.

The model

is nonlinear, consists of 29 stochastic equations and 98 identities,

and has

over 100 predetermined variables. The version of the model used here is
estimated (by two stage least squares) for the period 1954 I
observations. The overall data set begins in 1952 I.

-

1987 I, 133

(Some observations

before 1954 1 are needed because of lagged values in the model.)

The

generated data set was constructed by simulating the Fair model dynamically
for the 1954 I -1987 I period.

The outcome of this simulation is a date set

consisting of solution values of each of the 127 endogenous variables for
each of the 133 quarters.
Three VAR models are considered in this paper.

Each consists of eight

variables: the real value of government spending (C), the import price
deflator (PM), the three-month Treasury bill rate (R), the unemployment rate
(U), the money supply (M), the nominal wage rate (W), the CNP deflator (P),

and real GNP (Y).

All but the unemployment rate and the bill rate are in

logs.

In the first model, denoted VAR4,

each

of the eight equations

consists of each variable lagged one through four times, a constant, and a
time trend, for a total of 34 coefficients per equation. This model is the

same as the model used in Sims

(1980) except for the addition of the

government spending variable and the bill rate.

For the results in the next section it is of interest to
compare the
multiplier errors that the VAR models make with the standard errors that
could be computed by the model builders.

In other words, it is of interest

to know if the system-response errors are within what the model builders
would expect from their stochastic specifications.

For VAR2 and VAR4 it is

possible to compute standard errors by stochastic simulation using the
procedure in Fair (1980).

The Government Spending Experiment

The government spending experiment was performed as follows. First, in
each VAR model the estimated residuals were added to all the equations and
taken to be exogenous.

This means that when the model is solved with no

Second, the error term in

the government spending equation (equation 1) was shocked by .016 for the

first quarter (1980 I).

The government spending equation is in logs, and

this is a shock of about 10 billion dollars at an annual rate.

$10.0 billion, but that after the first quarter the changes are different

from the initial change.

This is simply the government spending equation in

each VAR model at work.
The change in real CNP (Y) in the first quarter in response to this
shock is $6.2 billion for VAR4, $6.4 billion for VAR2, and $7.5 billion for
VAR4P.

The changes in the second quarter are, respectively, $7.7, $7.6, and

$8.9 billion.

in the unemployment rate are initially negative and then essentially zero
after about seven quarters.
The VAR properties in Table 1 need to be compared to the properties of
the structural model.

Remember that the VAR models are misspecified

because they incorrectly omit variables from the reduced form and because

they are not likely to be using the correct functional forms.

The "actual"

values in Table 1 are the properties of the Fair model when government
spending is changed by the amounts of the VAR changes in the table,

Because

each VAR model has a alightly different change in government spending after
the first quarter, the "actual" values differ slightly by model.4
The actual values vere computed as follows.

First,

the estimated

residuals in the Fair model were added to the equations and taken to be
exogenous. This means that when the model is solved using the actual values
of the exogenous variables, a perfect tracking solution is obtained.
Second,

In other words, if the VAR models were correctly specified, the

coefficients would be estimated exactly and thus the estimated covariance
matrix of the coefficient estimates would be zero.
The key question is whether the errors in Table 1 are large or small.
Although the errors can be compared to the standard errors, the answer to
this question is in part a matter of judgment.

of the VAR models seem to be close enough to the actual properties to have

would seem to be no.

For most variables, the answer from Table 1

the price and wage responses are of the wrong sign.

The money supply

responses are generally overestimated, although the interest rate and
unemployment rate responses are fairly accurate.
prices,

For GNP, wages, and

the initial errors are generally larger than the estimated standard

errors.

The Import Price Experiment
For the second experiment the error term in the import price equation
in each VAR model was shocked by .10 in the first quarter. The import price
equation is in logs, and this is a shock in the import price deflator (PM)
of 10.52 percent.

The results are presented in Table

2.

For VAR4 the

change in PM is 13.09 percent in the second quarter, and it declines to
-2.05 percent by the twelfth quarter.

This is the PM equation at work.

The

changes in PM after the first quarter are slightly different for the other
two VAR models because the PM equations are different.

2 and the model was solved.

Again, because the changes in PM differ across

VAR models after the first quarter, the actual values are slightly differen'
across models.5
Increasing the import price of deflator in the Fair model results in an
increase in wages and prices and a decrease in GNP.

The VAR models

rates to help counter the fall in output) was also missed.

The fall was not

predicted to take place until the tenth quarter.
Some of the estimated standard errors are quite large in Table

2.

For

example, the four-quarter.ahead standard error for GNP for VAR4 is $14.9
billion, which is large compared to the actual effect on CNP of -$17.0
billion,

A

model builder might conclude from the estimated standard errors

that very little confidence could be placed on the results.

The Bill Rate Experiment
The third experiment, where the error term in the bill rate equation in
each VAR model is shocked, requires a little more explanation. In the Fair
model the bill rate is determined by an interest rate reaction function,
where the Fed is estimated to "lean against the wind," Monetary policy is

Fair model, for reasons similar to those discussed in the previous footnote.

thus endogenous in the model; the Fed uses open market operations (variable
AG in the model) to achieve its bill rate target each quarter.
the bill rate are endogenous.

Both AG and

The bill rate is thus endogenous in the

generated data that have been used for the first two experiments. For the
third experiment the bill rate should be exogenous, and so a new data act
waa generated by solving the Fair model with the interest rate reaction

function dropped and the bill rate taken to be exogenous (and equal to the
historical values). Each of the three VAR models was then reestimated uaing
this data set, and these are the versions that were used for the third
experiment.

The error term in the bill rate equation in each VAR model was shocked
by 1.0 in the first quarter.

This is a shock of one percentage point.

results are presented in Table 3.

The

For VAR4 the bill rate change was 1.0 in

the first quarter, 1.22 in the second quarter, and then gradually lower
after that.

The pattern for the other two VAR models is similar.

and then it gradually diminished after that.
The actual values for the third experiment for each model were obtained
by changing the bill rate in the Fair model each quarter by the amount in
Table 3 and solving the model.

For these calculations the interest rate

reaction function was dropped from the Fair model and the bill rate was
taken to be exogenous.6 Again, the actual values differ slightly across VAR
models in Table 3 because the bill rate changes differ across models after
the first quarter.
An increase in the bill rate in the Fair model results in a contraction
6Neither government spending nor the import price deflator was changed
in the third experiment for the Fair model, which is consistent with the
treatment for the other two experiments.

in CNP from the first quarter on.

All three VAR

models,

on the other hand;

have an expansion in CNF for the first three quarters, before the
contraction sets in.

By the end of the period the contraction is

considerably overestimated by all three models.

The changes for the CNP

deflator are positive for the first ten quarters for the VAR models, wheraas
the actual values are negative. The actual changes in the unemployment rate
are positive from the first quarter on, whereas the VAR models do not pick

this up until the fifth quarter.

The results for the money supply changes

are fairly accurate.

General Remarks
What should one conclude from the results in Tables 1

results are generally fairly similar across the three VAR models.

First,

the

This

conclusion is consistent with the forecasting comparisons in Fair and
Shiller (1987), where the three VAR models performed about the same.
Second, the estimated standard errors are generally much larger for the

import price experiment than they are for the other two.

Clearly, a model

builder using a VAR model for policy analysis would put less confidence on
the response of the system to import price shocks than to government

spending or interest rate shocks.
good approximations.

Third, the VAR models do not appear to be

The errors are generally large, and many misleading

conclusions would be drawn from the responses.

A

partial exception to this

are the results for the money supply, which at times are fairly accurate.

Conclusion
This paper has presented a way of estimating how accurate VAR models

14
are likely to be for answering structural questions. The results are

generally quite negative.

The models do not

seeni

to be good structural

approximations.

The results in this paper are to some extent specific to the Fair
model, and it would be interesting in future work to see how well VAR models
approximate other structural models.

The results are not, however, as

specific to the Fair model as one might at first think.

Although the Fair

model has been assumed to be the "truth" in this study, the methodology is
not based on the assumption that the model is literally the truth.

No

comparison is ever made, or needs to be made, of the actual values and the
Fair-model predicted values. What is needed for the results in this study
to be trustworthy is that the actual way in which the data are generated in
the economy is similar to the way in which the data are generated in a large

scale structural model like the Fair model.

If instead, say, the actual

data are generated from a model like VAR2 or VAR4, then the present results
are not of much interest.

The results in Fair and Shiller (1987), however,

indicate that the data are not generated in this simple way, which thus
provides some support to the present results.
The forecasting results in Fair and Shiller (1987) and the structural
results in this paper thus call into question the usefulness of VAR models
for macroeconomic purposes.

As forecasting devices the models appear to be

dominated by the Fair model, and as structural approximations the models do
not seem to be very accurate.
