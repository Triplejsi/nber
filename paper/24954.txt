ABSTRACT
While the relationship between adverse health shocks and health care utilization has been studied
extensively, next to nothing is known about the effect of health shocks on religiosity, which may
serve as an alternative to secular psychological services and interventions. Filling this gap in
knowledge is important given that religious-based psychological counseling services have grown
substantially in recent decades, and the relative mental health benefits of religion as compared to
secular counseling services are not well-known. This study uses the setting of war to study the
impact of health trauma on religiosity. Exploiting the administrative procedures by which U.S.
Armed Forces senior commanders conditionally randomly assign active-duty servicemen to war
deployments as a natural experiment, we find that post-9/11 combat exposure substantially
increases the probability that a serviceman subsequently attends religious services and engages in
private prayer. Estimated effects are largest for enlisted servicemen, those under age 25, and
servicemen wounded in combat. The physical and psychological health effects of war, as well as
the presence of military chaplains in combat zones, emerge as partial mechanisms to explain
increases in religiosity. We find only weak evidence that combat service differentially affects
servicemen’s demand for religious counseling as compared to secular psychological services.

1. Introduction
“[F]or many trauma survivors, spirituality may be a resource that can be associated with
resilience and recovery. However, for some, the circumstances of the trauma may lead to
the questioning of important and previously sustaining beliefs. This can lead to spiritual
struggle or even loss of faith.” – U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (2012)

The United States is the most religious developed nation in the world, with nearly 90
percent of adults claiming a belief in God, 44 percent attending religious services at least once
per month, and 73 percent asserting a belief in life after death (Smith et al. 2016). Learning to
cope with traumatic life events, including illness and death, is common to the doctrines of the
world’s major religions (Bousso et al. 2010). Doctrinal promises of an afterlife for those who
practice good works, obey religious law, and are faithful to God provide believers with a
psychological framework for coping with adverse health shocks (Pargament and Brant 1998).
By providing public goods, encouraging social capital development, and insuring against
(financial and psychological) risks from health shocks (Iannaccone 1992b; Berman 2000; Gruber
2005; Iyer 2016; Fruehwirth et al. 2016), religion may provide important mental health benefits
to adherents. 1,2 While causal evidence is limited, a handful of studies that have accounted for
the endogeneity of religiosity find evidence that religious participation is associated with

1

Economists have also studied how religiosity is impacted by the level of competition in the market for religion
(Bisin and Verdier 2000; Iannacocone and Berman 2008), including secular forces (Gruber and Hungerman 2008;
Cesur and Mocan 2018; Hungerman 2014; Becker et al. 2017), population diversity (Cesur and Yildirim 2020),
income (Chen, 2010; Buser 2015), and welfare generosity (Hungerman 2005).
2
There is also evidence that religiosity is associated with increased educational attainment and earnings (Gruber
2005), improved physical health (Deaton 2009; Mellor and Freeborn 2011; Fruehwirth et al. 2016), lower crime
rates (Gruber and Hungerman 2008), reduced welfare receipt (Gruber 2005), and greater trust among citizens (Smidt
1999; Daniels and von der Ruhr 2010).

improved mental health of both U.S. adults (Cohen-Zada and Sander 2011) and adolescents
(Fruehwirth et al. 2016). 3
A wide body of research has examined the impacts of adverse health shocks on health
care utilization and the demand for health insurance. 4 In contrast, very little is known about how
negative health shocks affect religiosity. This gap in knowledge is important to fill for a number
of reasons. First, most of the world’s religious doctrines and practices purport to help adherents
cope with health trauma, including mortality (Slater et al. 2016). Moreover, the rise of religious
counseling services as an alternative to professional, secular psychological counseling services
(Besterman-Dahan et al. 2012; Paul and Kelly 2005) has raised some concern among mental
health professionals because the relative psychological benefits of religious as compared to
secular counseling is unclear (Pargament et al. 2013; Koenig 2012; Sloan 2006; Sloan et al.
2000), as is whether their joint use could augment the effectiveness of each (Post et al. 2009).
Finally, those who experience a negative health shock may be in a particularly vulnerable
psychological state as they select among a variety of secular and religious services advertising
important mental health benefits.
Much of public health and social psychology literatures that have studied the relationship
between health-related trauma and religiosity has treated health as exogenous to other
determinants of religiosity (see, for example, Ter Kuile 2014; Mclntosh 2011; Koenig et al.
2012; VanderWeele et al. 2016). This may be problematic to the extent that exposure to
traumatic health events may be non-random. For example, adverse health conditions may be
related to economic circumstances of the household (Fox et al. 2014; Mock et al. 2003), access

3

A recent survey of members of the American Psychological Association found that 82 percent agreed with the
statement, “[B]eing religious is beneficial to mental health” (Park et al. 2017, p. 7).

to quality, affordable medical care (Hadley and Reschovsky 2012; Mays and Smith 2011; Miller
et al. 2019; Orsini 2019) or job characteristics (Gonzalez-Mule and Cockburn 2017), each of
which may also be correlated with religiosity (Guiso et al. 2003; Deaton 2009). 5 Thus, an
important challenge in estimating the causal impact of health-related trauma is isolating
exogenous variation in health events.
This study improves upon the prior literature by using the setting of modern war to
explore the causal impact of combat-induced traumatic health shocks on veterans’ religiosity.
War is a life-and-death struggle that generates substantial health trauma to servicemembers and
their families (Tanielian and Jaycox 2008; Cesur and Sabia 2016). Servicemen deployed to
combat face imminent-threat of physical injury and death (Sabia and Skimmyhorn 2019; Shen et
al. 2009) and may witness or participate in the deaths of enemy combatants, civilians, and
comrades-in-arms (Fontana and Rosenheck 2004; Drescher et al. 2011; Steenkamp et al. 2011).
In part due to these traumatic events, post-9/11 war deployments have been linked to PostTraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), and over 50,000 combatrelated injuries (McKee and Robinson 2014; Zarembo 2014; Cesur et al. 2013; Okie 2005),
estimated to cost over $150 billion in health care costs to the Department of Veterans Affairs
(Sabia and Skimmyhorn 2019). 6

5

To take another example, victims of crime-related health trauma may be targeted because they are financially,
socially, or psychologically vulnerable (Nunziata 2015; Bateson 2012), traits that are difficult to measure and may
be related to religiosity (Schieman 2010; Bjorck and Thurman 2007).
6
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has identified the provision of mental health services to combat veterans
as a top policy priority (Litz and Schlenger 2009; Marx 2009). In January 2018, President Donald Trump issued
Executive Order 13822, which mandated the Secretaries of Homeland Security, Defense, and Veterans Affairs
develop a Joint Action Plan to provide psychological services to combat veterans more effectively.

3

The effect of war-induced health trauma on religiosity is theoretically ambiguous. 7 On
the one hand, fear of death, battlefield injury, and war-related psychological harm may cause
combat veterans to question, or even abandon, religious faith, as life-and-death experiences
challenge religious doctrines of good and evil (Fontana and Rosenheck 2004; Falsetti et al. 2003;
Ogden 2011). In addition, health trauma may cause combat veterans to substitute away from
religion and toward secular counseling or, less healthily, toward risky behaviors, such as illicit
drug use, to numb emotional pain (Cesur et al. 2016; Cesur et al. 2019). Alternatively, the
adverse physical and mental health effects of warfare, including fear of death, could increase
religiosity by increasing the demand for social support networks or doctrinal philosophies that
promise life after death (Bentzen 2019). Moreover, because seeking religious counseling for
mental health problems is perceived to carry less military career risk and less social stigma than
seeking professional psychological counseling services (Morgan et al. 2016; Besterman-Dahan et
al. 2012), combat service could increase religiosity. In addition, war could create tighter bonds
among combat units that generate religious peer effects. Finally, military chaplains stationed in
war zones may affect religiosity by proselytizing in environments where competition from
secular counselors is relatively limited.
This study is the first to study the causal impact of war deployments on religion. We
exploit administrative procedures carried out by senior commanders in the U.S. Armed Forces
that conditionally randomly assign active-duty servicemen to war deployments to estimate the
causal impact of combat service on religious participation, private prayer, and spiritual salience
among servicemen. Our analysis focuses on modern warfare waged in Afghanistan and Iraq in

7

For example, in a mental health production framework (Grossman 1972), life-and-death trauma may affect the
marginal product of religiosity, the marginal rate of technical substitution between religious and other mental healthgenerating inputs (such as secular counseling) and the marginal utility of religiosity.

the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). Using data from the military module of the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent and Adult Health (NLSAAH), we find that servicemen
deployed to combat zones are 7.9 percentage-points more likely to attend religious services
weekly and 8.6 percentage-points more likely to engage in private prayer than their counterparts
assigned to non-combat overseas deployments. Then, using data from the Department of
Defense Survey of Health and Related Behaviors (HRB) Among Active-Duty Personnel, we find
that exposure to enemy firefight during combat deployments substantially increases the
probability of both public and private expressions of religion. The magnitudes of the impacts are
largest for enlisted servicemen as compared to officers, junior servicemen under age 25, and
those physically injured in combat.
Descriptive evidence suggests that the psychological and physical burdens of war
deployments as well as the presence of military chaplains in war zones help to explain combatinduced increases in religiosity. However, we find only weak evidence that combat service
differentially affects the likelihood that veterans seek religious as compared to secular
psychological counseling. We conclude that traumatic health shocks have important impacts on
religiosity.

2. Background
2.1 The Global War on Terrorism
The Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) was launched by the United States in response to
the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and included major combat operations in Afghanistan
and Iraq, chiefly Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF),
respectively. More than 2.5 million U.S. servicemen were deployed in OEF and OIF, with peak
deployments at over 100,000 in Afghanistan and nearly 60,000 in Iraq (Marx 2009; Epstein and
5

Williams 2016). In contrast to prior wars, multiple deployments for longer durations were more
common in both OEF and OIF (Marx 2009). Thirty-seven percent of servicemembers deployed
to Iraq and Afghanistan were deployed on multiple occasions (Litz and Schlenger 2009) and the
duration of combat tours was, on average, 28 percent higher relative to prior conflicts (Baiocchi
2013). As of January 2020, OEF and OIF resulted in 5,390 servicemembers killed in action and
over 52,000 wounded (Defense Manpower Data Centers Defense Casualty Analysis System
2016).
While casualty rates in post-September 11 wars were about 70 percent lower than in
draft-era conflicts —due, in part, to improvements in battlefield medicine, increased use of body
armor, and the rise of unmanned drones — modern warfare also altered the nature of injuries
among those who survived (Sabia and Skimmyhorn 2019). The waging of asymmetric warfare,
characterized by enemies’ use of improvised explosive devices, roadside bombs, and mines
resulted in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) being the distinctive injury of GWOT (McKee and
Robinson 2014; Okie 2005).
War experiences in GWOT also generated substantial “invisible wounds of war,” or
psychological scars, for combat veterans (Tanielian and Jaycox 2008). Such invisible wounds
have taken the form of increased risk of PTSD (Tanielian and Jaycox 2008), suicide ideation
(Cesur et al. 2013), and substance use (McFall et al. 1992; Price et al. 2004). Estimates from
RAND suggest that nearly one-quarter of returning deployed servicemembers suffered from
depressive symptomatology, substance use, homelessness, or PTSD (Tanielian and Jaycox
2008).
The sources of war-related psychological trauma has been studied extensively by both
military health researchers (McFarlane 2010) and health economists (Cesur et al. 2013). Combat

6

experiences such as (i) witnessing deaths and injuries to unit members, coalition members, or
civilians, (ii) engaging the enemy in firefight (including rocket or mortar fire), and (iii) killing
others, are associated with substantially increased levels of trauma (Litz and Schlenger 2009;
Steenkamp et al. 2011), which is often manifest in the form of PTSD (Fontana and Rosenheck
2004; Litz and Schlenger 2009; Cesur et al. 2013; Gubkin 2016). Moreover, there is evidence
that the fear and guilt associated with the threat of trauma, even if they do not materialize, may
generate symptoms of PTSD (Steenkamp et al. 2011; Cesur et al. 2013).
The rise of TBI, PTSD, and physical wounds of war (Polimanti et al. 2017; Ling and
Ecklund 2011; Tanielian and Jaycox 2008), in conjunction with liberalization of eligibility
standards (Angrist et al. 2011; Autor et al. 2016), have driven a nearly threefold increase in
spending on the Veterans Disability Compensation (VDC) program for veterans (U.S.
Congressional Budget Office 2014).

2.2 Theory on Effects of Traumatic Health Shocks on Religion
Both economic and socio-psychological theories inform the expected impact of traumatic
health shocks on religiosity. Adverse health shocks may induce greater religiosity as a response
to the fear of death, injury, or psychological harm in battle. This may come from newly induced
demand for services provided by religious institutions or via "withdrawals" on prior investments
in religious capital (Berman 2000; Chen 2010; Hungerman 2005). Such religious investments
could increase combat veterans' net present discounted utility, which may include the afterlife.
Moreover, the increase in religiosity may be transitory and pass after the imminent threat of
death has receded.

7

The demand for religion may also rise if religiosity aids in the production of mental
health, perhaps dampening the adverse mental health effects of war-related trauma (De Castella
and Simmonds 2013; Harris et al. 2015). 8 This could occur, for example, through the provision
of social support networks (Iannaccone 1992a; Iyer 2016) such as the Knights of Columbus,
informal weekly prayer groups, or counseling sessions with pastoral agents. Moreover, doctrinal
philosophies may provide meaning in the wake of trauma (De Castella and Simmonds 2013),
leading to a strengthening of personal faith. For example, prior work has found that individuals
may turn to religion to cope with unpredictable natural disasters such as earthquakes (Bentzen
2019). Combat veterans may also turn to religion because of the adverse impacts of combat on
family life, including increased risk of divorce (Negrusa, Negrusa, and Hosek 2014) and
domestic violence (Cesur and Sabia 2016).
On the other hand, some psychological theories, including the shattered assumptions
hypothesis, suggests that trauma could reduce religiosity. Adverse health shocks may lead some
to abandon religious faith because it has shattered their notions of how their lives were promised
to unfold (Overcash et al. 1996; De Castella and Simmonds 2013; Ter Kuile and Ehring 2014;
Harris et al. 2015). That is, individuals may turn away from religion because of perceived
doctrinal promises of delivering outcomes that are just (Lyons 1991; McLaughlin 1994; Falsetti
et al. 2003; Fontana and Rosenheck 2004). 9
In addition, the effects of health trauma on religion could differ by dimensions of
religiosity (Glock 1962; Glock and Stark 1965; Koeing et al. 1997). 10,11 For example, if

8

See also Overcash et al. (1996); Shaw et al. (2005); Peres et al. (2007); and Koenig (2009).
Along these lines, Falsetti et al. (2003) argue that combat veterans with wartime trauma may substitute away from
religion and toward secular mental health services to improve their mental health.
10
Glock (1962) and Glock and Stark (1965) classify religiosity into five dimensions: belief, ritual, experience,
knowledge, and consequence.
11
For a detailed overview of the literature, see Koenig et al. (2001). See also Egbert et al. (2004), Bjarnson (2007),
and Berry (2005) for a discussion of several different measures of religiosity.

8

participation in religious services, but not private religious beliefs are affected by life-and-death
shocks, this could suggest that the insurance function of religion may be the primary channel. On
the other hand, if combat trauma impacts the strength of belief, but not religious-based social
interactions, this could suggest that doctrinal philosophies drive increased demand for religion.

2.3 Other Mechanisms
War service could also affect religiosity through channels unrelated to fear of death or
trauma, at least directly. Peer effects have been documented to be quite important among those
serving in the military (Lyle 2007; Carrell et al. 2009; 2011). Those who select into military
service have, at least historically, been more likely to identify with religion than their nonserving counterparts (Burdette et al. 2009). Combat experiences could intensify bonds among
comrades-in-arms and increase the likelihood that religious doctrines spread through peers
(Fontana and Rosenheck 2004). Furthermore, the buildup of spiritual capital in combat may
incentivize the members of the armed forces to seek connections with religious communities
when they transition to civilian life and therefore increase religiosity. Consistent with this
explanation, time away from former peers in servicemembers’ stateside religious communities
could lead to a loosening of religious ties, leading to less engagement upon return. Alternatively,
peer effects may operate in the opposite direction and lead to a reduction in piousness if peers of
servicemembers are composed of less religious individuals.
There may be other “supply-side” channels at work as well, including military chaplain
availability, which advocates claim are indispensable in improving servicemembers’ mental
health and healing invisible wounds of war (Litz et al. 2009; Drescher et al. 2011; Worthington
and Langberg 2012). The Armed Forces Chaplains Board appoints chaplains to each service

9

branch with the charge of tending to the religious, spiritual, and overall personal well-being of
servicemembers and their families. The primary focus of the chaplaincy is “religious ritual,
instruction, and counseling: for example, ‘religious services, rites, sacraments, ordinances, and
religious ministrations,’ as well as religious pastoral care and teaching” (Waggoner 2014, p. 14).
A 2006 Congressional report concluded that there were 2,859 regular duty chaplains and 1,740
reserve chaplains serving as members of the Armed Forces (Jindal 2006). Each chaplain may
have over 1,500 servicemembers entrusted to his care (Johns 2017).
In 2012, there were over 1,400 military chaplains deployed to combat zones. Military
chaplains are employed as staff officers and are considered non-combatants, as they do not
possess the duties and responsibilities of military command and are prohibited from bearing
arms. Their roles include ensuring freedom of religion for servicemembers, facilitating dialog
with civilian organizations on religious issues, and promoting joint military endeavors. 12 While
the Armed Forces Uniform Code of Conduct and the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
prohibit military chaplains from promoting or establishing a religion, military chaplains are
encouraged to form close relationships with servicemembers and to provide psychological
support as needed. 13 There is evidence that servicemembers may be more likely to approach
chaplains than secular mental health counselors to treat the psychological impacts of war because
there is less social stigma attached to such services (Besterman-Dahan et al. 2012).
Despite prohibitions against proselytizing, the presence of chaplains could encourage
such behaviors (Astore 2010), including among soldiers with prior religious exposure, which

Historically, the military chaplaincy has been viewed as a strategic asset that aids in the successful prosecution of
military operations (Waggoner 2012).

10

could increase religious adherence. 14 Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that religion has
been employed as an ingroup coordination tool during intergroup violence (Kurzban and
Christner 2011; MacNeill 2004; Johnson and Reeve 2013). As such, religion may aid success in
war by promoting within-group cohesion, self-sacrifice, and heroism, as well as justifying killing
(Reeve 2013).

2.4 Existing Literature on War and Religiosity
The literature on the relationship between war service and religiosity is thin and mostly
descriptive. 15 One set of studies describes the characteristics of those who select into the allvolunteer U.S. Armed Forces. 16 While military personnel are more religious, on the whole, than
the civilian population (Burdette et al. 2009), it is unclear whether this association is causal given
the self-selection of military personnel into the U.S. Armed Forces. 17
Descriptive evidence suggests that servicemembers with mental health problems
frequently turn to clergy (often military chaplains) for mental health services. Besterman-Dahan
et al. (2012) find that nearly one-third of active-duty servicemembers utilize mental health
services offered by military chaplains compared to 44 percent who seek support from nonreligious healthcare professionals. Along the same lines, Kopacz et al. (2017) find that about
one-third of suicide attempt survivors received chaplaincy services in the 30 days following their

14

This issue is of some concern to civil libertarians, who worry that government-sanctioned zealous proselytizing
could violate the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. Supporters of chaplains argue that they are
indispensable to servicemembers' mental health and the achievement of military objectives.
15
While the causal evidence on the link between war service and piousness is sparse, Henrich et al. (2019) find that
exposure to war increases the religious participation of Christian and Muslim civilians using data on 1,709
individuals in Uganda, Sierra Leone and Tajikistan. The authors attribute these findings to religion’s ability to foster
cooperation in intergroup conflict. In return, the associated increases in religious adherence generate a feedback loop
that promotes subsequent religiosity.

suicide attempt. Moreover, there is evidence that those who seek out chaplain services are often
most in need of psychological services (Morgan et al. 2016).
Several other studies have explored the relationship between symptoms of war trauma
and religiosity, with mixed findings. 18 A study of 120 Bosnian-Herzegovinian veterans of the
Bosnian war finds that PTSD is negatively related to religiosity (Hasanović and Pajević 2015).
On the other hand, Tran et al. (2012) evaluated a sample of 449 U.S. veterans from veterans
Administration (VA) hospitals who had experienced military-related health trauma and sought
mental health treatment. The authors find that veterans who turned to religion for “socially
motivated reasons” were less likely to suffer severe symptoms of PTSD or depressive
symptomatology. They conclude that “evaluating religiosity in patients may be an important area
to address in PTSD and depression treatment” (Tran et al. 2012, p. 313).
Finally, Harris et al. (2011) examine a small sample (54) of veterans who had suffered
from psychological trauma. They estimate the impact of a group intervention therapy designed
to utilize veterans' pre-existing religious beliefs to improve the management of combat-related
trauma and find that religiosity mitigates the adverse psychological consequences of war.

3. Data and Measures

Our analysis uses data drawn from two national datasets, which include data on military
servicemen, their combat assignments, and religiosity.

3.1 The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (NLSAAH)

18

See also Chen and Koenig (2006) for a review of the broader literature on trauma, including exposure to domestic
violence, and religiosity.

12

The NLSAAH is a nationally representative longitudinal survey that began by collecting
information on high school students in the 1994-1995 academic year. Three follow-up surveys
were conducted and the last to date, collected in 2007-2008, contains information on respondents
ages 24 to 34. These data are useful for our purposes because, at Wave IV, the NLSAAH
includes a military module with a broad set of military characteristics and war experiences from
current active-duty personnel and prior service veterans. Servicemembers' war experiences
mainly include post-9/11 GWOT deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.
Our NLSAAH analysis sample focuses on 482 active-duty overseas-deployed servicemen
who, at the time of the Wave IV survey, provided information on their current religiosity, and
reported that their military service began after the Wave I survey interview. 19 Among these 482
deployed servicemen, 298 (59.3 percent) completed their military service before the Wave IV
survey interview, while 196 (40.7 percent) were currently serving in the military.
Our primary measure of combat, Combat Assignment, is a dichotomous variable
generated from self-reports of combat deployments. 20 Combat Assignment is set equal to 1 if the
respondent reported being deployed overseas to a combat zone and set equal to 0 for
deployments to non-combat zones.
We also exploit additional information collected in the NLSAAH military module to
capture war theatre experiences among those deployed to combat zones. We generate the
variable Enemy Engagement, set equal to 1 if the respondent reported ‘‘engaging the enemy in

19
Because the NLSAAH does not provide information on the age of high school completion, we exclude survey
respondents for whom the start of military service precedes the Wave I interview. Including these 13 individuals in
the analysis does not affect our estimates.
20

This variable is constructed using the following survey questions in the Wave IV of NLSAAH.
“Was your military service in the US, outside the US, or both?”
“What is the total amount of time you (have) served in a combat zone?”

13

firefight” while in a combat zone and set equal to 0 otherwise. 21 This allows us to estimate the
independent effect of combat exposure.
We generate three measures of religiosity at the time of the Wave IV interview to capture
both public and private expression of religion. First, respondents are asked:
"How often have you attended church, synagogue, temple, mosque, or religious services
in the past 12 months?"
We generate a dichotomous variable, Weekly Religious Attendance, set equal to 1 if the
respondent reported attending his place of worship or religious services at least once per week in
the last year, and set equal to 0 otherwise. 22 In addition, servicemen are asked:
“How often do you pray privately, that is, when you're alone, in places other than a
church, synagogue, temple, mosque, or religious assembly?”
The variable Prayer is coded as 1 if the respondent reports praying outside of a religious service
and 0 otherwise. Finally, respondents are asked:
“How important (if at all) is your religious faith to you?”
Religious Importance is set equal to 1 if the respondent reported that his faith was “very
important” or “more important than anything else,” and set equal to 0 otherwise.
A key advantage of the NLSAAH data is its inclusion of information on a wide set of
military characteristics (e.g., military rank, the branch of service, the timing of military service,
occupation), which is vital for the "conditional random assignment" identification strategy

21

The following questionnaire item from the Wave IV NLSAAH is used to construct Enemy Engagement.
“During your combat deployment, how many times did you engage the enemy in a firefight?”

22

We also experimented with alternative measures of frequency of church attendance, including whether the
respondent had ever attended religious services to gauge the extensive margin of behavior. The results from this
definition of religious service attendance appear in Appendix Table 1.

14

described in Section 4 below. 23 Moreover, because the data are longitudinal in nature, we are
able to test the robustness of findings to controls for pre-enlistment religiosity.
Despite these important advantages, the NLSAAH data set also has some shortcomings.
Small sample sizes limit both the power of our research design and our ability to examine
heterogeneous impacts of combat, such as by branch of service or specific combat experiences.

3.2 Department of Defense (DOD) Health and Related Behaviors (HRB) Survey, 2008
To compensate for limitations with the NLSAAH data, we next turn to the HRB survey.
Administered by RTI International, the HRB survey collects information on the health and wellbeing of active-duty military personnel, measured at nearly the same time as Wave IV of the
NLSAAH. The survey is designed to be representative of active-duty servicemembers across all
branches and pay grades of the U.S. Armed Forces. Individuals who were absent without official
leave (AWOL), incarcerated at the time of data collection, or attending a service academy were
excluded from the interview.
Our analysis sample is comprised of 11,598 active-duty servicemen between the ages of
18 and 50 who were deployed overseas and provided non-missing information on religiosity.
Included are 2,563 soldiers, 2,563 marines, 3,374 sailors, and 3,098 airmen. While the HRB
survey does not contain information on lifetime combat and non-combat zone deployments that
would allow us to construct a measure analogous to Combat Service, we can use the information
available in the survey to construct an analogous measure of Enemy Engagement. Respondents
were asked:

23

In fact, the NLSAAH contains information on the military observables available to Human Resources Command
when making unit assignments.

15

“Thinking about all of your deployments, [have you] or members of [your] unit, received
incoming fire from small arms, artillery, rockets, or mortars…or [has your] unit fired on
the enemy?”
Enemy Engagement is set equal to 1 for those who reported exposure to enemy firefight while
they were deployed, either through incoming fire or firing on the enemy, and 0 otherwise.
To capture the intensity of war experiences that may explain the potential mechanisms
between combat and religion in the HRB survey, we take advantage of more specific measures of
combat experiences, which can help explain the mechanisms through which combat exposure
affects religiosity. These measures include Combat Injury and Witness Death, dichotomous
variables that capture whether the respondent was injured in combat and witnessed deaths in war,
respectively. 24
Outcomes in the HRB survey are measured analogously to the NLSAAH military
module. Religious attendance is measured using responses to the following survey item:
“During the past 12 months, how many times did you attend religious/spiritual services?
(Please do not include special occasions, such as weddings, christenings, funerals, or
other special events in your answer.)”
Frequent Religious Attendance is set equal to 1 if the respondent attends services 25 or more
weeks per year and is set equal to 0 otherwise. 25

24

These measures were generated using servicemen’s responses to the following questionnaire items:
“Thinking about all of your deployments, how many times have you had each of the following experiences?
I was wounded in combat.”
“Thinking about all of your deployments, how many times have you had each of the following experiences?
I saw dead bodies or human remains.”

25

Responses to this survey item do not allow us to distinguish between biweekly and weekly church attendance as
each is contained in the same category of possible responses. Therefore, our measure of religious attendance in the
HRB survey is slightly different than in the NLSAAH. Analyses using alternate measures of religious service

16

While the HRB data does not ask whether the respondents pray on their own in an
identical fashion to the NLSAAH, it asks the following survey question to measure if the
respondents pray under stressful circumstances:
“When you feel pressured, stressed, depressed, or anxious, how often do you engage in
each of the following activities: Say a prayer”
Prayer is set equal to 1 for those who frequently pray when they are stressed, depressed
or anxious and 0 if they do so only sometimes, rarely or never. Finally, servicemen were asked
to agree or disagree along a Likert scale with the following statement:
“My religious/spiritual beliefs are a very important part of my life.”
We generate an indicator, Religious Importance, set equal to 1 if the respondent agrees or
strongly agrees that religious beliefs are a very important part of his life and 0 otherwise.
As is the case with the NLSAAH data, the HRB data has strengths and weaknesses. The
relatively larger sample allows us to more precisely estimate branch-specific effects of combat.
In addition, because the HRB survey is a representative sample of the active-duty military
personnel, the estimates obtained from the sample are more generalizable to all active duty
service members, including those older and younger than surveyed in the NLSAAH. On the
other hand, if previous combat exposure influences the likelihood of remaining in the military,
estimates using only those who are currently on active duty may suffer from sample selection
bias. An additional limitation of the HRB data is the lack of information on religious
denomination affiliation either before or after deployment; thus, we cannot conduct
heterogeneity analysis by religious sect. Finally, due to confidentiality requirements, the HRB

attendance, including ever attending services or attending services more than weekly, produced a qualitatively
similar pattern of results.

17

survey lacks data on some important military observables (such as primary military occupation),
though it does include other reasonable proxies, which we discuss below. 26

4. Identification
4.1 Natural Experiment
An extensive body of literature estimating the impact of military service on labor market
outcomes (Angrist 1990; 1998; Angrist et al. 2011; Angrist and Chen 2011) or other measures of
socioeconomic wellbeing (Angrist et al. 2010; Angrist and Johnson 2000; Price et al. 2004;
McFall et al. 1992a,b; Rohlfs 2010; Lindo and Stoecker 2014) has relied on the draft lottery as a
natural experiment to identify the causal impact of war. The absence of conscription in the U.S.
following the abolition of the draft in 1973 makes such an identification strategy impossible for
service during GWOT. Instead, we rely on an alternate natural experiment that identifies a very
different local average treatment effect. We explot the administrative procedures by which U.S.
Armed Forces Human Resources Command (HRC) assigns active-duty servicemen to
deployment duties to generate variation in combat assignment that is plausibly exogenous to
religiosity.
First, senior commanders rarely issue deployment orders to individual servicemembers
independent of the branch-specific units in which they serve (Lyle 2006; Engel et al. 2010).
Senior commanders assign individuals servicemen to their units (i.e., battalion) and then issue
deployment orders to these units. For the purposes of these assignments, HRC treats branch-

26

These covariates include the branch of service, rank, the timing of service, detailed measures of educational
attainment, and installation level Major Command (MAJCOM), a subdivision for a particular military installation
responsible for a specific combat/support mission. MAJCOMs include U.S. Army Training and Doctrine
Command, U.S. Army Europe, U.S. Army Pacific, 8th Army, U.S. Fleet Forces Command, Commander Pacific
Forces, Naval Medical Command, Commander Naval Installations Command, Marine Corps Installations East,
Marine Corps Installations West, Air Combat Command, Air Education and Training Command, Air Force Materiel
Command, Air Force Space Command, Air Mobility Command, Pacific Air Forces, and U.S. Air Forces Europe.

18

specific servicemen of identical military rank and primary military occupation specialty as
perfect substitutes. 27 As a rule, senior commanders do not consider personal preferences,
religious practices, or family background in assigning servicemen to units or deploying units
overseas (Engel et al. 2010). We know of no evidence that senior commanders issue deployment
orders to military units based on non-military characteristics of its members (Carter and
Skimmyhorn 2017; Sabia and Skimmyhorn 2019).
Senior commanders decide when, where, and for how long to deploy units based largely
on exogenous factors, such as (i) the state of operational environment, which is dictated by world
events, and (ii) the readiness and availability of suitable units, determined by equipment
availability, timing of training completion, and the occupational composition of unit members
(Army Regulation 220-1; Lyle 2006; Engel et al. 2010). Thus, the administrative procedures of
senior commanders mimic conditional random assignment of active-duty deployed servicemen to
overseas deployment duties. That is, conditional on military rank, year of enlistment, and
occupation (within service branch), deployment assignments among active-duty personnel are
exogenous to veteran religiosity. 28
The main threats to identification in this conditional random assignment framework are
(i) stay-back selection, whereby some members of a unit may be non-randomly selected to
remain at the stateside military base, and (ii) non-deployability of some servicemembers due to
health conditions. With regard to stay-back selection, Sabia and Skimmyhorn (2019) note that
less than 5 percent of active-duty soldiers stay back. Moreover, in studies of the health and

27
Lyle (2006) and Engel et al. (2010) test for so-called “stayback selection" bias by using unit-level deployment
orders as an instrumental variable (IV) for individual deployment. A comparison of IV and ordinary least squares
(OLS) estimates suggest that potential stay-back selection is an unimportant source of bias.
28
While a servicemember can affect the likelihood he is assigned a combat deployment by his choice of occupation
specialty, year of enlistment, and tenure in the military (rank), conditional on these military characteristics,
deployment assignments are orthogonal to other determinants of veteran religiosity.

19

socioeconomic effects of post-September 11 combat service, instrumental variables (IV)
estimates that rely on unit-level deployment orders as an instrument for individual deployment
produce estimates that are very similar to OLS estimates that treat individual deployment as
conditionally randomly assigned (Lyle 2006; Sabia and Skimmyborn 2019). Conditional random
assignment of active-duty personnel to overseas deployments has been exploited by previous
scholars examining the impacts of deployments on servicemembers’ children (Lyle 2006; Engel
et al. 2010), servicemen’s risk of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (Cesur et al. 2013), as well as
domestic violence (Cesur and Sabia 2016).
Data from the NLSAAH are particularly valuable for carrying out this natural experiment
because they include information on the military observables available to HRC when making
deployment decisions. Therefore, we are able to provide descriptive tests of whether, conditional
on these observables, deployment assignment is orthogonal to an extensive set of personal and
family background characteristics, including pre-enlistment religiosity. While the HRB data do
not include information on military occupation, there is prior evidence that these missing data do
not contaminate the natural experiment described above in the presence of controls for the
branch of service, military rank, the timing of service, educational attainment, and installationlevel Major Command (Cesur and Sabia 2016). We explore similar tests below.

4.2 Estimating Equations
We begin with data on active-duty overseas-deployed servicemen from the NLSAAH and
estimate the following estimating equation to test whether combat assignment is related to preenlistment observables after controlling for military observables available to HRC:
Combat Assignmenti = β0 + β1Mi + β2Xi + ei

20

(1)

where Combat Assignmenti measures whether serviceman i was deployed to a combat or noncombat zone, Mi is a vector of military controls for serviceman i, including military rank, branch
of service, timing of service, and occupation, and Xi is set of covariates capturing pre-enlistment
(Wave I) individual- and family-level characteristics: age, race, cognitive ability, height, weight,
parental income, parental marital status, parental religiosity, as well as the respondent’s own preenlistment religiosity. Also included in the vector Xi are controls for the respondent's maternal
educational attainment and own educational attainment. If, conditional on Mi, combat
assignment should be orthogonal to individual and family background characteristics, we
hypothesize that the estimate of β2 should be 0.
Next, we estimate the impact of combat assignment on religiosity in equation (2):
Ri = γ0 + γ1Combat Assignmenti + γ2Mi + εi

(2)

where Ri measures the religiosity of serviceman i. In alternate specifications, we add Enemy
Engagementi as an additional right-hand-side variable to isolate the effects of combat exposure
and combat zone assignment without exposure. If the assumptions underlying the natural
experiment described above hold, then γ1 will be an unbiased estimate of the impact of combat
zone assignment on religiosity. As another descriptive test of this assumption, we add the vector
Xi to the right-hand side of equation (2):
Ri = γ0 + γ1Combat Assignmenti + γ2Mi + γ3Xi + εi

(3)

If the estimate of γ1 remains unchanged in equations (2) and (3), this is evidence consistent with
the hypothesis that Combat Assignment is orthogonal to religiosity.
A similar estimating equation is used for the HRB survey:
Ri = θ0 + θ1Enemy Engagementi + θ2Mi + θ3Xi + µi

21

(4)

where Enemy Engagement indicates if respondent i was deployed to a combat zone with an
enemy firefight, Mi includes a set of military variables available in the HRB survey, including
military rank, the branch of service, Major Command (MAJCOM), and frequency of
deployments. Additionally, the vector Xi includes controls for age, race, marital status, and
educational attainment, which are present in all models. While we do not have specific controls
for military occupation in the HRB survey, the set of controls available in the DOD data appear
to be sufficient to not contaminate the natural experiment described above. 29 Finally, we note
that the effects of war obtained from equation (4) may be biased downward to the extent that
some who are not exposed to enemy engagement, but are assigned to combat zones may have
their religiosity affected by their deployment assignment.

5. Results
5.1 NLSAAH Results
Descriptive statistics for the NLSAAH in Table 1 show that 15.4 percent of active-duty
deployed servicemen attend religious services weekly. Approximately three-quarters (75.1
percent) report praying outside of their house of worship and just over half (51.1 percent) report
that religion is an important aspect of their lives. Concerning deployment assignments, twothirds (76 percent) of servicemen were assigned to combat zones, and 37 percent reported
engaging the enemy in a firefight.

29
To descriptively test the validity of this assumption, we estimated the effect of combat on our outcomes in the
NLSAAH sample (where the natural experiment is “clean”) by only controlling for the covariates that are available
in the DOD data. As shown in Appendix Table 2, results obtained from this exercise are very similar to the clean
natural experiment from the NLSAAH sample. These findings lend support to the hypothesis that estimates from the
DOD data are unbiased.

22

In Table 2, we present estimates from equation (1) to test if predetermined covariates in
the vector Xi predict combat assignment. 30 Specifically, we examine whether deployment
assignment is related to own pre-deployment religiosity, height and weight, age and race,
educational attainment, cognitive ability, and parental household income, marital status,
educational attainment, and religiousness. 31 Our results show little evidence that these
characteristics predict whether servicemen are deployed to combat zones as compared to noncombat zones (column 1), to combat zones with enemy firefight as compared to combat zones
without enemy firefight (column 2), or to combat zones with enemy firefight versus non-combat
zones (column 3). Out of 78 coefficients estimated, only three are statistically distinguishable
from zero at conventional levels, and no single category of related variables (e.g., income) is
jointly statistically different from zero. This descriptive balancing test supports the assumption
that deployment assignment is orthogonal to religiosity.
Table 3 shows estimates of γ1 from equation (2). In Panel I, we find that servicemen
assigned to combat zones are 7.9 percentage-points more likely to attend weekly religious
services in the past year than their counterparts deployed to non-combat zones (Panel I, column
1). Those assigned to combat are also 8.6 percentage-points more likely to engage in private
prayer (Panel I, column 2), and 4.5 percentage-points more likely to report religion is important
to them (Panel I, column 3), though this latter estimate is not statistically different from zero at
conventional levels. These estimates, which are economically substantial (relative to their

30

While we estimate equations (1) through (4) via linear probability models, marginal effects obtained from probit
specifications are very similar to the results presented below.
31
Each (set of) coefficient(s) is(are) obtained from a separate regression; p-values pertain to the joint significance of
mutually exclusive categories providing information on pre-existing characteristics, such as race, income, and
maternal schooling. We also estimate regression models, including all of these right-hand side variables in a single
model. The results from this specification are similar to those presented in Table 2. For example, in column (1), a
test of the joint significance of the variables in the vector X yields an F-statistic of 0.97 and a p-value of 0.52.

23

means), are consistent with the hypothesis that life-and-death shocks induce increases in both
public religious expression as well as private religious practices.
In Panels II and III of Table 3, we explore whether the effects differ by whether the
combat serviceman had separated from the military at the time of the Wave IV survey. We find
that the impact of combat assignment on religious attendance and private prayer is statistically
equivalent for those whose active-duty service was ongoing at the time of the Wave IV survey
(Panel II) and those who had separated from the military (Panel III). This could suggest that the
impact of combat on religious practices persists over time. Interestingly, however, the impact of
combat on self-reported religious salience (column 3) is much larger for those whose service is
current as compared to veterans who had previously separated from the U.S. Armed Forces. This
finding could suggest that combat generates transitory increases in the importance of religion in
one’s life but that this salience dissipates as faith serves its purpose in helping servicemen to
cope with immediate trauma. However, these findings could be explained by heterogeneity in
soldier characteristics or the nature of combat across periods. 32
In the final two panels of Table 3, we examine whether religiosity effects of combat
differ across pre-enlistment religious affiliation. In Panel IV, we restrict the sample to those who
reported a Christian affiliation (e.g., Catholics, Protestants, and Other Christians) at the time of

32

For example, those serving in the armed forces at the time of the Wave IV survey are younger than those who had
separated from the military. Younger individuals may have fewer alternative means to cope with life-threatening
stress, be more susceptible to proselytizing, or be more likely to be impacted by peers. Moreover, the observed
differential impact could represent a cohort effect, whereby current active-duty servicemen may have been involved
in more recent intense combat during the time of the so-called surge in Iraq in 2007 during which more than 20,000
additional servicemembers were deployed to Baghdad and Al Anbar Province. However, it is important to note that
whatever the source of the differential impact of combat assignment on the importance with which servicemen place
on religion, this difference does not translate into religious behavior differences. Combat veterans who have
separated are also more likely to attend religious services regularly and pray than their non-combat veteran
counterparts. We also explore whether the religious effects differ by the prior religiosity of servicemen, which we
have documented is orthogonal to deployment assignment. The results show that combat has the largest impact on
weekly religious service attendance for those who reported some degree of religiosity prior to deployment.

24

the Wave I interview, while Panel V examines all other affiliations or a non-affiliation. We find
that our results in Panel II are driven by the effect of combat on those with a Christian affiliation
before deployment. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that those with Christian
affiliations had accumulated greater religious capital investments at the time enlistment, and
hence were more likely to draw on this religious capital as a coping mechanism in response to
traumatic health shocks. 33 Alternatively, this result is also consistent with the majority of
military chaplains being drawn from Christian denominations (Dao 2011). 34
Next, in Table 4, we explore whether combat exposure, measured by engaging the enemy
in a firefight, has an independent effect on religiosity. We find that servicemen deployed to
combat zones where they engaged the enemy in a firefight were significantly more likely to
attend religious services and engage in private prayer than those deployed to non-combat zones.
However, the magnitude of this effect was not significantly different from the estimated effect of
combat deployments without such exposure. This result could suggest that fear of combat
exposure, and whether or not enemy engagement materializes, may have significant effects on
religiosity. This result is also consistent with a supply-side mechanism such as combat zonespecific, unit-level peer effects in religiosity or increased presence of military chaplains in
combat zones. In the HRB data below, we empirically explore channels that might be at work.
Finally, in Table 5, we examine the sensitivity of estimates to the addition of controls for
individual and personal background characteristics (columns 2, 5, 8), and pre-deployment
religiosity (columns 3, 6, 9), following equation (3). The stability of estimates of γ1 are

33

Consistent with this view, our unreported cross tabulations show that Christian service members exhibited a
higher degree of religious participation prior to enlistment.
34
See, for example: https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/us/27atheists.html

25

consistent with findings of Table 2 and suggest that deployment assignment is conditionally
exogenous to religiosity.

5.2 HRB Results
Given the above-discussed limitations with the NLSAAH survey, we next turn to the
HRB sample. Descriptive statistics, shown in Table 6A, reflect that 18.9 percent of active-duty
members of the armed forces in our sample reported frequent religious attendance in the prior
year, 22.0 percent reported that they turned to prayer in stressful situations, and approximately
two-thirds (69.5 percent) indicated that religion was important to them.
In Table 6B, we show descriptive tests of the exogeneity of deployment assignment in the
HRB sample. Given that the HRB data do not include information on occupation specialty, as is
available in the NLSAAH, we first ensure that there is common support on the detailed military
characteristics that are provided (i.e., branch of service, rank, timing of service, enlisted versus
officer, and Major Command), as well as sociodemographic characteristics. We find no
evidence that the likelihood of an overseas combat deployment is related to sociodemographic
characteristics available in the HRB survey, including age, race/ethnicity, marital status, and
educational attainment.
Table 7 presents the results from equation (4). In Panel I, we find that engaging the
enemy in firefight is associated with a 1.9 percentage-point increase in the probability of
frequent religious attendance (column 1), a 1.4 percentage-point increase in the likelihood of
prayer at times of stress or depression (column 2), and a 1.9 percentage-point increase in the
probability that a serviceman reports that religion is important (column 3). The magnitudes of
these estimates are smaller than those obtained from the NLSAAH, which may be explained, in

26

part, by an increase in religiosity for those deployed to combat zones who are not exposed to
enemy firefight (see Table 4). 35
In Panel II, we explore the sensitivity of OLS estimates in Panel I (which do not include
occupation controls) to requiring common support on the military characteristics available in the
DOD data, including Major Command, a measure not available in the NLSAAH. Using a
nearest neighbor matching estimator, we produce estimates that are quite similar to those shown
in Panel I, albeit less precisely estimated. 36 This adds to our confidence that the religion effects
of combat are unbiased.
In Panels III through VI, we examine heterogeneous impacts of combat exposure by
branch of service. In the main, we find that the effect of combat on religiosity is generally larger
for soldiers, marines, and sailors as compared to airmen. This finding is consistent with evidence
that the psychological costs of combat are largest for those in the Army and Marines, for whom
the nature of combat is quite different as compared to the Air Force (Cesur et al. 2013).
However, we do find that combat exposure is associated with a 2.4 percentage-point increase in
the probability that airmen turn to prayer in stressful situations.
Next, we attempt to disentangle the effects of combat exposure from the effects of time
spent deployed. In Table 8, we use data from the HRB survey on the number of post-9/11
combat deployments and average deployment length and add constructed measures of these
variables to the right-hand side of equation (4). The results in Table 8 suggest that length of
deployments and number of deployments are negatively related to weekly religious attendance

35
Recall that those deployed to non-combat zones without enemy engagement are included in the 0s when Enemy
Engagement is defined in the HRB survey.
36
We employ a nearest neighbor matching with non-replacement. In the common support sample, the estimated
propensity scores between enemy engagement and non-enemy engagement samples must be within 0.001 to
generate a match.

27

(Panel I), which may be due to reduced opportunities to attend religious services while deployed
overseas. However, in our fully specified model (column 4), we confirm that, conditional on
number and length of combat deployments, combat exposure leads to substantial increases in
religiosity, suggesting that life-and-death trauma rather than simply length of possible exposure
to such trauma is important. This pattern of results on the impact of combat exposure persists for
private religious prayer (Panel II) and religious salience (Panel III).

5.3 Heterogeneous Impacts of Combat
Next, we examine whether the effects of combat differ across enlisted servicemen and
officers. Our results in the first two panels of Table 9 show that religious effects are
concentrated among enlisted servicemen. We find that for enlisted servicemen (Panel I), enemy
engagement is associated with a 2 to 3 percentage-point increase in public and private
expressions of religiosity. However, for officers (Panel II) there is no such impact. This result is
consistent with prior evidence showing that the adverse psychological impacts of war, including
effects on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, are larger for enlisted servicemen as compared to
officers (Lyle 2006; Engel et al. 2010; Cesur and Sabia 2016). This finding may also be due to
differences across enlisted servicemen and officers in social support networks, socioeconomic
well-being, and occupation role.
In Panels III through V of Table 9, we explore heterogeneity in the effects of war by age.
Again, consistent with prior work on the adverse psychological effects of war (Cesur and Sabia
2016), we find that the largest religiosity effects of combat are observed for young servicemen
under the age of 25. Estimated religiosity effects of combat for younger servicemen are around 6
percentage-points, while estimates are smaller for those ages 25 to 34, a comparably aged sample

28

as that examined in the NLSAAH, and smaller still for those ages 35 to 55. Thus, junior enlisted
servicemen are differentially impacted relative to junior or senior NCOs. However, an alternative
explanation for the variation in age-specific estimates may be due to survivor bias. As such, if
those who are more resilient to combat are more likely to remain in active service and vice versa,
estimates of the impact of combat on a variety of outcomes as well as religiosity may be lower
among older servicemembers.
Next, in Panel VI of Table 9, we explore whether religious effects of combat extend to
women. At the time of the 2008 HRB Survey, women were prevented from serving in many
front-line combat roles, a regulation changed by the Department of Defense in 2013 (Burelli
2013; Kamarck 2015). However, during this period, women could still be exposed to combat via
enemy fire on military bases overseas, the ambush of their units, and witnessing war casualties
experienced by their comrades. The results in Panel VI show that combat has comparably sized
religiosity effects for women, though these effects are imprecisely estimated.
In the final two panels of Table 9 (Panels VII and VIII), we examine the impact of
particular combat experiences: whether the serviceman was wounded in combat (Panel VII) or
witnessed deaths in battle (VIII). Our findings suggest that being wounded in combat has the
largest positive impact on religiosity. Injury in war is associated with a 7.9 percentage-point
increase in weekly religious service attendance, and a 5.4 percentage-point increase in the
probability of turning to prayer in stressful situations, effect sizes that are substantially larger
than the average impact of enemy engagement. We find less evidence, at least in the HRB
survey, that witnessing deaths or injuries of others impacts religiosity. These findings suggest
that personal physical trauma and the consequences that flow from such trauma may be a
particularly important reason why servicemen turn to religiosity.

29

5.4 Mechanisms and Secular vs Religious Counseling
The results presented above provide consistent evidence that combat service increases
religiosity, particularly when such combat results in physical injuries. In the remaining tables,
we empirically explore the mechanisms through which this increase in religiosity may occur.
One channel may be coping with psychological trauma (Bentzen 2019). The adverse mental
effects of military deployments have been well-documented (Taneilian and Jaycox 2008; Cesur
et al. 2013). In Appendix Table 4, we also confirm that assignment to combat zones with enemy
firefight is associated with substantial increases in the risk of PTSD (column 1), suicide ideation
(column 2), psychological distress (column 3), and being wounded in combat (column 4).
In addition to mental and physical health channels, supply-side mechanisms related to
peers and chaplains may also be important. While we are unable to link supply-side shocks to
the number of chaplains stationed in combat zones to the location and timing of deployments, we
are able to measure the extent to which servicemen turned to military chaplains to treat the
mental health effects of combat, though such visits may certainly be due to demand-side reasons.
In Table 10, we estimate the impact of combat on the probability of seeking counseling
services from secular and religious sources, including military chaplains (Panel I). 37 We find

37

Respondents to the DOD HRB Survey are asked:
“In the past 12 months, did you receive counseling or therapy for mental health or substance abuse from
the following?
•
•
•
•
•
•

Military chaplain
Civilian pastor, rabbi, or other pastoral counselor
Mental health professional at a military facility (e.g., psychologist, psychiatrist, clinical social worker
or other mental health counselor).
General medical doctor at a military facility
General medical doctor at a civilian facility
Civilian mental health professional (e.g., psychologist, psychiatrist, clinical social worker or other
mental health counselor)”

30

that combat exposure is associated with a 7.2 percentage-point increase in the likelihood of
receipt of some type of counseling services (column 1), including from secular sources (e.g.,
medical or psychological professionals) (column 2), civilian clergy (column 3), and military
chaplains (column 4). We fail to detect evidence that combat service increases use of military
chaplains to a greater degree than secular sources.
Finally, in Panel II of Table 10, we find some evidence that, among those who seek out
any type of counseling, servicemen are more likely to turn to civilian clergy than secular
counseling, consistent with the hypothesis that there may be less social stigma associated with
religious-based counseling. 38 However, caution should be taken in interpreting these estimates
given that those who select into counseling are a select sample of servicemen.
Having established that combat generates adverse health effects, as well as increases the
use of psychological counseling services, we descriptively explore the importance of these
channels in explaining the impact of combat on religiosity. In odd-numbered columns on Table
11, we show baseline estimates from equation (4), while in even-numbered columns we add
endogenous measures of psychological well-being, wounding in battle, and (unconditional) use
of chaplain services (unconditionally) to the right-hand side of the estimating equation. Note that
these channels may not be independent of one another. For example, the adverse physical health
effects of war could affect psychological health, which could, in turn, affect the likelihood of
visiting a chaplain. 39 The results of our descriptive mediating exercise show that the physical and
psychological consequences of war, as well as use of chaplain counseling, may explain up to 40
percent of the impact of war on religiosity. These channels appear more important in explaining

38

Results from a multinomial logit model, shown in Appendix Table 3, show a qualitatively similar pattern of
results. However, given that categories of counseling are not independent, the IIA assumption is unlikely to be met.
39
Also, because chaplain use is endogenous, it may be that their use is positively related to religiosity due to
religious individuals being more likely to use chaplain services.

religious attendance and prayer than religious salience. Our results also suggest that residual
unmeasured mechanisms such as coping with the fear of death and unit-level peer influence may
be important in understanding the religious effects of war deployments.

6. Conclusions
Despite a wide body of literature in health economics on the impact of negative health
shocks on health care utilization, very little is known about how traumatic health shocks affect
religiosity. Given that the major religions of the world promote doctrines and practices designed
to help adherents cope with traumatic life shocks — including illness and mortality — this
remains an important gap to be filled, particularly given uncertainty over the relative benefits of
secular and religious counseling.
This study is the first to estimate the impact of post-9/11 war deployments, which
generated substantial physical and psychological trauma for servicemembers, on veterans’
religiosity. We exploit the administrative procedures by which senior commanders in the U.S.
Armed Forces conditionally randomly assign active-duty servicemen to their deployment duties
to isolate the impact of combat deployments religiosity.
Across two national datasets, the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult
Health and the Department of Defense Health and Related Behaviors Survey Among ActiveDuty Personnel, we find that post-9/11 combat service is associated with substantial increases in
religious attendance and prayer. The strongest and largest religious effects of combat exposure
are found among younger enlisted servicemen and those who are physically injured in combat.
We find that these effects may not be transitory, appearing to persist following separation from
the military. Our findings are consistent with religion both playing a “social insurance” role (i.e.,

32

increased frequency of church attendance) as well as serving as an individual-level psychological
coping device (i.e., increased prayer and importance of religion).
Together, our findings suggest that combat-induced health trauma has important effects
on spiritual capital development. We hypothesize several mechanisms at work, including (i)
servicemen seeking out religious organizations and spiritual doctrines to cope with fear of death,
adverse psychological effects of war, or physical wounding in war, (ii) peer effects forged by
bonds created among religious combat veterans, and/or (iii) the role the U.S. military, wittingly
or unwittingly, plays in nudging servicemen toward religiosity via chaplains or social stigma for
seeking out secular psychological services. Finally, we find only weak evidence that combat
assignment differentially affects the demand for religious as compared to secular psychological
services.
We concede that an important limitation of our study is that the religious impacts of
combat-related health trauma may not generalize to health trauma experienced by civilians. For
instance, the religious effect of one’s own cancer diagnosis or the sudden accidental death of a
nuclear family member may differ from that of war-related trauma. Still, understanding the
causal effect of health trauma on religiosity, which our military setting allows, has important
value to the literature and key policy relevance. There is a vigorous policy debate about how well
the U.S. Armed Forces has achieved a proper balance in making spiritual services available for
those who demand them, which may be necessary for mission success, while not using publicly
funded resources to proselytize for a particular religion. 40 While our findings suggest that

40

Some advocates argue that the presence of chaplains in combat has led to unconstitutional proselytizing and
endangered combat veterans’ mental health. In a letter written to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in 2010, the
Military Religious Freedom Foundation wrote:
“Perhaps the most alarming…[is]…the widespread practice of ‘battlefield Christian proselytizing.’ When,
on active duty, our service members sought urgently needed mental health counseling while on the
battlefield and with the gun smoke practically still in their faces, they were instead sent to evangelizing

33

combat-induced religiosity is not solely, or even largely, attributable to chaplain-induced
demand, the role of chaplains in providing counseling services — particularly in war theatres
where there is more limited secular competition — remains an important military policy issue
worthy of continued research.
In fact, we know relatively little about (i) the marginal rate of technical substitution of
secular to religious counseling in the production of mental health capital among veterans, and (ii)
whether presence of military chaplains enhances the effectiveness of secular psychological
counseling has not been thoroughly studied. What is clearer is that some veterans turn to
chaplains not because they necessarily perceive their health services are relatively more
effective, but because religious counseling carries less military career risk and is accompanied by
far less social stigma (Morgan et al. 2016). Research examining military policies and
institutional cultural norms that reinforce this stigma, as well as work uncovering the relative
mental health benefits of secular as compared to religious counseling, including how these
effects may differ across servicemembers, will be important for designing military chaplain
policies that maximize the welfare of veterans.

chaplains, who are apparently being used with increasing frequency to provide mental health care due to
the acute shortage of mental health professionals.” (Astore 2010)
On the other hand, columnists at National Review have defended chaplains as indispensable not only to
servicemembers’ emotional well-being, but also to the success of military operations:
"The more dangerous the mission, the more vital chaplains are to its success. The nearly 1,400 chaplains in
the U.S. armed forces…must be on-the-spot counselors to men and women living through a kind of trauma
that few civilians will ever experience. They prepare soldiers to kill and to die without losing their souls.
They help soldiers reintegrate into the lives of their families. Chaplains ministering stateside help military
families left behind get through months of emotional and sometimes financial hardship.” (Dreher, National
Review, 2003)

Notes: Standard errors in Panels I, III, IV, V and VI clustered on the stratum are in parentheses. Statistically
significant at *10%, **5%, ***1%. Regressions in Panels I, III, IV, V, and VI control for military rank, branchspecific major command indicators, number of combat deployments since September 11, education indictors, age,
age squared, and race/ethnicity dummies. The estimates in Panel II are drawn from a matching strategy using nearest
neighbor matching. In Panel II, standard errors are bootstrapped. In the full sample (Panel I and II) we also control
for branch of service. The sample includes male servicemembers only.
