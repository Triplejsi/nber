ABSTRACT
Do the retirement patterns of public-sector workers differ from those in the private sector? Most
private-sector workers today face a do-it-yourself retirement income landscape characterized by
an exposure to market forces through defined-contribution pension plans and private saving, and
the risk of financial insecurity later in life. Public-sector workers, in contrast, are typically
covered by defined-benefit pension plans that both encourage retirement at relatively young ages
and offer financial security at older ages. As a result, the consequences of private- and publicsector workers’ retirement decisions could differ in important ways.
For workers generally, and for private-sector workers in particular, a focus among researchers
and policymakers has been the importance of continued work later in life for improving financial
security at older ages. Such concerns might be of less consequence for public-sector workers due
to the prevalence of defined-benefit pensions. Public-sector workers’ departures from the labor
force might also differ from those in the private sector, all else equal, because of the age-specific
incentives within their defined-benefit plans. Despite these important differences, the privatepublic distinction has received relatively little attention in the retirement literature.
Our paper examines how private- and public-sector workers transition from career employment to
complete labor force withdrawal, with a focus on the role of bridge employment, phased
retirement, and re-entry. We identify the prevalence and determinants of each pathway to
retirement using longitudinal data on four cohorts of private- and public-sector career older
workers from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Our findings suggest that the prevalence
of work after leaving career employment among public-sector workers resembles that of privatesector workers, although with a higher prevalence of part-time bridge employment, a result that
has important implications for public policy as the pace of societal aging accelerates.

Introduction
Do the retirement patterns of public-sector workers in America differ from those in the

private sector? Many private-sector workers today face a do-it-yourself retirement income
landscape characterized by an exposure to market forces through defined-contribution pension
plans and private saving, and the risk of financial insecurity later in life. These conditions stem
from a variety of interactions among the general tide of societal aging, fundamental changes in
the traditional three pillars of retirement income, and changes in the macroeconomic
environment. The relative attractiveness of work and leisure later in life has been altered as a
result, predominantly in favor of additional work. Older Americans, long used to the need for
adaptability within a market-based system, have responded to this new retirement environment.
A nearly 100-year trend toward earlier and earlier retirement among American men came to a
halt in the mid-1980s and has since reversed, albeit at a slower pace in recent years. The labor
force participation rates of older American women have increased even more dramatically.
Not only are older Americans working later in life, but they are also doing so in many
creative ways. Gradual retirement—including phased retirement (a significant reduction in hours
with one’s current employer), bridge employment (continued work with a different employer),
and labor market reentry (a return to the labor force after retirement)—is more common among
older career workers than the stereotypical one-time, permanent exit from the labor force. The
prevalence of each type of gradual retirement is well documented in the literature, with bridge
employment being the most common, followed by reentry (unretirement!) and phased retirement.
The reasons for the relatively high prevalence of bridge employment are many, including older
workers’ preferences for fewer hours and/or more flexibility, the financial incentives associated
with some private pensions, and, in some cases, inadequate financial resources. Involuntary

-1-

transitions from career employment are important as well, as many older workers face physical
limitations, layoffs, or other barriers to continued work on a career job. Some have no choice but
to seek work with another employer if they desire to stay in the labor force.
The impact of continued work on later financial security can be profound, as each year of
additional work can both increase assets available for retirement and reduce the number of years
of leisure that need to be financed. Continued work is also one option that many older workers—
often those in good health and with employment skills still in demand—can control. By the time
they approach traditional retirement ages, individuals can do little to increase their Social
Security wealth, their expected pension income, or their savings. Nor are they likely to have any
impact on Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid reform, all of which might have major impacts
on their economic well-being, or on their employers’ decisions concerning pensions or postretirement health care plans. For many older individuals, the most realistic option for improving
one’s standard of living in retirement is to work more. Of course, another option is to reduce
consumption and one’s standard of living in retirement, but this option is not appealing to many.
Much of the discussion about the importance of continued work later in life is of less
consequence for career public-sector employees. Public-sector employees are typically covered
by defined-benefit pension plans that both encourage retirement at relatively young ages and
offer financial security at older ages. We might therefore expect public-sector employees’
retirement dates to be earlier than those with defined-contribution plans, ceteris paribus, with the
timing of retirement influenced by the age-specific incentives in their defined-benefit plans.
Despite the important differences between the incentives and circumstances faced by
public- and private-sector workers, this distinction has received relatively little attention in the
retirement literature. This paper aims to fill the gap by examining how public- and private-sector

-2-

workers transition from career employment to complete labor force withdrawal, with a focus on
the roles of bridge employment, phased retirement, and reentry. We use data on four cohorts of
older Americans from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally-representative
longitudinal survey of older Americans. The first cohort, the HRS Core, was aged 51 to 61 at the
time of their first survey in 1992. Biennial surveys have since been conducted through 2016 and
new cohorts aged 51 to 56 at the time of their first survey have been added to the HRS every six
years—the War Babies in 1998, the Early Baby Boomers (“Early Boomers”) in 2004, the Mid
Baby Boomers (“Mid Boomers”) in 2010, and the Late Baby Boomers (“Late Boomers”) in
2016. The HRS currently contains data on about 38,000 older Americans over a nearly 25-year
period.
We are interested in not only when older public-sector workers leave their career jobs but
also in how they do so (i.e., the nature of the transitions from career public-sector employment)
and in how the timing of the departure impacts what they do next. For example, do they leave the
labor force or move to another job—or both, in either order. To address these topics, we
construct individual work histories using the longitudinal HRS data. We focus on respondents
who were on a full-time career (FTC) job at the time of their first HRS interview, where an FTC
job is defined as one that consists of 1,600 or more hours per year (full-time) and 10 or more
years of tenure (career). We find that public-sector employees generally follow the same diverse
1

retirement paths that private-sector workers do, albeit with some important distinctions, such as a
higher prevalence of part-time bridge employment, and, among women, a higher prevalence of
phased retirement.
The next section of the paper briefly summarizes the current literature on retirement
patterns and highlights some of the limited number of studies that have examined the retirement

-3-

patterns of public-sector workers. Section 3 describes our data and methods. Sections 4 and 5
describe the prevalence of bridge employment, phased retirement, and reentry, respectively,
among both public- and private-sector workers. Section 6 examines the determinants of gradual
retirement for public- and private-sector workers, with special attention paid to several key
similarities and differences between the two groups. Section 7 discusses the policy relevance of
our findings and Section 8 concludes.

Retirement Patterns
Coile (2015) summarizes the recent literature on the economic correlates of retirement

and the effects of pensions on labor force behavior. The review does not differentiate between
public-sector and private-sector employees, but does describe important factors that differ across
sectors, such as pension and health benefit effects. Cahill, Giandrea, and Quinn (2013a, 2015a)
and Alcover et al. (2014) discuss the literature on bridge jobs and gradual retirement, and how
retirement transitions have evolved over time. This literature extends back to the late 1960s and
1970s, with this early research documenting that retirement is not a one-time, permanent event
for many older Americans (Quinn, Burkhauser, and Meyers, 1990). Since then, research by
Ruhm (1990, 1991), Mutchler et al. (1997), Quinn (1999, 2010), Cahill, Giandrea, and Quinn
(2006, 2011, 2015b), Giandrea, Cahill, and Quinn (2009), Maestas (2010), Wang and Shultz
(2010) and Wang et al. (2014) have confirmed these findings with more recent cohorts of older
Americans. Moreover, the bridge job literature has evolved considerably both within and across
disciplines, as described in Alcover et al. (2014) and a recent article by Cahill, Giandrea, and
Quinn (2018). The general takeaway of this body of literature is that retirement is a complex and
diverse process among older Americans, frequently entailing bridge job transitions, phased
retirement, and reentry, or some combination of the three.

-4-

Looking specifically at the differences between public- and private-sector employees,
Stone and Nouroz (2006) investigate the retirement transitions of older Canadian workers, using
the Canadian Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics to perform both bivariate and multivariate
analyses of retirement transitions. They find that the average retirement age for public-sector
employees has been about one to three years lower than that for private-sector employees since
the mid-1970s. But Stone and Nouroz also ask about the speed with which one exits the labor
force for retirement once the retirement process has begun and whether the speed differs by
sector of employment.
Stone and Nouroz develop a description of both retirement and of the path towards
retirement using a sample of employed individuals aged 45 to 69 in 1996. The path towards
retirement includes steps that signal a diminished attachment to the labor force, such as leaving a
career job, moving to a different job, cutting back on hours worked, and receiving retirementrelated income. These individuals are then followed from 1998 through 2001 to observe whether
the transition ultimately ended up in retirement by the end of 2001, where retirement was defined
as complete labor force withdrawal coupled with receipt of retirement-related income for six
uninterrupted months. The authors then compare the retirement trajectories (the speed at which
individuals make their retirement transitions based on quarterly observations of the sample)
across public- and private-sector employees. They find that among employees who began their
transition in 1996 or 1997, private-sector employees were more likely than those from the public
sector to be retired by 2001. When they condition retirement on other factors, primarily age, the
authors find that this result was heavily dependent on those workers age 60 or older in 1996
(rather than the pooled observations of 45- to 69-year-olds). In fact, they find that retirement
transitions among those who began the transition in 1996 or 1997 are faster for public-sector

-5-

employees relative to private-sector workers for those younger than 60 in 1996. The opposite
effect was found for those 60 or older, with public-sector employees having a longer (or slower)
transition to retirement than private-sector employees. So while average retirement age for
public-sector workers may be consistently lower than that for those in the private sector, the
process of transitioning to retirement differs across both sectors and age.
One important determinant of the retirement transition is savings, particularly pension
savings. Chatterjee (2010) compares retirement savings of U.S. public- and private-sector
employees using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. He finds that public-sector
(U.S. government, in this paper) employees are about one third more likely than non-government
employees to be enrolled in defined-benefit (DB) pension plans and that among those who
participate in defined-contribution (DC) pension plans, public-sector employees make larger
contributions and have larger balances. The higher incidence of defined-benefit pension coverage
among government employees, coupled with the well-studied effects of those pensions on labor
force participation among older individuals, could help create differential employment and
bridge job activity across groups. The picture for defined-contribution plans is more ambiguous
though since lower participation rates among government workers can reduce labor force
participation, while at the same time, the higher defined-contribution plan balances among
government workers act as a wealth effect that can reduce employment.
The state of Texas Pension Review Board compares retirement benefits across publicand private-sector employees (Anumeha, Moore, and Rendon, 2013). They report a 50 percent
reduction over 3 decades in the percentage of private-sector employees who are covered by
defined-benefit retirement pension plans, among those with some type of pension plan (from 73
percent in 1975 to only 36 percent in 2005), while the reduction in defined-benefit pension

-6-

coverage among public-sector employees was modest - from 98 percent to 92 percent. Over this
same time period, defined-contribution pension participation increases, particularly in the private
sector. The Board argues that these changes were strongly affected by both the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which required private-sector employers to
pre-fund defined-benefit pension plans, and, the passage of the Revenue Act of 1978, which
allowed tax-deferred contributions to employer sponsored defined-contribution pension plans.
Due in part to ERISA, defined-benefit pension plan regulations for private-sector employers
have become far more substantial, while states and localities are able to determine rules and
funding for their own public-sector employees. The resulting private sector switch from definedbenefit to defined-contribution pension plans reduces pension costs and obligations among
employers and shifts financial risk from employers to employees.
According to the Texas Board, funding of defined-benefit pension plans differs across
sectors as well. In the private sector, defined-benefit funding is typically the responsibility of the
employer alone, whereas the expense is typically shared among employee and employer in the
public sector. At the same time, many public-sector employees traditionally do not participate in
Social Security. The continued prevalence of defined-benefit pension plans in the public sector is
in part due to the legal responsibility of these public-sector employers to provide a retirement
benefit similar to that which is available through Social Security. The Board illustrates that the
2

differences in pension regulations, participation, and benefits across sectors, in addition to
differences in compensation, have resulted in very different environments and different
incentives for public- and private-sector employees as they approach traditional retirement ages.
The compensation and retirement benefits available to workers differ across public- and
private-sector employees. Bewerunge and Rosen (2013) describe the differences for those

-7-

individuals above age 50 using the 2004 and 2006 waves of the HRS. Controlling for employee
characteristics, they estimate that hourly remuneration (wages plus defined-contribution pension
payments) of federal workers is about one-third higher than for similar private-sector workers
and that the difference stems not from differences in hourly salary across sectors but from
pension differences. Compared with private-sector employees, controlling for demographic
characteristics and educational attainment, the differences in annuitized pension wealth range
from about $6,300 per year for local public employees to almost $8,800 per year for federal
public employees. These differences should be kept in mind when considering the retirement
process decisions of private and public-sector workers.
Much of the apparent difference in the likelihood and timing of retirement transitions
among private and public-sector employees may be associated with differences in retirement
income sources. The decrease in defined-benefit pension plan prevalence among private-sector
employees and their relative stability among public-sector employees is a part of this. Likewise,
the growth of defined-contribution pension plans among private-sector employees and their lack
of age-specific incentives may play a role in explaining retirement differences.
Butrica, Iams, Smith, and Toder (2009) note the decline in defined-benefit coverage in
the U.S. and simulate the effect of a continuation of this trend on retirement incomes. As part of
the simulation, they freeze all private-sector defined-benefit plans and one-third of public-sector
defined-benefit pension plans over the first five years of the simulation. In other words, there are
no additional benefit accruals in the frozen defined-benefit plans, but employers are assumed to
establish or increase contributions to their employees defined-contribution pension plans. The
authors ask how these changes would affect the incomes of individuals when they reach the age
of 67, when most will have exited the labor force. Using the Social Security Administration’s

-8-

Modeling Income in the Near Term simulation model, Butrica et al. project that those who are
near retirement ages when the freezes are implemented would not see a very large reduction in
retirement income, while younger Baby Boomers would see a substantial reduction in definedbenefit income because of low levels of tenure at the time of the pension freeze. If there is a
transition to defined-contribution plans for these individuals, the potential exists to increase
retirement holdings and offset part of the loss of expected defined-benefit pension wealth. This
issue, though, helps illustrate the differential effects faced by private- and public-sector
employees over the previous decades as the retirement income environments for both sectors
have diverged, with more prevalent defined-contribution participation in the private sector and
continued availability of defined-benefit plans, with their guaranteed monthly income streams
through old age, for the public sector.
Another difference across sectors is the prevalence of retiree health insurance. Shoven
and Slavov (2014) report that most public-sector employers offer continued health insurance
coverage to retirees before they become eligible for Medicare benefits, while only about onequarter of large (200 or more employees) private-sector employers provide a similar benefit.
Using data from the HRS, Shoven and Slavov estimate the likelihood of retiring—defined as
ceasing full-time employment between the ages of 55 and 64 (before Medicare eligibility at age
65)—based on an individual’s economic and demographic characteristics and whether retiree
health insurance is available. The availability of retiree health insurance increases the likelihood
of retirement for both private- and public-sector workers, with larger effects for those age 60 to
64 than for those age 55 to 59. The effect is also larger for those in the public sector compared
with the private sector, but the differences are not statistically significant. Importantly, publicsector workers are about twice as likely as private-sector workers to be offered retiree health

-9-

insurance, so the overall impact of retiree health insurance on retirement is more pronounced in
the public sector.
Investigating the continuing differences in retirement income sources among workers,
Munnell, Haverstick, and Soto (2007) explain why defined-benefit pension plans continue to be
offered to public-sector employees. The determinants include higher levels of unionization, an
older and more risk-averse workforce, and a relative lack of regulatory burden for public-sector
employers. Another important factor is the difference in the typical longevity of the employers
across sectors. States and localities are perpetual in nature and are funded by tax revenues, while
private-sector firms depend on the demand for the good or service produced, so the risk of going
out of business and defaulting on a defined-benefit plan are much higher than in the public
sector. These factors have contributed to the differing retirement income environments faced by
public- and private-sector workers nearing retirement.

Data and Methods
We use 13 biennial waves of data from the longitudinal HRS to explore retirement

transitions among public- and private-sector workers. These HRS data include information on
four cohorts of older workers. The first and oldest cohort, the HRS Core, was aged 51 to 61
when first interviewed in 1992 (n=12,652). Each subsequent cohort was aged 51 to 56 at the
3

time of their first survey, with the cohorts added every six years after 1992. The War Babies
were added in 1998 (n=2,529), the Early Boomers in 2004 (n=3,330) and the Mid Boomers in
2010 (n=4,992). The follow-up periods for the cohorts so far range from 24 years among the
HRS Core (1992 to 2016) to six years among the Mid Boomers (2010 to 2016).
Our analysis focuses on retirement transitions from career employment. For each HRS
cohort we identify respondents who, at the time of their first survey, were wage-and-salary

- 10 -

workers on a FTC job, defined to be one that consisted of at least 10 years of tenure and 1,600 or
more hours per year. In prior research, we tested variations on this FTC definition, from 5 to 20
years of tenure and found that such changes did not alter our general conclusions about
retirement patterns (Cahill, Giandrea, and Quinn, 2006).
We then disaggregate our FTC wage-and-salary respondents by sector. The HRS survey
asks whether the respondent had ever been employed by a unit of a state, county, or local
government or by the federal government. Respondents who responded affirmatively were then
asked about the dates of this government employment. We use this information to identify the
public- or private-sector status of the respondent’s job at the time of the first interview. For each
FTC respondent, we then examine the work history from this career job through complete labor
force withdrawal and beyond, to check for unretirements, or until the time of the last completed
survey for those who remain employed or who drop out of the HRS because of death or other
sample attrition.
Our three categories of gradual retirement—bridge employment, phased retirement, and
reentry—are benchmarked by our definitions of both FTC employment and retirement.
Specifically, a bridge job is defined as any job with a new employer that takes place after the last
FTC employment. Phased retirement is defined as a 20 percent or more reduction in hours with
one’s career employer. Reentry is defined as a return to paid work following two survey waves
of non-work following an exit from FTC employment or from a bridge job (Figure 1).
We first conduct a series of cross-sectional analyses of labor force status (i.e., still
working in career employment (with and without a reduction in hours of 20 percent or more (i.e.,
phased retirement)), transitioned to another job (full-time or part-time), or not working) for each
of the four cohorts in each survey year, and for public- and private-sector workers separately.

- 11 -

This provides a first glimpse at possible differences in the retirement patterns by sector. We then
examine retirement transitions in a longitudinal context, and examine the prevalence of bridge
employment, phased retirement, and reentry for public- and private-sector workers. In doing so
we conduct three separate analyses to take into account the different follow-up periods that are
available for each of our four cohorts. First, we examine outcomes using all available data (i.e.,
ranging from 24 years among the HRS Core respondents to six years among the Mid Boomers).
We then conduct an analysis using all four cohorts and a uniform six-year follow-up period—the
length of follow up available for the youngest cohort, the Mid Boomers. Finally, we use the first
three cohorts only with a 12-year follow-up period—the length of follow up currently available
for the Early Boomers.
Our analysis of the determinants of gradual retirement begins with a series of bivariate
comparisons, for public- and private-sector workers separately, using known determinants of
retirement and our outcomes of interest: the prevalence of bridge employment, phased
retirement, and post-retirement reentry. Time-varying attributes are measured as of the wave
prior to the respondent’s first transition from career employment.
We then control for confounding factors by estimating a multinomial logistic regression
with a three-way outcome variable: (1) still on FTC job or last observed on an FTC job; (2)
moved to a bridge job; and (3) exited the labor force directly. The model is as follows:
R∗"# = α + β* X" + β, X"#-* + β. Cohort " + β4 Public" + ε"

(1)

where i stands for individual and t stands for the wave in which the first transition from career
∗
employment is made. 𝑅=>
is a latent variable that determines the observed choice, 𝑅=> , which

denotes whether the individual moved to a bridge job or exited directly from the labor force by
time t. Time invariant and time varying characteristics are represented by 𝑋= and 𝑋=>-* ,

- 12 -

respectively. These characteristics include demographic and economic traits known to be
significant determinants of the retirement process, such as age, health status, pension status,
spouse’s employment status, and wage rate. The specification shown in Model 1 includes
controls for HRS cohort and sector (private or public), and is estimated separately for men and
for women. As with the descriptive analysis, all time varying variables are measured as of the
wave prior to the transition from career employment. ε" is a white noise error term. Coefficients
are transformed into relative risk ratios (RRR) with those remaining in FTC employment as the
base category.
Next we estimate a logistic regression model of part-time work in bridge employment,
conditional on having transitioned to a bridge job. The right-hand side variables in this model
resemble those in Model 1, with both time invariant and time-varying determinants of part-time
status, along with cohort controls and a dichotomous indicator for career public employee. The
dependent variable, H"#∗ , is a latent variable that determines the observed choice, H"# —a zero-one
indicator of whether the respondent is working part time (less than 1,600 hours per year) in
bridge employment. Time-varying factors are measured as of the wave prior to transition from
career employment and the model is estimated separately for men and women.
We also estimate logistic regression models of phased retirement and reentry. For phased
retirement, the dependent variable is equal to one if the respondent reduced hours worked on the
career job by 20 percent or more, and zero otherwise. As with Model 1, the explanatory variables
are measured as of the latest survey in which the respondent was working full time on a career
job. For reentry, the dependent variable is equal to one if the respondent reentered the labor force
after having been out for at least two consecutive survey waves. For those who reentered, timevarying demographic variables (health status of the respondent and spouse, marital status, work

- 13 -

status of spouse, presence of a dependent child, census region), and non-job-related economic
variables (home ownership, wealth) are measured as of the wave prior to reentry. Like the bridge
employment and part-time employment models, the phased retirement and reentry models are
estimated for men and women separately, with the explanatory variables measured as of the
wave the respondent left paid work.

Results
More than nine out of ten HRS Core men had work experience since age 49 and about

one half were working on a FTC job at the time of their first interview in 1992 (Table 1). Among
HRS Core women, nearly eight out of ten had work experience since age 49 and 38 percent were
on a FTC job at the time of their first interview. The percentages for work experience since age
49 were generally lower among the HRS War Babies, Early Boomers, and Mid Boomers, as
expected, given the different age range at the time of the first interview for these three cohorts.
The prevalence of FTC employment at the time of the first interview, however, was generally
similar across all four cohorts for both men and for women.

Across all four HRS cohorts, about one quarter of career workers (20-25 percent of career
men and 21-30 percent of career women) held jobs in the public sector at the time of their first
interview (Table 1, bottom two rows)—a total 1,803 respondents, of which 926 were men (51%)
and 877 were women (49%). Nearly one half of these observations belonged to the HRS Core
sample, due to the larger sample size and the broader age range of interviewees.

4.1

Cross-sectional Analysis of Labor Force Participation Among Publicand Private-Sector Older Workers
A cross-sectional examination of labor force status shows that public- and private-sector

men differed only slightly with respect to their transitions from career employment six years (the
most we have for Mid Boomers) after the first interview (see the darker shading in tables 2a and
2b). The percentage of public-sector men who moved to another job, for example, was 25
percent among the HRS Core compared with 26 percent of private-sector workers. Among the
much younger Mid-Boomers, the difference was slightly larger (21 percent vs. 26 percent,
respectively). Twelve years beyond the first interview public-private sector differences were
generally similar (26 percent and 28 percent, respectively, among the War Babies, and 23
percent and 27 percent among the Early Boomers—see the lighter shading in Tables 2a and 2b).
An important finding from this cross-sectional analysis that persists throughout our
analyses is the difference between public- and private-sector workers with respect to part-time
bridge employment. For those respondents who did move to another job, public-sector workers
were always much more likely than private-sector ones to be working part time in bridge
employment and twice as likely in three of the four male cohorts (e.g., 55% vs. 41% among the
HRS Core and 54% vs. 28% among the War Baby men). In contrast, the prevalence of phased
retirement generally remains below 10 percent in each year, with the notable exception of those
who remain in career employment at older ages, and by and large does not differ meaningfully
between public- and private-sector men.
Among career women, in contrast, the percentage of public-sector workers transitioning
to another job six years following the first interview was always lower than that of private-sector
workers across all cohorts: 22 vs. 27 percent among the HRS Core, 26 vs. 31 percent among the

- 15 -

War Babies, 17 vs. 31 percent among the Early Boomers, and 19 vs. 22 percent among the Mid
Boomers. These differences persisted twelve years following the first interview among the HRS
Core and the Early Boomers, but narrowed among the War Baby women. Similar to the men,
public-sector women who transitioned to another job were substantially more likely than privatesector women to be working part time. The prevalence of phased retirement among public- and
private-sector women varies by cohort and by year, although a clear pattern does not emerge. As
we note below, a pattern does emerge in the longitudinal work, with public-sector women having
a higher prevalence of phased retirement compared with private-sector women.
The takeaway from the cross-sectional analysis is that public-sector women and, to a
lesser extent, public-sector men had a lower prevalence of transitioning to another job following
career employment. When a transition was made, public-sector career workers were more likely
than their private-sector counterparts to be working part time in these positions. The next set of
analyses examine bridge job prevalence based on individual work histories using the longitudinal
nature of the HRS.

Longitudinal Analysis of Gradual Retirement Among Public- and
Private-Sector Older Workers
Roughly one half of the HRS respondents who left career employment moved to a bridge

job rather than out of the labor force (Tables 3a and 3b, column 7). This is consistent with
considerable literature on the tremendous importance of bridge job employment in the retirement
process (Alcover et al., 2014; Cahill, Giandrea, and Quinn, 2015b, 2018). As with the crosssectional findings above, bridge job prevalence among public-sector workers was generally
lower than that among private-sector workers, with the difference ranging from two to 17
percentage points. One exception was the War Baby men for whom bridge job prevalence was
- 16 -

two percentage points higher among public-sector workers than private-sector ones (Table 3a).
Also consistent with the cross-sectional results, public- and private-sector workers differed
substantially with respect to the number of hours that they worked in bridge employment.
Among the HRS men, public-sector workers who transitioned to a bridge job were 18 to 36
percentage points more likely to be working part time than those in the private sector (27% vs.
45% among the Early Boomer men and 25% vs. 61% among the Mid-Boomer men). A similar
pattern existed for the HRS women, with the differences ranging from 12 to 24 percentage
points.
Consistent with prior research on the prevalence of phased retirement (defined here as a
reduction in career job hours of 20 percent or more) and reentry (defined here as a return to the
labor force after being out for at least two HRS waves), we find that both of these forms of
gradual retirement are considerably less common than bridge employment among both publicand private-sector workers. We also find that public-sector women and, to a lesser extent, men
are more likely than those in the private sector to have reduced hours in career employment later
in life. Among respondents who were on their FTC job in 2016 or who were last observed on
their FTC job, public-sector workers were generally about twice as likely as private-sector
workers to reduce hours by 20 percent or more. A similar relationship also holds among the
women, but not men, who left their career jobs. Small sample sizes limit the extent we can
evaluate reentry decisions among public-sector workers, but we do find that the percentage of
public-sector men reentering was 3 to 7 percentage points lower than that of private-sector men
(14% vs. 17% among HRS Core men and 8% vs. 15% among HRS War Baby men – Table 3A,
column 11), perhaps because of fewer negative pension surprises with DB plans. Differences in
reentry rates by sector were almost identical among the HRS Core and War Baby women.

- 17 -

Reentry rates were actually higher among public-sector women than private-sector ones, perhaps
an anomaly due to the relatively short follow-up period for this cohort and the lower rates of
reentry generally among women.
A question remains as to whether the cohorts differ when the follow-up period is held
constant. To address this issue, we restrict the follow-up period first to six years for all cohorts
(Table 3b) and then to 12 years for the first three cohorts (Table 3c). Bridge job prevalence
ranges from 51 percent to 64 percent among those who transitioned from career employment
within six years of their first interview. This finding is consistent with the results in Table 3a,
combined with the notion that bridge job prevalence declines with age, as those who transition
from career employment within six years are generally younger than those who transition
afterwards. Bridge job prevalence remains lower among the public-sector career workers relative
to the private-sector ones by four to 12 percentage points for seven of the eight gender-cohort
groups. The one exception is the War Baby men for whom bridge job prevalence within six years
of the first interview is higher among public-sector men (66% among public-sector men vs. 59%
among private-sector men). Differences by sector in the part-time status of bridge employment
remain with the six-year follow-up period. Public-sector men were 26 to 39 percentage points
more likely than private-sector men to be working part time on their bridge job (58% vs. 32%
among public-and private-sector HRS Core respondents and 66% vs. 27% among the War
Babies). Like the full follow-up period analysis, differences in part-time status by sector among
women were lower than those among men, but still pronounced (between 15 and 23 percentage
points higher among public-sector women than their private-sector counterparts). Phased
retirement and reentry could not be examined with the six-year follow-up period because of the
limited timeframe.

- 18 -

The patterns noted above regarding bridge job prevalence, the part-time status of bridge
jobs, and phased retirement are also seen when the follow-up period is expanded to 12 years
(Table 3c). The results for reentry, however, are mixed in this analysis. The prevalence of reentry
is lower among public-sector men compared with private-sector men for the War Baby and Early
Boomer cohorts, but not the HRS Core, and no clear pattern with respect to reentry is found
among the women across the three cohorts. This finding is likely a product of the 12-year followup period, which limits the extent to which reentry decisions can be examined.
To summarize the findings in Tables 3a-c, bridge job prevalence is modestly lower
among public-sector workers compared with private-sector ones. The most notable difference by
sector is with respect to hours worked in bridge employment. Phased retirement, while much less
common than bridge employment, plays a larger role in the gradual retirements of public-sector
workers than private ones, while reentry plays a smaller one.

4.3

Determinants of Gradual Retirement Among Public- and Private-Sector
Older Workers
The next step of the analysis focuses on the determinants of these retirement decisions.

First, do public workers’ subjective descriptions of their gradual retirement decisions differ from
those of private-sector workers? A higher percentage of public-sector men than private-sector
men who transition to bridge employment report “retired” as their reason for leaving their career
jobs (63% vs. 29% among HRS Core men and 57% vs. 22% among War Baby men) (Table 4a).
The same pattern is true among women (Table 4b), though the percentage differences are lower
(33% vs. 17% among HRS Core women and 36% vs. 9% among War Baby women). As might
be expected, public-sector career workers are much less likely than private-sector ones to report
“business closed” and “laid off” as their reason for leaving career employment for a bridge job
- 19 -

(less than 6% among public-sector men and women and between 11% and 16% among privatesector men and women). More generally, public-sector workers were more likely than privatesector ones to report voluntary reasons only for leaving career employment (80% to 91% among
public-sector career workers compared with 58 to 72% among private-sector career workers). In
5

short, public- and private-sector workers do indeed differ with respect to their stated reasons for
leaving career employment.
We next examine the extent to which public- and private-sector workers differ with
respect to known objective determinants of gradual retirement. Not surprisingly, bridge job
prevalence generally declines with age at transition from FTC job (although not always
monotonically), and generally increases with better self-reported health status and higher
educational attainment (Tables 5a-b for men; 5c-d for women). Bridge job prevalence is also
higher among those who are married compared with those who are not, and higher among the
married with a working spouse than the married without one. The prevalence of labor market
reentry also declines with age, increases with self-reported health status, and is higher among
those with a working spouse—all reasonable results. In contrast to bridge job activity, the
prevalence of reentry is higher among those with less formal education and those who are not
married, perhaps those less prepared to handle negative post-retirement shocks. Phased
retirement increases with higher rated self-reported health status and educational attainment but,
in contrast to both bridge employment and reentry, increases with age. One explanation for the
latter result is that older workers who remain in career employment might be more likely than
their younger counterparts to request phased retirement.
Regarding differences by sector, public-sector workers were slightly older than privatesector workers at the time of their transition from career employment. The percentage of public-

- 20 -

sector men and women who transitioned from career employment prior to age 56 was,
respectively, 2 to 6 percentage points and 5 to 12 percentage points lower than private-sector
men and women. With the exception of the Early Boomer men, public-sector career workers
were also less likely than private-sector ones to report their health as fair or poor (between 4 and
8 percentage points among men, and between 2 and 10 percentage points among women).
Finally, public-sector workers were substantially more likely than private-sector workers to have
a college degree, with the difference ranging from 12 to 30 percentage points among men and
women.
Interestingly, two of these three attributes—higher self-described health status and higher
educational attainment—might, at first glance, suggest a higher prevalence of bridge job activity
among public-sector workers compared with private-sector ones. One possible explanation is that
other determinants of bridge employment play an even larger role and, as we explain below,
economic factors are indeed important drivers of gradual retirement. Another hypothesis is that
bridge job prevalence might differ by sector within key health status and educational attainment
subgroups. For example, among the Core men, 28 percent of public-sector workers who reported
their health as fair or poor transitioned to a bridge job, compared with 38 percent of privatesector men who did so. Among the Core women, however, the analogous percentages were 43
and 36 percent—the opposite direction compared to the men. Bridge job prevalence for publicsector workers with a college degree is somewhat lower than that for private-sector workers with
a college degree. Clear patterns within specific subgroups do not appear to exist.
Regarding phased retirement and reentry, the general patterns by age, health status,
educational attainment, and other demographic characteristics among public-sector workers
resemble those of private-sector ones.

- 21 -

Key differences by sector also emerge with respect to several job and economic
characteristics known to influence gradual retirement decisions. Public-sector career workers are
generally more likely than private-sector ones to be white collar and have health insurance that is
portable (i.e., after leaving career employment), a defined-benefit pension plan, higher wages,
and, to a lesser extent, higher levels of wealth (Tables 6a – 6d). Specifically, more than one half
of the public-sector career men and women were white collar compared to about one third of
those in the private sector. Access to health insurance that is portable—either employer-provided
retiree health insurance or health insurance not tied to career employment (i.e., private or through
a spouse’s health insurance)—has been declining over time and therefore declines across the
HRS cohorts. Across cohorts, however, differences between public- and private-sector workers
persist, with the percentage of public-sector workers with portable health insurance between
seven and 22 percentage points higher than that of private-sector workers. Access to a definedbenefit pension plan is also declining over time and therefore across HRS cohorts and the
prevalence of DB plans is consistently higher among public-sector workers compared with
private-sector ones. The difference in prevalence ranges from 16 to 36 percentage points. Finally,
public-sector workers are considerably less likely (by 13 to 26 percentage points) to be earning a
wage of $15 per hour or less. These differences in job and economic characteristics would
6

suggest, broadly, a mixed effect on the prevalence of gradual retirement for public-sector
workers. The higher prevalence of white-collar workers, higher wages, and portable health
insurance among public-sector workers suggests a higher prevalence of bridge job activity
among public-sector workers, while access to a defined-benefit plan suggests a lower one.
As with the demographic characteristics, bridge job prevalence does not appear to differ
by sector within specific economic categories (e.g., defined-benefit pension status), with one

- 22 -

exception. Bridge job activity among the Early Boomer women in the public sector is
substantially higher than that in the private sector within occupational, health insurance, pension,
and wage subgroups. This result is consistent with prior literature that suggests differences by
gender have emerged in the retirement patterns of the Early Boomers (Cahill, Giandrea, and
Quinn, 2013b).
An examination of phased retirement and reentry within economic subgroups is limited
by the relatively small sample sizes in important subgroups (e.g., public-sector workers with no
health insurance). For subgroups where comparisons can be made, public- and private-sector
men do not appear to differ systematically with respect to the prevalence of phased retirement
and reentry within economic characteristic subgroups. Among women, however, phased
retirement is notably higher for public-sector women than private-sector ones for those with
white-collar, highly-skilled jobs (18-21% vs. 7-11%, respectively, across cohorts), portable
health insurance (13%-19% vs. 7-8%, respectively, across cohorts), defined-benefit pensions
(11-20% vs. 5-8%, respectively, across cohorts), defined-contribution pensions (10-41% vs. 411%, respectively, across cohorts), and higher wages ($25-$49 per hour) (23-32% vs. 7-12%,
respectively, across cohorts). These differences by sector among women pertain only to phased
retirement as similar patterns are not seen with respect to reentry.
Prior to examining retirement determinants in a multivariate context in the next section,
we note that the outcomes of gradual retirement could also differ by public- and private-sector
status. To gain some initial insights on this topic, we compare wages in career employment with
wages in bridge employment for those who made such a transition. Interestingly, the crosscohort differences are most noteworthy (Table 7). Both public- and private-sector HRS Core men
and women experienced a general decline in their wages when transitioning to bridge

- 23 -

employment. For example, among public-sector men who transitioned to a bridge job, one fifth
had wages below $15 per hour (inflation adjusted) on their career job whereas about 40 percent
did so on their bridge job. Among private-sector men who transitioned to a bridge job, 37 percent
had wages below $15 per hour whereas more than one half (54%) did on their bridge job. These
declines are not seen among the Early Boomers and Mid-Boomers, suggesting that those who
move to bridge employment at younger ages generally do not experience wage declines. A more
detailed analysis of wage differences between career and bridge employment seems warranted in
future research.

4.4

Multivariate Analysis of Gradual Retirement Among Public- and
Private-Sector Older Workers
The differences in the important demographic and economic characteristics by sector,

with some suggesting a higher prevalence of gradual retirement among pubic-sector workers
(e.g., more likely to be college educated and white-collar) and others suggesting a lower
prevalence (e.g., older at transition and more likely to have a defined-benefit pension), suggest a
multivariate approach that takes many characteristics into account. Controlling for the
demographic and economic characteristics described above using the multinomial logistic
regression model specified in Equation 1, pooling age-eligible respondents from each cohort, and
estimating separate equations for men and women, we find that public-sector workers’
transitions from career employment are not statistically different from those of private-sector
workers (Table 8). Importantly, many of the characteristics that distinguish public-sector
7

workers from private-sector ones, such as age at the time of transition, self-reported health status,
and levels of educational attainment are statistically significant determinants of bridge
employment in the multivariate model. Other known predictors of bridge employment, such as
- 24 -

occupation, pension status, and health insurance status, are also significant predictors of bridge
employment, albeit only for certain subcategories, and with differences by gender. For example,
the presence of a defined-benefit plan lowers the probability of bridge employment among
women relative to those without a pension (RRR=0.570; p-value=0.000). The direction of the
impact is the same for men, but the difference is not statistically significant. Similarly, men in
non-highly skilled blue-collar occupations are more likely to exit the labor force directly from
career employment than highly-skilled white-collar workers (RRR=1.362; p-value=0.043), a
finding that is not statistically significant for women.
The descriptive analysis above revealed that public- and private-sector workers differed
with respect to the number of hours worked in bridge employment, with part-time bridge
employment much more prevalent among public-sector workers than private-sector ones. This
result is confirmed in the multivariate analysis (Table 9). Public-sector men are well more than
twice as likely as private-sector men to be working part-time in bridge employment (OR=2.643;
p-value=0.000) and public-sector women are nearly twice as likely as private-sector women to be
working part-time in bridge employment (OR=1.855; p=0.002). Age at the time of transition, not
surprisingly, is a strong determinant of part-time bridge employment, but the majority of
demographic and economic characteristics included in the model, measured at the time of
transition, are not significant predictors of part-time bridge employment. This result suggests that
the determinants of working part-time in bridge employment differ from those that influence the
choice of gradual retirement compared with direct exit.
Another area where public- and private-sector workers differed in the descriptive analysis
is with respect to phased retirement. These differences hold in a multivariate context for women
only. All else equal, career public-sector women are significantly more likely than those in the

- 25 -

private-sector to lower the number of hours worked in career employment by 20 percent or more
(OR=1.733; p-value=0.001) (Table 10). As with the bridge job models, age at the time of
transition, health status, and educational attainment, are significant determinants of both phased
retirement and reentry. The fact that public-sector status is a statistically significant predictor of
phased retirement among women, but not men, is noteworthy. Assuming that demand-side
barriers to reducing hours in public-sector career employment do not differ by gender, this
finding suggests that supply-side factors could be driving the result, and the extent to which such
factors are voluntary (i.e., desire for more leisure time) or involuntary (i.e., elder care
responsibilities) for women warrants further exploration in future research.

5

Policy Relevance
The retirement patterns of career public-sector workers are diverse, just as they are in the

private sector. Approximately one half of full-time career public-sector workers transition to a
bridge job prior to exiting the labor force, which is only slightly lower than their private-sector
counterparts. Career public-sector workers also resemble career private-sector workers with
respect to reentering the labor force after an initial departure. Of the three components of gradual
retirement, phased retirement is the one in which public- and private-sector career workers
appear to differ. In particular, among women, the prevalence of phased retirement is higher
among career public-sector workers compared with private-sector ones though, importantly, the
overall prevalence of phased retirement among both groups is low relative to that of bridge
employment. The prevalence of phased retirement among men does not differ significantly by
sector.
Where public- and private-sector workers differ most is with respect to the hours worked
upon leaving career employment, with part-time bridge employment being more common among

- 26 -

public-sector workers than private-sector ones. This finding has important policy implications.
Public-sector workers, on average, have characteristics that would suggest a higher degree of
financial security in retirement, not only with respect to the availability of a defined-benefit
pension, but also with respect to their self-reported health status, educational attainment, wages,
and wealth. These characteristics, in combination with public-sector workers’ subjective
responses about why they left career employment, presented in Tables 4a and 4b, suggest that the
gradual retirement decisions of public-sector workers are largely voluntary. Public-sector
workers appear to remain in the labor force on a part-time basis because they want to not because
they have to financially.
Public sector workers’ preferences for gradual retirement highlight a potential
opportunity for public employers, as policies that facilitate phased retirements can help stave off
abrupt retirements and the disruptions in workflow they might cause, especially in this era of
rapid societal aging. The key to capitalizing on this opportunity is to properly incentivize
continued employment in the public sector. For some public workers such incentives will not
matter, as bridge employment provides an opportunity to try a new line of work. For others,
however, the choice between continued work in the public sector and part-time bridge
employment elsewhere could be marginal, and the right incentives could shift the decision in
favor of continued public-sector employment.
In 2014, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) offered a formal phased retirement
option to some federal workers, which is an important development in this regard (U.S. Office of
Personnel Management, 2018). A key feature of this policy is that federal workers who qualify
8

can receive a prorated pension while scaling back their hours (prorated based on the number of
hours they are not working). Perhaps more importantly, the size of workers’ pension benefits,

- 27 -

when they do retire completely, are not negatively impacted by reducing their hours later in life,
as would be the case with some final-average-salary formulas. Employees also continue to
receive service credits (adjusted for hours) while working.

9

More broadly, the benefit formulas and early retirement incentives within defined-benefit
plans present challenges for phased retirement options, and highlight a key tradeoff particularly
relevant to the current retirement income landscape. On one side, the financial security that DB
plans provide to public employees is a strong positive attribute. DB plans also help public
employers to attract new workers through deferred compensation, and also to retire older
workers through early retirement incentives. The latter feature is now limiting the gradual
retirement options of some older workers, however, thus prompting the need for policies such as
OPM’s formal phased retirement policy. How this barrier to phased retirement compares with the
net benefits of DB plans (e.g., net of the financial burden that such plans have imposed on local
and state governments) could inform policy decisions about the attractiveness of DB plans in the
public sector going forward.
Another important consideration is the balance between attributes of public- and privatesector employment generally. The relative job stability, generous defined-benefit plans, and
regular work hours in the public-sector are features that can counterbalance higher salaries in the
private sector. As such, the well-documented shift toward DC plans away from DB plans in the
private sector may have also shifted the relative attractiveness of public-sector employment.
One aspect of this shift is that private-sector workers now bear investment risk in saving
for retirement and they are responsible for determining how to withdraw the money from their
retirement accounts so that they do not outlive their assets. One way to address the latter issue is
for workers to purchase immediate annuities. Retirees currently have the option to purchase

- 28 -

immediate annuities, but relatively few do so (Brown, 2007). Research has also shown that DC
plan participation increases when participation is the default and employees must opt-out if they
do not want to participate (Beshears, Choi, Laibson, and Madrian, 2010; Butrica and
Karamcheva, 2015). It is possible that a similar opt-out provision for immediate annuities could
have a similar effect on the number of retirees that choose to annuitize all or part of their
retirement account.
Whether this type of arrangement is feasible will depend on the ability of companies to
minimize the fees for setting up the annuity and to ensure that the insurance companies
managing the annuity payments are financially secure. It would also be necessary to determine
the fraction of the retirement account that is annuitized and whether the annuity payments are
tied to inflation. Early research on opt-out DC plans was conducted by getting a few companies
to change the default (Holden and VanDerhei, 2005). Employees could easily reverse this
decision at any time, but it is more complicated to get out of an annuity after payments have
started. All this being said, it is worth noting that almost all workers will receive Social Security,
which provides risk-free fully-indexed annuity payments.
Many older Americans face financial challenges later in life, especially those without a
defined-benefit employer pension. One option for reducing financial insecurity later in life, for
those physically able to do so and with demand for their skills, is continued work (Munnell and
Sass, 2008; Quinn and Cahill, 2016, 2018). Should a DB-to-DC shift take place in the public
10

sector, the retirement patterns of today’s public-sector workers suggest that continued work later
in life could help secure their financial well-being after retirement.
Another policy-relevant topic is the role of public-sector employment as a bridge job.
This paper focuses on the retirement transitions of career public-sector workers. Transitions from

- 29 -

career private-sector employment into public-sector employment might also be worth some
attention, especially in the context of so-called encore jobs—those that serve a social purpose in
addition to financial compensation. Such arrangements might benefit both career private-sector
workers as well as public employers, as they tap into a highly experienced workforce. Some
policies may help facilitate these arrangements. One option is to help reduce barriers to hiring
older workers in the public-sector, perhaps by streamlining the hiring and training process for
more experienced applicants, or by offering part-time positions with a set tenure commitment.
Such a structure could be appealing to older career private-sector workers looking for
meaningful work that contributes to the broader community.

Conclusion
This paper explores work after departure from career employment in the public and

private sectors, with a focus on the roles of bridge jobs, phased retirement, and reentry. We find
that the diverse retirement patterns that have been well documented in the private-sector
literature apply also to career public-sector workers. Bridge employment is most common, with
about one half of workers transitioning to a bridge job following career employment, followed
by labor market reentry and phased retirement, which have prevalence rates in the single to low
double digits. Differences by sector exist with respect to hours worked in bridge employment,
with public-sector career workers being more likely than private-sector ones to work part time.
Among women, public-sector career workers are also more likely than those in the private sector
to experience phased retirement—defined in this paper as a reduction in career job hours by 20
percent or more.
From a policy standpoint, what is most notable about the gradual retirements of publicsector career workers is that they are so similar to those in the private sector. To our surprise,

- 30 -

public-sector workers are not more likely than private-sector workers to choose one-time,
permanent exits from the labor force (“traditional” retirements). Instead, workers in both sectors
exhibit remarkable flexibility when it comes to continued work later in life. This flexibility is a
bright spot among the many challenges our society is confronting as the population continues to
age rapidly over the next ten years. The diverse retirement patterns of public- and private-sector
workers expand options for continued work later in life among older Americans, helping to
strengthen families’ financial well-being, employers’ needs for a talented and experienced
workforce, and society’s goals for the production of more goods and services to support our
aging population.

We have experimented with alternatives to requiring 10 years for career status and 1,600 hours

per year for full-time status. Reasonable changes to the definition of a career job do not
substantially change any of our conclusions.

Anumeha, Moore, and Rendon (2013) note that Social Security retirement coverage was not

available to public-sector workers until 1951. Between 1951 and 1991 public-sector employers
had the option to participate in Social Security. In 1991 the federal government required state
and local public-sector employers not covered by Social Security to offer either a defined-benefit
pension plan with benefits comparable to Social Security retirement benefits, or a definedcontribution retirement plan in which at least 7.5 percent of an employee’s compensation is
allocated to retirement savings. See https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2014-title26vol15/xml/CFR-2014-title26-vol15-sec31-3121b7-2.xml.

The HRS includes cohorts older than the HRS Core respondents. The Asset and Health

Dynamics of the Oldest Old (AHEAD) dataset was a survey of Americans born prior to 1924.
The survey began in 1993 and was folded into the HRS in 1998 (Karp, 2007; Survey Research
Center, 2017).

4

One exception is the War Baby men who, in 1998, had a higher prevalence of FTC employment

at the time of the first interview than men in the other cohorts (68% compared with 52 to 56%;
among women, the percentages ranged from 38% to 40%).

5

One exception is War Baby women in the public sector for whom 48 percent reported voluntary

reasons only for leaving their career job and exiting directly.

6

Wages are measured in 2012 dollars.

7

Age-eligible HRS Core respondents were aged 51 to 61 at the time of the first interview. Age-

eligible respondents for the War Babies, Early Boomers, and Mid Boomers were aged 51 to 56 at
the time of the first interview.

8

The OPM website describes the policy as follows: “Phased Retirement is a human resources

tool that allows full-time employees to work part-time schedules while beginning to draw
retirement benefits. This new tool will allow managers to better provide unique mentoring
opportunities for employees while increasing access to the decades of institutional knowledge
and experience that retirees can provide […] This is yet another forward thinking policy that
allows the Administration to continue its efforts to deliver a Government that is effective,
efficient, and supportive of economic growth” (U.S. Office of Personnel Management, 2018).

9

Specifically, the OPM policy states: “Employees participating in phased retirement will be paid

for the part-time service they continue to provide the government and will receive additional
credit for that service toward their full retirement. These employees will also begin receiving
partial annuity payments, prorated based on the portion of the workweek that they are not
scheduled to work” (Chief Human Capital Officers Council, 2018).

See Clark and Morrill (2016) for a discussion of the employer side of continued work later in

life.
