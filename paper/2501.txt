The Baby Booms Legacy:
Relative Wages in the 21st Century

ABSTRACT

This paper assesses the impact of the post MMII baby boom on
relative wages, when this baby boom cohort becomes the oldest segment
of the workforce.

Time series data are used to estimate a model of the

demand for workers in eight age/sex groupings.

Using these estimates,

we simulate relative wages in the year 2020 assuming the age/sex
composition of the workforce behaves according to projections. The
results are used to examine the baby boom's potential impact on wages
of older, prime-age, and teenage workers, as well as the anticipated
wage gap between males and females.

THE BABY BOOM'S LEGACY:
RELATIVE WAGES IN THE 21ST CENTURY
The economic impact of the large cohort born between 1946 and 1964
has been explored by several researchers.

Analysis to date focuses

mainly on the downward pressure on baby boomer's wages as their cohort
entered the labor force (cf. Freeman, 1979; Russell, 1982; Welch,
1979)

booms

The present paper extends this literature by assessing the baby
impact on relative wages in the year 2020 when this generation

will be the oldest segment of the workforce.
Several important

public policy questions are addressed.

First,

will the changing demographic structure decrease the relative wages of
prime-age workers? If so, there may be justification

for social policy

among those age 55+ to lessen downward

encouraging early retirement

pressure on prime—age workers' wages.

A second question that the

research addresses is, how will the graying of the workforce affect
teeenage workers wages? Because teens' wages and school attendance are
linked, pay reductions

may influence their investments in human capital

and future earnings potential (Ehrenberg and Marcus, l982.

Finally,

we investigate whether changing age structures are predicted to affect
the female/male wage gap forty years hence.

The analysis uses national time series data (from 1955 to 1984) to
estimate an econometric model of the demand for workers in eight
different

age/sex categories.

predict changes in relative wages to the year 2020, when the youngest
of the baby boom group will be over age 55.

I.

Methodology and Date
Mamermesh and Grant (1979) recommend using a production function

approach to compute how wages would change in response to changes in
factor quantities.

Rather than estimating a translog model directly,

we estimate the coefficients in the relevant output share equations.
In the empirical application below, cost shares will be utilized as the
dependent variable since in competitive equilibrium they are equal to
output shares.
Estimated coefficients are used to compute elasticities of
complementacityand factor price elasticities.

Elasticity variances

are computed by applying the delta methodJ
Coefficient estimates will also be employed in the policy
simulation to determine the total effect of a changing labor force on
relative wage rates. The effect of a quantity change (%A X) on wages

Like all production function models, the framework assumes that
input supply changes are exogenously determined.

We do not attempt to

relax this assumption since there exist few instruments in time series
data.

Policy Simulation

To determine the impact on relative wages caused by the aging of
the workforce, we apply the simulation formula above to our coefficient
estmates and projections of how the entire age distribution is likely
to change over time. Table 2 reports two projections of labor force
patterns between 1985 and 2020 by age/sex subgroup obtained from data
published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and the Social
Security Administration

(SSA)

However, when we consider

males and females separately, we see

that prime—age women will be hurt relative to older workers.

The

predicted increase of 1.2 to 5.6% for older workers is contrasted with
a 10.8 to 15,7% decrease for prime—age women.

Female workers as a

whole will also be hurt in comparison with maleworkers.

While male

wages are predicted to increase 8.6 to 12.2%, female wages are
predicted to decrease 7.8 to 10.3%.

Coefficients from a translog production function are used to

older men are

complementary with young men and substitutable with teenage women,
while older women are substitutable with mature men.
The simulation results indicate that wages of prime—age workers

will not deteriorate in relation to older worker's as a result of the
aging of the baby boom cohort.

Conclusions

for teens cannot be drawn.

The general result does not hold for women, however. Prime—age women
are predicted to lose in comparison with older workers and with men,

However CPR P—GO series reports data by age/sex/year for % of full

adjusted to include only 16—19 year olds.
