ABSTRACT
This paper compares fiscal cyclicality across advanced and developing countries, geographic
regions as well as income levels over 1960–2016 period, then identifies factors that explain
countries’ government spending and tax-policy cyclicality. Public debt/tax base ratio provides a
more robust explanation for government-spending cyclicality than public debt/output ratio but the
reverse is true when capital investment is accounted for in government spending. On average, a
more indebted (relative to tax base) government spends more in good times and cuts back
spending indifferently compared with a low-debt country in bad times. We also find that
country’s sovereign wealth fund has a countercyclical effect in our estimation. Finally, the
analysis depicts a significant economic impact of an enduring interest-rate rise on fiscal space,
that is, a 10% increase of public debt/tax base ratio is associated with an upper bound of 5.9%
increase in government-spending procyclicality.

1. Introduction
The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) focused attention on unsustainable leverage growth as a key
contributing factor in growing financial fragility associated with “bubbly” dynamics. Essentially a
prolonged appreciation of financial and real estate markets increases the vulnerability to sharp asset
valuation corrections. A deep enough correction may trigger banking crises and fire sales dynamics,
potentially pushing the economy into a prolonged depression and a growing exposure to social and
political instability.1 Concerns about reliving the 1930s Great Depression explain the complex set of
policies implemented by the U.S. and other affected countries in the aftermath of the GFC: a massive
infusion of liquidity in support of financial and banking systems and bailing out systemic banks and prime
creditors. The forced deleverage of private borrowers, and the growing fear of a prolonged recession,
induced higher household savings and lower investment, further deepening recessionary forces.
To counter these forces, many countries therefore experimented with fiscal stimuli aimed at
mitigating the deepening recessions. Stabilizing the banking and financial systems, in addition to the
stimuli, ended up sharply raising countries’ public debt/GDP ratio, pushing advanced countries towards a
public debt/GDP ratio of above 100%. Similar trends applied to emerging market economies (EMEs),
driving their ratio of public debt to GDP upward, with some reaching well above 50%.2 Notwithstanding
the fact that the average public debt/GDP ratio of EMEs is below that of OECD countries, EMEs’ lower
tax base/GDP ratios, as well as the higher interest rates paid on their debt (due to sovereign risk premia),
imply a rising fragility of EMEs compared with OECD countries. As such, while the ratio of public debt
to GDP is used frequently in policy discussions, the ratio of public debt to tax base accounting for tax
revenue may provide a more informative measure of the fiscal burden associated with the stock of public
debt (Aizenman & Jinjarak, 2011). Henceforth, we refer to this fiscal measure as limited fiscal space.3

See Minsky (1992) for the financial instability hypothesis, which analyzes financial market fragility over the life cycle of
an economy with speculative investment bubbles endogenous to financial markets. Rajan (2006) pointed out that banking
deregulation during the 1980s–2000s increased leverage and risk taking, contributing to a greater exposure to financial stability
associated with tail risks. Schularick and Taylor (2012) and Jordà et al. (2013) provided empirical evidence linking leverage,
business cycles, and crises.
2
Examples of advanced economies facing a public debt/GDP ratio of 100% or above during the recent years include Belgium,
Greece, Italy, Japan, Portugal, and Singapore. For emerging markets, these include: Cabo Verde, Eritrea, Jamaica, St. Kitts and
Nevis, and Lebanon. A high level of debt (either public debt or external debt) is associated with a lower growth, lower
investment, and deteriorating macroeconomic policy environment [see Pattillo et al. (2002), Reinhart et al. (2003), and Reinhart
and Rogoff (2010)].
3
The euro crisis provided a vivid example of how focusing on public debt/GDP below a certain threshold caused a failure to
recognize the large heterogeneity of the tax base/GDP in the Eurozone (Aizenman et al., 2013). Similarly, the interest expense
needed to serve the public debt as a share of tax revenue may provide a robust measure of the burden of serving the public debt
and be more informative than the interest cost of the public debt/GDP ratio.

Importantly, the post-GFC trajectory failed to deal with leverage concerns: “At $164 trillion—
equivalent to 225% of global GDP—global debt continues to hit new record highs almost a decade after
the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Compared with the previous peak in 2009, the world is now 12% of
GDP deeper in debt, reflecting a pickup in both public and nonfinancial private sector debt after a short
hiatus. All income groups have experienced increases in total debt, but, by far, EMEs are in the lead.”
(International Monetary Fund, 2018). In other words, stabilizing a crisis triggered by an unsustainable
leverage growth in turn contributed to a potentially untenable increase in leverage/GDP ratios.
For the past decade, the monetary easing associated with the U.S. Federal Reserve (FED) and the
European Central Bank policies in the aftermath of the GFC led to an unprecedented decline of policy
interest rates and risk premia. These developments markedly reduced the flow costs of serving the rising
public and private debt, thereby masking the increasing fragility associated with the rising aggregate
leverage/GDP. This period has now passed: the (so far) robust recovery of the U.S., the gradual unwinding
of the FED’s balance sheet, the projected upward trajectory of the FED’s funds rate, and the recovery of
the Eurozone will impose growing fiscal challenges that will test countries’ fiscal space and their ability
to cope with projected higher interest rates by raising their resilience.
A key resilience margin is securing fiscal space—the fiscal capacity of countercyclical policy
aimed at mitigating business cycles and preventing a prolonged depression in the aftermath of financial
crises (Auerbach, 2011; Ostry et al., 2010); see also Gavin et al. (1996) on the identification of fiscal
procyclicality as a major amplifier of developing countries’ vulnerability to shocks. Remarkably, over the
last two decades leading to the GFC, a growing share of fiscal policies in developing countries and EMEs
had graduated from procyclicality and become countercyclical (see Frankel (2011) and Frankel et al.
(2013)). Cross-country studies offer several explanations. Woo (2009) presented some evidence showing
that social polarization, as measured by income and educational inequality, is consistently and positively
associated with fiscal procyclicality, controlling for other determinants; there is also a robust negative
impact of fiscal procyclicality on economic growth. Aizenman and Jinjarak (2012) found that higher
income inequality is strongly associated with a lower tax base, lower de facto fiscal space, and higher
sovereign spreads. Végh and Vuletin (2015) find that tax policy is less procyclical (more countercyclical)
in countries with better institutional quality and more financially integrated; tax and spending policies are

2

conducted in a symmetric way over the business cycle. For brevity, Table 1 provides a summary of the
related literature.4
It has been common wisdom that when there is a sharp decline in economic activity of an uncertain
duration, government intervention should take the form of an expansionary fiscal policy. Yet, the viability
of this option hinges upon the degree to which the government has elastic enough access to borrowing. In
the past, this has been the case for most OECD countries, allowing them to contemplate both tax cuts and
fiscal expansions in recessionary times. In contrast, developing countries and emerging markets with a
low tax base and a large public debt burden have a limited fiscal space, facing thereby more complex
trade-offs. Specifically, cutting taxes or increasing government expenditure in recessionary times will
increase the interest rate on their public debt, dampening thereby the stimulus and increasing the cost of
serving the debt overhang. Gaining more fiscal space for heavily indebted countries requires practicing
more countercyclical policies in good times, allowing them to repay more of their debt in expansions,
thereby increasing their fiscal space in recessions.
The rapid increase in public debt/GDP of most OECD countries in recent years suggests that the
old fiscal dichotomy between the fiscal space of the OECD and other countries is blurred by now. This
was vividly illustrated by the growing challenges facing Belgium, Greece, Italy, Iceland and Ireland in
recent years. Thereby, greater countercyclicality in good times may be the key for securing greater fiscal
space in future rescissions. Considering these developments, our paper focuses mostly on the cyclicality
patterns exhibited in recent decades, and the projected challenges associated with possible future interest
rate hikes.
Against this background, we assess definitions and empirical measures of fiscal cyclicality,
compare fiscal cyclicality across Asia, Latin America, the OECD, and other regions, then identify factors
accounting for spending- and tax-policy cyclicality patterns. We link the capacity of countercyclical policy
to the fiscal space and the stage of economic and institutional development, as both are associated with
the servicing capabilities of domestic and foreign debt. Our analysis focuses on differences across the
country groups and examine the role of economic structure (commodity versus manufacturing outputs),
financial openness, as well as institutional and socio-economic factors (political risks, polarization, and

Related strands of the literature examine fiscal multipliers: see Ramey and Zubairy (2018), Leeper et al. (2017), and Ilzetzki
et al. (2013); fiscal rules: see Budina et al. (2012); and large fiscal adjustments: see Alesina et al. (2015). Empirically, fiscal
cyclicality, fiscal multipliers, fiscal rules, and large fiscal adjustments are intertwining issues; their relationships remain an
open question and a challenge to address altogether in one go.

ethnic polarization). The paper concludes with an analysis of possible scenarios and suggested policies
aiming at increasing the resilience of EMEs.
Our study reveals a mixed fiscal scenery, where more than half of the countries are characterized
by limited fiscal space, and fiscal policy is either pro- or acyclical. More limited fiscal capacity, as
measured by the ratio of public debt to 3-years moving-average tax revenue and its volatility are positively
associated with fiscal cyclicality, while those of public debt/GDP are statistically significant in several
cases, suggesting that public debt/tax base ratio provides a robust fiscal-space explanation for studying
government-spending and tax-rate cyclicality.5 We calculate the impact of an enduring interest-rate rise
on fiscal space, rank countries and regions by the fragility of their fiscal space to such an environment,
and discuss policies to increase fiscal resilience. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
reports the empirical analysis with the baseline estimation and robustness checks. Section 3 provides the
conclusion.
2. Empirical analysis
2.1. Fiscal cyclicality: panel estimation
While there is a substantial number of papers trying to estimate the cyclical sensitivity of fiscal
policy in OECD countries and developing ones, either assessing by group or by individual country, the
results are sometimes conflicting.6 In this section, we simply compare cyclical patterns of fiscal
instruments including government spending and tax rates in OECD and non-OECD countries and across
income groups by exploiting as much data availability as possible over 1960–2016 period to estimate the
following panel regression:

where i and t denote country and year, α is a constant term, ɛit is an error term, FISCAL is measured by
either growth rate of real general government final consumption (RGS) or a tax rate, and RGDP is real

Public debt/tax base in public finance is akin the net debt to earnings before interest depreciation and amortization ratio in the
corporate sector (aka Debt/EBITDA). Net debt to earnings ratio is a measurement of leverage, how many years it would take
for a company to pay back its debt if net borrowing is zero, and EBITDA are held constant; used frequently by credit rating
agencies. Ratios higher than 4 or 5 typically set off alarm bells; see S&P Ratings Direct (2013)

gross domestic product (GDP).7 We deflated the nominal government spending and GDP using the GDP
deflator. For the government spending, the estimated 𝛽 is the measure of spending-policy cyclicality: a
positive and statistically significant coefficient indicates fiscal procyclicality; a negative and statistically
significant coefficient indicates fiscal countercyclicality, and a statistically insignificant coefficient
indicates fiscal acyclicality. We also use Végh and Vuletin (2015)’s novel dataset of tax rates including
value-added tax—VAT, personal income tax—PIT, and corporate income tax—CIT. However, the
interpretations of the signs of tax-rate cyclicality coefficient are opposite those of spending-policy
estimates. We leave in panel estimation the potential bias that is likely due to endogeneity and omitted
variables, which will be addressed later in our baseline 2-step model below.
Table 2 shows government-spending cyclicality in the OECD and non-OECD countries with
pooled-Ordinary Least Squares (Pooled-OLS) and Fixed Effects (controlling for country and year effects)
specifications with robust standard errors. During 1960–2016, the non-OECD countries are more
procyclical than the OECD countries, which is in line with Alesina et al. (2008). When it comes to taxrate cyclicality as shown in Table 3, we find fairly consistent results as of Végh and Vuletin (2015) that
OECD countries are fiscally procyclical in VAT, but countercyclical in CIT and PIT; whereas non-OECD
countries are acyclical in VAT and associated with tax procyclicality in CIT and PIT.
As studying with panel data estimation of the cyclical patterns of government spending across
income groups, the results shown in Table 4 come with no surprise as expected by Ilzetzki and Végh
(2008). We find that higher-income countries are least fiscally procyclical, followed by upper-middleincome countries, lower-middle-income countries, and low-income countries.
2.2. Baseline empirical analysis
This section reports the empirical patterns of fiscal cyclicality across geographic regions, the
OECD and non-OECD countries, and different income groups by estimating fiscal cyclicality by country.
We then explore the determinants of countries’ capacities in conducting countercyclical fiscal policy,
focusing on tax base, public debt, economic structure, financial openness, as well as institutional and
socio-economic factors.
Our choice of explanatory variables takes into consideration the factors associated with fiscal
capacity in conducting countercyclical policy—credit constraints, institutional quality, and tax-base
variability (these factors are by no means exhaustive and their inclusion is subject to data availability).
First, the credit constraints. The shape of the supply of funds facing the public sector in recessions is a key

determinant of fiscal space. A flatter supply of funds implies an easier countercyclical policy funded by
borrowing, which in turn is affected by the presence of buffers (international reserves, sovereign wealth
funds), possibly managed by a fiscal rule that allows for more countercyclicality during recessions.
Furthermore, a low external and internal private and public debt-GDP ratios, as well as the ability to
borrow in domestic currency, are associated with greater fiscal space, thereby allowing for cheaper
borrowing in bad times. Second, the quality of institutions. Institutional quality is among the factors that
are associated with fiscal space, which also include default history and inflation, and terms-of-trade
volatility. In particular, the collection efficiency of tax revenue is impacted by the maturity of institutions
and the spectrum of taxes (e.g. VAT and income taxes that are properly enforced). Greater political and
ethnic polarization, inequality, and corruption may reduce a population’s cooperation to pay their “fair
share”, thereby making tax collection harder, increasing country’s sovereign spreads, and leading to lower
fiscal space. Public procyclicality may also be weaker in countries with more progressive taxes and
transfers, as well as more countercyclical infrastructure expenditure, such as the use of infrastructure and
housing investment as a countercyclical policy by the People’s Republic of China. Third, the tax-base
variability. The magnitude of revenue procyclicality depends on production structure. A higher
commodity share in GDP may be associated with greater exposure to the procyclicality of government
revenues. Increased urbanization and international trade are associated with the easier collection of taxes,
implying that tax compliance is higher and may result in tax-revenue procyclicality.
2.2.1. Empirical specification
To estimate the empirical patterns of fiscal-policy cyclicality and its determinants, we start by
using a benchmark framework in the literature; see, for example, Woo (2009). Specifically, we proceed
the empirical analysis in two-step estimation:
Step 1: We run the following time-series regressions to measure the cyclicality of fiscal policy
(spending, tax rates) by country over 1960–2016 period:
𝐹𝐼𝑆𝐶𝐴𝐿 ,

𝛼

𝛽 ∗ ∆𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑅𝐺𝐷𝑃 ,

𝜀, ,

(2)

where FISCAL again reflects either spending side in growth rate of RGS or tax side in VAT, PIT, and CIT
respectively although we crucially aim to explain government-spending cyclicality more than cyclical taxrate behaviour. In the baseline model, we use a standard two-step Prais-Winsten regression to correct for

6

the first-order autocorrelation in the residuals (AR(1)). The cyclical behaviour of government spending
and each tax rate by country is interpreted according to the signs of estimated 𝛽 as in section 2.1.
There is some variation in the estimation of fiscal cyclicality in the literature where output-gap is
commonly used.8 The output gap is the deviation of real output from the potential series by applying
filtering tools, for example Hodrick-Prescott filter, Baxter-King filter, and Kalman filter. However, we
use real GDP growth in baseline estimation as it is unlikely that any of the potential output estimation and
filtering are commonly applicable across countries, though this controversial proxy is employed later in a
robustness check. As a bottom line, we aim for an empirical framework that is straightforward and as easy
to replicate as possible in a cross-country or panel sample. As constructing the sample to begin with timeseries estimation, we replace 33 countries with insufficient data from World Development Indicators by
International Financial Statistics data and keep ones with at least 25 years of observations.
Step 2: We then study the determinants of fiscal (spending, tax rates) cyclicality for the 1960–2016
period by estimating the following cross-country regressions, in which we focus on the measure of limited
fiscal capacity, macroeconomic and socio-economic, as well as institutional variables:
𝛽

where i denotes country, the estimated 𝛽 from the left-hand side are either 𝛽 , 𝛽

respectively which are estimated from equation (2), Xki includes main variables of interest (limited fiscal
capacity, export structure, and country risks), and CONTROLli includes macroeconomic variables,
averaged over 1960–2016 period, including inflation, trade openness, financial openness, government size
(i.e. its consumption share in the GDP), and political constraints. We estimate equation (3) by OLS with
the White robust standard error (RSE).
A brief explanation on our selection of the determinants is needed. To calculate the ratio of public
debt to tax revenue, we use general government tax including social contributions. To capture its second
moments, we also calculate the volatility of limited fiscal capacity, using its standard deviation. As the
size of tax base is persistent in the short- to medium-run, we also add an alternative measure of limited
fiscal capacity, using the ratio of public debt to the 3-years moving-average of tax revenue.9 In the

See Table 1 for some common estimation methods of fiscal-policy cyclicality.
Note that our results are robust to using different time-average for the denominator of the fiscal-capacity variable (for example,
2-years moving average and 5-years moving average of tax revenues). The detailed estimations will be provided upon request.

multidimensional concept, exemplified in several fiscal indicators (International Monetary Fund, 2016).
To account for socio-economic and institutional quality, we use several composite risk indicators,
including financial, economic, and political conditions from International Country Risk Guide. We also

2.2.2. Government-spending cyclicality and its determinants
Table 5 reports the summary of government-spending cyclicality for the 1960–2016 period based
on the country-specific coefficients (𝛽 ).11 Looking across geographic regions, the government-spending
cyclicality of the Sub-Saharan Africa is the highest among the estimates (0.89; most procyclical), followed
by Latin American and the Caribbean (0.77), the Middle East and North Africa (0.69), East Asia and
Pacific (0.46), Europe and Central Asia (0.41), South Asia (0.35), while North America has negative and
the lowest estimate (-0.25; most countercyclical). For OECD and non-OECD countries, the latter group,
on average, is more fiscally procyclical (0.74) than the former one (0.19). Looking across income levels,
the degree of procyclicality is negatively associated with income level, i.e. the low-income countries are
most fiscally procyclical (0.93) followed by lower-middle income countries (0.78), upper-middle income
countries (0.69), and the high-income group (0.32). Overall, the findings from country-specific regressions
are consistent with those in panel estimation.
What might explain the cross-country differences? Table 6 reports the estimation of governmentspending cyclicality coefficients (𝛽 ) on socio-economic and institutional variables over 1960–2016
period. The main findings are as follows. Political constraints (polcon) are negatively associated with
government-spending procyclicality, implying a greater degree of political constraints preventing policy
discretions, which in turn limits fiscal procyclicality. Inflation (inf) is positively associated with fiscal
procyclicality, suggesting the role of macroeconomic instability, seigniorage, and passive monetary
policy. Trade openness (trade) and financial openness (TAL) are negatively associated with fiscal
cyclicality, implying that the countries are less likely to conduct procyclical fiscal policy if they are more
trade and financially open; fiscal multipliers are smaller for more open economies. Government size, as
measured by its consumption share in GDP (gs), is statistically insignificant in explaining fiscal-policy
procyclicality.

More limited fiscal capacity, as measured by public debt/tax base ratio (fiscal, lfiscap) and its
volatility (fiscal_vol, lfiscap_vol) are positively associated with fiscal procyclicality, while public
debt/GDP ratio (debt) and its volatility (debt_vol) are statistically insignificant, suggesting that the ratio
of public debt to tax base provides a robust explanation for government-spending procyclicality for the
1960–2016 period. Manufacturing export share (manu) is negatively associated with while natural
resource export share (nare) is positively associated with fiscal procyclicality. The composite risk and
three component risk indices (economic, financial, and political) as well as eight out of twelve political
component risk indices (including social economic conditions, investment profile, internal conflict,
corruption, military in politics, law and order, ethnic tensions, and bureaucracy quality) are negatively
associated with fiscal procyclicality, thus indicating that higher country risk is associated with higher fiscal
procyclicality.
2.2.3. Tax-rate cyclicality and its determinants
Similarly, only countries with at least 25 years of tax-rate observations are taken, hence we are left
with 35 countries with VAT, 62 countries with PIT, and 62 countries with CIT. However, because of the
infrequent adjustment of tax rates and the non-convergence of the AR(1) coefficient, the estimated
coefficients of some countries cannot be obtained in two-step Prais-Winsten procedure and the sample
size thus becomes smaller.12
After obtaining tax-rate cyclicality coefficients (𝛽

,𝛽

, and 𝛽

), we then regress them on

socio-economic and institutional variables with different sets of controlling variables in each case, using
OLS (RSE) whose results are summarized in the Online Appendix. We find that 𝛽

is negatively

associated with economic and financial risk indices, i.e. VAT becomes more fiscally procyclical as
economic and financial risk decreases. We also find that personal income tax rate is more procyclical with:
more limited fiscal space (lfiscap) and its volatility (fiscal_vol, lfiscap_vol), lower manufacturing export
share (manu), higher socio-economic and political risks (CRI, ERI, FRI, PRI, socecon, inconflict,
exconflict, ethnic, and democracy), and lower institutional quality (corrupt, law, and bureau). The latter
is consistent with the findings of Végh and Vuletin (2015). Among the socio-economics and institutional
variables, only natural resource export share (nare) and religious tensions (religious) are associated with
CIT-cyclicality. Corporate income tax rate becomes more procyclical with higher natural resource export
share and lower religious risks.

2.2.4. Economic significance on fiscal cyclicality
To derive the economic impact of explanatory variables on fiscal cyclicality, we calculate and rank
their economic significance by multiplying their (sample) standard deviation with their estimated
coefficient from corresponding regression, thereby approximating the impact of one standard deviation
change of that explanatory variable on the degree of fiscal cyclicality. For government-spending
cyclicality, Figure 1 shows the economic impact of natural resource export share (positive), limited fiscal
space (positive), socio-economic and institutional risks (negative), and manufacturing export share
(negative). In Figure 2, the economic significance of public/tax base is calculated for each geographic
region. The finding suggests that East Asia & the Pacific and Sub-Saharan Africa are more exposed to the
positive association between fiscal-spending procyclicality and fiscal space than the other regions.
Regarding tax-rate cyclicality, the economic impacts of the explanatory variables on each tax-rate
cyclicality vary considerably. For VAT-cyclicality, most of socio-economic, financial, and institutional
risks have negative and higher economic impacts than limited fiscal capacity whereas natural resource
share has the largest positive economic impact. Nonetheless, the economic impact patterns of these
variables on PIT-cyclicality are quite opposite: limited fiscal capacity (negative and large), natural
resource share (negative), socio-economic and institutional risks (positive), and manufacturing export
share (positive). This may suggest that the cyclicality patterns of VAT differ significantly from those of
PIT. Interestingly for CIT-cyclicality, we find significant effects of the economic significance of
manufacturing export share (positive), limited fiscal capacity (positive), religious tensions (negative and
largest), natural resource share (negative), while the impacts of other institutional variables are mixed and
insignificant.13
2.3. Robustness checks
The fiscal-cyclicality literature suggests that the reduced-form relation between government
spending and output (equation (2)) is the appropriate framework to study fiscal cyclicality and there is “no
strong reason to exclude any equilibrium feedback from fiscal policy to the level of output” (Lane, 2003).
As the reverse causality in equation (2) could result in the endogeneity bias, we addressed this potential
issue below.
We note that the residuals in Prais-Winsten approach are assumed to follow AR(1) process; they
are unobservable. We conduct robustness checks by re-estimating fiscal cyclicality by country in the 1st
step estimation, correcting for heteroscedasticity and serial correlation (up to AR(2)). The estimation is
13

10

done with OLS (RSE) and OLS with Newey-West standard errors. Furthermore, we use the Two-Stage
Least Squares (2SLS) to address potential endogeneity issue of real GDP growth rate in equation (2).
Following the literature, we use global liquidity shock (SHOCKGL) measured as the real return on 6month Treasury bills weighted by countries’ de jure financial openness using Chinn and Ito (2006) index
as an excluded instrument; this variable is a proxy for country’s exposure to global liquidity. In addition,
an external shock captured in the weighted real GDP growth of trading partners (SHOCKJP) and the U.S.
business cycle (KAUS) defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) are also used as
alternative excluded instruments (IVs). The shocks from the U.S. business cycle is also weighted by
countries’ de jure financial openness using Chinn and Ito (2006) index. We check for each country the
relevance and exogeneity of the instruments, and the over-identification tests; subject to data availability,
the validity of these instruments varies across countries. Then we re-estimate the 2nd step on the crosscountry regression where excluding the U.S., using the Weighted Least Squares (WLS) with the weight
being the inverse of standard errors of 𝛽 from the 1st step.
Table 7 summarizes the robustness checks for government-spending cyclicality using instrumental
variables: the results are supportive to the findings in the baseline model. Public debt/tax base ratio and
its volatility are positive and significant in most of specifications but public debt/GDP ratio and its
volatility are less so, suggesting the ratio of public debt to tax base as a more informative variable for
understanding the cyclical government-spending pattern over 1960–2016 period. The impacts of other
variables are consistent with the baseline findings, including natural resource share (positive),
manufacturing export share (negative), socio-economic and institutional risks (negative).
We next look into the choice of the output used in estimating the fiscal cyclicality. The robustness
check on the country-specific government-spending cyclicality is done by regressing the change of real
government spending on the output gap (deviation of real GDP from its Hodrick-Prescott trend); in order
to compare with the baseline model using the real GDP growth. The smoothness parameter is set 6.25 for
the annual data following Ravn and Uhlig (2002). Across the specifications: Prais-Winsten, OLS with
Newey-West standard errors, or 2SLS in the 1st step and WLS in the 2nd step, we find consistent results
with the baseline model. The ratio of public debt to tax base and its volatility are positive and significant
while the ratio of public debt to GDP and its volatility are not, and institutional variables are negative and
significant. 14
Subject to the availability of higher-frequency data (i.e. quarterly), separating cycles from trends would be a useful extension,
especially for the emerging markets. Bashar et al. (2017) disentangles the correlations in cycles from the correlations in slopes

Note that we have so far used the 1st-step estimated coefficients regardless of the statistical
significance; their qualitative and quantitative variations reflect the fiscal countercyclicality,
procyclicality, or acyclicality in the sample. That is, we do not normalize/set them to zero if they are
statistically insignificant in the baseline estimation. This practice is consistent with the existing studies
using the 2-stage estimation, i.e. the average time-series estimates as in Lane (2003) and Woo (2009) or
the x-year rolling window estimates as in Nerlich and Reuter (2015) and Guerguil et al. (2017). However,
to check the robustness of our estimation, we re-do the analysis by setting insignificant estimated 𝛽 to
zero for both Prais-Winsten and OLS estimates; while though some variation is inevitable, we do not find
this change to overturn the main findings in our baseline estimation.15
We note that some of the association between tax-rate cyclicality and the control variables is
sensitive to the choice of econometric specifications; coefficients of several variables are weak statistically
in the cross-country regressions when 2SLS is used in the 1st step. The Online Appendix summarizes the
2nd-step regressions for tax-rate cyclicality under alternative estimations. We find that VAT-cyclicality is
associated with volatility of debt/GDP ratio in several cases (negative), natural resource share (positive),
manufacturing export share (negative), and different institutional risk indices (negative). In contrast, PITcyclicality is shown to be associated with limited fiscal capacity and its volatility (negative), natural
resource share (negative), manufacturing export share (positive), and various socio-economic and political
risks proxies (positive). CIT-cyclicality are associated with natural resource share (negative),
manufacturing export share (positive), and a range of institutional risk indices (positive); when estimated
by the Prais-Winsten specification, it is also negatively associated with religious tensions.
2.4. Fiscal cyclicality at good times and bad times
Recent studies point to the asymmetry of fiscal cyclicality in good times vis-à-vis bad times.
Alesina et al. (2017) use the narrative-identified exogenous fiscal stabilizations (i.e. the stabilization is not
supposed to be correlated with the economic cycle) to show that, for 16 OECD countries, the cuts in
government spending and transfers are much less harmful than tax hikes. Auerbach and Gorodnichenko
(2017) show that for G-7 countries, government-spending shocks do not lead to persistent increases in
debt to GDP ratios or costs of borrowing, especially during periods of economic weakness. While these
lessons from the advanced economies are informative, our study is concerned with both industrial and

of the relevant variables for 11 OECD countries. They find that the growth (slope) of government spending is positively
associated with real GDP in several countries.
15

developing countries. We note that the estimated 𝛽’s so far (from equation (2)) provide the interesting
patterns of government-spending and tax-rate cyclicality; we could delve further by separating the fiscal
reactions in good times from those in bad times. Define good times as the periods with positive real GDP
growth rate and bad times as the periods with negative real GDP growth rate, the regression equation is
as follows:
𝐹𝐼𝑆𝐶𝐴𝐿 ,

𝛼

𝛾 ∗ ∆𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑅𝐺𝐷𝑃 ,

𝜆 ∗𝐷,

𝜃 ∗ Δ𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑅𝐺𝐷𝑃 , ∗ 𝐷 ,

𝑣, ,

where Di,t = 0 if good times (strong economic growth in country i at time t), Di,t = 1 if bad times (weak
economic growth), and θi tests the asymmetric response of government spending in bad times compared
to good times for country i. To obtain Prais-Winsten estimators, we regress the following separately:
D = 0: 𝐹𝐼𝑆𝐶𝐴𝐿 ,
D = 1: 𝐹𝐼𝑆𝐶𝐴𝐿 ,

(4b)

We find that the empirical patterns of fiscal cyclicality (either spending or tax) vary significantly
across specifications (Prais-Winsten and OLS). Essentially, we have a mixed findings of asymmetries in
government-spending cyclicality patterns and the tax-rate policy cyclicality across good times and bad
times.16 When we re-estimate the government-spending estimators on the determinants, we find that the
associations between the government-spending procyclicality 𝛽

and explanatory variables during good

times are largely similar to the baseline model: positive with limited fiscal capacity and its volatility as
well as natural resource share of exports, and negative with manufacturing share of exports and country
risks (see Table 8, columns 1–2). Volatility of public debt/GDP ratio is also positively associated with
government-spending procyclicality in good times. In bad times, the volatility of limited fiscal capacity
and investment profile are statistically significant and negatively associated with government-spending
cyclicality (see column 3). Hence, it seems that in bad times, public debt, tax base, and investment
confidence play a larger role in the government-spending cyclicality. This implies that a more indebted
(relative to tax base) government spends more in good times and cuts back indifferently compared with a
low-debt country in bad times.
Our results so far suggest that, for both government-spending and tax-rate cyclicality, there is no
one-size-fit-all explanation for all (OECD/developing) countries at all (good/bad) times. In essence, fiscal

space, trade and financial openness, the export shares of natural resource and manufacturing, inflation,
and institutional risks are associated with the cross-country patterns of fiscal cyclicality.
2.5. Sovereign wealth funds and government-spending cyclicality
We delve deeper into fiscal behaviour by looking at the role of sovereign wealth funds on
government-spending cyclicality by regressing the following:
𝛽

𝛼

𝛾 ∗ 𝐶𝑂𝑁𝑇𝑅𝑂𝐿

𝜌 ∗ 𝑆𝑊𝐹

, where the dummy SWF = 1 if country has a sovereign wealth fund in operation starting at any point
during 1960–2016 period; SWF = 0 otherwise. Focusing on the fiscal space and institutional risks, we
include their interactions with the SWF variable. We regress equation (5) using the WLS estimation with
real GDP (at 2010 US$) as the weight. Table 9 reports the estimation results for the full sample (1960–
2016) and a sub-sample of good times. The estimates for bad-times are qualitatively similar but
statistically insignificant. The negative coefficients of SWF interactions with public debt/tax ratio and
institutional quality suggest that the existence of sovereign wealth funds has a negative association with
the government-spending procyclicality. Essentially, the findings point to the benefit of investing in
sovereign wealth funds as the countercyclical fiscal buffers in good times to mitigate tax revenue shortfalls
in bad times, thereby increasing the availability of countercyclical spending policy.
2.6. Excluding social contributions from tax base
Tax base has several components, among of which social contributions play an important role to
many countries’ budgets. What would happen if we repeat the estimation using tax base without social
security contributions? However, we do not find much difference in the regression results as well as the
economic significance of each explanatory variables to 𝛽 , 𝛽

,𝛽

, and 𝛽

in the whole sample

period and sub-periods.
2.7. Government-spending cyclicality with capital investment
To further check for the robustness, this section provides the estimation results with alternative
government spending series. We check whether our main findings would hold if the capital investment is
accounted for in the government spending. We re-estimate both the panel estimation and the 2-step crosscountry estimations using World Economic Outlook’s general government total-expenditure; the
government spending is defined as total expense plus the net acquisition of nonfinancial assets for 1980–
2016 period. The net acquisition of nonfinancial assets equals gross fixed capital formation less
consumption of fixed capital plus changes in inventories and transactions in other nonfinancial assets.
14

Using this alternative data set, we find that, overall, the rankings of spending-policy cyclicality across
OECD and non-OECD countries as well as geographic regions and income levels based on both panel and
country-specific time-series estimations are in line with the baseline data set (that is, the government
spending without the capital investment). However, there is some discernible differences, as summarized
in Table 10. Public debt/GDP ratio and its volatility are significantly and positively associated with 𝛽
but public debt/tax base ratio and its volatility are no longer significant except in several cases.
Manufacturing export share remains negatively associated with government-spending procyclicality while
natural resources export share is insignificant in some regressions. Composite risk, economic risk,
government stability, socioeconomic conditions, and law and order indices are consistently and negatively
associated with fiscal procyclicality as in the baseline model, and other proxies for financial risk, political
risk, investment profile, internal conflict, external conflict, corruption, military in politics, ethnic tensions,
and bureaucracy are significant in several estimations.
Our findings on the cyclicality of government spending with the capital expenditure suggest that
it may be useful to look into not only the size but also the composition of government expenditures (i.e.
healthcare, education, defence) to study which components of the spending drive the fiscal cyclicality.
Given heterogeneous population and income inequality, it is quite likely that the composition of
government spending is influenced by trade and financial openness, political economy consideration, the
availability of social safety nets, and fiscal capacity.17
2.8. External debt as an alternative indicator of fiscal constraint
In addition to public debt, external debt has also been studied in the literature as a measure of
countries’ fiscal constraints. A range of empirical studies found non-linear negative effects of external
debt on growth [see Pattillo et al. (2002) and Reinhart and Rogoff (2010)].
We also verify the external debt/GDP as an alternative to the public debt/GDP for measuring and
calculating alternative indicators of fiscal capacity and its volatility. Data on the total external debt is from
World Development Indicators (defined as debt owed to nonresidents repayable in currency, goods, or
services). Total external debt is the sum of public, publicly guaranteed, and private nonguaranteed longterm debt, use of IMF credit, and short-term debt. Short-term debt includes all debt having an original
maturity of one year or less and interest in arrears on long-term debt. Overall, the additional estimation

Shelton (2007) studies the size and composition of government expenditure across countries from 1970–2000. It is likely
that the spending composition is time-varying, especially after the GFC and because of the growing concerns over income
inequality across industrial and developing countries in recent years.
17

15

results do not change our main conclusions. We find that the alternative indicators of fiscal capacity and
fiscal capacity volatility based on the external debt are not significant in the baseline sample (World
Development Indicators data for the 1960-2016 period) but are positively associated with government
spending procyclicality in several estimations using World Economic Outlook data accounting for capital
investment, though these results are not robust across specifications. Regarding the external debt/GDP
ratio and its volatility, most of their coefficients are positively significant in the World Economic Outlook
sample but insignificant in the World Development Indicators sample. That is, as we account for capital
investment, both public debt and external debt are significantly and positively associated with government
expenditure cyclicality. Overall, our results confirm that, in our baseline sample, fiscal capacity and its
volatility measured by public debt/tax revenue are informative in explaining government spending
behaviour, while those measured by external debt/tax revenue are not.
2.9. Determinants of government-spending cyclicality by region
It is clear that the degrees of fiscal cyclicality differ markedly across countries and regions. Given
the differences in the economic development and institutions, it is unlikely that we can come up with a
sweeping explanation, but at least we can try. In order to examine the economic significance of each
explanatory variable on government-spending cyclicality on the regional basis, we repeat the 2nd-step
estimation by region. North America and South Asia are dropped due to insufficient data. Hence, we study
in details five geographic regions: East Asia and the Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and
the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Figure 3 shows the economic
impacts by region, focusing closely on the associations of public debt, export structure, and country risks
with the government-spending cyclicality.
East Asia and the Pacific: limited fiscal capacity has positive and significant impacts while
governance and institutional quality, as measured by most of the country risk indices, have large and
negative effects on fiscal procyclicality. Europe and Central Asia: manufacturing export share and most
of institutional indices have a negative association with government-spending procyclicality; however,
public debt/GDP ratio has a statistically significant and negative association with the governmentspending cyclicality (i.e. lower debt/GDP ratio is associated with more fiscally procyclical). Latin America
and the Caribbean: better institutional quality, more stable politics, smaller share of natural resource
exports, and lower public debt/GDP ratio are associated with lower government-spending procyclicality.
The Middle East and North Africa: somewhat intriguing as good scores on some socio-economic and
political-stability variables are negatively associated with fiscal procyclicality as expected, but democracy
16

risk index is positively associated with fiscal procyclicality. Sub-Saharan African countries: interestingly
there is some evidence of better institutional quality positively associating with procyclicality, yet the
positive association of limited fiscal space and negative association of manufacturing export share with
government-spending procyclicality are the most obvious in this region.
2.10. Fiscal space in a deteriorating macro environment
An enduring rise in the global interest rate will results in increasing the cost of borrowing and
servicing public debt. We now look closely at the economic significance of limited fiscal capacity on
government-spending cyclicality, using the public debt/3-years moving-average tax base ratio, shown in
Figure 4, and calculate to see what would happen if fiscal capacity drops by 10%. It is, specifically,
0.1*(Regional-specific estimated coefficient of public debt/3-years moving-average tax base)*(Actual
average ratio of regional-specific public debt/3-years moving-average tax base over the 1960–2016
period). The top panel in Figure 4 shows the limited fiscal capacity, as measured by the actual ratio of
public debt/3-years moving-average tax base, average over 2010–2016 period. East Asia and the Pacific
and the Middle East and North Africa have on average lower fiscal capacity compared to Latin America
and Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Europe and Central Asia. However, as shown in the bottom panel,
the Sub-Saharan Africa is distinctly fragile fiscally, being exposed to large government-spending
procyclicality if the macroeconomic environment and its fiscal space deteriorate. Based on the calculation,
a 10% increase in public debt/3-years moving-average tax base ratio is associated with an upper bound of
5.9% increase in government-spending procyclicality.
In addition, we look at the economic impact of deteriorating fiscal space, i.e. if a fiscal capacity
drops by 10%, what would happen to the government-spending cyclicality. Specifically, we calculate:
0.1*(Actual average country-specific public debt/tax base)*(Regional-specific estimated coefficient of
public debt/tax base). We use regional-specific coefficient in place of country-specific coefficient as there
is insufficient country-level data to estimate a country-specific 2nd-step regression (i.e., equation (3);
𝛽

= f(public debt/tax base, control variables)). As shown in the upper panel of Figure 5 (using 3-year

tax base; the Online Appendix provides the calculation using 1-year tax base), Iraq, Japan, Singapore,
Greece, Libya, Yemen, Jamaica show limited fiscal capacity based on the 2010–2016 data, accumulating
public debt four to eight times larger than their tax base (Iraq has public debt approximately forty time
higher than its tax revenue). According to the calculation, shown in the lower half of Figure 5, fiscally
fragile countries are mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa (Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Rwanda Seychelles,) and

17

a few cases in East Asia and the Pacific (Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia; and Japan, which is
rather an exceptional case18).

Concluding remarks
Our study reveals a mixed fiscal environment in which more than half of the countries in the study
are characterized by limited fiscal space and fiscal policy is either pro- or acyclical. It confirms that OECD
and higher-income countries are more fiscally countercyclical than non-OECD and lower-income
countries. We also find that, compared to public debt/GDP, the ratio of public debt to tax base is a robust
measure of limited fiscal space and provides a more robust explanation for government-spending
cyclicality but the reverse is true when capital investment is accounted for in government spending.
Moreover, the cyclicality is asymmetric: on average, a more indebted (relative to tax base) government
spends more in good times and cuts back indifferently compared with a low-debt country in bad times.
Lastly, the analysis predicts that a 10% enduring increase of interest-rate is associated with an upper bound
of 5.9% increase in government-spending procyclicality.
Considering the sizable increase in total leverage/GDP in the aftermath of the GFC, countries could
use the global recovery as an opportune time to invest in greater fiscal space, which could be done by
increasing the tax base. Countries could also benefit by investing in countercyclical fiscal buffers,
including the accumulation of sovereign wealth funds in good times to mitigate tax revenue shortfalls in
bad times (e.g., Chile, Norway); indeed, it is shown that countries’ sovereign wealth funds have a
countercyclical effect in our estimation. Likewise, a deeper safety net will add a countercyclical buffer
that mitigates the adverse income effects of recessions, thus reducing income inequalities over time.
A limitation of our study is that, due to data constraints, we focus on the general government and
thereby overlook the contribution of local and state government in a federal union system to cyclicality
patterns. Chances are that controlling for these issues, we would find deeper pro- or acyclical patterns
(e.g., in the U.S., state governments are frequently forced to apply procyclical expenditure patterns, which
means cutting budgets at time of deep and prolonged recessions). Furthermore, while it is widely agreed
that procyclical fiscal policy should be mitigated as much as possible (International Monetary Fund, 2017),
there is no consensus on the practical approach, i.e. which spending components receive priority, and the
fiscal rules to achieve such optimal degree of fiscal cyclicality.

This is partly due to the historically massive distribution and subscription of government bonds through the Yū-cho Ginkō
(less true today) and the preference of Japanese bond holders to the domestic government bonds.
18

18

As different governments face a wide range of political pressures and several targets (i.e. allocation
efficiency, redistribution, debt stabilization, and structural reforms) with various ranking priority, fiscal
challenges are mostly context specific without one-size fitting for all countries at all times. Our crosscountry findings suggest that we need a better understanding on the mixes of (i) components of
government spending, public debt, and tax base; (ii) fiscal policy, monetary policy, socio-economics, and
institutions; and (iii) the role of central banks and quasi-government entities (e.g. sovereign wealth funds,
state-owned enterprises). We study these monetary-fiscal-political economy interactions in our follow-up.

Sample

Key findings

22 OECD
countries
1960–1998

The level of procyclicality varies across spending
categories and countries.
Volatile output and dispersed political power are
associated
with
government
spending
procyclicality.

ρ > 0: procyclicality
ρ < 0: countercyclicality
φ > 0: countercyclicality
φ < 0: procyclicality
ρ > 0: procyclicality
ρ < 0: countercyclicality
φ > 0: countercyclicality
φ < 0: procyclicality

104 countries
1960–2003

Most OECD countries have countercyclical fiscal
policy while most of developing countries have
procyclical fiscal policy.

56 countries
1970–1994

a1it > 0: countercyclical
a1it < 0: procyclical

19 OECD
countries
1961–2005

Fiscal revenues are procyclical in both developing
and industrial countries.
Government consumption in the G7 countries is
acyclical when that in non-G7 industrial countries
and developing countries is procyclical.
Inflation tax rate is countercyclical in industrial
countries and procyclical in developing countries.
The budget deficit has become increasingly
countercyclical in most OECD countries over the
past 20 years. However, this trend has been
significantly less pronounced in the EMU.

βi is interpreted
depending on the fiscal
policy variable

83 countries
1960–2003

Fiscal policy is procyclical in many developing
countries.
Political distortion (i.e. corruption) is positively
correlated with procyclicality of fiscal policy.

βi > 0: procyclicality
βi < 0: countercyclicality

49 countries
1960–2006

Fiscal policy is always procyclical in developing
countries and acyclical/procyclical in highincome countries.

βi > 0: procyclicality
βi < 0: countercyclicality

96 countries
1960–2003

Developing countries are more procyclical than
OECD countries. Latin America is the most
fiscally procyclical region, followed by SubSaharan Africa and East Asian.
Income inequality and educational inequality is
positively associated with fiscal procyclicality.

Taxit = αi + βi * OGit + ɛit (1)
∆Taxrateit = αi + βi *∆ log(RGDPit) +ɛit (2)
Tax: Inflation tax, cyclical component of revenues, and Revenues/GDP
OG: output gap
Taxrate: VAT, PIT, CIT, Tax index
The cyclical series are estimated by the Hodrick-Prescott filter method.
(1): Fixed Effects
(2): Fixed Effects, Instrumental Variables
Δ log(Git) = αit + δit*Δ log(Git-1) + βit*Δ log(Yit) + γit*Xit + εit (1)

X: control variables
(1): Local Gaussian-Weighted OLS

βi is interpreted
depending on the fiscal
policy variable

62 countries
1960–2013

Tax policy is acyclical in industrial countries but
mostly procyclical in developing countries.
Better institutional quality (less corruption and
more bureaucratic quality) and more financially
integration
are
associated
with
less
procyclical/more countercyclical fiscal policy.

βit < 0: countercyclicality
βit > 0: procyclicality

167 countries
1990–2012

Total public spending was countercyclical in both
fiscal-rule countries and non-fiscal rule countries
but the degree of countercyclicality is more
pronounced in the former group.
In contrast, investment spending was procyclical
in both groups and it is more procyclical in the
fiscal-rule countries.

Note:
Model (1): 1st step by Prais-Winsten estimation, 2nd step by Weighted Least Squares estimation (weight is the inverse of standard errors of β in the 1st step).
Model (2): 1st step and 2nd step by OLS estimation with robust standard errors.
Model (3): 1st step by OLS estimation with Newey-West standard errors to correct heteroscedasticity and AR(1) of the residuals, 2nd step by Weighted Least Squares estimation (weight is the inverse of standard errors of β in the 1st step).
Model (4): 1st step by OLS estimation with Newey-West standard errors to correct heteroscedasticity and AR(2) of the residuals, 2nd step by Weighted Least Squares estimation (weight is the inverse of standard errors of β in the 1st step).
Model (5): 1st step by Two-Stage Least Squares estimation (excluded instrument is lag.SHOCKGL), 2nd step by Weighted Least Squares estimation (weight is the inverse of standard errors of β in the 1st step). In the 1st step, there are 48/135
countries having F-partial statistics (1st stage) >= 2; and 122/135 countries having p-value (Durbin test for endogeneity) > 5%.
Model (6): 1st step by Two-Stage Least Squares estimation (excluded instruments are lag6.SHOCKGL and lag5.SHOCKJP), 2nd step by Weighted Least Squares estimation (weight is the inverse of standard errors of β in the 1st step). In the 1st step,
there are 33/124 countries having F-partial statistics (1st stage) >= 2; 117/124 countries having p_value (Durbin test for endogeneity) > 5%; and 122/124 countries having p-value (Sargan test for overidentification) > 5%.
Model (7): 1st step by Two-Stage Least Squares estimation (excluded instrument is lag6.KAUS), 2nd step by Weighted Least Squares estimation (weight is the inverse of standard errors of β in the 1st step). In the 1st step, there are 40/135 countries
having F-partial statistics (1st stage) >= 2; and 119/135 countries having p-value (Durbin test for endogeneity) > 5%.
Model (8): 1st step by Two-Stage Least Squares estimation (excluded instruments are lag.KAUS, lag6.SHOCKGL, and lag5.SHOCKJP), 2nd step by Weighted Least Squares estimation (weight is the inverse of standard errors of β in the 1st step).
In the 1st step, there are 51/130 countries having F-partial statistics (1st stage) >= 2; 122/130 countries having p-value (Durbin test for endogeneity) > 5%; and 124/130 countries having p-value (Sargan test for overidentification) > 5%.
The same set of control variables (polcon, inf, trade, TAL, gs) is used in each cross-country regression. Their estimators are not shown in the table.
Robust standard errors are in parentheses.

Nominal government spending (in millions of local currency).
In the baseline model for the 1960–2016 period, that is general government
final consumption expenditure (formerly general government consumption)
which includes all government current expenditures for purchases of goods
and services (including compensation of employees). It also includes most
expenditures on national defence and security, but excludes government
military expenditures that are part of government capital formation.
In the robust check for the 1980–2016 period, that is general government total
expenditure which is defined as total expense plus the net acquisition of
nonfinancial assets.
Standard value-added tax rate.
Highest marginal personal income tax rate.
Standard corporate tax rate.
The U.S. business cycle shock, defined by NBER, weighted by Chinn and Ito
(2006)’s de jure financial openness by country.
Global liquidity shock, measured by real return on 6-month Treasury bills,
weighted by Chinn and Ito (2006)’s de jure financial openness by country.

The time-series estimated coefficient from regression of value-added tax rate
on real GDP growth rate, 1960–2016.
The time-series estimated coefficient from regression of personal income tax
rate on real GDP growth rate, 1960–2016.
The time-series estimated coefficient from regression of corporate income tax
on real GDP growth rate, 1960–2016.
General government gross debt-to-GDP ratio, average 1960–2016.
Gross debt consists of all liabilities that require payment or payments of
interest and/or principal by the debtor to the creditor at a date or dates in the
future. This includes debt liabilities in the form of SDRs, currency and
deposits, debt securities, loans, insurance, pensions and standardized
guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable.
Standard deviation of general government gross debt-to-GDP ratio, 1960–
2016.
Limited fiscal capacity measured by public debt/tax revenue ratio, average
1960–2016. The denominator refers to the ratio of general government total
tax revenue including social contributions to GDP (ICTD/UNU-WIDER).
Volatility of limited fiscal capacity measured by standard deviation of public
debt/tax revenue ratio, 1960–2016.
Limited fiscal capacity measured by public debt/3-year moving-average tax
revenue, average 1960–2016.
Volatility of limited fiscal capacity measured by standard deviation of public
debt/3-year moving-average tax revenue, 1960–2016.
The extent of political constraints faced by executives in implementing policy,
average 1960–2016, ranging 0–1 point, higher value indicates greater political
constraints.

trade

The ratio of total exports and imports to GDP, average 1960–2016.

inf

Inflation, average 1960–2016.

nare
manu
TAL

The ratio of natural resources in export (including agricultural raw materials,
ores and metals, fuel, and food) in total exports, average 1960–2016.
The ratio of manufactured export (including chemicals, basic manufactures,
machinery and transport equipment, and miscellaneous manufactured goods,
excluding non-ferrous metals) in total exports, average 1960–2016.
The ratio of total foreign assets and liabilities to GDP to measure de facto
financial integration, average 1970–2011.

Note:
Model (1): 1st step by Prais-Winsten estimation, 2nd step by OLS estimation with robust standard errors.
Model (2): 1st step and 2nd step by OLS estimation with robust standard errors.
Model (3): 1st step by Prais-Winsten estimation, 2nd step by Weighted Least Squares estimation (weight is the inverse of standard errors of β in the 1st step).
Model (4): 1st step by OLS estimation with Newey-West standard errors to correct heteroscedasticity and AR(1) of the residuals, 2nd step by Weighted Least Squares estimation (weight is the inverse of standard errors of β in the 1st step).
Model (5): 1st step by OLS estimation with Newey-West standard errors to correct heteroscedasticity and AR(2) of the residuals, 2nd step by Weighted Least Squares estimation (weight is the inverse of standard errors of β in the 1st step).
Different sets of control variables (among polcon, inf, trade, TAL, gs) are used in each model. Their estimators are not shown in the table. Robust standard errors are in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Note: β is estimated in equation (2) by country using Prais-Winsten approach to correct for the first order-autocorrelation in the residuals. The countries are grouped according to World
Bank regions.

Figure A3. Economic significance of public debt/(1-year tax base) to government-spending cyclicality by country.
Note: β by country is estimated from equation (2) using Prais-Winsten approach.
EAS: East Asia & Pacific; ECS: Europe & Central Asia; LCN: Latin America & Caribbean; MEA: Middle East & North Africa; SSF: Sub-Saharan Africa.The countries are grouped according to
World Bank regions. The upper half shows the public debt/(1-year tax base) ratio. The lower half shows the economic impact of deteriorating fiscal space, i.e. if a fiscal capacity drops by 10%, what
would happen to the government-spending cyclicality. Specifically, we calculate: 0.1*(Actual average country-specific public debt/(1-year tax base))*(Regional-specific estimated coefficient of
public debt/(1-year tax base)). We use regional-specific coefficient in place of country-specific coefficient as there is insufficient country-level data to estimate a country-specific 2nd-step regression
(i.e., equation (3); 𝛽 = f(public debt/(1-year tax base), control variables)).
