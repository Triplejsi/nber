Medicare Payment to Skilled Nursing Facilities: The Consequences of the Three-Day Rule
Ginger Zhe Jin, Ajin Lee, and Susan Feng Lu
NBER Working Paper No. 25017
September 2018
JEL No. D8,H51,I13,I18
ABSTRACT
Medicare does not pay for a skilled nursing facility (SNF) unless a fee-for-service patient has
stayed in the hospital for at least three days. Discharges after the three-day cutoff consistently
result in more transfers to SNFs. Using the three-day rule as an instrument, we find that SNF
discharges decrease hospital readmission for patients with comorbidities. However, for knee and
hip replacement patients, we find significant increases in readmission. This perverse effect is
more severe when local SNFs have lower quality. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that
the three-day rule may have generated extra Medicare payments to SNFs by $100-447 million per
year.

1. Introduction
Medicare is the largest single purchaser of personal health care in the US. The total
Medicare spending has nearly doubled in the last decade, with 22% devoted to fee-forservice (FFS) inpatient care and 9.5% to FFS post-acute care (MEDPAC 2017). Facing
an aging population, 1 Medicare spending is projected (by CBO) to reach $1 trillion in
2021, and the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which helps to pay for FFS
inpatient and post-acute care, is projected to be insolvent by 2028. These alarming
predictions call for a better understanding of potential wastes and savings in the Medicare
system.
To answer this call, we focus on a specific reimbursement rule that Medicare
imposes on the intersection between inpatient and post-acute care: Medicare does not pay
for the fee-for-service (FFS) care provided in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) unless the
patient has stayed in the hospital for at least three days. This rule applies by number of
midnights that a patient stays in a hospital, not the number of hours. For example, a
patient admitted at 10 pm on day 1 and discharged 9 am on day 4 satisfies this condition,
but a patient admitted at 9 am on day 1 but discharged 10 pm on day 3 is not qualified.
We study the effect of the three-day rule in a framework of difference-indifferences (DID). In particular, we compare regular Medicare patients (65-79) with nonMedicare patients (60-79), and focus on the patients that are initially discharged from a
hospital within 24 hours before or after the three-day cutoff. After a long list of controls, 2
we examine how the three-day rule affects Medicare patients’ discharge to SNFs and the
subsequent hospital readmission rate within 30 or 60 days.
Using 2.9 million hospital inpatient discharge records from four states (20042013), we find that Medicare patients discharged 0-24 hours after the three-day-cutoff are
6.8 percentage points more likely to be discharged to a SNF than those discharged 0-24
hours before the cutoff. This effect is enormous, considering the fact that only 9.4% of
Medicare patients (and 8% of all patients) in our sample were discharged to SNFs. When
we use the three-day Medicare rule as an instrumental variable (IV) for SNF discharge,

SNF discharge is found to have a negative effect on 30- or 60-day hospital readmission
rate in the whole sample, but this beneficial impact is entirely driven by sicker patients
with an above-median Elixhauser Comorbidity Index. 3 If we focus on patients with no or
fewer comorbidities, the IV results find no significant readmission difference between
those discharged to SNFs and those discharged anywhere else.
To better understand these results, we develop a conceptual framework that
incorporates both the hospital’s discharge decision and the potential differences across
SNFs. In addition to the three-day payment rule, Medicare also calculates payment to a
SNF based on the patient’s need for labor-intensive and non-labor services inside a SNF
(CMS 2017a). Though the Medicare payment strives to reflect wage and other costs
across geographic areas, it does not differ by SNF quality within the same geographic
area (conditional on the same patient). As a result, even if a hospital has decided to
discharge the patient to a SNF, every patient prefers higher quality SNFs and the costplus structure of Medicare payment may motivate SNFs to prefer patients that need more
high-margin services. These settings imply further sorting across SNFs, with less
profitable patients – for example, the healthier ones that cannot justify a lot of care or
those that require many low-margin services – to be more exposed to the capacity
constraint of high quality SNFs. Together, the conceptual framework predicts that (1) the
three-day rule is likely to affect the relatively healthy patients that are on the margin of
going to SNF or going home, (2) relative to staying home, adverse health outcomes are
more likely to occur in low-quality SNFs that have capacity to admit the marginal
patients, and (3) the financial burden on Medicare can come from overtreatment, adverse
health outcomes, or both.
Consistently, we find the effect of the three-day rule on SNF discharge is the
largest (14 percentage points) for knee and hip replacement (KHR), a major health
condition that on average has much lower hospital readmission rate and much lower
Elixhauser Comorbidity Index than heart disease, stroke and other conditions.
Furthermore, among these four categories, KHR is the only one for which we find a
significant increase in hospital readmission rate as a result of the three-day rule. This
3

We compute Elixhauser Comorbidity Index according to Elixhauser et al. (1998) and the corresponding
software developed by AHRQ (https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/comorbidity/comorbidity.jsp).

perverse effect is larger in the health service areas (HSAs) where the average SNFs have
a lower-than-state-median occupancy rate or a higher-than-state-median total deficiency
count. These findings suggest that many KHR patients go to SNF simply because
Medicare will pay for it and there is a bed available in nearby low-quality SNFs.
Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that the three-day Medicare rule has
the potential to generate significant overuse of SNF services. Pooling all conditions and
projecting from our sample to the whole Medicare system, we estimate that the three-day
rule may have generated an extra Medicare payment to SNFs of $100-447 million per
year, without a significant reduction in hospital readmissions. The range reflects whether
we focus on patients with no comorbidity at all or patients with a below-median
Elixhauser Comorbidity Index. They correspond to 0.32-1.43% of Medicare’s annual
payment to SNFs as of 2016. For KHR only, the three-day rule is estimated to cost
Medicare $83.7 million per year, including payment to SNFs and the subsequent increase
in hospital readmission. This number corresponds to 1.2% of Medicare’s annual payment
for KHR as of 2014.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the Medicare
payment rules and reviews the related literature. Section 3 presents a simple analytical
framework for the potential effects of the three-day rule on hospital readmission. Section
4 describes our data. Section 5 defines our main econometric specification and presents
empirical results. Section 6 concludes with back-of-the-envelope calculations for the
potential implication of our analysis for Medicare spending.

2. Background and Literature
The US healthcare expenditure continues to grow rapidly. By 2016, it has
exceeded $3 trillion per year, contributing to 16.9% of the GDP. By 2030, one in every
five US residents will be 65 years or older due to the aging of the baby boomer
generation. Moreover, the composition of the elderly population will change with
increase in the population over 85 years, as people live longer. In the face of an aging
population and rising costs, the US healthcare system is in transition from volume-based
reimbursement models (e.g., fee-for-service) to value-based reimbursement models (e.g.,
prospective payment system or bundled payment). How to contain costs and improve

4

health outcomes via reimbursement reforms is an important and urgent issue for the US
healthcare system.

2.1 Medicare’s three-day rule for skilled nursing care
Medicare’s three-day rule requires a patient to spend at least three consecutive
days in hospital inpatient care in order to qualify for the Medicare-covered discharge to a
SNF for post-acute care. This rule dates back to 1965 when inpatient hospital stays
dominated healthcare. The original intention of the rule was to give doctors enough time
to evaluate the severity of a patient’s health condition, screen out healthier patients, and
cover patients who need skilled nursing care. Another intention of the rule is to
discourage hospitals from quickly discharging patients without careful observation and
admitting new patients just for the sake of providing another billable service.
Since 1998, SNF services are no longer paid on a volume-determined rate, but
rather on the basis of a prospective payment system (PPS). The PPS payment rates are
case-mix adjusted and cover all costs of furnishing covered SNF services, where the costs
are calculated according to labor and non-labor costs by geographic areas. Beginning in
the summer of 2009, several states implemented a pay-for-performance reimbursement
policy, which intended to reward SNFs that provide good quality services. However, SNF
quality changed little after the policy and the results on cost savings are mixed (Werner et
al. 2011, Arling et al., 2013 and Grabowski et al. 2017). Because it is hard to measure
quality and establish a clear link between effort, performance and rewards, qualityadjusted reimbursement is not widely adopted. Furthermore, rewarding health care
providers based on their quality performance may give them perverse incentives to
cherry-pick healthier patients and shun sicker ones. This explains why the current
Medicare payment to SNFs is adjusted by patient risk and local cost but not by SNF
quality.

2.2 SNF Operations
SNFs mainly serve three types of patients based on their insurance type.
According to the Nursing Home Compare, 60% of SNF care is paid by Medicaid, 20% by
Medicare, and the rest by private insurers or patients themselves. Medicare residents

5

generate the highest revenue per resident per day (~$500), while Medicaid residents
generate the lowest revenue per resident per day (under $194). 4 High revenue does not
necessarily imply high profit margin, because the cost of delivering the services that bear
a higher CMS reimbursement rate may also be high. However, CMS adjusts the
reimbursement rate according to local labor and non-labor cost across regions, and thus
we believe revenue and margin are positively correlated. Moreover, SNFs do not
independently evaluate patient need for SNF care when they admit patients from
hospitals. Rather, they rely on the patient’s hospital discharge record, including
diagnosis, treatment, inpatient stay, demographics, insurance type, etc. Once a patient is
admitted, the SNF determines the category of services the patient needs and the therapy
minutes in that category. Bowblis and Brunt (2014) show that SNFs upcode patients by
providing additional therapy minutes to increase revenue, but do not upcode related to
patient functionality scores. Above all, SNFs usually prefer Medicare and privately
insured patients to Medicaid patients. As shown by Nyman (1993), non-Medicaid
patients typically gain admission first when there are not enough beds. According to a
New York Times article in 2015, the entire industry is chasing those lucrative consumers
while quality of care is said to lag. 5
To assure quality of care, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
launched the Nursing Home Quality Initiative in 2002 and initiated the Five Star Quality
Rating System (FSQRS) in 2008. These quality disclosure policies motivated SNFs to
improve quality at least along the reported dimensions (Lu, 2012, 2016; Huang and Hirth,
2016; Zhao, 2016; Brickley et al, 2018). It is noteworthy that the FSQRS is constructed
mainly using deficiency citations. The CMS weights deficiency citations more than other
quality measures in calculating star ratings since they are produced by government
inspections, as opposed to self-reports (CMS 2017c). Moreover, the count of deficiency
citations is also widely used as a proxy of SNF quality in the literature (e.g. Harrington et
al, 2000; Lu and Wedig, 2013).

On average, a SNF has 104 beds. 6 Due to the Certificate of Need Law, SNFs are
not allowed to change their bed size without approval from state authority. According to
the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission’s 2015 report to the Congress, the average
length of stay for a Medicare resident in a SNF is 37 days (MedPAC 2015, p. 200). There
exist severe excess demand issues from Medicaid patients (Ching et al, 2015). Therefore,
the utilization of SNF beds is very high with an overall occupancy rate of 88.8%.
Because most patients do not pay for SNF care themselves, they all prefer high
quality SNFs to low quality SNFs. In addition, due to the state certificate of need laws, it
is difficult for nursing homes to expand capacity. Naturally, SNFs with high occupancy
rates usually provide good quality. A recent study by Hackman and Pohl (2018) shows
that SNFs tend to discharge Medicaid patients in order to admit lucrative patients when
occupancy rates increase. These lucrative patients tend to demand high quality services,
which give SNFs an incentive to promote quality. In the annual OSCAR data of SNF
characteristics (to be described in Section 4), we find a negative correlation between
occupancy rates and deficiency citations (-0.147).

2.3 Literature Review
Our study contributes to a broad literature on the impact of Medicare
reimbursement rules on healthcare spending and outcomes. Finkelstein (2007) shows that
the introduction of Medicare in 1965 increased healthcare spending six times more than
what was predicted. However, the fee-for-service payment adopted by Medicare at that
time had no discernable impact on elderly mortality (Finkelstein and McKnight 2008).
Duggan and Morton (2010) find that the introduction of Medicare Part D significantly
reduces out-of-pocket prices and results in a substantial increase in utilization of
Medicare-intensive drugs. Brown et al. (2014) show that the risk adjustment in the
Medicare Advantage (MA) program significantly lowers healthcare costs conditional on
patients’ health risk. Duggan et al. (2016, 2017) and Curto et al. (2017) investigate the
impact of MA and find that health spending is lower for enrollees in MA than in the
traditional Medicare, but it has no association with any measurable reduction in hospital
quality or patient mortality. In this study, we investigate Medicare’s three-day

7

reimbursement rule on SNF discharge and the subsequent hospital readmission. We find
that the three-day rule increases the likelihood of discharging Medicare patients to SNFs,
which increases healthcare spending but does not necessarily reduce readmission rates.
Most relevant to our study is a small but growing literature on the impact of
reimbursement rules on coordination care. Grebla et al. (2015) study the three-day rule
within Medicare Advantage (MA) patients. Unlike Medicare FFS patients, MA patients
may or may not be subject to the three-day rule depending on their MA plan. By
comparing hospital discharges in the MA plans with and without the three-day rule,
Grebla et al. (2015) find that eliminating the three-day rule may reduce the hospital
length of stay (before discharge to SNF) by 0.7 days. But this reduction is from an
average of more than 6 inpatient days, which is way over the key margin of discharging a
patient on day 2 or day 3. Our study focuses on this particular margin, and includes all
discharge outcomes after an inpatient stay, not just the discharge to SNFs. Unfortunately,
only two of the four states in our data distinguish MA from Medicare FFS, and none of
them spell out the identity of the MA plan or whether the MA plan adopts the three-day
rule or not. For these reasons, we keep all Medicare patients as one group in the
empirical analysis. Later on, we show that our results are robust if we exclude MA
patients from the sample in Session 5.4.1.
More broadly on coordination care, Gornick and Hall (1988) document the trend
in Medicare use of post-hospital care. Grabowski (2007) points out that Medicare and
Medicaid provide conflicting incentives for long-term care. Meyers et al. (2018) shows
that MA patients are more likely to enter lower-quality nursing homes compared to FFS
enrollees. Recent research by Einav et al. (2017) investigates the effect of a payment
“jump” on the timing of discharge and mortality in long-term acute-care hospitals
(LTCHs). They find that the share of LTCH stays increases significantly at the precise
day of the jump. However, the timing of discharge does not have significant effects on
patient mortality. By contrast, Eliason et al. (2017) find that the gaming of discharge
timing leads to worse outcomes for patients in LTCHs. Doyle et al. (2017) explore a
random assignment of patients by ambulance companies to hospitals. They find that lack
of productivity in post-acute care could be a possible reason for the waste in healthcare.

8

We directly test whether SNF care in fact produces substantial waste in healthcare using
the three-day rule as an instrument for SNF discharges.
Navathe et al. (2017) examine the impact of Medicare’s bundled payments in joint
replacement. They find that the implementation of bundled payment significantly reduced
Medicare payment and almost half of the savings come from less spending in post-acute
care. Our study tackles the impact of the three-day rule on SNF discharge, including
patients with knee or hip replacement (KHR). We find a significant increase in hospital
readmission rate for KHR patients as a result of the three-day rule. This perverse effect is
larger in the HSAs where the average SNFs have a lower-than-state-median occupancy
rate or a higher-than-state-median total deficiency count. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study that examines the impact of the Medicare three-day rule on SNF
discharge and hospital readmission, and quantifies this impact in Medicare overspending.

3. Conceptual Framework
The key question is how the three-day cutoff could create deviations from
efficient allocation of health care. We propose a simple conceptual framework to address
this question.
Suppose Medicare is a social planner aiming to maximize patient utility of health
care minus post-acute care cost. Denote the net value as V(x|s)=U(x|s)-C(x), where x is
the type and amount of post-acute care (hospital, SNF, home) and s is patient sickness
before treatment. Obviously, patients may differ in many dimensions beyond sickness.
For model simplicity, we summarize all patient heterogeneity in the single parameter of s,
and assume a monotonic relationship between s and the need for health care. In empirical
analysis, we will control for an extensive list of patient characteristics. If we normalize
V(home|s)=0 for every s, then V(hospital|s) represents the net utility of receiving
inpatient care with initial condition s and V(SNF|s) represents the net utility of receiving
care from SNF with initial condition s, all relative to staying home.
As shown in Figure 1, we further assume both V(hospital|s) and V(SNF|s) are
positively sloped, i.e. the value of receiving either care is higher when the patient is
sicker. And V(hospital|s) is more steeply sloped than V(SNF|s), so that the sicker the
patient is, the more utility she will derive from inpatient care than from SNF care. The

9

intercept of each line is determined by the difference between patient utility and cost of
the corresponding care. Inpatient care is the most expensive while staying home is the
least among the three types of post-acute care. When the patient is sick enough, inpatient
and SNF care are both better than staying home. However, when the patient is healthy
enough, V(hospital|s) and V(SNF|s) can be negative, implying that it is better (for the
social planner) that the patient stays home rather than consume costly care from a
hospital or SNF. When patient sickness is somewhere in the middle, it is possible that
V(SNF|s)>V(hospital|s)>V(home|s).
In short, Figure 1 shows a monotonic sorting where patients with s>s 1 should be
hospitalized, s 2 <s<s 1 should go to SNF, and s<s 2 should stay home. To the extent that
patient sickness is observable (to Medicare and hospital) and the hospital is a perfect
agent of Medicare, the hospital should keep s>s 1 inpatient, discharge s 2 <s<s 1 to a SNF,
and send s<s 2 home. In reality, patient sickness is observable to the hospital but not
observable to Medicare. Given the non-trivial agency problem between Medicare and the
hospital, Medicare proxies the true patient sickness at hospital discharge by an observable
variable such as length of inpatient stay.
To the extent that the three-day rule is an imperfect proxy for patient sickness, it
can make two errors: first, those with s 2 <s<s 1 (who should go to a SNF in the ideal
world) does not satisfy the three-day rule, and they end up going home instead of to SNF.
This is suboptimal because patients suffer from inadequate care at home although
Medicare saves money. This error is denoted by a green diamond in Figure 1. Second,
those with s<s 2 (who should go home in the ideal world) satisfy the three-day rule, and
the patient may prefer unnecessary SNF care because the care is free. This is a typical
moral hazard problem, which wastes money for Medicare, as the cost that Medicare pays
to the SNF is more than the utility that the patient receives from the SNF (relative to
home). The second error is denoted by a blue circle in Figure 1. To ease future
discussion, we refer to the two types of errors as Error 1 (resulting in insufficient care)
and Error 2 (driven by moral hazard).
So far, we take the timing and sickness at discharge as given. In reality, both are
under the control of the hospital, and the hospital’s discharge decision could be distorted
by the three-day rule. One may concern whether this will mitigate or exacerbate the

10

above two errors. Let us consider Error 1 first: those with s 2 <s<s 1 cannot go to SNFs
because they have not stayed long enough in the hospital. If the hospital is not capacity
constrained, allowing the patient to stay longer in the hospital could generate revenue to
the hospital 7 and help the patient to receive the optimal care (SNF) at discharge. This
inducement behavior moves the error from the green diamond to the red triangle, which
wastes Medicare money in inpatient care. If the hospital is so capacity constrained that it
cannot keep the patient in the hospital in order to satisfy the three-day rule, the error stays
in the green diamond and the cost is the same as before – the patient is discharged home
and suffers from inadequate care after discharge. This could generate worse patient
outcomes (such as hospital readmission) in the future. As for Error 2, patients with s<s 2
prefer SNF care because it is free. If the hospital is more of an agent for the patient than
for Medicare, the patient will be discharged to SNF, generating unnecessary expenditure
for Medicare as illustrated in the blue circle. Since we assume SNF care is better than
home (before accounting for the cost), this suboptimal discharge to SNFs should only
affect patient outcomes positively, if it has an effect at all.
Now let us add a third layer of complication. Suppose some SNF services are of
high quality, and some are of low quality. For illustration, assume all SNFs in Figure 1
are high quality. Figure 2 repeats Figure 1, but adds a line below and parallel to the line
of V(SNF). Now the two parallel lines represent high and low quality SNFs (SNF high and
SNF low ) respectively. The cost of these two types of SNFs is the same in the eyes of
Medicare, because Medicare pays the same rate regardless SNF quality. For simplicity,
we assume the actual cost of care is also the same for all SNFs and all health conditions. 8
By definition, V(SNF high )>V(SNF low ). If SNF high has no capacity constraint, SNF low does
not matter at all because it is always dominated by SNF high . In that case we go back to
Figure 1.
But in a world where the capacity constraint of SNF high becomes binding at s c
(s 2 <s c <s 1 ), Medicare would prefer a sorting such that s>s 1 stay inpatient, s c <s<s 1 go to
SNF high , s’ 2 <s<s c go to SNF low , and s<s’ 2 go home. Note that the new cutoff for going

7

Whether this will generate more revenue for the hospital depends on whether Medicare pays the hospital
by procedure (DRG) or by length of stay.
8
Under this assumption, high revenue implies high profit margin. Because sicker patients need more units
of care, sicker patients bring in more revenue and more profits.

11

home, s’ 2 , is higher than s 2 , because it is determined by V(SNF low ) rather than
V(SNF high ). In other words, because of low quality SNF services, Medicare would prefer
to send more patients home, as a social planner.
The three-day rule of Medicare is independent of SNF quality. If the rule attempts
to proxy s 2 in Figure 1, it fails to adjust for the existence of low quality SNFs. This alone
will generate a new error as more patients should go home rather than go to SNF low . We
denote this new error caused by low quality SNF care as Error 3, in a yellow pentagon in
Figure 2. The presence of low quality SNFs also exacerbates the value loss from the
overuse of SNF (as denoted in the blue circle), because the overuse occurs in low quality
SNFs rather than high quality SNFs. If the quality of SNF low is so low that the patient
may suffer more from SNF low than staying home (say higher infection rate), it could
increase the risk of adverse patient outcomes. The three types of errors, and their
distortion on the health care system, are summarized in Table 1.
In addition to the information and incentive challenges facing Medicare, the
presence of SNF high and SNF low also creates an incentive wedge between patients and
SNFs. Because we assume SNF high provides better quality care (at the same cost) than
SNF low , every patient prefers SNF high to SNF low. However, Medicare commits to a higher
SNF reimbursement rate for a sicker patient (to the extent that the sickness is observable).
Under the (oversimplified) assumption that the cost of SNF care is the same for all SNFs
and all conditions, SNF high is incentivized to accept sicker patients first before it hits the
capacity constraint. Bowblis and Brunt (2014) shows that nursing homes prefer patients
with more therapy minutes. Since sicker patients tend to require more therapy minutes
conditional on the diagnosis, it is reasonable to assume that profit-seeking nursing homes
may have incentives to admit sicker patients. The same financial incentive exists for
SNF low , but there may be enough SNFs in some market so that SNF low never hits its
capacity constraint. In that world, SNF high will admit sick patients until it is full, whereas
SNF low accepts all the remaining patients for whom Medicare is willing to pay for SNF
care. Such sorting across SNFs with different quality levels is also aligned with patient
selection behavior that severe patients are more likely to seek for high quality SNFs for
treatment.
The SNF admission priority by patient sickness is in the same order as the sorting

12

by net value in Figure 2. However, it implies that, when the capacity constraint of
SNF high is binding at s c and the three-day rule is a local proxy for s 2 ’<s<s c , those that
suffer most from the low quality of SNF low will be the relatively healthy patients that
should have gone home but end up discharged to SNF low (the yellow pentagon and blue
circle).
Overall, we have three predictions:
Prediction 1: The three-day rule may generate extra Medicare expenditure
because of overtreatment at SNFs, late discharge at hospitals and adverse health
outcomes. All of them tend to focus on relatively healthy patients who are on the margin
of a wrongful discharge decision.
Prediction 2: Adverse health outcomes such as hospital readmission will
disproportionally affect the relatively healthy patients, because of either over-treatment in
low quality SNFs or under-treatment at home. Which one dominates depends on the
quality difference between SNFs and home care.
Prediction 3: If we have a good measure of SNF quality, adverse outcomes
(conditional on being discharged to SNFs) should be disproportionally concentrated in
low quality SNFs. If we do not have a good measure of SNF quality, SNF occupancy rate
might be an indirect measure. In that case, adverse outcomes (conditional on being
discharged to SNFs) should be disproportionally concentrated in SNFs with a low
occupancy rate.

4. Data Summary
We use three databases. The main one is the inpatient discharge data from
Arizona (2004-2007), Florida (2005-2013), New York (2005-2013), and Washington
(2004-2013) State Inpatient Databases (SID) of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization
Project (HCUP). 9 These datasets contain all inpatient records and thus capture all
Medicare patients who have qualifying hospital stays for SNF coverage in our sample
states and years. The data also contains important information such as the primary
expected payer, length of stay, and discharge destination. In addition, the data provides

13

encrypted person identifiers, which allow us to track readmissions of the same individual
over time.
We merge the SID with the American Hospital Association’s (AHA) Annual
Survey of Hospitals, 10 which provides additional information about the hospitals in our
sample, such as hospital location and facilities.
The third database is the 2003-2013 Online Survey Certificate and Reporting
Database (OSCAR), which includes all Medicare and Medicaid certified nursing homes
operating in the US. This database provides nursing home characteristics such as facility
locations, deficiency citations and occupancy rate. Since OSCAR is collected at the SNFyear level, we cannot link it to the SID data at the individual patient level. To address this
shortcoming, we use the discharge hospital’s health service area (HSA) to match with the
average deficiency count and occupancy rate of SNFs in that HSA. 11
Total deficiency count is a well-known measure of SNF service quality (Castle
and Ferguson 2010). If the SNFs in a HSA have on average a higher number of
deficiency citations 12 than the median of the corresponding state in the preceding year,
we classify the HSA as above-median deficiency. Similarly, if the SNFs in a HSA have
on average a lower occupancy rate than the median of the corresponding state in the year
preceding the admission year, we classify the HSA as below-median occupancy. We use
predetermined values of deficiency and occupancy to address potential endogeneity
between these quality measures and patients’ actual discharge destination.
We restrict our main analysis sample to patients with age between 60 and 79 who
are discharged within 24 hours before and after the three-day cutoff.

13

We also focus on

new episodes of hospitalization, where an episode is new if the patient has not been
hospitalized in the past 180 days. This way, readmissions following a new episode are not
included in the sample, but they are used to construct the 30-day and 60-day readmission
outcomes for that episode. We drop observations missing the key variables such as

We drop SNFs with 100% Medicaid patients in computing the average deficiency and occupancy rate
since these SNFs focus on long-term care instead of post-acute care.
12
We right-censor deficiency citations at top 1 percentile to exclude outliers.
13 We extend the age range from 65-79 to 60-79 by including some young non-Medicare patients mainly
because there are few non-Medicare patients above 65. In the robustness checks (section 5.4), we shorten
the age range and the results remain robust.

discharge destination, primary expected payer, encrypted person identifiers, and average
SNF quality at the HSA level. We also exclude patients whose initial visit ended with
death and thus cannot be tracked over time.
Table 2 presents the share of patients discharged to various destinations, by
whether their hospital discharge is above or below the three-day cutoff and whether their
insurer is Medicare or non-Medicare. Home discharges are more common for patients
discharged on the second day than those discharged on the third day. Non-Medicare
patients are more likely to be discharged home than Medicare patients. In contrast,
discharges to SNF are more common for discharges on the third day, especially for
Medicare patients. Home health care (HHC) is also more common for those who are
discharged on the third day, and the share is higher for Medicare patients.
Table 3 compares patient demographics, health conditions, and readmission rates
by discharge destination (home or HHC vs. SNF), above/below threshold, and
Medicare/non-Medicare. For patients who are discharged to SNF, Panel B also compares
SNF characteristics by above/below threshold and Medicare/non-Medicare.
Unsurprisingly, Medicare patients are older, more likely to have heart disease, stroke, and
various comorbidities. Readmission rates are also higher for Medicare patients than nonMedicare patients. Knee or hip replacement is more common for non-Medicare patients,
and patients with knee or hip replacement are much more likely to be discharged on the
third day.
Patients discharged to SNFs are generally older than those discharged home or
HHC. More than 50% of the patients discharged to SNFs on the third day had knee or hip
replacement. Patients discharged on the second day to SNFs are more likely to have
comorbidities and are more likely to be readmitted than patients discharged home.
However, patients discharged on the third day to SNFs are relatively similar to those
discharged home in terms of the probability of having comorbidities and readmission
rates. Among patients discharged to SNFs on the third day, Medicare patients tend to stay
in HSAs with slightly higher deficiency citations and slightly lower occupancy rates.
Table 4 shows SNF discharge rates and readmission rates by health condition,
above/below the cutoff, and Medicare/non-Medicare. The SNF discharge rates are the
highest for Medicare patients discharged on the third day for all health conditions. This

15

pattern is most pronounced for knee or hip replacement (KHR) patients. The 30-day
readmission rates are the highest for patients with heart disease (9.1-13.7%), followed by
other conditions (7.4-10.3%), stroke (6.5-9%), and knee or hip replacement (2.4-4%).
The same order holds for the 60-day readmission rate. Consistently, KHR patients have
the lowest Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, no matter whether we compute the Index in
readmission score or mortality score. These patterns suggest that KHR patients are
healthier than patients with heart disease, stroke and other conditions. Therefore,
according to our conceptual framework, they should be more on the margin of
discharging to SNFs versus home and more exposed to the capacity constraint of high
quality SNFs.

5. Empirical Analysis
We examine the effects of the three-day rule in a difference-in-differences (DID)
framework. Specifically, we first examine discharge destinations of Medicare patients
(65-79) and non-Medicare patients (60-79), comparing patients who are discharged from
a hospital within 24 hours before vs. after the three-day cutoff:
Y i = δ Day3 i *Medicare i + α 1 Day3 i + α 2 Medicare i + X i + e i

(1)

where i denotes a patient. Day3 i is an indicator for discharges within 24 hours after the
three-day cutoff. Medicare i is an indicator for patients with Medicare as the primary
expected payer. Day3 i *Medicare i is the interaction between the two variables. X i is a
vector of discharge characteristics including patients' demographics such as age, age
squared, an indicator for sex, a series of indicators for race, health conditions (Diagnosis
Related Group (DRG) fixed effects and indicators for all comorbidities 14), as well as
hospital fixed effects. We also control for discharge year and discharge month fixed
effects. Moreover, to account for different discharge probabilities throughout the day, we

The list of comorbidities is: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) comorbidity measure
for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, alcohol abuse, deficiency anemias, rheumatoid
arthritis/collagen vascular diseases, chronic blood loss anemia, congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary
disease, coagulopathy, depression, diabetes (uncomplicated), diabetes with chronic complications, drug
abuse, hypertension, hypothyroidism, liver disease, lymphoma, fluid and electrolyte disorders, metastatic
cancer, other neurological disorders, obesity, paralysis, peripheral vascular disorders, psychoses,
pulmonary circulation disorders, renal failure, solid tumor without metastasis, peptic ulcer disease
excluding bleeding, valvular disease, weight loss.

16

include a dummy for each discharge hour as well as a dummy for missing discharge hour.
We report robust standard errors clustered at the HSA level.
The key coefficient of interest is δ, which captures the difference between day 3
and day 2 discharges among Medicare patients relative to the difference among nonMedicare patients conditional on patient demographics, health conditions, seasonality,
and discharge hour. We consider the probability of discharges to four different
destinations as an outcome Y i : home or home health care (HHC), SNFs, other facilities
(including another short-term hospital and a long-term care hospital), and discharge
against medical advice (AMA).
We are ultimately interested in examining the effects of SNF discharges on
readmission rates.
R i = β SNF i + α 1 Day3 i + α 2 Medicare i + X i + e i

(2)

where R i denotes whether the patient is readmitted to a hospital. We consider readmission
within 30 days as well as 60 days. The estimate β will be biased upwards if a discharge
SNF is correlated with (unobserved) sickness. We instrument SNF i with
Day3 i *Medicare i to estimate the causal effect of SNF discharge on readmission rates
using a two stage least squared (2SLS) method. The 2SLS estimate β describes the local
average treatment effect for compliers, i.e. patients who are induced to be discharged to a
SNF due to the three-day rule.
The key identification assumption is that all control variables – including hospital
fixed effects, patient attributes, major diagnosis, comorbidities, day 3 alone and insurance
type alone – are sufficient to capture observable and unobservable health conditions that
may affect a hospital’s discharge decision. As the result, the interaction of
day3*Medicare mainly captures the financial incentive of discharging Medicare patients
to different destinations. This assumption will be tested by robustness checks in Section
5.4.
We prefer DID to the alternative approach of regression discontinuity (RD),
mostly because only a small percent of hospitalization is around the midnight cutoff.
Around 90% of patients are discharged from the hospital between 10 am and 6 pm, with
the most at 2 pm (13.2%). In Section 5.4, we show that the impact of the three-day rule
on discharge to SNF is robust when we zoom in 5 hours before and 5 hours after the

17

midnight cutoff. However, this window only accounts for 3% of our main sample, and
patients discharged in this window are systematically different from other patients in
health conditions and local SNF characteristics. Also, because discharge to SNF requires
paperwork between hospital and SNF, such paperwork is unlikely to occur around the
midnight, which explains why the probability of discharge to SNF in this time window
(3%) is much lower than the overall probability of SNF discharge (8%). We worry that
severe sample selection could potentially bias the estimation of the overall impact of SNF
discharge on hospital readmission.
Including all new hospitalization episodes that are discharged 24 hours before and
after the midnight cutoff alleviates the selection problem, but it also make our
identification rely more on the comparability between Medicare and non-Medicare
patients in this relatively large time window. In Section 5.4, we show that our results are
robust if we narrow the age range from 60-79 to 62-67, and the differential effects we
observe between Medicare and non-Medicare patients only occur around the three-day
cutoff, not around the cutoff on day 4, day 5, day 6 and day 7.

5.1. Results in the pooled sample
We first estimate the effect of the three-day rule on discharge destinations. Table
5 reports δ from equation (1) for each of the four different discharge destinations.
Medicare patients who are discharged after the three-day cutoff are 6.8 percentage points
more likely to be discharged to a SNF than those who are discharged before the three-day
cutoff. This effect is enormous, considering the fact that only 9.4% of Medicare patients
(and 8% of all patients) in our sample were discharged to SNFs. The increase in
discharge rate to SNFs is offset by a decrease in home and home health care discharges.
Subsequently, we estimate the effect of a SNF discharge on readmission rates
using both OLS and 2SLS approaches. Table 6 summarizes the results. Columns 1 and 2
of Panel A show that patients who are discharged to SNF have higher readmission rates,
if we use simple OLS. If patients with more severe conditions tend to be discharged to
SNF, the unobserved differences in sickness may bias the OLS estimates upwards. Panel
B shows that once we instrument the SNF discharge with Day3*Medicare, the estimates
on 60-day readmission rates become negative and statistically significant. This suggests

18

that holding health conditions constant, SNF care may be more beneficial than home care
in terms of reducing hospital readmissions.
We unveil the negative readmission effects further by patient comorbidity.
Columns 3 and 4 show that for patients without any comorbidity (12% of the sample),
SNF discharge has no effect on readmission rates. Patients with at least one comorbidity
drive the negative readmission effects (Columns 5 and 6 in Table 6). If we split the full
sample by whether a patient has above- or below-median Elixhauser Comorbidity Index,
the significant, negative readmission effects only persist in the above-median subsample
for 60-day readmission. In the below-median subsample, discharge to SNF has no
significant effect on readmission (Columns 7 and 8 in Table 6). This suggests that SNF
service is only effective in reducing hospital readmission for sicker patients.

5.2. Results by health conditions
We further examine the effects of the three-day rule and SNF discharges by health
conditions. We separately consider heart disease, stroke, and knee or hip replacement
since they are common conditions that may benefit from post-acute care at a SNF
(MEDPAC 2010). Other conditions are grouped as the fourth category.
As shown in Table 7, the discharge effect of the three-day rule is the largest for
knee or hip replacement. Medicare patients with knee or hip replacement discharged after
the three-day cutoff are 14 percentage points more likely to be discharged to a SNF than
those who are discharged before the three-day cutoff. This increase in SNF discharges is
entirely offset by a decrease in home or HHC discharges. The discharge effect is the
smallest for heart disease patients with a 1.8 percentage point increase. The increase in
SNF discharges is also offset by a reduction in home discharges for heart disease, stroke,
and other conditions. In short, finding the largest SNF discharge effect in KHR patients is
consistent with Prediction 1, because KHR patients are healthier than other patients and
therefore more on the margin of being discharged to SNFs or going home.
Table 8 presents OLS estimates on readmission rates by health conditions. Given
the large discharge effect for KHR patients, we separately examine knee and hip
replacement and pool the other conditions. The OLS estimates show that the positive
coefficient of SNF discharge on readmission rates is lower for KHR patients than for all

19

other conditions. This is not surprising because KHR patients have the lowest
readmission rates in the raw data.
Table 9 shows the corresponding 2SLS estimates. When we instrument SNF
discharge with the three-day rule, we find a significant increase in readmission rates for
KHR patients. We generally do not find a significant effect on readmission for other
conditions. Within knee and hip replacement, the perverse effect of SNF discharge on
readmission is larger for KHR patients without comorbidity. This pattern is consistent
with Prediction 2, where we argue that healthier patients are more exposed to low quality
SNF services because they are closer to the margin of a wrongful discharge decision.

5.3. Results by local SNF characteristics
We further break down the sample by local SNF characteristics, using deficiency
citation and occupancy rate. Panel A of Table 10 shows that the increase in readmission
rates for Medicare KHR patients is driven by low occupancy HSAs. Panel B shows that
the increase in readmission rates is higher and only significant in high deficiency areas,
consistent with the fact that areas with high deficiency are often areas with low
occupancy. Consistent with Prediction 3, these results suggest that KHR patients are
relatively healthy and on the margin of going to SNF simply because Medicare will pay
for it and there is a bed available in nearby low-quality SNFs. Not only does the overconsumption of SNF care increase post-acute care expenditure for Medicare, but it also
generates a higher readmission rate, which requires even more spending from Medicare.
We will quantify these costs for Medicare when we conduct our back-of-the-envelope
calculation in Section 6.

5.4. Robustness checks
5.4.1. Alternative sampling
One key identification question is whether Medicare and non-Medicare patients
are truly comparable. They obviously differ in age as Medicare patients are 65 and above
but most non-Medicare patients are 60-65, with only a small fraction spreading above 65.
We have controlled for a polynomial function of age in all regressions, but one still
wonders whether our results could be driven by Medicare patients being systematically

20

sicker than non-Medicare patients, rather than the three-day rule of Medicare.
To consider this possibility, we employ an event study approach to examine pretrends, by the exact discharge hour. That is, instead of Day3*Medicare in equation (1),
we include a series of interactions between Medicare and each discharge hour within the
24 hour window before and after the three-day cutoff. Panel (a) of Appendix Figure A.1
shows that there is little evidence of pre-trends between Medicare and non-Medicare
patients, while the SNF discharge rate increases significantly 10-24 hours after the threeday cutoff. Similar results hold for the subsample of KHR patients only (panel (b) of
Appendix Figure A.1), though the parallel shift of SNF discharge rate after the cutoff is
less powerful for this subsample.
We then plot the same graph for the hypothetical cutoff at midnight of day 4, day
5, day 6 and day 7. If Medicare patients are systematically sicker than non-Medicare
patients, we should observe the effects at these hypothetical cutoffs similar to the threeday cutoff. As shown in Appendix Figure A.2, the difference between Medicare and nonMedicare patients is mostly muted for day 4, day 5, day 6 and day 7.
Appendix Table B.1 runs the same regressions as our main results for these
alternative cutoffs. Thanks to our enormous sample, the probability of discharge to SNFs
is significantly different between Medicare and non-Medicare patients for day 4, day 5,
day 6 and day 7, but the magnitude of this difference is much smaller than for the day 3
cutoff (-0.7 to 1.1 percentage points as compared to 6.8 percentage points). These results
suggest that the Medicare-versus-non-Medicare difference is much more salient for the
day 3 cutoff, likely because of the three-day rule of Medicare.
Another way to ensure comparability between Medicare and non-Medicare
patients is adopting a narrower age range. Tables B.2-B.5 repeat the same regressions as
our main results but use the age range 60-69 instead of 60-79. Tables B.6-B.9 further
narrow the age range to 62-67. In both scenarios, the estimated impact of the three-day
rule on SNF discharge is smaller (5 and 4.4 instead of 6.8 percentage points) but remains
significant at 99% confidence. In the second stage, we still observe a contrast between
KHR and other conditions, where KHR patients suffer from a higher readmission rate
because of the three-day rule but other patients have either similar or significantly lower
readmission rate after staying at a SNF. The perverse readmission outcome for KHR

21

patients continues to concentrate in the HSAs with a higher-than-state-median total
deficiency count or a lower-than-state-median occupancy rate.
Similar robustness is achieved when we expand the sample to include all
hospitalization episodes instead of new episodes only (Appendix Tables B.10-B.13); drop
MA patients (Appendix Tables B.14-B.17); or reduce the sample to 12 hours (instead of
24 hours) before and after the three-day cutoff (Appendix Tables B.18-B.21). Moreover,
when we use a regression discontinuity (RD) design focusing on Medicare patients
discharged between 5 hours before and after the three-day cutoff, we still find a robust
increase in SNF discharge rates above the threshold (Appendix Table B.22).

5.4.2 Selection on patient condition
We also investigate whether selection of patient condition can explain our results.
In our main estimations, we already control for all observable differences in patient
condition using the DRG fixed effects and indicators for comorbidities. Alternatively, we
examine each comorbidity as an outcome using equation (1) (without the comorbidity
controls) and find that 15 out of 29 comorbidities have significant difference between
Medicare patients who are discharged after vs. before the three-day cutoff relative to nonMedicare patients. We drop patients with these 15 comorbidities so that the remaining
sample does not have any comorbidity difference across the threshold on average. For
this subsample, we find similar lift in the probability of discharge to SNFs (Appendix
Table B.23), and either zero or negative impact of SNF stay on readmission rates for the
full sample (Appendix Table B.24). However, we still find significant, positive
readmission effects for KHR patients, which are larger for KHR patients without
comorbidities and stronger in low occupancy HSAs (Appendix Tables B.25-B.26).
In Appendix B.27-B.30, we examine whether our estimates are robust to an
additional set of controls. Patients who intend to take advantage of the three-day rule may
differ in their method of admission, admission time, or the total hours in the hospital. We
find that our estimates barely change when we include admission time, total hours in the
hospital, and whether the initial hospital admission was through the emergency room
(ER). Similar results arise when we further restrict the sample to ER admissions only
(Appendix B.31-B.32). Such robustness suggests that patients are unlikely to manipulate

22

their stay in the hospital due to the three-day rule.
To further test the validity of our instrument, we include Day3*Medicare in the
OLS equation (2). In theory, this addition should not have a significant impact on
readmission outcomes because the OLS regression already includes the endogenous
variable, the SNF discharge. Appendix Table B.33 shows that the coefficients on SNF are
almost identical to our main OLS estimations in Panel A of Table 6, although the
coefficients on Day3*Medicare are statistically significant in the full sample as well as
the subsample with any comorbidity. For the subsample without any comorbidity – where
we find no readmission effects of SNF discharge due to the three-day rule – we find that
adding Day3*Medicare to the OLS has no significant effect on readmission rates. This
highlights our findings that SNF care may not improve health outcomes for patients with
less severe conditions.

5.4.2. Hospital Bed Availability
We also concern that hospitals could manipulate the length of stay of Medicare
patients for SNF coverage. Though Medicare is unlikely to pay for extra length of stay
(because Medicare pays by DRG), the doctor may “help” a Medicare patient to stay
longer in order to qualify for the SNF coverage. Such “help” is more feasible when the
hospital beds are underutilized. Accordingly, we define hospital bed availability as
months in which total inpatient days are below the median in a given hospital-year.
Appendix Table B.34 shows that the likelihood of discharging Medicare patients to SNFs
after the three-day cutoff is 5.2 percentage point more than before the cutoff for hospitals
with different levels of bed utilization. Since the discharge effect varies little by hospital
bed availability, we believe that hospitals are very unlikely to manipulate the length of
stay for SNF coverage.

6. Conclusion and Policy Implications
Overall, we find alarming signs that suggest unnecessary Medicare spending and
adverse health outcomes, all related to the three-day rule that Medicare imposes on its
FFS reimbursement to SNFs.

23

More specifically, in the pooled sample, the three-day rule leads to a 6.8
percentage point increase in the probability of discharging a Medicare patient to SNFs
within 24 hours after the three-day-cutoff. This effect is enormous, considering the fact
that only 9.4% of Medicare patients (and 8% of all patients) in our sample were
discharged to SNFs. However, among those that have no comorbidity or below-median
Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, there is no significant readmission difference between
those discharged to SNF and those discharged somewhere else.
More than 50% of the patients discharged to SNFs on the third day had knee or
hip replacement (KHR). For KHR patients alone, the three-day rule increases the
probability of SNF discharge by 14 percentage points. Though KHR patients are on
average healthier than patients with heart disease, stroke and other conditions, KHR is the
only category for which we find a significant increase in hospital readmission rate as a
result of the three-day rule. This perverse effect is larger and only significant in the
HSAs, where the average SNFs have a lower-than-state-median occupancy rate or a
higher-than-state-median total deficiency count. This suggests that many KHR patients
are discharged to SNFs simply because Medicare will pay for it and there is bed available
in nearby SNFs. Unfortunately, discharging KHR patients to SNF is associated with a
greater likelihood of hospital readmission within 30 and 60 days.
What do these findings imply for Medicare expenditure? Table 11 presents two
sets of back-of-the-envelope calculations, one for the pooled sample, and one for knee
and hip replacement only. On the pooled sample, we focus on the patients with no or
below-median comorbidities because, within these patients, SNF discharge makes no
difference in hospital readmission. Thus, Medicare expenditure on their SNF discharge
could be unnecessary. Assuming Medicare pays $500 a day for FFS care in SNFs and an
average Medicare patient stays in a SNF for 37 days per episode (Lu, Rui and Seidmann
2018), a 6.6 percentage point 15 increase in the probability of SNF discharge implies an
extra payment of $139.6 million in our sample. Translating it into the annual spending of
the whole Medicare, it amounts to $99.74 million per year if we only count patients with

15

We use 6.6 percentage points instead of 6.8, because the former is the estimated effect of the three-day
rule on the probability of SNF discharge for patients with no comorbidities, while the latter is the effect for
all patients (Table 5).

24

no comorbidities, or $446.86 million per year if we include patients with below-median
comorbidities. These numbers correspond to 0.32 to 1.43% of total Medicare payment to
SNFs. 16
Turning to knee and hip replacement only, we focus on two sources of
unnecessary Medicare expenditure. The first one is Medicare payment for SNF discharge,
and the second one is Medicare payment for the increased hospital readmission after the
SNF discharge. For both of them, we focus on KHR patients with no complications,
which accounts for 97.4% of the KHR patients in our sample. 17
Assuming an average KHR patient discharged to a SNF will stay there for 15 days
(DeJong et al. 2009) and Medicare pays $500 per day, a 14 percentage point increase in
SNF discharge implies an extra Medicare payment of $223.2 million in our sample.
Projecting it to the whole Medicare population, it implies unnecessary Medicare payment
to SNFs by $112.5 million per year. To calculate Medicare payment for the extra
readmission after the SNF discharge, we assume each readmission entails $10,000 per
visit. 18 That implies $6 million in Medicare spending for our analysis sample, or $4.24
million per year for the whole Medicare population. In combination, the two sources of
unnecessary spending add up to $83.73 million per year for Medicare, which accounts for
1.2% of the total Medicare expenditure on knee and hip replacement. 19
These back-of-the-envelope calculations may be conservative, because we do not
include the potential longer stay in hospital in order to qualify for the SNF discharge

16

According to CMS (2017b) Table III.6, total Medicare payment to SNFs was $31.332 billion in fiscal
year 2016.
17
We use procedure codes in the inpatient record to determine whether a KHR patient receives the joint
replacement procedure with or without complications. Literature has shown that institutionalized post-acute
care can be helpful for KHR patients with complications (McLawhorn and Buller 2017). Because KHR
patients with complications often stay in the hospital longer than three days, our analysis sample has very
few of them.
18
Based on CMS data (https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-andReports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Inpatient2015.html), the least expensive DRG at readmission for
KHR is DRG 946 (Rehabilitation without CC/MCC) with an average payment of $10,951 in 2014. We
assume $10,000 per readmission to be conservative.
19
According to CMS (https://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/cjr, accessed May 16, 2018), there were more
than 400,000 knee and hip replacement procedures in 2014, costing more than $7 billion for the
hospitalizations alone. We use $7 billion to proxy for the total Medicare expenditure on knee and hip
replacement.

25

under the three-day rule. It is difficult to quantify this element, as we do not find strong
evidence supporting hospital manipulation in length of stay (Appendix Table B.34).
Our findings are consistent with the perceived inefficiency in the Medicare
system, which has motivated a number of alternative payment methods. In 2012, CMS
experimented with the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement (BPCI) on a voluntary
basis. Subsequently in 2016, CMS mandated the Comprehensive Care for Joint
Replacement (CJR) reimbursement model in 67 MSAs. In both programs, Medicare
commits to a bundled payment to a participating hospital, where the bundle covers
inpatient, outpatient and post-acute care related to a particular procedure. In its extreme
form, the participating hospital may receive a fixed amount for the whole knee and hip
replacement episode, regardless how much care the patient actually receives from
inpatient stay, SNF usage, rehabilitation center, or home care up to 90 days since the
beginning of the procedure.
As summarized by McLawhorn and Buller (2017), early evidence suggests that
bundled payments are able to reduce Medicare cost for the whole KHR episode, without
reducing quality of care for most KHR patients. For example, Navathe et al. (2017) study
3,942 KHR patients in the Baptist Health System (BHS), a network of 5 hospitals in San
Antonio, Texas. BHS adopted BPCI in October 2013, where the bundled payment covers
acute hospitalization and 30 days of post-acute care. Between July 2008 and June 2015,
average Medicare expenditure per KHR episode declined 20.8%. In the meantime,
readmissions, emergency department visits, and length of inpatient stay all declined.
While some of the overall hospital savings came from internal cost reduction, average
post-acute care spending declined 27% per case. Most of the post-acute savings were
driven by reductions in inpatient rehabilitation and SNF spending, and these savings only
occurred when the bundle payment included financial responsibility for post-acute care.
While these results may be specific to BHS, they confirm the conclusion that
traditional fee-for-service payment includes unnecessary waste. As shown in our study,
the three-day payment rule has encouraged relatively healthy patients to overuse SNFs
but stay in SNF does not improve hospital readmission rates. In some cases – such as
knee and hip replacement – the overuse of SNFs is also related to higher readmission,
leading to even more Medicare spending. Our findings suggest that discharge to SNFs

26

should be based on a more complete assessment of patient conditions including the
existence and severity of comorbidities rather than a single measure of length of stay in
hospitals.
Finally, we caution readers that our back-of-the-envelope calculations focus on
Medicare spending, not the total welfare. We lack individual records and cost data from
SNFs, and do not consider the possibility that admission of Medicare patients may crowd
out Medicaid and private-insured patients from capacity-constrained SNFs. Nor do we
observe the cost of care provided by family members when a patient is discharged home

Notes: Each cell shows an estimate from a different regression. Panel A shows the OLS estimates from a regression of
30- or 60-day readmission rate on SNF discharges, controlling for an indicator for Day 3, an indicator for Medicare as
well as a vector of discharge characteristics such as patients’ age, age squared, an indicator for sex, a series of indicators
for race, health conditions (Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) fixed effects and indicators for all comorbidities), hospital
fixed effects, discharge year and discharge month fixed effects, discharge hour fixed effects, and a dummy for missing

Notes: We drop patients with comorbidities that have a significant difference between Medicare patients who are
discharged after versus before the three-day cutoff relative to non-Medicare patients and repeat the 2SLS estimations
by local SNF characteristics for knee and hip replacement patients. In addition to the indicator for discharge to SNF
instrumented with Day 3*Medicare, each regression includes an indicator for Day 3, an indicator for Medicare as well
as a vector of discharge characteristics such as patients’ age, age squared, an indicator for sex, a series of indicators for
race, health conditions (Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) fixed effects and indicators for all comorbidities), hospital
fixed effects, discharge year and discharge month fixed effects, discharge hour fixed effects, and a dummy for missing
discharge hour. Standard errors are clustered at the HSA level.
