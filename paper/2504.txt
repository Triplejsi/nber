The Political Economy of Controls: American Sugar

Anne 0. Krueger*

In economic theory, it is relatively straightforward to analyze the impact
of politically-imposed controls over economic activity. Whether the control is
over feedgrain prices in Egypt, the quantities of imports of individual iteimns

in India, price controls over "old" oil, or the "voluntary" reduction in the
number of automobiles exported from Japan to the United States, several con-

clusions follow straightforwardly. First and foremost, those controls (and
most others) at best achieve their objectives in a a more costly manner than
would alternative mechanisms. Second, the presumed beneficiaries of controls

are often quite different from those (if any) actually benefitting. Third, the

costs of controls seem to be largely ignored or misunderstood in political
decision— making, at least in the first instance.
Despite these well-established results, controls seem to persist. A major
challenge confronting those concerned with these costs is therefore to attempt

to understand the reasons why the politial process often generates and perpetuates high—cost solutions to stated objectives. To establish an understanding of the political economy of controls would therefore appear to be a formi-

dable, but important, challenge, if means are to be sought to attain political
objectives

through least—cost means.

Ian Little has been in the forefront among professional economists using

their analytical tool

of

kit

to

demonstrate the costs of controls in a variety

settings. His work has been instrumental in convincing the vast majority of

the

economics profession that the economic costs of controls are far greater

than was generally thought two or three decades ago. lt is therefore appropriate that an essay in his honor attempt to further understanding of the
political economy of economic policy. To that end, this paper sets forth the
various hypotheses that are implicitly or explicitly made by economists about

the determinants of controls and regulations. It then subjects those
hypotheses to scrutiny by examining how well they perform in explaining the

political

economy of one particualar set of controls, those pertaining to

American sugar.

To

that end, Section 1 contains a brief survey of the literature pertaining

to the political mechanisms generating controls. The next several sections
cover the essentials governing the production and distribution of sugar (Sect.
2),

the origins of the Americtn sugar Program (Section 3), and its evolution

over the period from 1948 to 1987 (Sections 4 through 6). Section 7 then
provides a critical examination of the evolution of the program from the view-

point of the various hypotheses laid out in Section 1. A final section
provides some tentative conclusions.

Sect. 1. Models of Econonic Policy Formulation

in the various subfields in economics. In international trade, the tradition
was for long to assume that policy makers were uninformed and that failure to

adopt Pareto-optimal policies reflected ignorance on their part. International
economists assumed that a benevolent government would, once informed of the

benefits of free trade, immediately undertake policy reform. Considerable bewilderment then resulted from the many departures from Pareto—optimal policies

in circumstances where infant-industry and monopoly power in trade did not
apply.

literature. In this section, I focus

only on the economics literature on the subject, in part because of my own
comparative advantage, but in part because the intent of the paper is to focus
on political—economic interactions, and the role of market forces in affecting

the outcomes of policies adopted by politicians, topics largely neglected in

in which lobbyists spend resources

in seeking legislation equal in value to the value of the protection to them.

In public economics, there has been a similar tradition: a presentation of
economic efficiency conditions for optimality, with the accompanying assertion

that nonfulfillment of these conditions — such as the presence of externalities -

represented a case of market

failure and therefore

justified market

intervention. Underlying these sets of policy prescriptions is the notion once

again

of government as a benevolent guardian, hampered only by ignorance of

proper

economic policy as it seeks disinterestedly in maximizing Benthamite

social

welfare.

In the field of industrial organization, by contrast, the tradition until
the

l960s

public

was to assume that government bureaucrats were in fact pursuing the

interest

in regulating whatever was regulated — transport, communica-

tions, public utilities, and

the like. This view was challenged, and largely

in the 1970s by Stigler, Peltzman, and others, who instead posited

full rationality of all actors. In this view, all political agents are rational

view

and use the political process

to effect wealth transfers. Thus, the

of the regulatory process chnnged fundamentally, as it was seen as a ra-

tional outcome to private maximization through the political process. All par-

ticipants were seen to be fully rational and acting in their own self inter-

est. In

this model, policy analysis by economists would serve no useful pur-

pose, as additional information would not change the behavior of any

par-

tic ipant in the regulatory process.
An interesting variant on the Stigler-Peltzman approach has been set forth

by Becker, who assumes that political interest groups fona in their own self

interest, and that politicians rationally choose policies in response to the
4

competing pressures these groups can exert. With competition among groups, and

the assumption that anything

which

benefits one group

must

either be financed

by a tax or indirectly by costing another group (including deadweight losses), Becker concludes that the resources are allocated to the
directly

political

process to maximize the benefits (which are for some

groups

nega-

tive) each group expects to receive.
Yet another approach is that of Nancur Olson. Starting with the "logic of

collective action", in which the "free rider" problem prevents the effective
collusion of large groups of small losers, Olson formulated hypotheses as to
which groups would emerge and the characteristics of industries and of other

economic interest groups that would be likely to be effective. Carrying his

analysis further, Olson attempted to explain differentials in growth rates
among nations after the Second World War. In Olson's world, interest grups or-

ganize to protect their interests as growth progresses. Over time, more and
more groups and institutions are in place, and in the process economic efficienoy diminishes and growth decelerates. War destroys these groups and in-

terests, at least to some extent, so that war-devastated countries, such as
Germany and Japan are enabled to grow rapidly, freed of many of the resistances to growth that arise over time in a war-free environment.2
Olson's model

essentially posits that economically—inefficient outcomes

arise because of free rider problems: it is rational for individuals not to
join groups interested in consumer welfare, etc., because the benefits to them

not been subject to empirical testing. Yet empirical evidence with regard to

political economy of controls.

2. The Sugar Market

The eonomic effects of the American sugar program have been extensively

analyzed, and are reasonably well known. In this section, the essential
characteristics of the sugar industry, and the relation of the American market
to the international sugar market are described. Emphasis is on those aspects

relevant for analyzing the political economy of controls, at least as exemplified in the case of sugar.
2.1. The Production Function3

Sugar is an unusual commodity. It can be made from either raw cane or

sugarbeets, and yet the end products of the two are perfect substitutes. Cane
can grow only in tropical or semi-tropical climates while sugarbeets are grown

in temperate climates. Both cane and beets require processing to make sugar.

3. This section draws heavily on Landell Mille (1985). The interested reader
can consult that source for considerably greater detail. The facts, however,
are in virtually all hearings pertaining to the sugar program.
7

In both cases, initial processing must be undertaken within a very short time

after harvest; it must therefore be done close to where the cane or beet is
grown.

beet sugar, a single stage refining process has Produced refined sugar

For

since the

late 1800s. In the case of cane, however, second stage refining is

nececssary

to make refined sugar; raw sugar (i.e., that processed from cane

near the site) can be refined anywhere.4 While there are a few byproducts of

cane and of beet, they are not sufficiently valuable to warrant growing the
crops in the absence of a demand for their sugar; at any event, the byproducts
made from cane and beet are similar.

Cane and beet mills, and cane refineries are capital intensive, and apparently have little or no alternative use. No farmer would consider growing
cane or sugarbeet without a processing plant nearby, and no processor (of raw
cane and of sugarbeet — cane refining is different) would consider estab-

lishing a

plant unless there were a proximate source of supply. For this

reason, there is a considerable degree of vertical integration in the in-

4. The United States had a tariff on raw sugar imports, and a higher tariff on
refined sugar imports throughout most of the 19th century. At that time, beet

sugar required second-stage refining.The differential in tariffs between raw
and refined sugar was high enough to make the effective rate of protection to

refining greater than 100 percent. The best means of determining whether sugar

2.2. The Demand for Sugar and Sweeteners.

More than 70 percent of U.S. sugar consumption is by industrial users bakeries,

soft drinks, confectionary, cereals, etc.. The remaining 25-30 per-

cent of consumption goes through distribution directly to consumers (defined

as all sugar sold in bags of less than 50 pounds).
Consumption of refined sugar in the United States peaked at about 10.7

million pounds in 1972, equivalent to about 102 pounds per capita. At that
time,

per capita consumption of all caloric sweeteners (corn sweeteners,

honey, etc.) was 13.3 million tons, or 25.1 pounds per

capita.5

By 1986,

American consumption of sugar had fallen to 7.44 million tons, or 61.1
pounds per capita, while total caloric sweetener consumption had risen to
15.898 million tons or 130.4 pounds

per capita.6

2.3 The International Sugar Economy

5. This contrasts with an estimated consumption per capita of 9 pounds in the
United States in 1822 (see Johnson, P.5). Here and throughout, the reader
should be alert to units: production is often measured in terms of tons of
cane or beet; these units (contrast Tables 2 and 3 below) are obviously different from those that measure the weight of refined sugar produced or consumed. Since the yield of cane and beet varies from year to year and place to
place, conversion ratios are not a constant. However, the conversion factor is
close to 10:1 — for example in 1986, 28.743 tons of cane were produced, which
was 3.4 million tons of sugar, raw value. For beet, 25.229 tons were produced,

with 2.989 million tons of sugar, raw value produced. See USDA, Sugar and
Sweetener Situation and Outlook Yearbook, June 1981. For an amusing discussion
of the problems of administering an import quota set in terms of raw value,
see House Hearings 1974, Pp. 95-101.

6. Consumption of non-caloric sweeteners has also risen; in 1970 it is estimated that they accounted for 5.8 pounds per capita cons.nnpt ion, while by
1987 they were 18.5 pounds per capita. There are many grounds for believing
that much of the increase in consumption of noncaloric sweeteners may have
represented a shift in tastes, rather than a consequence of relative price
changes. For that reason, the evolution of noncaloric sweetener production and
consumption will not be further considered in this paper. Taking it into ac-

count would not significantly alter the argument at any stage, as total consumption of noncaloric sweeteners still occupies less than 15 percent of the
combined market.

9

There are few countries in the world that do not intervene in their
domestic sugar markets. Perhaps this is because both temperate and tropical

countries

can grow sugar. Regardless of the motives for intervention, the

result is that about three quarters of sugar grown in the world is consumed in
the country of production.

For this reason, the international market

is sonewhat thin, with about

27 million tons out of an estimated total world production of about 100 mil-

tons (sugar equivalent, both cane and beet) entering into international

lion

trmde (Sugar and Sweeteners Situation, June 1987, P. 35) in the 1985\86 crop
year. Even out of that total, the existence of a number of preferential arrangements (including the American quota and Cuban-USSR trade) has meant that

the "free market" price has governed only a small fraction of transactions.
American preferences are diminishing in importance, however, as American im-

ports

have fallen, for reasons that will become evident below, from 6.2 mil-

lion tons in 1977 to an estimated 1.5 million tons in l987.

The price of sugar has always displayed volatility on international
markets. Two

another sharp decline in price as new supplies appeared by 1976,

and the price fell for the next two years. By 1980, however, production had

lower prices, and

the price again rose sharply, reach-

ing 29.02 cents per pound by the end of 1980.

Thereafter, the world price fell

and remained depressed for a long period

as American imports declined sharply and the European Community increased ex-

ports as its production surpluses mounted. It was estimated in 1985 that, if

all countries were to adopt free trade in sugar, the world price would be
about 12 cents per pound.9 That contrasted with an actual price at the end of
that year of about 4 cents per pound and a U.S. price of 20.3 cents per pound.

8. Cuba's exports and quota constituted the vast majority of sugar imports
into the United States prior to 1960. In 1959, for example, Cuba exported
3,437,582 million tons to the United States out of total imports of 4,273,000
tons. This contrasted with domestic production of 4,702,619 million tons in
that year. By 1961, Cuba's exports to the United States were zero. See Senate
Finance Coninittee, Hearings on Extension of the
Act of 1948,1965, p.
ll.Cuba's estimated share of the world sugar trade was 28.6 percent in 1961,

and 24.67 percent in 1984. The Soviet Union replaced the limited States as the

major market for Cuban sugar in the l960s. See Tan for particulars of the
Soviet-Cuban sugar trade.

Program1°

There have been few years in American history when sugar has not been the

object of some degree of intervention. It has always been an importable.
Starting in 1796, a tariff on imports was imposed, and until the late 1800s,
revenue was the major motive for the tariff, as domestic production was less
than ten percent of consumption, with imports supplying more than 90 percent

of the U.S.market.''

Philippines met U.S. demands, and little sugar was imported from other

The initially recommended quotas were set with a base equal to the

mittee.

It did come under the latter. But one of the interesting 'accidents'
with important consequences was that when the Jones-Costigan Act was first up

for renewal in 1937, the Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee requested, as a favor from his colleague and friend, the Chairman of the Ways
and Means Conpnjttee, that the House Agriculture Committee handle sugar mat-

ters. The Chairman of the House Ways and Means Coimiitteeacceeded to the re-

quest, and the House Agriculture Committee has handled sugar matters ever
since.See

Price for an account. Because there is a tax on sugar imports, only
the House may initiate legislation. This right of initiation, combined with
the fact that sugar is the only agricultural commodity considered by the
Senate Finance Committee has resulted in unusually great power concentrated in
the hands of the House Agriculture Committee for dealing with sugar. See the

discussion of the 1962 bill below for one instance where the Senate opposed
the House decisions but in the end was unable to prevail.
17. Johnson (P. 30) believes that American refineries had lost their comparain the 1920s and used the 1.07 to one conversion ratio as an
argument for protection which they needed on other grounds. Taussig 's documentive advantage

tation, however, suggests that the protection accorded to American sugar
refineries as early as the 1870s was more than sufficient to provide needed
protection and monopoly profit. See his interesting discussion of the "Sugar
Trust"(Taussig, 1924, Ch. VIII). Taussig cites testimony before Congress in
1888 by the head of the American

Sugar Refining Company (the Trust) to the ef-

fect that "the mother of all trusts is the customs tariff bill". Taussig 1924,

for renewal in 1937, however, they had switched sides, and actively supported
the sugar program and production and import quotas. (See pp. 16-45 of the 1937

Corporation (based in Florida) opposed the 1937 bill on the grounds that
Florida could expand production and indicated a preference for unrestricted
sugar imports unless Florida's quota was increased substantially (P. 168 of

legislation was the moral debt owed to Cuba, because of Cuban steadfastness in

providing sugar to a wartime ally. As passed, the intent of the legislation
was to "protect foreigners' interests in the U.S. market'. This was to be acproduction to 55 percent of

Tariff Act of 1909 which gave the Philippines the right to export 300,000 tons
duty-free to the limited States. The duty-free allotment had then been expanded
during the First World War. The Philippine production of sugar had expanded

greatly in the 1930s. According to the U. S. Tariff Commission, "the most
rapid expansion in both acreage and production occurred in the years 1932-34,
when the question of Philippine independence was being debated by Congress.

as the several independence bills then under consideration provided
for quotas on sugar to be allocated to individual mills and to planters on a
production basis, there was an incentive to increase output and hence quota
allotments. As a result, Philippine sugar production reached a peak of
1,509,000 short tons in 1934. Since that year it has declined because of the
quota provisions of the Jones-Costigan Act and the Independence act." U.S.

It is perhaps significant that only one sugar consumer testified in 1948:
the American Bakers Association sut4uitted a short letter indicating its support of a one-year extension of the Sugar Act, and urging a study of the effects of the sugar program (P. 54 of House Hearings).

The sugar program was changed very little throughout the 1950s. Cuba's

share of imports fell somewhat as other countries' production increased, but
remained at 3.4 million tons in 1958, contrasted with 980 thousand tons from

the

Philippines and 291 thousand tons from all other foreign sources. The

an indication of how complex formulae can become,

percent to mainland cane; the next 20,000 and

however, was not to receive any change in quota. Meanwhile, if any domestic

areas failed to fill their quotas, these should be reallocated to other domestic areas and Cuba only.
During the 1950s, acreages allocated to cane and sugarbeet in the United
States remained relatively constant, but production increased somewhat due to

rising yields. In 1950, 406,000 acres of cane and 924,000 acres of sugarbeet

had been harvested with yields of 34.9 tons and 14.7 tons per acre respectively. By 1960, 406,600 acres

of land

were devoted to sugarcane and 897,000

acres were devoted to sugarbeet. Yields had risen respectively to 40.0 and
18.7 tons per acre.23
5. Expanding Domestic Production and Acreage, 1962 to 1974

5.1. The Battle over the Cuban

A major shift occurred after

1959, however, as

American relations with Cuba

soured. A first step was to amend the earlier legislation to permit the Presi-

dent of the United States to determine the Cuban quota for the period June
1960 to June 30, 1962, and to permit imports from alternative sources not to
exceed

the amount

by which the Cuban quota was reduced. Cuba's quota was

thereupon reduced to zero from July 1960.

A political battle over the future of government policy toward sugar then
ensued. The original motives for the 1948 Act were no longer valid. (ie solution, advocated by economists in the Administration and outside the government, would have been to abandon quotas both on domestic production and on im-

ports, and to permit a return to free markets; if not that, at least a global
quota (rather than country-specific allocations) would have made sense and
were in fact finally supported by the Kennedy Administration. The domestic

growers, and especially beet growers, however, seized the opportunity to urge

that their production quotas be increased to make up part of the Cuban short-

fall, and advocated a continuation of the program.24 It should be noted,

However, interests of the refiners of raw (i.e. cane) sugar did diverge
from

those of growers of cane and sugarbeet,

and from those of beet and cane

millers: reducing the quantity of raw sugar imported and increasing domestic

produotion would necessarily reduce economic activity for raw sugar (cane)

cane were locatcd

in coastal areas, where imports of raw Cuban sugar (once-processed

Although opposition to the bill arose both from those opposing giving
something of value to foreigners and from those who wanted to protect domestic

growers, the Sugar Act of 1962 nonetheless passed in a form which enlarged
and/or extended quotas to other foreign producers but simultaneously allowed

for increases in domestic production.26 Thus, total acres of cane and beet
harvested rose from 1,370,000 in 1960 to 2,065,000 in 1970.27
25. The 1962 Congressional Almanac commented that "Although sugar legislation

is not a partisan issue, it has touched off some major Congressional battles
in recent years. In general, the Senate has supported the Administration,
while the House has followed the lead of its Agriculture Committee, where
sugar legislation originates.
In 1962, the Administration and the House were in accord on increasing
domestic quotas, but differed sharply over the foreign quota provisions, with
te Administration resisting reassignment of a portion of the reserved Cuban
quota to other countries on a permanent basis, and the House supporting such
reassignment. . .A controversy arose over the role of lobbyists representing

foreign interests, who stood to gain large fees if their clients' countries

received quotas. . .1962 Congressional Quarterly Almanac, P. 128. I am indebted

26. The version passed in the Senate was considerably more liberal than that
passed in the House, but it was the House's version that survived the conference committee. See Berman and Heineman for an account.

27. Almost all of this increase took place on the U. S. mainland. Acreage
planted in Hawaii rose about 200,000 acres between 1960 and 1970. However,

acreage and production in Puerto Rico declined over this period, apparently
21

The 1962 Amendments to the Sugar Act of 1948 included a provision under

which there would be acreage allotnents granted to yield 65,000 short tons,
raw value of beet sugar. Localities were to be selected without regard to
earlier producing history,

"firmness

in accordance with the following criteria:

of capital commitment for construction of factory facilities,

need for a cash crop, distance from other producing localities, suitability
for sugarbeet production and accessibility to sugar markets.

157,000 acres were committed to localities in which six new beet mills
would be constructed, and another 15,000 acres were allotted in areas where
existing mills were thought to have additional capacity.26 Over $20 million
was invested in additional beet refining capacity. The designated localities

were Mendota, California (1963), Herefore, Texas (1964), Drayton, North
Dakota (1965), Montezuma, New York (1965), Easton, Maine (1966) and Chandler,
Arizona (l966).29

Cane production and milling capacity were also expanded: during the l960s,
eight mew raw sugar mills were constructed in Florida, so that there were nine
large mills in 1970 compared to three in 1960.

due to the high costs of production relative to other U. S. sources. It is
difficult to determine the reason for Puerto Rico's apparemt cost disadvantage. Sugar was grown on small farms in Puerto Rico, and it is probable
that scale economies, combined with rising real wages in Puerto Rico resulted
unprofitability of the crop. There is some discussion of Puerto Rico in the
House Agriculture Hearings of 1974 on the Sugar Act Extension of 1974, p. 293.

5.2 Administration of the Program

The Sugar Act was renewed, with amendments, until 1974. There were difficulties in both administration and enforcement during these years. For ex-

ample, sugar tended to be shipped to the United States early in the quota
period, leaving U.S. refiners with storage problems. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture

therefore began restricting the amount of sugar that could be im-

ported under quota in the first part of the year.3°
There was

also

a problem of how to keep domestic acreage within the desired

limits. For some regions, including Hawaii for the entire post—war period and
Puerto Rico after 1956, this was not an
high

issue as prices were not sufficiently

to induce increased plantings. For other areas, however, the Secretary of

Agriculture was to determine proportionate shares to be allocated to individual farms. These shares were the fraction of a region's allotment that
could be produced by the individual farm. These proportionate shares were en-

forced by a 'conditional payment' granted to farmers staying within their allotments, which constituted an important part of their income. Farmers could

feed excess cane or beet to livestock without penalty but could not sell it

to the mill; the mill, in turn, could buy it

legally

but would not have been

able to market it and therefore had no incentive to do so.
This,

in turn, caused difficulties in

areas where it appeared there would

be excess production, because each producer wanted to sell to the mill before

the mill's allotment was exhausted. When this happened, "panic selling"
started. To stop this, the Secretary of Agriculture was entitled to impose
Marketing Allotments for individual farms, indicating the proportion of each

farmer's crop that could be sold to the mill.

Finally, there was even quota—exempt sugar importation, for the following
situations:

5.3 Interest Groups

These administrative complications notwithstanding, the Sugar Act continued to be approved, with amendments until l974. Long before that, various
groups initeres ted in the sugar program had organized themselves. There was a

Foreign lobbyists wore also important. Cater, in his Washington expose of
1964, focussed inter alia on the "sugar subgovernment". As he described it,

"since the early l930s, this agricultural conuaodity has been subject to a
cartel arrangement sponsored by the government. By

prescription, the

market is divided to the last spoonful among domestic cane and beet

growers, and foreign suppliers. Ostensibly to insure "stability" of supply,
the

U.S. price is pegged at a level considerably above the competitive price

in the world market...

Political power within the sugar subgovernment is largely vested in the
Chairman of the House Agricultural Committee who works out the schedule of
quotas.

It is shared by a veteran civil servant.. .who provides the necessary

"expert"

advice for such a complex marketing arrangement. Further advice is

provided by Washington representatives of the domestic beet arid cane sugar
growers,

the sugar refineries, and the foreign producers." (Cater, P. 18)

6. Cessation of the pg

1974

and the Era of No Program, 1974-1981

During 1973—74, the price of sugar skyrocketed, rising from 9.61 cents per
pound on the world market in 1973 to 44.97 cents per pound at the end of 1974,

having

reached a high of 57.17 cents in November of that year. The Sugar Act

was up for renewal arid came to a vote during the period of high prices. At

that time, the U.S. price was a little below the world price, so that the
quotas to recipient countries were valueless and there was no protection to
American producers. Indeed, there was

discussion

in the hearings as to whether

it was reasonable to expect Hawaiians to ship raw sugar to the mainland when

they would receive a higher price in Japan. Simultaneously,consumer groups

The National Consumer Congress testified in

favor of failing to renew the

Sugar

Act, eliminating all quotas, and going instead to an income—support

basis

for sugar growers. The consumer group also advocated efforts to reach an

international agreement to stabilize sugar prices.3
The Department of Agriculture supported extension of the Sugar Act, but
wanted to end domestic quotas and direct payments.

It

also requested a 3-year

extension (only) of the program, with the stated intent of considering ways of

bringing the sugar program under general agricultural legislation. The
Users

Sugar

Group recommended a two-year extension of the program, and advocated a

wide corridor for the price targets of the Secretary of Agriculture. Simultaneously, it opposed bringing other sweeteners under the program or controlling them in any way. The National Confectioners Association also supported
extension of the bill, but advocated quotas on imports of conectionary imports

as an essential part of the legislation.
Thus, support still appeared strong for a sugar program, but it was less
cohesive than had earlier been the case and the various producer and user
groups could not agree on what they wanted.

however arid thus remained subject to agricultural prpice supports. In addition

there

remained a duty on imported sugar.

During the early iO7Os, a technology for producing a virtually-perfect
substitute for sugar in liquid uses from corn (high fructose corn syrup —
liftS) was developed. Until the high sugar prices of 1973—74, however, it was
uneconomic relative to sugar. With those prices, however, HFCS came to be
produced in increasing quantities and to be used instead of sugar in some commercial uses.
In 1978, a new sugar act was proposed. For the first time, the sugar

13 to 23 cents per pound raw value as its target price range. As can be seen
from Table 1, the ISA was unable to prevent the price from exceeding this

38. The Administration had not advocated a support price for sugar, but apparently accepted it in return for support for other legislation, probably in
part because it was not anticipated that the world sugar price would fall so
or so soon. The Senate had passed a support

program. But sugar price supports were passed as part of the 1981 farm program

after the particulars had been worked out in conference coninittee. Loans until
the end of March 1982 were to be made at the rate of 16.75 cents per pound raw
basis and 19.70 cents per pound of refined beet sugar. The Secretary of
Agriculture was instructed to set the price for the 1982 crop at a level not
less than 17 cents a pound, for the 1983 crop at 17.5 cents a pound, at 17.75
cents for 1984 and at 18.00 cents for 1985. Growers could get a loan at these
prices from the CCC, and decide not to reclaim their produce, which in effect
meant that they would repay only if the price rose above the support level.

ticipated that the support price could be maintained by altering the tariff
and fee

applicable to sugar imports (which the President was authorized to do

under existing legislation). It was anticipated that the purchase price would
not

be attractive

relative to the world price, and

that the domestic price

could be adequately supported through import duties and fees .

One

amendment

to the bill, which was adopted, prohibited the financing of the sugar program
from government revenue sources. Thus, the CCC could not buy sugar that would

not be repurchased by farmers, for it would have had to take a loss to do so.
Once the law was passed, a number of market reactions enused. There were

unusually large imports at the end of 1981 in anticipation of the higher
tariffs that would be imposed.4° Also, by late May, the Department of Agricul-

ture had to issue regulations that a sugar processor could not sell more to
the government than the minimum he had had on hand over the preceeding six-

month interval. A Washington Post article suggested that sugar processors had

deposited more sugar with the ftC than they in fact had with the intent of
forcing the government to impose quotas •4 1

In 1ay, emergency quarterly import quotas were established on a country-bycountry basis to avoid a loss to the Treasury" 42
At that time, it was estimated that the "cost of production' of sugar was

nondiscriminatory clauses of GAfl pertaining to the in-

of quotas.44

As can

be seen from the price disparities in Table

1, the divergence be-

tween American sugar prices and world prices were now so great that difficulties were bound to ensue. From the raw sugar (cane) refiners' viewpoint,

a major difficulty was that quarterly quotas prevented any

futures

contracts.

One of the precipitating factors blamed by the administration for its
inability to maintain the domestic sugar price at the legally mandated level
without CCC purchases was the fact that some sugar was being imported under
the Generalized System of Preferences, under which some developing countries
were permitted to export to the U.S. at less than normal duty rates. Since
most sugar imports came from developing countries, the GSP legislation undermined the effectiveness of the tariff. The Administration also pointed to the
42.

Community sugar policy as a source of excess supply on the world
market, and hence of the declining world price. Later on, a similar policy

dilemma arose between the Caribbean Basin Initiative and

sugar price supports.

See Terpstra, 1982, p. 10

44. Until 1974, the United States could impose quotas legally under GAfl because its agricultural legislation had been in effect from GAfl's initiation
and had therefore been subject to "grandfathering'. However, quotas had to be
nondiscriminatory to qualify when they were reimposed in 1981, as grandfathering no longer applied. When American policy toward Nicaragua shifted, the Administration eliminated the Nicaraguan sugar quota. Nicaragua sued the United
States in the International Court of Law and won its case, although the United

States failed to provide redress.

They therefore the Government before the U.S. Court of International Trade.
The Court, however, ruled in favor of the U. S. government, so quarterly im-

port quotas persisted. .4
At

least six Presidential proclamations had

to be issued between 1982 and

1983 to attempt to contain the side effects. Among the more interesting was
the effects on trade with Canada. Canada had no protection on sugar and im-

ported it at world prices. The Canadians at first added 6 percent corn syrup
to sugar, since anything less than 94 percent sugar was not "sugar" from the
viewpoint of the regulations. This was then shipped to northern U.S. points
and sold to U.S. producers of sugar-containing preducts. When these shipments

reached 175 thousand tons a year, they were banned. Then, Canadian firms
began producing high—sugar content cake mixes and other products, which were

exported to the United States where, once again, the sugar was extracted.
Canadians firms also shipped sugar into the U.S. as "packets of cocoa and
tins of maple syrup and in Aunt Hetty's Patent Pancake Mix" (quoted from the
Economist,

cited below). These, too, were banned. However,other countries' ex-

ports of sweet preducts to the U. S. also rose, so that

January 1985 emer-

import quotas were placed on all imports of sweetened cocoa, cake mixes

and edible preparations. This latter category was

filled

by March 5, 1985,

meaning that no Korean noodles (.002 percent sugar), kosher pizzas, or other
preducts

with any sugar could be imported for the remainder of the year

import prohibitions were put on all sugar—containing products after these, and

other, responses to the price differential had been felt. Noteworthy were the

Philippines, is to be imported at American prices, refined, and may not be
sold in the United States, i.e., it must be reexported at world prices. The
1980 Qanibus spending bill allotted $100,000,000 million to cover the financial loss under this program, equal to 12 cents per pound). Obviously, this

Hawaii, which will be discussed further below. Even with the relatively high

sugar prices of recent years, there has been little expansion of acreage
devoted

to cane and

actual

contraction of acreage devoted to beet.

Moreover, this does not appear to be an entirely new situation. In 1974,
Johnson concluded that the sugar program was an evil system, costing between
$500 and

$730

million, depending on

whether

the premium per pound

was 1.5 or

2.5 cents(Johnson, p.50). This contrasted with gross farm income from sugar
at that time of about $870 million.49

Johnson estimated that the average income per sugar farm in 1972 was

$619,856 in Florida, $312,611 in Hawaii, $75,089 in Louisiana, and above
$30,000 in all sugar-producing states except Puerto Rico, Colorado, Montana,
Nebraska, Utah, Michigan, and Ohio.

There were altogether 175

tion workers in 1971, but their average hourly earnings (both in growing and
processing) were significantly below the average for persons with comparable

training and

skills

in each state.

Johnson concluded that

the net benefits — the net increase in income going to farm—owned
resources — are only a small fraction of the gross benefits. Most of the gross

transfers are required because the U.S. is a high—cost producer of sugar.
Many resources are used in sugar production that would readily find employment
elsewhere. . .Much of the gross transfer is required to induce these resources

to

be devoted to sugar production rather than their next best

alternative.. . (Johnson, P. 58)

Turning

to analyze beet and cane

separately,Johnson

found no evidence that

the price of sugar beet land (near mills) was significantly different than the
pricing of other land in beet growing areas. He notes that:
"I must admit that these results surprised me. I had expected to find some

positIve effect.. .There has been considerable political pressure to establish
new sugar beet producing areas, and it seemed reasonable to assume that

faraers expected to gain from these efforts.. .(P. 61) Of the six new beet
processing

plants established after 1962, 2 (New York and Maine) were

'complete failures" (because they could not obtain enough sugar beets to
onerate).

that

The acreage

allotted to sugarbeets in Arizona had been only half

anticipated when the plant was built (P. 61). Moreover, the Secretary of

Agriculture had not, at that time or since, had to impose "proportionate al—
lothsents" on any producing area since 1966.

As

for cane, Puerto Rican production and acreage had been declining for a

decade at the tine of Johnson's analysis. For Hawaii, most benefits went to
the large producers, as noted abeve, as 25 out of the 705 sugar farms produced

93 percent of the sugar.50 In addition, field worker wages in Hawaii were
36

double tile national average and Johnson concluded that "it is quite possible
that some of the economic rent from sugar production in Hawaii has been captured by approximately 5,000 farm workers."(p. 67)51

show 58 beet processing factories operating in 1970, 56 operating in

1975, 43 operating in 1980, and 36 operating in 1986. There were 75 sugar
mills processing cane in 1970, and the number fell to 42 by 1986.52
Certainly,

refiners of imported raw cane sugar lost

from the sugar program,

at least starting with 1970 and the increased inroads of HFCS. Some went
bankrupt, and the total demand for their product fell sharply as beet and
sugar

substitutes replaced imported

raw cane sugar.

There is little reason to question Johnson's conclusions today. Indeed,
subsequent bankruptcies, the failure of the industry to expand despite greater

protection and higher prices relative to some other crops, all suggest that

most of the cost of the sugar program was absorbed by the excess cost of
production.

Indeed, even the argument

first put forth

in 1934 ——

that

the

United States should have some domestic production capability in the event
that foreign supplies were disrupted ---no longer seems compelling in light of
the HFCS substitution possibilities.53

Johnson noted the disappearance of data on size of sugar farms

from the Census of Agriculture starting in 1969 (Johnson, P. 66).

51. Taussig, 1915, pointed to innigrant workers as the chief gainers in Hawaii
from sugar protection, asserting that native Hawaiians, like native Americans,
would not work in cane fields. Taussig, 1915, Ch. 5, P. 65.

The Rationality of the Actors

One

of

the fundamental assumptions of economists is that individuals are

rational in their own

self

interest. Even with individual rationality, of

course, a group does not necessarily maximize as models of the prisoners'
dilcimna readily demonstrate.

There are two issues here. First, how well did the representatives of the
various interests (cane and beet growers, cane millers, beet refiners, and

refiners) know their own

interests?

raw

Second, was the collective

rational, in the sense that policies could have been devised that ren-

dered all concerned better off?

In the sane way that more alternatives are always preferable to fewer,
there must have been short—run gains to those already growing sugar, or with

the possibility of growing beet or cane, from the sugar program at most points

in time. That does not, of course, prove that the gains were maximized. For
example, had the sugar program in 1981 been established to provide deficiency

payments to farmers (compensating for the difference bewtween the price

If, however, there is a

then the role of knowledge becomes important, since to assert a need

happening.55.

Moreover, even then, it seems apparent that many of the gains of the
sugar

program

prior to the 1970s did not go to American interests: many for-

eign countries were

gainers.56

Certainly there was considerable political op-

position aroused by the activities of foreign lobbyists, especially in 1962

when they were widely blamed for having achieved the 1962 reimposition of
country-specific quotas .' One might have thought the domestic sugar interests

made to prohibit HFtS. While this relates to the transparency issues as well,
other factors were also involved. See below for a discussion.

56. They did not gain by the full amount of the premium times
quota, of
course and some with small quotas into the American market probably lost. For
most countries, sugar was sold both to the United States at premium prices and
on the residual world market at much lower prices. To the (considerable) extent that the world price would have been higher in the absence of American

quotas, only those sugar exporters gained whose quantity exported to the
United States times the premium exceeded the quantity they exported to the
rest of the world times the amount by which the world price was below its nosugar-program level. However, it was not until 1985 that any foreign representative in Washington publicly opposed the program.
57. See Berman and Heineman. Since focus here is on domestic economicpolitical interactions, many of the irrationalities involved in the allocation

of foreign sugar quotas are ignored here. Suffice it to note that the

not appear to have happened.

Furthermore, there are a number of actions that were NOT taken that would

have been rational, if one accepts the viewpoint that the overall program was

beneficial to sugar interests.5a To cite just a few: If large Hawaiian growers
really profited from the program, one would have expected them to be suff i-

ciently rational to support a price ceiling in 1974, rather than to permit the
opposition that arose to the vory high (and very tenporary) price of sugar to
defeat the entire program; 2). why did the sugar interests accede to American

efforts

to support the International Sugar Organization in the late l970s

rather than push for more effective action?; 3) why in the early 1960s did the

ugar interests so adamantly support country-specific quotas, when they could

have bargained for a larger donestic fraction of the market with a global
quota?

Then, too, there is a list of positive mistakes if one takes a narrow,
short-run,

self—interest model and accepts that the sugar program did help

American sugar over the short run. There seems little doubt that many

(P. 425). They proceeded to cite a quota of 15,000 tons for

Panama (which had produced only 5000 tons a year) and several other countries
which could not meet their quota, as well as quotas for the Netherlands and
Ireland (although a separate provision of the bill prohibited imports from
countries that themselves imported sugar as these latter two countries do).

in the large, there have clearly been a number

of

actions which

could at best have been very short-term maximization. Given that the United

States will shortly stop importing sugar altogether, and that high fructose
corn syrup and crystalline fructose corn can be expected to continue to take
an increasing share of the market (along with non—caloric or low—caloric
sweeteners

which are better able to compete at higher sugar prices) it is in-

teresting to asic whether the sugar program has even been in the long-run interests of Hawaiian and other low—cost growers.

Moreover, there seems to have been no effort to bring HFCS under regula-

even

less so of refiners. Had sugar growers

At present, the corn producers strongly oppose any switch to deficiency

in

the sweetener market. Indeed, Congressional representatives fron corn-

producing states now appear to be the strongest supporters of the sugar
program, including import quotas. Whether that support group would have

had sugar

producers correctly estimated the potential competition

corn is an open question. Certainly, to the extent that corn producers
are the gainers from the sugar program, there is no evidence of their apparent
from

support for the program prior to the l970s.

The apparent reason for the sugar growers' opposition to deficiency payments seems to have been their concern that a ceiling would be placed on the

size of the payment that might be made to any individual farm. This in itself

suggests that growers were sensitive to the degree to which benefits went to

larger

farners, but it does not indicate why refiners and processors were

willing to support import and production quotas.6'

Even beyond that, however, there lies the question --alluded to by Johnson

as to why in the early 1960s it was anticipated that there would be great

benefits to expanded beetsugar production. These do not seem to have been
forthcoming, and the evidence strongly suggests that such an exponsion was not
in

the interests of existing producers and did not significantly benefit those

in areas where new beetsugar mills were established.

If one is to believe statements from representatives of the sugar interests, sugar producers have not been happy with the program. According to the
Economist after the 1985 bill was passed:

It might be supposed that the sugar-growers at eas, would be happy

with the absurd press for regulations. They are not. They get a government
subsidy of 17 cents a pound, but say it costs them 20 cents to produce one.

There is then the curious episode with the International Sugar Associa-

tion: the ISA could not contain the price of sugar even within a very wide
band. In part this was because the EC did not join. However, it is difficult
to imagine that, even with EC participation, the target range could have been
maintained without resources considerably in excess of those available to the

ISA. It is difficult to believe that the ISA was expected to be
stabilizing the sugar

as

effective in

price: why, then, was support for ISA membership taken

an acceptable substitute by the sugar producers for a sugar program?
Next,

there

is an interesting question as to why some arguments are con-

vincing, or are thought convincing, in the

political arena.

Virtually all

witnesses to Congressional hearings on the sugar program listed as one of its

major

virtues

the fact that "it costs the taxpayer nothing".62

62. See, for example, the statement contained in the House Agriculture Committee pamphlet on the U.S. Sugar Program (1971): "The Sugar Act has given us
this security of supplies at a reasonable cost to the consumer and at no cost
to the taxpayer. . . "P.45. Note, however, that the decision to permit the import

Congress in December 1987 invalidates this argument, and of course sets a
precedent for subsidies to support exports in future years.

A second oft-repeated argument pertained to the alleged instability of the
international sugar market arid the 'need' for price stability for producers.
This argument

reiterated by almost all witnesses supporting the Sugar Program. Yet the

program was

neither designed for "stability" (since there was no ceiling) nor

were there efforts to set a "band" within which the price might fluctuate.
Whether

it was thought that appeals for "stability" were more convincing than

for support prices is open to conjecture, but the inconsistecy of
rhetoric pertaining to stability with the appeals for higher prices strikes

one on even the most casual perusal of Congressional testimony.

Although a large number of other apparent irrationalities could be pointed

to, it suffices to mention one more: surely in 1974 and again in 1981, it
should have been understood that the prevailing price of sugar would not con-

tinue indefinitely. Even without any degree of sophisticated understanding of

the sugar market domestically and internationally, all testinony before both
houses of Congress had

years emphasized the wide fluctuations in sugar
prices as a reason for controls. Yet the Reagan administration apparently

An interesting point to note with respect to lobbying models, however, is

Lobbying, at least by domestic growers, was NOT significant in the in-

not lobby for it. In that

respect, the Bhagwati—Srinivasan revenue-seeking model, in which

resources are

The conservative

social welfare function argument reasonably well fits the

motive for introduction of the sugar program in 1934; it does not explain its

reintroduction in 1948, its continuation of country-specific quotas after
1960, nor the evolution of the program thereafter.

Thus, there is no doubt that econonic interests and lobbying go part way
toward explaining the sugar program. There are missing elements, however, to

which attention turns below. First, it

and that alternative arrangements might have reduced the economic

costs of the program, even if they would not have eliminated it. Secondly, it

is clear that markets reacted to the various shifts and turns in policy in
ways which neither politicians nor sugar interests anticipated. In this sense,

there never was "the" sugar program; rather, policies evolved over time as
politicians reacted to market responses (and exogenous events) and markets

reacted to the changes in policy. Finally, any reading of the evolution of

to these missing ingredients that attention now turns.

8.4 Institutional Issues

Several institutional issues are noteworthy. First, there is the anomaly
(for the American congress) that sugar legislation was handled by the Senate
Finance Committee (because it is an import) and the House Agriculture Com-

mittee (by historical accident). Moreover, because it was an import and thus

had revenue implications, only the House had the power to initiate legislation.

This gave the House Agriculture Committee considerably more power over

sugar than it would have had had the counterpart body been the Senate Agricul-

ture Committee, and the House Agriculture Committee had considerably more

ability to focus its attention on sugar than would the House Ways and Means
omniittee 64
Second,

the sugar program could not have persisted in anything like the

form that it did had sugar not been an import. At a minimum, there would have
been a budgetary cost to any program which raised price. As mentioned above,
the 'lack of budgetary cost" was frequently mentioned as an important point by
advocates of the program. Likewise, because sugar was an import, the program

provided instruments of foreign policy (the sugar quotas) which would otherwise not have been present. Moreover, had sugar not been an import, it would

tion would have been spread over enough other issues that it could not have
devoted as much tine to it as did the House Agriculture Committee. Moreover,

as was the House Agriculture Committee. For a discussion of these issues, see

likely that the ability of sugar interests to influence the outcome (for better or worse in their own

self

interest) would have been less.65

Indeed, it is arguable that

continuation of tho program. Indeed, until the mid 1970s, what is remarkable
is that the Sugar Users Group did not oppose the program.

Fourth, the fact that the interrelationships wero complex undoubtedly increased the political influence of those who did undcrstand the economics arid
politics

of

the sugar program: in a sense, the complexity of the issues stood

as a barrier to entry of nonspocialists.66

8.5. Interaction of Economic arid Political Markets

65. The above paragraph was written prior to the passage of the 1987 omnibus
spending bill. That bill sets a precedent for expenditures on supporting sugar

prices that may ease the way for subsidy payments when sugar is no longer imported. Even so, one might guess that pressures against sugar will mount when
the program must be financed from the budget.

66. In some hearings late in 1974 after the defeat of the Sugar Program, a
number of witnesses were called. The first was a Mr. Arthur Calcagnini, Direc-

tor

of the Sugar Division, USDA. He was carefully examined on his move from
Amerop Corp., international sugar dealers, to USDA which had taken place earin 1974. Other witnesses included: Mr. Thomas 0. Murphy, the USDA Sugar
Division Director from 1963 to 1972, who was in 1974 President, United States

her

Sugar Beet Association; and Mr. Lawrence Myers, who had been USDA Sugar
Divisioin Director from 1948 to 1963, and who was a "consultant in agricul—
tural economics and economic adviser to the Philippine Sugar Institute." (P.
81). See also Sect. 8.6 below

48

Examination of the history of the sugar program strongly suggests that,
once created, a policy instrument will: 1) be seized upon by groups who per-

ceive themselves to benefit (regardless of whether they had anything to do
with initiating the program or not); 2) induce economic market reactions which

will minimize the costs of the program; 3) lead to political responses to (2)

by the groups formed under (1) to attempt to offset these economic market
reactions, which in turn will lead to 4) increasingly complex policy instru—

merits designed both to deal with the competing interest groups that form
around the policy instrument and simultaneously to subvert the sorts of market
responses perceived

to be detrimental.

This sequence, which
perhaps

as

articulated, sounds very straightforward, is

most obvious, but also the most complex, of conclusions. For it

suggests that, once an instrument is in

a

variety

of political forces

emerge that will act upon it and try to seize it in ways that are largely

unpredictable. In the case of the U.S. Sugar Program, the instrument was ini-

tially opposed by the sugar producers, but they very quickly reversed their

position and supported

its continuation. Likewise, the sugar exporting

countries strongly supported the program until the mid-l980s, and then
reversed

their position ii response to the market forces set in motion by the

price support program.

Ironically in 1948, it was a perceived obligation to Cuba, rather than any
motivation

of domestic producers that led to the reinstatement of the program.

During the years 1948 to 1960, Congressmen dealing with the sugar program were

regarded virtually as foreign agents primarily

ests.

49

There are two interesting mental experiments that can be performed; 1)
what would have happened had the Cuban government not changed? and 2) what

would have happened if there had been no sugar program prior to 1960 when the

Cuban government changed? In answer to the first1 the most reasonable conjecture would appear to be that the U.S. sugar program would have continued, muoh

as before, and that there never would have been the expansion of beet acreage
and other high—cost (and possibly even ill—advised on the part of those who

undsrtook them) and beet refining capacity that characterized the 1960s. It is

hard to imagine the impetus that would have been necessary to substantially
increase American acreage at the expense of imports.

With regard to the second question, had there been no sugar program in
1960, the most likely outcome probably is that the United States would have
continued buying sugar on world markets. It is difficult to imagine a sequence
of events under which a changed Cuban government could have been seized upon

as a rationale for the inauguration of a Sugar Program.

Insofar as these conjectures are plausible, they strongly suggest that it
is much easier to adapt, or seize, an already—existing instrument, than it is
tc have a mew one created. For that reason alone, an existing instrument is
very likely to become used for objectives and by groups that may not have been

the

intended beneficiaries at all when the instrument was first formed.

There is then the question of market reaction. Clearly, the market will

minimize the cost of any given policy-imposed distortion. In the case of
sugar, this entailed two important reactions and several minor ones. The
first important reaction was the shift in the location of preduction (with

expansion of Florida land and reduction in beet land). The second was the

dif-

to see how the political process can further increase the real price of

longer term, this market reaction to the sugar program may indeed threaten the

economic viability of' the entire sugar industry in the United States - thereby
doing the very thing that many supporters of the sugar program claimed they
were trying to avoid.
The minor reactions include the importation of soft drinks, cake mixes,

and

other sugar-containing products from Canada and elsewhere, the need for
detailed regulation of imports to avoid storage costs for American refiners,
the seizure of the program by sugar refiners as a basis on which to press for
a ban on imported raw sugar or of refined beet sugar, and the diplomatic and
other complications arising out of establishing and implementing import quotas

for a large number of countries. An interesting reaction, difficult to classify, has been the increased volatility of the international sugar price in

minimizing ways, it will likely be seized upon by groups and in circumstances

only remotely related to the initial intent of the program. Once put in place,
a policy may evolve in ways unrelated to the initial purpose.67
8.6. Role of knowledge and technocrats

Partly because of the interaction of economic and political aarkets, any
ongoing program is likely to become very complex. While sugar may be espe-

cially so, it is at least arguable that other agricultural commodities, imports subject to quota, health regulations, and most other policy instruments
inevitably become highly complex. One important consequence is that a coterie

of specialists is called for whose human capital consists of their understanding of the program, arid hopefully of the economic implications of alternative
changes in policies.68

Complexity in and of itself provides a significant barrier to participation of nonspecialist groups in the decision process. In the case of sugar
legislation,

it seems

evident that there were a number of efforts to resist

changes that might have made the program more transparent: sugar producers opposed deficiency

payments (until it

was too late) probably because the size of

would have been apparent and they feared a ceiling; import

67. One needs only to point to the complexity of American income tax laws
(even after reform) and of the Multi Fibre Arrangement to convince oneself
that the phenomenon is not limited to the sugar case.

68. One indication of the ways in which these interests grow is to exanine the
length of hearings and the number of witnesses who appeared before the House
Agriculture Committee each time the Sugar Act was under consideration. The
1934 Hearings were 251 pages long, with 33 witnesses; in 1937 Hearings were
373 pages long, with 47 witnesses. In 1940, Hearings were 302 pages with 40
witnesses; the 1948 Hearings were short with 114 pages and 10 witnesses; l95i
hearings were 323 pages with 46 witnesses and submissions; 1955 Hearings were
768 pages with 136 withesses and submissions; 1962 Hearings were 552 pages
with 81 witnesses and submissions; 1965 Hearings were 365 pages with 74 witnesses and subaissions; 1971 hearings were 789 pages with 132 witnesses and
submissions. Even this understates the increase, as coalitions of supporters
(such as the Sugar Users Group and the Sugar Producers Group) formed.

52

quotas were country-specific, rather than global, and there was opposition to
any change; import quotas, rather than tariffs were the chosen instrument for
protection raw sugar refiners supported the program and sought prohibition of

imports rather than seeking protection from foreign refiners; and corn
producers were adamant in wanting sugar prices supported rather than seeking
higher support prices and deficiency payments for corn growers directly.

In addition, however, the specialists in a given policy instrument become a
vested interest in the maintenance of SCtIE policy.69 Those with understanding

of the U.S. Sugar Program could seek employment as lobbyists for foreign
governments, or as representatives of domestic groups, as Congressional staff
assistants, or with the Department of Agriculture. For any nonspecialist to
enter

the policy dialogue in a meaningful way

would require a considerable in-

vestment.
All

of

these phenomena suggest that public discussion of policy options

might be significantly improved if means could be found to keep policies

transparent and simple. The opposition to deficiency payments and other
transparent

procedures was clearly based on the hypothesis that they would not

have withstood careful scrutiny. Whether means can be found in complex markets

of limiting the types of interventions that are permitted is a difficult subject, and one well beyond the scope of this essay. Nonetheless, it seems
highly likely that, had the Sugar Program been transparent and readily comprehensible to an informed citizenry, it could not have persisted in anything

like the form it did.

69. It might be argued that they would prefer some changes because that gener-

ates more work, but that issue is secondary. The hypothesis here is that the

loss of human capital that would be involved in the complete abandonment of a

program is probably so large as to induce specialists to advocate "more rational" programs, rather than program abandonment.

At a more general level, two tentative lessons emerge. First, at the very

advised to recognize that the measures they advocate will, once enacted, have

a life -

including supporters - of its own. Second, in choosing between alter-

native policy instruments, there should be a strong presumption in favor of
simple, transparent instruments: the likelihood that those instruments can be
seized in ways unacceptable to a comprehending electorate would be reduced.
