Obstacles

to International Macroeconomic
Policy Coordination

Jeffrey A. Frankel
1.

Introduction

It is possible to define international macroeconomic

cooperation

quite broadly, to include for example the exchange of information among

policy makers.

But it is probably desirable to reserve for the term

international policy coordination the more precise definition that is

understood in the academic literature the agreement by two or more
countries to a cooperative set of policy changes where neither would

wish to undertake the policy change on its own, but where each expects
the package to leave it better off, relative to the Nash non—cooperative
equilibrium in which each sets its policies taking the other's as given. 1/
The gains are supposed to come specifically from externalities, or "spillover'
effects that one country's policies have on other countries' economies but
that the first country would have no incentive to take into account in the
absence of coordination.

If each country has well—defined objectives and

1/ Other definitions of coordination are possible as well. For example,
under our definition, a switch from a floating exchange rate regime to a
fixed exchange rate regime would, if it improved welfare by avoiding comsubstitute for coorpetitive appreciation or depreciation, be a practical
dination; but some authors choose to define such internationally—agreed
changes in regime to be a form of coordination (e.g., Melitz (1985)). For
a review of definitions of coordination and related concepts, see Masson
and Home (1986), chapter 13 to Corden (1985) or Kenen (1987). For an
introduction to the literature, see Oudiz and Sachs (1984), Cooper (1985)

or

knows the true model of the world mscroeconomy,

then it follows in genersl

that there will exist cooperative solutions that are Pareto—improving,
i.e., that do leave all countries better off. 1/

This theoretical proposi-

tion makes successful coordination sound straightforward, even easy.

But

when we visualize the practical process of coordinsted policy—making, we
can identify serious obstacles at each of three stages.

At the first stage, each country must decide what specific policy
changes it would like to ask the other country, or countries, to undertake,

and what it would, for its part, be willing to give up to get them.

One

can think of this stage as taking place in internal deliberations in advance
of a c—s or Summit Meeting.

At the second stage, the two or more countries

must negotiate how the gains from coordination are to be distributed.
can think of this stage as constituting the actual bargaining.

One

The nego-

tiations might result in a set of agreed—upon target economic indicators.

2/

At the third stage, the agreement must be enforced, including a clear way
of verifying which countries are abiding by the agreement, in addition to a
There are two important qualifications to the generality of the
standard proposition thst coordination improves welfare. The first is
that if policy—makers have enough independent instruments to reach their
optimum target goals regardless of each others' actions, then coordination
is moot. The second is that Rogoff (1985) has shown that if coordination
reduces governments' ability to precommit to snti—inflationsry policies,
credibly to their own peoples, then it can reduce welfare.
2/ At the Tokyo Summit of May 1986, it was decided that the 0—5, or
henceforth the 0—7, would focus on a set of "objective indicators". At
the September 1986 IMF Annual Meetings, the use of these indicators was
publicly discussed. The indicators at this time had more the nature of
targets that each country hoped to attain using only its own policy instruments, rather thsn targets that were set cooperatively.
Mevertheless,
these indicators might be viewed as prototypes for the variables that the

countries would bargain over

From a reading of the existing literature, one might think that the only
obstacles to coordination occur at the latter two stages:

These three elements follow very simply from the algebraic expression
for the welfare function.

In the Nash noncooperative equilibrium,

in which each country takes the other's policies as given, we would need
only equations (2), (3), (4*) and (5*) for the solution. Each country
ignores the effect that its policies have on the other country, so
equations (4), (5), (2*) and (3*) do not enter.

These

The

focus here is on the fact that the economy may not be at an

optimal point, either the constrained optimum of the Nash noncooperative
solution or the Pareto—improving move to the cooperative solution, due to
the policy—makers' lack of knowledge regarding the relevant parameters.

is so great that we typically cannot identify the sign of expressions (4)

it should want to ask the foreign country to expand or contract its monetary
and fiscal policies in order to improve its own welfare.

Similarly,

as we

can't be sure of the signs in expressions (2) and (3), the domestic country

doesn't know how to respond to foreign requests for changes in its policies.
This uncertainty is a serious stumbling block to any effort at coordination.
One might reasonably argue that this uncertainty is no different
from the uncertainty that always plagues policy—making, and that the
implication for governments is simply that they should maximize expected
welfare. 1/

But international spillover effects, which are the essence of

international coordination, are more subject to uncertainty, particularly
with respect to their sign, than domestic effects.

One can argue in defense

of discretionary domestic policy (as opposed to rules of the monetarist type)
that a small policy change in the desired direction is better than none.

It is more difficult in the face of uncertainty to make the argument that
some internationnal coordination is better than none.
Four conclusions emerge from this paper.

First, if policy—makers in

the l980s are serious about activist international coordination, they
should begin by specifying clearly in what direction they wish their partners
to move their policies,

and what they are willing to give up for it; other-

wise, vague calls for coordination must be considered political. Second,
we should recognize that the result from the theoretical literature, that
coordination necessarily improves welfare, is overly strong.

If policy—

makers are mistaken about their initial position, about the appropriate
weights on the targets, or about the policy multipliers, then coordination
may reduce welfare, instead of increasing it.

Third, even when it works

out that coordination improves welfare, the magnitude of the gains is so
small that it is usually dwarfed by the potential gains from unilateral
policy changes, except in the case when the authorities know the initial
position, target weights, and policy multipliers precisely.

Section & considers the effects of unilateral policy changes based on the
use of better models and draws some conclusions.
2.

Uncertainty regarding the initial position

It is clear from the above equations that uncertainty as to the initial
values of y, x, and it——output, the current account, and inflation——relative

to their optimums, translates into uncertainty as to the desirability of
various policy changes.

This type of uncertainty can, in turn, be broken

into three components.
First is uncertainty as to the current value of the target variable in
question.

It is well known that GNP and the other variables are measured

with a lag, and are often revised subsequent to the initial estimates.
In a recent study of U.S. GNP revisions, Mankiw and Shapiro (1986) find
that the standard deviation of the revision from the preliminary estimate
of the real growth rate to the final number is 2.2 percentage points. 1/
Some statistics are reported in Table 1.

Since the mean of the true growth

rate over the sample period was 2.4 percent per year (and the standard
deviation 4.6 percent) the revisions are very large.

—8—

point

out that when the preliminary estimate indicates no growth, the

probability that the final estimate will exceed 2.0 percent is 18 percent
(assuming a normal distribution),

Sometimes we don't know whether the

economy is currently in a boom or a recession, to within a 90 percent
confidence interval.

Even the preliminary estimate is available only

60 days after the midpoint of the quarter, not contemporaneously. 1/
Furthermore, there could be large errors in the final GNP numbers, due to
both conceptual and measurement problems.

The initial estimates of inflation

numbers also contain measurement efrors, and the trade statistics have
been notorious in recent years, both for undergoing large revisions in the
case of the United States, and for failing to satisfy "adding—up" constraints
across countries, which indicates the existence of large measurement errors.

Until 1985, a 'flash estimate

was available 30 days after the midpoint

of the quarter. Mankiw and Shapiro find that the revision from flash
estimate to final number also had a standard deviation of 2.2 percent. Note
that the revisions in nominal GNP are larger than in real GNP (because the true
variability of nominal GNP is larger).

forthcoming year or more in the absence of policy changes (the "baseline

This information is relevant on the assumption that any policy

changes agreed upon will have their major impact beginning in a year or
more, rather than immediately.

Kenen and Schwartz (1986) have studied the accuracy of current—year forecasts
by the IMF World Economic Outlook for the last fifteen years (1971—85).
These forecasts usually appear in April or May of the year in question,
and are based on information available through February or March.

Errors would presumably be much

larger for the horizons of two years or more that are probably most relevant

effects of monetary and fiscal policy peaking in the second year in the
case of output, and not reaching a peak within aix years in the case of the

Estimates

Zero

again seems a natural choice, under the Polonius Principle of international
finance: "Neither a borrower nor a lender be." 3/

But estimates of optimal

current account balances can vary widely; theoretical analyses suggest that

the optimal rate of borrowing (or lending) can be quite large, to finance
either longer—term investment and growth or shorter—term shortfalls in
real income.

1/ For example, as of 1986, James Tobin estimates the U.S. natural
rate of unemployment at about 5 3/4 percent and Herbert Stein at about
7 percent. Moreover, there is no particular reason why the natural rate
of unemployment or potential output should be the optimum value relative
to which society measures y in the objective function (1). The official
target for U.S. economic policy under the Humphrey—Hawkins Act is 3 percent unemployment.
2/ Though even here, Milton Friedman has argued that the optimum rate
of inflation might be less than zero (the negative of the real interest
rate, to equate rates of return on money and capital).
3/ Dooley and Isard (1986) argue that whenever one country incurs substantial net indebtedness to another, it runs the risk that the debtor
will find irresistible the temptation either to default explicitly or to
impose other taxes on foreign holdings; this argument suggests that a zero
current account balance might be desirable.
Summers (1985) argues that
governments, for political reasons, do indeed seek current accounts of
zero.

under the "locomotive theory". However, there is nothing in that paper to
suggest that the Americans would not have been as aware of the difference

would simply be making the sort of selfinterested proposal that is a common
part-of any bargaining process. This is different from the situation that

turns out that the countries will in general be able to find a

package of coordinated policy changes that each believes will leave it
better off, even though each has a different view of the effects and
thus may not understand why the other is willing to go along with the
package.

To take a typical outcome, if the United States monetary

authority believes in the NCM model and other countries'

monetary

authorities believe in the OECO model, then it turns out that they will

find the Nash noncooperativeequilibrium to be overly contractionary, each
country afraid of expanding on its own for fear of worsening its current
account balance.

They will consider a coordinated package under which each

This is the kind of coordinationurged by the United States.

But whether a

joint monetary expansion actually succeeds in improving their objective
functions depends on the true model.

If the true model is the MCM, then

the United States will indeed be better off; otherwise it would not have
agreed to the change.

Similarly,

if the true model is the OECD, then the

other countries will be better off.

But it turns out that if the LIVPL,

VAR or MSG models are the correct ones, then the coordinated monetary
expansion will not have the effects anticipated and will actually leave
both countries worse off.
If we consider eight possible models, there are 512 combinations of

models that can be used to represent the beliefs of the U.S. policy—makers,
the beliefs of non—U.S. policy—makers, and reality.

We find that coordination

To take an example, if the United States subscribes to LINK and the other
countries to LIVPL, the resulting package of coordinated policy changes

in the 1980s:

a U.S. fiscal

contraction, accompanied by a fiscal expansion in Europe and Japan, and
monetary expansion all around.

The usual argument is that this will reduce

the value of the dollar, and therefore the U.S. trade deficit, without
causing a world recession.

Extensions of the analysis of disagreement regarding multipliers
Some readers have suggested that, in a world in which different models

abound, it is not sensible to assume that each policy—maker
knows with certainty what model his opponent subscribes

acts as if he

to (the opponent

having no incentive to reveal his beliefs in the absence of cooperation),
1/
These statistics in a sense are biased in favor of gains from coordination, because they include the one—eighth cases in which the policy—maker
turns out to have had the correct model so that coordination necessarily
improves his welfare.
Statistics that count only cases where the policy—
makers' models are different from the true one are reported in Frankel and
Rocktt (1988).

—

or

24 —

even what model he himself considers to be the correct one.-'We now

consider extensions in each of these two directions, in turn.
To begin with, we retain the assumption that each policy—maker believes
in his own model with certainty, but we allow for uncertainty regarding the
other's model.

The policy—maker will set his policies so as to maximize

expected welfare, a weighted average of the economic consequences of each
of the policy—settings that the foreign government would choose under each
of the possible models to which it might subscribe. 2/
Tables 7 to 9 report the effects on the United States and the rest of
the OECD, respectively,

of allowing for uncertainty regarding each other's

models, still under the Nash noncooperative equilibrium of monetary policies.

Each country is assumed to give equal weight to all of the possible models
to which the opponent can subscribe.

Table 7 reports the movement from the

baseline specified in the Brookings simulations to the Nash noncooperative
equilibrium, under 36 combinations (6 models subscribed to by the United
States and 6 by the other player). The changes in money supplies to get to
the equilibrium are usually quite close to what they were in the earlier

case where each knew the other's model. The effect of this movement,
depending on the true model, is reported in Table 8 for U.S. welfare and
in Table 9 for non—U.S. welfare.
The interesting question is the effect of coordination, under the
assumption that each player averages to estimate the other's model.

Table 10

1/ E.g. Hoitham and Hughes Hallett (1987).
2/ The algebra is spelled Out in Section 4 of Frankel and Rockett (1986).
The numerical results reported here are new.

how money supplies change, and with them perceived values of the

target variable and welfare, in the movement from the Nash noncooperative
point under averaging to the Nash cooperative point.

It is assumed that

part of the cooperation is that each reveals his model to the other.

One

country or

the other may lose bargaining power by having both their models

revealed.

For this reason, the "perceived gain" reported in the last two

lines of each cell in Table 10 is sometimes negative, even though the

perceived gain from coordination with no change in information must
necessarily be positive.
The actual effect of coordination depends on the true model, as usual.

Table 11 reports the change in welfare for the United States and Table 12
for the non—U.S. countries, under each of the six alternative candidates
for the true model.

If we include all eight models,

coordination under

averaging improves U.S. welfare in 265 cases or 52 percent of the time, out
of the total of 512 combinations,

as against losses in 245, and improves

non—U.S. welfare in 264 cases, again 52 percent of the time as against
losses in 246.

As Table 6 shows, these odds are slightly worse than the

case where each knows the other's model with certainty. This may be because,
once the policy—makers

find Out each other's models in the Nash non-

cooperative equilibrium, there is less left to gain by coordinating.
In the second extension, we relax the assumption that each policy—
maker acts as if he or she is certain as to the correct model.
that they assign weight to each of the possible models.

We assune rather

To preserve some

disagreement about models, we could assume that each puts primary weight on
a favorite model of his own, but is reasonable enough to put some weight
also in the other models (perhaps with larger weight on the favorite model
of the other player on the theory that he must have access to some
independent information.

Here we consider, instead, the simple case of

—

uniform weights.

26 —

As a result, each will be playing by the same "compromise"

model.
When policy—makers act as if they believe in the "compromise" model
based on averaging the multipliers in the eight equilibrium models, the
Nash non—cooperative equilibrium implies a 6.97 percent U.S. monetary
expansion relative to the baseline, and a 3.81 percent contraction of the
money supplies in other countries.

According to most of the models (though

not the VAR, MSG or LIVPL), this would raise U.S.
income,

income and lower non—U.S.

The welfare effects of averaging models, as compared to the same

Nash noncooperative equilibrium when each policymaker acts upon a single
model held with certainty, are reported in Table 13 for U.S. welfare and
Table 14 for non—U.S. welfare. The six possibilities shown each for the
"model subscribed to by the U.S." and "model subscribed to by Europe" are
those that the respective policy—makers
promise model.

give up if they move to the com-

The move raises welfare relatively often.

When all eight

models are used, averaging raises U.S. welfare in 334 cases, as against
losses in 178, and raises non—U.S. welfare in 301, as against losses in
211.
The probable reason that averaging usually raises welfare is the simple
statistical principle that the average of eight numbers is closer to the
individual numbers, on average, than the individual numbers are to each

other.

27 —

The principle does not apply directly, because each policy—maker

parameters does

imply that the Nash equilibrium will be better.

not necessarily

But it seems to work here.

The next step is the move from the noncooperative equilibrium to the
cooperative equilibrium, while maintaining the assumption that each policy—
maker averages multiplier estimates. Based on the compromise model, a
move to the Nash bargaining point consists of a 3.87 percent reduction of
the U.S. money supply and a 5.11 percent increase in the non—U.S. money
supply.

The consequence, according to most of the models, is to lower U.S.

output and to raise non—U.S. output (with more divergence regarding the
current accounts, as noted earlier).

According to the compromise model, the

policy change lowers U.S. output by .60 percent, raises the U.S. current
account by .10 percent of CNP, raises non—U.S. output by 1.03 percent, and
raises the non—U.S.

current account by 0.11 percent of GNP. 1/

The key

question is whether this coordinated policy change improves welfare under
various candidates for the true model.

This represents a better case for coordination than prevailed

when each had his own model (63 percent against 56 or 58 percent), as can
be seen in Table 6.-"
1/ One could attempt to rationalize the compromise model's prediction that
both the U.S. and non—U.S. OECD current accounts improve, by positing a
decline in prices of imports of oil and other commodities from less developed
countries. But the magnitudes of the current account effects are in any
case very small.
2/ Note that when the policy—makers have the same compromise model, there
are only 8 possible outcomes, rather than 8.
3/ Hoitham and Hughes Hallett (1987, p. 24), on the other hand, find that
"There is no advantage in using a synthetic model, which averages the properties
of competing models; they generate nearly as many losses as the worst of the
'named' models."

—

28 —

An alternative interpretation of the results on averaging

is that the

two policy makers retain their beliefs in one model or another, but that in
the interest of improving on the non—cooperative equilibrium, they agree to

an alternative kind of cooperation:

they bargain directly over the correct

model rather than just over policy—settings,and then they maximize joint
welfare gains, as in the Nash bargaining solution but using the compromise
model.

Line 6 in Table 6 reports the count for welfare gains from this

kind of cooperation: 317 or .62 percent for U.S. welfare and 296 or .58
percent for non U.S. welfare. 1/

As the results in Tables 13—16——or

the

overall counts in lines 4 or 7 of Table 6——show, most of these gains can be
reaped by averaging to get better model estimates alone, without a
simultaneous move from the noncooperative to the cooperative solution.
The results reported here suggest the possibility that a type of
cooperation that includes compromises

on the model might raise true welfare

more often than simply trying to maximize perceived joint gains with each
going by his own model.

It offers some support for the conjecture that

ministers in G—5 and Summit Meetings might do better to discuss their
beliefs directly,

rather than simply telling each other how they should

adjust their policies.
1/ Recall that in the experiment where each policy—maker believes in a
with certainty, the statistics included the one—eighth cases in which
the policy—maker turned out to have had exactly the correct model, so that
the odds were biased in favor of coordination improving welfare. That is
not the case here. In the experiment where the models are averaged, as in

of this paper —— have not been sufficiently often emphasized by academic
economists.

The gains from better informationon the model
We have already established the perils of cooperative policy—making

when using the wrong model.

One might wonder about similar perils of

policy—making even without cooperation.

If the policy—maker is wrong

about the initial position, or about the welfare weights, or about the
multipliers, then he will not necessarily be able to attain the optimum
Nash non—cooperative equilibrium.

How much could policy—makers improve

welfare simply by discovering the true model?
The last four tables show the effects, staying within the Nash
non—cooperativeequilibrium, if one policy—maker,

who may previously

have had the incorrect model, discovers the correct model.

Table 17

shows the effects on U.S. welfare of a model switch, for six possible

gains of course are zero.

Otherwise,

the gains are often substantial.

For example, when the United States believes the MCM and the true model
is the Liverpool model, the gain to switching is 2.4091 (assuming the
other country is playing by the Liverpool model), which translated from

the terms of the quadratic welfare function,

(

/2.4091)

of GNP.

is worth 1.55 per cent

Similarly when the United States believes the Liverpool

model and the true model is MCM, the gain to switching is 8.0902 (assuming
the other country is playing by MCM), which is worth 2.84 per cent of CNP.

In occasional cases, the U.S. gains from switching to the correct model are
negative,

because there is a loss of bargaining power and the other country

moves in an undesirable direction. But the gains are usually positive and

often large.

—

30 —

One sense jn which the gains from unilateral moves can be seen to

be

"larget'

is to compare them to the potential gains from coordination.

In sections 4 and 5 we saw that the effect of a move from the Nash
non—cooperativeequilibrium to the cooperative equilibrium could easily
have a negative effect on welfare if the policy—makers are using the
wrong models.

But we now give coordination the benefit of the doubt.

We report in the first column of Table 17, for each of the six possible
models, the effect on U.S. welfare from coordination under the assumption

that both countries know the true model.

These six numbers are thus a

sort of upper bound on the gains from coordination.

In three casea

(the Liverpool, OECD and LINK models) the potential gain is about .013,

worth only 0.1 per cent of GNP.

The gain is even more negligible in

the case of the MCM, and is substantial only in the case of the MSG
model.

1/

It remains true that the gains from unilaterally switching

to the correct model are usually positive and often quite large, in
contrast to the potential gains from coordination,

which are always

small.

1/ Although equations (2)—(5*) were presented in terms of two policy
instruments for each country, the preceding tables reported here have
referred to monetary policy alone. Frankel and Rockett (1986) report
further effects of coordination when both monetary and fiscal
policies
are used.

—

It

31 —

is not a new finding that the potential quantitative gains from

coordination,

even under the conventional assumption that they are

necessarily positive because the true model is known, are small.
Oudiz and Sachs, among others, found the same result, and attributed it
primarily to the small trade multipliers that in practice link the
United States with the rest of the OECD, let alone with individual
countrias./But it is interesting to see the magnitude of these
gains compared side—by—side

with the gains from unilateral improvements

in policy—making.
In the context of U.S. policy in the 1980s, a commonly proposed policy
coordination package is a reduction in the U.S. budget deficit, accommodated
by a monetary policy of allowing interest rates to drop so as to maintain
nominal GNP growth, accompanied by expansion in Europe and Japan.

Some

economists have argued that most, if not all, of the gains from this
policy package could be accomplished if the United States policy—makers
were to do their part unilaterally. In 1983 and 1984, it seemed to some

Indeed,

it is possible,

as suggested

in an earlier footnote, that the real purpose behind Secretary 'aker's
efforts

to gather momentum in international meetings for worldwide interest

rate cuts is to overcome political obstacles to a switch in the monetary!
fiscal policy mix at home.

Another example of this phenomenon would be

when finance ministers of other countries, meeting at the OECD and elsewhere
in the late 1970s, "psyched themselves up" to return hone and push through
measures to reduce their countries'

budget deficits.
