The Pass-Through of the Largest Tax on Sugar-Sweetened Beverages: The Case of Boulder,
Colorado
John Cawley, Chelsea Crain, David Frisvold, and David Jones
NBER Working Paper No. 25050
September 2018
JEL No. H22,H75,I18
ABSTRACT
We estimate the incidence of a relatively new type of excise tax, a tax on sugar-sweetened
beverages (SSBs). We examine the largest such tax to date, which is two cents per ounce, in
Boulder, CO. Using data that were hand-collected from stores and restaurants in both Boulder
and two control communities, as well as internet data of restaurant menus, we find that the tax
was largely, but not completely, passed through to consumers 5-7 weeks after implementation.
Some retailers add the tax only at the register, indicating that estimates solely from posted prices
would result in an underestimate of pass-through.

The incidence of taxes is a classic topic in public finance. Economic theory indicates that the
relative burdens of a tax are determined by the market power of firms and the elasticities of supply
and demand (Kotlikoff & Summers, 1987; Fullerton & Metcalf, 2002; Weyl and Fabinger, 2013).
For example, in a perfectly competitive market, if demand is completely inelastic or if firms face
constant marginal costs, pass-through would be 100 percent and consumers would bear the entire
burden of the tax. If the market is imperfectly competitive, taxes can be overshifted (price may rise
by more than the tax) if oligopolists find it optimal to reduce output and charge higher prices in
response (Anderson, de Palma, & Kreider, 2001; Bonnet & Requillart, 2013). Numerous studies
have estimated the pass-through of taxes on products such as cigarettes and gasoline.1
We estimate the pass-through of a relatively novel tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs).
Numerous organizations, such as the World Health Organization, Institute of Medicine, American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Public Health Association, have called for taxes on
SSBs because SSBs contribute to obesity and poor health (Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, 2014). In addition to being high-calorie and zero-nutrient, SSBs have a high glycemic load
(i.e., they significantly raise blood sugar), which, independently of obesity, contributes to insulin
resistance and diabetes (Malik & Hu, 2011).
Many countries recently implemented taxes on SSBs, including Australia, Denmark, Finland,
France, Ireland, Mexico, and the United Kingdom (Thow et al., 2018). Within the U.S., several
cities have adopted taxes on SSBs: first Berkeley, CA, in 2015; followed by Philadelphia, Boulder,
and Oakland in 2017; and San Francisco and Seattle in 2018.2 All of these city-level taxes are
imposed on beverage distributors who sell to retailers.
Given the relative newness of the taxes, their effects are not well understood.3 Comparing
1 Empirical

estimates of excise taxes on alcohol, clothing, cigarettes, and gasoline often find that 100 percent or
more of the taxes are passed through to consumers (e.g., Besley & Rosen, 1999; Poterba, 1996). A smaller body of
literature finds partial pass-through, in the range of 45 to 85 percent (e.g., Doyle & Samphantharak, 2008; Harding et
al., 2012).
2 Many states also impose sales taxes on soft drinks, although they are very small, are primarily a tool to increase
revenue, and apply to diet as well as caloric soft drinks (Fletcher, Frisvold, and Tefft, 2010, 2015).
3 There is also a literature examining the impact of SSB taxes outside of the U.S. Several studies find that more than
100 percent of the SSB tax in Mexico was passed through to consumers, although the studies lack geographic control
groups and rely on pre-post comparisons and comparisons to untaxed non-substitute products (Colchero et al., 2015;
Grogger, 2017).

changes in prices in Berkeley relative to those in control cities such as San Francisco, both Falbe
et al. (2015) and Cawley and Frisvold (2017) estimated that 43-47 percent of the Berkeley tax was
passed on to consumers, and the 95 percent confidence intervals rule out full pass-through of the
tax. Cawley, Willage, and Frisvold (2017) examine the tax in Philadelphia within the Philadelphia
airport, which straddles the city border; thus, some terminals are taxed and others are untaxed.
Within the terminals in Philadelphia, the pass-through rate was 93 percent. In response, some
stores in the untaxed terminals raised prices by the amount of the tax.
We contribute to this early literature on the pass-through of taxes on SSBs. Specifically, this
paper is the first to estimate the pass-through of the largest city-level tax on SSBs to date, which
is the tax of 2 cents per ounce in Boulder, CO that was implemented on July 1, 2017.4 Boulder’s
tax on SSBs is substantial; it represents 22 percent of the pretax price of a 20-ounce bottle, 68
percent of the pretax price of a 2-liter bottle, and 53 percent of the pretax price of a 12-pack of
12-ounce cans.5 Thus, its impact on retail prices may be different from that of the smaller taxes
of 1 cent per ounce in Berkeley and 1.5 cents per ounce in Philadelphia. In addition, pass-through
may differ across cities because of differences in the elasticities of supply and demand for SSBs,
or the competitiveness of the local retail markets.
Another important strength of the paper is its rich and varied data. We collected data in person
from stores in Boulder and two control communities in multiple periods before and after the tax.
After the tax, we recorded posted (shelf) prices and purchased a taxed and untaxed beverage. The
tax was levied on beverage distributors, in part, because excise taxes are more salient and, thus,
more likely to reduce consumption (Chetty, Looney, Kroft, 2009). However, we find that not all
retailers included the tax in the posted, or shelf, prices; some instead added it at the register, where
it is less salient.
4 The

tax in Boulder passed by ballot initiative in November 2016, with 54 percent of voters in favor of the tax.
It is an excise tax on distributors and took effect on July 1, 2017. The tax applies to SSBs with at least 5 grams of
caloric sweetener per 12 fluid ounces. It does not apply to diet soda, products in which milk is the primary ingredient,
alcoholic mixers, or coffee drinks. The tax is applied to the size of the prepared product; for example, the tax on the
syrup used to prepare a 32 ounce fountain drink is 64 cents.
5 These percentages were calculated using the mean price of SSBs in Boulder in April 2017, according to our
hand-collected store data.

3

We additionally collected price data in person from restaurants in the same communities because restaurants are important points of purchase of SSBs, and the elasticity of supply of SSBs
may differ between restaurants and stores, resulting in a different level of pass-through. Finally, we
collected weekly data from online menus in these communities. Other strengths of the data include
information about the prices of a wide range of taxed products: various sizes (e.g., 20 ounce and
2-liter bottles), various containers (bottles, cans, and fountain drinks), and a wide range of brands
and products.
We estimate the pass-through of the SSB tax to consumers using a difference-in-differences
design, comparing the changes in prices per ounce over time in Boulder to two comparison areas.
We estimate that the tax increased prices immediately after its implementation on July 1, 2017
and that this increase remained relatively constant for the next four months. The posted prices
increased by 1.1 cents per ounce on average, a 53.2 percent pass-through rate. However, twenty
percent of the stores in Boulder do not include the tax in their posted prices but instead add it at
the register. As a result, pass-through is larger when measured by the register prices: 1.6 cents per
ounce, or 79 percent of the tax.

1

Methods
To estimate the pass-through of the SSB tax to retail prices, we use a difference-in-differences

design, comparing the change in prices (in cents per ounce) over time in Boulder to that in the
control communities of Boulder County (minus the city of Boulder) and Fort Collins, CO. In
our primary specification, based on data from all retail stores and restaurants with two pre-tax
periods (April and June) and two periods after the tax was introduced (August and October) that
we collected in-person, we estimate:
Yisct = β0 + β1 (Boulderc × Aprilt ) + β2 (Boulderc × Augustt )
+ β3 (Boulderc × Octobert ) + γc + δt + θs + ψi + εisct ,

(1)

where Yisct denotes the price per ounce of product i in store s in community c in month t; Boulder
4

is a binary variable equal to one if store s is located in the City of Boulder (and 0 if the store
is located in the rest of Boulder County or in Fort Collins); and April, August, and October are
binary variables equal to one if the price is recorded in that month; June is the omitted reference
month. When we estimate the equation using the weekly online menu data from OrderUp, we
replace the month fixed effects with weekly ones. γc represents community fixed effects, with an
indicator variable for Boulder County and another indicator variable for Fort Collins. δt represents
month fixed effects.6 θs represents store fixed effects. ψi represents product fixed effects.7 ε is a
stochastic error term.
The data include only three geographic clusters (Boulder, the rest of Boulder County, and Fort
Collins).8 Cameron and Miller (2015) show that standard errors that do not account for the number
of clusters can overstate precision unless the within-cluster correlation of errors is solely driven by
a common shock process, which would be picked up by our store-level fixed effects. We cluster
standard errors by store, following Cawley and Frisvold (2017).9 Clustering standard errors at the
community level, using the wild cluster bootstrap method as recommended by Cameron, Gelbach
and Miller (2008), yields similar, but slightly smaller standard errors on the coefficients of interest.
As a result, we report the more conservative standard errors, clustered at the store level.
In the equation listed above, β2 and β3 are the coefficients of interest; they represent the
difference-in-differences estimates of the impact of the Boulder tax on prices in the post-tax periods of August and October respectively, relative to the pre-tax period of June. Comparing β3 to β2
indicates whether the estimate of pass-through changed over time after the tax.
An important assumption underlying this specification is that, in the absence of the tax, the
trends in prices in Boulder would be the same as the trends in the control communities of Boulder
County and Fort Collins. The geographic proximity of these areas, similarities in demographic
6 The results described below are not sensitive to also including day-of-the-week fixed effects and date-of-the-month
fixed effects.
7 We define a product based on the size and the name, so examples of products are a 20 oz. bottle of Pepsi, a 2 liter
bottle of 7Up, a 12 pack of 12 oz. cans of Diet Coke, a 8.4 oz. can of Red Bull, and a small fountain drink.
8 With only two geographic areas and two time periods, clustering can lead to degenerate standard errors (Donald
& Lang, 2007; Cameron &Miller, 2015).
9 To put our limited number of clusters into context, several previous studies of the pass-through of taxes on SSBs
(e.g., Grogger, 2017) had data only for the treated country or state with no geographic control.

5

characteristics and locations of large, public universities in Boulder and Fort Collins are consistent
with this assumption.10 Boulder County is an appealing control group because it has the advantage
of proximity; any unobserved shocks to demand in Boulder around the time of the tax are likely
experienced by the rest of the county. However, the disadvantage is that there may be spillover
effects of the tax due to cross-border shopping by Boulder residents seeking to avoid the tax.
Fort Collins has the relative advantage of being 45 miles to the north, which makes cross-border
shopping from Boulder unlikely.
To investigate the plausibility of our identifying assumption of parallel trends in prices in the
treatment and control areas, we assess the trends in prices in these areas over time. In addition, we
examine the estimates of β1 , which measure any trend in prices during the two pre-tax periods of
April and June that differs between the treatment and control group.
We estimate the above equation for taxed and untaxed products separately. We estimate the
impact of the SSB tax on untaxed products because the tax could cause substitution from taxed to
untaxed products (e.g., from Coke to Diet Coke) that alters the price of the untaxed products.
For our primary estimates, we pool all products and sizes. However, because the price elasticity,
and thus the pass-through, may vary by product size and brand, we also estimate pass-through
separately for the most common product sizes and brands.

Data
We assembled three datasets: 1) hand-collected data of listed prices and purchase prices of

beverages from all retail stores; 2) hand-collected data of listed prices of fountain drinks and coffee
drinks from all limited-service restaurants; and 3) web-scraped data of prices from a selected
sample of restaurant menus. Appendix Figures 1, 2, and 3 show the location of each retailer store
and restaurant where we gathered prices in Boulder, Boulder County, and Fort Collins, respectively.
10 The

City of Boulder is fully enclosed within Boulder County. When referring to Boulder County as a community
in the control group, we are referring to the area of Boulder County that excludes the City of Boulder.

2.1

Hand-Collected Data of Beverage Prices from Stores

We collected beverage prices at four points in time, twice before the tax (April and June 2017)
and twice after the tax (August and October 2017). The four time points enable us to examine
trends in prices before the tax and to compare the pass-through of the tax at two points in time
after implementation.
We collected data from all grocery stores, pharmacies, and convenience stores in Boulder,
Boulder County, and Fort Collins. We identified these stores and their addresses using the ReferenceUSA database, which includes approximately 24 million U.S. businesses and is updated
monthly.11 Data collectors visited and recorded prices from 174 retailers in April, 286 retailers in
June, 287 retailers in August, and 288 retailers in October.12 After the data collection in April, we
expanded the set of retailers to include liquor stores.
We collected the prices of soft drinks, energy drinks, sports drinks, iced tea, juice, water, mixers
for alcoholic drinks, and fountain drinks. We chose the most common sizes and brands to maintain
consistency among the products and reduce the burden on data collectors in the field. We selected
a mix of products that are taxed and untaxed. For example, we selected 20 oz. bottles, 2 liter
bottles, and 12 packs of 12 oz. cans of Pepsi (taxed), Diet Pepsi (untaxed), Coke (taxed), and Diet
Coke (untaxed). We also selected products that are consumed more commonly in Boulder, such as
Hansen’s soda (taxed), San Pellegrino (untaxed), and GT’s Organic Raw Kombucha (untaxed).13
For all products, we collected the posted price and whether the product was on sale. If a store did
not post prices, data collectors asked an employee for the price of the products. We collected this
information for all products in each of the four periods, except that we began collecting the prices
of Hansen’s, San Pellegrino, and alcohol mixers in June (the second of the two pre-tax periods).
The full list of products is shown in Appendix Table 1.
11 Specifically, we included all retailers with verified listings in Boulder County and Fort Collins, CO that are
classified as supermarkets or other grocery stores (NAICS code 445110); convenience stores (NAICS code 445120);
pharmacies and drug stores (NAICS code 446110); gasoline stations with convenience stores (NAICS code 447110);
warehouse clubs and supercenters (NAICS code 452311), and beer, wine, and liquor stores (NAICS code 445310).
12 More details on data collection are presented in Appendix Table 1.
13 Fermented beverages with less than 11 grams of caloric sweetener per 12 fluid ounces were exempt from the tax.
The GT’s Kombucha products that were collected meet this criteria.

7

Failing to consider the register price could lead to an underestimate of the overall pass-through
of the tax to consumers. To test this possibility, we construct the register price, which is equal
to the posted price plus the amount of the tax that is itemized on the receipt, before sales tax is
included. Specifically, in October (after the tax), in addition to collecting posted prices, data collectors purchased 20 oz. bottles of Pepsi and Diet Pepsi from each retailer and kept the receipt. If
the store did not sell these products, the data collectors purchased another taxed SSB and a comparable untaxed product. Based on the receipts, we determine whether the posted price matches the
price that retailers charge consumers (excluding sales tax).14 For most retailers, the posted price is
equal to the register price. However, 16 out of 77 Boulder retailers (20.8 percent) did not include
the tax in the posted price, and instead, itemized the amount of the tax on the receipt. If a retailer
adds the tax at the register for the SSB we purchased, we assume that the retailer does the same for
all SSBs in both periods after the tax was implemented.

2.2

Hand-Collected Data from Restaurants and Coffee Shops

We collected the price and number of ounces of all sizes of fountain drinks from restaurants,
which are taxed if the drink is caloric (not diet). We also collected the prices of a 12 oz. drip
coffee, a 12 oz. latte, a 12 oz. mocha latte, and a 12 oz. hot chocolate from coffee shops, which are
all untaxed. Although a mocha latte and a hot chocolate are sweetened beverages, the City Council
exempted milk-based products from the tax.
We collected data from all limited-service restaurants and coffee shop locations in Boulder
County, including the City of Boulder, and Fort Collins.15 Data collectors visited each of these
restaurants to determine whether the restaurant sold fountain drinks or coffee drinks and to record
the prices and sizes. We collected this information from restaurants in April, June, August, and
14 One

retailer includes sales tax in the posted price. As a result, the receipt price, before the sales tax is included, is
less than the posted price in all periods for this retailer.
15 Specifically, using the ReferenceUSA database, we included all restaurants with verified listings in Boulder
County and Fort Collins, CO that are classified as limited-service restaurants (NAICS code 722513) and snack and
non-alcoholic beverage bars (NAICS code 722515), which includes all coffee shops listed under SIC code 581228.
Limited-service restaurants are restaurants in which customers order at the counter.

8

October 2017, and from coffee shops in June, August, and October 2017. Data collectors visited
236 restaurants in April, 345 restaurants and coffee shops in June, 342 restaurants and coffee shops
in August, and 340 restaurants and coffee shops in October.16

2.3

OrderUp Data of Restaurant Beverages

As a third source of data, we collected beverage prices from the menus of restaurants that
participate in the OrderUp.com delivery platform in the City of Boulder and the Fort Collins area.
There are no restaurants in Boulder County, outside of the City of Boulder, that participate in
OrderUp. OrderUp is an online restaurant food ordering and delivery company that was founded
in 2009 and serves customers in over 60 locations across 22 states.
We were able to collect these data more frequently because we collected these data by web
scraping as opposed to in-person recording. We scraped the OrderUp data weekly, beginning every
Wednesday, from March 22, 2017 through October 25, 2017. The frequency of the data provides
us with greater detail on the timing and consistency of price changes after the introduction of the
tax and of the trends in prices prior to the tax.
The data collection began with 219 restaurants, of which 158 appeared in all waves of data
collection. Reasons for a restaurant not remaining in the sample include termination of use of the
OrderUp system, closures, name or address changes (these are the two identifying variables for a
restaurant), and technical errors occurring when the website is updated and the scrape incorrectly
reads or saves a menu. Of the 158 restaurants consistently in the sample every week, 114 consistently have beverage items throughout the entire period.17 Of the 114 restaurants, 42 are located
within the city of Boulder and 72 are located in the Fort Collins area.18
The types of beverages on the OrderUp menus are more varied than the hand-collected retail
and restaurant data. The OrderUp beverage items in the final sample range from specific branded

number of restaurants selling each product in each time period are shown in Appendix Table 2.
identify products by item name, and size when applicable, thus menu updates that change either variable
exclude the item from the balanced sample.
18 For this sample, the Fort Collins area includes Fort Collins, Evans, Garden City, Greeley, Loveland, and Windsor.
17 We

items (e.g., Coke, Oogave Rootbeer) to general types of drinks (e.g., apple juice, tea). The full
list of items is shown in Appendix Table 3. We categorize each beverage item into one of three
categories based on the Boulder SSB tax law: taxed, untaxed, or unknown. Most OrderUp beverage
items have names that we can categorize as taxed or not under the Boulder SSB law, but some items
have generic names such as “Coke products”, which we cannot definitively categorize. Of the 877
beverage items in the balanced sample, 688 are identified as taxed or untaxed. Some beverage
items contain information on fluid ounces, but the majority only contain the name of the item. The
number of ounces of the product is only known for 67 of the 877 items. As such, for the OrderUp
items, we report price per drink instead of price per ounce. We assume that the number of ounces
did not change over time for the drinks for which size is not listed. Although this is untestable for
all items, there was no change in size after the tax for the 67 drink items of known size, which
supports the plausibility of this assumption.

Results

3.1

Evidence Regarding Parallel Trends

The difference-in-differences method assumes that the comparison community is a valid counterfactual for the treated community. To investigate the plausibility of this assumption, we examine
whether there existed parallel trends in the outcome (prices per ounce) between the treatment and
comparison communities prior to the treatment. We present the trends for taxed and untaxed drinks,
for the hand-collected store data (Figure 1), hand-collected restaurant data (Appendix Figure A4),
and web-scraped restaurant data (Appendix Figure A5). The trends in prices of all taxed products
in Boulder are stable prior to the introduction of the tax in July and are comparable to the trends in
prices of taxed products outside of Boulder over this same period (Figure 1). Graphs of the trends
in prices for specific sizes (20 ounce bottle, 2 liter bottle, 12 pack of 12 ounce cans, and fountain
drinks) and specific brands (Pepsi products, Coke products, and other brands) sold in stores show
similar patterns. The trends in the price per ounce of fountain drinks in restaurants and the price
10

per drink from OrderUp are also stable in Boulder and parallel to the trends for taxed products
outside of Boulder prior to the introduction of the tax (Appendix Figures A4 and A5).

3.2

Difference-in-Differences Estimates

Table 1 presents the difference-in-differences estimates for taxed and untaxed items, separately
for the entire sample (i.e., unbalanced panel) and the balanced panel of products. Results for
taxed items are shown for both posted prices and register prices. Column 1 presents results based
on posted prices for the entire sample. The posted prices of SSBs increased from June (the last
month prior to the tax) to August by 1.018 cents per ounce in Boulder, relative to the control
communities.19 The tax is 2 cents per ounce, so the price increase represents a pass-through of
50.9 percent. In October (3 months after the tax), prices were 1.022 cents per ounce higher than in
June. Thus, prices rose from June to August, which is the month following the implementation of
the tax, and then remained constant through October. Importantly, the coefficient on the interaction
term for Boulder × April suggests that there was not a differential trend in prices between Boulder
and the control communities prior to the tax.
Next, we examine pass-through based on register prices (the results discussed in this paragraph
are not presented in Table 1). Approximately twenty percent of stores itemize the tax at the register;
more than half of these (13 out of 16) are convenience stores. In contrast, only 8 out of 61 stores
that only incorporate the tax into the shelf price are convenience stores. Stores that itemize the
tax at the register also increased their prices on the shelf. The mean shelf price of taxed beverages
in these stores increased by 0.438 cents per ounce (with a standard error of 0.101) from June to
August, while the mean price for untaxed items increased by only 0.147 cents per ounce (with a
standard error of 0.078). Since these stores also itemized the tax at the register, the mean price paid
at the register of taxed beverages increased by 2.438 cents per ounce. In contrast, in stores that
only incorporated the tax into the shelf price (and did not itemize the tax), mean prices increased
by 0.965 cents per ounce (with a standard error of 0.150) for taxed beverages and 0.348 cents per
19 The estimates are similar if we examine each control community separately, instead of combining Boulder County

and Fort Collins.

ounce (with a standard error of 0.138) for untaxed beverages.
Column 2 of Table 1 shows the difference-in-differences estimates using the register prices
for all stores. Prices in Boulder increased by 1.578 cents per ounce from June to August, for an
estimated pass-through rate of 78.9 percent. Again, the estimate for October is very similar to that
for August, implying that pass-through remained roughly constant in the months after the tax.
The third column of Table 1 reports results for untaxed beverages. The effect of the Boulder
tax on the price of untaxed items is small in magnitude and not statistically significant. There is
some evidence of a differential trend in the prices of untaxed products from April to June.
In the last three columns of Table 1, we find that the estimates are similar when we restrict the
sample to the balanced panel of products that are consistently in the sample during all four periods.
Thus, changes in products or stores do not drive the estimates for the entire sample.
We next examine whether the extent of pass-through varies by the size of the beverage, whether
it is a fountain drink, and by store type. Pass-through could vary by size if demand is more
inelastic for individual servings (e.g., 20-ounce bottles) than for larger volumes that are part of
larger shopping trips in which people drive. Pass-through could vary by store type if the elasticities
of demand and supply differ across store type, because of differences in the stores’ marginal costs
or because of differences in their clientele.
Table 2 displays difference-in-difference estimates using the entire sample and register prices
for beverages by size (20 ounce bottles, 2 liter bottles, and 12 packs of 12 ounce cans), for fountain
drinks, and for store types (convenience, grocery, pharmacies, and liquor). There are not major
differences in pass-through by the size of the beverage; it is roughly 75 percent for each. Fountain
drinks stand out because the tax is over-shifted onto their retail prices; prices on fountain drinks rise
by roughly 2.8 cents per ounce or 140 percent of the tax. The pass-through estimates are smaller
for pharmacies and for grocery stores than other types at 52 percent and 64 percent, respectively. In
contrast, the tax is passed through at 84 percent for liquor stores and at 99 percent for convenience

stores.20
Table 3 reports results using the hand-collected data on fountain drinks and coffee drinks from
restaurants. The price of fountain drinks increased by 0.972 cents per ounce in Boulder from June
to August, relative to the price in Boulder County and Fort Collins, implying a pass-through of
48.6 percent. In contrast to retail prices, the prices of fountain drinks in restaurants continued to
rise after August. In October, the relative price per ounce in Boulder was 1.387 cents higher than in
June, for a pass-through of 69.4 percent. As also shown in the table, the prices of untaxed products
in coffee shops did not change as a result of the tax on SSBs. Again, estimates for the balanced
sample of stores are similar to those for the entire (unbalanced) sample.
Table 4 displays results using the price data scraped from restaurant menus on OrderUp. An
advantage of these data is that they could be collected more often, so we have greater ability to
examine any difference in trends between the treatment and control communities prior to the tax,
as well as changes in pass-through over time after the tax. A limitation of the OrderUp data is that
we generally do not observe the size of the drink in ounces, so we observe price per drink rather
than price per ounce, and while we can estimate the change in overall price we cannot estimate
percent pass-through.
The interaction of the indicator variable for Boulder with months prior to the tax (March, April,
and May) yields no evidence of a differential trend between the treatment and control communities,
which is consistent with the identifying assumption of the regression model. For taxed beverages,
the tax increased prices by 17.3 cents in August, 21.1 cents in September, and 20.2 cents in October.
Prices also rose for untaxed beverages following the SSB tax: by 6.5 cents in August, 8.4 cents
in September, and 7.8 cents in October. Beverages of unknown tax status (listed in column 3)
experienced changes in price similar to those of untaxed items. Although we cannot estimate the
percentage pass-through of the tax, these data serve the important purposes of confirming parallel
trends for Boulder and the control communities prior to the tax, and for confirming that the retail
20 The estimates are similar for chain and independent stores. Pass-through rates do not vary based on the distance
of the retailer within Boulder to the nearest competitor in an untaxed area. Pass-through rates are similar for soda,
energy drinks, and sweetened teas, but lower for sports drinks at 53 percent in August. Appendix Table A4 displays
estimates for specific products.

Discussion and Conclusion
This paper provides the first evidence of the impact of the tax on SSBs in Boulder, CO, a tax

that is noteworthy because it is the largest tax on SSBs passed by any U.S. city. Using handcollected data from hundreds of retailers and hundreds of restaurants, we estimate that the tax was
substantially, but not fully, passed through to consumers in the form of higher prices. Data from
transactions at store registers indicate that 79.3 percent of the tax was passed through one month
after the tax was instituted, and that the pass-through remained roughly constant for the next several
months. The pass-through was similar across sizes of SSBs and was larger for liquor stores and
convenience stores than in pharmacies. There is little evidence of any impact of the tax on the store
prices of untaxed beverages. Data hand-collected from restaurants indicates that the pass-through
of the tax was 69.4 percent on fountain drinks, and the tax had no detectable impact on the prices of
untaxed coffee drinks. For restaurants, the increase in prices is slightly more gradual than retailers;
this could be due to restaurants in general changing their prices less frequently than retailers.
It is commonly assumed that an excise tax will be incorporated into the shelf price (e.g., Chetty
Looney, and Kroft, 2009). However, we find that not all retailers increase the posted price of SSBs
in response to the tax. Among retailers in Boulder selling SSBs, 21 percent chose to add the tax
at the register and itemize it on the receipt. Ignoring these decisions of retailers would lead to a
substantial underestimate of the pass-through rate. The estimated pass-through based on posted
prices is 51.2 percent; whereas, pass-through based on register prices is 79.3 percent.
Increasing the price at the register compared to the shelf could have important implications for
the impact of the tax on purchases and the regressivity of the tax. The tax is more salient when
it is included in the shelf price because it is observed at the point of decision-making; consumers
may not notice it being added at the register. Consistent with this, Chetty, Looney, and Kroft
(2009) find that alcohol purchases decrease more when the tax is incorporated into the posted price

14

instead of added at the register. Taubinsky and Rees-Jones (2018) find that consumers are less
responsive to taxes that are not as salient on low-priced items, such as single-serving SSBs. Goldin
and Homonoff (2013) suggest that cigarette taxes imposed at the register could be less regressive
than similar taxes incorporated into the posted prices if low-income consumers are more attentive
to prices at the register than high-income consumers.
Overall, our estimates suggest that the tax on SSBs in Boulder was substantially, but not fully,
passed through to consumers. With the exception of fountain drinks and convenience stores, the 95
percent confidence intervals rule out 100 percent pass-through. The estimates of the pass-through
of the tax in Boulder are larger than estimates of the pass-through of the SSB tax in Berkeley (Falbe
et al., 2015; Cawley and Frisvold, 2017). They are lower than the estimates of the pass-through of
taxes on SSBs in other countries (e.g. Colchero et al., 2015; Grogger, 2017; Berardi et al., 2016;
Bergman and Hansen, 2010); although, this may be because those studies lack geographic control
groups.
These results have implications beyond Boulder. Many cities have recently enacted taxes on
SSBs, and their effects are not well understood. This paper contributes to the growing literature
on the impacts of these taxes. These results also have implications for simulations of the effect
of SSB taxes on consumption, which have often assumed that taxes will be fully passed through
to consumers (e.g., Dharmasena, Davis, & Capps, 2014; Long et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2012).
The results of this paper imply that consumers do not always bear the full burden of SSB tax (e.g.,
pass-through is not necessarily full) and that pass-through rates can vary across different localities.
Strengths of this analysis in Boulder include: (1) multiple periods of prices prior to the implementation of the tax, which allow us to assess whether the trends in prices are similar in the treated
and the multiple comparison communities; (2) multiple periods of prices after the implementation
of the tax, which allow us to determine how quickly restaurants and retailers respond to the tax; (3)
prices from a wide range of products; (4) prices from all retailers and limited-service restaurants
in the three communities, which minimizes sampling error; (5) large sample sizes of hundreds of
stores and hundreds of restaurants; (6) weekly prices from online restaurant menus; and (7) both

15

posted and receipt prices from retailers.
We acknowledge that the comparison communities may be imperfect controls for Boulder,
and we do not observe prices charged by the distributor to retailer. We also lack of information
on sales, consumption, or consumer weight. Another limitation of this study is that we have a
small number of clusters; we examine three geographic areas and four time periods (in the handcollected data, with more periods in the web-scraped data). Despite these limitations, this paper
presents important information about the incidence of the largest tax on SSBs in the United States.

Notes: These items were collected weekly from menus on OrderUp from March 22, 2017 to October 25, 2017, for a
total of 32 weeks of observations. On these online menus, some beverage menu items have a general name (e.g.
soda), and the customer must choose a more specific item when they check out (e.g. Coke). The webscrape only
saves initial menu item names, thus the taxed status of some items is unknown.

Notes: Results in this table are calculated using products from the hand-collected retail data and the prices charged at
the register. The dependent variable is the price in cents per ounce. Items that are taxed include Coke, Pepsi,
Mountain Dew, Sprite, 7 Up, Red Bull, Gatorade, and Arizona Iced Tea. Untaxed items include Diet Coke, Diet
Pepsi, Sugar Free (SF) Red Bull, Dasani Water, Aquafina Water. The estimates show the change in the number of
cents per ounce of the retail price relative to the prices in June in Boulder County and Fort Collins. Standard errors,
in parentheses, are clustered at the store level. Additional variables that are included, but not shown, are community
fixed effects, month fixed effects, store fixed effects and product fixed effects. N represents the number of unique
store specific items, N x T represents the number of unique store specific item observations across all waves. Mean is
the pre-tax average price per ounce in cents.
