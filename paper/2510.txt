The Deadweight Loss froni
"Nonneutral" Capital Income Taxation

ABSTRACT

This paper develops an overlapping generations general equilibrium growth
model with an explicit characterization of the role of capital goods in the
production process.

The model is rich enough in structure to evaluate and

measure simultaneously the different distortions associated with capital
income taxation (across sectors, across assets and across time) yet simple
enough to

yield

intuitive analytical results as well.

The main result is that uniform capital income taxation is almost
certainly suboptimal, theoretically, but that empirically, optimal deviations
from uniform taxation are inconsequential.

We also find that though the gains

from a move to uniform taxation are not large in absolute magnitude these
of
gains would be offset only by an overall rise in capital income tax rates
several percentage points.

A separate contribution of the paper is the development of a technique
for distinguishing intergenerational transfers from efficiency gains in
analyzing the effects of policy changes on long—run welfare.

Introduction
Capital income taxation distorts economic behavior in many

ways.

Since

the work of Harberger (1966), economists have been concerned with the

inefficient allocation of capital caused by taxing capital income from
different sectors of the economy at different rates (e.g. Shoven 1976).
Others (e.g.

Feldstein 1978,

Boskin 1978) have considered the savings

disincentives that even uniform capital income taxes impose.
one type of distortion has received substantial attention

In recent years,
that caused by the

nonuniform taxation of different assets, attributable to such factors as
investment incentives.

An international comparison of capital income taxation

in four countries (King and Fullerton 1984) stressed the great variation in
effective tax rates in each country, and many

authors

(e.g. Auerbach 1983,

Gravelle 1981, Fullerton and Henderson 1986) have estimated the excess burden
caused by such distortions.

Indeed, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 had as one of

its explicit objectives a 'levelling of the playing field

among various

capital investments.
that the efficiency
Many have criticized the 1986 Act on the grounds
to be more than
gains from more uniform business taxation are small and likely
offset by the distortions induced by the increase in business taxes overall,
associated with the widening gap between the taxation of business capital and
owner—occupied housing and the increase in the tax burden on saving (see,
e.g. • Summers 1987).

Such criticism

suggests

that it is important to know the

relative magnitudes of the three different types of distortions.
tax
Unfortunately, previous growth models used to measure capital income
distortions have lacked the interasset and intersectoral detail required to
measure the first two of these distortions, while those models possessing such
detail have lacked an adequate treatment of intertemporal decisions or general

equilibrium effects.

This paper develops a general equilibrium growth model

which is rich enough in structure to evaluate and measure simultaneously these
different distortions yet simple enough to yield intuitive analytical results
as well.
Few critics of the recent tax changes have disputed the argument that, by
itself, a move toward uniform business taxation would increase economic
efficiency, if not by a substantial amount.
unwarranted.

It is a well—known

Yet this presumption could be

principle of "second—best" welfare economics

that, in the presence of some distortions, the introduction of others need not
worsen the allocation of social resources.

What distinguishes differential

capital income taxation from other potential distortions is that it is a

2tio

distortion, a type of distortion that should be eschewed even in

cases where other distortions exist, if the government taxes away pure profits
and has the ability to tax households on all transactions with the production
sector and does so in an optimal manner (Diamond and Mirrlees 1971, Stiglitz
and Dasgupta 1971).

Even without such optimal consumption taxes, results from

a model with a Single production sector suggest that uniform capital income
taxation is still optimal if different types of capital are equally
complementary to labor in production, as would be true if the production
function were separable into capital and labor and exhibited constant returns
to scale (Auerbach 1979).

At the theoretical level, this paper demonstrates that in a more
realistic model of the production process the conditions under which uniform
capital income taxation is optimal will almost certainly be violated.

Even if

every production function in the economy is separable into capital and other
factors and exhibits constant returns to scale, the location of capital goods
in the chain of production and the composition of the capital goods themselves

—3—

play a role in determining which capital goods should be taxed
than others in order to minimize deadweight loss.

At the empirical level.

however, we find that the optimal deviation from uniform taxation generates
welfare gains that are quite small relative to those generated by a move to
uniform taxation from a tax system like that prevailing in the U.S. before
1986.
All of the paper's welfare analysis is based on changes in steady State
utility.

A problem that has plagued such analysis in the past is that tax

but also
policy changes induce not only behavioral distortions
intergenerational transfers.

Without resorting to numerical simulation models

(as in Auerbach and Kotlikoff 1987) it

has

t been possible to distinguish

the steady State welfare changes arising from each source.

Selow, we develop

a simple technique for doing so, which at the same time provides insight into
the intergenerational incidence of taxation.

This technique should be of

general use for measuring efficiency gains in steady state models.

2.

The Model
There have been many previous approaches to the measurement of deadweight

loss from capital income taxation in models with a complex production
structure, but each lacks at least one attribute needed for our current
objectives.

In several papers, Diewert (1981, 1983, 1985) carefully analyzed

the deadweight loss caused by capital income taxes in a price—taking
production sector.

While quite useful in many contexts, particularly for

individual sectors of production or small open economies, such results were
nor intended and cannot be used to evaluate the consumption and savings
distortions induced by such taxes in general equilibrium.

Using a large—scale

numerical general equilibrium model, Fullerton and Henderson (1986,

1987) have

—4—

considered cspiral income tax distortions in s model with chsnging consumer
prices but have focused primsrily on static deadweight loss measures, with
saving not really considered and capital viewed as a primary factor of
production.

The model considered hers is a general equilibrium model in which

there is a complex structure of production and dynamic issues are incorporsted
in a consistent manner.
The notation used in describing the model is summsrized in Table

1.

We

consider the steady state of an overlapping generations closed economy in
which individuals live for two periods and there are two primary factors of
production, labor and land, each of which in homogeneous.

There are N

as
production sectors, with outputs produced using land and labor as well
intermediate goods and capital goods which are, themselves, produced by the N
sectors.

Each generation has a single representative household that supplies

labor in the first period of life and purchases the N commodities in each
period, subject to preferences defined over these 2N +

1

goods (including

labor).
The population is assumed to grow exogenously at rate n, and the supply
of land is also taken to be exogenous.

To make these two assumptions

consistent with the existence of a steady state, we must allow land to grow at
rate n as well.

This is accomplished in the model by aasuming that each

person entering old age receives n unite of land per existing unit, with this
receipt viewed as a lump—sum transfer.

Although not entirely satisfactory,

this seeme preferable to the more standard practices of omitting land entirely

or treating it as s type of reproducible capital.

returns to scale.

The residential tax rate may be viewed as a weighted average

argue that the former number is too low (homeowners do pay property taxes, for
example) end the letter too high (given the use of rental housing as s tea

compensation parameter.

The deadweight loss in this case equals 1.003 percent of the present
value of each individual's consumption.

This is smaller than other estimates

of the total deadweight loss of the tax system (e.g., Ballard, Shoven snd
Whslley 1985), for which there are several potential explanations, including
differences in modelling and parameter sasumptiona and the omission here of
several specific taxes (such as social security snd excise taxes).

However,

our msin concern here is with the magnitude of deadweight loss resulting from
nonuniform capital income taxation.
Setting all nonresidential capital income tsxes equal to the sversge rate
for these taxes, .280, causes a reduction in deadweight losa to .925 percent
of lifetime consumption, representing a gain of only .078 percent.

Such small

gains, which translate into a few billion dollars per year, are consistent

with earlier results.

Moving to fully uniform capital income taxes, including

—24—

residential capital, at an equal—revenue—yield rate of .222,

yields a further

efficiency gain of just .030 percent of lifetime consumption, perhaps a
billion dollara per year.

Thus, moving to uniform taxation yields a total

welfare gain of .108 percent of lifetime consumption.

Although these

efficiency gains are amall, an are the efficiency losses associated with small
changes in capital income tax rates.

For example, it would take a nearly 9

percentage point increase in the average tax rate on nonresidential capital to
offset the utility gain from shifting to uniform nonresidential capital
taxation.

This gain is of the rough. order of magnitude of the increase that

occurred with the introduction of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
Next, we consider the robuatnesa of our reaulta.

But it is not yet clear how

Even though the utility function chosen

are satisfied, the other two conditions are not.

This is quite

evident from Table 3, which reports the capital intensity of capital and
consumption goods.

As one would expect, housing is snich mre capital

intensive than other consumption goods.

Likewise, equipment is clearly the

most capital intensive capital good.
Indeed, it is possible to increase utility by deviating from uniform
taxation.

Starting from a position with all capital taxes equal to .22 (the

equal—yield uniform tax case considered above), a grid search algorithm
located a maximum utility Level at a tax rate of .16 on equipment, .23 on
nonresidential and residential structures, and .27 on inventories.
deviation is reasonably large,

While this

and is not surprising given the very high

capital intensity of equipment, the utility gain is small, about .005 percent
of consumption, or less than 5 percent of the size of moving from the initial
tax system to unifrom taxation.

Put another way, virtually all of the

increase in utility that can be achieved through the manipulation of capital
income taxes is achieved through moving to uniform taxation.
By coincidence, the case for uniform taxation is strengthened if only
nonresidential tax rates may be varied.

This is probably because the

residential tax rate being too low justifies heavier taxation of the capital
good used most heavily in building housing, equipment.

Starting from the

—26—

equal yield nonreaidential tax rate of .28, we find an optimum tax rate of .26
for equipment, .28 for nonreaidential structurea and .30 for inventories, with

an additional welfare gain of only .0005 percent of consumption.
Given the inevitable uncertainty that must exist about the correct model
specification, these results represent a fairly strong argument against
attempting to vary capital income tax rates from a uniform atructure for
"optimal taxation" purposes.

They indicate that the indirect effects of

capital taxation on capital allocation that work through capital goode prices
and consumption goode pricea are unimportant relative to the direct effects of
taxation considered in the existing literature.

Perhaps this should not be a

complete surprise, since the indirect price effects of capital coats are
attenuated by any specific capital good's amall ahate of value added and value

It is

9. Conclusion

The main result of this paper is that uniform capital income taxation is
almost certainly suboptimal from a theoretical standpoint because capital
goods enter the production process at different levels and through the
production of different commodities, but that uniform taxation is empirically
close in efficiency terns t
income taxes.

the "optimal" system of differential capital

This empirical result is unlikely to be sensitive to reasonably

parameter variations within the model, though one may conceive of other codeis
in which it migho not hold.

However, the benefits of deviations from oniform

taxation remain to be demonstrated.
Though the gains from a move to uniform taxation from a typical tax
system are not large, either, they do produce an efficiency gain that would be
offset only by a rise in capital income tax rates of several percentage
points.

This suggests that, in broad terms st least, the recent U.S. tax

reform is unlikely to have caused a major net change in long—run efficiency
through its changes in capital income taxation.

Aside from the three fixed capital goods, we allow nine inventory stucks,

This distinction permits each industry's inventories

to have a different commodity composition.

From this table, one may infer that virtually

virtually all structures are produced by this industry.

Given this,

one may

calculate the source of equipment production from the output of capital goods
by the remaining industries.
For inventories, a breakdown of inventories by stage of fabrication is
available only for manufacturing in the February 1986 Survey of Current
Business.

For these industries, we assumed that all finished goods and half

of work in process inventories were produced by that industry, while the

remaining work in process stocks and all new materials inventories had the
sama composition as the industry's intermediate inputs.

For the other seven

industries, we Simply assumed that all inventory stocks were produced by the
industry itself, equivalent to assuming then to be entirely finished goods.

To obtain an estimate of residential

land, we multiplied the 1980 and 1981 land to structures ratios for owner—
occupied housing provided by the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheets for the U.S.
Economy by our estimated residential capital stocks for each year.

This

calculation assumes that rental housing, representing about one—third of all
housing, has the same land to structures ratio as owner—occupied housing.

Solution of the Model

A

step that

ist

be taken before solution of the model is to expreaa all

flow variables in units consistent with the two—period overlapping generationa
model.

Letting T be the number of years per period (assumed to be 30

throughout), we multiply the flow vectors y and z and the rates r, n, a and
by T, and divide the atock—flow ratios K and

p

by T.

This change in unita

has no direct effect on the production side of the economy.

It is needed to

make sense of the assumption that the stock of national wealth is held for
second—period consumption.

In addition to the parameters given above, we specify the rate of
interest (and growth) and the Hessian and Slutaky matrices.

The parametera of

the Slutaky matrix are chosen to incorporate the constraint that second—period
consumption equal principal plus interest on the stock of national wealth.

We

also constrain expression (1) in the text to hold exsctly by starting with
observed consumption z and solving for y.

This is necessary because the

steady—state assumptions about rates of return and depreciation need not hold
exactly in any given year.

Industries 1—3 have virtually no final sales to

consumers, so for convenience consumption of these goods is set to zero.
Through the use of various substitutions, the change in the economy in
response to taxation reduces to two linear equations, based on the aavings

This is not a restrictive assumption, as one could specify a unique and

of the N
general production process for a capital good by making that good one

as a final consumption
outputs and assuming that such output ie not demanded
good or an intermediate input.
2.

Were thia not so, as it is not in reality, the value of old capital, per

of new capital
efficiency unit, would differ from that of a comparable unit
for tax reasons.

Such taxes are clearly important in considering the short—

run affects of tax reforms, as the effects of the 1981 and 1986 tax changes
and Hines 1987).
clearly demonstrate (Auerbach 1983, 1986, Auerbach

They may

alen affect the economy in the long run if changes in the relative value of
old to new capital, which one may view as a change in government assets, are
not offset by explicit debt policy (Auerbach and Kotlikoff 1987).

Such lung

run effects are attributable to changes in the intergenerational burden of
taxation rather than the magnitude of distortions.

In the analysis presented

below, such tax induced changes in capital gooda prices would automatically be
offset via government transfers, so that only the marginal tax rates matter
for long—run analysis.

Hence, it is not a further reetriction to focus only

on income taxes.

The idea that we might wish to tax less heavily capital at the bottom of
