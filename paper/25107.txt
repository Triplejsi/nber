Unlocking Amenities: Estimating Public-Good Complementarity

NBER Working Paper No. 25107
September 2018, Revised July 2019

ABSTRACT
Public goods may exhibit complementarities that are essential for determining their individual
value. Our results indicate that improving safety near parks can turn them from public bads to
goods. Ignoring complementarities may lead to i) undervaluing the potential value of public
goods; ii) overestimating heterogeneity in preferences; and iii) understating the value of public
goods to minority households. Recent reductions in crime have “unlocked” $5 billion in property
value in Chicago, New York and Philadelphia. Still over half of the potential value of park
proximity, over $10 billion, remains locked in.

Introduction

Economic theory leans heavily on the idea that goods may be complements in consumption.
While the joint demand for private goods has been studied extensively, little has been said about
the joint demand for public goods. Studying the joint demand for public goods is difficult as
individuals cannot purchase them directly, but only indirectly, such as through housing. To
the best of our knowledge, no study has estimated the joint demand for public goods in a
well-identified framework.1 This raises issues for public investment decisions as their value may
depend critically on complementary relationships.
In this paper, we study the complementarity between public safety and urban parks in major
U.S. cities. Our hypothesis is intuitive: parks are less valuable when they are dangerous. As
crime rises, the value of parks to nearby residents may disappear, and even become negative.
This idea is not new. In her seminal work, Jacobs (1961) devotes a chapter to the “use of
neighborhood parks,” where she argues that parks are not inherently equal in value. Without
formalizing the complementarity with crime, Jacobs writes:
Unpopular parks are troubling not only because of the waste and missed opportunities they imply, but also because of their frequent negative effects... their dangers
spill over into the areas surrounding, so that streets along such parks become known
as danger places too and are avoided (Jacobs, 1961, p. 95).2
The empirical evidence presented in this study supports this hypothesis. Safety “unlocks”
the value of parks. A corollary is that public safety is more valuable near parks. Thus, merely
displacing crime away from parks may have social value. Indeed, reducing crime near parks or
other public capital may be a boon to urban revival.3 Complementarity also implies that it can
be wasteful to equalize some public goods (parks) without equalizing others (safety).
Paying attention to public good complementarity has important methodological implica1

The closest analyses we know of consider the relationship between amenities and private consumption, Connolly
(2008) and Graff Zivin and Neidell (2014), examine the relationship between weather and time use, and thus
leisure as a good. Cuffe (2017) examines how rainfall influences museum attendance.
2
Through various examples and anecdotes, Jacobs proposes a kind of mechanism whereby parks that become less
active facilitate the perception of reduced safety as well as the production of crime (which presumably increase
together). Interestingly, Jacobs even suggests that the kind of variation in amenity benefits that she observes
might offer opportunities to the empiricist: “Philadelphia affords almost a controlled experiment on this point,”
and goes on to compare the successful Rittenhouse Square park with the dangerous Washington Square park.
Similar issues are recognized in the urban planning literature (Weiss et al., 2011).

tions for hedonic valuation (Banzhaf and Walsh, 2008), sorting behavior (Kuminoff et al.,
2013), quality-of-life determination (Albouy and Lue, 2015), and environmental distributive
justice (Banzhaf et al., 2018). Our findings highlight two related points. First, complementarities can affect the validity of estimates from hedonic valuation and other revealed preference
methods. Estimates from an unsafe area may not apply to a safe area and vice versa. Second, econometricians may attribute willingness-to-pay variation to differences in tastes, when
they may instead be due to differences in endowments. Indeed, economics is known to have a
long-standing ambivalence about explaining phenomena through variation in taste (Stigler and
Becker, 1977). Our evidence suggests that ignoring complementarity could lead the analyst to
infer that minority households, who tend to live in higher-crime areas, value safe parks less than
they do.
Our empirical analysis uses detailed crime and housing data in Chicago, New York and
Philadelphia from 2001 to 2016. In particular, we use 656,841 housing market transactions
located within 3/8 miles of 1,336 parks. We organize these transactions into “neighborhoods”
surrounding each park and assign each a local crime risk measure based on nearby homicides.
We employ several strategies to estimate the value of park proximity and, more importantly,
changes in that premium as a function of crime. As a foundation, we employ a neighborhood
spatial differences (NSD) design, comparing areas near parks with areas farther away. This relies on applying 1,336 fixed effects, one for each neighborhood.4 The difference in housing prices
near and far from parks identifies the average “park premium.” A second difference identifies the
complementarity using two sources of variation. In some specifications, the second difference
captures changes in the park premium over time as crime rates fluctuate, controlling for local
time trends. In others, the second difference relies upon spatial variation in the park premium
between areas that are safe or dangerous. We evaluate the sensitivity of these estimates to controls, including neighborhood-by-year fixed effects and socio-economic characteristics interacted
with both park proximity and local crime rates. We then examine instrumental variables (IV)
estimates that use city-level crime reductions to predict property-level changes in crime risk.
This helps remove potentially endogenous variation in crime changes from local neighborhood
dynamics.

4
This empirical design is similar to research by Espey et al. (2001) and Anderson and West (2006), although
we use multiple cities over long time periods. We show that effects are identified under relatively restrictive
assumptions in a base model that is consistent with prior work.

2

Estimates of the park premium for homes within roughly one block of parks remain stable at
around 5 percent in safe areas. This premium falls to zero at approximately double the average
crime rate in our sample, supporting the main hypothesis of complementarity. At higher levels
of crime, there is some evidence of a “park discount,” suggesting that parks may become a public
bad. Tests developed by Oster (2017) provide indirect evidence that both the interaction and
the main effect of parks in our main specifications are robust to omitted variables. Moreover,
the results are quantitatively consistent across the range of specifications, including the IV.
Our analysis indicates that without a park-crime interaction, an analysis of heterogeneity
in the park premium by neighborhood demographics might suggest that residents of minority
neighborhoods value parks less than non-minorities. When we include the park-crime interaction
term, we find no evidence of differences between the groups.
Complementarity affects the estimated benefits of parks and their distribution across neighborhoods. In total, our estimates indicate that park proximity alone contributes over $10.5
billion in total value to nearby homeowners across the three cities. However, on average, lowincome neighborhoods receive negative benefits from park proximity. These low income neighborhoods have the most to gain from crime reductions, which could unlock a large amount of
amenity value in local parks. If parks are made safer, even from displacement, the total value of
parks would roughly double. Much of the increase would accrue to low-income neighborhoods.
Since the beginning of our sample period, the amenity value unlocked through reductions in
crime accounts for roughly half of the current value.
Our estimates likely represent a lower bound on the total benefits of unlocked amenity value
for two reasons. First, the total value of parks is probably much larger than, but strongly
correlated with, the benefits of park proximity. Second, Banzhaf (2018) demonstrates that
estimates such as ours provide a lower bound welfare measure in settings with preferencebased sorting. We find little evidence that resident characteristics change with the park-crime
complementarity, though we cannot rule out changes in unobserved characteristics.
This paper addresses parallel, but mostly disparate strands of research in public goods
valuation. The first estimates the value of increases (Gamper-Rabindran and Timmins, 2013)
and reductions (Currie et al., 2015, Davis, 2004, Muehlenbachs et al., 2015) in environmental
amenities. Since the value of leisure-producing environmental amenities such as clean air (Chay
and Greenstone, 2005, Currie et al., 2015, Muehlenbachs et al., 2015, Ito and Zhang, 2016),

3

clean water (Keiser and Shapiro, 2017), and climate amenities (Albouy et al., 2016) depends
on the overall quality of outdoor experience in any locale, there is reason to believe that their
value may depend on levels of public safety. Many authors estimate the value of access to
open space — see Brander and Koetse (2011) for a meta-analysis — although their reliance on
cross-sectional variation raises concerns about bias from omitted variables.
A second strand estimates the value of public safety through housing prices. This literature
dates back to early efforts by Thaler (1978). Recent studies address measurement error and
omitted variables concerns to value the social cost of crime (Gibbons, 2004) as well as extensions
to the value of policing (Chalfin and McCrary, 2017, Di Tella and Schargrodsky, 2004), targeted
public safety and crime prevention programs (Donohue et al., 2013, Draca et al., 2011), and the
relocation of sex offenders (Linden and Rockoff, 2008). The present study focuses on the benefits
of crime reductions that operate through a complement. However, it raises important questions
for further research on the benefits of public safety. The tentative evidence suggests that crime
exhibits diminishing marginal damages in neighborhoods near parks. Taken literally, this hints
that it may be socially beneficial to concentrate crime if the total can be held constant.
In two articles on the topic, we find contradictory estimates of the relationship between parks
and crime using purely cross-sectional data. Anderson and West (2006) find crime associated
with higher values in Minneapolis, whereas Troy and Grove (2008) find crime associated with
lower values in Baltimore.5 Each of these studies relies on different samples and specifications,
making them difficult to reconcile.6 Besides framing the issue of public good complementarity
more generally, our estimates examine data across multiple cities and use variation across time
and space, allowing for a rich set of time-varying controls and the IV strategy.7
Section 2 below presents a theory of complementary public goods in a hedonic setting.
Section 3 describes our data. Section 4 examines functional form issues and presents graphical
evidence. Section 5 reports supporting regression evidence for a range of specifications. Section
5
Anderson and West (2006) estimates this relationship with a sample of 24,000 housing transactions and the
number of “serious crimes,” which includes thefts and assaults. Troy and Grove (2008) uses 16,000 transactions.
They use a measure of the incidence of robbery and rape. The paper states: “Murder was not chosen because
the numbers of these crimes are small,” which is true for a single year. They dismiss the use of assaults asserting
that these are often indoors and related to domestic violence.

Bowes and Ihlanfeldt (2001) finds that crime can affect property values near rail stations, another urban public
good.
7
This is not the first study to posit the importance of public safety for parks. Anderson and West (2006) and
Troy and Grove (2008) are good examples of empirical research that examines crime and open space. Troy and
Grove (2008) discuss some elements of the complementarity such as a threshold of public safety that is necessary
for positive valuation of urban parks.

A Simple Model of Public Good Complements

In principle, complementarity in public goods, e.g., warm weather and a community pool, are
no less important than between private goods, swimming trunks and goggles. An important
difference is that local public goods are bought indirectly through housing. This purchase is
developed in the model below.
Preferences are represented by a Cobb-Douglas function: the utility of person i in location
j is Uij = Qij y α x1−α , where y is the quantity of the housing good consumed, with price vj , x
is a numeraire good, and α ∈ (0, 1) is a fixed parameter. Qij gives the value of location j to
person i, which is log-linear in interacted amenities:


ln Qij = θP + θP H Hj Pj + θH Hj + ln ξj + ij

(1)

where Pj denotes the environmental amenity, Hj denotes the crime level, and ξj other commonlyvalued amenities. The parameter ij is an idiosyncratic taste shock for the neighborhood.
The parameters θP > 0 and −θH > 0 define the base elasticities of willingness-to-pay for
the environmental amenity and safety (minus crime), respectively. The interaction parameter
θP H describes the complementarity, which we predict to be negative. Alternatively, safety and

parks are complements. These terms may be arranged as θH + θP H Pj Hj + θP Pj to illustrate
how the cost of crime rises when the environmental amenity is higher.8
Denote our measure of crime, H̃j = Hj + aj , where aj captures measurement error. This

error adds to the unobserved amenity term: ξ˜j = ξj + θH + θP H Pj aj . Taking these shifts
into account, the indirect utility function is given by:

ln Uij = −α ln vj + θjP + θP H Hj Pj + θH H̃j + ξ˜j + ij
8

Strictly speaking, the marginal value of one amenity increases with respect to the other even without the
interaction in a Cobb-Douglas formulation. But this is not due to any kind of complementarity. Focusing on
the elasticity of the value makes the complementary relationship more plain. Complementary amenities are also
implied by the canonical Tinbergen model, described in Bartik and Smith (1987) and Ekeland et al. (2004), even
though they have only rarely been estimated.

interaction.

where β k = θk /α, k ∈ {P, H, P H}, ξj∗ = ξ˜j /α, and uij = (ij − ln Uij ) /α. This specification
predicts that β P > 0 and β H < 0. If parks and safety are complementary, then β P H < 0. This
linear model predicts that above a certain level of crime, a park becomes a public bad. If

then households will pay to live away from the park.9 As shown in Banzhaf (2018) for the case
of individual amenities, hedonic estimates that exploit exogenous changes in the level of one or
both public goods complements may shift an entire hedonic price function and identify a lower
bound on the Hicksian equivalent surplus.

Data and Descriptive Statistics

Our data are based on observations of housing transactions that vary in their proximity to
urban parks and in crime incidents reported in the neighborhood. We study Chicago, New
York, and Philadelphia, as they have a large number of parks as well as geo-coded, incidentlevel crime reports. For Chicago, these reports cover the period 2001 to 2016 and for New York
and Philadelphia, 2006 to 2016. These constitute the years of our sample.
The data on transaction prices and structural characteristics come from Zillow (2018). From
these data, we create controls for dwelling characteristics: log distance to the CBD, age of the
dwelling, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and dwelling type (i.e. single
and multifamily residences).10
We match each house with data on the socio-economic composition of residents living in the
9

The error term does include differences in the preference shock relative to utility. Thus, the framework may be
used to motivate a logit estimator based on how many people choose to live in an area based on its proximity to
a park and local safety. Such an approach would require a nuanced understanding of local housing supply. Since
we find little evidence of sorting or increases in population density, we focus on the hedonic analysis instead.
10
Dwelling characteristics come from the Assessor’s office and correspond to the most recent property assessment.

Census block and block group from the 2000 and 2010 Censuses, complemented by the 2011-15
American Community Survey (ACS). These include: population density; percentages of White,
Black, and Latino households at the block level; vacant and rented housing units at the block
level; and median age and median income at the block group level. We also match homes to
the total number of housing units in their census block for later benefit calculations.
Table 1 reports basic descriptive statistics for these variables. In all three cities, the raw
transaction prices of homes within 2/16ths of a mile of a park are higher than those slightly
farther away. The average property-level homicide risk is fairly similar across the cities, ranging from 1.39 in Philadelphia to 1.65 in Chicago. Note that areas with predominantly white
populations are strongly represented in all three cities and throughout the study period. While
the fraction of owner-occupied, multifamily units may appear high, this is not unusual for the
cities in our sample.

3.1

Urban Parks and Neighborhood Definition

We organize the housing transactions into neighborhoods, with each centered on a single park.
Parks are defined in our source (openstreetmap.org) as: “open, green area for recreation, usually
municipal, and are differentiated from other public/private open spaces such as: golf courses,
stadiums, nature reserves (which may not have public access), and marinas.”11 We use all parks
larger than 0.6 acres, providing 1,336 geo-coded urban parks across all three cities.
Each neighborhood contains the housing transactions within 3/8 miles of its park, aside
from transactions that are nearer to other parks. We then subdivide the transactions into bands


around the park that are 1/16 of a mile (≈ 100 meters) in width: Pik ≡ I 1/16×k≤djij <1/16×(k+1) ,
where djij is the distance between each house i to the closest neighborhood park j. Each of these
bands corresponds to the width of a typical block. We neatly summarize these bands using the
vector Pi ≡ [Pi1 , Pi2 , ..., Pi6 ].12 A house within a block may have a view. Within two blocks,
the park is still within earshot of loud sounds such as gunfire.
Figure 1 illustrates our neighborhood definition using a map of transactions within 3/8

11

See https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:leisure. We subdivide some of the largest parks, such as Central
Park in New York, Lincoln Park in Chicago and Fairmount Park in Philadelphia, in order to capture the effects
of crime in particular neighborhoods that they span.
12
In Chicago, most blocks are 1/16 of a mile in length, although many East-West blocks are 1/8 of a mile. In New
York, many blocks are approximately 1/2 of a mile north-to-south, and often up to 1/7 of a mile, east-to-west.
Central Philadelphia blocks are about 1/13 of a mile.

miles of the parks in Chicago. The transactions are colored according to their distance interval,
except that the third through fifth columns are colored uniformly. This reflects the evidence
shown below: houses in Pi3 through Pi5 do not appear to benefit from a park premium, while
those in Pi1 do. Houses in Pi2 seem to benefit weakly, and thus may be taken as secondary
evidence or excluded. Each point refers to a single transaction. The insert shows a close-up
view of the neighborhood around Marquette Park. While not an affluent part of Chicago, the
neighborhood still contains a large number of transactions. In total, our final data-set contains
656,841 transactions. Chicago and New York have almost equal numbers, while Philadelphia
has far fewer.13

3.2

Mapping Crime Risk at the Transaction Level

Our crime measure is based on crime incident reports. These data come from city police departments, provided by their Open Data Portal.14 We use these geo-located reports to calculate
a measure of crime risk at all locations for every city and year in the study period.
For clarity and comparability over space and time, we focus on homicide risk. Prior research
suggests that property and other types of crime are subject to greater reporting biases. Furthermore, property crime in particular can occur more frequently in neighborhoods with greater
amenities and wealth.15 Hence, we use “crime” and “homicides” interchangeably throughout the
paper.
Figure 2 illustrates the estimated homicide risk for Chicago. Darker-shaded areas indicate
higher homicide risk. To calculate homicide risk, we estimate the likelihood of a homicide at a
given property based on the crime incident reports. This likelihood is estimated using a bivariate
Gaussian kernel with a bandwidth of 2/8 of a mile on a 1/8 mile city grid, and normalized to
13

Figure 1 and Appendix Figures A.1 and A.2 illustrate the parks, bin definitions, and housing transactions in
each of the three cities.
14
For the City of Chicago the data are extracted from the Chicago Police Department’s CLEAR (Citizen Law
Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system and available through the Chicago Data Portal at https://goo.gl/
D8Vm82 New York City data from the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and available through NYC
Open Data portal at https://goo.gl/zGp8Z2. Philadelphia crime incidents come from the Philadelphia Police
Department and are available through Open Data Philly at https://goo.gl/gYR96r.
15
We analyze the robustness of our estimates to measures that include all crimes and discuss them with our main
results. Prior research illustrates substantial heterogeneity in the perception and valuation of different types
of crime and ambiguous effects of property crimes on housing prices. For example, Thaler (1978) finds that
property crime reduces housing prices, but Gibbons (2004) finds no effect of burglaries. Ihlanfeldt and Mayock
(2010) discuss the drawbacks of using total crimes as a crime risk measure. Using total crime implicitly assigns
the same weight to all crimes, putting too much weight on low-value crimes. As an alternative to homicide, we
use willingness-to-pay estimates from Chalfin and McCrary (2017) to construct a unitary measure of homicideequivalents. Homicide risk appears to provide a better signal of what areas are truly dangerous. These estimates
are much less precise, though they suggest qualitatively similar findings.

8

give the probability of a homicide per square mile. We use a three-year rolling window to help
smooth out short-term fluctuations. The narrow bandwidth and grid allow for fine distinctions
in crime rates even within neighborhoods. Taking into account the total number of homicides
in the city, Htc , our measure of homicide risk at property i in neighborhood j in year t is then
given by:
(Linear) Homicide Risk : hijt = E(hijt ) = pijt Htc

(4)

where pijt is the estimated probability of homicide at property i in year t. This yields the
expected number of homicides per square mile in year t at property i, E(hijt ) = hijt .16
Figure 3 plots trends in homicide rates per square mile for each of the cities during the study
period. All of the three cities have experienced substantial (>30 percent) declines in homicide
rates up to 2015, although Chicago’s rate shot up in 2016. The declines within cities were not
uniform across space. Examining both panels in Figure 2, it is possible to see that while most
areas in the city became safer, some became more dangerous.
Each transaction is matched to the measure of homicide risk that corresponds to its precise
location and time. Figure 4 plots the ratio of homicide risk within 1/8 of a mile of the park
to that in the rest of the neighborhood, from 1/8 to 3/8 of a mile. Most neighborhoods have
a density of homicide risk of less than 2 per year per square mile. In these neighborhoods, the
ratio is close to one. In more dangerous neighborhoods, crime risk is slightly higher near parks
when looking at the average across the study period.
Crime risk changes over the period were distributed rather uniformly across space. Homicide
risk did consolidate slightly in the three cities, though not by much. In the base year, we find
that 80 percent of the homicide risk was located in 12.6 percent of the land area. In the last
year of the sample, that fraction fell to 12.5 percent.

Visual Evidence and Functional Form

Below we provide visual evidence of the relationship between parks, crime, and transaction
prices. This evidence guides our choices of functional form of measures defined in section 2.
16

In Table 5, we consider measures that use the average homicide rate for the entire neighborhood around the
park as well as measures that exclude incidents in or within 1/8 of a mile of the park. Note that the incident
data does not measure crimes within parks, but at a street address on the perimeter of the park, usually at the
closest location to the incident. We also try different weighting schemes to construct our homicide risk measure.
Results are robust to alternative weights.

9

Visually, we examine prices by proximity to park, homicide risk, and their interaction by plotting
estimates from the following regression equation:

Vijt = Pi β P + Hijt β H +

X

Pik Hijt βkP H + Di β D + γj + ζtc + uijt

(5)

k

For park proximity, we use Pi , the park-distance bins mentioned above, which distinguish
properties that are typically a block apart. We use the estimates from this model to test for
evidence of a decaying park premium in our sample and also to determine whether properties
farther away from parks can be sensibly combined in a single comparison bin.
For homicide risk, we examine data grouped by bins of homicides, Hijt . However, interactions between distance bins and homicide risk bins are low in power and impractical for
regression tables. This motivates us to consider a continuous measure of homicide risk. We use
a non-linear (square root) transformation of risk for two reasons. First, the data generating
process for crime can be thought as a continuous Poisson process. Least squares regressions
are best suited to Gaussian processes. Brown et al. (2013) shows that if H follows a Poisson
√
distribution with mean λ, then 2 times the square root, H̃ = 2 H, is approximated by a
Gaussian distribution. We normalize this by the mean so the coefficients can be interpreted as
√ √
semi-elasticities: H̃ = 2 H( H)−1 . Second, households may experience diminishing returns
to safety. Once residents no longer consider their neighborhood safe, they may limit their time
outdoors such that additional reductions in safety do relatively little damage.17
The model includes a fixed effect for each neighborhood assigned to a park, γj . These fixed
effects form the basis of the NSD method that helps to control for unobserved factors that vary
between neighborhoods. It is based on the idea that properties a few blocks away from each
other are likely to be close substitutes. Including these fixed effects requires a large number
of observations, which fortunately our data provide. The controls also include 3 sets of time
indicators, ζtc , for each city-by-year combination. This takes into account the fact that cities
may exhibit different housing price cycles. Finally, the controls include dwelling characteristics,
Di , which do not vary over time due to our source.
Figure 5 plots variation in housing prices at different levels of homicide risk, comparing
homes located within 1/16 of a mile of a park, P1 , to properties 2 to 5/16 miles away, PA . The
horizontal axis uses a square root scale. There are two important features to note. First, at the

10

lowest risk levels, transaction prices for homes near parks are roughly 5 percentage points higher
than homes farther away from the same park. Second, this park premium disappears at higher
levels of homicide risk, supporting the hypothesis that the value of parks falls with crime. The
fitted lines come relatively close to the markers, illustrating that a square root transformation
fits the data better than other power transformations. As a result, we focus on the transformed
measure, H̃ijt , throughout the remainder of the analysis.18
Figure 6 plots distance to park along the horizontal axis using the full 6 bins in Pi . The model
interacts these with the transformed measure of homicide risk. The plot illustrates differences
in the park premium in areas with no homicide risk versus areas with high homicide risk (i.e.
9 annual homicides per square mile). With no risk, the model estimates a park premium that
decays with distance to the park. When risk is high, we see evidence of a park discount that also
decays with distance to the park.19 Furthermore, the effects of proximity to a neighborhood
park disappear after the 2nd distance interval, which justifies our choice to collapse the 3rd,
4th, and 5th bins into a single comparison group, PiA . Figure 1 shows PiA in red for Marquette
Park. This is equivalent to constraining 3rd, 4th, and 5th bins to have the same coefficient, or
using P̃i ≡ [Pi1 , Pi2 , PiA , Pi6 ], where PiA = Pi3 + Pi4 + Pi5 . Transactions in the outer bin, Pi6 ,
behave somewhat differently. In some cases, certain transactions in bin Pi6 are assigned to a
separate park, which raises a selection issue. Rather than include it in our comparison sample,
we separately estimate Pi6 as a nuisance parameter in our models.

18

We examine the fit of several linear and non-linear homicide measures in Appendix Table A.1. Estimates of the
complementarity are not much different across these different forms. Point estimates in all specifications decline
rapidly and are not statistically significant after the first interval when the block-level, time-varying controls
are added. Appendix Figure A.3 compares the fit of the linear vs square root measures, suggesting that the
linear measure may underestimate prices at low levels of homicide risk. Appendix Table A.2 compares estimates
using the linear measure of homicide risk. The linear estimates imply a smaller park premium and a somewhat
smaller percentage point reduction in prices per additional homicide within 1/16th mile of a park. In the Online
Appendix C we provide results using the simpler linear measure.

The discount is not strongly significant when we estimate individual effects for each distance bin. We provide
formal tests with greater statistical power in later sections.

Regression Analysis of Park-Safety Complementarity
Identifying the Park Premium and Park-Safety Complementarity

In this section, we specify our hypotheses and identification strategies using a regression equation
that builds on the NSD method introduced in equation (5):

Vijt = P̃i β P + H̃ijt β H + P̃i H̃ijt βkP H + Di β D + Xijt β X
X
P̃ki Xijt βkXP + H̃ijt Xijt β XH + γj + γjT × t + ζtc + uijt
+

(6)

k

This equation uses the abbreviated park-distance bins, P̃i , the (square-root) transformation
of homicide risk, H̃ijt , and introduces time-varying socio-economic controls for race, income,
tenure, unemployment, and population density Xijt , as listed in panel C of Table 1. Importantly,
we include interactions between these and the park and homicide variables. In addition, we
control for neighborhood-specific time trends, γjT × t.
Formally, the empirical design is centered around two hypotheses. The primary hypothesis
PH .
is that parks and safety are complements. This implies that β1P H < 0 and that βkP H > βk+1

In words, the negative park-crime interaction attenuates with distance from the park. The
P .
secondary hypothesis is that safe parks are goods. This means that β1P > 0 and that βkP ≥ βk+1

At zero homicide risk, the park premium for bin k is given by βkP ; with any positive level of
homicide risk, it becomes βkP + βkP H H̃ijt . If the value of parks can become negative at high
0 , it becomes β P + β P H H̃
enough levels of crime, then at that threshold H̃ijt
ijt = 0. This is
1
1

the threshold above which park access within a neighborhood does not confer a premium. It
is important to note that through the effects of complementarity, park value can be “unlocked”
0 . We later provide empirical estimates of “unlocked” value in highboth above and below H̃ijt

crime and low-crime neighborhoods in our sample. Neither hypothesis requires estimating the
causal effect of crime on property values outside of the interaction.
In order to obtain unbiased estimates of the park-crime interaction, β P H , the error term
must be linearly orthogonal to the park-crime interaction, conditional on all of the control
variables, the main effects of park and crime, and their interactions with the controls. To state
this precisely with the interaction terms, let L denote the linear projection20 , and omit obvious
20

This requires a standard linearity in parameters assumption, as in Wooldridge (2010).

12

subscripts and tildes to write:

L (u|P H, P, H, X, P X, HX, W ) = L (u|P, H, X, P X, HX, W )

(7)

where W = [D, γj , γjT × t, ζtc ] denotes the control variables not interacted with parks or crime.
This condition allows all of the regressors in equation (6) to have biased coefficient estimates,
except for the park-crime interaction. The interactions of the controls with park proximity, and
separately with crime, help to control for other sources of complementarity or interactions that
may influence property prices.21 For example, as X includes household income, the interactions
control for whether parks are less valuable in areas with poorer residents. Since the socioeconomic variables, X, are potentially endogenous in the sense that they could also be outcomes
of changes in crime, it is important to see estimates that exclude as well as include these
variables. We will show that estimates of β P H and β P are not sensitive to their inclusion.
For estimates of the park premium, a parallel condition applies:

L (u|P, H, X, HX, W ) = L (u|H, X, HX, W )

(8)

Homicide risk, socio-econoomic characteristics, their interaction, and the other non-park variables must absorb any additional variation due to unobserved factors that might bias the park
premium estimate. Bias in β P results from unobservables that are correlated with the price
effects of parks and are orthogonal to homicide risk. For example, unobserved property-level
characteristics could result in differences in the price premium. The identification assumption
for β P is likely to be stronger than for β P H , since the set of unobserved characteristics that are
fixed or otherwise orthogonal to crime is broader than those that vary with local changes in
crime.22
As we substantiate below, the condition for identifying the park premium may be less demanding than a similar condition for the direct effect of crime. This could be due to the fact that
parks are distributed more evenly than homicide risk. Visually, this can be seen by comparing
parks shown in Figure 1 and the homicide measure in Chicago seen in Figure 2. As mentioned
earlier, 80 percent of the homicide risk we measure is concentrated on just 13 percent of land.
21

In practice, the X variables are demeaned so as not to change the estimated coefficient under this condition.
Technically the condition below must hold, but this includes various interactions with the park premium:
L (u|P, H, P H, X, P X, HX, W ) = L (u|H, P H, X, HX, W ).

22

13

The identifying assumption for β P H is violated by confounds that affect the value of park
proximity within a few blocks and simultaneously vary with homicide risk.23 We distinguish
between three types of omitted variables concerns by decomposing the error term in equation
(5) into: uijt = φijt + µijt . Whereas µijt is idiosyncratic and unrelated to the interaction term
after conditioning on the controls, φijt includes unobservables that are correlated with homicide
risk and affect the park premium:

φijt = υjt + σi + χijt
(2)

(1)

(3)

(1) υjt includes time-varying unobservables between neighborhoods; (2) σi includes time-invariant,
property-level characteristics, within neighborhoods; (3) χijt includes all other time-varying unobservables that may produce bias. Accordingly, we report estimates from the core NSD model
and then evaluate their robustness to possible biases. We include neighborhood-specific time
trends and neighborhood-by-year fixed effects to help address between-neighborhood differences
(1). We address time-invariant property characteristics (2) using a true repeat sales estimator,
based on a small sample, and a “matching” repeat-sales estimator based on a larger sample.
We address time-varying unobservables that may operate within neighborhoods (3) using the
socio-economic controls and their interaction. We also consider an IV that uses city-level variation in crime rates, which identifies the complementarity assuming that city-level fluctuations
are exogenous to the differential changes that occur within a tight perimeter around parks.

5.2

Neighborhood Spatial Differences

Table 2 reports estimates from model (6), with successive levels of controls. We report effects
for the closest 0 to 1/16th distance-to-park interval, β1P , as well as the second, 1 to 2/16ths
mile interval, β2P , since the latter also shows some evidence of a park premium. The reference
category in this specification is the 2 to 5/16ths mile distance interval.
Column 1 reports estimates from a specification that ignores the interaction between park
access and homicide risk, which the remaining columns include. This coefficient on park proximity, β P , refers to a mean effect across all risk levels. All specifications include neighborhood
fixed effects, city-by-year fixed effects, and observable dwelling characteristics. Specification 3

In Appendix B, we derive the conditions that identify the complementarity β P H and β P .

adds time-varying socioeconomic controls, 4 adds neighborhood time trends, and 5 adds the
socio-economic control interactions.
Column 1 suggests that homes within roughly one block of parks sell for approximately 3
percentage points more than those farther away. When the interaction is included, the premium,
now for safe parks, rises to roughly 5 percentage points. This relates directly to the main result
in the paper, which is seen in the fourth row: the park premium falls with crime, β P H < 0.
Across specifications, the magnitude is 1.2 to 1.3 percentage points for each increase in the
transformed risk measure. With high enough risk, −β P /β P H ≈ 4.1 (standard error= 1.0), the
park premium becomes zero. De-transforming the risk variable, this corresponds to almost 4
homicides per square mile annually. Failure to account for the park-crime complementarity
would underestimate the premium for safe parks by 35 percent. It is also worth noting that the
interaction is negative for the second park bin, albeit smaller and imprecise. While this estimate
must be tempered by its imprecision, it further supports the hypothesis of complementarity.
The core estimates are largely stable across columns 2 through 5. As alluded to above,
the main park and park-crime interaction effects change far less than the coefficient on crime.
Moving from column 2 to 3, we see that the latter is roughly halved with the addition of socioeconomic controls, while the interaction term hardly changes and the main park effect falls by
one tenth. Neighborhood time trends added in column 4 further reduce the crime estimate, but
slightly increase the park and park-crime estimates. Column 5, which saturates the model with
the socio-economic interactions, hardly moves the estimates any further. While the time-varying
controls could introduce simultaneity since they are potential outcomes of crime changes, we
find that including them does not affect our main results.
The estimates in Table 2 may still be subject to omitted variables that vary within neighborhoods. For instance, reductions in local crime could coincide with capital improvements made
in nearby parks. To consider the potential effects of omitted variables on our NSD estimates,
we adopt the method developed by Altonji et al. (2005) and Oster (2017).24 In particular,
Oster (2017) introduces the coefficient of proportionality, δ. This statistic captures the effect of
additional control variables on the coefficient of multiple correlation, R2 . If the main estimates
are not sensitive to including observed variables that explain variance in the outcome, then the
logic is that they are unlikely to be sensitive to remaining unobserved variables. δ ≥ 1 indicates
24

These estimates also rely upon the functional form that we have defined for the amenity value of parks as a
function of distance.

15

that unobserved variables would need to be stronger confounders than the controls we consider
in order to drive our estimate to zero.
The tests proposed in Oster (2017) depend on an assumption about the maximum possible
R-squared that could be achieved in a model that accounts for the remaining unobservables,
Rmax . It is unlikely that Rmax = 1 in our model, since our housing price data contain a great
deal of variance that is not related to with the underlying value of neighborhood amenities. Oster
suggests as a rule of thumb using Rmax = 1.3R̃2 , where R̃2 is the R-squared from the model
with a full set of controls.25 This rule may be too demanding given that housing transaction
data may have considerable noise and idiosyncrasies.
In Table 3, we report δ for a range of values for Rmax using all of the control variables
introduced in columns 2 to 5. We find that the δ values for the park-crime interaction are at
least 8 times higher than the main effect of crime. In other words, the former is only one-eighth
as sensitive to additional controls as the latter. The values of δ that correspond to main effect
of parks are nearly as high as the interaction. In absolute magnitude, the interaction coefficient
meets the condition δ > 1 even for the highest value of Rmax = 1.3, while that for parks
is right at the cusp. Indeed, this criterion is demanding: Oster (2017) finds that 55 percent
of non-experimental findings published in top journals would not meet it. Nevertheless, the
overall robustness of both the main park and park-crime interaction suggests that the spatial
differencing method is quite effective at controlling for unobservables related to parks, if not for
crime (Druckenmiller and Hsiang, 2018).

5.3

Robustness Checks over Space and Time

Table 4 reports estimates with even more flexible controls for neighborhood differences over
time. Column 1 replicates column 5 from above, which includes 1,336 neighborhood-specific
time trends. Column 2 allows for time trends to differ for properties near parks versus farther
away. This can account for differing trends in park premia over local booms and busts. Column
3 introduces neighborhood-by-year fixed effects, controlling flexibly for time-varying differences
between neighborhoods. Neither of these specifications weakens the park-crime interaction.
The checks in Table 5 use measures of homicide risk averaged across the entire neighborhood
25

The rule-of-thumb Rmax = 1.3R̃2 is derived form her analysis on 65 results from published papers. The 1.3
cutoff is a value that allows 90 percent of the experimental results examined to ‘survive’, meaning that the
unobservables explain less of the variation in the outcome than the observables.

16

or over the entire sample period. The final measure excludes crime incidents that occur within
1/8 mile of parks. Not surprisingly, the longer time-average in column 2 produces slightly larger
interaction effects. This could result from smoothing annual variation in homicides.
With the neighborhood-level measure, the estimates exclude variation in homicide risk across
properties within neighborhoods. The coefficient on the park-crime interaction in column 3 is
smaller than in 1, likely reflecting attenuation from increased measurement error, but is not
significantly different from those reported in Table 2. The measure in column 4 uses only timeinvariant variation in homicide rates between neighborhoods. Thus, it cannot estimate the main
effect of homicides while including neighborhood fixed effects. In contrast, the repeat-sales
estimator below relies exclusively on time variation and therefore cannot estimate the timeinvariant effect of park proximity. The result in column 5 is about as strong as the estimate in
column 3, suggesting that the estimates are not driven by homicides occurring within parks.

5.4

Repeat-Sales Estimators

One concern with the estimates above is that properties in high-crime areas could possess
unobserved characteristics that differ from those farther away. For instance, houses near safe
parks may have larger windows, while those in dangerous areas may not. If so, then the
estimates in Table 2 could be confounded by complementarities between parks and certain
housing characteristics. To address the effects of unobserved fixed property characteristics (σi ),
Table 6 compares the estimate in column 3 from Table 2 with specifications that rely upon
repeat-sales estimation within the NSD framework.
Column 2 reports estimates from a repeat-sales-as-matching estimator developed by McMillen
(2012). It generates a counterfactual by matching home sales in the first year of the sample
to properties in each subsequent year.26 However, the interaction effect remains significant at
almost the same magnitude, though less precisely estimated.
Column 3 provides estimates from a standard repeat-sales model that uses a much smaller
sample (about one quarter) of properties that sell more than once during the study period.
These estimates rely completely on time variation in prices, such that the value of park proximity cannot be estimated. In contrast to the estimates from the matched model, the main
26

Samples for the repeat-sales-as-a-matching estimator and the true repeat sales were constructed using the
McSpatial R package (McMillen, 2013). Park proximity is an observed characteristic and used as a control, but
because the sample is properly balanced, it is not significant. So that coefficient drops out of this model.

17

estimated effect of homicide risk is closer to zero, possibly due to reduced variation in the subsample. Despite this reduction in variation, the park-crime interaction effect remains precise
and significant.27

5.5

City-Level Crime Instrument

A remaining concern regarding the estimates reported in Tables 2 and 6 is that neighborhoodlevel dynamics may cause the park premium to rise as crime falls, for reasons that the controls
do not account for. For instance, nearby public housing demolitions could act as a confounding
variable by lowering local crime while improving the view of park-side properties.28
To address this, we develop an IV strategy that uses changes in crime at the city-year level
to estimate effects on the park-safety complementarity within neighborhoods. This IV predicts
local crime levels using changes in the crime rate at the city level, allocating those changes in
proportion to the share of crimes observed at the beginning of the sample. It is similar to the
shift-share IV estimator developed by Bradbury et al. (1982) and Bartik (1991) for non-crime
measures, and examined by Goldsmith-Pinkham et al. (2018) and Borusyak et al. (2018). The
city-year changes that motivate this instrument are seen in Figure 3. Much of the variation
in local homicide risk can be attributed to declines in aggregate homicide rates in these cities.
Indeed, Pope and Pope (2012) argue that much of the variation in city-level homicide in the U.S.
is explained by aggregate shifts occurring across the country rather than by local socio-economic
changes.
We define the instrument formally by denoting the total annual homicides in a city in year
t as Htc . Altering slightly our previous notation, we define pij0 as the probability of a homicide
in property i in neighborhood j in the base year 0. Thus, the predicted expected number of
homicides at each location i is
IV
c
Hijt
= pij0 H−jt

(9)

To calculate the base probabilities, we use the first two years of the sample, which excludes
them from the regression analysis.29 To avoid any mechanical upward bias in the instrument,
c
the measure H−jt
omits homicides occurring in the same neighborhood j.
27

If homeowners expect additional changes in crime, then our estimates may be biased as shown by Bishop and
Murphy (2015). However, recent crime trends appear to deviate from historical trends in the last few years. This
makes it difficult to construct a forecast that would credibly match expectations of homebuyers.
28
See Aliprantis and Hartley (2015) and Diamond and McQuade (2019) for related literature.

We use homicide data for 2001-2002 for Chicago, and 2006-2007 for NYC and Philadelphia as our base period.

In this NSD+IV framework (“Neighborhood Spatial Differencing with Instrumental Variables”), changes in property-level crime are instrumented by city-level variation while also conditioning on neighborhood fixed effects and time trends. The exclusion restriction in this model

By conditioning on neighborhood fixed effects and time trends, the NSD+IV framework mitigates concerns about the endogeneity of initial crime shares (Goldsmith-Pinkham et al., 2018,
Borusyak et al., 2018). In identifying the park-crime complementarity, the IV strategy differs
from other shift-share approaches by relying on the effects of city-level (i.e., market-level) shifts
on within-neighborhood differences.
Table 7 reports the results of an uninteracted model in column 1 and the interacted model in
columns 2-4.31 Consistent with the trends illustrated in Figure 3, the first stage results of the IV
regression in Table 7 indicate that city-level changes in homicide risk predict local changes quite
well. For every unit increase in annual homicides at the city level, we find a corresponding 0.45
increase at the neighborhood level. Under simplifying assumptions, this implies that roughly
45 percent of local homicide variation is driven by city-wide trends.
Table 8 provides estimates from five specifications of the NSD+IV model. The NSD+IV
estimates for the safe park premium and the interaction are both similar to corresponding spec-

ifications from the NSD model without instruments in Tables 2 and 4, adding various time
controls. In fact, Wu-Hausman tests fail to reject differences between comparable specifications
of the NSD and IV+NSD models in all five specifications. The IV estimate for the complementarity is larger and less precise when parks and time trends are interacted. While the identifying
variation in the IV has its limits, overall the estimates are stable in specification 2, 3, and 5. The
park-crime complementarity is slightly larger, while the main effect of (safe) parks is slightly
smaller. Combining the two, the homicide level at which the park premium reaches zero here
at −β P /β P H ≈ 3.7 (s.e.= 0.8), implying roughly 2.3 homicides per square mile.

5.6

Additional Checks and Mechanisms

The exclusion restriction in our NSD+IV model is not directly testable. It would be violated
if the instrument is correlated with changes in other public goods near parks. We examine
the relationships between the instrument and block-level unemployment rates in Table B.1 and
zip-level restaurant establishments in Table B.3. These tests indicate that the instrument is not
correlated with these outcomes.
The results in Table B.2 indicate that city-level changes in crime do not predict different
effects on within-neighborhood changes in crime near versus far from parks. This finding reinforces our interpretation of our IV estimates as capturing the price effects of safety changes near
parks as opposed to changes in relative safety near parks. In Table B.4, we test the robustness
of our IV estimates to lags in the initial shares of homicide risk by omitting the first 5 years
of housing transactions in each city.32 Our estimates become slightly larger, likely as a result
of the sampling restriction, but are not significantly different from the estimates using the full
sample of data. Changes in expenditures on new equipment or community programs could
occur simultaneously with reductions in crime and confound estimates of the complementarity.
Estimates reported in Appendix Table A.4 indicate that estimates for the park premium and
the complementarity are robust to controls for changes in annual public expenditures on parks
across three regions delineated by the Chicago Parks Department.33
We also implement checks that are related to park use. Most parks are frequented less and
32

This tests the sensitivity of our estimates to assumptions about the within-neighborhood distribution of initial
homicide risk.
33
Data come from publicly available annual budget appropriations documentation for the City of Chicago: https:

in north, central and south regions of the City during the years 2011-2017.

often closed at night, potentially magnifying the effect of the complementarity with daytime
crime. Estimates presented in Appendix Table A.5 show that park-crime interaction when using
daytime crime is slightly stronger in the NSD+IV specification.34 We also examine heterogeneity in effects across different sized parks by dividing parks into quartiles of size.35 The estimates
illustrated in Appendix Figure A.4 indicate that effects of the proximity and the complementarity are greater for large parks. In fact, the park premium for small parks is insignificant, albeit
imprecise.36

6.1

Endowment Heterogeneity, Preferences, and Selection
Disentangling Complementarities from Taste Heterogeneity

The findings reported above indicate that differences in public good endowments may change
how households value complementary public goods. These endowments are often correlated
with household characteristics. In that case, valuation models could mistake heterogeneity in
the effects of public good endowments for differences in household tastes. Indeed, researchers
have modeled differences in preferences across demographic groups extensively, e.g., Bayer et al.
(2007). In the current setting, researchers could infer that residents in high-crime neighborhoods
have weaker tastes for parks, when lack of safety may better explain this difference.37
The results presented in Table 9 explore whether the park premium varies by neighborhood
demographic composition. These regressions interact the park premium with share of residents
that are either African American or Latino. We then consider how robust these results are to
including park-crime complementarity. Without the complementarity, the results in column 1
suggest little to no park premium in majority African-American neighborhoods. However, when
the complementarity is included in column 2, the difference becomes statistically insignificant.
34

Estimates are not different in the regular NSD model.
Presumably, larger parks are more valuable. Thus, both the park premium and the interaction should be
stronger around larger parks. In Chicago, parks in the fourth quartile (above 75th percentile) have a minimum
size of 4.83 acres, in New York 4.18 acres, and 10.88 acres in Philadelphia.
36
We implement two additional robustness tests to evaluate the effects of anomalies in our sample and crime
variable as a robustness check. Appendix Table A.3 shows that results remain unchanged when we drop 2016 to
exclude the spike in homicides in Chicago in that year. Appendix Table A.4 reports estimates using the measure
of homicide equivalent risk that includes all crime types, weighted by existing estimates of WTP from (Chalfin
and McCrary, 2017). Effects are less precisely estimated in this model and possibly affected by attenuation bias
from misreporting of minor crimes, though the magnitudes cannot be ruled out using the confidence intervals
around our main estimates.
37
Other factors, such as housing market discrimination Christensen and Timmins (2018), can also contribute to
differences in the hedonic estimates for local amenities such as parks.
35

21

A similar pattern emerges for Latino neighborhoods in columns 3 and 4. All interactions are
included in column 5, which replicates the same column in Table 2.
These results suggest a caution. Heterogeneity that could easily result in inferences about
differences in tastes could alternately stem from complementary endowments.38

6.2

Household Selection and Welfare Effects

Improvements in neighborhood safety may influence house prices not just by offering greater
direct benefits, but also by affecting the composition of the neighborhood. For example, as
safety improves, more affluent households may locate near urban parks. So could households
with stronger tastes for open space.
Banzhaf (2018) illustrates that if the types of people buying homes change, then hedonic
estimates provide the exact willingness to pay for amenities only under a restrictive set of
assumptions. When private endowments and preferences of buyers are related to changes in
amenities, Banzhaf establishes that hedonic estimates identify a lower bound on the Hicksian
equivalent surplus associated with the amenity improvement.39
In order to examine changes in neighborhood composition, we examine the socio-economic
characteristics used before as controls. This involves estimating an equation similar to those in
prior sections:

Xbjt = P̃i β P + Hbjt β H + P̃i Hbjt β P H + γj + ζtc + ubjt

(11)

where Xbjt measures the socio-economic characteristic for block (or block group) b, in neighborhood j in year t. The right-hand-side terms are those described in equation (6).40
Table 10 reports the results of this exercise. As there are eight different characteristics, the
significance of each variable must be adjusted for multiple hypotheses tests. Thus, in addition
38

Economists have long asserted that researchers should, in principle, not look to differences in tastes to explain
behavior (Stigler and Becker, 1977, Silberberg and Suen, 2000). Indeed, tastes are difficult to measure, and
(behaviorist) choice models are not suited for providing testable predictions along taste lines.
39
We note that despite the fact that illustrations in Banzhaf (2018) make use of a difference-in-difference setup,
this main result generalizes across a large class of empirical models that satisfy a conditional independence
assumption. In this class, exogeneous changes in an amenity are identified could be simultaneous with changes
in buyer characteristics.
40
Our measures of demographic characteristics are annualized by interpolating the matched census blocks and
block groups from the 2000, 2010 census, and the 2011-15 ACS. Population and population-by-race are obtained
at the block level whereas median income and median age at the block group level, which is the finest geography
that they are available.

22

to standard single-hypothesis p-values, the table reports p-values that control for rates of false
discovery (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). In this case, the standard NSD estimates suggest
no significant change in local household characteristics. This suggests that most of the benefits
of the park-safety complementarity accrue to households who resemble prior local buyers.
In the IV specification, two significant park-crime results do emerge. A one-unit decrease in
homicide risk is associated with a 0.7 percentage point increase in the share of White households
living near parks. We observe a similar decrease in the African-American share. Taking into
account the main effect, a one-point decrease in risk raises the percentage of White households
by 10.7 points.41
Given these magnitudes and the IV estimates from Table 8, we can calculate changes in
willingness-to-pay even in the most extreme case where African American households place zero
value on parks regardless of homicide risk. These calculations indicate that increases in the
white share could account for up to about one eighth of the estimates of the park premium
and the park-safety complementarity.42 We note that this calculation reflects an upper bound
that assumes extreme differences in group-specific valuation, which are not supported by the
empirical evidence reported in the prior section. The estimates in Table 9 do not find evidence
of differences in the premium for safe parks in neighborhoods with greater shares of African
Americans.
We cannot rule out change in willingness-to-pay that results from unobserved changes in
buyer preferences and therefore interpret our estimates as a lower bound welfare measure.
However, we find that observed changes in neighborhood composition are either statistically
insignificant or economically small.

41

This estimate conservatively assumes that all changes in the demographic composition recorded by the Census/ACS are homeowners/buyers.
42
This calculation treats the estimated park premium as a population-weighted average of the valuations of three

P 0
groups: (non-Latino) whites, African Americans, and everyone else: β P = βw
sw + βbP s0b + 1 − s0w − s0b β P ,
and that other groups (i.e. Asians and Latinos) exhibit the average willingness-to pay. Population shares from
b
the Census and reported in Table 1 indicate that sw
0 = 0.56 and s0 = 0.14. As an extreme example, we let
P
African Americans place no value on parks βb = 0 or no value on homicide reductions near parks βbP H = 0. In
this scenario, white households must value parks 25 percent more than the estimated average to balance each
term. This yields the following calculations for the willingness-to-pay of white buyers for park proximity and the

Valuing Park Proximity with Complementarity

Accounting for complementarity can change estimates of the aggregate benefits of public goods,
and even more dramatically, how those benefits are distributed. We stress that these estimates
only capture the value of park proximity for nearby residents.

7.1

Implications of Complementarities for Valuation and Unlocking Value

To calculate the implied value of park proximity in our 3 cities, we apply the estimates from
columns 5 and 6 of Table 8 to all of the housing units reported in the Census.43 The calculations
take median property values at the census block group level from the 2015 ACS, which provides
a conservative estimate.44 We examine heterogeneity across three income groups. The estimates
in panel A of Table 11 ignore the park-crime complementarity, while those in panel B include
it.
The results in panel A indicate that the aggregate value of park proximity is just over $9
billion. Most of the value is realized in New York, as it has more, higher-valued homes. The
estimates that account for the complementarity in panel B indicate a value of just under $11
billion. This number is greater because safer neighborhoods have more valuable properties and
because the greater park premium is multiplied by those values.
The value of parks in high-crime neighborhoods is estimated to be positive when complementarity is ignored, but negative when complementarity is considered. Thus, the value of
public capital is lower in these areas. This has a distributional implication, since the results in
Table 11 indicate that the same is largely true for low-income neighborhoods.
Estimates in panel C report the total potential value of park proximity if the homicide
risk near parks was reduced to zero. This does not imply eradication of crime altogether, since
crime reduction near parks could be achieved through targeted safety programs or displacement.
Panel D reports the difference with panel B. If park areas were made safe, formerly high-crime
areas would receive over $2.5 billion in park-proximity value. The net gain, starting from a park
discount almost as large, would be just under $5 billion. In low-income neighborhoods, the gain
43

Appendix Table A.6 provides separate estimates for each of the cities in our sample. F-tests suggest no difference
in the estimates across cities.

housing units in each census block group affected by the premium.

would be roughly as large, at just over $5.3 billion.
Low-crime and high-income neighborhoods would also see large improvements. This results
not only from the higher property values, but also from the estimated functional form, which
implies an increasing return to safety near parks. In total, these calculations suggest that there
is more than $10.5 billion of value in park proximity that could be unlocked. This is roughly
equal to the current realized value. Half of this value is “locked in” high-crime or low-income
neighborhoods.
To put these numbers in context, the operating and capital expenditures on these parks were
$0.5 billion, $1.7 billion, and $0.1 billion, in Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia, respectively.
Total expenditures were $2.3 billion across the cities.45 Capitalizing these values using a discount
rate of 4 percent (a typical mortgage rate) results in a net present value of $58 billion. The
realized value of simply living within one block of a park, as opposed to four, is about one-sixth
of this value. The potential value is one-third. Thus, a policy that moves all crime just a few
blocks away from parks could be worthwhile if it costs less than an additional sixth of current
park budgets.
A second implication of the estimates results from the fact that a considerable amount of
park value has already been unlocked through the reductions in crime observed across the period
of our sample. Table 12 reports these values, separating neighborhoods that became safer from
those that became more dangerous. Our results show that about half of current park-proximity
value was unlocked during this period. This occurred primarily in New York and Chicago.

Conclusion

This study presents possibly the strongest evidence to date on the complementarity between
two public goods: urban parks and public safety. Across a wide array of neighborhoods, homebuyers pay more to live near parks when they become safe. This phenomenon is illustrated
by comparing homes within the same neighborhood and is robust across a range of empirical
models that control for potential neighborhood-level confounds.
Our main findings also imply that while safe parks are public goods, unsafe ones can become
public bads. In fact, lack of safety appears to have locked up much of the value of existing urban

parks. This finding is important for policy makers and environmental justice advocates. Based
on principles of categorical equity, some might endorse providing equal access to open space
in safe and unsafe areas alike. Yet, to those in unsafe areas, such access may provide little
benefit. On the other hand, the present estimates imply that the value of reducing crime varies
substantially, even within local communities. Targeted investments in public safety through park
design, “hot spot policing,”“safe passage” programs, or other methods could unlock considerable
value simply by displacing crime. While on average such displacement appears to be beneficial,
it could risk affecting other public good complementarities that are not examined in this study.
Further research on complementarity and other settings is certainly warranted.
The results on the main effect of crime independent of park proximity are far less conclusive
and are peripheral to our thesis. However, our findings do point to several directions for further
research. First, the value of other forms of public capital, such as public transit, may be similarly
reduced by crime. Second, the finding that crime exhibits diminishing marginal costs deserves
further attention, as they imply that concentrating crime geographically may be Kaldor-Hicks
efficient. Third, there may be conditions under which parks contribute to or detract from the
production of crime. Unsafe areas may benefit more from additional “eyes on the street” from
residents inside nearby buildings or targeted safety programs (Jacobs, 1961, McMillen et al.,
2019). Open spaces may reduce such protections, particularly at night.

Philadelphia (2006-2016) from Zillow (2018). Dependent variable is ln(Housing Transaction Price), Park within 1/16 mile is
an indicator for sales within 1/16 mi. of a park, Park 1 to 2/16 mile is an indicator for sales between 1/16 mi. and 2/16
mi. of a park, Homicides Risk denotes the yearly number of expected homicides per square mile at the Property level. This
√ p −1
variable is defined using the following transformation: (H̃ = 2 H
(H
). The reference category in this specification
includes properties between 2 and 6/16ths miles away. Dwelling characteristics include: log distance to the CBD, age of the
dwelling and its square, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and dwelling type (i.e. Single, Multi Family
Residence). Specifications also include indicators for dwellings with missing characteristics. Results are robust to restricting
the sample to dwellings with complete data. Socio-economic controls include the following census block and block group
socio-economic variables linearly interpolated yearly from the 2000 and 2010 Censuses, and the 2011-2015 ACS: population
density, proportion of blacks, proportion of latinos, proportion of vacant housing units and of rented units at the block level;
and median age, median income and unemployment rate at the block group level. Neighborhood is defined using a 3/8 mile
radius around a park. Standard errors clustered at the neighborhood level are in parentheses.

Notes: Sample includes a interpolated yearly series of socio-economic characteristics from the 2000, 2010 Censuses and the 2011-15 ACS at block level. All specifications include
neighborhood fixed effects and year fixed effects. Neighborhood refers to the 3/8 miles radius around a park. Standard errors clustered at the neighborhood level are in parentheses.
Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) adjusted p-values in brackets.
Specifications also include controls for park proximity between 1 and 2 16th miles and it’s interaction with Homicide Risk, which we omit for clarity of exposition as these coefficients
are never statistically significant.
* Significant at 10% level; ** significant at 5% level; *** significant at 1% level according to Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) adjusted p-values.

Notes: Estimates of the value of parks for each city are based on the number of units within 1/16
miles of a park and the median value from the 2011-15 ACS and our estimates from Table 8, column 4.
We calculate the expected number of homicides in a neighborhood by year and classify them as: Low
Homicide Risk: less than one expected homicide by year; Medium Homicide Risk: more than one and
less than three expected homicides per year; High Homicide Risk: more than three expected homicides
per year. We divide neighborhoods based on the median neighborhood income from the 2000 Census
and classify them using city-specific income terciles.

Notes: Estimates of value of parks for each city are based on the
number of units within 1/16 miles of a park and the median value and
our estimates, as described in Table 11. Using the expected number of
neighborhood homicides, we calculate yearly percent changes using a
linear regression by neighborhood. We classify neighborhoods as having
experienced a decrease if the average yearly reduction in homicide risk
was below 1%. We classify them as having experienced an increase if
the neighborhood homicide risk above 1% . All others are classified as
having no change.

Figures

Figure 1. Housing Transactions around Parks:
Neighborhood Distance Intervals

Notes: The following figure shows transactions within 3/8 miles of the nearest park in Chicago. The zoom in figure
represents the ‘neighborhood’ around Marquette Park. It contains all of the transactions (4,623) within three-eights of a
mile that are not closer to another a park. Colors correspond to different distance intervals or ‘bands’ around the park.

Figure 2. Homicide Risk Heat Map for Chicago
(3-Year Moving Average)

Notes: Shades represent levels of homicide risk, which we measure as the expected number of homicides per square mile.
Estimates are based geolocated crime data for years 2001-2003 and 2013-2015. We use a bivariate Gaussian kernel with a
bandwidth of 1/4 of a mile on a 1/8 mile city grid to estimate the likelihood per square mile of a homicide in each grid.
We then calculate the expected number of homicides using the total number of city homicides.

Notes: Homicide rate is defined as the number of homicides per square mile for Chicago (2001-2016), New York (2006-2016),
and Philadelphia (2006-2016)

Figure 4. Homicide Risk by Neighborhood:
Relative Risk Near Parks vs Overall Risk

Notes: The vertical axis denotes the ratio between the average homicide risk per square mile within 1/8 mile of a park
and the rest of the neighborhood (2-3/8 of a mile). The horizontal axis measures the average yearly homicide risk in the
neighborhood (within 3/8 of a mile). Ratios are computed using averages across the study period.

Figure 5. Transaction Prices by Homicide Risk:
Near Parks Versus Comparison Properties

Notes: Figure plots estimates
P of transaction prices at different homicide rates using:
Vijt = Pi β P + Hijt β H + k Pik Hijt βkP H + Di β D + γj + ζtc + uijt , where Vijt , is the sales price of house i in
neighborhood j, city c, year t. Pik are indicators for distance to park, where the excluded category is 2 to 5/16 of a mile.
Hijt are indicators for different levels of homicide risk around property i. Di are dwelling characteristics which are
described in panel B of Table 1. γj are neighborhood fixed effects, and ζtc are city-year interaction indicators. Round
markers plot estimates for the comparison group of properties from parks between 2 to 5/16 miles, the excluded category,
hence β H . The triangle markers plot estimates for near parks, β H + β1P + β1P H . Bars denote 90% confidence intervals.

Vijt = Pi β P + H̃ijt β H + k Pik H̃ijt βkP H + γj + ζtc + uijt , where Vijt , is the sales price of house i in neighborhood j, city
c, year t. Pik are indicators for distance to park at intervals of 1/16 of a mile (roughly one block) and H̃ijt is the square
root of homicide risk per square mile around property i. γj are neighborhood fixed effects, and ζtc are city-year interaction
indicators. Square markers for no homicide risk illustrate βkP , while diamond markers for high homicide risk illustrate
√
βkP + 9βkP H . Bars denote 90% confidence intervals.

Appendix: Identification in the NSD and NSD + IV Frameworks

As discussed in Section 5.5, the identification of estimates presented in Table 2 is threatened
if changes in the price effects of parks are correlated with unobservables. We formalize the
discussion in this section by examining the effect of different possible types of omitted variables
and examine the primary identification assumptions in each of our models. For simplicity, we
begin with a simplified version of equation (5):
Vijt = Pi β P + Hijt β H + Pi Hijt β P H + γj + ζtc + uijt

(B.1)

where Vijt is the sales price of house i in neighborhood j, city c, year t. Pi denotes properties
within 1/16 miles of a park and Hijt is our homicide risk measure. Pi Hijt measures homicide
risk near parks. γj is the neighborhood fixed effect and ζtc is a fixed effect for transaction city
and year, uijt is an error term.
B.1

Identifying β P H Using Neighborhood Differences

We consider an augmented version of the model above following Wooldridge (2010) notation
that includes omitted variables correlated only with park proximity and not with homicides
(qijt ), those that are correlated only with homicide risk and not with parks (νijt ), and those
that are correlated only with the interaction (φijt ). Projectecting the error term uijt that include
omitted variables into the observables

L(uijt |P, H, P H) = η P Pi + η H Hijt + η P H Pi Hijt
| {z } | {z } | {z }
qitj

νijt

(B.2)

φijt

where the η l for l = P, H, P H measure the relationship between the unboservables and the
observables that they affect. Plugging these into equation (B.1):

Vijt = Pi (β P + η P ) + Hijt (β H + η H ) + Pi Hijt (β P H + η P H ) + γj + ζtc + µ̃ijt

(B.3)

where the error term, µ̃ijt , has mean zero and is uncorrelated with each regressor.46 If the
exclusion restriction stated in equation (7) is valid, then η P H = 0 and β P H is identified.
Using a potential outcomes formulation, we can also see that if assumption (7) doesn’t hold,
then the interaction term (β P H ) contains an unobserved variable that is not differenced out:

Threats to Identification in the NSD Model

In the paper we, examine three types of omitted variables that could be included in φijt and
would violate the identifying assumption in our NSD model: (1) time-varying unobservables
between neighborhoods may differentially affect price near parks (υjt ), (2) unobserved property
characteristics may result in price differences near parks, even within neighborhoods (σi ), (3)
time-varying unobservables within neighborhoods may affect price near parks versus farther
away (χijt ).
φijt = υjt + σi + χijt
(2)

(1)

(B.7)

(3)

As discussed throughout Section 5, the assumption that these terms are zero may be too restrictive in our setting. We relax them and address possible violations in a variety of ways. We
address (1) υjt in Table 2 by adding neighborhood specific time trends and even more flexibly
in Table 4 with park-neighborhood by year fixed effects. We address (2) σi in Table 6 using
repeat-sales estimates in the NSD design. We address (3) χijt in Table 2 by adding time-varying
socio-economic controls that are interacted with our park indicator and with homicides. We
alternately relax (3) in Table 4 by introducing controls for separate neighborhood-specific trends
within 1/16th mile vs 2-16ths mile from a park.
B.3

Identifying β P H Using IV + NSD

We go on to more comprehensively address (3) (χijt ) with an instrumental variables strategy.
This IV assumes that city-level shocks to homicide rates will affect local homicide risk but are
not correlated with within-neighborhood differences in price changes near parks. The second
stage of the IV strategy then takes the form:
V

Vijt = β P Pi + β H Ĥijt + β P H Pi Hijt
V

+ Pi qijt + Ĥijt νijt + Pi Hijt · φijt + γj + ζtc + uijt

(B.8)

iv ) needs only to be
In order to identify the complementarity coefficient β P H , the instrument (Hijt
orthogonal to φijt . In other words, the exclusion restriction of this model requires that city-level
shocks to the homicide rate affect within-neighborhood changes in housing price through effects
on local homicide risk and not through other channels. If this is true, then Cov(Ĥijt , φijt ) =
0. Importantly, identification of the complementarity (β P H ) in B.8 does not require that the
instrument separately identifies the direct effect of crime on prices (β H ). To illustrate this point,
we assume that the effect of homicides on prices are not identified by the IV: Cov(Ĥijt , νijt ) 6= 0.
If this is the case, then νijt will be differenced out as illustrated in equations (B.5) and (B.6).

61

B.4

Validity of the Instrumental Variables Strategy

Although the exclusion restriction cannot be tested directly, we provide a number of indirect
tests. In particular, we test whether the instrument is correlated with changes in:
i other public goods near parks
ii homicide incidence near parks
iii bar and restaurant establishments
We then examine robustness of estimates to:
iv possible endogeneity of initial risk within neighborhood
v controls for zone-specific park expenditures
For (i) and (ii), we estimate the following equation:
IV
IV
Tbjt = τ P P̃i + τ H Hbjt
+ τ P H P̃i Hbjt
+ γj + ζtc + ubjt

(B.9)

where Tbjt measures the unemployment rate for block group b, in neighborhood j in year t.
HltIV is the instrument: the projected number of homicides in year t in block b, as described in
equation (9). γj are park-neighborhood fixed effects and ζjc are city-year effects.47

47

Our measures of demographic characteristics are annualized by interpolating the matched census blocks and
block groups from the 2000, 2010 census, and the 2011-15 ACS. Population and population-by-race are obtained
at the block level whereas median income and median age at the block group level, which is the finest geography
that they are available.

While limited, this test provides some evidence that the instrument does not predict changes in
local labor market activity that could reflect changes in public goods provision or other amenity
changes.
Next, we examine if the instruments predicts the relative incidence of homicides near parks
using a similar specification. This helps to separate possible quantity effects (amount of crime)
from price effects (value per crime), the focus of our hypothesis. To do so, we estimate the
following equation:

Hijt = P̃i ϑP + ϑH Ht−jc + P̃i Ht−jc ϑP H + Di ϑD + Xijt ϑX + γj + ζtc + uijt

(B.10)

where Hijt is homicide is the property level homicide risk and Htc is the number of homicides
in city c, remaining controls are those described for equation (6). Table B.2 reports results
from two different specifications, the one described in equation B.10 and a more restrictive
specification where we include neighborhood by year fixed effects. These tests indicate that
shocks to homicides at the city level predict homicides at the property level, but there is no
evidence of differential effects on the incidence of homicides near parks relative to our comparison
zones. This evidence suggests that changes in the city level homicide rate affect the prices of
homes near parks through the differential value of crime reduction near parks rather than
through differential effects on homicide risk near parks.

level homicides that exclude the specific neighborhood homicides. Standard errors
clustered at the neighborhood level are in parentheses.
* Significant at 10% level; ** significant at 5% level; *** significant at 1% level.

Next, we examine relationship between homicide risk and bars and restaurants using data at the
5-digit zip level, normalized by area. The aggregation of publicly available data at the 5-digit
zip code reduces our ability to examine within-neighborhood differences. All estimates suggest
a smaller number of establishments near parks, which may reflect the smaller area within the
64

0 to 1/16th distance bin. We find no evidence of changes in the number of neighborhoodlevel restaurants near parks as a function of changes in homicide risk. In panel B, we report
estimates for the sample of zips that are smaller than at least one associated park, which provide
the strongest possible test by measuring changes at a more dis-aggregate level with variation
within neighborhoods. The evidence is consistent with that provided in panel A.

Notes: Explanatory variables are the same as described in Tables 2 and 8. The number
of restaurants comes from Census Zip Codes Business Patterns: https://www.census.gov/
data/developers/data-sets/cbp-nonemp-zbp/zbp-api.html. In the Restricted Sample panel
data are restricted to zip codes that are smaller
66 than at least 1 associated park and merged
with property-level data. We use the first two years of data to construct the instrument.
Standard errors clustered at the neighborhood level are in parentheses. * Significant at
10% level; ** significant at 5% level; *** significant at 1% level.

We then test the robustness of our results using a lagged version of our IV + NSD model. The
instrument is constructed using the same initial shares, but 1st stage estimates are generated
using a truncated dataset that drops the first 5 years of the sample. This lagged version of the
IV tests the robustness of our results to the possible endogeneity of initial shares of homicide
risk within neighborhoods. We note that endogeneity in the distribution of initial homicide risk
between neighborhoods is addressed using flexible neighborhood-level fixed effects in the IV +
NSD model. The results reported in Table B.4 indicate that our estimates are robust to the
lagged version of the IV.

* Significant at 10% level; ** significant at 5% level; *** significant at 1% level.

Finally, we test the robustness of our estimates to changes in park-specific expenditures
across three zones in Chicago. If improvements in park equipment, facilities, programming or
management occur simultaneously with crime reductions, then they could confound estimates
of the complementarity. City budget appropriations data are available for the northern, central,
and southern zones of Chicago for the years 2011-2017. As a result, this test involves a small
subset of the total transactions in the study (N=21,752). While less precise, base estimates
of the park premium and the complementarity reported in columns 1 and 3 are consistent
with the main findings of the paper. Column 2 adds controls for concurrent zone-specific park
expenditures. A comparison of column 1 to column 2 indicates that estimates are not sensitive
to this control. Column 3 adds (1 year) lagged expenditures. A comparison of column 3 to
column 4 indicates that estimates are similarly robust to controls for lagged expenditures.
