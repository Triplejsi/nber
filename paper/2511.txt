Stock Prices, Earnings and Expected Dividends
ABSTRACT
This paper presents estimates indicating that, for aggregate U.S.
stock market data 1871-1986, a long historical average of real earnings
is a good predictor of the present value of future real dividends.

This

is true even when the information contained in stock prices is taken into
account.

We estimate that for each year the optimal forecast of the

present value of future real dividends is roughly a weighted average of
moving average earnings and current real price, with between 2/3 and 3/4

of the weight on the earnings measure.

This means that simple present

value models of stock prices can be strongly rejected.

We use a vector autoregressive approach which enables us to compute
the implicationa of this for the behavior of stock prices and returns.
We estimate that log dividend-price ratios are more variable than, and
virtually uncorrelated with, their theoretical counterparts given the
present value models.

Annual returns on stocks are quite highly

correlated with their theoretical counterparts, but are two to four times
as variable.
Our approach also reveals the connection between recent papers showing
forecastability of long-horizon returns on corporate stocks, and earlier
literature claiming that stock prices are too volatile to be accounted
for in terms of simple present value models.

We show that excess

volatility directly implies the forecastability of long-horizon returns.

Introduct.j
In this paper we present estimates indicating that data on accounting

earnings, when averaged over many years, help to predict the present
value of future dividends.

This result holds even when stock prices

themselves are taken into account.

The data are the real Standard and

Poor Composite Index and associated dividend and earnings series 1871Our estimates indicate to what extent dividend-price ratios and

1987.

returns on this index behave in accordance with simple present value
models, and allow us to shed new light on earlier claims that stock
prices are too volatile to accord with such models (LeRoy and Porter
1981,

Shiller 1981, Mankiw, Romer, and Shapiro 1985, Campbell and Shiller

l987a, 1987b, and West 1988).
It seems appropriate to consider earnings data for forecasting
dividends, since earnings are constructed by accountants with the
objective of helping people to evaluate the fundamental worth of a
company.

However the precise economic meaning of earnings data is not

clearly defined; accounting definitions are complicated and change
through time in ways that are not readily documented.

Because of this,

many studies of financial time series have avoided the use of earnings
data and have thus omitted relevant information about fundamental value
-

from the analysis1.

1

There is a large accounting literature on the response of
securities prices to earnings announcements; see Kormendi and Lipe (1987)
for a list of references. However with a few exceptions, notably
Kormendi and Lipe, this literature does not ask whether the response is
consistent with a particular fundamental valuation model for the security
price.
1

Our approach is to introduce earnings, measured either annually or as
an average over a number of years, as an information variable in a vector
autoregressive (VAR) framework. Any errors in measurement in earnings
are accounted for automatically by the estimation procedure, which allows
earnings to enter the model only insofar as they are useful in
forecasting.

The VAR framework, developed originally in Campbell and

Shiller (1987a,

1987b),

enables us to answer two questions.

First, what

component of stock returns can be Dredicted given the information used in
the VAR system?

Secondly, what component of stock returns can be

accounted for ex post by news about future dividends?

The existing

literature addresses the first question, but the second question is also
important for evaluating present value models.

As Shiller (1984) and

Summers (1984) have shown, it is possible to construct a model in which
only a small fraction of I-period stock returns is predictable, but in
which news about fundamental value accounts for only a small part of the
variability of ex post returns.
Our approach reveals that stock returns and dividend-price ratios are
too volatile to be accounted for by news about future dividends.
Further, this excess volatility is closely related to the predictability
of multi-period returns.

It has recently been shown that stock returns

are more highly predictable when they are measured over intervals of
Fama

several years, rather than over short intervals of a year or less.

and French (l987a, 1987b) have made this point most forcefully, although
the result can also be found in Flood, Hodrick and Kaplan (1986), and

returns can be explained by variables such as lagged multi-year stock
returns or dividend-price ratios.

The explained variances are higher

when dividend-price ratios are used than when lagged returns are used.
It may be helpful, by way of motivation, to give at the outset a
simple story indicating why excess volatility is fundamentally related to
this forecastability of multi-period returns.

Let us consider the

simplest argument for excess volatility given in the original LeRoy and
Porter (1981) and Shiller (1981) papers.

It was argued in those papers

that if, as the present value model asserts, price

A

forecast error must be uncorrelated with the corresponding forecast, so
must be uncorrelated with

Therefore var(P*) —

var(P) +

var(u).

Since variances cannot be negative, the variance inequality follows.
This argument can be reversed to show that if the variance inequality is
violated in U.S. data, then it must be that P

a sort of infinite-

of infinite-period returns.
While the above simple story is illustrative of the nature of our
argument, we will restate it below in

estimated with a terminal condition, we will

take account of earnings data, and we will allow for a simple form of

time-variation in the real discount rate on stock.

These advances are

made possible by our use of the VAR framework discussed above.

In our

earlier work using this framework (Campbell and Shiller l987b), we found
that our rejection of the hypothesis that one-period returns are
unforecastable was much less strong than our rejection of the hypothesis
that the dividend-price ratio equals the theoretical dividend-price ratio
given the present value model. We will see that this is essentially the
same result as noted by Fama and French and others that the one-period
return is much less forecastable than the multiperiod return. The limit
of their excess return regression, where returns are computed over an
infinite period of time, is essentially our test that the stock price
equals the expected present value of future dividends.

Thus we argue

that excess volatility and predictability of multi-period returns are not
two phenomena, but one.
The organization of the paper is as follows.

In section 2 we discuss

our data and show that dividend-price and earnings-price ratios predict
stock returns measured over several years.

We also present an approxi-

mation to the continuously compounded stock return, which we need to use
in our VAR analysis.

We show that predictability of approximate returns

is close to that of exact returns.

In section 3 we explain our VAR

methodology and relate it to research on multi-period returns.

In

section 4 we present basic VAR results, and in section 5 we use them to
compare the historical behavior of stock prices and returns with the
behavior implied by the present value model.

Section 6 checks the

robustness of our results to changes in specification.

Predicting Stock Returns Using Prices. Dividends and Earnings
The data set used in this paper consists of annual observations on

prices, dividends and earnings for the Standard and Poors Composite Stock
Price Index, extended back to 1871 by using the data in Cowles (1939).
The series on prices and dividends are also used in Campbell and Shiller
(]L987a,

l987b), and in much of the literature on volatility tests.

Campbell and Shiller (1987b) show that the properties of the post-1926
data are very similar to those of the CRSP series on the value-weighted
New York Stock Exchange Index, while Wilson and Jones (1987) have
carefully analyzed the pre-1926 data.

We deflate nominal series using a

January Producer Price Index (annual average before 1900).

excess returns has the advantage that price deflators cancel so that
results are not contaminated by measurement error in the deflators.
We begin our empirical work by regressing real and excess stock
returns on some explanatory variables which are known in advance (at the
start of year t).

For real returns, we consider the following

variables2: the log dividend-price ratio,

((e1.i..

earnings minus current log real price,

The ratio variables are used here with the same motivation that we see
in the financial press, as indicators of fundamental value relative to
price.

The notion is that if stocks are underpriced relative to

fundamental value returns tend to be high subsequently, conversely if
stocks are overpriced.

A moving average of earnings is used because

yearly earnings are quite noisy as measures of fundamental value; they
could evem be negative while fundamental value cannot be negative.

The

use of an average of earnings in computing the earnings-price ratio has a
long history.

Graham and Dodd (1934) recommended an approach that

the current earnings to the average earnings, which should cover a period

of not less than five years, and preferably seven to ten years."
(Security Analysis, page 452).

We push their averaging scheme even

further, to 30 years, in recognition of the substantial decadal
variability of earnings, under the supposition that fundamental value may
be less variable than this decadal variability.
We regress real stock returns on each of these variables individually,
and also on the combination

Vector Autorearessive Anroach

In the previous section we derived en approximation to the log return
on stock which is linear in log dividend-price ratios and dividend growth
rates.

We now exploit this linearity in analyzing stock price movements.

First, we write the discounted i-period log return as an explicit

From equations (3)

and (4) we have:

Equation (5) shows that the discounted i-period return is higher, the
higher is the dividend-price ratio when the investment is initiated, the
lower is the dividend-price ratio when the investment is terminated, and
the higher is dividend growth between those two dates7.
We can also use this equation to see the relationship between multiperiod returns and the literature on price volatility.

Note that as i grows larger, less weight is given in (5) to the
terminal dividend-price ratio
and hence to the terminal price. One
might wonder why the terminal price is downweighted in an approximate
expression for log total return over t to t+i. The reason is that as i is
increased the component of total return due to reinvestment of
intervening dividends at the fixed rate grows larger, causing the slope
of the log function at the point of linearization to approach zero as i
is increased.

This relation is what Campbell and Shiller (1987b) call the "dividendratio model".

It may also be described as a dynamic Cordon model, after

the simple growth model proposed by Myron Cordon (1962), which makes the
dividend-price ratio equal the interest rate minus the growth rate of
dividends. The original Cordon model did not specify how the dividendprice ratio should change through time if interest rates or growth rates
change through time:

equation (7)' says that the dividend-price ratio is

related to a present value of expected one-period interest rates and
dividend growth rates.
The linearity of these relationships makes it possible to test them as
restrictions on a vector autoregression. This procedure has several

These are complicated nonlinear restrictions on the coefficient matrix A,
but they do simplify in two special cases, which are emphasized in
Campbell and Shiller (1987b).

First, if i—l then we have a set of linear

one can postmultiply by (I-p1A1) for any i to

get the i-period restriction.

The reverse is also possible since

stationarity of the VAR guarantees nonsingularity of (I-p'A').

This

algebraic equivalence reflects the fact that if 1-period returns are
completely unpredictable, then i-period returns must also be; and vice
versa.

Nevertheless, Wald tests on the VAR may yield different results

18

depending on which value of i is chosen, just as regression tests did in
Tables 1 and 2.
The VAR approach can easily be modified to handle different
specifications.

To test the model in which expected excess returns are

constant, one simply replaces

with

and proceeds as before.

To

handle higher-order VAR behavior, one estimates the higher-order system
and then stacks it into first-order "companion" form as discussed by
Sargent (1979) and Campbell and Shiller (1987a, 1987b).

When

4. Results of the VAR Procedure
In Table 3 we apply the VAR method to our data on stock prices,
dividends and earnings over the period 1871-1987.

The sample period is

truncated at the beginning to allow for construction of a 30-year moving
average of earnings, but it need not be truncated at the end even though
we will test for unpredictability of multi-period returns.

We estimate

first-order VAR's, using real dividend growth in panel A (to test the

The coefficients in the second row (the dividend growth

These results

suggest that some improvement is possible in the dividend growth equation
proposed by Marsh and Merton (1986, 1987), which does not use the long

In this section we use the VAR estimates in Table 3 to compare actual
stock prices and returns with their theoretical counterparts. We find
that with the constant expected real return model, the log dividend-price
ratio

has only a weak relation to its theoretical counterpart

Except for the fact that the significance levels in the

1-period return regression decline with lag length, the conclusions for
the most part do not seem to be very sensitive to the order of the
estimated VAR.
We also checked to see whether a shorter 10-year moving average of
earnings gives similar results to those reported in Tables 3 and 4.

As

one would expect from the regression results in Tables 1 and 2, the 10year moving average gets less weight in the estimated equation (constant

higher, although other results are similar to those in Tables 3 and 4.
We note that this correlation is sensitive to VAR lag length; it falls
towards the values in Tables 3 and 4 when the lag length is increased.
Thus it seems that the use of a 3-decade moving average of earnings is
not essential to our results.
Finally, we estimated the VAR system in Table 3 for the shorter sample
1927-86.

We obtained results which were very similar to those for the

full sample period.

26

7. Conclusion

Our results indicate that a long moving average of real earnings helps
to forecast future real dividends. The ratio of this earnings variable
to the current stock price is a powerful predictor of the return on
stock, particularly when the return is measured over several years.

We

have shown that these facts make stock prices and returns much too
volatile to accord with a simple present value model.

Yet annual returns

do seem to carry some information and are correlated with what they
should be given the model.
Whenever a new variable is introduced into an analysis, in this case
the long moving average of earnings, and the new variable plays an
important role in the results, it is natural for critics to wonder if the

new variable really belongs in the analysis. There is always the
possibility that many different variables were attempted, until the
results changed, and only the one that changed the results was reported.
However, we think that it can be argued that a long moving average of
earnings is a very natural variable to use to represent fundamental
value, and that there are not many competitors for this role.

We note

also that we found evidence of excess volatility in earlier research
(Campbell and Shiller 1987b) which did not use the information in
earnings.
In evaluating our results, it should also be borne in mind that
(disregarding small sample considerations) if we find one variable that
destroys the model, then introducing new variables can never save the
model.

Since the log dividend-price ratio

S

is in the information set

assumed, it should get a unit coefficient and all other variables should

27

get zero coefficients in the equation for the theoretical log dividend
price ratio

8.

Adding more variables can never bring us back to this

situation, so long as the earnings variable is included. Another way to
put this,

recalling our argument that excess volatility is the same as

forecastability of multi-period returns, is that once a forecasting
variable is found that predicts multiperiod returns, adding new
forecasting variables can never make them unforecastable.

28

Appendix: Data Sources
The stock price and dividend data, the producer-price index data and
the interest rate data are the same as in Campbell and Shiller (1987b).
The nominal stock price index is the Standard and Poor Composite Index
for January of each year. The Dividend series is the total dividends per
share for the year adjusted to index. The producer price index is the BL
series (formerly wholesale price index) for January starting in 1900,
annual average before 1900.

The nominal interest rate series is the tota

return to investing for six months in January at the January 4-6 month
prime commercial paper rate (six month starting January 1980) and for
another six months at the July 4-6 month prime commercial paper rate

(Si:

month starting July 1980). The nominal earnings series for 1926 to 1986
is from Standard and Poor Statistical Service: earnings per share
adjusted to index, composite, four quarter total, fourth quarter. The
Standard and Poor earnings series begins in 1926, however, Alfred Cowles
who is also responsible for the published Standard and Poor Composite
Index 1871-1925, extended the earnings series back to 1871 (1939). The
problem he faced was absence of earnings data for many of the stocks in
the Standard and Poor Composite Index. He thus computed an annual series

P-l

-

"prices

of stocks for which Earnings Data are available, all

stocks," a series of earnings E-l on these stocks, and the ratio R-1 of
these series, the "earnings-price ratio." Our nominal earnings is series
R-1 (Cowles (1939) pages 404-5) times the annual average Standard and
Poor Composite Index for the year. (The

S&P Composite Index 1871-1925 i

the same as Cowles "common stock index" series P-l, for all stocks,
Cowles (1939), pages 66-7, times a constant.)
29

The absence of earnings data for some stocks is of some importance for
the accuracy of the earnings series. One indication of the potential
importance of their omission can be found by comparing the series P-l
(The Cowles index for all stocks) and the series

P-l

(the Cowles series

to

1871-1925 ranged from 0.98 to 1.27,

the biggest discrepancies

of the
occuring in the earliest years of the sample. Another suggestion
importance of the omissions is in Cowles list ((1939), Appendix II,
pp.456-75) of the companies in the index and the years for which the
companies' earnings are available. Typically, lack of data on earnings
comes for isolated years (as if earnings reports were occasionally
of
missing) or for single years near the begin or end of the inclusion
the company in the index.
Wilson and Jones (1987) have recently examined the Cowles data for
accuracy. They found some apparent errors in Cowles' monthly series of
cumulated returns (Cowles data implied negative dividends for some
months) and produced an alternative monthly return series that attempted
to correct these errors. They concluded that "the overall impact of these
revisions as compared to the original Cowles Commission data is
minimal."8 We do not use the Cowles monthly data that they criticise,
computing returns on

a

January to January basis assuming dividends are

not reinvested during the year.

NOTES TO TABLES
Table 1
The numbers reported are the R2 in the regression of return on the
explanatory variables, and in parentheses the significance level of a Wald
test of the hypothesis that all coefficients in the regression are zero.
The Wald test adjusts for overlapping data in regressions with multi-period
returns, but does not adjust for heteroskedasticity. The sample period is
1871-1987, truncated at the end where necessary to compute multi-period
returns.
