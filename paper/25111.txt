Exchange Rates, Local Currency Pricing and International Tax Policies
Sihao Chen, Michael B. Devereux, Jenny Xu, and Kang Shi
NBER Working Paper No. 25111
September 2018
JEL No. F3,F4
ABSTRACT
Empirical evidence suggests that for many countries, retail prices of traded goods are sticky in
national currencies. Movements in exchange rates then cause deviations from the law of one
price, and exchange rate ëmisalignmentí, which cannot be corrected by monetary policy alone.
This paper shows that a state contingent international tax policy can be combined with monetary
policy to eliminate exchange rate misalignment and sustain a fully efficient welfare outcome. But
this monetary-fiscal mix cannot be decentralized with non-cooperative determination of monetary
and fiscal policy. Non-cooperative use of taxes and subsidies introduces strategic spillovers
which opens up a fundamental conflict between the goals of output gap and inflation stabilization
and those of terms of trade manipulation in an open economy. The implementation of an efficient
monetary-fiscal mix requires effective cooperation in fiscal policy, while leaving monetary policy
to be determined non-cooperatively. In addition, while an efficient outcome requires state
contingent taxes and subsidies to eliminate exchange rate misalignment, it is still necessary to
have flexible exchange rates and independent monetary policy.

Introduction

The bene…t of ‡exible exchange rates represents a central pillar of open economy macroeconomics. Famously, Friedman (1953) argued for the ease of adjusting relative prices
with nominal exchange rate movement as opposed to nominal prices in an environment
of sticky prices. The extension of the Friedman case for ‡exible exchanges rate is that
it allows for national monetary independence. With ‡exible exchange rates, individual
countries can follow independent, or ‘self-oriented’monetary policies (using the language
of Obstfeld and Rogo¤, 2002), without the need for international policy cooperation.
The more recent New Keynesian open economy literature has articulated Friedman’s
argument in fully speci…ed welfare-based DSGE models. In particular Clarida, Gali and
Gertler (2002) and Obstfeld and Rogo¤ (2002) show that an optimal monetary policy requires ‡exible exchange rates, and in certain environments, self-oriented monetary policymaking can achieve a global optimum, without the need for (or any bene…ts of) international policy cooperation.

1

Both these papers however follow the traditional assumption

about traded goods pricing, notably that prices are set in producer’s currency (PCP).
Recent contributions have quali…ed these arguments, based on the evidence that nominal exchange rate adjustment may fail to achieve e¢ cient relative price adjustment. For
instance, when traded goods prices are set in the currency of the buyer (local currency
pricing, or LCP), movements in nominal exchange rates will generate deviations from the
law of one price across countries. In this case, independent monetary policy and ‡exible
exchange rates cannot fully undo the ine¢ ciencies generated by nominal price stickiness.
Engel (2011) constructs a New Keynesian open economy model with LCP, and shows that
optimal monetary policy faces a trade-o¤ between the output gap, in‡ation control, and
exchange rate ‘misalignment’ due to deviations from the law of one price. In this case,
even cooperative monetary policy-making cannot achieve a full global optimum.
Fujiwara and Wang (2017) extend Engel’s model to the case of non-cooperative policy
making. They identify a new set of strategic ine¢ ciencies associated with non-cooperative

Many other papers have analyzed non-cooperative monetary policy in open economies. See for instance

Corsetti and Pesenti, 2001, and Corsetti, Dedola and Leduc, 2010. We discuss the literature more fully

policy-making in an environment of LCP, and show that in general there are positive gains
to policy-cooperation under LCP, even in the case where no such gains would exist with
PCP.
A separate and more recent literature has widened the debate on the limits to monetary
policy by exploring the possibility of using targeted …scal instruments to achieve e¤ective
relative price adjustment even when nominal prices cannot move. One strand of this
literature is motivated by the constraints of a single currency area, where by de…nition
nominal exchange rates cannot respond to country speci…c shocks. For instance, Fahri
Gopinath and Itskhoki (2013) show that a set of taxes and subsidies can replicate an
exchange rate devaluation under a …xed exchange rate regime. Other papers are motivated
by the constraints on monetary policy imposed by the zero lower bound (see for instance,
Correa, Fahri, Nicolini, and Teles 2013). But as we have discussed, local currency pricing
also imposes limits on the ability of monetary policy to achieve fully e¢ cient outcomes.
Somewhat less attention has been paid to this case.

2

Can these constraints be undone

by targeted sets of taxes and subsidies? This is the …rst question addressed in the current
paper.
Our paper asks whether policy makers can use a set of consumption and producer
taxes and subsidies to eliminate the distortions imposed by deviations from the law of
one price. Do these …scal instrument then restore the e¢ cacy of monetary policy and the
bene…ts of ‡exible exchange rates, or indeed possibly eliminate the need for exchange rate
adjustment at all?
But the second more important question we address is whether the use of …scal instruments restores the case for self-oriented policymaking (monetary independence). As noted
above, Fujiwara and Wang (2017) show that there are losses from non-cooperative policy
making under LCP. If policy makers have access to taxes and subsidies that can eliminate
deviations from the law of one price (or exchange rate misalignment), does this imply that
independent non-cooperative policy making can sustain full e¢ ciency? Alternatively, one
might conjecture that the addition of independent …scal policy instruments into policy2

A notable exception is Adao Correa and Teles 2009, who derive a set of tax policies that can achieve

an e¢ cient global outcome independent of the type of nominal price stickiness. We discuss their paper
and the di¤erences from ours in more detail below.

making introduces a new set of strategic ine¢ ciencies in independent policymaking.
Our paper investigates these two questions. We construct a two country open economy model under LCP along the lines of Engel (2011) and Fujiwara and Wang (2017).
Each country is subjected to random shocks to labour productivity. Generically, this environment is characterized by exchange rate misalignment, causing welfare losses due to
deviations from the law of one price. We then identify a set of taxes and subsidies that
can eliminate ine¢ ciencies coming from these deviations from the law of one price. In
particular, in response to a home country (positive) productivity shock, an optimal tax
policy entails a positive home country tax on imports and a foreign country subsidy to
exports, combined with the opposite response of the foreign consumption tax and the
home exporter production subsidy. This set of tax-subsidy responses can perfectly replicate the relative price movement that would take place under PCP, eliminating deviations
from the law of one price. Intuitively, this tax-subsidy combination will lead consumers
and producers to tilt their behaviour in a manner that would occur if all prices were set
in producer’s currency and there existed full exchange rate pass-through in traded goods
prices.
An interesting feature of this optimal policy mix is that it does not obviate the need
for exchange rate adjustment. We show that, conditional on the optimal set of taxes
and subsidies being in place, an optimal monetary rule will call for exchange rates to
adjust to productivity shocks exactly as would occur under PCP, as in Clarida, Gali, and
Gertler (2002), for instance. Thus, the use of optimal taxes and subsides fully restores
Friedman’s ‘case for ‡exible exchange rates’. Translated into our model, using the welfare
approximations of Engel (2011) and Fujiwara and Wang (2017), we show that a cooperative equilibrium in which the policy maker chooses both …scal and monetary policy
simultaneously will achieve the fully e¢ cient ‡exible price equilibrium.
We then address the critical question of implementability. Is this equilibrium consistent
with non-cooperative policy-making? Here, our results are quite striking. We …nd that
the ability to independently choose consumption taxes and production subsidies opens up
a new strategic channel in non-cooperative policy making associated with terms of trade
manipulation. Acting independently, each policymaker attempts to bias the tax-subsidy

3

instruments so as to raise its expected terms of trade. Strikingly, we show that, when the
tax-subsidy choice is unrestricted, there is in fact no equilibrium to the non-cooperative
game consistent with …nite in‡ation rates and output gaps.

3

We address this dilemma in two ways. First, we show that if we impose a particular
restriction on the set of consumption taxes and production subsidies, then the equilibrium of the non-cooperative game will coincide with the cooperative equilibrium, and will
attain the ‡exible price equilibrium. In particular this condition requires that the home
consumption tax be restricted to equal the foreign production subsidy.
But this restriction may seem somewhat arbitrary, and it is unclear how it would be
imposed in a non-cooperative equilibrium. To resolve this, we conclude that an e¢ cient
monetary-…scal mix will require …scal policy cooperation. We de…ne a new game in which
taxes and subsidies are chosen by a cooperative …scal authority maximizing world welfare,
while monetary policy is determined independently by each monetary authority. We show
that the equilibrium of this game will be the same as the cooperative equilibrium in which
both …scal and monetary policy are chosen by a single benevolent authority.
The implication of these results is then clear - an optimally chosen set of …scal responses
can eliminate the restrictions on monetary policy implied by LCP, and restore the bene…ts
of ‡exible exchange rates. But in order for this to be consistent with independent ‘selfreliance’in monetary policy, it is necessary to have e¤ective cooperation in …scal policy.
Alternatively, the message could be interpreted as saying that absent …scal cooperation, or
e¤ective restrictions on …scal responses, the use of taxes and subsidies to correct deviations
from the law of one price and support independent policy-making cannot be successful.
An interesting feature of our results is that the use of optimal tax-subsidies changes
the nature of optimal monetary policy under LCP. Engel (2011) argues that under LCP,
even if output gaps in both countries were somehow eliminated and producer price in‡a3

We note that the channel of terms of trade manipulation in optimal monetary policy has been explored

extensively in the New Keynesian literature. See for instance Corsetti and Pesenti, 2001, and Clarida Gali
and Gertler 2002 for early discussion. But our results are quite di¤erent from the conventional analysis.
We show that this strategic ine¢ ciency is generated solely by the use of state varying …scal instruments in
monetary policy. Without the use of …scal instruments, the equilibrium under non-cooperative monetary
policy is well de…ned, as in Fujiwara and Wang 2017.

tion were zero, consumption is misallocated if there are currency misalignments, due to a
failure of e¢ cient cross-country risk-sharing. As a consequence, he shows that with LCP,
the monetary authority should target consumer price in‡ation instead of producer-price
in‡ation. We …nd that in both cooperative and non-cooperative games, so long as …scal
instruments are set optimally, the currency misalignment is eliminated, there are no deviations from the law of one prices, and there is full cross country risk-sharing (conditional
on home-bias in preferences). A consequence of this is that the monetary authority should
still target producer-price in‡ation in the dynamic model with staggered pricing.
A later section of the paper presents a quantitative analysis of welfare gains. The
welfare gains from correcting currency misalignments under a cooperative monetary policy
are very small. But the welfare gains from an optimal monetary …scal-mix, compared to
a non-cooperative monetary policy equilibrium under LCP, while still small in absolute
terms, are substantially larger.4
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the related literature. Section
3 presents the benchmark dynamic model with staggered price setting and explains why
the introduction of a fax on the consumption of foreign goods may correct the currency
misalignment. Section 4 introduces the staggered price model with state-contingent taxes
and export subsidies. In section 5, we show that, with the optimal choice of these taxes and
subsidies in a cooperative game, the ‡exible price equilibrium can be achieved. In Section
6 we explore policy-making without cooperation. We show that without restrictions on
…scal instruments, the non-cooperative equilibrium will not exist. We then introduce a
three player game, where a …scal authority chooses taxes and subsidies cooperatively, while
monetary authorities follow non-cooperative policies. Section 7 presents some quantitative
welfare analysis results. Section 8 discusses some other possible …scal instruments. Section
9 concludes.

This is in accord with the results of Fujiwara and Wang (2017), who quantify the welfare gains from

monetary policy cooperation under LCP.

Related Literature

Our paper is related to the literature on optimal …scal policy in open economies. Gali
and Monacelli (2008) study how the government chooses the optimal level of public consumption in a monetary union with lump-sum taxes. They …nd that the choice of …scal
policy raises union welfare. Hevia and Nicolini (2013) consider a small open economy with
‡exible exchange rates and state-contingent assets. They …nd that ‡exible price equilibrium is implementable, but exchange rates must move across states. Benigno and Paoli
(2010) also analyze optimal …scal policy and in small open economy, but in their set-up,
the optimal ‡exible price allocation cannot be achieved.
Our paper is quite closely related and complementary to Adao, Correia, and Teles
(2009). They show that in an environment with nominal rigidities, whatever is the type
of price setting (PCP or LCP), the exchange rate regime, whether ‡exible or …xed exchange rates, is irrelevant once …scal policy instruments (both taxes on labor income and
consumption of home and foreign goods) are taken into account. Hence …scal policy instruments can replicate the ‡exible price equilibrium even under LCP. They derive these
results using a Ramsey approach, which requires a benevolent social planner who can use
the available policy instruments to replicate the ‡exible price allocation. They do not
address the question of how to implement the optimal …scal policy in a non-cooperative
game, which is the main focus of our paper. We show that a Nash game of international
tax policy, together with inward-looking monetary policy, can replicate the ‡exible price
equilibrium, as long as we have …scal policy cooperation.
Another important di¤erence between our paper and theirs is related to the role of
exchange rate ‡exibility. They …nd that the ‡exible price allocation can be achieved by
…scal and monetary policies that induce stable producer prices and without movements in
the exchange rate. The exchange rate will not play any role, so the exchange rate regime
becomes irrelevant. But in our paper, it is critical to allow for ‡exible exchange rates,
in order to achieve complete risk sharing. Hence, the tax policies identi…ed in our paper
not only replicate the real variables under a ‡exible price allocation, but also replicate the
e¢ cient risk-sharing response of the exchange rate ‡uctuations under ‡exible prices.

Our paper also belongs to a small but fast growing literature that emphasizes the
role of …scal policy in replacing monetary policy or exchange rate policy as a macro
stabilization tool. Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2011) show that, when there is downward
wage rigidity and inelastic labor supply, a payroll subsidy alone can replicate the e¤ect of
nominal exchange rate devaluation. Farhi, Gopinath and Itskhoki (2013) show that, when
the exchange rate cannot be devalued, a small set of conventional …scal instruments can
robustly replicate the real allocation attained under a nominal exchange rate devaluation
in a dynamic New Keynesian open economy environment. In both these papers, the
assumption is that nominal exchange rate is …xed, perhaps due to membership of a single
currency area. In contrast, the exchange rate regime is ‡exible in our model, but exchange
rate changes are ine¢ cient due to LCP.
As mentioned in the introduction, the addition of …scal instruments to substitute or
complement monetary policy may also introduce strategic spillover channels when we
extend the analysis to study non-cooperative policy-making. A key result of our paper is
that absent some additional constraints on the design of corrective taxes or subsidies, in
an environment where policy-makers act independently, these strategic ine¢ ciencies may
render …scal policy ine¤ective in correcting macro ine¢ ciencies.
Finally, topic wise, this paper is also closely related to the literature on optimal monetary policy in open economy under LCP. This question is treated in Devereux and Engel
(2003). As discussed above, Engel (2011) shows that even with policy coordination, optimal monetary policy cannot replicate the ‡exible price equilibrium, due to the currency
misalignment induced by LCP. Fujiwara and Wang (2017) focus on a non-cooperative
game under LCP in a two-country dynamic general equilibrium model. They …nd that
in this case, policy makers face extra trade-o¤s regarding stabilizing real marginal cost
induced by the deviations from law of one price. Both papers therefore emphasize the imtwo state-contingent domestic bonds, but in their model there are no state-contingent international bonds.
So there is not risk-sharing across countries in their baseline model. When state-contingent bonds can be
traded across countries, they show that an extra …scal instrument, a state-contingent government bond, is
needed to produce the irrelevance result. Our framework by contrast is based on the assumption of complete
markets for cross-country risk-sharing. Section 8 below allows for a labor income tax and consumption
tax in our model, and shows that these instruments cannot replicate the ‡exible price equilibrium in a
non-cooperative Nash game.

Baseline Model and the Consumption Tax

In this section, we derive the loss function under the cooperative game in the standard
LCP model as in Engel (2011) and Fujiwara and Wang (2017). From the loss function,
we will explore the possible …scal instruments that can be used to correct the welfare loss
due to deviations from law of one price under local currency pricing.
Our baseline model is similar to Engel (2011) and Fujiwara and Wang (2017). There
are two countries of equal size, Home and Foreign, each populated with a continuum of
households with population size normalized to unity. Households in each country consume
both home and foreign goods with a symmetric home bias. They supply labor to …rms in
a competitive labor market. Firms are monopolisticly competitive and produce di¤erentiated goods. They set prices in a staggered manner (Calvo 1983) and in local currency.
In the model, the government levy a lump-sum tax on households and subsidize …rms
to eliminate steady-state distortions from monopolistic pricing. To avoid complexity, we
assume a complete …nancial market.

Linear-quadratic Loss Function and Consumption Tax

We …rst de…ne the loss function under the cooperative case and check if it is possible to use

The deviation from LOOP a¤ects the consumption demand for home produced goods
sold in foreign and foreign produced goods sold in home country. Intuitively, in face of a
positive technology shock in the home country, the local currency pricing strategy results
in a di¤erent response of price adjustment in di¤erent markets. This term associated with
dbt in the loss function measures the e¢ ciency loss of the home country due to LCP, since
the foreign country cannot allocate their consumption expenditure as e¢ ciently as under
the PCP case (where LOOP holds).

A simple way to correct the currency misalignment is to introduce a consumption tax
on imported goods which can respond to foreign technology shocks so that after-tax, the
deviation from the law of one price is zero. In other words, we can introduce a tax tc;t on
home imported goods and a tax tc;t on foreign imported goods such that the consumption
demand for imported goods will respond e¢ ciently, as under the PCP case. Speci…cally,
8

In Engel, currency misalignment is de…ned as mt = 21 (dbt + dbt ):

13

the price of home imported goods faced by consumers will be Pf h;t (1 + tc;t ), while the
price of foreign imported goods faced by consumers is Phf;t (1 + tc;t ). Then, hopefully in
log terms,

In the following section, we show that this consumption tax on imported goods can
correct the deviations from LOOP.

The Model with Fiscal Instruments

In this section, we introduce a consumption tax into the benchmark model and explore
the implications for welfare. We …nd that the introduction of a consumption tax will lead
to production distortions, so we also need to introduce a production subsidy to correct
this ine¢ ciency.

4.1

The System with Consumption Taxes

As discussed in Section 3, if we introduce a tax tc;t on home imported goods and a tax tc;t
on foreign imported goods, the demand functions for imported varieties at Home and at
Foreign are

The log deviation of marginal cost terms are similar to those in Fujiwara and Wang (2017),
but now they involve the consumption tax terms, b
tc;t and b
tc;t . The intuition is straight

forward. The tax will distort the consumption choice and has an impact on wages, which
is eventually re‡ected in marginal cost. The …rst two terms represent the e¤ect of output
and the productivity shock on production while the third term is related to the e¤ect of
terms of trade on marginal cost (relative to the producer price index). The fourth term is
the (after-tax) deviation from the law of one price. Note that compared to Engel (2011),
it now includes a log tax term due to the presence of the consumption tax. The …fth
term is the di¤erence between the consumption tax across countries. Comparing the third
and the …fth term, we can see that the role of the tax rate di¤erence on marginal cost is
identical to that of the term of trade. This is intuitive. Also, these two terms will only
a¤ect the marginal cost when

> 1:

Finally, there exists a sixth term, the consumption tax, in Equations (4.29) and (4.30),
implying the tax will a¤ect marginal cost relative to the foreign producer price index
directly. This is because when prices facing consumers are a¤ected by the consumption tax
(subsidy), the export …rms’price setting will be distorted. In other word, the consumption
taxes (subsidies), although correcting the deviations from law of one price, distorts the
16

production decision, which in turn a¤ects the relative real marginal cost of imported goods.
To eliminate this distortion, we need to impose a producer subsidy (tax) on export …rms.

4.3

Introducing Export Subsidies

Export subsidies will be proportional to the export prices, since export goods will be
taxed by the importing consumers government. Speci…cally, when home …rms export to
the foreign country, they will receive a subsidy se;t proportional to their sales revenue.
Given the proposed export subsidies, the objective functions of …rms in the home and
foreign countries will change accordingly.

In the following analysis, we will …rst derive the global loss function with tax and
subsidy for the cooperative game. We check if these …scal instruments can correct the
welfare loss due to deviation from LOOP and help to achieve the ‡exible price equilibrium.
17

Note that in the dynamic model, the most desirable level to which monetary policy can
deliver is the ‡exible price equilibrium level, which will be used as a target for international
tax policies. Since we remove the monopolistic competition by a constant tax, it is also
the e¢ cient equilibrium, as that in Fujiwara and Wang (2017).

5

The Cooperative Equilibrium

Since the e¤ect of currency misalignment on marginal cost does not depend on whether
is greater, smaller, or equal to 1, we will look at the

= 1 …rst to simplify our analysis.

This also helps to compare with the loss function in Section 1. The case with

> 1 will

be discussed later.

5.1

The Cooperative Game when

=1

We …rst look at the case of cooperative policy when

= 1. In this case, it is assumed that

there exists an authority who will choose monetary and …scal instruments to maximize
the joint (global) welfare of the home and foreign country. As shown in the Technical
Appendix, the second-order approximation of global welfare L0 = Lh;0 + Lh;0 , after the
introduction of a consumption tax and export subsidy is:

These terms are identical to the loss function derived from the standard model except for

and Fujiwara and Wang, 2017), in our model with …scal instruments, they show up in the
loss function together with the consumption tax.

The domestic output gap is de…ned as deviation from the natural level of output (the output level in the ‡exible price equilibrium) Yet = Ybt Yb f , where notations with superscript
t

"f " denote the variables in ‡exible price equilibrium.

Proposition 1 In the cooperative game with = 1, consumption tax rates are chosen to
correct deviations from law of one price dbt and dbt , whereas export subsidy rates are used to

o¤ set the corresponding externality of the consumption tax. The optimal monetary policy
requires monetary authorities to target zero PPI in‡ation and a zero output gap.

The proof is given in the Technical Appendix. The global welfare loss comes from the
output gap, in‡ation instability and the deviation from LOOP. Engel (2011) provides a
19

solution for this cooperative game without tax and subsidy. He …nds that the optimal
solution is to target zero CPI in‡ation instead of PPI in‡ation, since policymakers cannot
eliminate "currency misalignment" due to LCP. Thus, even with policy coordination the
optimal monetary policy cannot replicate the ‡exible price equilibrium. In our model,
however, once the international tax and subsidy scheme are introduced to correct the
distortion induced by the deviation from LOOP, the social planner can achieve an e¢ cient equilibrium, which is identical to that under ‡exible prices or PCP (under optimal
monetary policy).
Given the above optimal policies, what exactly are the deviations of LOOP and the
…scal policies in this dynamic model? Zero PPI in‡ation, or hh;t = hf;t = 0, implies
db = Sb .9 Similarly, db = Sb . Substituting this relation, solution to the cooperative game,
t

and the expression for qbt into Equation (5.39) gives dbt = dbt = t
t and tax schemes
10 In other words, consumption tax rates are exactly the gap between
b

tc;t = t
t:
home and foreign productivity shocks. The Phillips curves (5.36) and (5.38) indicate

that the in‡ation dynamics of imported goods are directly a¤ected by consumption tax

rates. So to o¤set this externality, export subsidies sbe;t and sbe;t eliminate the impact of
consumption taxes on in‡ation of imported goods. Finally, Sbt = t
t implies that the

exchange rate is ‡exible and responds to productivity shocks in the same manner as that
under PCP.

5.2

Cooperative Game when

As discussed above, when

> 1, the terms of trade e¤ect and the risk-sharing e¤ect will

enter the loss function. There will also be some spillover e¤ect of international productivity.
In Section 1 of the Appendix, we present the loss function and the constraints faced by the
social planner for the cooperative game in the

> 1; although there exists an international productivity spillover in the game,

the consumption tax will still correct the deviation from LOOP and the export subsidy
will still o¤set the distortion of consumption tax on allocation. Given that the currency
misalignment induced by LCP is corrected by the tax, the optimal monetary policy will
still target zero PPI in‡ation. Due to the presence of international spillover, a country’s
equilibrium output does not re‡ect exactly the its corresponding productivity shock, but
the output gap, properly de…ned, is still zero. Therefore, even when

> 1, we can still

have the following result. The combination of international tax policy and an inwardlooking monetary policy targeting PPI in‡ation can correct the currency misalignment
and replicate the ‡exible price equilibrium.

11

Having shown that these …scal instruments can correct the currency misalignment due
to LCP and deliver the ‡exible price equilibrium under the cooperative game, the next
step is to explore the implementation of these international …scal policies.
11

If there is no home bias ( = 1), we can show that the optimal solutions are identical to the responses

under ‡exible price equilibrium in the static model of Devereux and Engel (2003). The optimal output

Non-cooperative Game and Implementability

We …rst ask if the solution to the international tax non-cooperative game exists. If not,
then we ask what kind of condition on the …scal instruments is needed to ensure the
existence of a Nash international monetary game.

6.1

Non-existence of Nash Game on Tax Policies

De…ne the non-cooperative game as one where the policy-maker in each country independently chooses both monetary variables and …scal variables. Again, …rst focus on the case
= 1. In this section, following Benigno and Woodford (2005) and Fujiwara and Wang
(2017), we use a second-order approximation methods to derive individual country loss
functions and characterize the conditions for a non-cooperative equilibrium. Here we just
sketch the main steps for the derivation and leave the details to the Technical Appendix.
The home household’s lifetime expected utility can be approximated up to the second
order as

The third term in the bracket represents the log consumption volatility and the fourth
term is just the output gap. Both can be derived from …rst-order approximation of the

system. However, to get C

we …rst log-linearize the system around the zero in‡ation, zero tax/subsidy steady state

without monopolistic distortions. Then using this log-linearized system, we can get the
second-order approximation of the AS equations (the four price indices) and the market
bt L

clearing conditions, which will allow us to express C
and in‡ation.

Proposition 2 The equilibrium of non-cooperative international tax Nash game does not
exist.
The proof is given in the Technical Appendix. When deriving the loss function of each

country, the linear terms C

but also the terms of trade

qbt which is absent in the closed economy. Thus, each central

bank in an open economy has incentive to strategically manipulate the terms of trade
in its favour. This represents the term of trade externality as analyzed in Corsetti and

Pesenti (2001), Benigno (2002) and Benigno and Benigno (2006). In our framework with

Therefore, linear terms (b

sbe;t ) and are part of term of trade externality. Each country

has the incentive to manipulate this term and increase domestic households’welfare. From
the home loss function P(2), we see that at the initial point where (b
tc;t sbe;t ) = 0, the

home country would have an incentive to increase E(b
tc;t

sbe;t ), which would reduce its

expected loss, since this would raise its expected terms of trade. This is re‡ected in the

optimal subsidy sbe;t .

So the home government would wish to have E(b

Ybt
t = 0 and dt + tc;t = 0, this would imply that f h;t cannot converge to zero, even
2

in the absence of productivity shocks. In fact, as shown in the technical appendix, any
solution to the non-cooperative game must have
24

f h;t

diverging to in…nity. Therefore,

there is no equilibrium with …nite in‡ation rates. As a result there is a fundamental
inconsistency between the policymakers goal of in‡ation control and the desire to exploit
its terms of trade advantage in the non-cooperative game where each policymaker has
responsibility for both monetary policy and …scal instruments.

6.2

Implementability in a Three-player Nash Game

Is there any restriction that could help to regain the Nash equilibrium? Obviously, from
the analysis above, one natural restriction would be sbe;t = b
tc;t and sbe;t = b
tc;t . By arti…cially
imposing a restriction on tax policy such that the home consumption tax exactly equals

the export subsidy for foreign exporters, the terms of trade externality due to international
tax competition externality can be avoided. After this restriction is imposed, there will
be a solution to the restricted Nash game and it replicates the ‡exible price equilibrium.
Proposition 3 With the restriction that b
tc;t = sbe;t and b
tc;t = sbe;t ; the non-cooperative
equilibrium exists. It also replicates the ‡exible equilibrium. That is, the solutions to the
restricted Nash game are the same as those in the cooperative game.

Proofs are given the Technical Appendix. Thus, we conclude that even under the
non-cooperative game, the international tax policy combined by the consumption tax and
export subsidy can be used to replicate the ‡exible price equilibrium and improve global
welfare.
How can this condition be rationalized? We now de…ne a mixed environment where
there is cooperation in …scal policy but non-cooperative monetary policy.
To achieve this goal, we distinguish between …scal authorities and monetary authorities.
Instead of assuming that the monetary authorities choose the level of tax or subsidies, we
assume that they take the tax and subsidies policy rules as given, but choose in‡ation and
output gaps independently (non-cooperatively). Meanwhile, the …scal authorities choose
the optimal responses of tax and subsidies. But to avoid the terms of trade externality
in the choice of …scal instruments, …scal policies must be chosen cooperatively. Hence, we
de…ne a 3 player Nash game, where there are two monetary authorities and a global …scal
alliance.
25

The objective functions and constraints of the home and foreign monetary authorities
are identical to the problem characterized by P(2), the only di¤erence is that b
tc;t ; sbe;t and

b
tc;t ; sbe;t are not their choice variables. The objective function of global …scal authorities,

as well as the constraint, is identical to the problem characterized by P(1) but they can
only choose the tax and subsidies instruments.

Proposition 4 The solution to the 3 player Nash game is the same as those in the cooperative game. In other words, e¤ ective …scal policy coordination in tax policies among
governments is necessary for non-cooperative ( or self-oriented) monetary policy to sustain
an e¢ cient outcome.
Proofs are given the Technical Appendix. Intuitively, …scal authorities can use the
consumption tax to correct the welfare costs due to currency misalignment and ensure
that this consumption tax will not a¤ect the in‡ation rate, by using export subsidies.
The governments can implement this …scal scheme without coordinating with the monetary authorities. In e¤ect, coordination between …scal authorities is more desirable than
coordination between monetary authorities, from the perspective of correcting currency
misalignment.12
Clarida, Gali and Gertler (2002) show that when

= 1, there is no gain from policy

coordination under PCP framework. In our model, once the deviation of law of one
price due to LCP is corrected by the international tax coordination there is no extra
gain from monetary policy cooperation. This implication di¤ers from Fujiwara and Wang
(2017), where they …nd that there is some policy coordination gain from monetary policy
coordination under LCP. This is because, in our model, once the currency misalignment
is corrected, the optimal monetary policy can again target producer price stability, as in
the case of PCP. Therefore, the optimal monetary and …scal policy mix delivers the same
results under both the cooperative game and non-cooperative game, which is the ‡exible
price equilibrium under PCP. In our model, the key policy coordination gain is from the
12

We note again that …scal policy to deal with the welfare loss due to local currency pricing is also

proposed by Adao, Correia, and Teles (2009). The key di¤erence here however it that optimal tax policy is derived from three-player Nash game among coordinated …scal alliance, home and foreign money
authorities.

26

…scal policy coordination. We discuss this in Section 7, where we de…ne the welfare gain
as the di¤erence between welfare under the LCP case without …scal policy and the ‡exible
price equilibrium.

6.3

> 1 case

We also check if the results discussed above hold when

> 1. Section 2 and 3 of the

Appendix give the loss function and constraints faced by players for the restricted Nash
game and for the three-player Nash game. We show that both Nash games deliver exactly
the same solution as that in the cooperative game. The proof is given in the Technical
Appendix. This implies that for a more general setup, we can still show that the combination of monetary policy and state-contingent taxes and subsidies can be used to eliminate
the ine¢ ciency caused by LCP and replicate the ‡exible price equilibrium.
In summary, we show that even under the non-cooperative Nash game, a state-contingent
tax policy combination of consumption tax (subsidy) and export subsidy (tax) can fully
correct the currency misalignment due to LCP. But critically, this requires cooperation in
…scal policy. The independent determination of taxes and subsidies, while allowing policymakers to eliminate currency misalignment, opens up a new strategic channel through
the terms of trade externality which, as we have shown, is inconsistent with the desire to
eliminate output gaps and achieve zero in‡ation.

Quantitative Welfare Gain

In this section, we give a quantitative evaluation of the gains to employing state contingent
…scal policies to correct currency misalignment. We can de…ne the welfare gain as the
welfare achieved under the fully e¢ cient allocation (which can be supported under the
3 player Nash game), relative to the welfare under a non-cooperative monetary policy
equilibrium, without the use of …scal policies. This latter equilibrium is that analyzed by
Fujiwara and Wang (2017).
As shown above, when optimal, state-contingent …scal policies are used, the economy
can achieve the fully e¢ cient allocations. Hence, from one perspective, the welfare loss

of currency misalignment in Engel (2011), which cannot be eliminated by the optimal
monetary policy (CPI targeting), can be taken as the welfare improvement of our policy
mix, relative to the optimal cooperative monetary policy derived in Engel (2011). To
obtain a quantitative welfare improvement, we conduct a simple quantitative exercise
following Engel (2011). All parameters are documented in Table 2 and identical to that
in Engel (2011). We compare the welfare (in terms of steady state consumption) under
optimal monetary policy in Engel (2011) and that in ‡exible price equilibrium. The welfare
loss under the e¢ cient, ‡exible price equilibrium is -0.0168% while the loss under CPI
targeting under optimal cooperative monetary policy is -0.0442%. The di¤erence is due
to the presence of currency misalignment, which implies that even under the cooperative
game the households have to give up 0.0274% of their steady state consumption compared
with the welfare under the ‡exible price allocation.

13

Moreoever, if we compare our result

with that in Fujiwara and Wang (2017), the non-cooperative monetary game under LCP,
the welfare gain from …scal policy, or more speci…cally …scal coordination, is actually even
higher, equal to around 0.0468% of consumer’s steady state consumption.

misalignment under LCP. Figure 1 indicates that the welfare gains by correcting the
"currency misalignment" are larger when the frequency to change price is lower. Figure 2
documents that the welfare gains relative to cooperative monetary policy are largest when
there is no home bias (v = 1). As shown in the cooperative game, the welfare loss due to
currency misalignment is simply given by v(2 v) [(db )2 + (db )2 ]. Therefore, when v = 1, the

welfare loss reaches the maximum. Also, from this equation, when the economy is closed
(at v = 0 or v = 2), and only consumes one good, the welfare loss is zero, since there is
no distortion from "currency misalignment".

Discussion

Other Tax Instruments

In this subsection, we introduce some other tax instruments discussed in the literature,
particularly that used in Adao, Correia, and Teles (2009). They show that a labor income
tax and consumption taxes on both home goods and foreign goods can be used to replicate
the ‡exible prices equilibrium. And given these taxes, the exchange rate regime and the
currency of pricing is irrelevant. It should be noted that since we assume complete risk
sharing, our setting di¤ers from theirs in terms of asset market completeness. But it is
still important to ascertain whether these particular …scal instruments can be used in
our dynamic pricing setting model to replicate the ‡exible price equilibrium. The model
speci…cation is similar to the benchmark dynamic model, so we only list a few key equations
which change when various tax instruments are considered.

The foreign counterparts are de…ned analogously. We then check if these instruments
can replicate the ‡exible price equilibrium. For simplicity and the purpose of comparison,
we focus on the case where

= 1. We …rst look at the cooperative game. As shown in

the Technical Appendix, the solution to the cooperative game is as follows:

This solution indeed establishes that the ‡exible price equilibrium can be achieved
using these instruments under a cooperative game. This is consistent with Adao, Correa
and Teles (2009), although we have a di¤erent international …nancial market structure in
our model. However, two things should be noted. First, the level of the home and foreign
31

labor income tax is indeterminate. The need to eliminate currency misalignment requires
for instance that dt + b
th;t b
th;t = 0 and b
th;t + bt = 0, but we cannot uniquely pin down
the individual tax rates. Both home and foreign consumers are subject to the same tax

responses on home goods, and similarly for the tax responses on foreign goods. The labor
income tax is used to o¤set the supply e¤ects of the tax rates, similarly to the role of the
export subsidy in our previous model. But what matters in terms of adjusting relative
demand e¢ ciently is the di¤erence between the tax on home goods and that on foreign
goods, not the individual tax rates.
Second, the exchange rate has to be …xed. Once the responses of taxes on home and
foreign goods have been put in place, nominal prices do not move, and since the taxes
respond identically for both home and foreign consumers, any movement in the exchange
rate would in fact generate a deviation from the law of one price. To eliminate this, we
require the exchange rate to be …xed.
We then explore if the ‡exible price equilibrium can be supported in the non-cooperative
Nash game. As discussed in the Technical appendix, it cannot. In fact, we arrive at a
non-existence condition exactly as in our main model, because individual authorities would
wish to have a non-zero expected labor tax, leading to no …nite equilibrium level of in‡ation. Hence, as in our main model, these instruments cannot be used to replicate the
‡exible price equilibrium in a non-cooperative …scal policy game. Some further restrictions
or international cooperation would be needed.

Conclusion

This paper shows that international tax policy can be used to correct the ine¢ ciency
problem due to nominal rigidities and local currency pricing in the open economy. We …nd
that a state-contingent tax policy combination of consumption tax (subsidy) and export
subsidy (tax) can fully eliminate the problem of currency misalignment (deviations from
the law of one price), and combined with a monetary policy that leads the exchange rate to
respond to productivity shocks, achieves the ‡exible price allocation. But this monetary
…scal mix cannot be decentralized in an environment of fully ‘self-reliant’ monetary and
…scal policy. The reason is that the non-cooperative use of taxes and subsidies to o¤set
32

the ine¢ ciencies of currency misalignment opens up a strategic ine¢ ciency in a noncooperative setting which leads to a fundamental con‡ict between the goals of output gap
and in‡ation stabilization and terms of trade manipulation. The implementation of an
e¢ cient monetary-…scal mix requires e¤ective cooperation in …scal policy, while leaving
monetary policy to be determined non-cooperatively.
