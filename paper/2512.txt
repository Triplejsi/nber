Randomness

in Tax Enforcement

ABSTRACT

For moSt parameter values, Increased randomness about how auch taxaole
income an auditor
assess leads to higher reported Income arid more
revenue, When reducing randomness
costly, optimailty requires some
randomness in assessed taxable Income. Fven
reducing randomness
costless, taxpayers may prefer some randomness when the increased revenue can

for binding decisions on tax issues, these decisions have no eievance or
other taxpayers, and the egai fees involved are often in the neighbo—nood
of $10,000. We assume trat, due to costliress, taxpayers do not often taKe
auvantage of this.

Randomness could also be reduced by changing the tax law itself.
Por example, the U.S.
Treasury Department's tax reform proposal of Novemper,
1984, Tax Reform for Fai,Simplicity, and Economic Growth, stressed
the rnportance of simplifying tre tax code,
it further recognized tnat
simplicity in taxation has several dimensions, among them that 'under a
simple system, most responsible taxpayers would be more certain of their
tax liapilities."
If the tax code is truly unclear in its details, then
an ex post appeal to the Tax Court is just another lottery (a'though it
better to have two chances for a victory than one). Stil , tre decision
of the Tax Court is unpredictable.

Our earlier paper (1987) gives examples to show that optma enforcement
may or may not require a trivially small probability of audit, and infinitely high variance in assessed ncome.

We assume that the increased revenue is returned to taxpayers as a lump sum
rebate, rather than as a owered tax rate. This simp'cation nas been

A report
of m±d always dominates e larger report, because we assume fines

the texpeyer is not audited, and has no advantage when the texpeyer is audited.
We allow the texpeyer to report negetive income. As one can see
from the first—order conditions (4) end (5) below, the texpeyer will not
do so if it forces income in the state of the world that he is audited and
assessed high to be close to zero, provided the merginel utility of income
