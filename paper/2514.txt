Introduction

General equilibrium analysis of labor unions has taken place
primarily within the context of closed— or small—open—economy versions
of the two—sector neoclassIcal model.

The early contributIons to this

literature introduce an exogenous union wage premium In one sector and
consider the Implications for various properties of the general
equilibrium.!t

Several recent papers have made endogenous the

actions

of

the labor union in an effort to understand both the way unions respond
to changing international conditions and the implications of union
behavior for broader comparative statics results,! What has not been
considered formally is the effect of union activity on the international
location of production and the pattern of international trade:

that Is,

the simultaneous determination of the union wage and the set of products
produced by union workers.
By modeling the union as operating In an Import—competing sector
that produces a variety of heterogeneous goods, this paper explores the
union's impact on the pattern of trade and, at the same time, the effect
on union wages of shifting international patterns of production

In

particular, It goods within the union sector differ in the intensity
with which they require union labor, and if the (domestic) union wage
premium Is an important source of international cost differences, then
be
only the least labor—intensive range of union—sector goods will

produced abroad as a result of the relatively high cost of domestic
union labor.

—2—
intensity, the Identity of the "marginal" good——the good of highest
labor Intensity that is produoed In the domestic union sector——will be
determined by the sIze of the domestIc union wage premium:

it defines

the scope of domestic production in the union sector, and hence the
range of domestic export goods, as a function of union behavior.
However, the scope of domestic union—sector production will itself
affect the sectoral labor intensity of production, on which the wage
premium of a rent-maximizing union depends.1"

As such, when a union

supplies labor for the production of heterogeneous goods, the union wage
premium and the pattern of international trade will be determined
simultaneously.
The key ingredients of the formal model developed below to explore
the link between trade patterns and union behavior are that countries
differ only with respect to their degree

of'

union activity, that goods

produced with union labor are heterogeneous in the intensity with which
their production requires w-iion labor, and that there is a single labor
union setting a uniform wage across goods of the "union sector."

The

first assumption is extreme, but represents a modeling technique that
has proved useful in highlighting the contributions of such determinants
as endowments and technology to the pattern

of'

international trade../

The second assumption approximates an industry—wide union, such as the
United Auto Workers or the United Steel Workers, whose members produce a
variety

of'

products.

Finally, the assumption of a single union is made

to keep the model simple.

Extending the model to include many unions

operating within the union sector is discussed in a footnote.

—3—

The particular

framework

upon which

the

analysis

15 a variant

rests

of the two—country continuum—of-goods Ricardian model of Dornbusch,

Fischer, and Samuelson (1977), and is similar in some respects to the
model developed in Dixit and Grossman (1982).

There are two final—goods

sectors and a non—traded Intermediate good sector.

In the union sector,

firms combine unionized labor and the intermediate good in different
proportions to produce the various goods of the sector.

For

concreteness, this sector might be thought of as the automobile
industry, the union as the UAW, and the various goods within the sector
as the array of different models produced.

The goods in the non—union

sector are produced with combinations of non—union labor and the
Intermediate good and can, without loss of generality, be ag'egated
into one non—union good.

The intermediate good is non—traded and is

produced in the intermediate good sector with non—union labor alone.

To

neutralize any Ricardian basis for international trade, technological
differences between countries that would lead to comparative advantage
are assumed to be absent:

only the operation of a labor union in the

domestic country distinguishes it from the foreign country.

Finally,

the domestic labor union is assumed to organize workers in the domestic
union sector and to choose a single rent-maximizing wage at which Its
members will be hired to produce the heterogeneous goods of the sector.
The relationship between the union wage premium and the pattern of
production and trade that emerges from this model has important
implications for the model's comparative statics results.

Since the

aggregate labor intensity of the domestic union sector Is increasing In

—14—

the scope of domestic production, the wage premium of a rent-maxinizing
doemstic labor Uflion will rise in response to increased "1ntensity' of
foreign competition.

Consequently, the scope of domestic production

takes on a sIgnificance of its own, and the effects of labor migration,
demand shifts, and technological change will be altered according to
their respective impacts on domestic production.

In this way, union

activity can alter in a systematIc way the standard comparative statics
results familiar from competitive Ricardian trade theory.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows,

After developing

the model in section II, section III illustrates the effect of an active
union on comparative statics results of the Ricardian model by
considering the union response to a decline In demand for union
products, to a policy of directing R&D efforts into the union sector,
and to international labor migration.

II.

Section IV concludes.

The Model

The continuum—of-goods Ricardian model of Dornbusch, Fischer, and
Samuelson (1977) yields strong comparative statics results concerning
the effects of changes in technology, tastes, and national labor
endowments on the terms of trade, relative and real wages, and the scope
of production in each of the two countries of the model.

A convenient

graphical representation of the model is developed by the authors to
provide a simple and intuitive method for determining the equilibrium
and generating comparative statics results.

Union Wage Premium Exogenous
Located in each of the two countries of the model are two final
goods sectors and an intermediate good sector.

The Intermediate good,

whIch will be called "capital" and which is nontraded by assumption, is
used as an input into the production of final goods, and is produced
with non—union labor alone according to a linear homogenous technology
common to both countries.

The two traded—goods sectors employ labor and capital to produce
final goods for consumption.

Consider first the domestic economy.

Goods of the non-union sector are produced with combinations of nonunion labor and capital according to linear homogenous technologies.
Since the relative price of factors used in this sector Is fixed by (1),

Under the assumption that subutility over the

non—union goods is homothetic, a composite non—union good can be defined
whose production requires inputs of capital and non—union labor in fixed
p'oportions.

This composite non—union good will be called good 2.

The union sector contains a continuum of goods indexed by

zcCO,1

and produced under constant returns to scale by combining capital and
union labor in fixed proportions. The assumption of Leontief
technologies in the union sector is primarily for graphical convenience,
though its implications for the endogenous determination of the union
wage premium will be discussed below./

Therefore, foreign labor gains In real terms from the

because the

Model

Union Behavior

The potential Importance of making endogenous the pattern of
production and trade from the standpoint of determIning the effects of
foreign competition on union wage—setting behavIor Is brought out by
noting that trade will have two opposing effects on the optimal union
wage premium in this model.

On the one hand, the union wage will be

constrained by international trade through a higher elasticity of
derived demand for union labor:

this results from the international

relocation of production that would occur at the margin in response to
further increases In the union wage.

On the other hand, the goods whose

production does remain at home will be those that use relatively
unintenslvely the services of union labor, and the average labor
intensity of production in the union sector will decline:

this effect

tends to reduce the elasticity of derived demand for union labor, and
consequently leads to a higher union wage.

If the former effect is

invariant with respect to the scope of domestic production, then through
the latter effect, "Intensification" of foreign competition which
manifests itself in a narrower scope of domestic production will bring
about a higher union wage premium, since the increased competition from
abroad weeds out precisely those firms whose relatively intensive use of

As Krugman (1987) has noted, the case for industrial targeting
stands or falls with the ability to Identify sectors that "ought" to be
targeted, where targeting is understood to imply a policy of affecting
the sectoral pattern of investment rather than its aggregate level.
Since the choice of the targeted sector will have Implications for the
scope of domestic union production in the model of section II, it will
also affect the union wage premium.

This In turn can provide a reason

to alter the sectoral mix of investment through a policy of Industrial
targeting.
As an illustration of this point, consider the choice between

Thus, from the standpoint of the direct effect of R&D, there

is no basis upon which to favor one sector over the other.

If the non—union sector were targeted, all benefits would be
captured in this direct effect:

Labor Migration
International labor mIgration can be represented in the model as a
change In

.

In

the competitIve model explored in Dornbusch,

Fischer, and Samuelson (1977), labor migration from the low wage to the
high wage country would reallocate the world stock of labor toward the
country whose marginal—good technology iS most efficient.

This serves

to expand the world production possIbilities frontier, and makes labor
in the low wage country better off, though the (original) Inhabitants of
the high wage country suffer a welfare decline.

Of course, the

expansion of world production possibilities ensures that the gainers
could compensate the losers.

Findlay (1982) has argued in the context

of a Ricardian model that, with regard to several well-known notIons of
distributive justice, free trade cum migration is "just" in that it at
once expands the world production possibilities and brings about a more
equal international distribution of Income.
In the model of section II, the consequences of labor migration in
response to International wage differentials can be quite different.
First, the union can cause the less efficient country to have the high
non—union wage, so that (non—union) labor migration in the dIrection of
higher wages contracts the world production possibilities frontier.
Moreover, In response to this migration abroad, the scope of domestic

Conclualon

CompetitIve trade theory suggests that freely working market forces
in a world economy will determine optimally the international locatIon
of production, and that a country engaged in trade need have no

addItional concerns over the Identity of sectors operating within Its
borders. WhIle recent literature has questioned this result, and points
toward the potentIal national benefits of the domestic location of
sectors with

certain

attributes, the focus has been primarily on product

markets." Moreover,
there

is

nothing Inherently perverse about the free

trade allocation of productIon across countries in this literature:
there simply exist certain sectors that all countries would rather have
operating within their borders.
This paper has focused on the exIstence of an optimizing labor
union,
the

and has explored the InteractIon between union wage demands and

International pattern of production and trade. In the model

considered,

the scope of domestic production takes on a special welfare

siificance of

its own, since it determines in a systematic way the

characteristics of the set of firms served by the trade union.

A

broader scope of production at home is associated with a lower domestic
union wage premium, while an 'intensification" of foreign competition
leads to a hIgher domestic union premium.
As illustrated in section III, this relationship implies several
conclusions concerning the effects of changes in the international
environment which lead to shifts in the international pattern of
production.

First, a shift in preferences away from union sector goods

—

and

into the

non—union

3'

—

goods of the dcmesti3 oountry will, in driving up

the domestia non—union wage relative to the wage abroad, diminish the
scope of domestic union sector production and hence reduce the sectore.l
labor intensity of produ2tion: this leads to a rise in the rent—
maximizing domestia mien wage premium. As such, the model predicts a

rising union premium in the face of declining demand for union
products. Seconc, directing domestic R&D efforts toward the union
seotor will expand the scope of anion producticn and reduce the union
premium, while R&D in the non-union sector leaves the scope of union
sector production, and hence union behavior, unohangedi this raises the
possibility of welfare gains from a progrsm of union sector targeting.
Finally, international labor migration can have very different effects
when a labor union is present. In patioular, the presence of a union in
the technologically more advanced country can cause migration of nonunion labor to occur in the direction of the less advanced oountry.
Moreover, as this migration takes place, the union wage premium is
driven up, of festting the welfare gains of migration to the remaining
non—union population in the domestic country.
inveres relationship between scope of production and the uni3n
premium which emerges from this model depends critically on the notion
The

that international differences in union activity are an important

Groseman (1982)

has fooused on modeling the response of union wage demands to an
increase in international competition when the union follows a

seniority layoff and rehiring rule. His results suggest that such
hiring rules could be responsible for the empirical observation
that seotoral wages often fail to fall in response to a reduction

in the price of competing import goods. The results of this paper
provide an alternative explanation for such wage behavior.
The effect of capital intensity on the derived demand elasticity
for labor is often cited as one explanation of greater union
activity in more capital intensive sectors. For empirical evidence
on this relationship, see, for example, Hirsch and Berger (198*).

differences as the determinant of trade patterns, while Hecksoher—
