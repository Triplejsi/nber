AACT
This paper

derives statements

of the Heckscher—Ohlin Theorem which

remain valid In the presence of

market

power.

Following Helpman

(1981a), the paper explores restrictions on permissible trade patterns
that are Implied by the post—trade equilibrium conditions of Heckscher—
Ohlin theory.

Restrictions on the patterns or commodity trade are

derived to complement Helpman's factor content version or the
competitive Heckscher—Ohlin theory, and the introduction or factor
market power is shown to leave the validity or these restrictions
unaffected.

Restrictions on the pattern or Heckscher—Ohlin trade in the

presence of product market power are also derived, and conditions are
stated

under which Helpman's competitive factor content restrictions

continue to

hold.

Introduction

Efforts to generalize the predictions of the Heckscher—Ohlin (HO)
model of international trade have received a great deal of attention in
recent years.

and

homothetic can be found in

These predictIons take the form of correlations among

autarky factor prices, factor intensities, and multilateral trade in
goods and, like the standard HO predictions, can be stated in either a
commodity or a factor content version.

Such results are important in

that they demonstrate the implications of what Is perhaps the
fundamental assumption of HO theory——the international availability of
technology——without many of the additional assumptions that have made
the empirical relevance of the standard model suspect.
One assumption that Is needed for Deardorff's results is that of
perfectly competitive markets.

Especially in light of the

'owing

interest in the causes and implications of international trade in the
presence of various forms of non-competitive markets, a generalization
of Deardorff's results to a world of non—competitive markets would be
useful.

Unfortunately, such a generalization seems unlikely, at least

until general gains—from-trade results in the presence of market power
become available.

This is because, as emphasized by Deardorff (p. 688),

the derivation of his results rely heavily on the existence of gains
from trade.

Since a general gains—from—trade theorem in the presence of

market power is not available, it is not clear how or even if

equilibrium of an m—firm oligopoly, with m/2 firms operating in each of
the two countries of a two-country world.

Suppose that firms in the

oligopoly sector have incurred some sunk cost and produce at constant
marginal cost, all other sectors in the two countries behaving
competitively.

In the absence of impediments to trade, the equilibrium

(world) market share of each of the m firms will depend on
costs.

Its

In particular, If at post—trade equilibrium factor prices the

cost of production in the oligopoly sector differs in the two countries,
the m/2 firms operating in the lower cost country will have relatively
high markups, and will individually and as a group capture a larger
share of the (world) market than the m/2 firms operating in the high
cost country.

If demand for the good is divided equally over the two

countries, then the country with high—markup firms will be a net
exporter of the good.

With this the only non—competitive sector by

assumption, condition (13) wIll be satisfied, and Helpman's factor
content restrictions will remain valid.
Condition (13) is an equilibrium restriction on the interaction
between the pattern and degree of product market power and the pattern
of commodity trade which,

It'

satisfied, will ensure that the existence

of product market power does not invalidate the implications of the
competitive HO theory as derived by Helpman.

While various market

structures may satisfy (13) and thus leave in tact the implications of
the competitive HO theory, whether (13) is in fact satist'ied is largely
an empirical question.

As such, this corollary points to the Importance

Helpman assumes the absence of Intermediate inputs into production,
and the same assumptIon will be made throughout this paper.
However, all the results of this paper can be shown to hold in a
world with traded intermediate goods as long as there are no
Intermediate good tariffs or transport costs, and provided that the
factor content of trade is measured on a direct basis, i.e.,
excluding the factor content of intermediate inputs. For a
discussion of the role of intermediate goods, see Staiger (1986).
In this case, the factor content of country j's exports of good
n can be calculated as the quantity of exports multIplIed by the
content of one unit of good n produced In
average
country j. Similarly, industry markups can be interpreted as the
markup of price above average cost, and would thus continue to
represent unit economic profits. The condItions in this paper
would then allow observed data to be checked for consistency with
the equilibrium conditions of HO theory in the presence of such
scale economies.
