February 1988

Has State Redistribution Policy
Grown More Conservative?

ABSTRACT
It is well—known that real benefits in the major cash transfer program in
the U.S.——the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program——have
fallen drastically over the past twenty years.

State legislatures, which set

AFDC benefit levels, have failed to increase nominal benefits to keep up with
inflation, resulting in a 25 percent decline in real benefits between 1960 and
1984.

The most popular explanation for this decline is that state

legislatures, reflecting the changing preferences of voters, have grown more
conservative in their tastes for redistribution.

The evidence presented in

this paper is consistent instead with a different explanation, that
legislatures have let federally—financed Food Stamps displace state—financed
AFDC benefits.

A similar displacement of AFDC by Medicaid benefits appears to

have occurred.

Aside from implying that preferences for redistribution have

not in fact changed, the results also show that the total transfer benefit has
increased, as should be expected from growing income levels.

The findings

also imply that neither the Food Stamp program nor, presumably, any other
lump—sum transfer provided by Congress is likely to have any effect on the
incomes of the poor female-head population.

one—for—one

The decline in real AFOC benefits thus could be a result of the

increase in Food Stamp benefits that occurred over the 1970s and 1980s.

—2—
This hypothesis has been examined previously by Huiten et al. (1982),
Gramiich (1982), Orr (1979), and plotnick and Winters (1985).

Orr found that

Food Stamps substituted for AFDC benefits on a one—for-one basis while
Gramlich and Piotnick—Winters found there to be no substitution.

Hulten at

al. found evidence of substitution but stressed the extreme non—robustness of
the models that have been used,

The variance in results in these studies may

be, in part, a reflection of a key difficulty in testing the hypothesis.

The

Food Stamp benefit schedule is uniform in the nation as a whole, hence a
cross—Section regression of state—specific AFDC benefits on a standardized
Food Stamp benefit is not possible.

Moreover, the number of time periods

available over the 1970s and 1980s is too small to conduct a reliable time—
series analysis, and the evidence is strong that the states were not in
equilibrium in those years anyway.

The previous studies attempted to

circumvent this problem by using various sources of cross—sectional variation

in the Food Stamp benefit actually paid out in a state to achieve
identification of the Food Stamp substitution effect.

However, the validity

of using such variation to measure the substitution effect is subject to
question and, in any case, the amount of such variation is small.
In this paper a more direct method of attack is taken.

Cross-sectional

regressions of PFDC benefits are estimated at a point in time (1960)

prior to

the introduction of Food Stamps, and the results are then used to forecast the
sum of AFDC and Food Stamps at a later time (viz., in 1984).

If the

substitution hypothesis is correct, the 1960 regression should correctly
forecast the later sum.

This method, while direct, is also fairly heroic.

Time—series forecasts from cross—sectional regressions are

Sut the possibly quixotic nature of the exercise also sakes it a

The results indicate surprisingly strong support for the substitution

differences find that the null of no structural change cannot be rejected.

the AFOC benefit, and in variables that might have caused its decline, are

TIME-SERIES AND INSTITUTIONAL BAQCGROUND

A relative brief graphical exposition of the relevant trends should
provide a proper context for the econometric work.

the real benefit grew steadily into the early 196Ds and

accelerated slightly in the mid—1960s.

But around 1967 or 1968, the benefit

increase came to a halt and benefits took a sharp nosedive, setting off a fall
which continued all the way to 1981

Since

end has remained essentially constant.
That changes in the U.S. politicsl climate leading to more conservative
policies occurred at about the same time as the benefit decline leads to the
obvious hypothesis that the benefit reduction has resulted from changes in
preferences toward redistribution.

State legislatures, which set AFOC

benefits, are traditionally more conservative then the Congress in any case
and could be argued to be particularly susceptible to changes in the attitudes
of voters.

Nevertheless, there could be economic causes of the change as

well, and these clearly need to be explored.

One such alternative hypothesis is suggested by the trend in the AFDC
csselosd, also shown in Figure 1.

The increase in the benefit in the early

1960s was followed shortly thereafter by en explosion in the AFDC caseload,
for the number of AFDC families per capita almost tripled over the six years
between 1966 and 1972.

Although the caseload has since leveled off, the

subsequent reduction in the benefit may simply have been a response to the

caseload increase.

As should be quite intuitive, and as will ha demonstrated

formally below, the caseload is effectively the price of the benefit;
consequently, the caseload explosion represented a 300 percent increase in the
price of AFOC benefits.1
This caseload increase suggests that the states oey have allowed reel
benefits to decline simply in order to keep reel AFDC expenditures by the
states constant, or at least growing in line with income.

However, the

benefit decline wee more than what was necessary to do so.

AFDC expenditures

leveled off in the late lg6Os and early 197Cc and then declined in absolute
terms after about 1g73, as should be clear from the caseload end benefit

A fortiori,

expenditures declined am a fraction of

state revenues (more on this momentarily).

Whether this should be expected or

not depends upon whether the price elasticity of the benefit does or does not
exceed one.
Another potential source of the benefit reduction ie the well—known
reduction in the growth rate of real income over the 197Cc.

As shown in

Figure 2, real income per capita in the U.S. grew during the 197Dm but at a
slower rate than in the 1960s and earlier.

Whether this income sloflown is

sufficiently large to explain the benefit decline is an empirical question, of
course, and will be examined below.

eut it is coneimtent with the growth

pattern of per capita state and local revenues, also shown in the figure,
which flattened out markedly in the 1970s.

Naturally, along with the

(and that there was

'fiscal distress', as it is called in

the

no long—term change in

literature, in that sector).

Nevertheless, despite this decline in growth of state and local expenditures,
expenditures on AFDC fell even more and even in absolute terms.

As a

consequence, AFDC expenditures fell as a share of total state and local
expenditures, as shown in Figure 3.

Thus the decline in the AFDC benefit

could not have been wholly a result of general revenue and expenditure
decline.
An additional hypothesis for the decline in the AFDC benefit is a
reduction in the generosity of federal matching for AFDO benefits.

t'tchng

rates for AFDC did indeed decline over the period but the reductions were
quite small in absolute terms——from a mean of 58 percent to one of 56 percent
for the regular AFDC matching rate and from 62 percent to 59 percent for the
Niedicaid

matching rate.

It will require a large price elasticity for these

reductions to generate the drastic decline in the AFDC benefit observed.
The alternative hypotheses to be examined in detail here are those
relating to the possible substitution of non—AFDC benefits for the AFDC
benefit.

The most prominent source of such effects is the possible

substitution of federally—financed Food stamp benefits for state—financed AFDC
benefits.

The Food Stamp program was introduced in the mid—1960s as an option

to the states and grew slowly until 1974, when congress mandated that all
states implement the program in all their counties.

Second, in most states Food Stamp certification of AFDC recipients

takes place physically in the AFOC offices themselves, providing strong
motivation for integration of the programs.

Third, the cash equivalent value

of Food Stamps is essentially the same as their market value, making it
unlikely that recipients would be worse off by having food transfers

percent of the AFDC amount.

Hence, an increase in the AFOC benefit of $1

would raise disposable income of the recipient by only 70 cents.

.s shown in

Table 1, the net sum of AFOC and Food Stamps in 1984 is only $505 per month,

only 5 percent higher than the value of AFDC alone in 1960.

This is a rather

small increase over the twenty—four years, given the much higher levels of
taxpayer income in 1984.

—

This

12 —

taxation also implies that a reduction in the state AFDC benefit by

one dollar would lower the net transfer to female—headed families in the state
by only 70 cents.

Thus an additional incentive for state legislatures to let

the real AFDC benefit decline is provided.

A second source of benefit substitution that may have occurred is the
substitution of Medicaid benefits for AFDC.

The Medicaid program was

introduced by the U.S. Congress in 1965 and grew rapidly over the late 1960s
and 1970s, at the same time that AFUC benefits were declining.

AFDC

recipients are categorically eligible for Medicaid benefits so that, even
though not all receive medical care in any given time interval, all are
essentially covered by health insurance and hence should be thought of as
receiving a transfer.

As in the AFDC program, state legislatures pay for

Medicaid expenditures but they are matched by the federal government at the
Medicaid matching rate referred to earlier.

Mowever, unlike AFDC, the basic

set of medical services provided to recipients is mandated by the federal
government.

Although states can supplement the basic set, and can even in

some circumstances put restrictions on the basic set (e.g.,

by limits on

hospital days), it is nevertheless the case that the core of Medicaid
expenditures are mandated by the federal government and hence are not under
the control of the states.
As Table

1

shows, the Medicaid benefit (i.e., its insurance value) grew

in the early 1970s and declined in the later 1970s.

The latter decline was

the result of sharp increases in medical care inflation and consequent
reductions in service delivery.

By 1984, the sum of AFDC, Food Stamps and

Medicaid was $785 per month, over 60 percent greater than the value of AFDC
alone in 1960.

Taking into acoount the taxation of AFDC by the Food Stamp

program, the net sum

—

the three benefits was $669 per month in 1984, 39

percent higher than the value of AFDC alone in 1960.

A further source of possible benefit substitution, also related to the
Medicaid program, is the substitution of non-

related benefits.

AFDC

recipients account

C Medicaid benefits

for AFDC—

for only 25 percent of Medicaid

expenditures, the other 75 percent consisting predominately of the aged and
the disabled.

The average Medicaid benefit for the aged is about double that

for AFDC families and that for the disabled is about triple that for AFDC
families.

The explosion in medical care prices in the 19705 led to tremendous

growth in non—AFDC Medicaid expenditures, particularly for nursing home
care.

As shown in Figure 4, non-AFUC Medicaid expenditures per capita grew

strongly all the way into the late 1970s, until medical care inflation once
more generated service reductions.

As concerns AFOC benefits, the simple

implication is that non-AFDC Medicaid expenditures may have crowded out AFDC
Medicaid expenditures and the AFDC benefit itself in the state budget; that
is,

the two may be substitutes in the state utility function.3
Plan of Analysis.

The goal of the analysis in the next few sections is

to test these substitution hypotheses against the data, and to determine
whether the other possible causes of benefit decline (caseload growth,
matching rates, real income growth slowdown) are sufficient by themselves,
either alone or in combination, to explain it.

The central difficulty in

testing the Food Stamp portion of the hypothesis, which is the primary one, is
that the Food Stamp benefit schedule is set by Congress and therefore does not
vary across the states.

Consequently, no cross—sectional correlation between

AFDC and Food Stamp benefits can be estimated.

—

As with Medel

a variation can be introduced to allow for rational

+ (1..43)P(F÷ M) — QPMJ

(16)

Finally, the influence of non—AFDC Medicaid expenditures can be
incorporated by modifying the utility function to allow a third argument
the aged
representing the transfer to non—AFOC Medicaid recipients, primarily
and disabled.

A separate argument is required because the marginal utility of

transfers fo the aged and disabled is likely to be quite different from that
of transfers to female heads of family.

As noted in the previous section,

Medicaid transfers to the aged and disabled are much greater than to female

of
heads, which could be interpreted as evidence that the marginal utility
transfers to the former are higher than to the latter.

15 —

In

past studies of the substitution hypothesis, this difficulty has been

circumvented in various ways.

Orr (1979) conducted a cross—sectional analysis

in the mid—19705 and regressed the AFDC benefit on the average Food Stamp
benefit actually paid in each state.

The Food Stamp benefit actually paid

differs across states because of differences in family size, non—welfare
income, and the amounts of various deductions in the benefit formula.4
However, legislatures are well aware of the difference between a guarantee set

in a benefit fornula——which holds family size, other income, etc. constant——
and an actual benefit paid out.

In setting the guarantee in the AFDC program,

state legislatures typically consider only the guarantee in the Food Stamp
program in their calculations.

In addition, econometrically speaking,

identifying the effect of Food Stamps by using variation in family size and
other variables requires the assumption that those variables do not affect
state AFDC actions directly, which is unlikely to be the case.

Moreover, the

variation in family size and other variables across states is not very large,
which could lead to unstable results.

A reanalysis of the Orr data by Hulten

et al. (1982) is consistent with this possibility, for Hulten et al. found the
Food Stamp coefficient in the Orr model to be quite sensitive to the inclusion
of additional state—specific variables.

Finally, regardless of the legitimacy

of family size and other such variables as instruments, the cross—sectional
variation in the Food Stamp benefit they induce is unlikely to have the same
effect on the AFDC benefit as will an upward shift in the entire Food Stamp
schedule, as has occurred over time.
plotnick and Winters (1985) (see also Plotnick (1986)) used cross—
sectional variation in the Food Stamp program in 1971 and 1972, when the
program was not in place in all counties.

The Food Stamp benefit was

—

multiplied

16 —

by the fraction of the counties in the state that had instituted

the program.

However, as discussed by Orr (1979), the states that adopted the

program first were the more liberal, high—benefit states; thus the PlotnickWinters variable runs the risk of some degree of endogeneity.

On the other

hand, Gramlich (1982) used time—series variation in the Food Stamp benefit
from 1974 to 1981 to estimate the substitution effect.5

Gramlich found his

results to be quite sensitive to the-specification assumed.
surprising for, as Table

above shows, the AFDC benefit fell from 1974 to

1981 and the Food Stamp benefit fluctuated with little or no pattern.

In

fact, given the long—standing decline of the AFDC benefit prior to 1974 and
its leveling off after 1981,

it is unlikely that the states were in

equilibrium over the 1974—1981 period.

To avoid these difficulties, this study takes a more direct approach to
the essentially time—series nature of the hypothesis

(i.e.,

why did AFDC

benefits decline over a specific calendar period?) by using cross—sectional

As a method of testing the weak version of the

substitution

hypothesis-—

namely, that there was some substitution though not necessarily on a dollarfor—dollar basis——the approach is rather weak, for it implies that any
significant difference between actual and forecasted AFDC benefits be taken as

a sign of substitution.

Obviously other factors could have been at work.

However, as a method of testing the strong version of the hypothesis--that the
substitution was actually one—for—one——the approach is correspondingly strong,
for it implies that the forecasted AFDC benefit should equal a precise dollar
amount.

The fact that cross—section regressions generally track time—series

variables rather poorly in most past applications strengthens the nature of
the test even more, especially when the drastic transformations of the welfare
system in the late 1960s and early 1970s are recognized.

ZCDELING THE EFFECT OF FOOD STAt2S
AND MEDICAID ON AFDC

Since most of the regressions to be estimated will be based upon only 48
observations, the models must be kept as simple as possible.

In the simplest,

the median voter of each state allocates his income between expenditure on the

AFDC benefit and on other goods, conditional upon a fixed Food Stamp benefit
provided by the federal government,

Unfortunately, the data do not contain

informstion rn the income or the tax price faced by the median voter, so the

mean voter must be used instead as an approximation.

Both years

can be reasonably argued to be equilibrium years, for in 1960 the AFDC system
had been stable in structure and in caseload growth for over a decade and in
1984 the AFDC benefit appears to have settled down after the transitional
years in the

lYlOs.

Thus cross—sectional regressions of

Such teats

will indirectly

determine the extent to which changes in the level of the caseload, matching
rates, and disposable income between the years are capable of explaining the
benefit decline.

A

backcast the 1960 benefit.

Such estimates obviously incorporate different

to be discussed

Real disposable income about doubled from 1960 to 1984.

Although standard errors are not shown, the data reveal that the addition of
Food Stamps has lowered the cross—stat variance in transfers but Medicaid has
raised it back to the same level as that of AFDC alone.
The nonlinearity of the matching rate schedule in 1960 requires modifying
the estimation procedure for the estimates in that year.3

In 1960 the

federal government matched state AFOC expenditures at a 83 percent rate at low
benefit levels, at a state—specific 'federal" matching rate at medium benefit
levels (the mean of which is shown in Table 2), and at zero rates for high
benefit levels.

As is well known from the analysis of piecewise—linear budget

sets (Hausman, 1985;

Moffitt, 1986), the demand equation along each segment in

1960 can be written in this case as

Although the most efficient method of

estimation of such models is maximum likelihood (see Moffitt, 1984, for an
application to grants—in—aid), the main analysis presented below will instead
use the instrumental variable technique of evaluating the schedule at the mean
benefit for all observations.

The mean benefit in 1960 was in the middle

segment of the schedule with matching rate shown in Table 2.

The implied

virtual price and income are therefore used in all 1960 regressions.

To test

the sensitivity of the results to this procedure, maximum likelihood piecewise
linear constraint (PLc) estimates are obtained as well on a subset of the
models.

MAIN R8SULTS

Table 3 shows the results of estimating the 1960 AFDC benefit
equations.

Column (1), the simplest model, shows a significant and positive

income effect and a negative, though insignificant, price effect.

At the

means of the data the coefficients imply price and income elasticities of -.17
and .98, respectively.

The near-unity income elasticity implies that the

share of income devoted to AFDC should stay approximately constant as income
increases.
Columns (2) and (3) show the effects of entering additional state
variables for region, urbanization, educational level of the population, and
other factors.

Region appears to be moderately important in explaining

benefits, with the South showing the lowest benefits, as expected, and the

West and Northeast showing the highest.

However, neither the urbanization

variables nor the variables added in column (3) are very significant, and an
F—test strongly rejects the significance of the incremental variables in that
column,

perhaps more important for present purposes, the inclusion of these

variables has no quantitatively important effect on the income coefficient but
it does reduce the magnitude of the price effects greatly and renders them
completely insignificant.

Thus the 1960 data provide weak evidence of price

effects at best.
Forecasts to 1984 are shown in Table 4 for Models I and II (Model III

All forecasts use the coefficients in column (1) in

The forecasted benefit in 1984 is 5645 per month, far above the

actual AFDC benefit of $344.

But this forecast is only $60 above the sum of

AFDC and Food Stamps in 1984, a very close forecast.

The forecast is

insignificantly different from the actual value, though this is partly a
result of a fairly high standard error of the prediction ($156).

The forecast

of the model under the assumption that voters recognize the taxation of AFDC
by the Food Stamp program (Model

IA(

is quite similar, overpredicting the net

benefit sum by approximately $55, again insignificantly different from zero.

When used to predict for models including Medicaid (Models II and hA), the
1960 regressions underpredict because the Medicaid benefit is about $180.

The

forecast error ranges from $125 to $130 but is again insignificantly different
from zero.
These 1960—based forecasts provide considerable support for the full
substitution hypothesis, for the forecasts are fairly close given the major
changes that occurred in the system between 1960 and 1984, and given the
fairly large absolute magnitude of the implied increase in the benefit sum
between the years.

Even for Model II, for example, the implied increase in

the benefit sum is $305 ($770 —

465),

and the 1960 regression predicts two—

thirds of that increase.
The estimates of Models I—Ill on the 1984 data are presented in

ffects of Federal Matching.

Given the primary result of the analysis——

that lump—sum federal transfers appear to generate dollar-for—dollar
determine whether
displacement by the states——it should be of interest to
traditional federal matching for AFDC may be an alternative mechanism to
increase transfers by the states.

As is well—known, the efficacy of matching

in general depends upon the magnitude of price elasticities

and,

relatedly, on

the degree to which federal grants are substituted into other areas of
expenditure by the states.

The fraction of the AFOC grant substituted into

other areas of expenditure is calculated as one minus the ratio of the
to the federal
stimulus (i.e., the effect of matching on the AFDC benefit)
grant.

In a prior analysis (Moffitt, 1984), it was found that almost 80 percent
that
of federal AFDC grants in 1970 were spent on non-AFDC purposes, implying
federal matching stimulates relatively little additional AFDC expenditure by

—

the

states.

38

—

A similar calculation here implies that out—substitution was 85

percent in 1960 but only 38 percent in 1984.17

The much lower out—

substitution effect in 1984 is a result of two factors,

First, the caseload

tripled between 1960 and 1984; therefore, a given federal matching rate has a

much greater stimulative effect on the AFOC benefit than it did previously.
Second, the mean federal grant has fallen because the mean benefit has fallen,
thereby again lowering the percent substituted out.

Thus it appears that,

currently; almost two—thirds of the federal AFDC grant is indeed used to
increase state AFDC expenditures, making this strategy
considerably rore
attractive than using Food Stamps to increase the total transfer.18

the Food Stamp program is closer to being a universal transfer program than

any other in the U.S.

However, the provision of federally—funded benefits to

husband-wife families, the same group covered by the AFDCU program, may, by a
similar logic to that discussed for the regular AFDC program, have discouraged
the adoption of AFDCU program in the states.

Since the AFDCU

selectivity bias problems would arise if caseload data were directly used.
Two proxy variables are employed instead:

caseload, and (2) the real weekly manufacturing wage in the state (most
workers in manufacturing are male), taken to be inversely related to the

The failure of the fraction of states adopting the program to grow past

industrial states, which also have high caseloads, column (3) reports the

SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS

study has examined the causes of the decline in real AFDC benefits

over the 1970s and 1980s and has focused on testing the hypothesis that states
have allowed Food Stamps and Medicaid to substitute for AFOC in the total
benefit package provided to female heads in the U.S.

The analysis is

conducted by forecasting benefits in the 1980a from cross—section regressions

in the 1960s, backcasting benefits in the 19605 from cross—section regressions
in the 1980s, and pooling data from both periods to test directly for
structural change.

The results support the strong version of the substitution

hypothesis, that for which substitution occurs on a dollar—for—dollar bests.
The evidence is stronger in support of the hypothesis that both Food Stamps
and Medicaid have substituted for AFDC than that Food Stamps alone has done

suggest that the Food Stamp

pr

Additional results

ram has also slowed the adoption of the AFDCU

program.
There are several implications of the findings of the paper.

First, the

basic result that the transfer package has increased over time in line with
the growth of income suggests that the benefit will continue to grow in the
future, at least to the extent that income growth also maintains its past
pattern.

Thus thers is no reason in these results to expect any decline in

redistribution.

Second, the results imply that lump—sum transfer programs enacted by
Congress have no effect on the total transfer, and therefore on the net
incomes, of low—income female heads.
transfers with in—kind transfers.

Instead, they merely displace cash

As a matter of perhaps naive political

speculation, one may wonder why Congress has enacted such a programF the
answer may be that there are stronger political lobbies (agriculture,
hospitals) behind in-kind transfers than behind cash transfers.

Be that as it

to
may, the implication is that Congress simply does not have the ability
increase transfers, at least not in this fashion.

Instead, it can only

provide a large measure of budget relief to the states.
There are, of course, other policies available to Congress should it
truly wish to increase the level of transfers.

As discussed in the paper,

use of matching rates would provide nontrivial price incentives, at
on average. Alternatively, federalization of the AFDC program would

heavier

directly

eliminate the ability of states to counter federal transfer policy,

or the establishment of a minimum benefit would constrain that ability.
for future
Optimal federal policy under these conditions should be a topic
research.
