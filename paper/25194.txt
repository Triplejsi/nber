ABSTRACT
We study green bonds, which are bonds whose proceeds are used for environmentally sensitive
purposes. After an overview of the U.S. corporate and municipal green bonds markets, we study
pricing and ownership patterns using a simple framework that incorporates assets with
nonpecuniary utility. As predicted, we find that green municipal bonds are issued at a premium to
otherwise similar ordinary bonds. We also confirm that green bonds, particularly small or
essentially riskless ones, are more closely held than ordinary bonds. These pricing and ownership
effects are strongest for bonds that are externally certified as green.

Introduction
Climate change is accelerating. Since recordkeeping began in 1880, the six warmest years

on record for the planet have all occurred since 2010. 1 The rising temperature and increasing
acidity of ocean water, climbing sea levels and the retreat of ice sheets and glaciers, and the
increasing frequency of droughts and floods all reflect a changing climate and increasing
atmospheric carbon levels. 2 One estimate suggests that keeping the world below the 2 degree
Celsius scenario, a threshold viewed as limiting the likelihood of devastating consequences, will
require $12 trillion over the next 25 years (Bloomberg New Energy Finance, 2015), but simply
adapting to existing conditions or foreseeable changes will also require enormous sums.
In the absence of a global carbon pricing scheme, bond markets will be central to
financing these interventions. In this paper, we study the U.S. market for “green bonds,” which
we and others define as bonds whose proceeds are used for an environmentally friendly purpose.
Examples include renewable energy, clean transportation, sustainable agriculture and forestry,
energy efficiency, and biodiversity conservation. After reviewing the market and green bond
characteristics, we set out and test predictions for pricing and ownership patterns. The stark facts
of climate change alone are enough to motivate study of green bonds, but our framework and
results also tie to broader themes in the socially responsible investing and taste-based asset
pricing literatures.
Since the first green bond was issued in 2007 by the European Investment Bank (EIB),
the market has expanded to include a variety of issuers, including supranationals, sovereigns,
corporations, and U.S. and international municipalities. It is a small but increasingly well-defined
area of the fixed income markets. Yet in spite of the general acceptance of the notion of a

“green” bond, there is not yet a single universally-recognized system for determining the green
status of a bond. Green bonds may be labeled and promoted as such by the issuer, such as the
2007 EIB issue; formally certified by a third party according to a set of guidelines; or, labeled
green by a data provider, for example Bloomberg. We review the origins of the market and
standards for identifying green bonds in the next section.
Our sample includes 2,083 green U.S. municipal bonds issued between 2010 and 2016
and 19 green U.S. corporate bonds issued between 2014 and 2016. Municipal bonds, at the cusip
level, are typically far smaller than corporates; the total par outstanding for municipal green
bonds and corporate green bonds is actually about the same as of the end of 2016, around $12
billion. In 2016, about 2% of new municipal bonds were green, while only about 0.3% of
corporate bonds were green. On average, green municipals have higher credit ratings and longer
maturities than ordinary municipals. They are more likely to be taxable, especially early in the
sample, and are somewhat larger. Green corporate bonds resemble ordinary corporates.
Our analysis of pricing and ownership patterns is organized by a framework featuring a
subset of investors with a nonpecuniary component of utility, such as a sense of social
responsibility from holding green bonds, in addition to standard portfolio mean and variance. In
this framework, expected returns include the usual CAPM beta term plus a second term,
reflecting demand for a security’s environmental attributes, which illustrates that securities with
higher scores—such as green bonds—are priced at a premium and earn lower returns. The basic
prediction is similar to those from the general equilibrium model of Henkel, Kraus, and Zechner
(2001) and the taste-based framework of Fama and French (2007).
We confirm that green municipal bonds are indeed priced at a premium. After-tax yields
at issue for green bonds versus ordinary bonds are roughly 6 basis points below yields paid by

2

otherwise equivalent bonds. Depending on specification, the estimates control for ratings,
maturity, the yield curve, tax status, other time-varying characteristics, other bond-specific
characteristics, ratings-maturity-yield curve interactions, and even issuer fixed effects. On a bond
with a 10-year duration, a yield difference of 6 basis points corresponds to a plausible and
economically meaningful 0.60 percentage-point difference in value. Interestingly, this premium
doubles or triples for bonds that are not only self-labeled as green (and confirmed by Bloomberg)
but also externally certified as green by a third party, according to industry guidelines, and
publicly registered with the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI).
Our framework also makes predictions for ownership concentration of green bonds.
Green bonds should be held disproportionately by concerned investors, who must be willing to
accept their equilibrium lower returns. This concentration will be particularly strong for small
bonds, where tilting away from market weights is less consequential, and when the bond is
almost riskless, since risk aversion limits the extent to which concerned investors are willing to
pursue a nonpecuniary benefit. Using institutional bond ownership data, we find supportive
evidence for these predictions. The Herfindahl-Hirschman index is indeed higher for green
bonds, especially relatively small bonds and those rated AAA. Also, echoing the pricing effect,
concentration is particularly elevated for CBI certified green bonds.
There is a small amount of other recent work on green bonds. There are many issuer
types one might study—supranationals, sovereigns, municipals, agencies, corporates, and
others—and each differs in its target investor base, currency risks, and trading and institutional
environment. So far, pricing results have been mixed. Using secondary market prices, a green vs.
ordinary bond matching procedure, and a sample that includes 135 large, investment grade green
bonds of many categories and currencies, Zerbib (2017) finds a moderate green bond premium in

3

some subcategories. Karpf and Mandel (2017) use secondary market yields in a larger sample of
municipals. Quite in contrast to our own results, they find a green bond discount. Our sample is
broader and our methodology is different, but to the extent they overlap, our results suggest this
conclusion may be incorrect. Pricing in the U.S. municipals market is highly sensitive to tax
features, as shown by Atwood (2003). Many green municipal bonds in the first half of the sample
are taxable, so they were issued and naturally traded at higher yields. In after-tax terms, however,
they actually sold for a premium, i.e. lower yield. 3
Although green bonds are a new setting, the analysis fits into an existing literature on
socially responsible investing. Renneboog, Ter Horst, and Zhang (2008) survey the literature and
conclude that that a subset of investors is willing to accept lower financial performance to invest
in funds that meet social objectives. Martin and Moser (2015) confirm this in an experiment,
while Riedl and Smeets (2015) provide further corroboration using administrative and survey
data from a sample of Dutch investors in mutual funds that have Socially Responsible
Investment (SRI) mandates. Białkowski and Starks (2016) examine U.S. equity mutual funds
with SRI mandates and conclude that inflows to those funds have been higher than inflows to
comparable funds without similar mandates and that SRI flows are less sensitive to performance.
Barber, Morse, and Yasuda (2017) analyze the flows of limited partner investments across
venture capital funds and reach a similar conclusion.
Experiments also suggest that some consumers integrate environmental benefits or
positive social impact into their behavior. For example, Hainmueller, Hiscox, and Sequeira
(2015) found that demand for the two most popular coffees in a U.S. grocery store chain rose by
3

The available practitioner research is also somewhat mixed. Shurey (2017) finds a green bond premium in a
sample of 12 supranational, euro-denominated green bonds, but reports that “similar yield curves for other
portfolios, including U.S. dollar denominated and corporate-issued green bonds do not consistently demonstrate a
premium for green securities” (p. 2). Ehlers and Packer (2017) review green bond certification schemes and find a
green bond premium at issuance in a sample of 21 green bonds collected across issuer and currency categories.

4

almost 10% when they carried a Fair Trade label versus a generic placebo label. Demand for the
higher-priced coffee remained steady when its price was raised, but demand for the lower-priced
coffee was highly elastic. Behavior might be very different in capital markets, of course. For
instance, institutional investors are fiduciaries to the beneficiary while consumers act on their
own behalf. In addition, consumption decisions might invoke identity and emotional responses
that might not exist as strongly in investment decisions. Green bonds provide a novel setting to
examine how capital markets treat environmental benefits.
Another body of related work has examined the stock returns of companies that have
potentially negative social effects, such as those that produce alcohol, tobacco, or firearms, or
that manage prisons or casinos. Hong and Kacperzyk (2009) suggests that “sin stocks” trade at a
discount and display higher average returns. Statman and Glushkov (2009) use a broader
definition of sin stocks and a different time period and come to the opposite conclusion. Bansal,
Wu, and Yaron (2017) suggest that a time-varying investor taste for socially responsible stocks
may help reconcile these contradictory conclusions.
In brief, our contributions relative to this prior work are to provide: an academic
introduction to the U.S. market for green bonds; a consistent framework to study both pricing
and ownership patterns; a consistent set of empirical results in a comprehensive sample; and,
evidence that certification is important in this emerging market. Nonetheless, the green bond
market is just a first step toward addressing enormous problems. There is a commensurate need
for additional research on green bonds and other areas of climate finance.
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the green
bond market and the characteristics of green bonds versus ordinary bonds. Section 3 uses a
simple model to develop the prediction that green bonds should price at a premium, then tests

5

and confirms that prediction. Section 4 extends the framework to predict that green bonds should
be held in greater concentration, then confirms that prediction and some finer ones. Section 5
concludes.

An Overview of U.S. Green Bonds

2.1.

Historical Origins
The green bond market has international origins and embraces many bond issuer types.

The first bond labeled as a “green bond” was issued in 2007 by the European Investment Bank.
Other supranational issuers include the International Finance Corporation arm of the World
Bank, which in 2013 issued the first $1 billion green bond. A benchmark example of a modern
sovereign green bond is France’s $10 billion bond, issued in 2017.
Corporate and sub-sovereign issuance of green bonds has also grown rapidly. The first
corporate green bonds were issued by the French utility EDF, the Swedish property development
company Vasakronan, and Bank of America. The first U.S. municipal bond to use the green
bond label in its offering documents (that is, to self-label), as opposed to having acquired the
label by market convention, was issued by Massachusetts in 2013. However, municipal bonds
issued as early as 2010 under the federal Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (CREB) and Qualified
Energy Conservation Bond (QECB) programs are considered labeled green bonds by market
convention. These represent most of the early green bonds in our sample. 4
The first sub-sovereign issuer outside of the U.S. was Gothenburg, Sweden, which issued
SEK 500 million par value in 2013. 5 Other recent international issuers include the Province of

Both programs were eliminated effective January 1, 2018 by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which repeals tax credit
bonds.

Ontario and Johannesburg, South Africa. Fannie Mae has pioneered green mortgage-backed
securities, which pool mortgages made to finance environment-related investments.
The emergence of the green bond market occurred alongside the development of other
services for issuers, regulators, and investors. In 2014, a consortium of investment banks
established voluntary guidelines for the green bonds market. These “Green Bond Principles” are
organized around four elements: the use of proceeds of the bond issue; the process for evaluating
projects; the management of the proceeds; and, reporting and disclosure regarding the proceeds
and the project financed. 6 Third-party agents offer certification services for potentially green
bonds, and the Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s ratings agencies have also developed criteria and
indexes for this market. The introduction of green bond ETFs is a further indicator of the
maturation of the market.
2.2.

Identifying Green Bonds
What is a “green bond”? The category is not as strictly defined as “S&P 500 stocks” but

not as fuzzy as “junk bonds” or “growth stocks.” We use the Bloomberg green bond tag for our
sample of U.S. corporate and municipal bonds as an objective, replicable identification method
that meets institutional standards. To avoid the difficulties of comparing bonds across disparate
institutional environments, we do not include supranationals or international corporate or
government issues.
Bloomberg describes the task as follows: “There are many shades of green … In addition,
terminology often varies, with issuers using different titles to promote the environmental benefits
of their bonds. While the use of proceeds often varies by bond as well, all issuers must commit to
deploying 100% of bond proceeds for environmental sustainability-oriented activities in order

7

for their bond to be identified as a labeled green bond” (Shurey 2016, p. 3). Bloomberg’s process
is based loosely on the Green Bond Principles described above.
Specifically, Bloomberg takes into account issuer self-labeling as “green” and/or
additional statements in the issuance documentation about the issuer’s intention to deploy funds
toward environmentally friendly projects. Acceptable uses of funds include renewable energy,
energy smart technologies, green infrastructure, clean transportation, sustainable water
management, sustainable agriculture and forestry, pollution control, biodiversity conservation,
climate change adaptation, and eco-efficient products. CREB and QECB bonds are considered
green bonds by Bloomberg and market convention and represent most of the early green bonds
in the sample.
There are currently only a few U.S. corporate green bonds, which is unsurprising given
the requirement to isolate and designate proceeds exclusively for projects with the uses listed
above. Several corporates do satisfy Bloomberg’s requirements, however, and, occasionally,
Bloomberg will tag a corporate bond as green, even if it is described as for general corporate
purposes, if the issuer is a pure play in that “all the company’s business activities fit solely within
the list of accepted green activities” (p. 8).
A subset of labeled green bonds are certified by third parties as conforming to some
green bond standard. An interesting question is whether certification, which is intended to
highlight the bond to investors as a green bond but comes at a cost, is associated with pricing or
ownership patterns above and beyond those associated with the general Bloomberg green bond
flag. 7 Such effects could arise because the issuer engages the third-party verifier in the preissuance phase (there would be little benefit to the issuer to pay to certify the bond as green after
it is floated); certification at this phase thereby enables the issuer and underwriters to market the

8

bond as certified in their roadshow. To provide ex post reconciliation, after the bond issuance
and the allocation of proceeds, the verifier must confirm that the bond aligns with the postissuance requirements of, for example, the Climate Bond Standard. 8
2.3.

Sample, Market Size, and Growth
Using the Bloomberg identifications of green bonds, we gather initial yields and other

characteristics data for corporates from Bloomberg and for municipals from Mergent (which is
more comprehensive for municipal bonds). The Mergent data are from the Official Statements
filed with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board in the context of bond issuances. MSRB
regulations require that filing with each municipal bond issue. We exclude floating rate bonds,
which in any event are rarely green.
The unit of observation is the individual bond, as identified by a separate CUSIP
number. Municipal bonds are typically sold in issues that consist of multiple bonds; an issue is a
set of bonds that are sold at the same time and are generally subject to the same bond indenture
but may include both green and ordinary bonds across a range of maturities.
As the top panel of Table 1 indicates, our total municipal bond sample, which runs from
2010 through 2016, contains 2,083 green bonds, versus 643,299 ordinary bonds. There are 204
unique issuer-year observations. The green bond sample begins in 2010 with the introduction of
the CREB and QECB programs. As a percentage of ordinary bond issuance dollar volume, green
bonds increased by a factor of ten over the sample period, from 0.18% of ordinary issuance in
2010 to 1.9% of ordinary issuance in 2016. Hence, green bonds are a still-modest but rapidly
expanding segment of the municipal market. It is worth noting that the green municipal bond
market has been growing even though the CREB and QECB programs, which presented special
incentives for issuers, have now phased out.
8

For more details on the process, see: https://www.climatebonds.net/standards/certification/get-certified.

9

The corporate bond sample begins in 2014 and contains only 19 green bonds, with 13
unique issuer-year observations. In 2016, they represented 0.31% of total corporate dollar
volume. Green corporate bonds therefore remain a very small component of the U.S. corporate
bond market. As mentioned above, this is not surprising in light of the difficulty of ring-fencing
corporate proceeds and reporting in the presence of unclear benefits.
2.4.

Uses of Green Bonds
Green bonds are defined by their environmentally-friendly uses. Table 2 shows the

breakdown of uses by Mergent for green municipals. It also shows our own characterization of
uses for green corporates based on offering documents and other sources. The most popular uses
for municipal green bonds proceeds include public power, mass transit, education (e.g., energyefficient school buildings and dormitories), and water and sewer projects. In no category are
green bonds a large fraction of municipal issuance between 2010 and 2016, however. The table
suggests that numerous municipal bonds which are not labeled green by Bloomberg, because
they were not self-labeled as such by the issuer, could be labeled green. Put differently, the study
of green bonds is as much a study of the effect of the green label as a study of bonds with
fundamentally new uses of proceeds.
For example, intrinsically environmentally-sensitive uses such as pollution control and
mass transit are overwhelmingly financed by ordinary bonds. This in turn suggests that the U.S.
green bond “market” could enlarge dramatically just by broader use of the label, but in terms of
financing climate change solutions this is significant only to the extent that there are unique
patterns in ownership or pricing associated with the label (which we document later) or has real
effects in terms of financing projects that could or would not have been financed by ordinary
bonds. Indeed, the Climate Bond Initiative (CBI) was set up with a focus on this broader

10

“climate aligned” bond market, which dwarfs the labeled green bond market. The majority of the
climate aligned bonds were financing low carbon transportation solutions such as railways. The
pricing of all climate aligned bonds, as opposed to explicitly labeled green bonds, is a natural
topic for future research.
2.5.

Bond Characteristics
Table 3 presents bond-level summary statistics. Panel A begins with the municipal

sample. We use the first rating available in Mergent, regardless of whether it is from Standard
and Poor’s, Moodys, or Fitch. When required, we translate the other agencies’ ratings to the S&P
scale and then to an ordinal numerical scale, with “1” assigned to the top rating of AAA, “2” to
the next highest rating of “AA+”, and so forth. BBB-, the lowest S&P rating considered
investment grade, is a “10” on this scale. Green municipal bonds carry higher credit ratings than
the ordinary bonds, with a median of AA+. The median rating of the ordinary bonds is AA. The
modal green bond carries an essentially riskless AAA rating.
Green municipal bonds also have longer maturities. The difference between the mean
maturities is 1.25 years. Green bonds are less likely to be identified by Mergent as being sold
with third-party insurance or other credit guarantees. Driven by the CREB and QECB green
bonds from the first few years in the sample, green bonds are much more likely to be federally
taxable, which is crucial to incorporate into their pricing at issue. Green bonds are slightly less
likely to be subject to state tax and their coupons are never subject to the Alternative Minimum
Tax, unlike some private-activity bonds issued to fund stadiums, hospitals, or similar projects.
Green bonds are larger and, on average, part of larger bond issues than ordinary bonds, a
fact that may owe something to the fixed costs of green status. They are significantly less likely
to be bank-eligible, a category of bonds where commercial banks are allowed to deduct 80

11

percent of the interest cost incurred in order to own the bond. These bonds are legally required to
be small and have other restrictions that may be difficult to square with green status.
Green bonds are much more likely to be new money bonds as opposed to being used to
refund existing bonds. They are much less likely—14.7 percent versus 46.8 percent for ordinary
bonds—to be general obligation bonds, meaning that their security consists of a claim on the
issuer’s tax revenue and not merely to the revenue generated by a specific project. To repeat,
whether a bond is labeled green is based on its use of proceeds, not its backing.
Finally, 11.7% of green municipal bonds in our sample are certified by a third party, most
often Sustainalytics, as confirming to some standard. Just over half of these, or 6.6% of the total
green bond sample, are further registered with the Climate Bonds Initiative as conforming to the
Green Bond Principles. We refer to such bonds as “CBI certified.” Anecdotal evidence suggests
that this further affirmation is an important distinction, recognized by institutional investors, so
we look at CBI certified bonds closely. Certification is a recent but growing practice. The first
green bonds in our sample that were certified by any third party were issued at the end of 2014,
and all of the certified bonds registered with the CBI were issued in 2016.
Corporate bond-level statistics are presented in Panel B. Credit ratings of green corporate
bonds do not differ significantly from those of ordinary bonds. Green corporates exhibit slightly
lower maturity and larger size but are, in the main, similar to ordinary corporate bonds.

3.

Pricing Green Bonds

3.1.

Asset Prices with a Nonpecuniary Clientele
We start with a relatively standard asset pricing framework to understand how a clientele

for green bonds (or, generically, a non-financial objective) affects prices and portfolio choice.

12

The model reproduces the asset pricing effect in Henkel, Kraus, and Zechner (2001) and
Fama and French (2007), among others. Henkel et al. develop a general equilibrium model
where firms and investors are jointly optimizing; we reach the same prediction for equilibrium
returns (equivalently, the costs of capital) in a simpler setting. Our treatment is closer to Fama
and French, who examine the effect of investor biases and tastes on asset prices, also taking firm
behavior as exogenous. A leading example of “tastes” in their model is socially responsible
investing. Neither paper investigates ownership concentration, as we do later herein. Also, both
of these papers use calibrations to examine the potential impact of tastes on asset prices, as well
as corporate behavior in the case of Henkel et al., and compare these calibrations to moments in
the data. We take predictions to the municipal green bond market, directly examining pricing and
ownership patterns.
There are two groups of investors, each facing a one-period portfolio choice problem.
Both groups have a common risk aversion parameter γ and common expectations for security
returns r and risk Σ. They choose a vector of portfolio weights w in each security. Group 1
investors are mean-variance maximizers while Group 2 investors also care about environmental
ratings (or another nonpecuniary attribute). That is, some securities have positive environmental
scores e > 0, and Group 2 investors obtain extra utility from holding them. Without loss of
generality we assume the overall average e is zero. Specifically, the two groups solve:
𝛾𝛾

Group 1: max 𝐰𝐰1′ 𝐫𝐫 − 2 𝐰𝐰1′ 𝚺𝚺𝐰𝐰1
𝛾𝛾

Group 2: max 𝐰𝐰2′ 𝐫𝐫 + 𝐰𝐰2′ 𝐞𝐞 − 2 𝐰𝐰2′ 𝚺𝚺𝐰𝐰2

Note that Group 2’s objective function resembles how ESG mandates are implemented in
practice. In particular, if Group 2 investors require that their portfolios maintain a minimal
average environmental score, this is equivalent to imposing a linear constraint of the form 𝐰𝐰2′ 𝐞𝐞 ≥
13

𝑘𝑘 and leads to the same maximization problem as above. Also, this formulation accommodates
not only so-called positive screening, where extra utility is gained by holding (for example)

green bonds, but also negative screening, where extra utility is lost by holding (for example)
fossil fuel or sin stocks, by appropriately flipping signs and redefining e. 9
The two groups have capital of a1 and a2, respectively, and the market clears. Because we
are also interested in ownership concentration in a following section, we stipulate that Group 1’s
capital comes from a1 individuals each with $1, and likewise Group 2’s capital comes from a2
individuals each with $1. We express this as:
𝑎𝑎1
𝑎𝑎2
𝐰𝐰1 +
𝐰𝐰 = 𝐰𝐰𝑚𝑚
𝑎𝑎1 + 𝑎𝑎2
𝑎𝑎1 + 𝑎𝑎2 2

where wm is the market portfolio, a vector of weights in each security equal to its market values
as a fraction of the total market value of all securities.
We start with the uninteresting case where a2 is equal to zero, so that there are only
Group 1 investors, which have no environmental preference. They choose weights, given
common return and risk expectations, and these representative investor weights must equal
market weights for the market to clear:
𝐰𝐰1 =

1 −1
𝚺𝚺 𝐫𝐫 = 𝐰𝐰𝑚𝑚
𝛾𝛾

We can use this equation to compute the expected return of the market as a whole, which allows
us to substitute the market Sharpe ratio for the inverse of risk aversion γ, leading to the familiar
Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) formula:
𝐫𝐫 =

𝑟𝑟𝑚𝑚
𝚺𝚺𝚺𝚺𝑚𝑚 = 𝛃𝛃𝑟𝑟𝑚𝑚
2
𝜎𝜎𝑚𝑚

9

In the case of e measured by a green bond indicator, the e > 0 designation is at the extreme because the score is
binary and green bonds are comparatively rare. This means that a z-scored green flag will contain many small
negative scores and relatively few very positive ones in order to preserve zero mean and unit standard deviation.

14

Now, we add Group 2 investors, who have an environmental preference, to the mix. Their
portfolio weights are simply
𝐰𝐰2 =

1 −1
𝚺𝚺 (𝐫𝐫 + 𝐞𝐞)
𝛾𝛾

Since the average environmental score is mean zero, we can make the same substitution for γ
using market clearing. The CAPM then holds up to a small twist:
𝐫𝐫 =

𝑟𝑟𝑚𝑚
𝑎𝑎2
𝚺𝚺𝚺𝚺
=
𝛃𝛃𝑟𝑟
−
𝐞𝐞
𝑚𝑚
𝑚𝑚
2
𝜎𝜎𝑚𝑚
𝑎𝑎1 + 𝑎𝑎2

Prediction 1: Securities with positive environmental scores (such as green bonds) have lower
expected returns.

When some investors have an additional nonpecuniary preference for a security, they bid up its
price. We test this prediction next.
3.2.

Yield Data
The green bond market is young and there have been few, if any, defaults. To detect

differences in expected returns, we focus on yields at issue. Due to the very small number of
U.S. corporate green bonds we concentrate on municipal bonds for the rest of our analysis.
Like ordinary municipal bonds, green municipal bonds are generally tax exempt. As
mentioned earlier, green bonds issued under the CREB and QECB programs were taxable,
however. We therefore concentrate on the after-tax yield at issue to allow yields on green and
ordinary bonds to be judged on the yardstick most relevant to the tax-sensitive investors who
influence the municipal bond market.

15

We combine data from multiple sources to compute after-tax yields. Data on the tax
status of the bonds come from Mergent and are based on the issues’ official statements. These
data identify both the federal and the state tax status of each bond. Bonds are identified as being
taxable, tax-exempt, or subject to Alternative Minimum Tax at the federal level. Bonds are also
identified as being taxable or not at the state level.
Federal tax rates come from the Tax Policy Center. 10 The marginal tax rate used is the tax
rate prevailing at the highest income levels in that year. Post-2013 tax rates include the 3.8%
ACA surcharge in addition to the 39.6% top marginal income tax rate applicable through 2016.
State tax rates come from the Taxsim model of the National Bureau of Economic Research. 11 For
each state the rate used is also the rate applicable to top income levels.
We then calculate a pre-tax and after-tax yield as the internal rate of return on each
bond’s cash flows before and after taxation, respectively. We assume that the bond’s relevant tax
rate is the rate at the time of issuance and that the bond is held by a top-income resident of the
state from which the bond is issued. In cases where our calculated pre-tax yield differs from the
yield reported by Mergent, we reset the after-tax yield to the Mergent yield from the official
statements minus the difference between our calculated pre-tax and after-tax yields.
Table 4 shows average yields by year for green and ordinary bonds. The need to carefully
account for tax features is apparent for the 2010-2013 green bonds sample, which is dominated
by taxable CREB and QECB bonds. 12 Overall average after-tax yields are somewhat lower for
green bonds than ordinary bonds, at 2.28% versus 2.50%. We have seen that green bonds and
ordinary municipal bonds can be different with respect to certain characteristics that are likely to

Karpf and Mandel (2017) found that green bonds had higher yields at issue but did not adjust for the fact that
early green bonds were disproportionately taxable.

correlate with their yields, of course, and coincidental movements in the credit curve can upset
the impression from simple averages.
3.3.

Yield Regressions
To more properly test the prediction that green bonds sell for a premium, we regress

after-tax yields on green bond indicators and controls in Table 5. In all specifications, we control
for maturity, rating, and month fixed effects. We also include size decile categories both for the
size of the bond cusip itself and for the total value of all bonds brought by that issuer on that day,
the presence of insurance, tax features (effectively as a precaution, since we are already directly
measuring after-tax issue yield), bank qualification status, new money, general obligation
collateralization, and use of proceeds. In some specifications we use maturityXratingXmonth
interaction fixed effects, thus taking account of twists in the credit curve, and even issuer fixed
effects. These controls account for most of the variation in yields. 13
All specifications support the prediction that green bonds sell for a moderate premium.
Holding characteristics and the state of the yield and credit curves equal, green bonds are issued
at after-tax yields around five to seven basis points lower than those of ordinary bonds. To put
this in extremely crude perspective, consider that the average after-tax yield for AAA ordinary
bonds is 2.31% (unreported). The average after-tax yield for an ordinary bond rated BBB-, which
is the lowest investment grade rating and nine notches lower than AAA, is 3.27% (unreported).
This works out to about a 12 basis point increase for every ratings notch. A green bond
coefficient on the order of six basis points thus implies that green bonds are priced as if they
were “half a notch” more highly rated.

13

The inclusion of maturityXratingXmonth interactions generates approximately 18,000 fixed effects. The inclusion
of issuer fixed effects generates approximately 21,000 fixed effects.

17

Of course, greenness is not assigned to a bond at random, so the extent of causality
cannot be pinpointed. Our perspective is that given that the regressions control for use of
proceeds, maturityXratingXmonth interaction fixed effects, collateral type, and even issuer fixed
effects, it is a stretch to attribute the full coefficient to some systematic difference in the risk of
green versus ordinary bonds that has been perceived and priced by muni investors since market
inception but remains unmeasurable and unrecognized by ratings agencies.
Interestingly, bonds that are CBI certified green are priced at an even greater premium.
These are a subset of the Bloomberg green bonds, so the total premium for CBI certified over
ordinary bonds is the sum of the two coefficients in Table 5. In the first specification, CBI
certified green bonds have yields 26 basis points lower than ordinary bonds with similar
characteristics and timing. In the context of low-risk municipal bonds issued in a historically low
interest-rate environment, this is a sizeable difference, since 26 basis points is equivalent to the
reduction in yield that comes from climbing two ratings notches. Even with issuer fixed effects
and many other controls and interactions, the average difference between the after-tax issue yield
on CBI certified green bonds and ordinary bonds amounts to 15 basis points per year.
We conduct some additional exercises and robustness tests in Table 6. In all
specifications, we include the fullest set of fixed effects, including maturityXratingXmonth
interactions, issuer effects, uses of proceeds effects, and other collected flags, as in the last
column of Table 5.
The first two columns aim to address any potential differences between the early green
bonds, largely associated with the CREB and QECB federal programs, and more recent bonds.
The first column switches to pretax yields as a dependent variable. The premium on green bonds
remains, but is smaller in pretax terms, while the coefficient on CBI certification increases in

18

size and significance relative to its after-tax yield coefficient. The second column breaks the
green bond effects into early green bonds and more recent ones, and finds similar if not slightly
larger effects in the more recent subsample. These exercises indicate that any differences in the
technical aspects of the early green bonds are not associated with offering price differences.
The third column investigates whether any third-party certification of the greenness of a
bond, as opposed to the dual layer of third-party certification and registration with the CBI that is
fairly widely recognized by institutional investors, is also associated with offering yields. In
unreported results, we find that the coefficient on “Any Certification” is strongly significant
when “CBI Certification” is excluded. When both certification variables are included, however,
the picture muddies. Overall, the combination of third-party certification and registration with
the CBI appears is associated with the largest and most robust certification-related pricing
difference.
The last regression investigates any crossover pricing effects in the circumstance that
green bonds are issued not in isolation but simultaneously with ordinary bonds on the same issue
date. If investors have allocated a sum toward an issuer-date with given risk and maturity
characteristics, for instance, they may view the green bonds as preferable on the margin (e.g.,
they satisfy a mandate that ordinary bonds of identical risk do not), leading the ordinary bonds to
a worse price than if they were issued separately. The coefficient on “Both Types Issued Today”
measures the extra yield on an ordinary bond in this situation, while the sum of this coefficient
plus that of the interaction of the Both Types variable with the green indicator measures the extra
yield that appears on a green bond. (Note that the regression already controls for the individual
bond size and the total size of all bonds, green and ordinary, issued on that day.) All else equal,
when the two types are issued together, the green bond’s after-tax yield is higher by about a basis

19

point—that is, the usual green premium shrinks by a small amount—while the ordinary bond’s
after-tax yield is higher by a more meaningful four basis points. A tentative conclusion from this
is that issuers may want to issue green bonds separately to avoid siphoning off demand from
their ordinary bonds.
3.5.

Is Certification Worth It?
Like the green bond label itself, green bond certification by third parties is not randomly

assigned—municipalities must pay for it—so it is unclear how much of the incremental
reduction in yield associated with CBI certification is causal. If bonds that are CBI certified were
already recognized by investors and priced as “especially green,” for example, the coefficient
will overstate the effect of certification. On the other hand, a fundamental reason green bond
issuers pay for third-party certification is that they fear that the bond would not otherwise attract
the full attention of concerned investors. From that perspective, the coefficient on CBI
certification might understate the price that investors will pay for an indisputably green bond.
A back of the envelope calculation sheds some light on the benefits and costs of
certification. There are five CBI-certified municipal issues in our sample. These comprise 137
individual bonds. The median total issue size, corresponding to the 22-bond issue by San
Francisco Public Utilities in December 2016, is $259 million. As an upper bound, if the full
amount of the coefficients in Table 5 were taken as causal, a reduction of ten basis points per
year would imply a savings of $259,000 per year. Even a tiny amount of causality, however,
consisting of a single basis point, would still save the municipality $25,900 per year, which has a
nontrivial present value. In the context of a larger issuer which brings numerous bonds to market
every year, CBI certification may offer a potentially meaningful cost reduction.

20

Against this pricing benefit falls two categories of costs. Internal processes to allocate
and confirm the management of proceeds might involve some costs, but we have no evidence on
their magnitude. We have more evidence on external costs related to parties contracted for the
certification. The main certification fee is to be paid once and immediately after the issuance of
the bond. The cost of the third party certifier/verifier—in our sample, usually Sustainalytics, but
it can also be a Big 4 firm, environmental consultancy, or environmental NGO—is negotiable;
anecdotal evidence suggests that it falls between $10,000 and $50,000 depending on issuance
size. 14 If the issuer chooses, it can engage a certifier for ongoing evaluations. Registration of the
bond with the Climate Bonds Standard Board requires a further fee equal to one-tenth of a basis
point of the bond principal. All together, the present value of the external costs of certifying an
issue appear to be well under $100,000 and most likely a fraction of that. Comparing these costs
to the potential pricing benefits suggests that CBI certification could be a good deal for larger
and/or longer-maturity bonds.

Ownership Concentration of Green Bonds

4.1.

Ownership with a Nonpecuniary Clientele
Coming back to the framework used to study pricing, we can examine ownership patterns

by substituting expected returns into each group’s first-order condition. These are neatly
summarized as deviations from market weights:
Group 1: 𝐰𝐰1 = 𝐰𝐰𝑚𝑚 −

Group 2: 𝐰𝐰2 = 𝐰𝐰𝑚𝑚 +
14

𝛾𝛾 𝑎𝑎1 + 𝑎𝑎2

𝚺𝚺 −1 𝐞𝐞

For example:

ication%20_%20The%20Bond%20Buyer.pdf .

21

As is intuitive, Group 2 investors, with their environmental objective, overweight securities with
positive environmental scores and vice-versa. The magnitude of the overweights are a function
of the environmental score and the relative size of Group 2. When Group 2 is small and the
environmental score is extreme, the overweights are material. Market clearing requires Group 1
investors to do the opposite. They underweight securities with a positive environmental score
because their equilibrium expected returns are lower, for reasons that are not related to risk.
We can also compute the concentration of holdings. To simplify notation, define the
vector 𝐞𝐞� = 𝚺𝚺 −1 𝐞𝐞. In the case of uncorrelated returns, the elements of 𝐞𝐞� are simply equal to a
𝑒𝑒

security’s environmental score divided by its return variance, or 𝑒𝑒�𝚤𝚤 = 𝜎𝜎2𝑖𝑖 . This is the risk-adjusted
𝑖𝑖

environmental score. Because investors are risk averse, risk reduces the extent to which the score
influences portfolio choice.
We measure ownership concentration using the familiar Herfindahl-Hirschman Index
(HHI), the sum of the squared percentage holdings. For security i,

𝑒𝑒̃ �
𝛾𝛾 𝑎𝑎1 + 𝑎𝑎2 𝑖𝑖
𝛾𝛾 𝑎𝑎1 + 𝑎𝑎2 𝑖𝑖
𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖
𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖

where ci is a constant equal to the total market value of security i. Holding constant total capital
at 𝑎𝑎1 + 𝑎𝑎2 , this sum is minimized when the risk-adjusted environmental score is zero or when

there are no investors with an environmental preference so that a2 is equal to zero. In both cases,
the holdings are constant across all investors, and hence concentration is minimized. As the
number of investors becomes large, this total approaches zero. By contrast, holding constant the
proportions of investor types, the sum is maximized at extreme levels of the risk-adjusted
environmental score. The derivative of HHI with respect to 𝑒𝑒̃𝑖𝑖 is:
2 𝑎𝑎1 𝑎𝑎2
𝑒𝑒̃
𝛾𝛾 2 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖2 𝑎𝑎1 +𝑎𝑎2 𝑖𝑖
22

HHI is a parabola with a minimum at zero—concentration is minimized for a security with a
neutral environmental score. Securities with extreme scores, whether favorable or unfavorable,
have higher ownership concentration.
Although green bonds are difficult to short in practice, we have not precluded short
positions here for simplicity, so the HHI is not bounded in the usual way. But, one can see that
with two investor types, it is possible to get to maximum concentration even without short
positions. For example, suppose that there is a single individual in Group 2 with environmental
preferences, so that a2 is equal to 1, and that the risk-adjusted environmental score is large
enough to make the optimal weight in Group 1 exactly equal to zero. This is an example of
maximal concentration: a single investor holds the entire capitalization of the security.
To build further intuition, consider the case where a1 = a2 = a. Since we have assumed
that each investor has one dollar in order to discuss ownership concentration, in equilibrium the
total number of investors N equals the total capitalization of all securities C, i.e., N = a1 + a2 = 2a
= C. After some algebra, this allows us to write equilibrium concentration in a more intuitive
form:
2

1
1
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖 = + �
� 𝑒𝑒̃𝑖𝑖 2
𝑐𝑐
𝑖𝑖
𝑁𝑁
2𝛾𝛾 � �
𝐶𝐶

The HHI parabola rests at its theoretical minimum value of 1/N, the uniform ownership that
would obtain if investors were homogenous or if the risk-adjusted environmental score is zero.
Concentration then rises as the risk-adjusted score moves away from zero in either direction.
Here, we can also see that the effect of environmental scores is stronger when the security has a
smaller weight in the market portfolio and when risk aversion is low, so that Group 1 investors

23

are willing to tilt their portfolios more aggressively in response to differences in price and Group
2 in response to differences in environmental benefits.

Prediction 2: Securities with positive environmental scores (such as green bonds) have more
concentrated ownership, particularly for those with low market values and low risk.

Again, this is based on a symmetric effect. If there were a set of particularly non-green securities
that could be measured sensibly on the same spectrum, they will also be held in greater
concentration. This observation may be useful in the sin stocks context. In our empirical setting
of municipal bonds, however, the situation is simpler. There is a small set of green bonds, with
high environmental scores, and a large set of ordinary bonds, with scores near zero.
4.2.

Ownership Data
Bond ownership data are from the Thomson Reuters eMAXX database, used by

Manconi, Massa, and Yasuda (2012) and others, which includes fixed income positions of
thousands of U.S. and international insurance companies, pension funds, and mutual funds.
Insurance company holdings are based on NAIC disclosures; mutual fund holdings are based on
SEC disclosures; and pension fund holdings are disclosed voluntarily.
Our ownership sample is based on twelve quarters of reported holdings of municipal
bonds from the first quarter of 2014 through the last quarter of 2016. Ownership summary
statistics are in Table 7. Most smaller bonds do not appear in eMAXX because they are owned
entirely by retail investors or small institutions. For bonds that do appear, a majority of par
amount outstanding is owned within eMAXX. In particular, green bonds have a mean of 61.9%

24

of par amount outstanding held within eMAXX and ordinary bonds have a mean of 58.6%
ownership within the database.
Next, we use the fund name to estimate the percentage of par outstanding held by
concerned investors. Specifically, we proxy for whether a fund has “green” concerns based on
whether it has a substring in its eMAXX fund name that indicates an association with socially
responsible investing. 15 This substantially undercounts the number of investors that actually
consider social objectives, since many such funds do not include one of these substrings in their
names. Nonetheless, even this methodology indicates that green bonds are disproportionately
held by socially-oriented investors. For the average green bond in this subsample, 13.5% of par
outstanding can be associated with a socially-responsible fund through the fund’s name. In
contrast, for the average ordinary bond in this subsample, only 0.6% can be associated with a
socially responsible fund. This shows that green bonds are recognized by the types of concerned
investors one would expect.
We use HHI as a more formal estimate of ownership concentration that maps into the
analytical framework. We estimate concentration under the assumption that the distribution of
holdings is the same across investors outside the eMAXX database as we observe within it. To
balance coverage against measurement error in the calculation of HHI, at least 25% of a bond’s
par outstanding must be reported within eMAXX. When calculating HHI we use ownership data
from the first quarter for which this level of bond ownership is available. Since eMAXXreporting institutions often buy municipal bonds at the issue date and hold for long periods, often
to maturity, most of our ownership data reflect the cross-section of holdings that prevails within

15

The substrings are: CALVERT, CATHOLIC, CHURCH, CLEAN, DOMINI, ENVIRON, ESG, FAITH, GREEN,
IMPACT, KLD, PARNASSUS, SOCIAL, SRI, WALDEN.

25

one quarter of the issue date. In all, we are able to calculate HHI for 436 green bonds and 70,690
ordinary bonds.
The table shows no univariate difference in HHI between green and ordinary bonds, but
this is inconclusive because we need to control for various differences in bond characteristics
between green and ordinary bonds. For example, green bonds are larger, so they are likely to
have a broader investor base and lower HHI, all else equal, which may obscure the predicted
positive green effect on concentration.
4.3.

Ownership Regressions
Our regression tests involving green bond ownership concentration are in Table 8. We

simply include the same controls and fixed effects to be consistent with the yield regressions,
although maturityXratingXissue-month effects, for example, are less needed than in the case of
yield regressions.
In all specifications, green bonds are held in greater concentration, all else equal. The
relationship is statistically significant and economically plausible. Controlling for numerous
bond, month, and issuer characteristics, HHI is on the order of 0.05 higher for green bonds,
which can be viewed in the context of the sample’s unconditional bond HHI of 0.79.
As in the case of yields, CBI certified green bonds provide especially strong support for
model predictions. The total predicted difference in concentration between a CBI certified green
bond and an ordinary bond, all else equal, is the sum of the two coefficients reported in Table 8.
For example, the first specification suggests that relative to ordinary bonds with similar
characteristics, HHI is 0.04 higher for green bonds but 0.24 higher for CBI certified green bonds.
The extent to which this effect is causal is unclear, but, as with the pricing results it seems likely

26

that there is a degree of causality, given that certification is costly and its explicit purpose is to
improve the marketing of the bond to concerned investors.
As mentioned above, the theoretical framework predicts that concentration of green
bonds should be particularly high when the bond is relatively small and low risk, therefore
presenting relatively small consequences for investor-level portfolio weights or disutility due to
risk aversion. We turn to these finer predictions in Table 9.
We define a green bond as “small” if it is below the top quintile of the full sample bond
size distribution. Since green bonds are larger than ordinary bonds, as confirmed in Table 3, this
roughly divides the green sample into equal halves, small and large (i.e., not small). Almost all
green bonds are investment grade, so risk, like size, is a relative concept in this market. We
define a bond as “low risk” if its rating is AAA, which is the modal municipal green bond rating
and which also divides the sample of green bonds with ownership data roughly into halves.
The results in Table 9 support these two finer predictions. AAA-rated, effectively riskless
green bonds have an HHI between 0.03 and 0.08 higher than other bonds, controlling for various
combinations of fixed effects. Green bonds that are not in the top size quintile have an HHI
between 0.07 and 0.10 higher than other bonds, controlling for various combinations of fixed
effects. As in the previous table, there remains a strong and distinct effect of CBI certification
and ownership concentration.
Overall, the ownership results tie together the yield findings and a simple analytical
framework. A subset of investors appears willing to sacrifice some return to hold green bonds,
particularly “certified” green bonds. Green bonds are held disproportionately by these investors.
Ownership is further concentrated in smaller and riskless green bonds.

27

Conclusion
The need for climate change solutions is imminent, and green bonds are currently the

front-line response offered by the financial markets. In this paper, we study the U.S. corporate
and municipal green bond markets. Our work complements other research in climate finance
which focus on how investors might measure and manage climate risks.
We start with a history and overview of the U.S. green bond markets and basic bond
characteristics. We then narrow the focus to the municipal bond sample, since there are currently
far more green municipal bonds than green corporate bonds available for study and much of the
response to climate change necessarily involves public infrastructure of some form.
A simple asset pricing framework that incorporates an investor preference for
nonpecuniary attributes—in our application, a preference for green versus ordinary bonds—
makes two predictions. The first is that green bonds will sell for a premium. After controlling for
numerous fixed and time-varying factors, we find that green bonds indeed are issued at a
premium, with yields lower by several basis points. This is a natural flip side to the Hong and
Kacperczyk (2009) result from equities markets that sin stocks are associated with higher returns.
The second prediction is that green bond ownership is more concentrated, with a subset of
investors holding them at higher weights, particularly when the par value is small or the bond is
especially low risk. The data also support those predictions.
Overall, the most natural explanation is that a subset of investors is willing to sacrifice
some return to hold green bonds, which is consistent with other findings in the SRI literature. An
additional finding with practical implications is that both the pricing and ownership effects,
while apparent across green bonds, are stronger among bonds that are certified by external

28

verifiers. This has practical implications for green bond issuers and supports efforts to create
standards upon which certifications could be granted.

Table 4. Offering yields of green and ordinary municipal bonds. Data on municipal bond characteristics
come from Mergent. Corporate bond characteristics are from Bloomberg. Pre-tax yields come directly from
Mergent and Bloomberg data. After-tax yields are calculated for a hypothetical investor paying the marginal tax
rates prevailing at the highest levels of income; calculations use Mergent data on bonds’ tax status and data
from the Tax Policy Center on federal tax rates. State-level year-specific tax rates come from the Taxsim model
of the National Bureau of Economic Research. Calculations for each bond use the tax rates prevailing in the
year of issuance.

ordinary least-squares regressions of after-tax bond yields at issue in basis points on green bond
indicators and other bond characteristics and fixed effects described in Table 3. Bond size and total
issue size categories (across bonds by that issuer, on that day) are deciles. After-tax yields are
calculated using Mergent, Tax Policy Center, and NBER data as described in notes to Table 4. “Green”
is a dummy variable for bonds that Bloomberg tags as green. “CBI Certified” is a dummy variable for
green bonds that also carry Climate Bonds Initiative green certification. T-statistics are reported in
brackets.

Table 7. Ownership of green and ordinary municipal bonds. Data are based on combining Mergent data on bond characteristics with Bloomberg data
identifying green bonds and eMAXX data on institutional ownership of individual bonds. eMAXX Ownership is the percentage of bond par value
accounted for by eMAXX-reporting institutions. Green Fund Ownership is the percentage of bonds owned by a fund that has some green or social
investing orientation, based on whether the fund has any of the following strings in its name: CALVERT, CATHOLIC, CHURCH, CLEAN, DOMINI,
ENVIRON, ESG, FAITH, GREEN, IMPACT, KLD, PARNASSUS, SOCIAL, SRI, WALDEN. HHI is the Hirschman-Herfindahl Index, calculated as
the sum of the squared values of ownership shares. Higher values reflect more ownership concentration, with a value of 1 reflecting a single owner
owning all of the bond and 0 reflecting infinite dispersion of ownership. When eMAXX-reporting owners hold less than the total par outstanding, HHI is
calculated assuming that the distribution of ownership shares in that universe match what is observed within the eMAXX universe. We require at least
25% eMAXX ownership to calculate HHI. The sample runs from 2014 to 2016 and HHI is calculated for 70,690 ordinary bonds and 436 green bonds
with sufficient ownership data and control variables. Standard errors for differenes are clustered by issuer.
