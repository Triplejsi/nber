models to demand management purposes, the price adjustment equations that have

in practice are open to a number of objections.

At the most

sympathetic level, one objection is that most of the utilized specifications
fail to satisfy the natural rate hypothesis. i.e., the hypothesis that there
is no path of price level or nominal demand values that will keep unemployment
permanently below its natural-rate value.'0

This hypothesis, which expresses

the notion that it is not possible for a society to permanently enrich Itself

theorists and Is paid lip service by most Keynesian writers, but is violated

to business cycle

All readers will be aware that this line of work began with Lucas's

(1972) celebrated theory of a Phillips—type relationship between nominal and
real variables that results from confusion due to information gaps, not from
price stickiness per se.

Most readers will also know that Lucas's theory has

Existing equilibrium models are ones in which all prices are perfectly
