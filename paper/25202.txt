Moving Beyond the Valley of Death: Regulation and Venture Capital Investments in Early-Stage
Biopharmaceutical Firms

ABSTRACT
Can regulation reduce risks associated with investing in early-stage firms? Using the passage of
the European Orphan Drug Act (EU-ODA), we examine this question in the biopharmaceutical
industry. We provide causal evidence that venture capitalists (VCs) are more likely to invest in
early-stage firms operating in sub-fields disproportionately affected by EU-ODA. The switch to
early-stage investments appears strongest among VCs that previously faced greater levels of
information asymmetry. We also find that the level of syndication declined for early-stage
investments and exit performance improved. We conclude discussing the implications of our
findings for public policy, entrepreneurship and innovation.

INTRODUCTION

Extant research shows that many startups find it difficult to secure early-stage funding
(Kerr and Nanda, 2011). A notable reason for this shortage is the difficulty in valuing these firms;
they often involve novel scientific approaches or target new markets. They also often lack
verifiable measures such as publications, patents, products, or sales that can be useful in
objectively estimating the commercial feasibility and value of a venture. In the absence of such
measures nascent firms may turn to alternative signals to convey quality (e.g., Hsu and Ziedonis,
2013; Higgins et al., 2011; Nicholson et al., 2005; Stuart et al., 1999; Audretsch and Stephan,
1996; Podolny, 1993). However, in these cases VCs often have to depend on their ‘gut feelings’
thereby making early-stage deal valuation as much an art as it is a science (Huang and Pearce,
2015).
This information asymmetry has led to the concern that VCs underfinance high-tech
ventures that push the scientific frontier (e.g., Dimov and Murray, 2008; Parhankangas, 2007;
Auerswald and Branscomb, 2003) resulting in a rotation from early-stage to late-stage
investments (Lerner, 2009). Within the biopharmaceutical industry some have argued that VCs
have begun to herd into similar technologies (Dimov and Murray, 2008; Auerswald and
Branscomb, 2003). Others have suggested that the lack of early-stage funding has slowed the
transition from the ‘valley of death’ thereby hindering productivity (Hudson and Khazragui,
2013).
This paper examines whether regulation can effectively be used to help alleviate these
information asymmetries (Alvarez-Garrido, 2015; Milanesi et al., 2013; Schwienbacher, 2013)
and drive investment towards early-stage firms. Empirical work linking regulation and venture
capital is sparse.1 To fill this gap we exploit the introduction of the Orphan Drug Act in the

Stern (2003) find that SBIR awardees performed better in industries that attracted more VC investment.

European Union (EU-ODA) in 2000. The EU-ODA was designed to incentivize and facilitate
treatments for rare diseases. We present causal evidence that the EU-ODA increased early-stage
VC investments by five percent, on average, for firms operating in biopharmaceutical sub-fields
affected by the policy.
Unintendedly, the provisions of the EU-ODA provided investors credible signals about
the scientific viability of novel drug candidates and clarity on their potential market value. We
find that the dissipation of information asymmetries allowed VCs to shift from late-stage to earlystage investments when investing in EU-based startups, relative to US-based startups. This
suggests that the expected return for EU-based startups increased relative to their counterparts in
the US. Interestingly, we also find that new investments were more likely to come from US-based
VCs as opposed to EU-based VCs. US-based VCs faced greater levels of information
asymmetries due to their distance but it appears that the benefits from EU-ODA were a
significant mechanism enough to induce cross-border investment.
In addition to causing VC investment to shift to earlier stages we also find that the level
of syndication declined in early-round investments. This suggests that the informationprovisioning role of the EU-ODA, for early-stage startups, diminishes the need for peer input and
evaluation that comes from syndication. It also suggests that benefits conferred by the EU-ODA
outweigh the potential value-adding activities normally attributed to syndication (e.g.,
Chemmanur and Tian, 2011; Casamatta and Haritchabalet, 2007; Brander et al., 2002).
Additionally the amount raised in these early rounds does not change after EU-ODA, which
suggests that VCs had been using syndication as a way to decrease risk related to early-stage
investments.
Lastly, we document a significant increase in exit performance for our focal EU-ODA
treated firms. Notably, this increase was in the form of IPOs versus acquisitions, reversing a trend
observed over the recent past (Gao et al., 2013). It appears that the signals conferred by the EUODA allowed VCs to select higher quality firms earlier and move them to IPO. This trend

3

reversal should be viewed positively for investors since IPOs, on average, have higher returns
than acquisitions (Smith et al., 2011). Importantly, we do not see any statistically significant
difference in bankruptcies for firms affected by the EU-ODA. This suggests that the mitigation in
risk due to the signals of the EU-ODA make these treated investments no more risky (in terms of
failure) than control investments. This is important evidence that demonstrates the role regulation
can play in mitigating market failures that may exist due to information asymmetries, opening the
door to private investment.
EUROPEAN UNION REGULATION 141/200: ORPHAN DRUG ACT
The first Orphan Drug Act enacted anywhere was by the US in 1983 (US-ODA). It was
intended to facilitate the development of treatments for rare diseases (Grabowski, 2005; Rohde,
2000). Most rare diseases remain “orphans” because market sizes are too small to justify their
development costs. To solve this market failure, the US-ODA provided for a variety of incentives
to firms. The considerable success of the US-ODA encouraged others, including the EU, to adopt
similar legislation (Yin, 2008; Cheung et al., 2004; Lichtenberg and Waldfogel, 2003). The EU’s
adoption of their Orphan Drug Act occurred in December 1999 and it was implemented starting
in January 2000.2
In order to file for orphan designation in the EU the prevalence of the underlying disease
must be below five per 10,000 of the EU population. Exceptions exist in cases where the expected
return on investment is insufficient to justify a drug’s development costs. The EU also considers
whether the condition being treated is life threatening and if there exists a current treatment (or if
the proposed treatment provides significant benefit over an existing drug). Key aspects of the
application include discussions on the scientific rationale and medical plausibility of a drug
candidate. Firms may file for orphan designation at any time during the development process up
until they file for marketing authorization for the drug. In reality, however, applications need to

be filed 8-12 months prior to a submission for marketing approval given the time delays by the
Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) to process applications.
Receiving orphan drug status confers several key benefits to a firm including: protocol
assistance and follow-up, reduced/waived regulatory fees, accelerated approval pathways and
extensions to market exclusivity. Importantly, orphan status provides an assessment by the
COMP of the medical plausibility of a drug candidate. It is this assessment that provides key
scientific information to the market about the viability and risk of a drug candidate. In the EU,
new drugs are awarded eight years of market exclusivity. The granting of orphan status confers
another two years of market exclusivity, for a total of 10 years.3 Another two years is available
(for a total of 12 years) if the drug targets a pediatric indication.4 Moreover, the granting of
orphan status limits approvals of other drugs for the same indication unless they can be shown to
provide significant benefit over an existing treatment (Hall and Carlson, 2014).5
All of these incentives were designed to encourage pharmaceutical innovation directed
towards rare diseases. The evidence appears to suggest that the ODAs in the US and EU have
been successful (Stockklausner et al., 2016). For example, since its passage in 1983, close to
3,000 drugs have received orphan drug status with 448 approvals in the US. In the EU,
designations exceed 1,200 with nearly 100 approvals (Hall and Carlson, 2014). The ODAs are not
without their detractors, however, where issues of gaming and high prices in the US have recently
been called into question.6
Finally, the EU-ODA includes provisions that make some of the benefits tagged to
protocol assistance and fee waivers more generous for small and medium size firms. As noted in

3

In contrast, in the US chemical-based drugs are awarded five years of market exclusivity with orphan
drug status conferring another two years for a total of seven years.

During market exclusivity generics are unable to enter the market. While this confirms monopoly
positions to these firms, drug prices are regulated in the EU.
5
There are exceptions to these rules, for example if the original firm provides their consent or if they are
unable to supply enough product. See Hall and Carlson (2014) for a more extensive discussion.

Figure 1, the EU-ODA does not include the same kind of R&D tax credits that exist in the US. It
is important to note that the intention of the EU-ODA was to incentivize development of
treatments for rare diseases; it was not intended per se to solve potential underfinancing of
nascent firms. We could not find any relevant discussion of this topic in the legislative record. As
such, for the purposes of providing an information-provisioning role to VCs and steering
investment towards these firms, the EU-ODA can plausibly be viewed as an exogenous shock.
This will be important for identification as parties might a priori behave strategically, a topic we
return to below.
VENTURE FINANCING OF EARLY-STAGE FIRMS
Most biopharmaceutical startups lack the financial resources to take a product all the way
to market. These firms largely depend on outside funding, especially during their nascent stages.
It is at this stage of development, unfortunately, that conventional means of financing is severely
limited (e.g., Budish et al., 2015; Murray, 1999; Myers and Majluf, 1984). Traditionally, VCs
have filled this financing gap and carried firms forward to a liquidity event. Moreover, early-stage
biopharmaceutical firms are notoriously difficult to value as many are working on innovative
products at the frontier of technology and often lack publications, patents or products necessary to
evaluate their commercial viability (Higgins et al., 2011; Gans et al., 2008). As such, investments
in these firms often depend on the ‘gut feelings’ of VCs (Huang and Knight, 2017; Huang and
Pearce, 2015) or other less traditional signals (e.g., Hsu and Ziedonis, 2013; Higgins et al., 2011;
Nicholson et al., 2005; Stuart et al., 1999; Audretsch and Stephan, 1996; Podolny, 1993) .
These difficulties make investors seeking to fund early-stage startups vulnerable to
information asymmetry problems such as adverse selection and moral hazard (e.g., Wu, 2016;
Kerr et al., 2014). The problems compound when VCs do not have the specialized scientific
knowledge to fully understand the nuances of startup technologies (Schwienbacher, 2013). Some
have argued that VCs have responded to these challenges by switching from financing
exploratory to exploitative ventures that are easier to understand and shifting from early- to late-

6

stage firms (Alvarez-Garrido, 2015). The net effect of this herding behavior (Scharfstein and
Stein, 1990) is that many firms suffer a financing gap in their early-stages or when they are at
their so-called “valley of death” (Hudson and Khazragui, 2013).
Signaling Effects of the ODA
There is a vast literature on the role that signals play in markets dating back to Spence
(1974). Effective signals can moderate the market failure problem caused by information
asymmetry (e.g., Gorry and Useche, 2017; Heeley et al., 2007; Mann, 2004; Long, 2002). For
example, in the context of entrepreneurial finance, prior work has demonstrated the signaling role
of status (e.g., Stuart et al., 1999; Podolny, 1993), star-scientists (e.g., Higgins et al., 2011;
Zucker et al., 2002; Zucker and Darby, 1997), alliance partners (Nicholson et al., 2005), venture
capital backing (Meggison and Weiss, 1991), prestige of the underwriter (Higgins and Gulati,
2003; Meggison and Weiss, 1991) and university connections (Fuller and Rothaermel 2012;
Audretsch and Stephan, 1996). Directly relevant to our study is the literature examining the role
that regulation and policy play in providing government-backed signals so that the private sector
can reasonably estimate the commercial and scientific viability of a project (e.g., Hoenig and
Henkel, 2015; Useche, 2014; Hsu and Ziedonis, 2013).7
The EU-ODA provides two different signals that are beneficial in decreasing information
asymmetries that we will categorize as scientific-based and market-based. Scientific-based
signals are ones that help a VC understand and form estimates about the scientific viability of a
project while market-based signals help estimate the economic viability of projects. If we
consider a simple expected profit function: E(Π) = ρ(TR – TC), where E(Π) is defined as
expected profit, TR is defined as the sum of all future discounted revenues, TC is the sum of all
future discounted costs and ρ represents some estimated probability that those revenues and costs
will be realized. Effectively what the EU-ODA does is increase (or bring clarity to) TR, decrease
7

Unlike prior literature that has studied the impact of government grants, awards and funding on
subsequent venture capital financing (e.g., Islam et al., 2018), here the companies are not receiving
funding. Rather, the signal is coming in the form of scientific validation and additional market protections.

7

TC and improve estimates of ρ, all of which should either individually or collectively increase
expected profits.
Expanding on the above, the early scientific review by regulators during the EU-ODA
application process should improve clarity about the viability of a drug candidate. Because of
this early review, orphan designation is often seen as a ‘golden badge’. Essentially the EU-ODA
transforms unobservable information about the quality of novel drugs into observable
information, thereby decreasing the VC’s cost of acquiring information necessary to make more
informed decisions. Ultimately, this should translate into better approximations of transition
probabilities and ultimately improved estimates of ρ.8 The additional years of market exclusivity
and limits on approvals of other drugs within the same therapeutic category should improve
estimates of TR. It is important to note that the restrictions on other drugs do not include those
that are shown to be superior. As such, revenue estimates still remain probabilistic. Finally, fee
waivers and protocol assistance should reduce TC.
Cross-border Venture Investing
Entrepreneurial financing markets vary across regions. The VC market in the US is large,
mature and relatively established compared to other regions. As such, US-based VCs regularly
make cross-border investments to other regions, such as the EU and Asia, where entrepreneurial
financing markets are still being grown (Iriyama et al., 2010; Loree and Guisinger, 1995). Due to
the positive impacts of the foreign investments on entrepreneurial activities and innovation in the
host country, many governments have pursued policies that make foreign investments more
favorable (Kim and Li, 2014; Globerman and Shapiro, 1999).
Likewise, the information and signals provided by the EU-ODA acted in a similar
manner, causing an increase in the flow of VC investments into EU-based firms from non-EU
based investors. Compared to domestic VCs foreign VCs often face greater levels of information

8

In a different context, research has demonstrated the positive signaling effects of regulatory certification
in the case of the ISO 9000 Quality Management Standard (Terlaak and King, 2006).

8

asymmetries when valuing local, early-stage firms (Vedula and Matusik, 2017; Dai et al., 2012).
In our context, EU-based VCs can more easily access information sources such as local networks,
referrals from domestic firms or local government, and informal reputation that can be either
directly or indirectly used to verify a local firm’s quality. While information may be observable
by local VCs, the same information may not be equivalently observable to foreign VCs due to
factors such as geographic distance and/or cultural/linguistic differences (Bruton and Ahlstrom,
2003). Hence, the government-backed designations, such as that provided under EU-ODA, can
turn less explicit information into more observable signals, thereby lowering the uncertainty
surrounding US-based investments in EU-based firms (Zacharakis et al., 2007). We argue that
this may be a positive externality created in our context for cross-border venture investments and
we examine if this indeed holds in our analysis.
Venture Capital Syndication
VC deal syndication refers to two or more funds participating in an equity stake for a
given investment and financing round. The argued benefits behind syndication include: improved
deal quality selection; peer evaluation of technology; ‘better’ or more accurate valuations;
improved guidance to investee firms; and a way to decrease VC portfolio risk (e.g., Gompers et
al., 2016; Jääskeläinen et al., 2007; Wright and Lockett, 2003; Brander et al., 2002; Gompers and
Lerner, 2000; Lerner, 1994). Unfortunately, these benefits do not come without potential costs.
Casamatta and Haritchabalet (2007) argue that during the selection process VCs will ‘tip their
hand’ and reveal potential deals to syndicate partners who themselves could turn into competitors
for the deal.
Information and benefits provided by the EU-ODA could diminish the need for earlystage deal syndication in several ways. First, the medical and scientific review should decrease
the need for peer evaluation of an underlying technology. The granting of orphan status should
also serve as a signal of quality and improve overall deal selection, again reducing the need for
peer evaluation. Second, the extensions to market exclusivity and limits on potential competition

9

should improve a VC’s ability to value the firm. Finally, the cost benefits of EU-ODA, on the
margin, may decrease the need for funds making it less likely that a VC may want or need to
spread risk across other firms.
EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY & DATA
Methodology
To tease out the causal relationship between EU-ODA and VC investments, we employ a
difference-in-differences (DiD) approach to compare subfields primarily affected by EU-ODA to
non-affected subfields, as we discuss more fully below. We estimate the following equation:
1

𝑌!"# = 𝛼! + 𝛾! + 𝑋! + 𝛽! (𝐷𝑟𝑢𝑔 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑! ) + 𝛽! (𝐴𝑓𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑂𝐷𝐴! )
+ 𝛽! { 𝐷𝑟𝑢𝑔 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑! ) ∗ (𝐴𝑓𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑂𝐷𝐴! } + 𝜀!"#

where Yijt is defined as the various outcome variables we explore (i.e., timing of investment, the
number of investors per round, invested amount per round and exit performance), i indexes
individual investments at the investee-round-investor level (𝑖 ∈ {1...44,867}), j indexes industry
categories (𝑗 ∈ {1...12}), and t indexes the year (𝑡 ∈ {1989...2011}). Drug related is a dummy
variable that equals one if an investment is in the EU-ODA affected subfields (treatment group),
zero otherwise. After ODA is a dummy variable equal to one if an investment occurred after 2000,
zero otherwise. Xi is a vector of control variables that includes: location of the startup
headquarters, location of the investor firm headquarters, and type of investors.
The coefficient of interest is β2. The coefficient captures the difference in the outcome
variables of the treatment group relative to the control group as a result of the treatment by the
EU-ODA. To assign the treatment and the control groups, we use the fact that EU-ODA
disproportionately affects firms pursuing development of novel drugs for human diseases. Among
the investment categories in VentureExpert relating to medical, health and life sciences, we
categorized the following into our treatment group: Biotech-Human, Med/Health Products,
Medical Diagnostics, Medical Therapeutics and Pharmaceuticals. The control group consists of

10

investment categories in the medical, health and life sciences not directly related to developing
treatments for human disorders: Biosensors, Biotech Equipment, Biotech Other, Biotech
Research, Biotech Animal, Biotech Industrial, and Med/Health Services.9
Finally, it is possible that the composition of VCs may somehow change after EU-ODA.
For example, there may be entry of new VCs into drug-related fields for reasons other than the
EU-ODA. If this happened then our DiD would only capture the impact of how investment
patterns of entrant VCs differed from incumbent VCs, but not the changes of incumbent VCs
caused by EU-ODA. To account for this possibility we report both OLS and fixed effect models
with the intuition being that new VC entry will be controlled for by technology category, investor
and time fixed effects.10
Data and Variables
Our data comes from VentureXpert and we start by collecting the population of global
investments between 1989 and 2011 in the medical, health and life science categories. We
exclude observations that do not disclose essential information such as: investment date,
investment stage, industry category and other major characteristics of investing firms. This leaves
us with a final dataset of 44,867 investments made to 6,643 startups by 3,072 investing firms. A
time trend of investments by year is presented in Appendix Figure 1 and summary statistics are
presented in Table 1.
Our primary unit of analysis is at the investee-investor-investment round level. Our
startups, on average, receive investments over 3.9 rounds. Each round, on average, includes 4.8
investors and raises $12.8 million. The average time difference between a startup’s founding and
an investment is 2,119 days (i.e., six years). Approximately 21 percent of investments are made in
9

Modifications in the composition of the treatment and the control groups do not change the nature of
results. For example, if we include Biotech Research and Biotech Other in the treatment instead of the
control group our findings remain consistent. We include Medical Diagnostics in the treatment group
because these technologies, such as biomarkers, are complements to drug development. If we move them
from the treatment to control group our results remain unchanged.
10
In addition to the OLS and the FE models we report in the paper we also report logit regressions in the
Appendix. Results remain consistent.

11

early-stage start-ups; 67 percent of investors and 80 percent of startups are located in the US,
which aligns with the observation that the US has been the locus of global biopharmaceutical
research.
To explore the timing of VC investments we construct three variables. First, we define
Early-stage as a dummy variable equal to one if VentureExpert classifies an investment as earlystage, zero otherwise. Kaplan and Lerner (2016) note that defining what early-stage is sometimes
is not straight forward in the context of the venture investments. However, VentureExpert
captures this explicitly through a variable.11 We follow prior work (Atanasov et al (2007)) and
use this variable in our analysis.
Second, because an early-stage investment can occur across firms of different ages we
define Time to investment that measures the time between firm founding and the investment. If
the EU-ODA causes investments to shift to early-stages, then the first variable will detect that
effect. However, if the EU-ODA simply moves investments in the early-stage back further, this
effect will be captured by our second variable. Lastly, we additionally define Time to initial
investment by restricting samples to the set of the first investment that each startup ever received.
This is to circumvent the issue of possible problems in how our data providers measure Early
Stage and our results still remain consistent.
We control for the type of VC making the investment and categorize them as independent
venture capital (IVC), corporate venture capital (CVC), government-backed venture capital (GVC)
or an angel investor (Angel). Again, we depend on VentureExpert’s classification of VC type. We
also control for whether the start-up was based in the US (US startup) or EU (EU startup) and
whether the VC investor was based in the US (US investor) or EU (EU investor). In all cases
these variables are defined as dummies that equal one if it falls within one of these categories,
zero otherwise. In order to determine the number of VCs involved in syndication we count the
number of investors participating in a single round (Number of investors).
11

See for a variable list: https://vx.thomsonib.com/VxComponent/vxhelp/VEglossary.htm

12

To investigate the investment performance of VCs, we define several dummy variables to
capture both startup success and failure. An investment is considered a success if it leads to a
liquidity event for the VC. We define M&A as a dummy variable that equals one if a VC-backed
investment exits through merger or acquisition, zero otherwise. We also define IPO as a dummy
variable that equals one if the VC-backed investment exits through an initial public offering, zero
otherwise. Lastly, failure is defined as bankruptcy and we define a dummy variable, Bankruptcy,
equal to one if a startup reports bankruptcy or it is defunct, zero otherwise.
Finally, we recognize that measuring the impact of EU-ODA on performance is
challenging because startups founded prior to 2000 may continue to receive investments after
2000. To avoid any contamination we restrict our sample to startups that received an early-stage
investment in the five years prior to EU-ODA to those that received an investment in five years
after EU-ODA. Details are provided in performance analysis in Section 5.3 below.
Identification

Our identification strategy relies on the fact that the control group is not exposed
to treatment in either period. To formally test the parallel trend assumption we take our
pre-trend data (before 2000) and split it in half, defining the midpoint (1994) as an
arbitrary treatment event and estimate our diff-in-diffs specification. If the parallel trend
assumption is violated the coefficient 𝛽! will be statistically significant. The results for
this placebo test are reported in Table 2 for each of our three different dependent
variables. Across all models, the coefficient of interest, 𝛽! , is not statistically significant.
Hence, these placebo test results suggest that the parallel trends assumption is not
violated.
RESULTS
Impact of EU-ODA on Likelihood, Timing and Location of VC Investments

13

Table 3 reports results related to the impact of EU-ODA on timing and location of
venture capital investments. The dependent variable is Early-stage in Models 1 and 2, Time to
investment in Models 3 and 4 and Time to initial investment in Models 5 and 6. Across all six
models our coefficient of interest is β2 or the interaction (Drug related * After ODA). Given the
number of controls in the regression we report our main independent variables in Table 3 while
the full set of estimates are reported in Appendix Table 1. Models 1 and 2 show that VCs are 3.7
to 5 percent more likely to make early-stage investments in EU-ODA-related fields. This
translates into roughly 2,000 new early-stage investments. Results in Models 3 to 6 show that
VCs shift their investments forward by 1 to 2 years.
The coefficients from the OLS regressions in Models 1, 3 and 5 are greater than those
from the fixed effect models in Models 2, 4 and 6. Recall that the OLS model takes into account
both the change of pre-existing VCs as well as newly established VCs, while the fixed effect
models include only pre-existing VCs. Taken together, the results imply that the EU-ODA
promotes the entry of new VCs in EU-ODA-related fields, who fund much younger startups than
incumbent investors do.12
Table 4 reports the variation of the EU-ODA impact over the location of VCs. We report
results across two different dependent variables, Early-stage and Time to investment. Our main
independent variables are displayed in Table 4 while the full set of estimates are reported in
Appendix Table 6. In Models 1 and 2 we restrict the sample to investments in EU-based startups
by EU-based VCs, while in Models 3 and 4 we restrict the sample to investments in EU-based
startups by US-based VCs.13 The results suggest that the causal impact of the EU-ODA on

To ensure that our results are not sensitive to our selection of time frames we repeat the analysis in
Models 1 and 2 with three, five and seven year windows (Appendix Table 2). We repeat the same three,

4 we replicate Table 3 using a multinomial logit regression and in Appendix Table 5 we replicate Table 3
using alternative definitions of the treatment group. Results remain robust across these specifications.
13 We did not include the regressions with the subsamples of the first investments because the number of
initial investments into EU startups made by US-based VCs is too small to run the fixed effect models.

14

switching to early-stage investments is mainly driven by US-based VCs rather than EU-based
VCs.
The fact that US-based VCs significantly increase early-stage investments in EU-based
startups implies that foreign-based VCs suffered from greater levels of information asymmetries
related to valuing EU-based startups relative to their EU-based counterparts. Geographic distance,
cultural differences, and/or a lack of understanding about the local market possibly kept US-based
VCs out of the market. The observable signals provided by the EU-ODA (directly and indirectly)
help US-based VCs overcome the “liability of foreignness” and induce cross-border investments
into EU-based startups. Consistent with prior work on signals (e.g., Conti et al., 2013a and
2013b; Higgins et al., 2011), the results in Table 4 seem to suggest that the information signaling
effects of the EU-ODA have some dynamics inherent in them.
Relatedly, Table 5 separates the sample into VC investments made in EU-based startups
and those made in US-based startups. Again, given the number of controls in the regression we
report our main independent variables in Table 5 while the full set of estimates are reported in
Appendix Table 7. Not surprisingly, the results show that the EU-ODA caused a switch towards
younger firms in the EU (Model 2) but not in the US (Model 4). As expected, the effect is
stronger and more significant among EU-based startups since they are more likely to benefit from
orphan designation in their home market.
Impact of ODA on Syndication of Venture Capital Investments
Table 6 reports the changes in syndication behaviors of investors. Again, given the
number of controls in the regression we report our main independent variables in Table 6 while
the full set of estimates are reported in Appendix Table 8. Overall, Model 1 reports that VCs
increase the use of syndication after EU-ODA in drug-related fields. However, this result is
driven by late-stage investments. This can be seen when we split the sample into early- and late-

15

stage deals. Results in Model 2 indicate that VCs are less likely to syndicate for early-stage deals;
while in Model 3 we see an increase in deal syndication for late-stage deals.14
This diverging pattern suggests that the information conferred by the EU-ODA affects an
investor’s incentive for syndication differently across investment stages. A VC is likely to
syndicate early-stage deals when there is less information available to evaluate a nascent
investment opportunity. As a result, they depend on peer opinion. The signals created by the EUODA appear to be sufficient enough in quality to replace the need for peer opinion. Likewise, if
the EU-ODA changes the expected profit of a start-up, they will become more valuable and
command greater valuations in later rounds of financing. For these firms, we may see the level of
syndication for late stage deals actually increase not because VCs need peer opinion but because
VCs are necessary to pool their investments to meet the size of amount sought by the late-stage
startups in pursuit of big exits.
Results in Table 7 support this view. Again, given the number of controls in the
regression we report our main independent variables in Table 7 while the full set of estimates are
reported in Appendix Table 10. In Model 1 we find an overall increase in amounts invested after
EU-ODA. This result is completely driven by late-stage deals. In Model 3 we find that in EUODA affected fields the amount invested in late-stage deals increased by $1.2 million. In Model 2
we see that the EU-ODA does not have a statistically significant impact on the amount invested in
early-stage deals. Coupled with our prior findings in Table 6, this is important because the
investment amount does not decrease on average, while investments are being shifted to an earlier
stage (i.e., back over the ‘valley of death’) and the level of syndication is declining. In the

14

To test the sensitivity, we repeat the analysis with three, five and seven year windows, which is reported
in Appendix Table 9. The results remain robust to the modifications.

16

absence of any type of risk-mitigation by the benefits of the EU-ODA we would expect to see the
values of investments decline as they are shifted to an earlier stage.15
Impact of EU-ODA on Performance of Venture Capital Investments
In Table 8 we compare the exit performances of startups that received early-stage
investments during the five years prior to the EU-ODA to those for the five years after the EUODA. As before, given the number of controls in the regression we report our main independent
variables in Table 8 while the full set of estimates are reported in Appendix Table 11. Overall, we
see significant differential exit performance between IPOs and acquisitions for our EU-ODA
related fields. Specifically, in Model 2 we find that the rate of exit via IPO increased while in
Model 1 the rate of exit via acquisition decreased. This pattern is a reversal of the general pattern
observed by Gao et al. (2013).16 Given that biopharmaceutical IPOs tend to have higher returns
than acquisitions, this suggests that VCs are able to maximize returns to investors (Gompers et
al., 2016).
There can be two explanations for the improved exit performances. On one hand, the
absolute values of early-stage startups funded by VCs after the EU-ODA could be greater than
those funded prior to the EU-ODA, because the policy signals help VCs identify superior deals.
On the other hand, the switch of exit mode toward IPO might suggest that those parties favoring
exit via IPO appear to be winning any underlying tension relating to mode of exit. This result is
interesting, especially given the conflict of interests between investors and startup founders
within this market. In general, founders and management teams of startups tend to have a
preference for exit via an IPO, while VCs tend to push for a timely liquidity event.17 Further,

15

Relating back to our earlier example, E(Π) = ρ(TR – TC), if investments are shifted back in time
without any mitigation in risk, then ρ would decrease thereby decreasing the expected value of a firm.
This should lead to a lower valuation and, all else equal, a decline in investment.
16
In Appendix Table 12 we replicate Table 8 over alternative time periods (3 and 7 years) and in Appendix
Table 13 we replicate Table 8 using multinomial logit regressions. Results remain robust.
17
“It’s very hard as a venture capitalist, as a professional board member, to tell a management team,
‘you’re going to build this company to be acquired. When these companies get swallowed by larger
entities, the passion dies, the entrepreneurship dies,” said Ted Schlein, a managing partner of Kleiner,

17

among various types of investors, CVCs are reported to be more patient investor groups than
individual VCs because CVCs are interested in the underlying technology rather than the
financial return (Ceccagnoli et al., 2018; Park and Steensma, 2013). Collectively, these results
suggest that the EU-ODA encourages management teams and investors to consider more costly
and time-consuming options for mode of exit.
Finally, the results in Models 3 show that firms receiving early-stage investments after
the EU-ODA do not have significantly greater hazards to exit via bankruptcy than the previously
funded firms. This implies that the investment performance of VCs does not get worse as a result
of the shift toward early-stage deals. In general, a shift towards earlier stage investments should
come with increased risk. However, these results suggest that the signals and information
conferred by EU-ODA were sufficient enough to reduce risk thereby allowing for investments to
be made earlier or back across the ‘valley of death’.
CONCLUSION
Given significant information asymmetries in early-stage investing, underinvestment can
occur. Recent research suggests that VCs may be herding into less risky, later-stage projects.
Such a shift can create funding gaps for early-stage firms. We explore the role that regulation
may be able to play in helping early-stage firms go through the so-called valley-of -death. Using
the regulatory setting of the EU and the passage of the Orphan Drug Act, we examine this
question in the biopharmaceutical industry. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first
papers to empirically demonstrate the causal impact from a reduction in information asymmetry
through governmental regulation on the investment decisions of VCs.
We find that due to the benefits conferred by the EU-ODA VCs shift their investments
towards earlier-stages. The magnitude of the impact appears stronger among the group of USbased VCs that previously faced greater information asymmetries in valuing EU-based startups,

compared to local investors. We also find that the level of syndication decreases during this shift.
Importantly, the average amount invested per round does not change suggesting that the
information conferred by the EU-ODA replaced the need for peer evaluation. Exit performance
appears to improve with an increased probability of IPO and no greater risk of bankruptcy
resulting from the shift towards earlier stage investments. Taken together, our results appear to
demonstrate that regulation can play a significant role in mitigating valuation problems relating to
information asymmetry and, thus, helping drive private investment back across the ‘valley of
death’.
Our findings also have important policy implications given that many countries have
made establishing a solid ecosystem for entrepreneurship a priority. Unfortunately, for some
technologies and industries, such as biopharmaceuticals, significant information asymmetries
exist making the valuation of early-stage firms difficult. If these firms are unable to communicate
the genuine value of their early-stage innovations, they may end up being disproportionately
underfinanced compared to other startups for which information is more readily available and
discernable. This could dampen the incentives of entrepreneurs and early-stage firms to pursue
high-risk, high-reward type of innovations in important science-based sectors like
biopharmaceuticals. Our results here demonstrate that policy has a role in correcting this market
failure.
Our project, however, is not without limitations. First, we do not study systematically
how entry and exit of VCs might be driving our results, although we partly aim to address it
econometrically by using a fixed effects strategy. If it is the case that new VCs are responsible for
shifting the nature of VC activity towards early-stage startups, then future studies can build on
our intuition to investigate the moderating role of industry evolution among VCs in conjunction
with regulation, such as the EU-ODA. Second, as VCs shift their investment focus to early-stage
startups, they might need to come up with new investment strategies and/or governance structures
to manage their portfolio. While our study partly examines the changes in deal syndication

19

strategies of VCs, the shift towards less syndication in early-stages and more syndication in latestages may cause investment patterns, due to factors such as risk, to change. To the extent this has
unintended consequences remains to be seen.
Finally, while we do our best to tease out the causal impact of the EU-ODA, it is still
possible that the group of firms in drug-related biopharmaceutical fields may differ from the
group in non-drug-related fields in some unobservable ways. Future work could also consider
extending our findings to sectors beyond biopharmaceuticals to other emerging fields like
artificial intelligence or climate change. A cross-industry study would also be useful to help
determine if our results are generalizable or whether the biopharmaceutical industry remains a
‘black duck’. Related to this, it would be meaningful to examine what types of VC-specific
characteristics lead to the tendency toward financing younger innovations, such as the
background of partners, reputation or previous experiences in relevant markets. As always, much
remains to be done.

Table 3 results with multinomial logit models, taking into account that the dependent variable is
binary. Model (1) takes full samples to replicate Table 3 and Models (2), (3) and (4) replicate
Appendix Table 2, restricting sample periods to 3 years, 5 years, and 7 years before and after EUODA, respectively. Results are consistent. We also report here the coefficient estimates for our
full set of fixed effects at the technology category and year level. In addition this table reports
coefficient estimates for all our controls in the baseline specification. Standard errors are
clustered at the investing firm level. *p<0.10; **p<0.05; ***p<0.01

Appendix Table 5. Replication of Table 3 with Alternative Definitions of the Treatment
Group. We report here Table 3 results using alternative definitions of the treatment group. In
Panel 1, we include Biotech Research and Biotech Other in the treatment group instead of the
control group. In Panel 2, we switch Medical Diagnostics from the treatment group to the control
group. Results across all the robustness checks remain consistent. We also report here the
coefficient estimates for our full set of fixed effects at the technology category and year level. In
addition this table reports coefficient estimates for all our controls in the baseline specification.
Standard errors are clustered at the investing firm level. *p<0.10; **p<0.05; ***p<0.01

Appendix Table 9. Syndication of VC Investments with Alternative Time Periods Before
and After EU-ODA. This table replicates Model (2) and Model (3) of Table 6 by restricting the
sample to three different time periods in our analysis, 3, 5, and 7 years before and after EU-ODA.
Model (1) to Model (3) restrict samples to investments made in early round only and report the
Table 6 results with the alternative sample periods, while Model (4) to (6) repeat the process with
investments made in late rounds only. Results remain consistent. We also report here the
coefficient estimates for our full set of fixed effects at the technology category and year level. In
addition this table reports coefficient estimates for all our controls in the baseline specification.
Standard errors are clustered at the investing firm level. *p<0.10; **p<0.05; ***p<0.01.
