We show that, when current employers

have more information about worker quality than do potential employers,
sectoral shocks give rise to structural unemployment,

That is, some

workers laid off from the injured sector remain unemployed in
equilibrium despite the fact that they are of sufficient quality to be
productively employed somewhere in the economy at the prevailing wage.
The source

of'

this market failure is the inability of potential

of
employers to distinguish the abilities of workers within the pool
unemployed.

We also show that sectoral unemployment rates are not monotonic in
the severity of sectoral shocks.

increases

For small shocks, unemployment

in the injured sector and falls in the favored sector,

However, for larger shocks these relationships are reversed due to the
interaction of layoff and hiring decisions.

For larger shocks, firms in

declining sector layoff more, higher ability workers, which
increases the average ability of the pool of unemployed in that

The quality effect induces firms in the favored sector to hire

that pool more agesslvely, substituting

Finally, we show that equilibrium employment decisions are not

Our

labor market institutions imply that workers in each sector are

paid their opportunity wage, which is determined in part by the average
quality of the stock of workers laid off from that sector.

Layoffs are

greater in the injured sector, and since layoffs are ordered by quality,
the average quality of laid off workers in that sector is greater.
Thus, if demand for labor in the favored sector is sufficiently great,
the wage for workers in the injured sector can be higher.

The simple model we have developed can be extended

in several

directions, to which we believe these basic results are rcbust. We
mention here some of the potentially more interesting possibilities.

While toe

authors explore the intersectoral wage and mobility predictions of toe

such an economy responds to sectoral snocs as well.
A third period could also be added to our model,

This would

of firms
complicate the model considerably, since the retention decision
in period 2 would provide publicly available information about worker
quality in period

3.

However, as in Greenwald's model, the addition of

a third period is likely to intensify the problem of adverse selection
in this model, reducing further the level of intersectoral labor
mobility and, as such, exacebating the degree of structural
unemployment and pushing the economy further away from its constrained
Pareto optimum.
The role of contracts might also be considered.

Our analysis has

relied on the implicit assumption that employers cannot make credible
long—term commitments to workers.

However, allowing long—term bilateral

contracts between a firm and employees would not alter the information
asymmetry between sectors which is at the heart of our results,

In fact

contracts might further diminish intersectoral mobility due to tnsurance
provided to workers.

On the other hand, in a multiperlod extension of

our model, contracts might in some circumstances facilitate
intersectoral mobility by enabling workers of different abilities to
self—select.
Finally, we note that our analysis might have some implIcations
for empirical methodology.

For example, Lillien (1982) estimates a

3C
linear relationship between unemployment and a measure of seotoral
shifts. The implicit underlying hypotheses is that greater sectoral
shocks

result in

layoffs. However, our analysis suggests that
