ABSTRACT
Partitioning medical spending into conditions is essential to understanding the cost burden of
medical care. Two broad strategies have been used to measure disease-specific spending. The
first attributes each medical claim to the condition listed as its cause. The second decomposes
total spending for a person over a year to the cumulative set of conditions they have.
Traditionally, this has been done through regression analysis. This paper makes two
contributions. First, we develop a new method to attribute spending to conditions using
propensity score models. Second, we compare the claims attribution approach to the regression
approach and our propensity score stratification method in a common set of beneficiaries age 65
and over drawn from the 2009 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. Our estimates show that the
three methods have important differences in spending allocation and that the propensity score
model likely offers the best theoretical and empirical combination.

I. Introduction
For many purposes, it is important to attribute medical spending to particular conditions.
For example, researchers and policy makers often ask questions such as: Does spending align
with the burden of disease, or are the two independent? How much of medical spending growth
is associated with the rising prevalence of chronic disease? Each of these questions requires a
condition-based look at spending.

In this paper, we compare different methodologies for

attributing spending to medical conditions.
Cost of illness studies have a long tradition in health economics, dating back to the 1960s
(Scitovsky, 1967; Rice and Horowitz, 1967; Rice, 1967). The fundamental difficulty with
attributing spending to particular conditions is comorbidities. If all people had only one medical
condition at a time, it would be easy to measure condition-based spending. When people have
multiple conditions, however, this becomes more difficult. If a person has a heart attack from
which recovery is slow, is the extra spending during the post-acute period a result of an
abnormally slow recovery, or might it result instead from pre-existing mental illness, which
makes following a recommended medication and lifestyle pattern more difficult? One needs
some type of disease attribution methodology to answer this question.
Traditionally, studies in this literature assign each claim to one or more conditions (e.g.,
Cooper and Rice, 1976; Berk, Paringer and Mushkin, 1978; Koopmanschap, 1995; Hodgson and
Cohen, 1999; Leon and Neumann, 1999; Druss et al., 2001, 2002; Cohen and Krauss, 2003;
Thorpe et al., 2004a, 2004b, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2013; Roehrig et al., 2009, 2011; and Starr
et al., 2014). In the case of the heart attack example noted above, spending in the post-acute
period would be allocated to either cardiovascular disease or mental illness based on which
diagnosis the physician recorded as being the primary cause of the visit – or perhaps split
1

between multiple recorded diagnoses. The difficulty with this methodology is that physicians do
not necessarily solve the attribution question well. If the patient is re-hospitalized because
recovery from the heart attack is slow, the physician will (properly) record the new
hospitalization as caused by cardiovascular disease, even though that is just the symptom of
another problem.
Thus, there is a simultaneous history of researchers exploring other ways to measure cost
for medical conditions. Typically, regression analysis is used to relate annual spending at the
person level to a set of medical conditions that a person has in that calendar year (e.g., Dudley et
al.,1993;Koopmanshap, 1998; Bloom et al., 2001; Sturm, 2002; Finkelstein et al., 2003a, 2003b,
2009; Akobundu et al., 2006; Trogdon et al., 2008; Honeycutt et al., 2009, 2013; Rosen and
Cutler, 2009; Roberts et al. 2010; Gregori et al., 2011). The resulting coefficients are then used
to attribute spending to conditions.
Three issues come up in this type of analysis. First, most of the models for spending are
non-linear – often non-linear least squares or generalized linear models – and some method must
be used to attribute spending to conditions in a way that neither overcounts nor undercounts total
dollars. Trogdon et al. (2008) develop an attributable fraction methodology that does this, but it
can be very computationally intensive for models with many conditions.
Second, these regressions typically have a large unexplained component – the constant
term and other covariates. It is not clear what condition to assign that spending to. Third,
regression models make parametric assumptions, and the results can be sensitive to violation of
these assumptions. As is well known, the ordinary least squares(OLS) method is not well suited
to handle expenditure data with common data problems like heteroskedasticity, heavy tails, and

2

large outliers (Manning et al. 1998, 2001, 2005), Basu and Manning 2009; Jones, 2000;
Zaslavsky and Buntin, 2004; Cantoni and Ronchetti, 2006).
This paper has two goals. Our first goal is to develop a method of spending attribution to
conditions that is more robust than claims and regression methods. We propose a two-step
propensity score methodology to do this. The first step uses a propensity score method to
compare people with a condition to observably similar people without that condition. The
difference in spending between those individuals is an estimate of the condition-specific cost. In
the second step, we propose a non-additive framework that models total spending as a non-linear
function of attributed costs and a number of comorbidities. This allows us to incorporate the
overall number of comorbidities into the estimation of the disease-specific spending. This
method also attributes spending to all medical conditions without any residual.
We then compare three methods of allocating spending to conditions: a claims-attribution
approach along the lines of the earlier literature; a traditional regression specification; and the
propensity score methodology. The data that we use is the same for all three methods: the 2009
Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS).
The results show significant differences between the approaches. The claims approach
differs the most from the two other approaches in attributing more of the cost to acute medical
conditions (e.g., a heart attack) relative to the regression or propensity score methods, which
attribute more spending to comorbid conditions (e.g., mental illness, diabetes, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia). In contrast to the regression approach, the propensity score approach benefits
from not having a large unexplained component.
We also use a variety of statistical techniques to compare these models. In general, the
propensity score model does better at matching the distribution of individual-level spending than

3

does the regression or claims-based model. In addition, the propensity score model has a lower
out-of-sample mean squared error for predicted spending. For this reason, we believe that the
propensity score model is likely the best way to measure condition-specific medical spending.
The paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses the data we employ. The
third section presents the different methodologies for measuring condition-specific costs, using
our specific data to highlight the issues in each case. The fourth section shows the results
comparing spending using the different methodologies. The last section concludes.

II.

Data
Our primary data source is the 2009 Cost and Use sample of the Medicare Current

Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). 1 We restricted our sample to the population aged 65 and older
since the MCBS is nationally representative for the older population. Importantly, the MCBS
includes both community and institutionalized people. The MCBS has information on surveyreported events, supplemented by Medicare claims.
To define conditions, we started with the 259 Clinical Classification Software categories
delineated by the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality. Not all of these conditions have
a high prevalence in the elderly, and some combine categories that might usefully be
disaggregated for this group. After combining and disaggregating, we determined ex-ante a set
of 105 conditions: 98 diagnosed conditions; 3 undiagnosed conditions (high cholesterol, high
blood pressure, and diabetes), and 4 cancer screening variables (colon cancer, cervical cancer,
breast cancer and prostate cancer).

1

The MCBS has two samples: a set of people who were enrolled for the entire year (the Access to Care sample) and
a set of ever-enrolled beneficiaries (the Cost and Use sample). The latter differs from the former in including people
who die during the year and new additions to the Medicare population. The Cost and Use sample adds up to
national spending totals, so we use those data.

4

In any clinical taxonomy, there is always a residual category of conditions that are
difficult to disaggregate. We defined a category of “other conditions” that includes signs and
symptoms (for example, routine general medical examination at health care facility), residual
conditions and unclassified conditions (for example, recurrent hypersomnia), and some E codes
such as accidents).
In a preliminary analysis, several of the calibrated conditions had too low a prevalence to
meaningfully estimate their cost in the elderly. Thus, for the purpose of cost estimation, we
combined these 105 conditions into 78 conditions with a larger sample size. The appendix
reports the prevalence of each condition (Raghunathan T, et al., 2017).
While MCBS has many strengths, it also has some limitations, for which we developed
solutions. We sketch the issues and solutions here and provide more detail in the Appendix.
First, MCBS has incomplete or no claims information for beneficiaries enrolled in Health
Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). We reweighted the fee-for-service population to
compensate for this exclusion, matching HMO enrollees to comparable fee-for-service
beneficiaries. Second, we made an adjustment for the difference between survey spending and
national spending estimates, along with the lines of Selden et al. (2001) and Sing et al. (2006).
We began by removing expenditures from the NHEA for goods and services which were out of
the scope of the survey data. We then reallocated spending across service categories so that total
spending across service categories would match.

To ensure that the reallocated spending

matched national totals, we proportionately increased spending in each category so that total
survey spending equaled the NHEA estimate of spending for the elderly. The aggregate
adjustment was to increase survey spending by 11%, roughly evenly spread across service
categories (Rosen A, et al., 2017).

5

Finally, the disease prevalence rates reported in MCBS for some conditions (for example,
hypertension and hyperlipidemia) are lower than those observed in surveys such as the National
Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES), which collects laboratory results. We
used the NHANES to calibrate the prevalence of conditions in MCBS to more accurately reflect
national levels. We term the resulting condition list the “calibrated medical conditions.” The
imputation procedure produced five imputed data sets. In our empirical analysis, we estimated
the models for each of the five imputed data sets. We used proc mianalyze in SAS 9.4 to
combine means and standard errors from the five imputed data sets using standard combination
rules (Little and Rubin, 1987; Li, Raghunathan and Rubin,1991).
The distribution of per-person spending for the resulting data set is shown in the first part
of figure 1 and the first row of table 1. Mean per capita spending on medical care for the elderly
was $17,479 in 2009. The median is much lower: $7,281; as is well known, there is a long right
tail in spending, which can be seen in figure 1 and in the last two columns of table 1.

III.

Methods for Attributing Spending to Conditions
There are two fundamental methodologies in the literature for attributing spending to

conditions: a claims-based method that assigns spending for particular claims to one or more
conditions coded as the reason for the medical visit, and a regression method that uses total
spending over a period of time and a set of medical conditions to decompose spending into
attributable conditions. We discuss each method in turn, highlighting how we implement each.
Before we present our methodologies, we note one feature of the analysis. We seek to
estimate the partial effect of each condition on spending, controlling for all other conditions that
a person has. That differs from the total effect that spending on a disease might lead to,

6

including its effects on the prevalence of other conditions.

As an example, suppose that

physicians treat hypertension more aggressively than in the past. That will raise spending on
hypertension. But it might lower overall spending if there are offsets in fewer heart attacks or
strokes. Our estimates will give us the additional spending on hypertension since we hold
constant the other cardiovascular conditions a person has. To estimate the total cost impact of
spending more on any condition, we would need a set of equations for how each condition
affects the incidence of others. We do not explore these inter-linkages in this paper.

A. CLAIMS-BASED METHOD
In the claims-based method, claims for which there is only one diagnosis are easy to
assign to a disease. However, most medical claims have more than one condition associated
with them. A typical claim in Medicare data contains a principal diagnosis code (ICD9-CM) and
several other secondary diagnoses codes (sometimes up to 14). For example, a patient
hospitalized for a heart attack will likely also be diagnosed with other comorbid conditions, such
as congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia. The question to
address is how to estimate the amount spent on treating each of the conditions.
In the first claims-based studies, developed in the 1960s, spending for each claim was
allocated to the principal diagnosis. Using data from the 1960s, Rice (1967) estimated that the
most costly conditions were diseases of the digestive system; mental, psychoneurotic and
personality disorders; and diseases of the circulatory system. The most recent work following
the claim-attribution methodology is by Thorpe et al. (2004a, 2004b, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2010,
and 2013) and Roehrig et al. (2009, 2011) and uses data from the Medical Expenditure Panel
Survey over the 1990s and 2000s. To address the problem of multiple conditions, Thorpe et al.

7

(2004a) estimate an “upper bound” (attributing total spending for each health care event to all the
conditions reported), a “lower bound” (summing spending from each medical event for which
only a single condition is reported) and a “best guess”, where claims with more than one listed
condition are divided using the relative spending of each condition in the single condition claims.
Using the 259 disease classifications in the Clinical Classification System (CCS) (Elixhauser,
Steiner, and Palmer, 2014) to define conditions, Thorpe et al. (2004a) estimate that the
conditions accounting for the most spending are heart disease, pulmonary disease, and mental
disorders. The finding that heart disease is the most costly condition has been mirrored in other
recent studies (Roehrig et al., 2009).
Our version of the claims-based attribution method follows Thorpe’s best guess, making
adjustments as appropriate. To start, we note that this method is based on the observed claims
for each person, not the calibrated claims that we derived– except as noted below. In each set of
MCBS claims files (hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, carrier, hospice, home health, skilled
nursing facility and durable medical equipment), we first identified claims with only one listed
condition. Table A6 in the Appendix gives detail as to whether each medical condition has
claims that satisfy the “single condition claim” criteria. Out of the seven different types of
claims, only carrier/physician and hospital outpatient claims have “single condition claims” –
that is, a claim with single diagnosis code listed in it – for all 98 medical conditions (excluding
the 3 undiagnosed conditions) and 4 cancer screening variables. In these data files, we estimated
the average cost for single claims for all 98 medical conditions and 4 screening variables.
We used this information to apportion a cost to medical conditions for multiple condition
claims in these two files. For example, if the average cost of condition ‘a’ in the single condition
claims file is ca, and the average cost of condition ‘b’ in the single condition claims file is cb, a

8

claim that listed both conditions ‘a’ and ‘b’ would be allocated ca/(ca+cb) to condition ‘a’, and
cb/(ca+cb) to condition ‘b’.
Unfortunately, the “single-condition claim” criterion fails for inpatient, skilled nursing
facility, home health, durable medical equipment, and hospice claims. In the inpatient file, only
13 (e.g., breast cancer, prostate cancer) out of 102 medical conditions (excluding 3 undiagnosed
conditions) satisfy the “single condition claim” criteria. In skilled nursing facility file, only 36
(e.g., tuberculosis, HIV) out of 102 medical conditions satisfy the “single condition claim”
criteria. In the home health, hospice, and durable medical equipment files, 20, 40 and 59
conditions respectively satisfy the “single condition claim” criteria. This is one of the biggest
limitations of claims-based approach.
To proceed, we used a methodology somewhat akin to the multiple condition
methodology presented above. We began with a sample of Medicare inpatient claims and
assigned each claim to one of the 78 conditions discussed above based on the principal diagnosis
of the claim. For each condition, we then averaged the DRG (diagnosis-related group) weight
for all of the associated claims. This gave us a rough measure of severity for the condition. We
used these relative severity weights to apportion the original claims to the multiple listed
diagnoses. For example, suppose there was a claim for $500 in the inpatient hospital file and
two conditions listed are diabetes and hypertension. Suppose further that in the full set of claims
for which diabetes was the principal diagnosis, the average DRG weight was 1.52, and in the set
of claims for which hypertension is the principal diagnosis, the average severity weight is 0.71.
We would assign 1.52/(1.52+0.71)*$500 to diabetes and 0.71/(1.52+0.71)*$500 to hypertension.
The prescription drug data in MCBS have no diagnosis codes listed. Therefore, we
identified all medical conditions the person was treated for in 2009 using the diagnosis codes

9

listed in their claims: inpatient, outpatient, skilled nursing facility, carrier, hospice, home health
and durable medical equipment. Each condition was counted once and assigned a DRG weight
based on inpatient admissions with that condition, as above. We then apportioned total
prescription drug spending for the year based on the share of these DRG weights to each
condition.
Finally, for 5.3% of beneficiaries there were dollar amounts in the personal summary
file(s), but no claims.2 For these beneficiaries, we used the calibrated claims that we derived
using the NHANES instead of actual claims and assigned dollars to calibrated medical
conditions on that basis. The result of this process was a complete decomposition of medical
spending into 74 medical conditions and 4 cancer screening variables.
Table 2 reports the total attributed spending by multi-level clinical classification system
(CCS) categories, and table A9 in the appendix reports spending for each of the 78 medical
conditions. Diseases of the circulatory system were the most expensive category, costing $148.1
billion and accounting for 23 percent of all personal health care expenditure. Diseases of the
nervous system and sense organs cost $64 billion, accounting for 10 percent of aggregate
personal health care. The next three most costly disease categories were diseases of the
musculoskeletal system and connective tissue ($62.2 billion, 10 percent); diseases of the
respiratory system ($53.4 billion, 8 percent); and endocrine; nutritional; and metabolic diseases
and immunity disorders ($49.2 billion, 8 percent). Together, these five disease groups accounted
for almost 59% of all personal health care spending. At the level of specific conditions, the most
expensive conditions were acute events with expensive and often prolonged hospitalizations:

2

Person Summary or Service Summary files are created from the event-level files. The event-level files include selfreported events, some of which are not paid under Medicare FFS, so there will be no corresponding claims.

10

acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, hematologic cancers, lung cancer, and acute renal
failure.
One way to understand these results is to take the disease-specific spending and add it up
to the individual level, using the conditions diagnosed for each patient. The result is predicted
spending at the individual level, which can be compared to observed spending in the population.
Figure 1 and table 1 report the distribution of the person-level expenditures from the claims
model. By construction, mean person-level spending is the same as in the observed data. Median
spending is significantly higher with the claims-based attribution: $15,006, compared to $7,281
in the observed data. Effectively, the cost of high spending outliers is attributed to some
diseases, and these diseases are distributed throughout the population. Thus, the median
individual is estimated to be spending more than is true in practice whereas the high end spends
less. This is true to some extent for all of the methods we examine.
For people with no claims, spending is zero; figure 1 shows that the claims-based method
effectively reproduces the share of people with zero spending.

B. REGRESSION APPROACH
The second method of attributing spending to medical conditions is to use regression
analysis. Conceptually, the regression model relates total spending over the year to the full set of
conditions that a person has. The coefficients can then be used to find spending for each
condition. A typical equation is of the form:
log(

+ 1) =

+

+

A good deal of work has considered how to model medical spending. Issues such as the
non-normal distribution of spending and heteroscedasticity are clearly important (Duan et al.

11

1983; Manning 1998; Jones, 2000; Manning et al., 2001, 2005; Zaslavsky and Buntin, 2004;
Basu and Manning, 2009). The most common solutions to heavy tails are: (1) transformation to
deal with skewness (e.g., ordinary least square on ln(spending+1)) and use of smearing factors
for retransformation; and (2) different weighting approaches based on exponential conditional
model (ECM) and generalized linear model (GLM) approaches.
Following Manning and Mullahy (2001), we explored several GLM estimation
techniques. First, (1) we fit models that are variants of generalized linear models (GLM) for
spending with a Gamma distribution and log link function. We also tried (2) a GLM model with
log(y+1) as the dependent variable with a Gaussian distribution and identity link. Other models
included (3) a cubic root model (cubic root of cost) and (4) a Box-Cox model.
Some studies make an additional adjustment for people with no medical spending, for
example using a two-part model (Duan 1984, Mihaylova et al., 2011, Belotti et al., 2015): one
equation for the probability of positive spending and the second for the amount spent. We
estimate two-part models assuming the probability that a beneficiary has positive health care
spending is a probit. For people with non-zero spending, an OLS or GLM regression is run with
the same set of covariates as in the probit model (Belotti et al., 2015).
We tried several two-part models with the following specifications: (5) generalized
linear models (GLM) for spending with a Gamma distribution and log link function; (6)
log(spending) as the dependent variable with a Gaussian distribution and identity link, and
finally (7) a cubic root model (cubic root of cost). We could not estimate the two-part Box-Cox
model as the STATA software used in the estimation does not support Box-Cox (Belotti et al.,
2015). In our data, only 2% of the sample has no spending in the year. This is not surprising

12

given the age of the population and its enrolment in Medicare. For this reason, we believe that
the two-part models do not offer a huge improvement over one-part models.
A third concern that arises in the regression model is that conditions can be associated
with decreased spending – that is, there is no constraint that the coefficients on the conditions are
all positive. Generally, negative coefficients are ascribed to diagnostic mismeasurement (Hall
and Highfill, 2013a, 2013b). When relatively healthy people see physicians, physicians still
need some condition to code as the cause of the visit. In such circumstances, the physician may
code a relatively benign condition (hypertension or high cholesterol, for example) that is
common in the population and straightforward to justify.

For patients with a variety of

conditions, in contrast, physicians may focus on more acute conditions and not record risk
factors that have little immediate impact on health. Effectively, this will lead to lower spending
on less acute conditions than would be true in practice.
Some studies address this concern by forcing the coefficients to be positive.

For

example, one could model spending as:
log(

+ 1) =

+

exp( ) +

In this equation, the coefficient on spending (exp(β)) can never be negative.

In practice,

however, this equation does not always converge; the β’s approach -∞, effectively wanting some
conditions to not affect spending. Other studies address the issue by defining hierarchical
categories to pull out difficult cases. For example, rather than coding for hypertension, the
regression might include categories for ‘hypertension without other conditions’, ‘hypertension
with heart disease’, and so on (Pope et al., 2004). Conditions are often defined so that spending
on every condition is positive. For our purposes, we do not wish to change the set of conditions

13

across estimation methodologies. Thus, we let negative coefficients be negative and proceed as
if that is the true impact of the condition.
To implement the regression models, we include as independent variables the 78
calibrated condition and screening indicators and other covariates that are expected to influence
medical costs. These include: health status compared to one year ago (somewhat better/much
better, about the same, somewhat worse/much worse); general health compared to others same
age (excellent, very good, good, fair, poor); death in calendar year, any difficulty lifting/carrying
10 pounds; any difficulty in stooping/crouching/kneeling; any difficulty walking 1/4 mi. or 2-3
blocks; any difficulty dressing; any difficulty eating; private health insurance coverage for the
calendar year; days in institution; count of inpatient nights; count of inpatient stays; current
smoker; body mass image; age dummies; education dummies (<9 years, 9-11 grade (including 12
with no diploma); high school grad/GED or equivalent, some college or AA degree; college
grad); ever served in armed forces; sex; marital status (married, widowed, divorced, separated,
never married); poverty category (poor, near poor, low income, middle income, high income);
race and ethnicity dummies (white, black, other; Hispanic ethnicity).
As noted in section 1, to form an accurate diagnosis profile for each individual, we
imputed prevalence of diseases from NHANES using multiple imputations. This produces 5
imputed datasets, denoted Dm, for m=1,…,5. We then estimate five regressions, of the form:
log(

+ 1) =

+

+

where the regression is estimated using HMO-adjusted survey weights. We combine these
estimates and calculate appropriate standard errors using standard techniques (Little and Rubin,
1987; Li, Raghunathan and Rubin,1991). Table A7 in the appendix shows the coefficient
estimates from all five imputed data sets using the one-part model with the Gaussian distribution

14

and identity link. Although they are not the primary object of our analysis, we remark briefly on
the estimates for the demographic characteristics. Generally, these are as expected. People who
die spend more, as do people who have difficulties with ADLs or IADLs. Among the more
surprising findings are that men spend less than women (conditional on their health conditions
and health status), as do smokers. Importantly, these covariates suggest that there is more to
spending than just the clinical factors.
From our estimates in appendix table A7, two of the condition groups have negative
coefficients for all five of the replicates: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Acute Renal Failure.
These are relatively less common (6% and 9% respectively), but the claims-based approach
attributed $2.2 billion and $7.7 billion to them respectively. We set spending to zero for those
two conditions (as in Hall and Highfill, 2013a, 2013b). In some cases, coefficients were negative
for only a selection of the five multiples. In this case, we treated those variables as missing and
averaged the coefficients over the remaining replicates.
We did an extensive diagnosis of the residuals from all of the models to choose the most
appropriate regression specification, shown in figures A3-A6 in the appendix. Figure A3 shows
the kernel density plot comparison of the residuals (in blue) along with the normal density (in
red). Figure A4 shows the standardized normal probability plots of the residuals. Figure A5
shows the quantile of residuals relative to the normal distribution. Figure A6 shows the scatter
plot of the residuals relative to per person spending.
All of these residual plots use the in-sample estimates. An alternative way to measure fit
is to use out-of-sample predictions. Table 3 shows the root mean square error (RMSE) based on
out-of-sample predictions; we estimate the model in a random half of the data (N=3,100) and
predict spending in the other half.

15

The out-of-sample predictions show that the one-part model with log(spending+1) as the
dependent variable and with a Gaussian distribution and identity link had the lowest RMSE.
Figure A3 shows that this model also fit well. The one and two part cubic-roots were second
best. Surprisingly, the Gamma models with log link performed relatively poorly. These models
are sensitive to high-spenders with big residuals – as typified by people in nursing homes.
The log specification implicitly assumes that each disease has a multiplicative effect on
spending. An additional transformation is needed to turn this into dollars, and to ensure that the
average dollars spent will match the known total. We follow a methodology described by
Trogdon et al. (2007, 2008) which estimates expenditures associated with co-occurring diseases
and reallocates these expenditures to individual diseases. For notational simplicity, we omit the
m superscript denoting each multiply imputed dataset. In practice, we estimate the equations
below for each data set and then average the estimates as noted above. We start by calculating
the fraction of spending attributable to all of the individual’s illnesses (

$ %∙ $'(
(

$ %∙ $'()

)∙ $'

):

)
where *+ = , ∑,/) exp( ̂ ) is a smearing factor to estimate the average error term. Then, we

calculate the share * 0 % of spending by each individual that can be attributed to each diagnosed
condition:
*1 =

2exp +0 % − 14 ∙ 0
∑70/)52exp +0 % − 14 ∙

We then disaggregate the observed cost at the individual level by taking the product of the
attributable fraction, the spending share for that condition, and the observed cost per person:

The second column of table 2 shows spending by multi-level CCS category, and table A9
in the appendix shows the spending attributed to each of the 78 medical conditions. The
regression estimates differ in many ways from the claims-based estimates. “Other conditions”
are much more important in the regression approach, accounting for 19 percent of spending
compared to 6 percent in the claims approach. Indeed, other spending is the leading cause of
spending in the regression approach. Subsequent analysis suggests that this is largely due to high
attributed spending for signs and symptoms. Circulatory disease is second in spending (19
percent).
The third most expensive condition is not an actual condition; it is the unexplained
component – the constant term and other covariates. This picks up spending that the regression
does not attribute to any condition. Unfortunately for the regression approach, this is very large
– $58 billion, or 9 percent of total spending. The importance of this unattributed spending is one
argument against the regression approach.
Endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases and immunity disorders (8 percent) and
diseases of the nervous system and sense organs (7 percent) round out the top five. We present
more comparison below of how the regression and claims-based approaches estimate diseasespecific spending.

17

To evaluate the distribution of individual spending resulting from this set of average
costs, we calculated the predicted spending for each person as the sum of averages cost for each
(9)
(9)
of the diagnosed conditions: DE = ∑0 80

0.

Figure 1 and table 1 report distribution of the estimates from the regression-based model.
The regression approach has less variability in predicted spending than the claims-based (and
propensity score) approaches.

Effectively, the regression approach has a difficult time

determining the cost of different conditions (as typified by the unexplained component), and thus
finds less variation in predicted spending across individuals. A related byproduct of this is that
the regression approach greatly understates the share of people with zero and very low spending.
Figure 1 shows essentially no mass at very low spending with the regression approach.

C. PROPENSITY SCORE METHOD
Our proposed propensity score methodology consists of two steps: first, estimating the
average difference in spending for individuals with and without each disease and second,
incorporating the number of conditions and other measures of the amount of health care received
to refine the estimates of cost attributed to each condition. We repeated each step using each
multiply imputed dataset and average them as above. For notational ease, we omitted the m
superscript in our presentation.
To estimate the average difference in spending 80 for individuals with and without the
condition of interest Dj, we began by estimating the probability of having condition Dj,
conditional on the available covariates and all other conditions; this estimated probability is
known as the propensity score. We computed the propensity score by fitting separate logistic
regression models for each condition, where Dj is the outcome. The covariates used in the
18

propensity score models were the same as the covariates used in the regression approach. For
each propensity score model, we normally included the other 77 calibrated health conditions as a
part of the X vector, but excluded conditions that had a deterministic or extremely tight
correlation with the condition of the interest. For example, in estimating the propensity of
hypertension, we did not condition on undiagnosed hypertension (the two are mutually
exclusive). Similarly, in estimating the probability of mammogram screening, we did not
condition on breast cancer (all people with breast cancer have mammograms).

Also, the

propensity of gender-specific diseases such as breast and prostate cancer were estimated only for
the relevant gender. We estimated the probability of death in a given year and then used the
estimated probability of death as a covariate in the propensity score models for the 78 calibrated
health conditions. We could not directly include death (as a binary variable) in the propensity
score models, as there was small fraction of decedents (roughly 5%) in any calendar year, and
including it in the logistic regression models with certain rare conditions as the outcome led to
separation of cases and controls, causing convergence issues with the model estimates. We did
not use spending as a covariate in any of our propensity score models.
After computing the propensity scores for a disease category, subjects were grouped into
five homogeneous strata based on their propensity scores, using the quintiles of the propensity
score as cutoffs to determine groups. We then estimated the mean difference in expenditures
between cases and controls within each stratum, by simply taking the difference in average costs
between those with and without condition Dj within each stratum. Finally, we combined the
estimated difference in expenditures within each strata, weighting by the population size in each
stratum, to obtain an estimate of healthcare expenditure attributable for that disease category.
Using the propensity score to divide subjects into strata or subclasses, as described by

19

Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983), we could directly compare medical expenditures for individuals
with Dj and those without Dj within groups containing same covariate profiles, enabling us to
adjust for comorbidities and other covariates. Creating five strata using propensity score was
shown to be an effective method for applying causal inference to observational studies, removing
around 90% of the bias in the difference between the cases and controls caused by covariate
imbalance (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1984). Thus, our estimates are for expenditures attributable
to each condition, adjusted for all other conditions. This process of stratification and estimating
the attributable spending was done separately for each of the 78 conditions.
We performed the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test to assess our logistic
regression models used in computing the propensity scores (Hosmer and Lemeshow 2000).
Furthermore, we compared the distribution of covariates for those with the condition and those
without within each propensity score stratum in order to ensure a balance of covariates within
each stratum. We found good overlap in the covariate profiles between cases and controls to
allow us to properly estimate the attributable costs for each condition.
From our propensity score models, we obtained estimates for the average difference in
spending among individuals with and without each condition of interest; however, these
estimates ignore several factors such as the number of diseases, severity, the number of days of
hospitalization, etc. that can affect the actual cost for each individual. The adjustment model
aims to model the observed cost as a function of the naïve cost (the sum of the costs of all the
conditions as estimated in the first step) and other factors: the number of health conditions,
history of hospitalization, institutionalization and death.
First, we compared actual medical expenditures at the individual level reported in the
survey with predicted medical costs for each individual based our model estimates, obtained by

20

summing the relevant 80 estimates for each subject. When examining the difference between
observed and estimated costs, relationships became apparent between this difference and several
variables, such as the number of health conditions, history of hospitalization and
institutionalization, and death.

The relationships can be seen by plotting the error term,

measured as a difference between naïve predicted cost and true cost, against the aforementioned
covariates, all of which are proxies for the volume or intensity of care. Figure A7 in the
Appendix shows the different plots. Empirically, the difference is related to these characteristics.
For example, the institutionalized population spends even more than predicted given its medical
history.
We developed an adjustment model that predicts subject-specific observed cost as a
product of the sum of the disease costs, 80 , and a polynomial dependent on the number of the
health conditions, history of hospitalization, institutionalization, and death within a given year:
F(D ) = 8 G( 80
0

0 ),

where Dij is an indicator of disease j for subject i, and Ci is a polynomial
8 =

H

+ ∑I/)(J

I

KI ,

where K1,...K9 are variables corresponding to the number of comorbidities, that number squared,
an indicator for any hospitalization, number of nights in the hospital, number of hospital
admissions, number of days institutionalized, survival in the indicated year, number of months
survived for those who are deceased, and number of outpatient claims. Although we adjusted for
death in given year in our propensity models, it was through estimating the probability of death,
not directly conditioning on the indicator for death.

Several of the other variables in the

adjustment model were not included in the propensity score model due to either rarity or high

21

correlation with calibrated conditions, which could lead to issues in fitting the logistic regression
model.
When fitting our model, we constrained the adjustment factors 80 % so that the weighted
sum of predicted cost matched the weighted sum of observed cost. To do this we first fit the
model for 80 with no constraints and obtained estimates for
intercept,

H,

H ,…

J.

We then adjusted the

by adding a term so that
G D = G 8 G 80
0

0

This model yielded subject-specific adjustment factors 8 % that incorporated covariates related
to the volume of medical care received. Constraining 80 ensured that the average predicted cost
from our model would be equal to the observed costs, guarantying that predicted spending would
match total spending in the population. Parameter estimates for the adjustment are displayed in
table A8.
To integrate these adjustments to the estimated cost of specific health conditions, we first
aggregated the adjustment factors 8 for each disease j by taking the average of the individuals
with the condition j:
L0 =

∑ 8
∑

0
0

Then, we applied this disease-specific adjustment factor L0 to the average difference in spending
for individuals with and without the condition of interest, by taking the product of
80 % and L0 :

(PQ0)

80

= 80 L0 . The results are estimates of spending at the condition

level that are guaranteed to sum to total spending and that track the individual distributions of
spending as well as possible. As above, we averaged across 5 multiple imputed data sets using
22

proc mianalyze in SAS 9.4. After fitting the adjusted model, we examined plots of the residuals
on the variables in the adjustment model to check that we correctly modeled the relationship
between cost and the number of health conditions, history of hospitalization and
institutionalization, and death.
Table 2 reports the total attributed spending by multi-level CCS categories, and table A9
shows the specific conditions. Diseases of the circulatory system were the most expensive
category, costing $144.8 billion and accounting for 23 percent of personal health spending. The
next most expensive categories were “other conditions” (13 percent), diseases of the respiratory
system (10 percent), endocrine, nutritional; and metabolic diseases and immunity disorders (8
percent), and diseases of the nervous system and sense organs (7 percent). Together, these six
disease groups accounted for almost 61% of personal health spending. Two of the conditions
(cancer screening; complications of pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium) are estimated to
have negative spending. We remark on this below.
Figure 1 and table 1 report distributions of the estimates from the propensity score model.
The propensity score approach shows a broader range of spending than the regression approach
but not as broad as the claims-based approach. Effectively, our second stage makes spending at
the individual level more dispersed than with the regression but does not allow as many very low
and high spenders as with the claims.

IV.

Comparison of Cost Attribution Results
The previous section showed that spending for different conditions differs across the

methods. We start by showing more detail about these differences. Figure 2 shows two-way
scatter plots of average attributed cost for the claims-based, regression-based, and propensity

23

score approaches. Panel A compares the claims-attribution approach and the regression-based
approach. Panel B compares the claims attribution and propensity score approaches, and panel C
compares the regression and propensity score methods.
The correlation between average disease-specific spending using the different approaches
is reasonably high: 0.27 between the claims-based approach and the regression approach, 0.71
between the claim-based approach and propensity score approach, and 0.56 between the
regression approach and the propensity score approach. The figures show that some large and
significant outliers influence the correlations.
The average attributed cost from the claims-based method is higher for most of the
conditions than for the other two approaches. This is not surprising; the claims approach
estimates cost of the condition that resulted in the claim, whereas the propensity score and
regression methods estimate cost attributed to the condition regardless of whether it was
specified in the claim or remained latent. For example, the cost of a stroke that has a claim in a
given year is likely to be higher than a past stroke whose residual effects are still present. A
corollary of this is that the effective number of conditions for each claim is higher in the
regression and propensity score approaches.
In general, acute medical conditions like acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cardiac
arrest, hematologic cancer, and hip fracture have significantly higher average costs in the claimsbased method than in the regression and propensity score methods.
Not surprisingly, the average attributed cost from the regression method and the
propensity score method have much greater accord than either one has with the claim-based
approach. Most of the conditions are around the 45-degree line, with few exceptions that are offdiagonal. The major differences are that conditions like lung cancer, hematologic cancer, and

24

schizophrenia have much higher average attributed cost in the propensity score method as
compared to the regression-based method. On the other hand, hypertension and signs and
symptoms have significantly higher attributed costs in the regression-based approach.
Intuition suggests that expensive, rare diseases are likely to generate high spenders. The
regression method, by assuming parametric models and distributions, may smooth over these
extreme values, whereas the non-parametric propensity score approach gives higher weight to
these outliers. On the other hand, attributed cost estimation for very prevalent and less severe
conditions such as hypertension and signs and symptoms may be influenced by collinearity with
other conditions, which could be more of an issue for the regression approach.
In addition to average spending per condition, we also care about total spending on each
condition – taking into account prevalence as well as cost per condition. Figure 3 shows the
scatter plot of total attributed spending between the three approaches. To a great extent, the
results in figure 3 mirror those in figure 2. The biggest outliers in the total spending figure are
hypertension and signs and symptoms. The regression approach estimates the highest spending
on these conditions, followed by the propensity score approach and then the claims-based
approach. It is natural that hypertension is attributed fewer dollars by claims than by overall
spending impact.
Figure 4 shows the ratio of total costs for the propensity score method to the claimsattribution method, using the total dollars displayed in Table 1. A ratio >1 implies that the
propensity score method attributes more spending than claims, and a ratio <1 implies the
opposite. Among the major identified diseases that are consistent with the ICD9-CM disease
chapters, the biggest ratios (>1) are for diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs (largely
anemia), injury and poisoning, and mental illness. Some of these are important comorbid

25

conditions. Anemia can generally be treated cheaply, but its presence indicates a more severe
form of the disease. Thus, it is natural that people with anemia spend a lot more than people
without. Similarly, mental illness has been shown in many studies to be a significant risk factor
for spending (Finkelstein, 2003b). People who are mentally ill spend more for all comorbid
conditions, even acute ones, than those without mental illness.
A flip occurs at diseases of circulatory system, where the claims approach attributes more
dollars than the propensity score approach. Two ratios are negative for the conditions (cancer
screening; and complications of menopause, pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium) because
the PSM method attributed negative spending to those conditions whereas the claims approach
attributed positive spending. In the elderly population, complications of menopause, pregnancy,
childbirth, and the puerperium largely reflects menopause. Women coded for this may be
relatively healthy – if there were other, more severe conditions, they would likely be coded.
Screening may be negative for the same reason (because healthier people get screened) or
because screening prevents more expensive diseases.
Using all three metrics, disease specific spending in the elderly population is very
skewed. In the claims-based approach, the top 5 (10) conditions account for 20% (36%) of total
dollars.

The shares are 45% (61%) for the regression approach and 29% (46%) for the

propensity score model.
Table A9 in the appendix shows the average and total cost associated with each condition
using the propensity score method, alongside the other methods. The most expensive conditions
in table A9 generally cost about $3,000 to $4,000 annually. For example, the cost of lung cancer
ranges from $2,800 to $4,400. This is true using all methods and seems unusual given ex-ante
expectations. For example, the cost of almost any chemotherapy regimen will exceed the few

26

thousand dollars that we estimate cancer to cost. The issue here is that not all of the prevalent
cases are incident cases. Imagine that a person was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2008, receives
the bulk of their care in that year and has a few visits for monitoring in 2009. We will record
that person as (correctly) having lung cancer in 2009, even though the case is not new. Further,
lung cancer spending will be relatively low in 2009 unless the person has a cancer recurrence.
The net effect will be relatively low average spending per case.
If one were developing a model of lung cancer cost effectiveness, the spending we
estimate would be of limited use. For such a model, one would want to know spending by the
phase of cancer: the acute phase, maintenance phase, and (possibly) terminal phase. In studying
the decomposition of total spending into conditions, however, the estimate we have is very
relevant: it correctly indicates the average amount spent per person treated with cancer in the
given year for a representative cross-section of the population, as well as the total dollars in the
population.

V.

Discussion
Our results show many similarities, but also important differences across the alternate

methods of assigning costs to medical conditions. The obvious question to ask is, which one is
best? There is no gold standard against which to compare the estimates from the different
methods. Thus, we cannot give a definitive answer to the question. Still, some observations are
possible.
Statistically, one way to evaluate the models is by comparing in-sample predicted and
actual spending at the individual level. The root of the mean squared difference between actual
and predicted spending across individuals is $2,679 for the claims-based method, $3,032 for the

27

regression-based method and $2,723 for the propensity score method. We also assessed the
correlation between observed and predicted costs using each of the three methods. The
correlation for the claims method is 0.63; the correlation for the regression approach is 0.61, and
the correlation for the propensity score approach is 0.63.
Out-of-sample prediction is generally more informative than in-sample prediction, since
allowing more degrees of freedom inherently reduces in-sample discrepancies between actual
and predicted spending. In out-of-sample prediction, by contrast, allowing more degrees of
freedom may overfit the data. To form out-of-sample estimates, we divided the data into two
random sub-samples: one half for model-fitting and one half for prediction. We use the same
observations for fitting and prediction in each of the models so that the difference results only
from the ability to fit the underlying data. Table 3 shows the out-of-sample root mean square
errors (RMSEs) for the various methods. The propensity score approach has the lowest RMSE,
followed by the best regression model and last the claims-based model.
The ability to implement the models is also important.

On this count, the claims-

attribution methodology suffers from several problems. First, it is difficult to implement the
methodology in a consistent manner. Because in most claims – especially the most expensive
ones – involve more than one condition, the claims-based methodology will depend on the
method used to parcel out costs into conditions. In our sample, 99.5% of dollars involve claims
having multiple conditions listed, and 98.4% of beneficiaries have multiple conditions. This
makes the claims-based estimation method extremely challenging. We made assumptions about
how to divide claims into component conditions, but the assumptions do not have a strong
theoretical rationale.

28

In Thorpe et al.’s (2004a) analysis, there was little difference between the claimsattribution model done different ways. However, Thorpe was using MEPS data for his analysis,
and utilization events in MEPS are reported by individuals, rather than providers.

Thus,

underreporting of less severe conditions is more likely. Further, Thorpe et al. (2004a) were
looking at the entire population rather than just the elderly; there is a much greater incidence of
comorbidity in the elderly than in the non-elderly population.
Further, the claims-attribution methodology has difficulty with comorbid conditions that
are not central to the primary reason for health care utilization. Relative to the regression and
propensity score approaches, the claims-attribution methodology is low for anemia and mental
illness, each of which is likely to increase medical spending across-the-board.
The regression and propensity score methods have a lot in common. Both methods
facilitate cost attribution to any condition of interest: claim-based, calibrated health condition,
self-report, or behavioral risk factors such as smoking. In addition, both methods are designed to
adjust for other diseases and demographic covariates.

The regression method is easier to

implement because it does not require a new model for each health condition. If the data fits the
parametric assumptions well and the set of health conditions is not highly correlated, then it
produces unbiased and efficient estimates of the attributed costs.
However regression-based cost estimation has several limitations. First, it makes several
parametric assumptions, which may not be satisfied. Second, there is a large residual spending
amount that cannot be attributed to any disease. Third, some coefficients are estimated to be
negative, and the approach we follow assigns zero spending to them. Finally, the variability in
spending at the individual level implied by the regression approach is significantly smaller than
the actual variation.

29

Relative to these issues, the propensity score approach has a number of strengths. It
requires fewer parametric assumptions and is, therefore, more robust with respect to the high
spenders and zero-spenders. Further, the second step of the propensity score approach allows us
to account for the number of comorbidities and volume of medical care received. These features
of the propensity score method permit us to relax the assumption that health care spending is
additive.
In practice, the most important difference between the propensity score method and the
regression method is the importance of unattributed spending. There is a base of $58 billion (9
percent of total spending) that the regression does not attribute to any condition.

In the

propensity score model, by contrast, all spending is automatically allocated to conditions.
Across conditions, the major difference between the two approaches is the much greater total
attributed to hypertension and signs and symptoms using the regression model.
While more research is certainly warranted, our tentative conclusion is that the propensity
score model offers a good theoretical and empirical methodology to decompose total medical
spending to conditions.

Figure 1: Distribution of Observed and Predicted Spending

Note: The distribution of observed cost was cut off at $100,000, omitting about 2% of beneficiaries. There are no beneficiaries with a
predicted spending above $80,500 in any of the models. Here, N=6,200 and weighted N=36,824,486. The regression and propensity
score methods are based on calibrated claims. The claims approach is based on actual claims except for about 5% of beneficiaries
with dollar amounts in the personal summary file(s) but no claims. For these beneficiaries, we used the claims imputed using the
NHANES and assigned dollars to calibrated medical conditions on that basis. PS-based – Propensity Score based method. Reg-based:

APPENDIX
Attributing Medical Spending to Conditions:
A Comparison of Methods

In this appendix, we present various technical aspects of the data assembly and analysis.

A.1 HMO enrollment adjustment
MCBS has incomplete or no claims information for beneficiaries enrolled in Health
Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). In 2009, approximately one-quarter of elderly beneficiaries
were enrolled in HMOs (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2014). To adjust for this, we developed a
weighting adjustment similar to the non-response adjustments performed for unit non-response
in national surveys (Little, 1986; Kreuter et al., 2010).
We began by defining two groups: those with complete Medicare enrollment and those
enrolled in HMOs.

We define complete Medicare enrollment as: (1) no participation in

Medicare Advantage program for the year of study, and (2) enrollment in traditional fee-forservice Medicare parts A & B for the full 12-month study period, unless the participant died
during the year.
We used a propensity score method to create the adjustment weights. We performed these
adjustments separately for the community and institutionalized population. Since the majority of
our sample (~92%) consisted of community residents, we present the results for the community
population here. A logistic regression model was estimated using selected covariates

1

(demographics, health status, and socio-economic variables) to model traditional Medicare
enrollment. Table A1 gives the list of covariates used for such adjustments. Using the predicted
probability (p) of complete Medicare enrollment, the adjustment for HMO enrollees was
calculated as 1/p. Model fit was assessed by a Hosmer-Lemeshow test.
Table A2 reports the Hosmer-Lomeshow goodness of fit statistics. In our estimation,
there were 10 groups and hence we had 8 degrees of freedom. The corresponding Chi-squared
values are also reported. The model passed the test suggesting a good fit.
To assess balance in the community population, the propensity of complete Medicare
enrollment was estimated using Generalized Liner Models (GLM); F-ratios were reviewed for
significance. In the institutionalized population, regression models were performed for each
covariate

to

assess

the

association

with

the

propensity

for

complete

Medicare

participation. Using the residuals from each model, we calculated effect size to assess
balance. We then calculated the “final weight” as the product of the existing MCBS survey
weight and the Medicare HMO adjustment weight.
Figure A1a gives the distribution of propensity scores for complete Medicare enrollment
for the 2009 Medicare community population. The overlap between the complete Medicare and
HMO populations was high. Table A3 shows the comparison between the complete Medicare
and HMO-adjusted elderly populations. In 2009, around 24.3 million elderly beneficiaries were
enrolled in traditional fee-for-service Medicare, and 12.5 million were in HMOs.

The

distributions of age, sex, race, education, marital status and health status were mostly similar
between the complete Medicare enrollment and HMO-adjusted populations.

2

A.2

Survey spending adjustment
A second adjustment was made so that total medical spending in the MCBS matched

what was reported to be national spending on the elderly. This adjustment was performed in
several steps. First, we removed expenditures from the National Health Expenditure Accounts
(NHEA) for goods and services which are out of scope of the MCBS survey: other non-durable
medical equipment (2.7%), other personal healthcare (2.6%), graduate medical education and
disproportionate share medical payments to hospitals (1%), hospital non–patient revenue such as
in the gift shop and for parking (3.2%), and spending by foreign visitors (0.12%). In total, this
accounted for 9.6% percent of NHEA spending (Rosen et al., 2017, NHEA, 2014).
Second, we redefined some categories of medical services in the NHEA and MCBS,
shifting expenditures as appropriate, to create consistent categories between the two sources.
Table A4 shows the adjustments we made and the dollar amounts moved. The total portion of
money shifted across categories was 4.2%.
Third, we proportionately increased spending in the MCBS by the factors necessary to
have total survey spending equal the remaining portion of the NHEA total in each service-bypayer category. Figure A2 gives the adjustment factors by each service category. Overall, the
NHEA-adjusted spending was 11 percent higher than the total spending reported in MCBS. The
adjustment was largest for home health (43%), but was generally small for the other types of
services.

A.3

Condition Definitions and Prevalence
We developed a classification schema for medical conditions building upon the Agency

for Healthcare Research and Quality’s (AHRQ) Clinical Classification Software (CCS), which

3

aggregates the 14,000+ ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes and 3,900+ ICD-9-CM procedure codes into
a smaller number of clinically meaningful, mutually exclusive categories (Elixhauser, Steiner,
and Palmer, 2014). For brevity, we do not describe the full process of forming the categories
here; interested readers are referred to Raghunathan et al. (2001, 2017). Creation of the mutually
exclusive, collectively exhaustive categories required the clinical expertise of physicians, and
extensive data management and analytic investigation, which resulted in 101 medical condition
categories and 4 cancer screening categories (for breast, prostate, colon and cervical cancer).
Our physician working group determined that a few conditions identified in larger CCS
categories should be stand-alone disease categories because of their clinical significance in the
elderly (mostly mental health). These were grouped into independent disease categories. For
example, while the CCS has a single “mood disorders” category, we separated this into two
separate groups – depression and bipolar disorder.
Prevalence rates for some conditions in the MCBS were below those based on selfreports and physical assessment in national surveys. This was generally true for chronic diseases
that are not serious enough to warrant a medical visit on their own, or at least not every year:
hypertension and high cholesterol, for example. By definition, undiagnosed conditions are also
not in MCBS. For such conditions, we used self-reports and diagnosed condition rates in
NHANES to estimate ‘calibrated’ health conditions that more accurately reflect national
prevalence rates. We term the results Calibrated Claims (CCL).
The imputation method proceeded in several steps. We chose to impute the community
and institutionalized populations separately given the differences in these populations. We
began by appending data from MCBS (2009) and NHANES (2009-2010). Each person was
placed into one of three groups: having the condition in the self-report (NHANES) or claims

4

(MCBS); not having the condition if the NHANES self-report indicated the beneficiary did not
have the health condition and there was no claim for the condition; and missing if there was no
claim for the health condition in the MCBS. We then had a standard missing data problem for
which we a used sequential regression multivariate imputation procedure.
For conditions present in NHANES, let D(−j) denote the collection of disease indicators
for all diseases except disease j. We constructed a propensity score for having disease j based on
fitting a logistic regression model to the other conditions and exogenous covariates, X, and
predicting with (X, D(−j)) strata based on the propensity scores. Within each propensity score
class, we estimated the prevalence rate using the self-report, Sj, and the claims Cj . If the
prevalence rate based on the claims was greater than or equal to that based on the self-report,
then we set all missing Dj to 0. That is, no additional imputation was necessary and all those with
no claims were considered not to have that health condition. If the self-report prevalence rate was
greater than the prevalence rate based on the claims, we randomly set some missing Dj to 1 so
that the prevalence rates after the imputation matched the self-report prevalence rates. We used
five Bernoulli draws within each propensity score class to achieve this calibration, resulting in
five imputed data sets.
Note that medical expenditure and health conditions without self-report are missing in the
NHANES portion of the appended data. To be fully conditional, these missing values were
imputed in the NHANES. These two steps – the disease imputations into MCBS and the medical
spending/health condition imputations into NHANES – were iterated across all diseases several
times until the multiply imputed prevalence rates stabilized.
The regression relationship between the multiply imputed Dj and claims-based Cj for
conditions available in NHANES may be viewed as a measurement error model and this

5

relationship is then used to calibrate other health conditions not present in NHANES. In this step,
we chose the most similar prevalent condition for the imputation.
The NHANES is a sample of the community dwelling population only. Thus, the claims
imputation for the institutionalized sample required some differences. For this population, the
calibrated non-institutionalized MCBS data was considered as the ‘donor’ survey in imputing
condition prevalence in the institutionalized population. For each claim, subjects were matched
according to the estimated propensity of being institutionalized given the self-report and
demographic information, and the remaining claims. To estimate this propensity, logistic
regression was utilized with a forward selection procedure on the principal components of the set
of variables of interest. Principal component analysis was used in an effort to explain as much of
the variation in propensity scores as possible while avoiding a complete separation of data points
given the small number of people who are institutionalized. Assuming that the probability of
being calibrated is the same conditional on institutionalization status, calibrated conditions are
drawn for the institutionalized population matching the distribution for the community
population.
The calibration process produces five imputed data sets for both community and
institutionalized populations. We use all five imputed data sets in our analysis using appropriate
survey weight and sample design adjustments. Importantly, prevalence based on the calibrated
conditions indicates diagnosis or treatment either currently or at any time in the past.
Because some of our 101 calibrated condition categories have relatively low prevalence
in the elderly, even after calibration, we collapsed our initial set of 101 medical conditions to 74
conditions with generally higher prevalence.

Table A5 shows prevalence rates for the 74

calibrated medical conditions and 4 cancer screening variables. We have also aggregated these

6

74 conditions into 17 multi-level categories (analogous to ICD-9-CM chapters), including one
for any cancer screening, which is how we group the table.

A.4

Analysis of different models
Figure A3 shows the kernel density plot comparison of the residuals (in blue) along with

the normal density (in red). Figures A4–A6 show additional residual diagnostic plots, including
standardized normal probability plots of the residuals, quantile plots of the residuals, and scatter
plots of the residuals relative to person-level costs. The out-of-sample predictions show that the
one-part model with log(cost+1) as the dependent variable and with a Gaussian distribution and
identity link had the lowest RMSE. Figure A3 shows that this model also fit well. The one and
two part cubic-roots were second best. The Gamma models with log link performed relatively
poorly than expected. These models are sensitive to high-spenders with big residuals – as
typified by people in nursing homes.
To evaluate the PSM estimates, we examined the relationship between predicted costs at
the individual level – estimated as the sum of the relevant

estimates for each subject – and

the observed cost. We plotted the error term, measured as the difference between naïve predicted
costs and true costs, against the number of health conditions, history of hospitalization and
institutionalization, and death. All these variables can be considered proxies for the volume or
intensity of care.
Figure A7 shows multiple plots of the difference between naïve predicted and observed
costs using the propensity-score models. Figure A7A relates the spending error to the number of
calibrated conditions. When the number of comorbidities is low – roughly 3 or fewer – there is
no systematic difference between predicted cost and observed cost: the error is about zero.
7

However, as the number of comorbidities increases, the naïve cost progressively overestimates
the observed cost. We have much fewer data for people with a very high number of conditions
(30 or more), but the estimates appear to come closer together after that point.
Figure A7B considers whether this pattern is different for people living in the community
versus institutions.

Negative residuals are much more prevalent in the institutionalized

population, indicating that naïve costs underestimate observed costs for institutionalized
beneficiaries – a natural finding given the high cost of institutionalization. However, the
dependence on number of comorbidities remains similar in both groups.
Figure A7C shows how number of hospitalizations affects costs, given the number of
health conditions. The incidence of hospitalization is associated with a higher number of
comorbidities. A subgroup of beneficiaries without hospitalizations shows a roughly linear
dependence of costs on the number of calibrated conditions. For the those who were hospitalized
at least for one night, the dependence is nonlinear, and the trend is similar to one observed in
Figure A7A.
Finally, Figure A7D shows how survivor status affects costs. Death slightly reduces a
positive bias of naïve cost. All told, Figure A7 suggests a need for a non-linear adjustment to the
disease cost estimates. We have adjusted for the non-linearity on the propensity score models.

Overall

Type of Service
Note: Figure 2 gives the adjustment factor for different types of services. Overall, the adjusted National
Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA) spending is 11 percent higher than the total spending reported in
2009 MCBS. We use these adjustment factors by service categories to adjust costs for MCBS-reported
services to the national level.

Note: CCS refers to 259 Clinical Classification Software categories delineated by the Agency for Health
Care Research and Quality. Prevalence rates are for health conditions that were ‘calibrated’ using
information from NHANES to refine the estimates of medical conditions in MCBS. First, missing data
on demographic, socio-economic and self-reported medical conditions in MCBS and NHANES were
imputed using a sequential regression multiple–imputation procedure. We then used a multi-step
calibration processes to impute a set of 101 health indicators and 4 screening variables that we call
“calibrated medical conditions.” This process included these steps: (1) calibration of conditions that have
Self-Report (SR) available in NHANES; (2) calibration of conditions with no Self-Report (SR) in
NHANES and (3) calibration of the institutionalized population for all conditions. This calibration
process produced five imputed data sets. The average prevalence rates reported here were calculated
using all five imputed data sets using MIANALYZE SAS 9.4. Table A3 is sorted from highest to lowest
prevalence within each broad disease category.

Note: The cost model regressed the logarithm of spending (plus $1) on the 78 condition and screening indicators and 22 demographic and other covariates.
Lifestyle covariates include information on inpatient activity and institutionalization, as well as difficulty with common life-skills such as eating, walking,
stooping, lifting and dressing. In addition to the common demographic characteristics such as age, race, and gender, the regression incorporates self-reported
indications of health comparisons to one year prior and to others of the same age as well as smoking history, poverty category, educational attainment, and
service in the armed forces. Two of the condition groups have negative coefficients for all five of the multiply imputed data sets: DVT and Acute Renal Failure.
As a result we are unable to attribute spending to these conditions. In the situation where coefficients were negative for only a selection of the five multiples they
were treated as missing in the subsequent steps of the analysis.
