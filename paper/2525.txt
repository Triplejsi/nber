to Komlos (1987) an increase

Rapid urbanization

Through the

lens of anthropometric data we examine the extent of relative deprivation of the

urban poor, changes in standards of living in mid-century and during the Civil
War, and the relationship between birthweight and infant mortality.

Mean birthweightsof Almshouse infants by year of birth are graphed in Figure

While the overall mean was 3,377 grams, the average birthweight fluctuated

from year to year and across decades.

The average birthweight rose in the early

1850s reaching a peak in 1856, fell through the Civil War years reaching a trough

in 1866, and then increased from 1866 to 1873.

why Irish babieswereheavier is unclear, although one possibility
is ethnic differences in mother's height: Irish mothers may have been taller

According to Margo and Steckel's (1983) study of antebellum heights,
persons born in large cities (population of 10,000 or more) were significantly
shorter as adults than persons born in rural areas. Thus our finding suggests
that the rural-urban difference in adult height may have originated in part in
the fetal period.

Cheney (1984) argues that some portion of high infant mortality during
the summer months may have been related to nutritional deficiencies.
Steckel (198Gb) shows that, among slaves, seasonal variations in
birthweight were a major factor behind seasonal variations in infant mortality.

But,

as pointed out previously, the hospital served an impoverished clientele, and one
might have expected birthweights of Almshouse infants to have been even lower than
those of their richer contemporaries and considerably lower than today.

13

As appears to have been typical of hospitals during the period, the weights were
reported to the quarter-pound, but heaping alone would not bias the mean.
The strongest argument against measurement error is that birthweights were
similarly high at lying-in hospitals in ocher cities. According to data collected

by Storer (1850), the mean birthweight at Boston's Lying-In Hospital in the late
l840s was

3,368 grams.

Mean birthweights at a lying-in hospital in Montreal

during the secondhalf of the nineteenth century ranged from 3,200 to 3,600 grams,
depending

on the decade (Ward and Ward,

1984).

These babies were often stillborn or dead shortly after

Judging by their mortality experience, which was far worse than average,

the average birthweight of babies who were not weighed must have been between
1,000 and 2,000 grams.

Approximately 4 percent of all infants were not weighed.

If each weighed 1,000 grams (the lower bound), the overall mean birthweight would
fall from 3,377 to 3,243 grams.

Modern studies in less-developed countries demonstrate that food supplements and
reductions

in work effort late in pregnancy result in increased birthweights

(Lechtig, at al., 1975; Naeye and Peters, 1982). As pointed Out previously, some
mothers would have been brought to the Almshouse weeks before delivery, and they

may have benefited from lessened physical labor and a more nutritious diet than
that obtainable outside the Almshouse)4

argument in the case of Boston, see Vogel (1980). According
to Ashby's (1915) study of early twentieth century England, pregnant women who

A regression of birthweights in the linked (1854) sample indicates that women

infants who were 115 grams heavier than average.16

The ameliorative impact of the Almshouse

suggests that at least some of Philadelphia's poor received considerably better
care within the confines of the poorhouse than outside it)'7
Accounting for the two downward adjustments, average birthweights among the

urban poor ranged between 2,900 and 3,200 grams around 1850 to 1870, or about 8

register for the name of the mother for all days previous to the date of birth.
Because this procedure proved to be extremely costly, we were able to perform the
linkage for only a single year. The year 1854 was chosen because the number of
births was relatively high.

the evidence presented above on the short adult stature of the urban poor and

Thus the urban poor began life at a nutritional disadvantage.

(Stein. at al., 1975; Hurley, 1980; Naeye and Peters, 1982; Tanner,

1978; Hytten and Leitth,

1971).

Except for genetic predisposition, it is likely

that all other factors mattered among the urban poor, although their relative
importance cannot be deduced from the available evidence.19

That the mothers of

the urban poor would have been poorly nourished by modern standards and subject

to a variety of infections, seems impossible to doubt, given their general poverty
and poor environmental conditions. Labor force participation rates among foreignborn and single women were high (Dublin, 1979; Goldin and Sokoloff,

1982;

18

For example, a mean birthweight falling between 3,000 and 3,100 grams
would be close to levels observed in Mexico and Thailand in the mid-1950s
(Meridith, 1970 ,p. 232). The estimated range is also similar to the range of
see Tanner
birthweights recorded at lying- in hospitals in nineteenth-century Europe;
(1981).
19

Genetic factors may be ruled out because it is doubtful that genetic
differences among the urban poor were large, given the populations from which
they were drawn. Short maternal stature, however, may account for some of the
reduced birthweight.
According to Hytten and Leitch (1971, p. 308) birthweight
declines by about 20 grams per inch of mother's height.
Although we have no
information on the adult heights of urban women during the period, adult female
slaves were about 1.5 inches below modern standards (Steckel, 1986a). Since it
is doubtful that urban women differed significantly in stature from adult
female slaves (a conclusion suggested by the evidence on adult male heights),
short maternal stature could explain at most 12 percent (30/250) of reduced
birthweights among the urban poor.

20
According to Abel (1982) daily consumption of more than 2 ounces of
absolute alcohol by pregnant women is associated with a
significantly increased
risk of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and reduced birtliweight. Rorabaugh's (1979)
estimates of absolute alcohol consumption during the late antebellum period are
close to or exceed this figure and, as he points out, there is no evidence that
women were generally more temperate than men.

21

It might be argued that the decline in birthweight during the Civil War,
and the absence of an upward trend itt birthweight over the whole
period, may be
misleading for the urban poor as a whole. The number of births at the hospital
was roughly constant from year to year (except during the Civil War, when the number
of births fell). If the population from which Almahouse mothers were drawn was
increasing in size over time, the Almshouse admittance policy may have produced
a group of mothers that was increasingly impoverished over time, especially
during the Civil War. This tendency would be offset, however, by increases over
time in the real incomes of the urban poor. Unfortunately, a direct examination
of the hypothesis is not possible, because we lack detailed information on the
socioeconomic background of the mothers.

First-day deaths were 14.8 per 1000 live births in 1935 and 9.3 per 1000 live

births in 1964 (Shapiro, Ct

through physical means or the use of chemical abortifacients26 But the firstday death rate and the implied neonatal death rate are also higher, aspecially
among infants weighing under 2,500 grams.

In 1950 the neonatal death rate under

2,500 grams was 173.1 per 1000 live births, and the neonatal death rate was twice

Our estimate

the first day death rate (Shapiro, et al,, 1965, pp. 271, 318)27

of the first-day death rate for babies under 2,500 grams is 125.8 per 1000 live
births.

Doubling the figure gives an estimate of the neonatal death rate of

per 1000 live births, 45 percent higher than the figure in 1950.

Furthermore,

it is likely our estimate is biased do%mward, because the ratio of the neonatal
death rate to the frat-day death rate declined over time (Shapiro, at al., 1965,
p. 271).

sex was unrelated to mortality.30

Somewhat surprisingly, the child's

The seasonand year of birth also had no effect

on the probability of infant death.31

Compared with other ethnic groups, Irish

babies faced a greater risk of dying, although the difference was small relative

to other factors.32
28
Shapiro, et al. (1965, pp. 320-21) show that the fetal death rate increases
with the age of the mother beyond age 20, and that the neonatal death rate has
an inverted U-shape with respect to mother's age. The inverted U-pattern is
consistent with the signs of the age and age squared coefficients in the regression
of first-day deaths. The coefficient on parity in the regression of first-day
deaths is also consistent with modern data, which shows a strong positive
relationship between parity and infant mortality, particularly for women under
age 25 (the majority of Almshouse mothers); see Shapiro, et al. (1965, jj.)
29
The result presumably reflects the transmission of venereal disease from
the mother to the fetus.

30

The result is puzzling, because in modern data males have higher fetal
and perinatal death rates than females, although the differences are small; see
Shapiro, et al. (1965, p. 311).

31 The infant death
rate, not controlling for other factors, was 25 percent
higher in the l860s than in the l850s. Thus the insignificant coefficients on
the year of birth dummies imply that the factors controlled for in the regression-in particular, birthweight--account for the rise in mortality during the Civil
War decade.

One explanation of the higher mortality among Irish infants concerns
presumably the vast

in Irish neighborhoods, unwed Irish mothers may have tried to induce
abortona more often than other mothers, or engage in other activities (for
example, hide the pregnancy from relatives, and have little or no prenatal

perhaps more likely, the effect may be due to ethnic differences in socioeconomic

Because moat beoies in the nineteenth century ware delivered by midwives,
and midwives used forceps infrequently, the forceps explanation may be relevant
only for hospital births. Midwives, however, also followed the non-intervention
regimen, which by itself increased the frequency of first-day deaths,
34
For example, oteckel (l986a) estimated slave neonatal mortality in a
four stage procedure: He first estimated a regression of height at ages 3 and
4 on birthwaight, using modern data. Next, ha used the regression coefficients
to predict the mean birthwaight of slave infants, given slave heights at ages 3

by those under 2,500 grams at birth, and the death rate under 2,500 grams varies
little across countries, developed or underdeveloped (Fogel, 1987, p. 477).

Our

results suggest, however, that the mortality schedule by birthweight has not been

stable over time.

Infant death rates under 2,500 grams were considerably higher

in the nineteenth century than they are today. It follows that estimates of infant

Adjusting for various biases, it appears that the children of the urban

poor weighed between 2,900 and 3,200 grams at birth, or 250 to 550 grams below
modern standards.

Birthweights declined during the Civil War decade, consistent

with the poor state of the economy in the 1860s. Because birthweights were lower
than modern standards, the urban poor suffered higher levels of infant mortality
than today,

Leavitt (1986), for example, argues that while infant mortality was

at least in the short run, increased.
