Optimal Policies with Strategic Distortions

ABSTRACT

Recent work in optimal trade

policy

for imperfectly competitive markets

usually identifies the optimal level of an instrument, and when more
instruments are allowed, general interpretations have been unavailable,

This

paper analyzes the jointly optimal levels of a Variety of instruments with
oligopolistic competition.

A targeting principle for identifying optimal

policies is derived using the concept of a "strategic distortion."

It is

shown how optimal policies vary with the distortions present and the number of
firms, as well as assumptions about market segmentation and regulation.

The

principles of targeting are illustrated using agricultural marketing boards.

Introduction

Our understanding of the way in which perfectly competitive markets
function, and of optimal policy for such markets when various distortions
exist is quite good.

among others, and their non-uniqueness is explained by the Lerner

symmetry theorem, Lerner (1936),

In contrast to this, our understanding of

optimal policy in oligopolistic markets is more limited,

The former have effects like those of a regime change while the latter do
not.2

Even the literature on indirect policies makes different assumptions

about factors which affect the results.

Assumptions about the strategic

variables used, the number of firms, possible distortions, and the instruments
considered vary among papers.

Assumptions about market segmentation, or the

lack of it, and regulations on firm behavior are also crucial and have not
been systematically analyzed.

In

-

this paper we develop a targeting approach which helps explain the

nature of optimal policies and how they vary with differences in the above
assumptions.

Since the literature has focused on the first set of assumptions

given above, there is some understanding of how optimal policies vary with

these assumptions.

Our contribution here is to identify overall optimal

policies and show that they can be interpreted in a targeting framework.

This

provides a unified way of looking at much of the literature and shows how
confining attention to one policy, as is often done, can result in the
identification of overall suboptimal policies.

In addition, we use this

framework to analyze how regulations influence optimal policies by linking
distortions and creating new ones, both of which affect the targeting of
policies.

We consider regulations which limit domestic monopoly power, as

well as arbitrage, which we show should be thought of as a form of regulation.
We analyze optimal policies for marketing boards since these provide a rich
variety of types of distortions and regulations.

Next, we briefly survey how

our work relates to other work in strategic trade policy.
Earlier work, such as that of Auquier and Caves (1979), deals with trade
policies when there is monopoly.

Work on oligopoly began with that of Spence

and Brander (1983), who analyze a Cournot duopoly with one home and one
foreign firm and show that an export subsidy can improve welfare.3 Eaton and
Grossman (1986) show that the strategic variable used is critical.

They

identify a strategic distortion using a conjectural variations model, and the
show that this distortion may require a tax on exports with Bertrand
competition.

This strategic distortion differs from the usual terms of trade

distortion.4

Dixt

(1984) and Eaton and Grossman analyze policy when there

are more firms and domestic consumption.
Only a few papers in

this

area consider more than one policy instrument.

Eaton and Grossman consider the direction of production and trade taxes
or develop a

targeting approach.

For the Cournot case, Spencer and Brander (1983) consider

jointly optimal R&O and export policies.

Dixit (1984) examines optimal

production and trade tax/subsidies in the Cournot case, and Dixit (1986)
studies how optimal trade and production taxes are affected by changes in
parameters using a conjectural variations model and a linear example.

Dixit

(1988) calculates the optimal levels of these instruments for a simulation
model of the U.S. automobile industry.

Cheng (1986) analyzes optimal tariffs

and production subsidies for a linear example.

A

targeting approach is not

the focus of any of this work, and most of it deals with segmented markets,5
Our work is also related to the literature on agricultural marketing
boards.

The work most closely related to ours is that of Just et al. (1979),

Markusen (1984). and Thursby (l987).6

While they consider some of the types

of marketing boards we do, neither Just et al, (1979) nor Markusen (1984)
focus on strategic interactions between boards.

Thursby (1987) does consider

strategic interactions between boards but confines her analysis to a linear
Cournot example when markets are segmented.
The next section sets up the oroblem and discusses the institutional
variations we consider.

Sections 3 and 4 contain the analysis of duopoly with

in these sections each board is the sole supplier to

consumers in its home market and competes with a foreign board in a third
market.

Thus, there are

monopoly power which causes it to sell too little at home.

These production

and consumption distortions are shown to be optimally targeted by production
and consumption subsidies.

In addition, there is a strategic distortion along

the lines of Eaton and Grossman (1986).

This arises due to the boards

inability to precommit to output levels.

The government's ability to

precommit to taxes and subsidies allows it to correct this distortion.

poicy optimally targets this distortion and may require a tax or subsidy
exports depending on the strategic variable, as shown in Section 3.
Section 4 considers the effect of a regulation which limits domestic
monopoly power by enforcing marginal cost pricing at home.

This regulation

links distortions by linking domestic and export sales, and this is reflected
in the optimal targeting rule.

While the regulation removes the consumption

distortion, it creates another distortion since it encourages boards to raise
exports in order to raise marginal cost and domestic price.

Optimal policy

can be implemented by a single instrument, the trade tax/subsidy, and its
level

is determined by both the linkage of distortions and the strategic

distortion.
The following section extends the analysis to many boards at home and
abroad,

As expected, having more domestic boards reduces market power in the

domestic market which reduces both consumption and production distortions.

It

also creates a terms of trade distortion because the existence of many home
boards removes the ability of a board to fully internalize the effects of its
actions on the terms of trade.

The strategic distortion remains but depends

In this case the targeting principle suggests that

trade tax/subsidies be directed towards the terms of trade distortion as well
as the strategic distortion.

In Section 6, we

consider

the effects of arbitrage on targeting.

With

arbitrage a board cannot determine the amount of home and foreign sales
independently.

In this case, a board which is regulated in its domestic

pricing will be forced to act much like a competitive board.

we show that the

optimal policy in such a case is a trade policy targeted towards the terms of
trade distortion, as this is the only distortion present.

Without price

regulation, there is room for strategic behavior on the part of the board.

As

was the case with market segmentation, the board's inability to precommit
creates a strategic distortion which the government can offset because of its
ability to precommit to tax/subsidy policies.

With arbitrage, however, the

inability of the board to determine home and foreign sales independently links
distortions, and this affects the targeting of policy.

In particular, our

results suggest targeting a consumption subsidy to offset any consumption
distortion, and targeting a production subsidy toward the remaining
distortions including the strategic distortion.

In addition, we show that the

consumption distortion is linked through arbitrage to the price abroad and the

strategic

distortion includes a linkage effect as well.

Recall that linkage

effects are not present and do not affect policy with market segmentation
unless domestic price is regulated.
These results suggest that a useful way to think of policy comparisons in
situations with and without arbitrage is in terms of a change in regime.

That

is, arbitrage fundamentally changes the way the board is able to operate, and

arbitrage, like a regulation, constrains the profit maximization opportunities
open to the board.

This in turn affects optimal policy.

Notice the costs of the RN and SN boards differ.

because the per unit cost to the RN board is the competitive supply price
which rises as the amount purchased increases. Its total cost is this supply

However total cost to the SN board,

The Case of Many

Market-ins

In this section we analyze optimal government policy when there are
domestic marketing boards and m* foreign marketing boards.

m

While Sections 3

and 4 describe the cases one usually thinks of with regard to agricultural
marketing boards; there are cases where different regions within a country
have their own marketing boards,

In addition, our analysis is intended to

apply to policy targeting for any oligopolistic industry where imperfectly
competitive exporters purchase a product from competitive producers to sell
both at home and in world markets.

Hence it is of interest to know how the

number of boards in the domestic and

foreign market affects optimal policy.

We shall present the analysis for boards which maximize profits in the

absence of regulation.

As in Section 3, domestic boards are the sole

suppliers to domestic consumers, and compete with foreign boards in the thirc
market.

They are assumed to price discriminate between their domestic markel

and the third market.

We choose this example to illustrate the effect of

having more boards because of the existence of both producer and consumer
surplus distortions.
Recall that optimal policy was determined by three kinds of distortions
when a single domestic marketing board and a single foreign board competed
a third market.

A

consumption distortion called for a consumption

ir

-19subsidy/tax,

a production distortion called for a production subsidy/tax, and

a strategic distortion called for an export subsidy/tax.

As the number of

boards in the domestic market is increased, we would expect the consumption
and production distortions to decrease because the ability of boards to
exercise monopoly or monopsony power would decline.

As these distortions

decline we would expect the role of government policy in offsetting them to
decline.

Also, the results of Dixit (1984) and Eaton and Grossman (1986) show

that the strategic distortion depends on the number of boards and that a terms
of trade distort,on is created because of the inabflty of a domestic board to
internalize the effects of its actions on the terms of trade.

This intuition

is easily verified.
in oroer to focus on the effect of market size on distortions, we present
the case of many marketing boards with Cournot competition.

We look at

identical boards at home and, similarly, at identical boards abroad, and
consider the symmetric equilibrium.
Profits of the ith domestic board are given in Table 3.

Capital V and X

denote total sales of all domestic boards at home and in the third market, and
X* denotes total sales of foreign exporting boards in the third market.
Profits of the jth foreign board are given by an analogous equation.

Conclusion

In this paper we have attempted to illustrate how the oonoept of a
strategio distortion can be used to identify optimal polioy in imperfectly
competitive markets, and to derive an analogue of the targeting principle for
competitive markets.

As we have shown, this is such easier, when price

disorimination is allowed between markets, as arbitrage links markets togetner
creating muitimarket effects of a policy.

However, even in the presence of

arbitrage and in the absence of regulation, the strategic distortion
infThences only (s÷v), the wedge between the producer price and the consume
price in the third market,

the world price.

It does not affect (sr),

in this case, the government can

have no effect on welfare unless it has some advantage, informational or
otherwise over the board.

However, in general, any objective function on the

part of the board and of government can be handled and the results will, of
course, be sensitive to the formulation employed.
it may be argued that the direction of the strategic distortion is hard

to identify in practice; however, recent work suggests that computable partial
equilibrium models, such as Dixit (1288), can be used to estimate the
strategic distortion, making practical applications feasible.

paper we assign instruments to distortions following economic intuition.

way of pinning this down would be to include a cost of such policies but this

here

We beiieve that our work is important for at least two reasons.

First,

it shows that use of trade policy should be examined, in terms of optimality,

by considering all existing distortions and avalable instruments.

This is

because trade policy may be unable to target all the distort4ons and thus be
far from first best when consioered in isolation-

Our targeting principle

allows us to interpret when trade policy is first best.
Second, while computable part1al equil4brium models promise to help
formulate optimal policy, our results show that optimal poiicy is sensitive to
assumptions about market structure, arbitrage, and regulation.

The use of

such models is warranted only when sensitivity analysis ndicates the results

Our work would

help in developing model variations for sensitivity analysis and in
interpreting the results of such exercises.

In future work we hope to provide

further applications of targeting as well as address some of the issues raised
above.

Just et al. (1979) derive optimal policy for each of the institutional

variations in marketing boards we consider in Sections 3 and 4.

However,

their analysis is of a marketing board which is a monopolist in the world
market, so that strategic effects are absent.

Their analysis is also a

partial equilibrium one like ours.
Markusen (1984) examines a board which maximizes producer surplus, with
and without regulation.

His analysis is a general equilibrium one, but his

focus is not on strategic interactions between boards.

real life marketing boards and how such boards operate in different countries.

Greater product differentiation can be allowed, but as it adds little to
he interpretations offered and does complicate the derivations.

In later

ections when we allow arbitrage, we assume the same homogeneous good is
roduced by both domestic and foreign firms as product differentiation greatly
omplicates tne analysis.
The standard objection to conjectural variations models is the absence of
well defined extensive form.

However, we feel that its usefulness in
