the purpose of this paper is to develop a general theoretical

franework, the question it addresses was motivated by the recent experience
of the Mexican economy (see Feltenstein and Morris

(1987),

Jarque (1987)

and Jung (1987)).
With but minor abuse of language we can pose the question that is the
title of this paper in terms of the demand for and supply of seigniorage
revenue.

Monetary financing is viewed as the residual financing mode of

the government.

Specifically, real per capita public spending, current and

capital, are treated as exogenous as are real per capita lump sum

and the "seigniorage tax base" (the real stock of money

balances or the real stock of money balances per capita, m).
Across

steady states there is a one—for—one association between the

seigniorage tax rate and the rate of inflation; in classical flex—price

say for

The seigniorage

tax

is indeed often referred to as the inflation tax and we will follow this
rather sioppy usage.
Given the seigrtiorage tax base, there will be a unique seigniorage tax
rate

that

generates

("supplies)

the

required

seigniorage

revenue.

However, because the velocity of circulation of high—powered money is not
independent of the (expected) inflation rate,

the seigniorage tax base is

likely to vary (negatively) with the seigniorage tax rate,
the long run.

This leads to the possibility of a

at any rate in

seigniorage Laffer

curve": the elasticity of the seigniorage tax base with respect

to the

seigniorage tax rate can become greater than unity in absolute value,2 so
higher growth rates of the nominal money stock (and sooner or later higher
actual and expected inflation) will appropriate a smaller amount of real
resources for the government.
If there is perfect

international capital mobility

and the long—run

real interest rate is independent of the government's spending behaviour, a
cut in public consumption spending reduces the long—run rate of inflation
as long as, if there are multiple rates of inflation yielding the same real

The money demand effect is the effect

of a lower public sector capital stock on money demand (at a given real

(some measure of income or wealth) in the money demand function.

Such an exchange rate management rule

mimics a freely floating exchange rate except for the absence (under the

With a predetermined nominal exchange rate, any stock—shift changes in the
demand for real money balances (say in response to a change in the nominal
interest rate) will be reflected in changes in the stock of international
reserves.

As regards the behaviour of real money balances (per capita), m,

this regime is identical to a freely floating exchange rate regime.

the latter regime, discontinuous changes in the nominal exchange rate in
