the Determi nants of the Value of
Call Options on Default—Free Bonds

On

ABSTRACT

Models of interest—dependent claims that imply similar term structures and
levels of interest rate volatility also produce similar estimates of bond
option values.

This result is established for simple option forms with known

closed-form solutions am well as for more complex options that require
numerical methods for evaluation.

The finding is confirmed for a wide range of

economic conditions, and it is robust with respect to the number and nature of
factors that generate interest—rate movements.

Early contributions to the theory of bond options suggest
techniques

that

for pricing options on stock can be adapted with relatively minor

refinementaj Subaequent research indicates potential difficulties.

For

example, Gourtadon (1982) and Buser and Hendershott (1984) show that call
values are sensitive to multiple unobservable parameters even in the simple
case of a one-factor interest-rate process. Brennan and Schwartz (1983,
1985) and Dietrich-Campbell

and Schwartz (1986) conclude that call values

are sensitive to the number as well as the nature of interest rate factors.
Difficulties in specifying and estimating numerous unobservable parameters
of an uncertain interest rate process would thus appear to present a
formidable barrier to the implementation

of bond option pricing models.2

In this paper, we re-examine alternative models for pricing debt
options and conclude that practical application is not substantially more

difficult than in

the case of stock options.

The term structure and

volatility of interest rates serve as summary characteristics

of the economy

for bond options, just as the stock price and volatility of stock returns
are summary characteristics

of the economy for stock options.

Traditional

comparative-staticexperiments that reportedly test for the specific effects
of a given parameter

(or model) are misleading in so far as the summary

characteristics of the economy typically change in the experiment. We

alternative

models of the interest-rate process produce similar

estimates of bond option values.

Accordingly, even if researchers disagree

about the determinants of either the term structure or the level of
volatilityof interest rates, they should still agree on the implications of
a given term structure and level of volatility for bond option values.
Our results are robust with respect to the interest rate environment.
Cases of high versus low interest-rate uncertainty are examined for three
term structures: steeply upward sloping; gently upward sloping; and downward
sloping.

To guard against the chance that our results are unique to one

particular contract, we examine three very different options including: (I)
a 2-year call option on a 10-year zero-coupon bond, <2) a 2-year call option
on a 30-year coupon bond, and (3) the borrower's option to prepay a 30-year
fully-amortizing

mortgage.

The remainder of our paper is divided into six sections.

The first

presents our formal assertions about the fundamental determinants of bond
option values.

Section II describes the alternative models of the interest

rate process that we consider.

Procedures for comparing alternative models

are discussed in Section III, and simulation results are presented in
Sections IV and V.

A

brief summary concludes the paper.

I. Properties

of Bond-Option Values

Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (1976/85), hereafter CIR, show that the
equilibriumvalue of any interest-dependent

claim can be represented as a

solution to a fundamental pricing equation subject to appropriateboundary

conditions.

We describe this equation in detail in the next section.

we simply let

Here

denote the set of parameter values which, together with the

current interest rate, r, describes the fundamental pricing equation.

The

primary contention of this paper is that as few as two characteristics

of 8

may be sufficient to value options on default-free debt.

The measures that

we propose are y, the slope of the term structure of yields on default-free
zero-coupon bonds, and a, the level of interest-rate volatility.

These summary characteristics allow us to clarify and extend two
propositions

that have been established for specific options and specific

models of the interest-rate process.

Our third proposition asserts that

any remaining bond-optionpricing effects are of secondary

We begin this section with a general model of the interest-rate process

the

Because the factors describe the economy completely, security values

III. Procedures for Comparing Alternative Models

Risk-Neutral

Analogs for Risk-Averse Models

CIR observe that it is always possible to construct a risk-neutral
analog for any risk-averse specification of the fundamental equation (6).
In the case of a single-factor mean-reverting model (6'), the mean and speed
of adjustment for the matching risk-neutral process are:

(15)

Equations (13), (14) and (15) are not based on precise analytic
rules.

Nevertheless, these ad hoc controls reflect our intuition about

models of the interest rate process, and, as we show in the remainder of the
paper, they provide an adequate summary of interest-rate volatility for the
purpose of pricing bond options.

IV. Call Options on Zero-Coupon Bonds

Closed-form solutions for the value of a call option on a zero-coupon

bond have been developed by CIR (equation 32, p.396), Ball and Torous (1983,
equation 8, p528), and Jamshidian (1987, equation 7a,

p7).

In all three

formulas, the price of the option (C) is a weighted difference between the
values of two default-free bonds:
the underlying zero-coupon bond; and
B1,
82,

a zero-coupon bond with maturity equal to that of the option:

C

In equation (16), K is the exercise price of the option, and the weights are

of the respective models. CIR employ the squareroot form of elastic volatility (a—l/2), and use the chi-square distribution
to define
and N2. Volatility is inelastic in the Jamshidian model (a-O)
determined

and

by parameters

N1 and N2 are determined by the normal distribution.
Equation (16) bears a striking resemblance to the familiar Black-

Scholes (1972) equation for a stock option; the long bond (B1) corresponds
to the stock, and the short bond (B2) corresponds to the present value
factor (exp-rT).

Ball and Torous draw the analogy even more tightly by

observing that their version of (16) is identical to Merton's (1973)

extension of the Black-Scholes equation that incorporates stochastic
interest rates.

The closed-form solutions of CIR and Jamshidian correspond to special
cases of the one-factor model represented by equation (6').

By focusing on

these cases, we can examine our basic propositions without relying on
numerical methods.

We can then use the closed-form results to verify the

numerical procedures

that are required under more general conditions.

Economic Environments

Panel

A

of Table 1 reports option values for four specifications of

one-factor models that have been fit to nine very different economic
environments; three term structure slopes are examined for each of three
different levels of interest rate volatility,

The slopes cover the gamut

from a downward sloping yield curve (minus 100 basis points) to a steeply
upward sloping yield curve (plus 300 basis points).

13

The intermediate case

corresponds to a "normal" slope of plus 100 basis points.

The choice of

volatility levels ranges from a value that is low by historical standards
(so_0.0l5) to one that is high (s°—0.045).

The construction of Panels A and B differs from that for Panel A of
Table 1 in three respects.

First, we only report numerical results based on

12 changes in interest rates per year.

Second, we only report results for

risk-neutral specifications because, as in the case of Table 1, results for

appropriately matched risk-averse models are identical.

Third, we expand

the class of models to include two-factor models as well as well as one-

factor models, and we examine the unit-elastic case in addition to the
inelastic and square-root specifications of the interest-rate process.

Enviroents

Economic

To design appropriate tests of our claim that one-factor analogs can be
found for two-factor price structures, we must take care to avoid trivial
comparisons.

For example, we should not focus on cases where the factors

are highly correlated or where one factor clearly dominates the other.
factors that are uncorrelatedbut which are similar in structure

can be replicated by one-factor models with relative ease.

Even

These concerns

suggest that the speeds of adjustment should differ for the individual

factors.

specific.

In Panels

A

and B of Table 2, an increase in the slope of the

term structure clearly lowers call values, and an increase in volatility
clearly raises call values.

In addition, the patterns for the effects

appear to be similar to those established for call options on zero-coupon
bonds.

For either the coupon bond or the mortgage,

an increase in the slope

of the term structure (from downward to normal or from normal to steeply
upward) cuts the value of the option by roughly one third in the case of low

volatility and by roughly one fourth in the case of high volatility.

The

percentage effect of a change in volatility increases with the slope of the
term structure but at a much lower rate than in the zero-coupon case; the

increase is roughly 40% with the downward sloping term structure and 70%
with a steeply upward term structure.
The additional simulations also confirm our earlier findings regarding
model-specific effects.

Option values are insensitive to whether risk

aversion or expectations accounts for the slope of the term structure.
(Results are omitted because they are identical.)

Option values are also

insensitive to the number of interest-rate factors used to generate the term
structure.

Only the elasticity parameter emerges as a potential model-

specific determinant of simulated option values; call values are noticeably
smaller when the elasticity parameter is increased.

Patterns in the effect

are similar to those established for options on zero-couponbonds.

The

percentage effect of increasing elasticity is greatest when volatility is
high and the yield curve is downward sloping; differences in value estimates
are as large as 10% for the bond option and 15% for the mortgage option.
Part of the effect we have attributed to elasticitymay in fact be due
to our inability to match volatilities precisely at all interest rates.

19

Accordingly,

even the apparent effect of elasticity could be due more to the

general effect of volatility than to a truly model-specific effect,

support of this interpretation, we note that
elasticity are uniform in sign and magnitude.

In

the apparent effects of

Specifically, call values

decline at a uniform rate as elasticity is increased, and the magnitude of
the effect declines as the slope of the term structure is increased.

These

patterns suggest that it may be possible to improve on our procedures for
controlling for differences in volatility.

For example, the apparent effect

of elasticity might be reduced if interest-rate expectations were used

ifl

the volatility control.5Alternatively, we note that even if models are

constructed to provide comparable levels of volatility at the prevailing
interest rate, an increase in elasticity reduces the probability of very low
interest rates (the range most relevant for call options).

Thus it might be

more appropriate to standardize models on the basis of the probability of
interest rate less than some critical value.
Although we are guardedly optimistic that such improvements are
possible, the pursuit of such refinements is beyond the intended scope of
this paper.

Our purpose was simply to show that differences in estimates

between models are far less than is currently perceived, provided that

measure for one model that equates the option estimate with a matching model
for some benchmark case. Such an adjustment would be contract-specific,
contrary to the spirit of our current investigation. Nevertheless the
fit
technique would be of interest if it could be shown to improve the
between models for all contracts over the full range of economic
environments.

to impose comparable levels of interest-rate

decreasing

function of the slope of the term structure and an increasing function of
the volatility of interest rates.

Little else seems to matter.

In

particular, bond option values are not sensitive to either the number of

factors driving the interest-rate process or the reason that the term
structure has a given slope.

Bond option values appear to be moderately

sensitive to the degree of interest-rate elasticity in volatility, but even
this result may say more about our ad hoc controls for volatility than it
does about the fundamental determinants of bond option values.

Thus we

conclude that even if elaborate models of the interest-rate
process are

required to estimate volatility, they are not needed to price bond options.
In the absence of analytic results, we can not claim confirmation for
all possible specifications of multiple factor models.

Nevertheless,

we

regard our simulations as sufficiently compelling to encourage, if not
require, future advocates of multiple factor models of bond-option values to

make relevant comparisons vis a vis a comparable one-factor models.

As a

minimum, the slope of the term structure and the level of interest-rate
volatility must be the same for competing models.

Contract assumptions:
The face amount of the mortgage is $100, and the coupon is set such that a
noncallable mortgage would initially be priced at par. That is, the value
of the prepayment option represents the "points" or initial discount from
par for the mortgage. The exercise price for the option at time t is the
outstanding loan balance.
