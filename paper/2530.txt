Change in Market Assessments of
Deposit—Institution Riskiness

ABSTRACT

Using the Goldfeld and Quandt switching regression method, this paper
investigates variability over 1915-85 in the risk components of bank and
saving and loan stock. We develop evidence that the market-beta, interest:
sensitivity,

and

residual

risk of deposit-institution stock vary

significantly during this period. Reassessing previous event studies in
light of these findings suggests that event-study methods tend to overreach
their data.

CHANGE IN MARXET ASSESSMENTS OF DEPOSIT-INSTITUTION RISKINESS

I. Introduction:

Testifying before the House of Representatives in December 1984, the
U.S. Comptroller of the Currency posed the following questions:

Is banking becoming riskier? Are large banks riskier than
small banks? What effect has interest rate deregulation
had on the risks faced by the banking system?.. We do not
have good answers to these questions.
This paper deploys statistical methods to develop new evidence on these

issues. Using capital market data for 1975-1985, we investigate temporal
variability in market and interest-rate sensitivity and in unsystematic risk

for savings and loan associations (S&Ls) and three size classes of banks.

During this decade, deposit institutions faced substantial regulatory and
statutory change and interest rates became extraordinarily volatile.

Our methods focus on estimating the parameters of a two-index model,

allowing the model to switch parameter regimes over 1975-85 in

art

unrestricted way. Coldfeld and Quandts [(1972), (1973), (1976)] switching
regression method (CQSRM) is used to determine the temporal variability of

model parameters. CQSRM employs a search procedure which finds maximum-

likelihood estimates of three attributes of regime variation: the shift
dates, the gradualness of each shift, and the parameters of the stochastic
process which obtain in each regime. CQSRM is applied by Quandt (1974) and

Lin and Oh (1984) to solve specific problems of nonstationarity and Unal
(1985) use the approach as a tool of event study.

2

The statistical findings and the analysis presented in this paper serve

to reconcile some of the conflicting results developed in the literature on

the two-index model and provide grounds for reassessing traditional eventstudy methods. We find that the riskiness of bank and S&L stock declined in

the late-l970s, but rose again in recent years. We show that event studies

focusing on the impact on deposit-institution stock of recent changes in
monetary-policy regimes or regulatory adjustments need to control for other

significant sources of nonstationarity. Allowing for this nonstationarity

suggests that at least over 1979-1982 it is rash to attribute observed
shifts in return-generating processes to any particular information event.
2. Model and Data Selection

This paper's focal return-generating process is the two-index model
developed by Stone (1974). This asset pricing model expands the familiar

market model of asset returns by adding an interest-rate index, in this
application as a quasi-industry factor. Including an interest-rate index as

a second factor could just as easily be justified by I4erton's (1973)

(1985) investigate the extent to which this model can explain returns on
financial-intermediary stock.

Using the two-index model raises two major problems. First, one must

specify whatever simultaneous relation is presumed to exist between the
variables. Previous authors deal with what is called "multicollinearity"
between

and R0 by imposing an arbitrary causal ordering. Because theory

does not impose a zero covariance, ømi between the market return and an
interest rate index, the following orthogonslization, is proposed [Stone
(lg74), Chance and Lane (1980)j.

An alternative approach is to treat

as exogenous and

as endogenous

[Lynge and Zumwalt (1980), Flannery and James (1982)]. This produces the

or an adjusted market factor;

may be incorporated into Equation (1). In both cases, orthogonal series

are generated, which eliminate simultaneity by

construction. However, as

Ciliberto (1985) elaborates, using Equation (2) biases t-tests against
interest-rate sensitivity, while using Equation

(3) imposes the opposite

bias. Either auxiliary regression grafts a nonsimultaneous
structure onto the two-index model. We would

triangular

need additional theory to

4

specify either that R, drives the interest rate, that R1 is logically prior

to m' or that both variables are governed by omitted exogenous forces.
Because

the parameter space spanned is the same whether or not we impose

either auxiliary regression, this paper employs the unorthogonalized twoindex

model.

A second problem is to select a proxy for unanticipated changes in R.
One approach is to pick an interest-rate index, estimate synthetic forecasts

xis an autoregressive model, and use forecast errors from this model as
proxies

for

unanticipated interest-rate changes (Flannery and James

(l984a)). An alternative approach is to use changes in the yield on a given

maturity of long-term bonds

to

capture unanticipated changes in interest

rates LScott and Peterson (1986); Sweeney and Warga (1986)). Yet another

approach is to proxy unanticipated changes in interest rates by the
difference between the spot 3-month Treasury bill rate at time t

the

from Citicorp's competitor list (Sinkey, 1986, p.249). Other banks are
classified as 'superregional" and "regional" banks, based on an asset-size
threshold of $10 billion. Partitioning banks in this way allows for
differences in the extent to which the nondeposit debt of different
institutions is effectively guaranteed by the FDIC and develops classes of

banks that may be presumed to operate similarly. At the end of 1984, the
mean asset sizes of the money-center, superregional, and regional banks are

$73.6, $20.6, and $4.5 billion. Sample S&Ls average $13.7 billion. Total
assets of the 31 banks and 8 S&Ls in our sample are $973 billion and $109.6

billion, respectively. Expressed as a percentage of respective industries'
asset totals, sample banks constitute about 43

on long-term government bonds, obtained from Ibbotson

Associates (1986). As Flannery and James (1984) point out, "since the

period returns on bonds are negatively correlated with changes in
the level of interest rates, a positive value for P1 implies that the firm's

value declines when interest rates rise."
3. Estiaatin the Model Over Prior Studies Observation Periods
Unal and Kane (1987a) emphasize that the qualitative force of empirical
evidence on the two-index model varies with the market proxy and the
market

interest-rate index used, the time period analyzed, the frequency with which

are observed, and the number of institutions sampled. Because our
sample and model specification both differ from previous studies, for

analyses and event studies that neglect nonstationarities caused

by variation in omitted variables run a serious risk of sorting out
empirical evidence incorrectly. Formal tests of statistical hypotheses may
develop either falsely positive or falsely negative results. The likelihood

10

of

making false inferences about the influence of included variables grows

when omitted

variables are correlated with included ones. Similarly, the

odds of observing a positive event-study result increases whenever, during

or in the vicinity of an event window, reinforcing movements occur in
variables for which the model does not control. Conversely, the likelihood

of observing

negative event-study results increases when offsetting

movements in uncontrolled forces (i.e., omitted variables) occur during a
study's focal time intervals.

We employ the Goldfeld-Quandt search routine as a way of developing
policy-analysis or event-study benchmark models that can incorporate the
effects of "relevant" movements in unspecified omitted variables.

Although

it would be useful either for us or for other researchers to identify these

omitted variables and to proceed to endogenize the parameter variation we
observe, our goal in this paper is more modest than this. We seek merely to

extend the range of experimental control to capture movements in variables

that standard pricing models omit. In principle, this extension in
control renders

technique a cleaner benchmark from which to infer the

The Goldfeld and Quandt ((1972, 1973, 1976)1 switching-regression
method (GQSRM) provides a flexible way to identify changes in the systematic
and unsystematic risks of asset portfolios. The strength of the technique is

that the number of effective regimes, the parameter values in each regime,

of regimes operative during the analysis period is found. Initially,
maximum-likelihood values for one-regime (L1) and two-regime (L2) models are

obtained using (7). The null hypothesis that no regime switch occurs is

these shifts prove to be abrupt ones and the switch dates have overlapping

intervals. At the same time,

the pattern of results indicates

that 1975-1985 information flows differentially affected different classes
of depository firms.

S&Ls and regional banks show an abrupt first switch in early 1976. (For

convenience, we term these first switches the 1976 switch).

Money-center

and superregional banks' first switch and S&Ls' second switch occur at the
beginning of 1977 (the 1977 switch).

All bank groups experience a second switch near or in 1979, (the 1979

switch). In passing, we note that this was a time of marked changes in

be gradual rather than abrupt. The switch begins 7 months before the mean

Using these

standard errors produces wide confidence intervals that include late 1981

and all or most of 1982. Even S&Ls' third switch in 9/81 falls within
interval estimates of the banks' 1982 switch.

SGrL's fourth switch falls in 9/83. Its standard error of 9 months
includes late 1982 and early 1984 in its 95 percent confidence interval.
The confidence interval for superregional banks' fourth switch is tightly
centered on 10/84.

These data support the CQSRM analysis of temporal variation in market risk.

Variation in other narameters. Unsystematic risk also falls and rises, but
for the regionals and superregionals also falls again in the 1980s. In the
first

switch, all bank groups experience a significant decrease in

unsystematic risk. However, as early as the 1979 switch, unsystematic risk

begins to rise. During the 1979-82 period of generally high unsystematic
risk, market risk and bank failure rates remain relatively low.

As noted earlier, little significant temporal variation occurs in bank
interest sensitivity. Positive coefficients occur for all bank groups during

all but two of the regimes delineated. This implies a conventional inverse

relationship between bank stock returns and market interest tates. No bank

group shows significant interest-rate sensitivity before the 1979 switch.

Only during 1979-1982 volatile interest rate era do all bank groups show
significant interest-rate sensitivity.

Our observed great variation in

interest-sensitivity can account for the seemingly inconsistent conclusions

of empirical investigations using smaller time periods and different size

compositions of sample banks. Differences in results may

trace

to

differences in the character of and market environments operative in these

18

authors' samples. Once again, we see the importance of allowing for possible
nonstationarities before drawing inferences from regression results.
5.2. A Look at Survivorshio Bias in the Money-Center Croun

Our sample includes no officially failed banks. However, the Bank of
America and Continental Illinois may be described as quasi-failures. As a
sensitivity experiment, we exclude Continental Illinois and Bank of America
from the money-center group to examine whether these banks distort findings

for this group. Table 6 reports regressions for this edited subsample and
for Continental Illinois taken by itself. Comparing Table 3 and 6 shows that

money-center banks' switch points do not differ significantly between the
two subsamples and that risk parameters behave similarly. On the other hand,
taking Continental by itself shows some substantial differences. Continental

skipped the 1977 shift and developed a negative market beta in 1979. Its
1982 increases in beta move against those for other money-center banks. The
April 1984 shift coincides with an announced increase of $400 million in its

problem loans, starting the rim which led to its de facto nationalization.
In its 4/84 shift, all risk components increase, but with only the increase
in

unsystematic risk proving statistically significant. Continental's

federal rescue appears to destroy the two-index model's applicability,
inasmuch as neither beta attains significance in the post-rescue regime.
Interestingly, in its prefailure period Continental shows no significant
interest sensitivity. As our S&t sample, this may indicate that its deposit
insurer

was absorbing the bulk of interest induced gains and losses dring

this troubled time. The plausibility of this interpretation is also

19

supported by the failure of the parameter regime for other money-center
banks to shift in the wake of the Continental crisis.
5.3

Chantes

in S&L Riskiness

For S&Ls, the last column of Table 4 tests for parameter inequality
across regimes. As do regional banks, S&Ls experience significant shifts in

market and unsystematic risk in early 1976, developing a significantly
negative market-beta and greatly enbanced interest sensitivity. However,

S&Ls show an abrupt second shift in 4/77,

one combining increases in

unsystematic risk and market-beta with reduced interest sensitivity.

In contrast to the 1979 shift for bank groups, the return-generating
process for our small sample of S&.Ls shows no switch during the 1979-1980

era. S&Ls undergo their third shift in late 1981, with market and
unsystematic risk doubling and interest sensitivity declining to
insignificance.
In the late-1983 shift, market risk declines and interest sensitivity

rises (both significantly), while the fall in unsystematic risk fails to
achieve statistical significance.
As we did for banks, we may compare temporal variation in market and

unsystematic risk with fluctuations in problem and failed institutions.
Unfortunately, time series of failures and problem S&Ls are not routinely
published by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. For 1975-1985, Table S
reports, as a proxy for problem S&Ls, the number of S6,Ls whose net worth is
less than or equal to zero under

surged

sharply in 1982,

with a parallel rise in CAAP-insolvent institutions. Although the number of
failed S&Ls

declines

significantly in 1984, a second sharp surge in the

number of CAAP-insolvent

S&Ls is observed. This suggests that the reduced

credibility. In S&Ls' fourth regime, market and unsystematic risk reach
peaks for the 1975-1985 period. This peak is consistent with S&L failure
rates but not with the trend in GM! insolvency. With only 8 extremely large

S&Ls in our sample (and most of these headquartered in California), it is
doubtful that the regression shifts we observe are representative of the S&L
industry as a whole.

Interest-rate sensitivity varies over a far wider range of values for
S&Ls than for banks. Moreover, three out of the four shifts in SM. interest-

rate sensitivity prove significant. During their first regime and third
regime when market-betas were at high levels, SM. interes; sensitivity is
not significantly different from zero. In the remaining three regimes, SM.

stock proves significantly market and interest-rat, sensitive. During the
9/81-9/83 regime, although interest rates were highly volatile, S&L stock
shows near-zero interest sensitivity. This may trace not only to a higher
incidence of adjustable-rate mortgages and to mortgage prepayments in the
last part of this era, but also to the extent of hidden economic insolvency
at sample S&Ls. Deep insolvencies could have forced the FSLIC to absorb the

21

bulk of interest induced profits and losses on short-funded positions in
long assets during this particularly troubled era.
5.4 Some Observed Implications
The observed pattern of coefficient change indicates that the riskiness

of sample bank and S&L stocks declined in the late 1970s, but rose again in

recent years. Of course our sample of banks and S&Ls is not necessarily
representative of banks and S&Ls as a whole. The sample includes only very
large institutions. Moreover, using monthly observations reduces the power
of our tests. The wide confidence intervals that attach to the 1979 and 1982

switch dates are particularly unfortunate. Macroeconomic and regulatory
events taking place in these eras call out for tighter estimates. Daily or

weekly data might let us develop closer estimates of the timing of the
structural changes in return-generating processes.

This paper does not attempt to link its statistical findings with
particular information events. Although the switches could be shown to
coincide with various information flows, without analyzing a full chronology
of potential information events and considering potentially relevant omitted

variables, asserting such links would overreach the regression experiments
we conduct.

A growing literature has sought to explain cross-sectional differences
in bank stocks' interest-sensitivity (e.g. Flannery and James l984a, Brewer

and Lee 1985. and Tarhan 1987). These studies all assume interestsensitivity is stationary over the periods they analyze. However, because

our findings indicate that interest sensitivity shifted importantly over

account. Modelling this nonstationarity endogenously over time

6. Reassessina Event Studies

Several authors use 1975-85 data to investigate the impact of selected
information events on bank stocks. We focus on papers concerned with events

occuring in 1979 (1979 event studies) or in 1982 (1982 event studies). Our

estimated

switch dates establish a perspective from which to reinterpret

these studies.

6.1 1979 Event Studies
Aharony,

Saunders, and Swary (1986) examine the impact on commercial

banks of the well-publicized October 6, 1979 change in Federal Reserve
operating procedures. Using weekly data and a two-index model, they
postulate the possibility of a parameter shift on this date. To test for

risk changes, they estimate market
unsystematic risk for the two

years

risk,

interest-rate

risk,

and

bracketing the October 1979 announcement

date. For every bank group they examine, tests of risk-parameter equality
uncover no significant change in market or interest-rate risk across the two

years.
Brickley and James (1986) investigate how modification of insolvency

rules by the FSLIC in 1980 might have affected common-stock returns for
financial institutions. Using weekly returns, and taking January 1980 as the

date that insolvency rules were relaxed, these authors test the hypothesis

23

that market risk and interest sensitivity prove lower in the 1980-1982
perio4 than in the 1.976-1979 period. For S&Ls but not for banks,they find
significant decreases in these sensitivity measures.

In the finance literature, it is commonplace to investigate the risk
impact of regulatory changes in this fashion. Among others, Benston (1973),

Miarony, Jones and Swary, Aharony and Swary (1981), Smirlock (1984), and
Laity and Thompson (1986) employ similar methods. But two problems inhere in

this approach (Unal 1987). First, precise dates for regime switches are

imposed a priori and never tested. Second, possibilities for parameter
change are restricted to a narrow subset of regulatory and legislative
"event dates." Event-study researchers neither identify nor control for the
effects of other information events that might develop at nearby dates. For

example, while Mtarony

Al.

(1986) associate their regression findings

with the Federal Reserve's October, 1979 announcement, Brickley and James

link the same class of regression results to a January, .1980 action by
FSLIC. Failure to impose statistical controls for other information events

increases the probability of falsely accepting or rejecting the null
hypothesis.

Our method does find switches for every bank group in 1979. However,

because the switch-point estimates have large standard errors, we cannot
tightly bracket the switch dates on the Fed's October, 1979 announcement. 95

percent confidence intervals of the switch dates for all bank groups span
much of 1979. We observe that after these shifts bank groups experience
significant

interest-rate sensitivity, lower market risk and higher

24

unsystematic risk.

It is striking that the return-generating process for

our small sample of S&Ls shows no switch in the 1978-1980 era.

A hallmark of the late 1970s is the many ways in which banking and S&L

sought to help their regulatees to reduce burdens that depositrate ceilings would otherwise have imposed. For example, Money Market
Certificates were authorized in May. 1978. In this same month the Fed
regulators

authorized

commercial banks to offer automatic transfer service (ATS)

accounts. A lawsuit challenging the authority of the Fed and other
regulators to authorize this and various other forms of implicit interest
was denied by a District Court in October 1978, but in April 1979 the Court

of Appeals for that District reversed this finding. Congress was saddled
with a yearend deadline either to authorize ATS iccounts and other popular

regulatory innovations or to see them lapse. After voting itself a three-

month extension, on March 31,1980 Congress legalized the

challenged

regulatory innovations and set up a six-year phase-out of deposit-rate
ceilings on time and savings accounts.

Presuming a sharp causal connection between specifié monetary or
regulatory events and shifts in regression parameters goes beyond the
inferential reach of the data actually examined. Clearly, given the ebb and

flow of regulatory, judicial, and legislative events, it is rash to
associate parameter shifts (nonshifts) for commercial-banks or S&Ls

1979 with specific dates, who

is

in

1978-

to say which regulatory actions, monetary-

policy changes, modificat!on of insolvency rules, court decisions, or steps
in the passage of the 1980 legislation, competitive developments, were more

25

important than other events? A cautious observer can only say that the 1978-

79 period includes numerous developments that might jointly or individually

have supported expectations revisions large enough to induce a shift (or
nonshift) in the return-generating processes for deposit-institution stocks.
6.2 1982 Event Studies

To put the specific events analyzed by 1982 event studies into broad
perspective,

it is instructive to consider a partial chronology of

information events that might have proved relevant in 1982. Early in 1982,
nonperforming loans increased sharply at large banks and the SEC authorized
shelf-registration. Shelf-registration promised to make it easier for large

firms to issue open-market securities as an alternative to bank loans, in
March a Joint Congressional Resolution held it to be the "sense of Congress"

that the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury stood behind federal
deposit

insurance. Other worrisome events in early 1982 include:

Drysdale

Government Securities' slide into bankruptcy by mid-May, the developing Penn

Square crisis, and the LDC debt crisis. The office of the Comptroller of
the Currency closed the Penn Square Bank on July 5. In mid-August, Mexico
declared a moratorium on its foreign debt.

However, negative information

about the value of Latin America debt arrived throughout 1982. In late
summer or early fall the Fed is said to have readopted a policy of interestrate smoothing. In November, Congress passed the Garn-St Germain Act, aimed

at forestalling the collapse of the S&L industry. The Act also authorized
Money Market Deposit Accounts and Super NOW accounts. These instruments hit

the market in December, when the Fed also reduced its discount rate to the

26

lowest level in four years. Completing the picture, we recall from Table S

that 1982 is a year when the number of failed and problem institutions
surges sharply.

Thus, 1982 shapes up as a crucial year for the deposit-institution

However, the significant shift our

methods find in the market-beta for regional banks explains the negative

repricing necessary to let these stocks offer appropriate

compensation for their now-heightened market risk.

Our statistical findings reflect the financial and regulatory turmoil

of 1982.

S&Ls and every bank class we examine experience switches in or

near 1982 that show a significant increase in market risk.

Money-center

banks and S&LS also show increased unsystematic risk. The estimated shift
is a gradual one for superregional banks.

For the other bank classes,

because observed switch dates have large standard errors, almost any date in

1982 could pass muster as a potential switching point.

The overriding

problem is that so many potential events can be identified in 1982 that it
is

presumptuous to label any one of them as the precise cause of the

nonstationarity

our

methods uncover.

28

7. Summary
Two types of evidence are developed in this paper: substantive and
methodological.

Substantively, we show that our sample of

deposit-

institution stocks became riskier investments in the wake of the many
regulatory relaxations made in the l980s. 1979 and 1982 are affirmed as

years when information events substantially affected return-generating
processes for deposit-institution stock. Bank market risk lies below unity
only during the 1977-1982 period. Both before and after this interval, bank

market risk lies above unity. Our methods find bank equity returns to be
interest-sensitive primarily during the 1979-82 era, but SM. equity returns
to be interest-sensitive during the bulk of the observation period.
Methodologically,

the

hypothesis that information flows have differentially affected different
types and sizes of institutions. These same nonstationarities underscore
the unreliability of traditional event-study methods. It is inappropriate
to designate a potential shift date without also allowing for the effects of

information events or controlling for observable nonstationarities in
returns that occur in the neighborhood of a researcher's event window.
