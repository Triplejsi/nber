Alternative Mechanisms for Corporate Control

ABSTRACT

We

examine

performance and
three

management characteristics of Fortune

500

of control change: internally
pricipitated management turnover, hostile takeover, and friendly takeover.
We find that firms experiencing internally precipitated management turnover
perform poorly relative to other firms in their industries, but are not
concentrated in poorly performing industries. In contrast, targets of
hostile takeovers are concentrated in troubled industries. There is also
weaker evidence that hostile takeover targets underperform their industry
peers. We interpret this evidence as consistent with the idea that the board
of directors is capable of firing managers whose leadership leads to poor
performance relative to industry, but that an external challenge in the form
of a hostile takeover is often required when th. whole industry is in
decline.
The evidence also indicates that firms run by a me.ber of the founding
family are less likely to experience either internally precipitated top
management turnover or a hostili takeover. On the other hand, firms whose
firms

experiencing one of

types

top management team is dominated by a single, relatively young top executive,

while lacking in internal discipline, are more likely to experience a hostile
takeover.

1. Introduction.

Ineffective boards of directors have been held responsible for many woes
of American companies (Mace, 1971, Jensen, 1986), including the advent of

hostile takeovers. The board is blamed for both failing to recognize the
problems of the firm, and for failing to stand up to top officers when tough

solutions to these problems are needed. Where the board fails, external
control devices come to play a role.

An alternative view suggests that the board serves its monitoring and

control functions effectively (Fama and Jensen, 1983). Consistent with this
view, Coughlan and Schmidt (1985), Warner, Watts and Wruck (1988) and
Weisbach (1988) find that poor performance of the firm increases the

likelihood

of chief Executive Officer (CEO) replacement, and attribute this

to monitoring by the board. Evidently, board, can deal with at least some of
the problems of the firm.

The question then is: which problems of the firm can the board of
directors deal with effectively and which ones instead trigger the external

control market? Arguably, the board's effectiveness depends in part on
whether the problem experienced by the firm is idiosyncratic or industry-

wide. In the former case,
assess

it might

be relatively easy for the board to

blame and fire a CEO whose leadership causes the company to

underperfora its otherwise healthy industry. In the case of industry-wide
problems, such as those caused by foreign competition, technological

progress, or deregulation, the board's problem is much harder. It is
less

then

clear that the fin is making mistakes â€¢ or what those mistakes are, when

the whole industry is suffering. With this kind of uncertainty, most boards
would be reluctant to blame the CEO for the firm's problems, let alone fire
him. Even when the board understands that changes are needed, it might

3

refuse

to force the current CEO (or his replacement) to divest divisions,

close plants lay off workers, cut wages, and take other painful measures
that might increase profits in a declining industry. Under these
circumstances, an external challenge to the board's authority may be
necessary to enforce shareholder wealth maximization.
The board's effectiveness also depends on the status and power of the

CEO. Some managers, by virtue of their ability, ownership stake, tenure, or
status

as founders might be able to dominate the

controlled by

it

board,

rather than be

whatever problems the company faces. If the board's

comparative advantage is to deal with certain types of problems end with

handling particular CEOs

companies going through internallycaused

management turnover will be different than targets of hostile takeovers. By
contrasting the characteristics of the two types of firms, this paper tries
to find out what boards do in fact accomplish.

Our analysis focuses on three alternative means of control change in a

sample

of 454

Fortune 500 companies that

appears to be the

best measure of forced internally precipitated change, as

opposed to orderly transitions. We do not treat ordinary internal succession
as a control change, since those do not

management problems (Vancfl, 1987). In fact, we present evidence in

studied because they too represent control changes, but not necessarily of
the same disciplinary nature as hostile takeovers (Morck, Shleifer and

Vishny, 1988, present evidence on this point). As such, friendly
acquisitions provide a useful contrast to both hostile takeovers and
internally-caused complete turnover.

We find

with poor
industry

that complete top management turnover is associated primarily

performance of a fin relative to its industry and not with adverse

shocks. In

contrast, hostile takeovers are targeted at firms

concentrated in troubled industries. While targets of hostile takeovers also
underperform

their already troubled industries, this effect is less

pronounced than poor performance of their industries. This
consistent

evidence is

with the following conclusions: In many cases, boards of directors

succeed in comparing the performance of their companies to the industry
standard,

and in dismissing management teams that underperform

the

industry.

In contrast, boards typically fail to deal with problems faced by an entire
industry

trouble. These boards are either unsure that management is doing

responding to the adverse industry shock,

or they refuse to

changes that an improvement of profits requires, such as divisional

selloffs or wage reductions. In this respect firms acquired in friendly
deals are more similar to firms experiencing complete turnover than

all, friendly deals seem to be encouraged by corporate boards that are faced

with poor performance relative to a healthy industry.
We also find that fins run by members of the founding family and CEOs

with large direct ownership are less likely to experience either complete
management turnover or a hostile takeover. Both disciplinary devices are

less effective against CEOs with strong attachment to the firm, who either

S

control the board or can better weather a hostile threat. In an additional
attempt to measure poor internal discipline, we focus on firms where the top

management team consists of a single individual. We define such firms as
cases where only one executive holds any of the three titles of chairman,
chief executive officer and president and where he is also alone in s&gning

the letter to shareholders in the annual report. We find that, as long as
such

one-man firms are run by a young top

but. more likely than an average firm to be a target of a hostile takeover.
Hostile takeovers may thus be a way to deal with these young Thosses" whom
the board cannot effectively control.

In suary, our evidence indicates that, given the current capabilities
of

boards of directors, internal turnover and hostile takeovers provide

complementary means

of enforcing maximization of shareholder value.2 Hostile

takeovers become relevant precisely when the problems of the firm and the
status of top management make the board's disciplinary role too difficult to

effectively.

2. Basic results on alternative forts of control change.
The question raised in the introduction is whether the form of control

change depends on a firms performance problems and characteristics of top
managers. This section compares mean characteristics of firms that were
acquired in a friendly deal, a hostile deal or that underwent an internally
precipitated control change. The subsequent section presents a multinomial
logit model in which all the determinants of alternative types of change are
treated simultaneously.

2a. Types of Management Changes.
The analysis in this paper is based on the sample of all publicly traded

1980 Fortune 500 firms. Of the 454 firms in the sample, 82 have been
acquired by third parties or went through a management buyout (MBO) in the

period 1981-1985. Based on an examination of the Wall Street Journal Index.
40 of those appear to have started hostile and 42 friendly. We call an
acquisition hostile if the initial bid for the target (which need not be a
bid by the eventual acquiror) was neither negotiated with its board prior to

being made nor accepted by the board as made. Initial rejection by the
target's board is thus taken as

evidence

of the bidder's hostility, as is

active management resistance to the bid, escape to a white knight, or a

management buyout in response to unsolicited pressure. We sort acquisitions
on the basis of the initial mood because we are interested in firm

characteristics that sparked the bidding in the first place. Targets that
are not classified as hostile are called friendly.

Following the analysis of Morck, Shleifer and Vishny (1988), we exclude
friendly MBOs - evidence

those

proposed by management in the absence of visible

of outside takeover threat --

from

our sample of acquisitions, since

7

they neither represent control changes nor resemble ordinary targets of

friendly offers in their characteristics. This reduces the sample of
friendly acquisitions to 34. Also following the evidence in Morck, Shleifer
and Vishny (1988), we treat hostile )thOs â€¢-

hostile

that

are defensive responses to &

bid or 13-D filing -- as if they were regular hostile takeovers. Our

sample of hostile takeovers stays at 40 observations.

Among the firms

that

have not been acquired, we define complete

turnover as a complete change between 1980 and 1985 in the list of officers

1980 also signs in 1985. An alternative way to define complete turnover
would be using changes in the list of people holding top titles rather than

in the list of signers. The trouble with following this path is that titles
can be retained by figureheads, who have no effective control or power.

Signing the annual report, in contrast, seems to be a more effective proxy

for leadership. We focus on complete rather than partial turnover of
signatures

because we are interested in disciplinary management changes

forced by the board. Presumably, most changes in which one co-signer of the

annual report replaces another represent ordinary succession rather than

disciplinary actionby the board. The results in section 4 strongly support
this conclusion.
Where

a company has experienced a management

turnover

prior to a hostile

takeover, this company is treated as an acquisition and not as a turnover.

This happens in 4 out of 40 hostile takeovers. While in these cases the
board is arguably trying to deal with the management problems, it is not

providing an adequate solution. A takeover ii still required to provide an
alternative that mimizes shareholder wealth. Similarly, if management

8

turns

over prior to a friendly acquisition, which also happens in 4 out of 34

cases, the turnover cannot be properly viewed as solving the need for new

management. Accordingly, we classify these cases as friendly acquisitions.
The

above definition yields 93 cases of complete turnover. This number

seems too high as a measure of disciplinary turnover,

and doubtless still

cases of ordinary succession. Some such non-disciplinary cases

team, but such cases are rare (Vancil, 1987). More commonly,

these would be cases where the planned internal successor did not come from

the list of 1980 signers of the annual report. Overall, although our
definition probably covers most extraordinary non-takeover-related management
changes, it also covers some cases of ordinary replacement that only add
noise.

In section 4, we separately look at the cases of partial turnover, in
which the Forbes-listed top executive (usually the CEO) changes between 1980
and 1985 but there is no complete turnover in the list of signers of the
letter to shareholders. (The Forbes-listed top executive is alway. among the
signers

the letter to shareholders in the annual report.) Our sample

70 cases of such partial turnover. Arguably, incumbent top

executives

are partly competing for their Jobs with other executives in the

company. On that theory, even replacement by a member of the same management
team can be disciplinary. Our view, supported by the results of section 4,
is that most of the partial turnovers in our sample represent

succession

ordinary

and not disciplinary changes. Accordingly, we focus on complete

turnover to gauge the effectiveness of the board as a control device.

2b. Performance Characteristics by Type of Control Change.

9

This study uses three different measures of performance: average robin's

Q, stock market abnormal returns, and employment growth rates. Average
Tobin's Q is equal to the ratio of the firm's market value to the replacement

cost of its physical assets. As such, Tobin's Q can be viewed as measuring
the intangible assets of the firm. These may include future growth
opportunities, monopoly power, goodwill, rents appropriated away from unions,

as well as the quality of management. Our measure of Q was obtained from the
Griliches It & D Master File (Cummins, Hall and Laderman, 1982) for 1980. The
numerator

is the sum

of the actual market

value of the firm's coon stock

and estimated market values of preferred stock and debt3. The denominator of

Since we are looking at an imperfectly measured Q, the interpretation of

Q as

a measure of the valuation of intangible assets can be problematic. The

replacement cost of assets could be overstated, for example, if the firm

of preferred stock is estimated by dividing

the preferred stock dividend figure (reported on COMPUSTAT) by the Moody's

preferred dividend rate for the median-risk companies. The market value of

the fin's debt is taken as the value of its short ten liabilities net of

its short-term assets (from COMPUSTAT) plus an estimate of the market value

of its long-term debt. Estimates of long-ten debt for our

firms were

obtained from the NBfl's R&D Master File (see Cuâ€”ins, Hall. and Laderman,

1982). These estimates are constructed on the assumption that all long-term
debt has an orignial maturity of 20 years â€¢ and using a matrix of bond prices
in year t for bonds due in year s from the Moody's corporate BAA bond price
series. The age structure of corprate debt is estimated from changes in the
firm's book value of long-term debt in each of the 20 previous years on the
COMPUSTAT tape. Using this age structure estimate end the bond price matrix,

cases, the inflation-adjusted historical cost is a poor guide to the true

but a

Our second measure of performance is the cumulative abnormal return over

the

period 1978-1980, calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The

data

for returns are the standard monthly series from the Center for Research

in Securities Prices. The reason for using abnormal returns is that they
capture the market's evaluation of more recent news about the fin's
current

and future profitability. Our sample using returns consists of 427

non-OTC firms, of which B7 went through complete turnover of management, 37
were targets of hostile takeovers, and 32 of friendly ones.

Our third

measure of performance is employment growth over the 1978-

1980 period. Although employment growth is not
performance, we use

it for two

an

unambiguous

measure

of

reasons. First, it is more closely related to

the business side, as opposed to being based on stock market prices. Use of
such a measure enables us to say that takeover targets are not characterized
solely by being priced by the market below the tru. value of their earnings
streams under their current operating strategies. Second, employment growth

seems like a fairly reliable measure of industry health even though it may be
an ambiguous measure of f in performance within an industry. Our sample
using employment growth consists of 449 firms, of which 93 went through

complete turnover of management, 39 were targets of hostile takeovers, and 34

of friendly ones.
Although we consider takeovers and management changes during the period

1981 to 1985, all our performance measures are calculated based on the data

11

from a prior period. This ii done for two reasons. First1 it is difficult
to find an appropriat. way to compare performance of firms that experienced
control changes between 1981 and 1985 with those that experienced none,

except by looking at all of them prior to the hazard period. While for the
sample of firma experiencing change it might be more natural to look at
performance closer to the time of that change, there is no natural time frame
in which to measure performance of firms where the management stayed intact.

More importantly, in choosing a prior period, our aim was to avoid mixing in
the effects of the market's anticipation of future restructuring activity.
Starting in the early 1980s. a large component of market valuation of many

industrial fins may have been traceable to the expected premium from a
takeover or a restructuring. Prior to that period, corporate restructurings
were less prominent, and hence it is likely that the market valued fins
primarily as going concerns under the current management. Since two of our
three performance measures are based on stock market prices, our results
depend on these prices reflecting expected future profitability under current
management, and not the expected premium from a control change.
For all three performance measures, we look separately at industry-wide

and firm-specific performance. For each fins in the sample, we consider both
the average Q of iti industry at the 3-digit SIC code level and the deviation

of its Q fro, the average Q of its industry. Analagously, we look at both

as well as at industry-wide and firm-specific

firm-specific effects is the main contribution of this

study.

We are

interested in finding out whether boards respond differentially to industry-

wide and firm-specific problems, and whether takeovers are differentially
targeted at firms with these distinct types of problems.

components of the performance variables do not sum identically to the means
of the performance variables themselves. This happens because the means are
calculated using slightly different subsamples due to missing data.

The evidence on fin-specific performance, as measured by DQ, shows that
both targets of hostile acquisitions and firms experiencing complete turnover

results on Tobins Q and on abnormal returns are also in some ways

different. First, the fin-specific component of abnormal returns for

suggest that

hostile takeovers are primarily associated with industry-wide

and less with fin-specific trouble., while the converse is true

complete turnover. Some multivariate tests of whether firm-specific

problems

matter for hostile takeovers are presented in Section 3.

The second interesting differencÃ  between the results using Tobin's Q

and abnormal returns is the evidence on friendly acquisitions. During the
1978-1980 period, the industry-wide abnormal return on these firms is +9.4%,
but the firm-specific abnormal return is -14.9%. which is different from that

for no outcome firms at the 5% level. This suggests that targets of friendly
acquisitions, like firms undergoing complete turnover of top management, are
experiencing some firm-specific problems prior to control change.
Evidence on employment growth for 1978-1980 closely mirrors that for

1978-1980 stock market returns. Firms experiencing complete turnover have
substantially lower employment growth rates than their industry peers,
whereas those industry peers grow at rates comparable to the rest of the

Fortune 500. Targets of hostile takeovers are in low employment growth
industries,

industry

and there is weak evidence that these firms also lag their

peers. Finally, targets of friendly bide are in industries with

high employment growth, but significantly lag behind their industry peers.
and

Despite the close parallels between the results for stock market returns
employment growth, these employment numbers should be interpreted with

caution. A high level of employment growth relative to industry neers

is not

necessarily a signal of superior performance, since excessive employment

growth can itself be an important deviation from value-maximization. At the
same

time, industry-wide employment growth is probably a reliable indicator

of industry health. Accordingly, our

finding

that

targets of hostile

15

takeovers belong to industries with low employment growth supports our
interpretation of the results for Tobin's Q and abnormal returns as related
to poor performance and not just to stock market undervaluation.

The inconsistency of our results for friendly acquisitions using
alternative performance variables should probably be attributed to the
different aspects of performance that Tobin's Q and the other two variables

measure. Targets of friendly mergers are often thought to have considerable
intangible assets, such as a growing customer base, to which the acquiror can

add management skills or access to capital. As a result of having such
intangible assets, these firms are unlikely to have a low measured Tobin's Q,

hostile takeovers.
2c. Management Characteristics.

Performance alone does not determine which (if any) control devices are

used; characteristics of top management may also

be

important. Some of those

16

considered here have been previously studied by Morek, Shleifer and Vishny

(1988) to compare targets of hostile and friendly acquisitions. These
include the age of the Forbes-specified top executive, his equity position in

1980, and a dummy indicating whether a member of the top management tea is
from the founding family. The equity position of the Forbes-listed top
executive, obtained from the 1980 Corporate Data Exchange Directory of
Fortune 500 companies, can proxy for both the degree of entrenchment and the

financial incentive to accept a friendly offer5. Top officer members of the
founding family, identified by looking at a sequence of annual reports
extending if necessary to the turn of the century, may have a special ability
to resist challenges to their control even without a substantial ownership

stake by virtue of having hand-picked the board over the years. Age is
obtained from 10-K forms.

This paper uses one additional measure of the status of the top

executive not used in our previous research. This dummy variable, called
BOSS, is obtained from 1980 annual reports of our sample companies. BOSS is
set equal to 1 if only one executive holds any of the three titles of
Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer that exist in the company
and he is also the sole signer

of the letter to shareholders in the

annual

report. Of the 113 executives who satisfy the first criterion all but 12
satisfy
a

the second; the rest cosign the annual

report with a Vice Chairman or

Vice President and hence are arguably not completely alone at the helm.

The BOSS variable thus tries to identify top executives who either completely

Walkling and Long (1984) find that managers with a larger stake are

construction, a complete turnover. Because we are interested in the effect

Table 2 presents the characteristics of top management by type of

change. Not surprisingly, a firm experiencing complete turnover is

about 40% as likely to be run by a founder or a member of the founding family

as a residual firm. Similarly, targets of hostile takeovers are only S5%
likely

to be run by a member

of

the founding family as residual firms. In

contrast, firms run by founding families are more likely to be targets of
friendly acquisitions than residual fins, although this result is only
marginally significAnt. This finding replicates the result in Morck,
Shleifer and Vishny (1988) that founders are harder to force out in a hostile
takeover but are more likely to sell their firms when they choose to retire
or diversify. The earlier paper did not consider management turnover.

The equity attic, of the Forbes-listed top executive works largely the

same way as the founding family variable. It reduces the likelihood of

complete turnover and of a hostile takeover, but raises that of a friendly

18

acquisition. Our preferred interpretation of this result is similar to that
for the founding family variable.

The higher average age of the CEO in firms experiencing complete

turnover probably reflects greater incidence of retirements. More
interesting is the result that the average top executive of a target of a

hostile bid is younger than that of a no outcome firm. This result suggests
that hostile takeovers might be a way to get rid of CEOs with an otherwise

long expected employment with the firm. Top executives of targets of
friendly acquisitions, by contrast, are as old as those of residual fins.

The main results in Table 2 concern the BOSS variable defined above. A

BOSSes have a radically different experience with hostile takeovers than

equally difficult to remove in a takeover. Young BOSSes in particular may be
a class of mangers against whom hostile takeovers are much more effective
than action by the board. It is also interesting that friendly takeovers are
more likely to occur in firms with young BOSSes. These may represent
situations in which board members welcome an acquisition because they cannot

work out a solution to their management problem themselves. But these cases
may differ from the hostile takeovers where the board is presumably unwilling
to condone the disciplinary changes sought by the raider.

the evidence presented in this section sheds light on the

many of the performance and management variables are correlated with

each other. In the next section, we turn to a multivariate analysis to

of the above. To avoid inducing spurious correlations

because large firms are less likely to be acquired, we control for firm size
in the logits. The measure of size we use is the logarithm of the market

value of the firm's

assets,

calculated identically to the numerator of Q.

20

Hence, all the multinomial. logits are estimated on the subsample of 371 firms
for

which we could compute Q,

even

when abnormal return or employment growth

is used as the measure of performance. Tables 3 and 4 present the results
using Q

as

the measure of performance. The omitted category are firms that

neither were acquired nor experienced a complete turnover (residual firms).
The results using Q a. a measure of performance indicate that, relative

to

the probability of being a residual firm, the probability of Ã³omplete

turnover is lower when the firm is run by a member of the founding family,

when the top executive is aged 60 or under, when the firm outperforms its
industry, and when it is run by a BOSS aged 60 or under, although the last

effect is not significant at conventional levels. Since we are controlling
for age, we are capturing the marginal effect of young BOSS only. In the
logit, the log odds of a complete turnover versus no outcome is not
significantly affected by industry Q, or by the equity stake of the top

executive. In terms of probabilities rather than log odds ratios, starting
from the 'base case in which the performance variables are set equal to
their median values and all of the other independent variable, are set equal
to their mean values, when Q relative to industry falls to the top of its

lowest quartile, the estimated probability of a complete turnover rises from

17.7% to 20.0%. The estimated probability drops from l7.7i to 8.8% when the
firm is

run by a member of the founding family. These estimated

probabilities

are contained in Table 4.

The log odds of a friendly acquisition relative to no outcome (residual
firms) does not seem to be significantly affected by almost any of our
variables, although this result is at least partly due to the small number

Consistent with
takeover

our earlier evidence, the log odds of a hostile

versus no outcome increases with poor performance of the industry

and with poor performance within industry.

This log odds

ratio is also

higher for firms not run by a member of the founding family and, albeit with

a t-statistic of only 1.14, firms that are run by a young BOSS. Young age by
itself has no real effect on the probability of a hostile (or for that matter
friendly) acquisition. Finally, the results indicate that large size reduces
vulnerability to a hostile takeover, as one would expect.
These estimates are interpreted in terms of probabilities in Table 4.
Starting at the base case (performance variables at their median values and

all others at their mean values), the probability of a hostile acquisition
increases

from 5.7% to 8.4% when industry Q drops to the top of its lowest

quartile. Similarly, the probability of a hostile takeover rises from 5.7%
to 7.4% when DQ falls to the top of its lowest quartile.

Two more results from this regression are worth emphasizing. First,
poor performance within industry is typical of both targets of hostile

takeovers and
performance

of I iris experiencing complete turnover, but poor industry

is typical only of the former. The effect of IQ on the log odds

of hostile acquisition versus complete turnover is statistically significant
at the 5% level (tâ€”l.97), whereas the corresponding effect of DQ on the log

odds ratio is not
more successful

(tâ€”,779).

This is consistent with the view that boards are

in addressing firm-specific than industry-wide problems.

Second, the presence of a BOSS aged 60 or under actually has

effects on the log odds

of

22

takeover versus no outcome. The log odds of a complete turnover versus a
hostile takeover decline. significantly (tâ€” 2.03) in the presence of a young
boss. In terms of probabilities, the presence of a young boss is associated
with a rise in the probability of a hostile takeover from 3.7% to 8.8% and a
fall in the probability of complete turnover from 17.7% to 8.7% starting at
the base case (i.e., the mean value of the young BOSS variable).
One interpretation of these results is that young BOSSes can
effectively stand up to the board of directors, but succumb to hostile

bidders. In contrast, members of founding families seem to neither turn ovei
nor lose out to hostile bidders, indicating that they are more effectively

entrenched than the young BOSSes. The ownership stake of the top executive
also has a negative effect on the log odds of both control changes relative
to no outcome, although the estimates are not statistically significant.
Tables 5 and 6 present the results of the logit using abnormal returns
for the 1978-1980 period instead of Tobin's Q.

The results for complete

turnover are very similar to those for 'robin's Q:

reduce the log odds of complete turnover

23

The most important difference in the results for Tobin's Q and abnormal
returns is that, when abnormal

returns are

used, poor performaÃ¼ce relative to

industry no longer significantly raises the log odds of a hostile takeover.
Using either measure, we have the result that, relative to residual firms,
poor industry performance raises the odds of hostile takeovers, whereas poor

performance within industry raises the odds of complete turnover. The log
odds of a hostile takeover vis a vis complete turnover increases
significantly with poor industry performance measured either by Q (tâ€”l.97) or

abnormal returns (tâ€”l.84). The effect of poor firm-specific performance on
the log odds of a hostile takeover versus complete turnover shows no clear
tendency at all.

The results using abnormal returns also confirm the finding using
tobin's Q that large firm size and the presence of the founding family reduce

the log odds of a hostile acquisition versus no outcome. The presence of a
young Boss raises the log odds

of

a hostile takeover (tâ€”1.59).

takeovers is highly significant (tâ€”2.2l). In terms of probabilities rather
than log odds ratios, having a young boss at the helm is associated with an
estimated

increase in the probability of hostile takeover from 6.0% to 11.0%

and an estimated reduction in the probability of complete turnover from 17.9%

to 9.2% starting at the base case. These multivariate results bear out our

young BOSSes are less vulnerable to a threat by the

managers who signed in 1980 continue to do so in 1985. 01 the 70 cases of
partial turnover, 54 are examples of a 1980 signer becoming the Forbes-listed
top executive in 1985, 6 are examples of an insider who did not sign in 1980
being promoted to top executive by 1985 ahead of some 1980 signers, and 10
are examples of a new top executive being brought from outside, while some

1980 signers continue to sign in 1985. This evidence suggests that partial
turnover consists predominantly of internal succession.

Even internal succession can be disciplinary in nature, however. This
would be the case if the board asks the CEO to resign, but still invites one

of the current top managers to replace him. To evaluate this possibility,
Table 9 presents mean performance characteristics of three types of firms.
These include firms experiencing complete turnover (already described in

Table 1), firms experiencing partial zrnover, and firms in which the 1980
top executive is still at the helm in 1985.

The results on performance measures suggest that firms experiencing

partial turnover do better than firms experiencing complete turnover. In
particular, they have a statistically significantly higher average Q

that

appears to be primarily a within industry effect. Partial turnover firms
have the average DQ of .131, compared to -.138 for complete turnover firms.

firms seem

not statistically significant. It is hard to reconcile the result that

firms with partial turnover outperform their industry with the notion that
partial turnover is typically a disciplinary action.

Similar results obtain using abnormal returns as a measure of
performance.

Most importantly, the firm-specific component of abnormal

26
returns is quite different for the two

types

of turnover. Firms experiencing

partial turnover have average fin-specific abnormal return of +12.9%,

compared to -7.1% for the complete turnover fins. The t-statistic for the
difference between the two

is

2.66. Furthermore, the fin-specific abnormal

return for fins where the Forbes-listed top executive does not change is
only 2.6%. which is much lover than 12.9% (tâ€”l.4l), the figure for partial

turnover firms. This evidence indicates that firms experiencing partial
turnover exhibit superior within-industry performance.

These results suggest that far from being a disciplining device, partial
turnover is more of a reward to the current management team for especially

good performance. This seems plausible: the board should be more inclined tc

pick

a successor from the incumbent management team when its operating

strategy proves successful and hence worth continuing. Consistent with this

interpretation, the primary source of superior performance is within
industry, where partial turnover firms outperform both complete turnover and

no turnover firms. This evidence supports our not treating partial turnover
as a disciplinary control outcome.

27

But the 1980s have presented the board of directors with a harder

problem. During this period, because of deregulation, commodity price
shocks, and foreign competition, whole industries such as airlines, oil, and

steel have suffered adverse shocks. As discussed by Jensen (1986) and
Shleifer and Vishny (1989), shareholder value could be raised in many of
these industries through painful measures such as restructurings, selloff of

assets, employee layoffs, and wage reductions. Despite wide disagreement
about whether there are net social gains from such strategies, it is fair to
say that shareholders typically benefit from them.

The evidence in this paper indicates that the board of directors has not
been a major force in removing unresponsive managers in poorly performing

industries. Instead, this function has been accomplished by hostile

takeovers. Our

evidence

supports the view that takeover organizers have

taken advantage of opportunities raised by the ineffectiveness of internal

control devices such as the board of directors and incentive pay. To the
extent that internal control devices are cheaper to operate and are more

conducive to long-ten planning by incumbent management than are hostile
takeovers, the replacement of the oversight function of the board by the
external

market for corporate control might be deemed a third-beet situation.

Shleifer and Vishny (1988) have made some proposals aimed at making internal

control devices more effective, and so rendering hostile takeovers less
important

for shareholders.

aBase case is where the performance variables are at their medians and
other variables are at their means. The rows following the base ease are
estimated probabilities evaluated at various points differing from the base
case only in the value of the respective independent variable.

aNumbers in parentheses are t-statistics for test of equality of means for
partial turnover and respective control outcome.

bAll abnormal returns are estimated from a monthly CAPM equation for 1/78
through 12/80. These numbers are converted to total abnormal returns over
the period 1/78 - 12/80 for ease of interpretation.
