National Price Levels and the Prices of Tradables and Nontradables

ABSTRACT

This paper examines changes in national price levels and prices of tra—
dables and nontradables and relates them to changes in variables found earlier
to be associated with price level differences among countries.
Across countries, national price levels increase systematically with the
level of a country's per capita income, and the ratios of tradables to nontra—

dables prices decrease. Over time, increases in per capita income are
generally associated with increases in price levels in the industrial
countries, although the opposite relationship tended to prevail among deve-

loping countries. Increases in income are associated with declines in the
ratio of tradables to nontradables price levels more consistently than with

the increases in general price levels. Increases in the exchange value of a
currency are also associated with declines in the price levels for tradables

relative to nontradables. Countries with price levels that were high or low
relative to those predicted by the structural equations tended to move toward
those predicted levels.

NATIONAL PRICE LEVELS AND THE PRICES OF TRADABLES AND NONTRADABLES
Irving B. Kravis
Robert E. Lipsey

The recent debates about the appropriateness of the current U.S.

exchange rate and the effects of the decline in the exchange value of the

dollar since early ias have focussed attention on the national price level
as an object of economic policy. There seems to be little doubt in the
minds of most participants in the debates that the U.S. price level,

expressed in any of the world's major currencies, rose greafly from 1980

through early 1985 and since then has fallen sharply. In other words, the
purchasing power of a dollar over U.S. goods first declined and then
increased relative to the purchasing power of the amount of British,

German, and Japanese goods that could be purchased in their own countries
with the £,

DM

and Yen that a dollar exchanged for in currency markets.

The Japanese price level, for example, is thus defined as the purchasing
power of the Yen (the number of Yen required to buy in Japan the same goods
and services a dollar buys in the U.S.) divided by the exchange rate (the
number of Yen required to buy a dollar on the foreign exchange market).

The concepts of purchasing power parity and the "law of one price" are
so convenient and so firmly embedded in trade theory and exchange rate
theory that it requires some effort to put them aside to discuss national

price levels, but the widely fluctuating exchange rates of the 1970s and

1980s have compelled attention to these issues. Most of that attention

has been focussed on "real exchange rates (usually defined as the reciprocal of what we refer to as changes in national price levels), the relation
of exchange rate changes to domestic price changes, but there has been some
research centered on explaining the structure of price levels at particular
times (Bhagwati, 1984; Clague, 1985 and 1986; Kravis and Lipsey, 1983 and

1987). One reason for studying the structural, or cross-sectional determinants of price levels is that an understanding of the levels from which
changes begin is important for explaining the changes.
In this paper we concentrate on the price levels for tradables and

nontradables, describing what has happened both in cross sections and over
time, and analyze the effects on price levels of changes in income, which
we found in our previous work to have been by far the major influence in

cross—section analyses of price levels. The role of changes in exchange
rates is also briefly described.

I. The Model
The approach taken here is based on a highly simplified formulation of

the factors that determine differences in national price levels acrc:
countries and applies it to the comparison among countries of changes over

time. In a general equilibrium setting the price level is a variable
influenced by several long—term or permanent characteristics of an economy.

Also it both influences and is influenced by the variuos components of
monetary and fiscal policy and of international economic policy (choice of
exchange rate regimes and of exchange rate levels, degree of control over
capital movements, extent of autarkic policies).

—3—
Across countries, price levels are expected to be positively associated
with income because prices of nontradables are higher relative to prices of

tradables in rich countries than in poor countries. That might be because
productivity differences between rich and poor countries are smaller for
nontradables (mainly services) than for tradables, or because nontradabl.es

are more labor-intensive than tradables and labor is relatively cheap in

poor countries (Kravis and Lipsey, 1983; Bhagwati, 1984). The relative
price of nontradables would completely determine the price level if prices
of tradables in all countries were forced into equality by competition and
if the shares of tradables and nontradables in output were identical in all

countries. While neither of these conditions holds at all completely, it
is true that prices of tradables, though higher in rich countries because
they almost always are sold with an admixture of services, are much more

simiTh among countries than prices of nontradables. Thus the ra:o of
tradables prices to nontradables prices (PTR/PNT) is lower, the higher a

country's per capita income. Shares of nontradables in output, the weights
of nontradables in total GDP price levels, are either uncorrelated with
income levels, and therefore do not affect the income-price level relationship, or are positively correlated with per capita income and therefore
reinforce the income-price level relationship (Kravis and Lipsey, 1983,
p. 15).

What implications does the inter-country relationship between income

and the PTR/PNT ratio have for changes in that ratio over time? The inter—
country relationship could conceivably reflect either the effects of relative income levels (e.g. 90 per cent of the U.S. level vs. 45 per cent) or

—4—
the effects of absolute income levels ($20,000 in international prices vs.

$10,000). If we assume that the relationship observed is with the absolute
level of income, we would expect that over time, with rising incomes, the
ratios should fall.

What implications, if any, does the inter—country relationship between

income and FL have for changes in FL over time? Since FL is defined in
relative terms (for example, with U.S. =
changes that are pertinent.

100), it is the relative income

If a country's per capita income rises rela-

tive to the U.S. its relative price level should also rise.

There could also be short-run determinants of PLs and of PTRJFNTs not
operating through the structural, or long—run relationships we have

described. A rise in the exchange value of a country's currency, not offset by changes in domestic currency prices will, by definition, produce an
increase in FL.

The assumptions outlined above imply that it should also

produce a fall in the PTR/PNT ratio because prices of tradables are more
constrained by international competition than prices of nontradables.
Although real income per capita is the predominant factor influencing

the price level, other factors may play some role. In our earlier work we
suggested that the degree of openness to trade may also influence price
levels and changes in them because a high propensity to trade [(X ÷ M)/GOP]
pulls a country's prices towards the world average --

upward for poor

countries and downwards for rich countries. And we expected a high share
of tradables in output to reduce a country's price level.'

—5—
II. What do the cross section data tell us about the relation of price
levels to per capita income?

The cross—section relations between price levels and income (i.e., real
GOP per capita) may be summarized as follows:

1. Price levels tend, as expected, to be lower in poor countries than
in rich ones. And also as expected, the differences are greater for
nontradables than for tradables.2 These relationships may be illustrated
by the data in Table 1.

The simple

between the GOP price level (PL) and

real GOP per capita (y) is .52 for the 60 countries.

2. The price level for tradables (PTR) rises as income rises, despite
the near unanimity found in the literature on real exchange rates that the
law of one price prevails for tradables.

3. The relationship between nontradable prices (PNT) and real GOP per
capita is stronger than for tradables; the ?2 is .66 for nontradables

against .31 for tradables. Also, nontradables are much less costly in poor
and rise more sharply in the progression of countries up the income scale.

4. These relationships produce a negative correlation between the
ratio of tradables to nontradables prices and real GOP per capita. This
relationship applies even to subsets of countries for which the association
between PL and PTR on the one hand and real GOP per capita on the other
hand is weak or insignificant, notably Africa.
Thus, the cross section data conform in the main to the model set out
above.

Going beyond these simple relationships in which real GOP per capita is

—6—
the only independent variable, we have recomputed the structural price
level equations for PL, PTh, and PNT calculated in previous work for 3-year

averages beginning with 1960-62. The calculations performed for this paper
are based on the 1980 benchmark data (ICP Phase LV, reported upon in United
Nations and Commission of the European Communities, 1986) rather than the
1915 survey used previously (LCP Phase ifl,

reported

on in Kravis, Heston, and

Summers, 1982).

The recalculated equations generally confirm the results in Kravis and

Lipsey (1987), as can be seen in Appendix Tables 1, 2, and 3. Again, the
nontradable prices are better explained than tradables. In the entire set of
equations, both the openness of the economy and the share of tradables in output, when the coefficients were statistically significant, played the expected
role in structural equations using then. However, their effect was not at all
as large or as consistent as that for income, especially in the later periods.

In the study based on the earlier data, we found that while deviations
from individual price levels from equality showed little sign of evaporating
even after 20 years, the deviations from the levels predicted by our struc-

tural equations did tend to diminish substantially. The lower degree of persistence of these deviations suggest that the structural equations cone at
least a little closer to defining long run equilibria than the assumption of

identical price levels in all countries. With the data used here, we confirm
these results for the floating exchange rate period, even using a single
equation for all the three—year periods from 1972 through 1984 (Appendix

Tables 4, 5, and 6).

—7III. The intertemporal behavior of national price levels
If the intertemporal behavior of national price levels could be
inferred from the cross section findings, countries with faster growth in
per capita GOP should have larger price level increases and more rapidly
declining ratios of tradables price levels to nontradables price levels.
For the period as a whole, price levels rose more in the industrial
countries than in the developing countries (an average of 1.14% per annum

in 11 developed countries vs. 0.48% in 33 LOC's). Rates of internal inflation were higher on average in the LDCs but currency depreciation kept the

rise in PL, PTR and PNT in check. For PL, for example, a 5.18% growth rate
in internal (own currency) prices relative to the U.S. was offset by a
4.68% depreciation. leaving the growth of PL at 0.48% per annum (1.0518 +

1.0468

1.0048). The prices of tradables rose less than the prices of

nontradables in developed countries, while the opposite was the case in the

LOCs. Thus the PTR/PNT ratio of the industrial countries declined relative
to that of the LDC5; this was true in both exchange rate subperiods (fixed
and floating) and in the period as a whole.

These changes do not necessarily point to the influence of income per
capita, even in developed countries where the PTR/PNIT moved in the expected

direction. The same result could have been produced by a more rapid growth
of productivity in tradables (goods) production than in nontradables
(chiefly services) production.

A direct test of association with income growth can be made by relating
trend rates of change in PL to trend rates of change in per capita income

across countries. The results are shown in Table 2.

-8-

The expected positive relationship is present for the industrial countries,
but for the developing countries the relationship is negative.

The expectation regarding the relationship between tradables and nontra—

dables prices fares better. Whatever the direction of the relationship between trends in per capita income and trends in price levels, the coefficient

for income is algebraically larger in the equations for tradables. This is
also true for the subperiods (before 1971 and afterwards) except in one of the
six comparisons that could be made.

The results above for developing countries suggest that changes in

exchange rates affect the ratio of tradables to nontradables price levels. We
tested that relationship for the floating exchange rate era by relating
changes from one three year period to another in the tradables/nontradables

price ratios to changes in exchange rates. (Three year averages were used to
iron out some of the sharper fluctuations in exchange rates). As predicted,
the relationship was consistently negative: a rise in the exchange value of a

country's currency reduced the PTR/PLN ratio (Appendix Table 7). The coefficient for the exchange rate change was statistically significant in three

out of four periods. Changes in real income per capita did not have any statistically significant effect on the ratio.

The poor predictions of price level change from changes in income alone
bring us back to the reason for our interest in the cross—section rela-

tionship. That is the expectation that the change in price level in one
period will reflect not only the events of that period but how the actual
price level compared with that implied by the structural, long-term deter-

minants of price levels at the beginning of the period. That is, if a

-9-

country's price level was "high" at the beginning of a period, considering
its income per capita and other long-term determinants of price levels, we
would expect it to fall in subsequent periods, given whatever changes take

place in structural variables. We could not find evidence for this over
short periods, but it was typically true over periods of ten or twenty years

(Appendix Table 8). The coefficients of the initial residual in the price
equation were always negative and usually statistically significant.

Thus, taking fairly long term movements in price levels, comparing them
from one three-year period to another and using our structural equations to

define deviations from equilibrium, we find that deviations from the
"equilibrium" defined by our structural equations have the expected negative

relations to subsequent price level movements. The structural equations thus
give some meaning beyond purchasing power parity to the idea that a country's
price level, and by implication, its exchange rate, can be "too high' or "too
low".

IV. Conclusion

Across countries, national price levels increase systematically with the
level of a country's per capita income, and the ratios of tradables to nontra—

dables prices decrease. These cross-section relationships carry over to some
extent to changes over time. Increases in per capita income are generally
associated with increases in price levels in the industrial countries,

although the opposite relationship tended to prevail among developing

countries. Large increases in income are associated with large declines in
the ratio of tradables to nontradables price levels more consistently than

- 10

with

-

the increases in general price levels. Large increases in the exchange

value of the currency are also associated with declines in the price levels

for tradables relative to nontradables. Countries with price levels that were
high or low relative to those predicted by the structural equations tended to
move toward those predicted levels.
