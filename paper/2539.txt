triggered by speculative attack on the exchange rate. Such spirals
do not occur when realignments do not offset past inflation fully.
The second set of results shows how an exchange rate collapse can

occur after inflation is set off by

expansionary fiscal policy.

Sometimes, but not always, the crisis will be preceded by a period

of capital inflows and real currency appreciation.

In other cases

fiscal expansion may set off an immediate crisis.
