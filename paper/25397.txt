Liquidity and Exchange Rates: An Empirical Investigation

NBER Working Paper No. 25397
December 2018, Revised May 2018
JEL No. F31,F41
ABSTRACT
We find strong empirical evidence that economic fundamentals can well account for nominal
exchange rate movements. The important innovation is that we include the liquidity yield on
government bonds as an explanatory variable. We find impressive evidence that changes in the
liquidity yield are significant in explaining exchange rate changes for all of the G10 countries.
Moreover, after controlling for liquidity yields, traditional determinants of exchange rates –
adjustment toward purchasing power parity and monetary shocks – are also found to be
economically and statistically significant. We show how these relationships arise out of a
canonical two-country New Keynesian model with liquidity returns. Additionally, we find a role
for sovereign default risk and currency swap market frictions.

1. Introduction

The economics literature on foreign exchange rate determination has not had much success
linking exchange-rate movements to standard macroeconomic variables. This problem has come
to be known at the “exchange-rate disconnect” puzzle, as coined by Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000).1
Our tack is to look for the role of the liquidity return on government bonds in driving
exchange rates. Engel (2016) suggests that this return – the non-monetary return that government
short-term bonds provide because of their safety, the ease with which they can be sold, and their
value as collateral, which is sometimes referred to as the “convenience yield” – may be important
in understanding exchange rate puzzles.2
Our study uses measures of the liquidity yield on government bonds, as constructed by Du,
et al. (2018a). These measures take the difference between a riskless market rate and the
government bond rate to quantify the implicit liquidity yield on the government bond. Moreover,
the Du, et al. measure “corrects” for frictions in foreign exchange forward markets and for
sovereign default risk.
The liquidity yield can be associated with the deviation from uncovered interest parity that
is now introduced as a standard feature in open-economy New Keynesian models. It is usually
included so that the model can reproduce to some extent the observed volatility of real exchange
rates.3 Indeed, Itskhoki and Mukhin (2017) show that this deviation is key to being able to account
for the disconnect puzzle. These models inevitably treat the deviation as an unobserved variable.
One interpretation of our model and findings is that the uncovered interest parity deviation is partly
observable and can be well-measured by the relative liquidity yield on government bonds.
The intuition for why the government bond convenience yield influences the exchange rate
is straightforward. The liquidity that these bonds provide is attractive to investors, and influences
their investment decisions as if the bonds were paying an unobserved convenience dividend. The
government bonds can pay a lower monetary return than other bonds with similar risk
1

Engel (2014) provides a recent survey. Itskhoki and Mukhin (2017) is a recent attempt to build a model to account
for the disconnect. One notable determinant of nominal exchange rate movements is the lagged real exchange rate,
which arises from adjustment to real exchange rate disequilibrium. This point was made clearly by Mark (1995), and
has found strong recent support by Eichenbaum, et al. (2018).
2
Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012) and Nagel (2016) study the convenience yield on U.S. Treasury assets.
Valchev (2017) also studies a model in which the convenience yield plays a role in accounting for exchange-rate
puzzles. del Negro et al. (2018) find that convenience yields account for the long-run drop in global real interest rates.

characteristics, and still be desirable. An increase in the liquidity yield, as measured by the
difference between the private bond return and government bond return, will ceteris paribus lead
to a currency appreciation much in the same way that an increase in the interest rate would affect
the currency value. However, we note that in our equilibrium model, the liquidity return and the
interest rate play somewhat different roles arising from the fact that the monetary policy instrument
is the interest rate ex-convenience yield. Thus, the interest rate responds endogenously to inflation
in a way that the convenience yield does not.
We find for each of the so-called G10 currencies that the relative liquidity yield (the home
country yield relative to foreign country yields) has significant explanatory power for exchange
rate movements.4 That is, the role of the liquidity yield in driving exchange rates is not limited to
the U.S., but is evident across all of the major currencies. Moreover, using guidance from a
standard New Keynesian model but augmented with a role for liquidity returns on government
bonds, we find that the “standard” determinants of exchange rate movements are statistically and
quantitatively important after controlling for the liquidity yields. In particular, interest rate
differentials and a lagged adjustment term for the real exchange rate (as in Eichenbaum, et al.
(2018)) are also important determinants of exchange rate movements. We subject our results to a
large number of robustness tests, but find the models perform consistently well. Additionally, we
undertake an instrumental variables specification to control for possible endogeneity of the relative
liquidity yields, and again find consistently strong support for the model. In an exercise in the spirit
of Meese and Rogoff (1983), we find our empirical model has a significantly better out-of-sample
fit than a random walk model.
Our study is contemporaneous with Jiang, et al. (2018), but with the following differences:
Our empirical work finds strong evidence for the role of government liquidity yields, interest rates
and adjustment toward purchasing power parity for ten different currencies, while Jiang, et al. look
only at the U.S. dollar. We do numerous robustness checks, and include an instrumental variables
specification. And, using the decomposition of Du, et al. (2018a), we find additional explanatory
power arising from default risk and forward market frictions in a way that is compatible with our

Dollar (USD).

model.5 This latter is important because the premium on government bonds is influenced not only
by the liquidity yield, or “convenience yield”, of government bonds, but also by default risk and
frictions in forward markets for foreign exchange.6 Finally, our empirical specification is derived
from a simple theoretical general equilibrium model.7
We think of the liquidity return or convenience yield as arising from the usefulness of some
government securities either as collateral for very short-term loans, or from the ease with which
they can be sold for cash. Nickolas (2018) defines liquid assets as: “cash on hand or an asset that
can be readily converted to cash. An asset that can readily be converted into cash is similar to cash
itself because the asset can be sold with little impact on its value.” But there is only a fine
distinction between liquidity so defined and “safety” as defined by Gorton (2017): “A safe asset is
an asset that is (almost always) valued at face value without expensive and prolonged analysis. By
design, there is no benefit to producing (private) information about its value, and this is common
knowledge.” From these definitions, it is clear that safe assets will be liquid, and liquid assets are
safe. The role of safe assets in the global economy has been studies extensively in recent literature.
In Caballero et al. (2008), Mendoza et al. (2009), Gourinchas and Rey (2011), Maggiori (2017),
and Farhi and Maggiori (2018), safe assets play a key role in accounting for global imbalances.
Caballero et al. (2015, 2017) explore the role of a shortage of safe assets and their role in the global
financial crisis. Gourinchas and Jeanne (2012) explore the consequences of a shortage of safe
assets for the stability of the global financial system.
Liquidity and its role in exchange-rate determination has been explored from a variety of
angles. The aforementioned papers of Engel (2016) and Valchev (2017) offer models in which
certain assets have a convenience yield arising from their liquidity. Grilli and Roubini (1992) and
Engel (1992) are earlier, related works. Brunnermeier et al. (2009), Adrian et al. (2009) and Bruno
and Shin (2014) consider a liquidity effect on exchange rates arising from banks’ balance sheets.
One can identify the notions of liquidity in these studies with “funding” liquidity, as defined in

A small bit of our preliminary findings were first reported at a conference at the Bank for International Settlements
on “International macro, price determination and policy cooperation” in September, 2017. The publicly available
slides for that lecture can be found at https://www.bis.org/events/confresearchnetwork1709/programme.htm

In fact, Avdjiev, et al. (2018) document the role of deviations from covered interest parity for the value of the U.S.
dollar.
7
Linnemann and Schabert (2015) also posit a relationship between liquidity returns and exchange rate behavior. Their
paper does not provide an empirical test of the relationship between the liquidity return and exchange rates. Their
model postulates a negative relationship between the liquidity yield and interest rates, contrary to the model of Nagel
(2016), Engel (2016), and this paper, and contrary to the evidence in Nagel (2016) and this paper.

Brunnermeier and Petersen (2009), but other work has looked at the role of “market” liquidity. A
prominent recent study is Gabaix and Maggiori (2015) that considers financial constraints that
prevent full liquidity to arbitrage international money markets. A related study is Pavlova and
Rigobon (2008) which investigates the role of portfolio constraints. Melvin and Taylor (2009),
Banti et al. (2012), and Mancini et al. (2013) empirically study of the role of liquidity in foreign
exchange markets.
There is a long history of attributing a role to the “safe haven” effect on currency values.
Recently, Fatum and Yamamoto (2016), which looks at this phenomenon during the global
financial crisis, defines a safe currency as “a currency that increases its relative value against other
currencies as market uncertainty increases.” The idea of a safe haven effect is an old one – see, for
example, Dooley and Isard (1985), Isard and Stekler (1985) or Dornbusch (1986). Here we could
argue that one channel for the safe haven effect is through the demand for safe assets. During times
of global uncertainty, certain assets such as short-term government securities become more valued
for their liquidity. There certainly can be other channels through which the safe haven phenomenon
works. Farhi and Gabaix (2015) model safe haven currencies as ones that appreciate during times
of global downturns, a concept that has been tested empirically by Ranaldo and Söderlind (2010).
Obstfeld and Rogoff (2002) speak of risk more generally, which could encompass both the
liquidity channel and the hedging channel.
Section 2, which guides our empirical work, presents an equilibrium New Keynesian model
in which government bonds pay a liquidity return. Section 3 presents the results of our empirical
investigation. Section 4 concludes.

2. Liquidity and Exchange Rates

Following Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012), Engel (2016), Nagel (2016), and
Jiang, et al. (2018), we posit that the ex ante excess return on short-term government bonds in one
country relative to another is attributable to an unobserved liquidity payoff.
In particular, let it be the one-period interest rate in the “home” country government bonds
(we present the model in the context of two countries, “home” and “foreign”.) itm is the return on
a short-term, one-period market instrument. The liquidity premium represents the difference in

5

these two rates:  t  itm  it . For now, we assume that there is no default risk on either instrument.
The empirical section will adjust the returns for default risk using credit default swap (CDS) data.
Under this formulation, we should observe  t  0 , as long as the government bond is more
liquid. Investors are willing to hold the government bond instead of the market instrument, because
the government bond is more easily sold on markets, or is more readily accepted as collateral. It
may be the case that some agents in the economy have no need for liquidity, in which case their
holdings of the government bonds would be zero. In particular, it might be that foreign agents hold
no home government bonds because they do not value the liquidity of those assets. But private
agents cannot short government bonds – that is, private agents (in either economy) cannot borrow
at the rate it , because the assets they issue do not have the same liquidity as government bonds.
Analogously, in the foreign country, there is a liquidity yield given by  t*  it*m  it* , where
the variables with the * superscript denote the foreign-country equivalents of the home-country
variables.
We will assume that there is a deviation from uncovered interest parity for the market
instruments, rt , that is stochastic, exogenous and uncorrelated with the other shocks (monetary
and liquidity) in the model. We remain agnostic about the source of this deviation. rt could be a
foreign exchange risk premium, a deviation from rational expectations, or some other market
friction. In Jeanne and Rose (2002), Devereux and Engel (2002), and Itskhoki and Mukhin (2017),
this term arises because of the presence of noise traders. We assume that rt is uncorrelated with
other shocks introduced into the model, to the monetary policy rule and to the liquidity return.8

(1)

it*m  Et st 1  st  itm  rt ,

where st is the log of the exchange rate (expressed as the home currency price of the foreign
currency.)
Let  t be defined as the liquidity return on home government bonds relative to foreign
government bonds:
8

Because we do not actually give a structural interpretation to the coefficient estimates of the predictive equation we
derive, (18), we can assume something weaker than that the noise term is strictly uncorrelated with the other shocks.

6

t   t   t*   itm  it    itm*  it*    itm  itm*    it  it*  .

(2)

Then we can rewrite (1) as:

it*  Et st 1  st  it  t  rt .

(3)

That is, the expected excess return on foreign one-period government bonds (relative to home
bonds) is determined in part by the liquidity yield of home government bonds relative to foreign
bonds. When the home bonds are more liquid, the foreign bonds must pay a higher expected
monetary return.
Now, iterate equation (3) forward, as in Campbell and Clarida (1987) and others:

 Et  t  j     Et   rt  j  r   lim Et st  k  k s1  s .
k 

We will assume that the interest differential, it  it* ; the liquidity return, t ;, and the u.i.p.
deviation, rt , are all stationary random variables, but st follows a unit root process. 9 The
unconditional mean difference in the home and foreign interest rate is denoted i  i* , the mean of
the relative liquidity return is  , and the mean of the interest parity deviation is r . Here,







lim Et st  k  k s1  s , which is a random variable when the exchange rate has a unit root, is the
k 

permanent component of the nominal exchange rate – in the sense that Beveridge and Nelson
(1981) use that term in their permanent-transitory decomposition. The term s1  s represents the
trend in the log of the nominal exchange rate.
There is some consensus that nominal exchange rates among high-income countries
contain unit roots. For example, if monetary policy is set by a rule for money supplies, any

Technically, we assume it  it* , t , and rt are square summable, which insures that the infinite sums converge.
Any finite order ARMA process, for example, is square summable.

permanent change in the money supply would lead to a permanent change in the nominal exchange
rate. If monetary policy is set by an interest-rate rule such as a Taylor rule, the exchange rate will
contain a unit root unless the interest rate rule targets the nominal exchange rate.10
Equation (4) already points to the intuition of our empirical specification. It says that when
the infinite sum of the expected current and future home interest rates rises relative to the expected
infinite sum of current and future foreign interest rate, the home currency appreciates ( st falls.)
That is a well-known channel of influence, which is at work in, for example, the famous Dornbusch
(1976) model.
However, this comparative statics exercise is made holding the permanent component of
the exchange rate constant. All nominal interest rate changes may not be the same. For example,
in a traditional monetarist model of exchange rates, a permanent one-time increase in the monetary
growth rate in the home country would immediately raise inflation, and therefore raise the inflation
premium incorporated in the nominal interest rate. it  j  it* j would increase for all time periods,
but that also implies an increase in the unconditional mean of the relative interest rates, i  i* . In
that case, there would be no change in the first term on the right hand side of equation (4):




  would be unaffected. However, this change would lead to an increase in

Et  it  j  it* j  i  i*
j 0

the permanent component of the exchange rate. The size of the increase is model-dependent, but a
classic result is that an increase in the growth rate of x percent leads to an immediate permanent
depreciation of greater than x percent, which the literature referred to as the “magnification
effect”.11 The conclusion is that equation (4) by itself, which represents the international financial
market equilibrium condition, is not sufficient to determine the exchange rate. In order to
determine the exchange rate, we need a model of the determination of interest rates, and of the
permanent component of the nominal exchange rate.12
Before proceeding to close the model, we note that a higher relative liquidity return on
home government bonds also leads to an appreciation of the domestic currency. In this equation,
the liquidity return and the interest rate are just two components of the return on government bonds,

10

See Benigno and Benigno (2008).
See, for example, Frenkel (1976).
12
Here we differ from Jiang, et al. (2018), who take nominal interest rates as exogenous and assume the nominal
exchange rate is stationary.
11

8

and so their impact on the exchange rate is identical. In the model that we now present, the interest
rates are the monetary policy instruments, and are endogenously determined.
As a first step, we incorporate the model from Engel (2016), based in turn on Nagel (2016),
in which the liquidity return on the home bond is positively related to the interest rate:

(5)

t    it  it*   vt ,   0 .

Appendix A1 derives this equation, extending the analysis of Engel (2016). The positive
relationship between the relative liquidity return and the interest differential arises as in Nagel
(2016). Specifically, when the monetary authority tightens monetary policy by reducing the supply
of money and raising interest rates, liquid assets that can substitute for money become more valued
for their liquidity services and so pay a higher liquidity return.
The remainder of the model adopts a New Keynesian framework. First, we assume that
nominal prices in each country are sticky in nominal terms. In particular, we posit that there is
local-currency pricing, so that each firm, in both countries, sets two prices – one in home currency
for sale in the home country, and one in foreign currency for sale in the foreign currency.
We modify the standard Calvo-pricing equation in two ways. First, we assume that nominal
prices must be set one period in advance. We make this assumption because, in practice, the
response of nominal prices to current period shocks is so small relative to the response of nominal
exchange rates, that a model with predetermined prices better represents reality in an openeconomy framework. A fraction of firms,  , are allowed to change their prices optimally each
period, but the price they set at time t  1 is for the time t period. Let ptr , H be the price for firms
that reset their prices (which is identical for all such firms, because as in the standard New
Keynesian framework, they face identical costs and demand functions.)
The remaining firms do not change their price optimally, but we assume that these firms
build in an automatic price adjustment. We do not specify the trend term, but impose a particular
consistency restriction below. We let  tH be the trend adjustment for home prices in the home
country (set at time t  1 .) The firms that adjust their price optimally take into account any current
disequilibrium in prices in planning their price increase, while the other firms simply adjust the
price at the trend rate.
9

We have:

(6)

ptH  ptH1    ptr , H  ptH1   1    tH .13

The foreign currency price of home goods is set in a similar way:
pt* H  pt*H1    pt*r , H  pt*H1   1    t* H

We now make two simplifying assumptions about the price setting process. The first is that firms,
when they reset their price, set prices in such a way that there is no expected pricing to market:
pt*r , H  ptr , H  Et 1st . We can justify that assumption on the grounds that it is too costly for firms

to calculate reset prices for each market they serve. As in the producer currency pricing model, we
assume that firms calculate a single reset price, but then translate that price into the currency of
each market they service. The local-currency price then remains unchanged until the next
opportunity for price resetting. The second assumption is that, while we are agnostic about the
process by which firms set the trend adjustment of their prices, we impose the following
consistency requirement:  t* H   tH  Et 1st  st 1 . That is, firms form a forecast of the exchange
rate change, and then align their trend adjustments so that they are expected to be consistent, when
expressed in a common currency, in the home and foreign market. These assumptions imply:

(7)

pt* H  pt*H1    ptr , H  Et 1st  pt*H1   1     tH   Et 1st  st 1   .

Subtracting (7) from (6), we find:

(8)

Et 1st  st 1  pt* H  pt*H1   ptH  ptH1     ptH1  st 1  pt*H1  .

13

See Engel (2019) for a study of the relationship of the price setting behavior in this model compared to the more
standard Calvo pricing framework.

10

The expected change in the pricing to market arises from the adjustments of the fraction  of firms
that reset their prices each period.
An analogous equation can be derived for the prices set by the foreign firm: pt*F in foreign
currency for sale in the foreign country, and ptF in home currency for sale in the home country:

(9)

Et 1st  st 1  pt* F  pt*F1   ptF  ptF1     ptF1  st 1  pt*F1  .

We assume that consumption preferences over the two goods are identical so that the real
exchange rate is driven entirely by the deviations from the law of one price that arise from pricing
to market. The log of the consumer price basket in each country is a weighted average of the logs
of the prices of foreign-produced and home-produced goods. Taking the weighted average of
equations (8) and (9), we arrive at:

(10)

 t   t*   qt 1  Et 1st  st 1 .

In this equation, qt 1 is the log of the real exchange rate (the price of the consumer basket in the
foreign country relative to the home country),  t is home consumer price inflation between t  1
and t, and  t* is foreign consumer price inflation. Note that because prices are set one period in
advance, the inflation rates,  t and  t* , are observable at time t  1 . Under this specification of
price adjustment, the real exchange rate is a stationary random variable and long-run purchasing
power parity holds. The pricing to market disequilibria are expected to dissipate over time.
These small modifications to the standard open-economy Phillips curve are introduced here
in order to motivate our empirical model of the exchange rate in an intuitive way. In particular, as
is well-known from Benigno (2004), price stickiness would not matter at all for the adjustment of
the real exchange rate with a standard Calvo-pricing equation, unless interest-rate smoothing is
introduced into the monetary policy rule. Engel (2019) shows how the Phillips curve here, along
with serially correlated errors in the monetary policy rule produces very similar real exchange rate
behavior as the Calvo pricing model with interest rate smoothing, but this model is more
analytically convenient.
11

The final component of the model is the characterization of monetary policy behavior. We
model this as a very simple Taylor rule. In the home country:

(11)

it   t  ut .

We impose the so-called Taylor condition,   1 , which is a stability condition in our model. ut
is a deviation from the monetary policy rule. There is an analogous equation in the foreign country,
which targets consumer price inflation in that country. Subtracting the foreign Taylor rule from
the home Taylor rule gives us:

(12)

it  it*    t   t*   ut  ut* .

We assume that the relative error terms in the monetary rules follow a first-order autoregressive
process:
(13)

ut  ut*    ut 1  ut*1   t ,

0   1

where  t is a mean-zero, i.i.d. random variable.
Equations (3), (5), (10) and (12) – the international financial market equilibrium condition,
the model of the liquidity premium, the (relative home to foreign) open economy Phillips curve,
and the (home relative to foreign) monetary policy rule – give us a complete dynamic system for
the real exchange rate, inflation and interest rates. The model incorporates slow adjustment of the
real exchange rate because of nominal price stickiness, governed by the parameter  , the fraction
of the firms that reset their price optimally each period. As Eichenbaum, et al. (2018) have recently
emphasized, empirically almost all of the adjustment of real exchange rate comes through
adjustment by the nominal exchange rate. That is, inflation rates in each currency play little role
in the expected convergence of the real exchange rate to its unconditional mean (which is
normalized to zero, meaning the deviations from the law of one price are expected to disappear in
the long run.) Eichenbaum, et al. (2018) demonstrate that this empirical regularity can be captured
in a New Keynesian model with strong inflation targeting (large value of  ). When inflation
targeting is strong, inflation has a low variance even if the variance of the real exchange rate is
12

large. If inflation does not move enough to achieve real exchange rate adjustment, that role is left
to the nominal exchange rate.
The sources of shocks in this simplified model are monetary shocks (in equation (12)), the
uncovered interest parity shocks in equation (1), and liquidity shocks in equation (5). We have
already noted that monetary shocks are assumed to be follow an AR(1) process. We assume that
there is persistence in liquidity, and that vt also follows a first-order autoregressive process:

(14)

vt   vt 1   t ,

where  t is mean-zero, i.i.d., and 0    1 . Furthermore, we assume that the deviation from
uncovered interest parity also follows an autoregressive process given by:

(15)

rt   rt 1  t ,

0    1.

The model can be solved by hand. For the real exchange rate, we find:

The inflation variables at time t are predetermined, so (16) expresses the real exchange rate in
terms of predetermined and exogenous variables. A relative monetary tightening in the home
country (an increase in ut  ut* ) causes a real appreciation of the home currency. Similarly, an
increase in the liquidity yield on home government bonds leads to a real appreciation. Note that as
inflation targeting becomes more stringent, so  is larger, the real exchange rate reacts more to
monetary policy shocks if   1   . If   1   , a larger  increases the response of the real
exchange rate to changes in the relative liquidity return. We assume in all following discussion
that both of the preceding inequalities are satisfied. Also, the greater price stickiness (smaller  ),

13

the larger the response of the real exchange rate to monetary policy shocks and the relative liquidity
returns.
We note that the nominal interest differential is simply a linear combination of the
predetermined relative inflation rates and the exogenous errors in the monetary policy rules, as
given by equation (12). It is intuitive to replace the monetary errors, using (12), with
ut  ut*  it  it*    t   t*  .

Then with some rearranging, we can write the solution for the real exchange rate in terms of
relative inflation, the nominal interest rate differential, and the liquidity shock:

In this equation, tighter monetary policy is represented by higher nominal interest rates, which
imply a currency appreciation.
Our empirical analysis aims at explaining movements in the log of the nominal exchange
rate, st  st 1 . With some manipulation, using equations (5), (10), and (17), we derive:

Our empirical specification for the depreciation of the exchange rate includes, first, an error
correction term as the nominal exchange rate adjusts to disequilibrium in the real exchange rate.
Second, the change in the interest differential affects the exchange rate as in standard New
Keynesian models. Third, the change in the relative liquidity return on government bonds plays a
role in influencing the exchange rate. Lagged levels of the relative interest differentials and
liquidity returns capture the dynamic adjustment. Under the parameter restrictions of the model –

  1 ,   0 , 0    1 , 0    1 , and   1   – ceteris paribus, an increase in qt 1 , and
increase in it  it*   it 1  it*1  , and an increase in t  t 1 all lead to a decline in st  st 1 . That is,
the home currency appreciates to correct for a real undervaluation, and it appreciates in response
to a relative increase in either the home interest rate or the home liquidity return. The error term,
zt , is a function of the dynamics of the deviation from uncovered interest parity, which is assumed
not to be observable by the econometrician. It is by construction uncorrelated with the explanatory
variables in the regression. The derivation implies that there may be serial correlation in the
regression error, but in practice we find very little evidence of that – which is consistent with the
model under a particular configuration of parameters.
Before turning to the data, we note a few features of our empirical specification based on
(18). As in our model, we follow convention and treat nominal exchange rates as non-stationary
random variables. In light of much evidence, from Mark (1995) to more recent empirical evidence
in Engel (2016) and Eichenbaum, et al. (2018), the real exchange rate is stationary and the nominal
exchange rate adjusts in the direction of restoring purchasing power parity. Relative interest rates
and relative liquidity returns are stationary. We allow dynamics by including contemporaneous
and lagged values of these variables. Because these variables are serially correlated, we enter them
in the specification as in (18) with the first difference in the returns and the lagged level of the
returns. This reduces the multicollinearity that would be present if these variables were included
in contemporaneous and lagged levels, and gives us the natural interpretation that changes in
15

relative interest rates and changes in relative liquidity yields influence changes in the log of the
nominal exchange rate.
It is important to note that 3 measures the impact of monetary policy shocks, ut  ut* , on
st , while  2 quantifies the effect of shocks to the relative liquidity yield, vt , on the log of the
exchange rate. To see this, first observe from the relative Taylor rules, (12), that the home relative
to foreign interest rate differential depends on relative inflation and the monetary policy shocks.
However, from equations (10) and (3), we see that relative inflation,  t   t* is predetermined and
a function of the lagged interest rate differential and liquidity yield, it 1  it*1 and t 1 .14 Because
these latter two variables are controlled for in (18), the independent effect of it  it* arises only
from the monetary policy shocks. Equation (5) finds t is a function of the interest rate differential
as well as the independent shocks to liquidity. Since the regression equation controls for it  it* , the
independent effects of the shocks to liquidity are measured by the coefficient on t .

3.

Empirical Investigation of Government Bond Liquidity and Exchange Rates

In this section, we present our empirical results. We first describe how we construct the
measure of government bond liquidity in 3.1. Subsection 3.2 presents our baseline result that the
change in the relative government bond liquidity returns is strongly correlated with exchange rate
movements. We show our results are robust to controlling for certain market frictions and we
estimate instrumental variable regressions in subsection 3.3. In subsection 3.4, we further confirm
that country-specific government bond liquidity matters. Finally, in subsection 3.5, we conduct an
out-of-sample fit exercise a la Meese and Rogoff (1983) and find that our model’s prediction
significantly outperforms a random walk model.
Throughout the section, we denote the foreign variable as X t* if the context is not country
j specific. For example, we use it* for the foreign interest rate on a government bond. Whenever

14

Relative inflation would also be a function of lagged r, but we have already argued that because serial correlation
is essentially zero in our regressions, the impact of lagged r as a “left out” variable in our regressions is minimal.

16

needed, we denote the variables of a foreign country j as X *j ,t , for example, i*j ,t for the interest rate
of a government bond for the foreign country j.

3.1. Construction of Liquidity Measure

The word “liquidity” appears in different economic contexts with different meanings. Here,
it refers to a non-observable non-pecuniary return that investors enjoy when holding the asset. We
measure the term itm  itm* in equation (1) by using the foreign exchange forward minus spot rate
spread, ft ,t 1  st :15

(19)

t   itm  it    itm*  it*   f t ,t 1  st  it*  it

where ft ,t 1 is the log of forward rate and st is the log of the spot exchange rate, both expressed
in home currency price of a foreign currency.
There are two ways to interpret t . First, as the term (itm  it )  (itm*  it* ) suggests, it is a
relative measure of difference between marketable securities and government bond yield in the
home and foreign country. This interpretation comes directly from the model. Second, as described
by ft ,t 1  st  it*  it , the first three terms can be understood as the payoff of a synthetic home
government bond that is constructed by buying the foreign government bond, and eliminating
exchange rate risk by entering a forward contract. Since the home government bond and the
synthetic home government bond pay equivalent pecuniary returns, the difference between the two
gives a measure of the relative difference in liquidity services the home and foreign government
bonds provide.
In the case where the U.S. is assumed to be the home country, Du, et al. (2018a) denotes
the t term here as the U.S. Treasury Premium,  j ,n ,t , which is the n-year deviation from covered
interest parity between government bond yields in the United States and country j. Jiang, et al.

15

We address the issue of deviation of covered interest parity in subsection 3.3.

17

(2018) take the U.S. as the home country, and define t as a cross-country average over nine
large markets relative to the dollar.
We employ the procedure developed by Du, et al. (2018a) to obtain  t for any pair of home
currency i and foreign currency j (90 pairs in total) for the G-10 currencies. To give a sense of how
this liquidity measure behaves, we plot the liquidity measure against the nominal exchange rate of
each home currency i and foreign currency j in Figure 1. For each time period, we take a simple
average across foreign currency j to improve visual representation. It is interesting to see that there
is already a negative relationship between the mean exchange rate and mean liquidity measure,
meaning a higher government bond liquidity relative to the rest of the G10 currency country is
associated with a strong currency contemporaneously. In Table 1, we report the correlation
coefficient between the liquidity measure and interest rate differential for each home currency i
and foreign currency j. The correlation coefficients are positive for each currency i. This verifies
the positive relationship between the relative liquidity return and the interest differential in (5),
and is consistent with the empirical findings of Nagel (2016) for the U.S..
Unless otherwise specified, our study uses end-of-month monthly data from January 1999
to December 2017.16 We use exchange rates and forward rates from Thomson Reuters Datastream.
The consumer price indexes and unemployment rates are from the IMF IFS. The government yield
data is obtained from Bloomberg, Datastream and central banks. The LIBOR swap rates are from
Bloomberg. The Credit Default Swap data is from Bloomberg and IHS Markit. The gold price,
VIX index and unemployment rates are from FRED and the government debt to GDP data is from
the BIS credit to the non-financial sector dataset (nominal value). We provide the data source
details in Appendix A2 and summary statistics for the variables we used in Appendix A3.
Supplementary Appendix A4 reports a large number of robustness checks. We employ panel fixed
effect regression in all the reported estimates to make use of cross-country time series information
but at the same time allow for time-invariant heterogeneity. To account for the possibility of crosssectional correlated estimation errors, we report standard errors that allow for non-diagonal
covariance of the error terms. We estimate the regression using ordinary least squares (OLS). The
error terms estimated from the OLS are then used to construct estimates of the variance-covariance

Whenever needed, we linearly interpolate the quarterly variable to monthly variable. For example, we interpolate
the Australia and New Zealand CPI to obtain monthly real exchange rates.

18

matrix of the error term. Consistent statistical inference (for example, significance) can be
conducted using this estimated variance-covariance matrix.

3.2 Baseline Results

To investigate the empirical relationship between government bond liquidity and exchange
rates for the G10 countries, we estimate the following panel monthly fixed effect regression from
equation (18):

(20)

s j ,t   j  1q j ,t 1   2   j ,t   3  i Rj ,t   4 j ,t 1  5i Rj ,t 1  u j ,t ,

where itR  it  it* , X t  X t  X t 1 for any variable X.
Table 2A reports the regression coefficient estimates of (20).17 Each row of the table
represents the estimation results that take the country of the currency in the first column as the
home country and rest of the nine countries as the foreign countries. When constructing the
variables, we use one-year forward rates and one-year government yields.18 The real exchange
rates are constructed using consumer price levels.
First, consistent with our theoretical prediction and the empirical results of Eichenbaum, et
al (2018), the coefficient estimates for q j ,t 1 are all negatively significant, implying that real
exchange rates adjust through nominal exchange rates. The average coefficient estimate is
approximately -0.023, implying a 2.3% adjustment of the nominal exchange rate in the direction
of the long-run real exchange rate, per month. It is interesting to note that the estimated adjustment
of the dollar exchange rate is around half the size of the average (across currencies) adjustment
coefficient, suggesting a more persistent real exchange rate.
Second, we find that a positive change in the relative interest rate (home minus foreign)
drives a contemporaneous home currency appreciation, which matches the traditional interest rate
and exchange rate relationship. While almost all monetary, sticky-price models of exchange rates
predict such a relationship, empirical support for even a contemporaneous relationship between

To keep the table visibly clear, we only report the main coefficient estimates of interest and refer readers to the
supplementary appendix for the full regression tables.

19

interest rates and exchange rates has not been universally strong in previous studies.19 It may be
that the importance of the interest rate channel requires controlling for the error-correction term
and liquidity yields, as in our specification. We find the interest rate effect is strongly statistically
significant for all ten currencies. The average coefficients, across the currencies, is -5.07, which
means that a 100 basis point increase in the annualized interest rate in the home currency relative
to the foreign country leads on average to a 5.07 percent appreciation from the previous month.
Our main novel results concern the effects of the liquidity yield on exchange rates. The
coefficient estimates for  j ,t are all negative and statistically significant at the 1% level, with a
range from -2.32 to -6.64. This indicates a 2.32% to 6.64% home currency appreciation in a month
when there is a positive change of 100 basis points (annualized rate) in relative liquidity. The
statistical significance and economic significance of these coefficient estimates are striking given
the well-known exchange rate disconnect puzzle. We find that the relative government bond
liquidity exhibits a very strong relationship with exchange rate movements for all the G-10
countries.
Table 2A points to two important aspects of the impact of the liquidity yield. First, it is not
just a U.S. dollar phenomenon. While a great deal of attention has been paid to the convenience
yield on U.S. government bonds, our regression results show that the relative liquidity yield is an
important factor in explaining exchange rate changes for all of the G10 currencies. Further results
reported in section 3.4 emphasize this point.
However, secondly, the U.S. is still a special case in the sense that the impact of the relative
convenience yields on the exchange rate is largest in the U.S. The estimated coefficient on the
liquidity yield is largest in absolute value for the U.S., and the size of that impact is substantially
larger than for all currencies excepting the Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar.

Omitting the liquidity return
For comparison, we also conduct the regression (20) but excluding the liquidity yield
variables. That is:

(21)

19

s j ,t   j  1q j ,t 1   2 (i Rj ,t )  3 (i Rj ,t 1 )  u j ,t ,

See Engel (2014) for a recent survey.

20

The regression estimates are reported in Table 2B. The coefficient estimates on lagged real
exchange rates and change in interest rate differential remain negatively significant for all country
pairs. However, the within R-squared for this specification are universally much lower compared
to Table 2A.20 This indicates including relative government bond liquidity returns brings strong
explanatory power to exchange rate determination, in addition to and independent of the traditional
factors.
The statistical significance of the effect of  j ,t in our baseline regression, as well as the
large drop in R-squared values when this variable is omitted, points to the fact that there is variation
in  j ,t that is independent of variation in i Rj,t , and important in explaining exchange rate
changes. Appendix A.3 shows that while the standard deviation of  j ,t is small relative to the
standard deviation of i Rj,t (on average across the ten currencies, the relative liquidity yields have
standard deviations less than 20 percent of the relative interest rates), that is much less true for
 j ,t and i Rj,t . The average over the currencies of the standard deviation of  j ,t is about 80

percent of the standard deviation of i Rj,t . It might be tempting to simply add together the liquidity
yield and the interest payments as two components of the return on investments in a country, but
our results show that would be a mistaken approach because those two different returns are not
highly correlated and have separate effects on exchange rates.

Estimation on sub-samples
Next, we investigate whether the relationship between government bond liquidity and
exchange rates are driven by the Global Financial Crisis or the post-crisis period. In Table 2C, we
re-estimate (20) but split the sample period into two periods, pre-2008 and post (and including)2008. We see that the contemporaneous relationship between the change of the liquidity measure
and the change of exchange rates holds in both time periods. As in the full sample, all of the
estimated coefficients on the impact of the estimated government liquidity return are negative.
They are all individually statistically significant at the one percent level in the post-crisis period.

20

The average R-squared in the baseline regression is 0.150, but only 0.081 in the regressions that omit the liquidity
yield.

21

In the pre-crisis data, the p-values for these coefficients are all less than 0.01 except for Japan and
Switzerland but both of them are still with a negative coefficient. The coefficient estimates in all
cases have larger values in absolute terms after 2008, ranging from -2.86 to -7.11. In addition to
the significant and larger coefficients, the post-2008 R 2 are markedly improved, with a maximum
of 33%, reflecting the importance of the relationship between the government bond liquidity and
exchange rate determination.21
This set of results provides evidence that government bond liquidity at the individual
country level plays an important role in exchange rate determination. This contrasts to the belief
that there is a special role of the USD or the U.S. Treasury bond. We find that individual country
government bond liquidity other than the U.S. is also important in understanding exchange rate
fluctuations.

One-month forward rates
As we have noted, in our baseline regressions we use one-year forward rates and one-year
government yields as regressors, while the regressions are conducted in monthly frequency. The
choice of one-year tenor is a tradeoff between model consistency and data availability. Ideally, for
model consistency, we would use one-month forward rates and government yields to construct the
variables. However, the data availability of one-month government yields is rather limited for
some of the sample countries. In addition, in section 3.3, we use credit default swap (CDS) data to
make an adjustment for the probability of non-repayment of government debt. The CDS data is
more extensively available only for tenors of one year or above. Therefore, we use one-year
forward rates and one-year government yields to construct the variables in our analysis. To be fully
consistent with the model, investors would need to have no uncertainty about the one-month owncurrency return on one-year bonds, but the variation in that return (annualized) relative to the oneyear interest rate is very small relative to changes in exchange rate. The monthly correlation of
one-year and one-month interest rates is over 0.90 in our sample for all countries.
Nevertheless, to make sure our result is robust to the choice of tenor, we report in Table
2D the regression coefficient estimates of equation (20), using one-month forward rates and one-

In an country by country estimation of (20) reported in the Supplementary Appendix, the maximum R is 49%,

22

month government yield data. 22 The empirical relationship between the change of nominal
exchange rate and the independent variables are largely consistent with the result we discussed in
Table 2A, which use one-year forward rates and one-year government yields data. In light of this,
to make our empirical results comparable across different specifications, we use one-year forward
rates and one-year government yields throughout the analysis.

3.3 Decomposing the Liquidity Measure

Up to this point, we have maintained the assumption that markets are frictionless, so we
have t  ft ,t 1  st  it*  it to serve as a measure of relative government bond liquidity. In this
subsection, we discuss some frictions that could possibly drive the movement of  t other than the
liquidity of government bonds. As we have noted,  t can be interpreted as the difference of a
synthetic home government bond ft ,t 1  st  it* and a home government bond it . There are two
possible frictions to consider – sovereign default risk and a currency derivative market friction.
These frictions are important in the recent literature in international finance, and there are readily
available prices that can be used to quantify these frictions.23
First, investors might not be able to construct the synthetic home government bond as we
have posited because of some distortions in currency derivative markets. If covered interest parity
held for market returns, we should find ft ,t 1  st  IRSt*  IRSt , where IRSt ( IRSt* ) refers to the
home (foreign) return on LIBOR swaps. Baba et al. (2008), Baba and Packer (2009), and Griffoli
and Ranaldo (2011) attribute the failure of covered interest arbitrage in the years immediately
following the global financial crisis to both a liquidity and a default factor. In particular, there
appeared to be profitable arbitrage opportunities that involved borrowing in dollars and making
covered investments in foreign interest-earning assets. These papers provide evidence that
investors were reluctant to take advantage of such opportunities both because of counterparty risk,
and because there was a global demand for liquid dollar assets. Du, et al. (2018b) find that in recent

22
Norway is excluded in this exercise as a home country and foreign country due to lack of Norway one-month
government yield data.
23
See Della Corte, et al. (2018) for the effects of sovereign default on exchange rates. Du, et al. (2018b) investigate
deviations from covered interest parity and Ajdiev, et al. (2018) consider the relationship between the currency swap
friction and the exchange rate.

23

years, for some currencies (particularly, when the U.S. dollar is the home currency),

IRSt  ft ,t 1  st  IRSt* , but financial institutions do not undertake the arbitrage that would result
in riskless profits. In order to earn those profits, banks would need to go short in dollars, and
purchase the foreign currency on the spot market and go long in foreign currency (which they sell
forward.) Such an arbitrage investment, while risk free, expands the size of the financial
institutions’ balance sheets, and may cause them to run afoul of regulatory constraints. Financial
institutions that held home assets could sell those and acquire synthetic home assets, but they might
be unwilling to do so if they value the home assets for non-pecuniary reasons. Hence, when home
assets are especially valued, then  t  ft ,t 1  st  IRSt*  IRSt will be high, and the home currency
will be strong. The same relationship could arise if there were default risk on LIBOR rates, as
might have been the case in 2008 during the global financial crisis. When foreign LIBOR is
considered risky,  t is high, and the home currency is strong. We note that Cerutti, et al. (2019)
associate the failure of covered interest parity for the U.S. dollar with periods of a strong dollar.
This opens the question of the channel of causality, which we address in the next section.
Furthermore, even if the currency derivative markets are frictionless, the government bond
yields might include expected default risk. If the home government bond is regarded as defaultfree (say, the U.S. Treasury bond), but the foreign government bond is expected to default with
some probability (say, the Japanese Government Bond, due to its high debt to GDP ratio), then the
difference between the synthetic home government bond and home government bond could be
different not just because of the difference in government bond liquidity but also the difference in
default premium. We define l Rj,t as the home minus foreign country j expected default loss on
government bonds, so that the expected relative return on home government bonds is it  i*j ,t  l Rj ,t .
To measure the term l Rj,t , we make use of the information from the credit default swap (CDS)
market. A CDS contract insures the buyer from credit event. In the case of sovereign default, the
CDS sellers make payments to the buyers to compensate for the loss in the credit event. Buyers of
CDS pay premium to CDS sellers for getting the insurance. Therefore, the CDS premium quote is
an appropriate instrument to reflect the market implied expected default loss. We take the home
minus foreign difference of CDS premium quotes as the measure for the expected default loss
term, i.e. l Rj,t  CDSt  CDS *j ,t .
24

To adjust for these frictions, as in Du, et al. (2018a), we can write  j ,t as a sum of three
components:

(22)

 j ,t   j ,t  l Rj ,t   j ,t ,

where  j ,t is a residual term. In the frictionless scenario above, we will have  j ,t  l Rj,t  0 so

 j ,t   j ,t . That is,  can be understood as the relative government bond liquidity, after adjusting
j ,t

for the currency derivative market friction and credit default risk.
We below summarize the components of  j ,t introduced in this subsection: 24

(23)

 j ,t  ft ,t 1  st  IRS *j ,t  IRSt , l Rj ,t  CDSt  CDS *j ,t ,  j ,t   j ,t   j ,t  l Rj ,t

In all cases, we use IRS and CDS data with one-year tenor as the CDS data is extensively available
only for tenors of one-year or above.
With these decomposed components on hand, we modify the baseline regression by putting
each of the components into the equation. Specifically,

(24)

s j ,t   j  1q j ,t 1   2  j ,t  3  j ,t   4 l jR,t  5 i Rj ,t
  6  j ,t 1   7 j ,t 1  8l Rj ,t 1  9i Rj ,t 1  u j ,t

As discussed above, we expect to find a negative estimate of  3 , because a larger  j ,t indicates
an unwillingness to sell home assets to buy the foreign currency, which appreciates the home
currency. The estimated  4 should be positive, since a larger l Rj,t means there is a greater default
risk for home government bonds.  j ,t is the residual measure of the change in the home relative
to foreign liquidity yields, and for that we posit a negative value of  2 . As in our model, we should
also find negative values for the estimates of 1 and  5 .

24

Details of the full derivation of these expressions are available at Du, et al. (2018a).

25

We estimate the regression in two ways. First, since CDS data for many of the sample
countries are only available after 2008, we start the sample from 2008M1 and estimate (24).
Second, to make use of the full sample information and test whether the adjusted liquidity measure
is important in explaining the change of exchange rates throughout the sample, we estimate the
regression from 1999M1, but excluding the CDS data (dropping l Rj,t and l Rj,t 1 ).25
In Table 3A, the coefficient estimates on i ,t , which represents the effect of changes in
government bond liquidity after adjusting for credit risk and derivative market friction, are still
significantly negative in all cases. The range of coefficient is from -3.04 to -8.91 for the left panel,
indicating a monthly 3.04% to 8.91% immediate home currency appreciation when there is a
monthly positive change of 100 basis points (annualized rate) in relative liquidity. These
coefficients are also larger than the coefficients of i ,t estimated in Table 2A or Table 2C. These
results reaffirm our baseline result that there is a strong linkage between government bond liquidity
and exchange rates.
In many cases, we also see that credit risk variation and derivative market frictions are
important variables in explaining the change of exchange rates.26 The positive coefficient on l Rj,t 1
indicates that an increase in home default risk relative to foreign default risk is associated with an
immediate home currency depreciation. Holding the nominal government bond interest rate fixed,
an increase in default risk implies the default risk adjusted nominal interest rate goes down,
resulting in a home currency depreciation.
There are two ways we could interpret the negative coefficient on  j ,t . First, the channel
could go through the change in IRS *j ,t  IRSt . If there is default risk in the IRS contract an increase
in the home IRS rate drives a home currency depreciation. Second, the channel could go through
the change in ft ,t 1  st . In the case in which  j ,t is positive, market conditions are now more
favorable to borrow in home currency and construct a synthetic home market bond than before.
As explained by Du, et al. (2018b), this could be the case that when there is excess international
demand for both the home assets and forward contracts to hedge exchange rate risk in investing in

25

In the second case, the  j ,t is effectively  j ,t   j ,t

26

See Della Corte, et al. (2018) who find similar findings of the relationship between exchange rate and sovereign
risk.

26

home assets, therefore the financial intermediaries have to mark up the forward rate ft ,t 1 , as
issuing a forward contract is costly for them. This mark-up of the forward rate then goes hand in
hand with a strong home currency that is driven by excess international demand.
To confirm our results are robust to different specifications, we conduct the estimation in
(24) by including one or two sub-components at a time. The results are reported at Table 3B. Once
again, we find the regression coefficients for  j ,t are significantly negative in all cases.
How much of the variation of  t is driven by each of the sub-components? We can answer
this with a variance decomposition. Table 3C reports the decomposition given by:

(25) 1 

var(t ) var( t ) var(ltR )
cov(t ,  t )
cov( t , ltR )
cov(ltR , t )


2
2
2
var(t ) var(t ) var(t )
var(t )
var(t )
var(t )

For most of the countries, the variation of t contributes a large share of variation of t .
However, the sums of the variance shares of t ,  t , and ltR are greater than one. This arises
because ltR is positively correlated with t (and ltR enters the expression for t with a
negative sign in equation (22)), and because t and  t are negatively correlated for most
countries. Because all three components contribute to the variation in t , it is important to clarify
the role of each in driving changes in currency values. In this section, we have seen that even
controlling for default and swap-market frictions, the liquidity yield is still a significant
determinant of exchange rates.

Instrumental variable regressions
The empirical analysis above shows a strong relation between relative government bond
liquidity and the exchange rate. In this subsection, we instrument for the liquidity returns, which
allows us to give a causal interpretation – that a change in the relative government bond liquidity
leads to a change in the bilateral exchange rates.
As we have already discussed in the introduction, government bonds are more valuable
than similar marketable securities because of their safety and liquidity. Our first set of instruments
are measures of changes in global uncertainty. In the face of this uncertainty, there may be a safe27

haven demand of government bonds which is reflected in the relative liquidity return. We use
several different measures of global uncertainty: the log of VIX, log of the gold price, G10 crosscountry average square inflation rates, G10 cross-country average unemployment rates, G10 crosscountry average square of change in bilateral exchange rates and G10 cross-country average
absolute change of bilateral exchange rates. The VIX and gold price are well-known measures for
global uncertainty. The other four variables are meant to capture the fact that when global
uncertainty is high, inflation, unemployment and exchange rate volatility tend to be high as well.
We posit that these cross-country instruments are exogenous to bilateral exchange rate movements
because of their “global” nature. That is, we hypothesize that the channel through which global
uncertainty affects the value of one currency relative to another is the relative government bond
premium.
Our second set of instruments gauges the scarcity of liquid assets available in an economy.
We adopt general government debt to GDP for each country as an instrument. The smaller general
government debt, the more valued at the margin those instruments are for their liquidity services,
hence they pay a higher liquidity yield. Our underlying assumption is that the general government
debt to GDP ratio influences exchange rate movements only through their liquidity effect. The
sample of countries we considered are developed economies with independent fiscal policy and
monetary policy, so it is not the case that there is fiscal dominance that determines inflation and
currency values.
Specifically, we conducted the same panel fixed-effect regressions as in (20) and (24) but
we instrument the variables  j ,t ,  j ,t 1 in (20) and  j ,t ,  j ,t 1 in (24) by the level and the
change of the instruments discussed above.27 We present three different specifications in Table
4A to 4C. In table 4A, the variable  j ,t ,  j ,t 1 in (20) are instrumented. The lagged real
exchange rates and change in interest rate differential are universally negatively significant, which
is consistent with what we found earlier. The instrumented change of government bond liquidity
has a negative coefficient in 8 out of the 10 regressions and significantly negative in 7 of them.
In table 4B and 4C, the variables  j ,t ,  j ,t 1 in (24) are instrumented. For the same
reason discussed above for estimating (24), we estimate the regression in two ways. We estimate

27

Whenever needed, we linear interpolate the instruments in the first stage regressions.

28

the regression from 1999M1 in table 4B, but excluding the CDS data (dropping l Rj,t and l Rj,t 1 )
and we estimate (24) from 2008M1 in table 4C, with the CDS adjustments. The instrumented
change of government bond liquidity are negatively significant in 7 out of the 10 and 9 out of the
10 countries respectively. Overall, we find that the instrumental variable regressions are consistent
with what we find in the baseline result and offer empirical support of the causal relationship that
a change in relative government bond liquidity causes exchange rate movements.

3.4 Country-specific Government Bond Liquidity

So far, we have conducted all our analysis with different measures of bilateral relative
government bond liquidity. However, the impact of the own-country liquidity service and the
aggregate foreign country liquidity service might have different effects on the home exchange rate.
We measure the home and foreign liquidity returns on government bonds as  t  IRSt  it
and  *j ,t  IRSt*  it* . Motivated by the decomposition above, we will include also the currency
derivative market friction,  j ,t . We have then that  j ,t used in our baseline regressions can be
decomposed as:

(26)

 j ,t   j ,t   t   *j ,t

We estimate the following equation with the country specific liquidity measures, controlling for
the derivative market friction:

(27)

s j ,t   j  1q j ,t 1   2  j ,t  3 t   4  *j ,t  5 i Rj ,t   6 t 1   7 t 1  8 *j ,t 1  9i Rj ,t 1  u j ,t
Estimates of  3 and  4 in (27) show how the change of country-specific government bond
liquidity affects exchange rate movements. We expect a negative sign for  3 and a positive sign
for  4 .
29

Table 5A presents the estimation results for the country specific government bond liquidity.
The second column gives the coefficient estimates for the change in government bond liquidity for
all the foreign currencies. The coefficient estimates are all significantly positive, indicating an
increase in government bond liquidity of the foreign country is associated with a depreciation of
the home currency, which is consistent with our theory and the empirical finding above. All the
coefficient estimates of the home government bond liquidity,  t , term are significantly negative
with the exception of the Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc. Both estimates are negative but with
smaller absolute size compared to others.
These results then show that our findings regarding the effect of the relative liquidity
returns on exchange rates are, for each country, driven at least in part by the liquidity return of that
country. That is, the effects on exchange rates of the relative liquidity returns are not all determined
by liquidity returns in one or a few larger countries.
We provide further evidence that our findings are not driven by one or a few countries by
performing our baseline regression (20) country-by-country. Table 5B provides a summary of
those regression results. (We report all 45 country-by-country regressions in the Supplementary
Appendix.) For the analysis that uses the entire 1999-2017 sample, among the 45 country pairs,
37 country pairs have coefficients on t that are negatively statistically different from zero at the
10% level. We find that 42 of the 45 pairs have a negatively significant coefficient on itR at the
1% level. This evidence makes manifest that our results are not driven by a single country.
Country-by-country regressions also allow the coefficients to be unconstrained and leave room for
higher explanatory power. While the median adjusted R-squared of the full sample regressions
(17%) is close to the average R-squared of the panel regressions, the maximum adjusted R-squared
is 33% for the full sample and 49% post-2008 (in both cases for the AUD-JPY pair).

3.5 Out-of-sample fit

The influential work by Meese and Rogoff (1983) shows that standard macroeconomic
exchange rate models, even with the aid of ex post data on the fundamentals, forecast exchange
rates at short to medium horizons no better than a random walk. In this subsection, we conduct an

30

out-of-sample forecasting exercise as in Meese and Rogoff (1983) and find that our empirical
model significantly outperforms the random walk prediction.
We estimate (21), the model with only interest rate differential and the lagged real
exchange rate as explanatory variables, and (20), the empirical model that also includes the
liquidity return, using a rolling regression approach.28 We first use the sample from 1999M1 to
2007M12 for the estimation of regression coefficients. The rolling window is therefore 108 months
and the forecast horizon is one month. The first prediction is 2008M1 and the last prediction is
2017M12. We then compare the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of these models verse the RMSE
of a random walk no change prediction ( sˆ RW
j ,t  0 ). As in the Meese-Rogoff exercise, we use
actual realized values of the right-hand-side variables to generate the forecasts.
Table 6 reports the RMSEs of the predictions of models (20), (21) and the random walk
prediction. The RMSEs of forecasts from (20) and (21) are lower than the RMSEs of the random
walk prediction in 9 out of the 10 countries. We are also interested in testing whether these
differences in RMSEs are statistically significant. We adopt the test statistics by Diebold and
Mariano (1995) and West (1996) (DMW) which tests the following three null hypothesis: A)
mean-square-error (MSE) of the prediction model (21) and the random walk model are equal, B)
MSE of the prediction model (20) and the random walk model are equal and C) MSE of the
prediction model (21) and MSE of the prediction model (20) are equal. The DMW statistics are
reported in column (5)-(7) in Table 6. Since model (20) nests model (21) and the random walk
model, Clark and West (2006) shows that the DMW test statistic should be corrected to account
for the fact the regression coefficients are estimated. The Clark-West adjusted test statistic (CW
statistics) is asymptotically standard normal and suitable for usual statistics inference. We report
the CW statistics and the corresponding p-value of the one-sided alternative test in columns (8)(14). We find that the prediction model (21), which includes only the lagged real exchange rate
and the interest-rate differential, performs significantly better than random walk in 9 out of the 10
cases (p-values in column (9).) We find the baseline model with liquidity returns, (20),
outperforms the random walk model in all cases (p values in column (12).) In all cases, we find
that the MSE of model (20) are significantly lower than model (21) (p-values in column (14).)

28

We also estimate using a recursive regression approach. The results are robustness to the recursive specification
and are reported in the Supplementary Appendix.

31

Thus, the random-walk model and the model that does not include liquidity returns are rejected in
favor of our baseline model for all currencies using the Meese-Rogoff criterion.

Switzerland, January 2015
The model with the liquidity yield included significantly outperforms the random walk
model and the traditional model for all currencies, but the RMSE for both the liquidity model and
the traditional model are higher than the random walk for the single exception of Switzerland.29 If
we eliminate one month from the Swiss sample, January 2015, the models also have lower RMSEs
than the random walk.
Until that month, the Swiss National Bank had been trying to keep the Swiss franc from
appreciating, setting very low interest rates and engaging in massive foreign exchange intervention
to keep a ceiling on the value of the franc of CHF1.20 per euro. The SNB lifted the cap in January
2015, which led to a very large franc appreciation that month, despite the low Swiss interest rates.
The model performs poorly in that month because the low interest rates should have led to a
depreciation of the franc, as the SNB desired.30
In fact, all of our results reported in previous table are improved, sometimes markedly, for
the Swiss franc if that one month is eliminated from the sample. It is an extreme outlier. The
absolute value of the change in the log of the exchange rate during that month is much greater than
for any currency during any month, and it is also a month in which Swiss interest rates were at
extremely low values. In particular, in a few of the regressions reported above, the sign on the
interest differential was positive rather than negative for Switzerland, but that anomaly disappears
when January, 2015 is dropped from the sample.

4. Conclusions

Our empirical findings are good news for macroeconomic models of exchange rates. The
government liquidity yield is the “missing link” in exchange rate determination. Not only do we
find that liquidity yields are a significant determinant of exchange rate movements for all of the

29

Note that because the CW statistic takes into account estimation error, both models are found to have a significantly
better fit than the random walk, even including January 2015, even though their RMSEs are higher than the random
walk model’s RMSE.

In the Supplementary Appendix, we report the results with the extreme outlier in January 2015 dropped.

largest countries, but we also find that with these included, traditional determinants of exchange
rate movements are also important. Our simple regressions have high R-squared values, so can
account for a large fraction of exchange rate movements. In short, exchange rates are not so
disconnected after all.

Appendix A1 Derivation of Model of Liquidity Returns
Consider first the problem of the home-country investor. As in Krishnamurthy and VissingJorgensen (2012), Nagel (2016) and Engel (2016), we take a very simple approach to modeling
the liquidity service of some assets, by including them in the utility function. In particular, we
assume home households maximize:

There are six assets in the world economy:

M t - home country money
M t* - foreign country money

Bt - home country government bonds
Bt* - foreign country government bonds
Btm- home country “market” bonds

Bt*m - foreign country “market” bonds
The H subscript in the asset holdings refers to home country holdings of each asset, while F will
denote foreign country holdings.

ct ( ct* ) is home (foreign) country consumption.

54

The utility function for the home household shows that it may get liquidity services from
home money, home government bonds and foreign government bonds. Below we will specify that
holdings of each of these assets must be weakly positive. We will assume that the supplies of the
assets and the parameterization of the utility function is such that the home household will always
hold home money and government bonds and get liquidity services from those assets, but it may
hold a zero amount of foreign government bonds in equilibrium. The utility function v . is
assumed to be strictly concave, but Inada conditions do not hold for the foreign government bond,
so its holdings may be zero. An example of such a utility function, which we will use illustratively
below is:

where we assume   1 ,   0 , 0    1 , 0    1 ,   0 .
This specification is a slight generalization of that of Nagel (2016) because we assume that
there are two non-money assets that might deliver liquidity services. In addition, Nagel assumes
that the liquidity from money and domestic government bonds are perfect substitutes (though
bonds provide less liquidity per currency unit), while we allow imperfect substitution.
The period-by-period budget constraint is given by

(A.30)

Households maximize (A.28) subject to (A.30), and to the constraints MH,t  0 , BH ,t  0
*
and BH ,t  0 . These latter constraints mean that households are unable to issue securities with the

same liquidity properties as government securities.
We will assume, for convenience, that as in the New Keynesian model in the paper, goods
prices in each currency are known one period in advance. The first-order conditions are given by:

The foreign household’s problem is symmetric. For convenience, we assume they have the
same utility function for consumption as home households. The utility function for liquidity is
symmetric to the home household’s, with foreign assets taking the place of home assets. In the

If we maintain the assumption of rational expectations and no market frictions, then the assumption
that the conditional distribution of exchange rates and consumption is jointly lognormal, we can
derive

(A.42)

where rt 

rt be interpreted

as a time-varying risk premium. It may arise for other reasons as well, such as financial market or
expectational frictions, or from the presence of noise traders. While we derived (A.42) from (A.33)

57

and (A.35), it is straightforward to check that equations (A.39) and (A.41) imply the same
relationship.31
Assume equations (A.31) and (A.32) hold with equality, so that the home agent holds
positive amounts of home money and home government bonds. (A.33) implies:

(A.43)

 Et u   ct 1  

Substitute this into (A.32), and cancel terms to get:

The model in the text approximates this equation around a steady state in which

it  0 , to arrive

at
31

These relationships are well-known in the literature. See the survey of Engel (2014) for example.

58

itm  it  it
We will have   0 if

vM  vB in the steady state, so the liquidity value of money exceeds that of

home government bonds. Taking the analogous set of relationships for the foreign country, and
assuming  

v **
vB
 * B * (the overbar indicates the functions are evaluated at the steady
vM  v B vM *  v B*

state levels of the assets) we find:

i

m

 it    itm*  it*  =   it  it*  .

If we had added a shock to liquidity preferences as in Engel (2016), we would then, using (A.42)
arrive exactly at the model given in the text, in which

it*  Et st 1  st  it  t  rt ,
where t   itm  it    itm*  it*     it  it*   vt .
Note that if the home household holds the foreign government bond, we have:

Our model implies that if home households hold both government bonds, the difference in the
expected rates of return reflects the difference in the liquidity services that the two bonds provide
to home households. If the foreign government bond pays a higher monetary return, it must provide
a lower liquidity return to the home household in equilibrium.
For the utility function given in (A.29), we can derive that the liquidity premium from the
right-hand-side of equation (A.45) is given by:
