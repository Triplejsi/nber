Product Deveh.pment and International Trade

ABSTRACT

We develop a multi-country, dynamic general equilibrium model of product
innovation and international trade to study the creation of comparative
advantage through research and development and the evolution of world trade
over time In our model, firms must incur resource costs to introduce new
products and forward-looking potential producers conduct R&D and enter the
product market whenever profit opportunities exist. Trade has both ifltraindustry and inter-industry components, and the different incentives that face
agents in different countries for investment and savings decisions give rise
to intertemporal trade. We derive results on the dynamics of trade patterns
and trade volume, and on the temporal emergence of multinational corporations.

Introduction
International economists have long used static models of comparative

advantage and (more recently; scale economies to great advantage in studying
the pattern of international trade and the normative properties of trading
equilibria.

But increasingly, many issues of concern to theorists and casual

observers alike are inherently dynamic in nature.

Attention has focused on

such topics as the creation of comparative advantage by technological
cnnovation, the relationship between trade policy and economic growth, and the
dynamic evolution of the volume and pattern of world trade.

The static models

of international trade must be extended if we are to deal with these new
concerns
In this paper, we develop a multi-country, dynamic, general equilibrium
model of product innovation and international trade to study the creation of
comparative advantage through research and development, and the evolution of
world trade over time.

Our model builds upon the static analyses of trade in

differentiated products by Krugman (1979a, 1981), Dixit and Norman (1980), and
Feenstra and Judd (1982), as well as the closed-economy dynamic model of
product development studied by Judd (1985).

In our model, firms incur resource Costs to introduce new products.
Forward-looking potential producers conduct R&D and enter the product market
whenever profit opportunities exist.

New products substitute imperfectly for

old, and prices, interest rates, and the pattern of trade evolve over time as

more commodities become available for purchase.
and inter-industry

Trade has both intra-industry

components, with the former governed by R&D expenditures and

the latter by resource endowments.

The incentives that face agents in

different countries for investment and savings decisions give rise to
intertemporal trade.

The approach adopted here differs in important respects from

several

recent studies of the dynamics of trade with product innovation, such as
Krugman (1979b), Dollar (1986), Jensen and Thursby (1987) and Segerstrom et.ai.
These papers have provided useful insights into the evolution of the

But all have been incomplete in important ways, be it due to

lack of explicit treatment of

all general equilibrium interactions, the

lack of explicit modelling of the economic factors that drive the rate of
product innovation, or other features. We believe that in order to study the
evolution

of trade that is based on technological innovation it is necessary to

develop models in which the process of innovation, the incentive to invest in
R&D, and the interaction of these two with resource allocation, both temporal
and intertemporal, are all treated explicitly.
The organization of the paper and some of the major results are as

This is true despite the fact that the human-capital rich country

and

The

model predicts a rising share of trade in world GNP, at least when R&D is the
most human-capital intensive of the three activities.

Concerning

intertemporal

trade, we show that the human—capital rich country has both a greater incentive

to invest and a greater incentive to save (per capita), the latter due to its
declining relative factor income

Consequently, it appears that this country

may run either a surplus or a deficit on current account in the dynamic
equilibrium.

In Section 4, we introduce the possibility of multinational corporations
in the manner of Helpman (1984, and Helpman and Krugman (1985, Chp. 12).

remain active thereafter.

2.

A Dynamic Model of R&D
We consider an environment in which there are three activities:

the

production of a traditional cnmmndity, the production of a continuum of
varieties of a "modern" industrial product, and research and development (R&D)
that leads to the acquisition of the know-how needed to produce new brands of
the industrial good.

At every point in time there exists a given (measure of the) number of
varieties that were developed in the past.
in oligopnlistic

Producers of these varieties engage

competitinn by setting prices.

Given demsnds and costs, this

-4proce.s determines prices, outputs, and current operating profits.• An
entrepreneur who contemplates developing a new brand can calculate the fiture
stream of operating profits that will be captured. Re chooses to develop the
brand only if the present value of this stream is at least as large as the cost

of R&D. The competitive entry procesa lead. to aggregate investment in R&D
such that a brand's development cost is just equal to the present value of its
future profits (unless no further products are developed).
As

in

Relpman and trugman (1985),

it proves convenient to solve for the

"integrated world equilibrium", i.e. the equilibria that would obtain in the
absence of any international borders. Under conditiona that give rise to
factor price equalization, a world trading eqillibriun reproduces the
integrated equilibrium in its essential details. g0 properties of the latter
equilibria can be applied to the analysis of the former. For this reason the

In deriving our comparative statics results, we have assumed that full
employment of both factors obtains all along the equilibrium trajectory As is
well known, even in static models, full employment is not guaranteed for
fixed-coefficient production functions. In the steady state of our dynamic
system we have an essentially-static two—sector model (because R&D is zero)
with a piecewise—linear, kinked transformation curve. Full employment then
requires restrictions on the parameters of the utility function so that the
slope of the indifference curve at the kink, adjusted for the degree of
monopoly power 1/a, falls between the slopes of the flat portions of the
transformation sue. Put differently, full employment obtains in the steady
state if for
the solution to the system of equations (7), (10), (12), (14),
(16), (17) and (18) yields non—negative factor rewards. We also require
non—negative values of the factor rewards when the system is solved with
EE(0). These two conditions at the endpoints ensure full employment and
non-negative factor rewards along the entire equilibrium trajectory, since the

Each such point can be viewed as an allocation of some factors to

industry y and some factors to the combined activity of development and
production of x-sector goods.

The latter composite activity requires factors

in proportions intermediate to the requirements for the two component
activities,

It follows that, if it is feasible to decompose the employment

vectors of the integrated economy corresponding to the initial allocation and
the steady-state allocation, then it will also be possible to do so for all
times between these extremes.

A sufficient condition for factor price

equalization to obtain all along the path of the trade equilibrium is that the

human capital-to—labor ratios of the two countries be bounded by the factor
intensities of (i) the less human-capital intensive activity among R&D and

We must show further that this proposed allocation of resources to the
production of industrial goods in each country is consistent with the number of
products previously developed there, since outputs of all varieties are equal

indeed satisfied for the proposed decomposition.

In each country,

Proposition 2:

The humsn-capital rich country imports the labor intensive

traditionsl good y at every moment in time.

It is not surprising, of course, that factor endowments should play a major
role in determining the pattern of trade in good y.

What is surprising,

perhaps, is thst neither the diversion of resources to R&D, nor the existence

of aggregate trade imbalances can upset the strong prediction of the
Heckscher-Ohlin

theorem at any point along the equilibrium path.

We establish a similar result for trade in differentiated products.

Each

differentiated product is manufactured in only one country, yet each is
consumed world-wide, so the pattern of trade in the individusi products is
clear-cut.

The existence of such intra—inudstry trade features prominently in

the static models of trade with increasing returns to scale.

1ultinational Corporations
Our analysis of the trade equilibrium has relied upon the assumption that

every brand has to be produced in the country in which it was developed.

This

requirement xcludes the possibility of licensing and the existence of

multnationa1 corporations.

Naturally, under the conditions of the previous

section, entrepreneurs have no .ncentrve to license and firms have no incentsve

to become multinational.

In terms of Figure 2, this means that point F is above the

Then the integrated equilibrium cannot Oe reproduced without

licensing or the emergence of multinationals.

In what follows we explore the

latter possibility.
Following Helpman (1984), assume that production of a variety consists of
two activities that can be decomposed, such that headquarter services can be
located in one country while actual production takes place in another.

For

simplicity assume that headquarter services are produced with human capital and
that production plants use these services and unskilled labor only.'2

Suppose

also that headquarter services have to be produced in the country in which a
brand was developed.

Than the integrated equilibrium can be reproduced even

when the endowment point E is above

It is easy to see bow the analysis is modified when both activities

The framework that we have developed is suitable for the study of
additional issues.

The analysis here excludes factor accumulation to focus

attention sharply on growth due to product innovation.

In future work, we hope

to incorporate accumulation as an alternative vehicle for investment.

This

technological progress as sources of growth, and to derive the conditions under
