Good Carry, Bad Carry

NBER Working Paper No. 25420

JEL No. C23,C53,G11
ABSTRACT
We distinguish between ”good” and ”bad” carry trades constructed from G-10 currencies. The
good trades exhibit higher Sharpe ratios and sometimes positive return skewness, in contrast to
the bad trades that have both substantially lower Sharpe ratios and highly negative return
skewness. Surprisingly, good trades do not involve the most typical carry currencies like the
Australian dollar and Japanese yen. The distinction between good and bad carry trades
significantly alters our understanding of currency carry trade returns, and invalidates, for
example, explanations invoking return skewness and crash risk.

Introduction
The currency carry trade, which goes long (short) currencies with high (low) yields continues to attract

much research attention, as it has been shown to earn high Sharpe ratios, while its returns are largely uncorrelated with standard systematic risks (e.g., Burnside, Eichenbaum, Kleshchelski, and Rebelo (2011),
Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan (2011)). Prototypical carry currencies among the liquid G-10 currencies are the Swiss franc (CHF) and Japanese yen (JPY), which almost always exhibit the lowest yields
and hence a typical G-10 carry trade would short them, and the New Zealand dollar (NZD) and Australian
dollar (AUD), which typically have the highest yields and would be held long. These four currencies
feature prominently in extant explanations of the returns of the carry trade. One such explanation invokes
crash risk (e.g. Brunnermeier, Nagel, and Pedersen (2009)) and thus relies implicitly on the fact that JPY
and AUD provide the most ”skewed” return perspectives from the view point of a US investor. Another is
based on the differential exposure to global productivity shocks of producers of final goods, such as Japan
and Switzerland, versus commodity producers, such as Australia and New Zealand (Ready, Roussanov,
and Ward (2017)).
While the prior literature takes for granted that the prototypical carry currencies1 drive carry trade
profitability, we document the existence of ”good” and ”bad” currency carry trades. We consider an
investor who sequentially tests whether reducing the set of G-10 currencies improves the historical Sharpe
ratio, and then implements equally weighted carry trades with fewer currencies. We find that such trades
improve the return profile (in terms of both Sharpe ratio and skewness) relative to the carry trade which
employs all G-10 currencies, and denote them as ”good” carry trades. Most surprisingly, these good trades
almost never include the AUD and JPY, or the NOK - another commodity currency. Next, we construct
1 To

clarify terminology, we note that a key component of the return of a carry trade is the interest rate (or forward) differential between the investment and funding currencies that are long and short in the trade, respectively. This component is
often, even if perhaps confusingly, referred to as ”carry”, and we also follow this tradition, for brevity. For the same reason we
also sometimes refer to ”carry currencies”, ”carry profitability”, ”carry returns”, etc., instead of ”carry trade currencies”, ”carry
trade profitability” and ”carry trade returns”. The context is clear in all these cases, and should allow no ambiguity.

carry trades using fixed subsets of the G-10 currencies over the full sample, and find that trades involving
only the prototypical currencies have lower Sharpe ratios and more negatively skewed returns. We denote
them as ”bad” carry trades. The trades using the remaining currencies preserve the desirable features of
”good” carry trades.
Providing a first glimpse on the issue, Figure 1 contrasts the return properties of carry trades that involve various subsets of the G-10 currencies. In particular, the figure plots (with black dots) the skewness
versus Sharpe ratio for all carry trades constructed from five currencies that use three of the prototypical
currencies (AUD, CHF and JPY), together with any possible pair from the remaining seven currencies.
The currencies enter each trade with equal weights, as is common in the literature and finance industry.
Strikingly, these 21 trades show worse Sharpe ratios, and also substantially lower skewness than the strategy that uses all G-10 currencies (denoted with the horizontal and vertical lines in the graph). Therefore,
trades constructed predominantly from the prototypical carry currencies appear to be ”bad” carry trades.
We subsequently refer to the trade from all G-10 currencies as ”standard carry” and denote it as SC.
Probing further, Figure 1 also displays (with unfilled circles) the skewness versus Sharpe ratio of the
complements of the previous 21 carry trades, which are constructed with the remaining five currencies in
each case, again with equal weights. It is noteworthy that 14 out of the 21 complement trades feature higher
Sharpe ratios than that of the standard carry (SC) trade (in one case almost double that ratio), and 16 show
higher (less negative or positive) skewness. Furthermore, half of the complement trades improve both on
the skewness and Sharpe ratio of the SC trade, qualifying them as ”good” carry trades. These findings
cast doubt on efforts to explain carry trade returns by focusing on properties of the prototypical carry
currencies, and undermine the practice of associating the carry trade predominantly with such currencies.
In Section IV we investigate the ability of good carry trades to function as risk factors for certain cross
sections of currency returns (see, e.g. Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan (2011) and Menkhoff, Sarno,

2

Schmeling, and Schrimpf (2012)). We find that good carry trades perform at least as well as previously
suggested currency market risk factors, and sometimes drive out such factors in a horse race. We also
re-examine the predictability findings in Bakshi and Panayotov (2013) and Ready et al. (2017), and find
that previously identified carry return predictors strongly predict the returns of bad, but not of good carry
trades. In Section V we revisit several interpretations of carry returns that have been advanced in the recent
literature, including the explanatory ability of factor models with equity market risk factors, a crash risk
explanation of their returns as in Brunnermeier et al. (2009), and the peso problem hypothesis of Burnside
et al. (2011). Almost invariably, the results differ greatly across good versus bad carry trades.
In Section VI, we further explore the properties of good and bad carry trades to kindle research on
economic models that may explain the strong differences between the two types of trades. We show, for
example, that the returns of bad (good) trades derive mostly from the gain that comes from investing at
the higher interest rate while borrowing at the lower interest rate, which is partially offset (reinforced)
by exchange rate changes. We also examine the relationship between good carry trades and the ”dollar
carry” trade introduced in Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan (2014), which goes long (short) all currencies
relative to the US dollar when the average foreign interest rate differential relative to the dollar is positive
(negative). Because our good carry trades always involve the dollar, they do show substantial return
correlation with dollar carry, but we demonstrate that they clearly present a distinct currency and economic
risk.
Before introducing ”good” and ”bad” carry trades in Section 3, we describe the data in Section 2
and discuss some important concepts regarding the design of carry trades. The remainder of the article
demonstrates how the good-bad trade distinction fundamentally alters our thinking about carry trades.

II

Data and carry trade design
Following previous work, we employ currency spot and forward contract quotes to construct carry

trade returns. Using one-month forward quotes on the last trading day of each month in the sample, and
spot quotes on the last day of the following month, we calculate one-month carry trade returns over the
sample period from 12/1984 till 06/2014 (354 monthly observations). The return calculations take into
account transaction costs, exploiting the availability of bid and ask quotes. The data comes from Barclays
Bank, as available on Datastream, and have been used in Burnside et al. (2011) and Lustig at al. (2011,
2014), among many others.
Our results are reported for percentage returns and equal (absolute) weights of the currencies entering
a trade. On two occasions we report instead results with logarithmic returns or weights proportional to
forward differentials, to facilitate comparability with previous studies.
Let Sti (Fti ) denote the spot (forward) exchange rate of currency i at time t, quoted as foreign currency
units per U.S. dollar. That is, the U.S. dollar is the benchmark currency and all trades are implemented
relative to the dollar. Then, with t indicating the end of a given month, the percentage excess one-month
return at t + 1 of one dollar invested at t in a long (short) forward foreign currency contract is:
i,long

i,ask
Rxt+1 = Fti,bid /St+1
−1

(1)

i,short
i,bid
Rxt+1
= 1 − Fti,ask /St+1
,

and

whereby bid and ask quotes are denoted in the superscript.2
We employ the G-10 currencies, which are the New Zealand dollar (NZD), Australian dollar (AUD),
British pound (GBP), Norwegian krone (NOK), Swedish krona (SEK), Canadian dollar (CAD), US dollar
(USD), Euro (EUR), Swiss franc (CHF) and Japanese yen (JPY), whereby prior to 1999 the German mark
(DEM) is used instead of the Euro. These currencies represent the most liquid traded currencies, and are
most often used both in the academic literature and professional practice to construct carry trades.
2 These

can also be seen as the payoffs to forward contracts in the foreign currency per ”forward” dollar.

4

As indicated above, the carry trades that we consider go long and short an equal number of currencies
relative to the USD, with equal weights. Various alternative weighting schemes are possible, mostly based
on the magnitude of the interest rate differentials (see Table 1 for concrete examples from practice and the
academic literature), but we prefer to keep the trade as simple as possible. Moreover, the total investment
each period is one dollar, that is, the sum of all long and short positions (in absolute value) equals one.
Specifically, when the trade uses all G-10 currencies, the five currencies with the lowest interest rates at
the end of each month are shorted, and the remaining five are held long. In practice, we rank the currencies
based on their forward differentials relative to the U.S. dollar, defined as FDt = Ft /St − 1 at time t and
calculated using mid-quotes. The weight of currency i held long (short) is ωti =

1
10

1
(ωti = − 10
). The

percentage excess return of this trade from t to t + 1 is:
(2)

o
10 n
carry
i,long
i,short
Rxt+1 = ∑ 1ωti >0 ωti Rxt+1 − 1ωti <0 ωti Rxt+1
i=1

where 1(.) is an indicator function.
When a subset of N currencies is used to construct a carry trade and N is even, we set ωti =

1
N

or − N1

in (2) and substitute N for 10. If N is odd, the currency with the median forward differential is dropped
from the trade, and we use N − 1 instead of N in the definition of ωti and the summation in (2).
We consider carry trades that are symmetric, in that they have an equal number of short and long
positions, with equal total weights on the long and short side. Currencies are ranked according to their
interest rates, and only the rank determines whether the position taken is short or long, while the signs
of the interest rate differentials are irrelevant for the trade design, as these change with the currency perspective (see also Clarida, Davis, and Pedersen (2009)). Importantly, our carry trade design also ensures
(approximate) numeraire independence, as we do not give a special role to the benchmark currency, and
hence the positions taken in the various participating currencies are the same, regardless of the bench-

5

mark. Numeraire independence is an attractive property, and implies that only one currency trade must
be defined for the world at large. Moreover, the returns on such a trade are very similar from any currency perspective, because the translation from one currency to another simply introduces cross-currency
risk on currency returns, which is a second-order effect. In fact, the logarithmic returns of our strategies
are exactly the same from any perspective, by triangular arbitrage (see Maurer, Tô, and Tran (2018) for
further discussion). The major commercial investable carry products delivered by the major players in
the foreign exchange market, such as Deutsche Bank or Citibank, described in Table 1, are symmetric
and numeraire-independent as per our definition. They do not all assign equal weights to all positions
however, e.g. the well-known tradeable Deutsche Bank carry strategy takes only the three highest- and
lowest-yielding currencies among the G-10 currencies.
Non-symmetric trade designs are also possible, and have been considered, for example in a recent wellrecognized article by Burnside et al. (2011), where all currencies with interest rates that are higher (lower)
than the US dollar interest rate are bought (sold) in equal proportions. Such a strategy is obviously not
symmetric, and also may deliver very different results depending on the benchmark currency (see Daniel,
Hodrick, and Lu (2017) for further discussion). Another example of a non-symmetric trade is the ”dollar
carry” trade, studied in Lustig et al. (2014). These trades are also ”dollar-neutral”, excluding positions
in the benchmark currency (which would generate zero excess returns). In contrast, our symmetric trades
are not dollar-neutral: positions in the benchmark currency are explicitly included.

III

Good and bad carry trades from the G-10 currencies

In this section we first outline a disciplined approach to create historically attractive symmetric carry
trades from subsets of the G-10 currencies, exploiting all available foreign exchange history at each point
in time. It evaluates on each trading date whether excluding currencies can improve on the standard carry

6

trade (SC) that uses all G-10 currencies, and if so, which currencies should be excluded. Because of its
dynamic implementation, the procedure yields out-of-sample results. Next, we exploit the information
garnered in his exercise to create fixed subsets of ”good” and ”bad” currencies that do not change over
time, and use them to construct carry trades over the full sample period.

A

Enhancing the currency carry trade
Imagine an investor starting to trade at the end of December 1994 (t = T1 ). On this date, and at the end

of each month going forward till May 2014 (t = T2 ), he uses all available return information for the period
since December 1984 (t = T0 ) and first calculates the Sharpe ratio (denoted ”benchmark Sharpe ratio”) of
the standard carry trade (SC) that employs all G-10 currencies. The trade ranks these currencies according
to their forward differentials at the end of each month between T0 and t − 1, for t = T1 , ..., T2 , and goes
long (short) over the following month the five currencies with the highest (lowest) forward differentials,
all with equal weights.
To create an enhanced carry trade with nine currencies, on date t the investor excludes one by one
each of the G-10 currencies, and computes the Sharpe ratios over T0 to t of the ten possible trades that
involve only nine currencies. These trades exclude the currency with the median forward differential at the
end of each month between T0 and t − 1 and go long (short) the four currencies with the highest (lowest)
differentials. If the highest of the ten Sharpe ratios obtained in this way exceeds the benchmark Sharpe
ratio, an enhanced trade is implemented over the following month (t to t + 1) using the nine currencies
corresponding to this highest Sharpe ratio, while the one currency left out of the trade is the first to be
excluded on date t. If, on the other hand, all ten Sharpe ratios are lower than the benchmark ratio, then no
currency is excluded and the enhanced trade for this date has the return of the standard trade.
Note that the dynamic and real-time nature of this enhanced trade could, in principle, result in a
substantially different currency mix used at different points of time. Further, our enhancement rule is
7

intentionally simple and uses an easily understood and popular performance measure, whereas a wide
range of sophisticated optimization rules could be applied in this context as well (see, e.g., Barroso and
Santa-Clara (2014)). Mimicking the construction of the enhanced trade that uses nine currencies, we
construct analogous enhanced trades that exclude more than one of the G-10 currencies. In particular,
on date t when one currency has been excluded, we use the remaining nine currencies to find the highest
Sharpe ratio across the nine possible trades that involve only eight currencies. Again, if this highest ratio
exceeds the benchmark Sharpe ratio, the currency that was omitted to achieve it is the second currency
to be excluded for this date, whereas if all Sharpe ratios are lower than the benchmark one, no further
currency is excluded and the enhanced trade that uses eight currencies has the return of the standard trade
for that date. Similarly, we attempt to exclude up to seven of the G-10 currencies on this date t, and thus
obtain seven enhanced trades, which use a decreasing number of currencies. Importantly, we record the
exact order in which currencies have been excluded. The above procedure is repeated on each date in the
sample to obtain time series of returns of the seven enhanced carry trades.
For completeness of the search algorithm, we have postulated that if no improvement on the benchmark Sharpe ratio can be achieved for a certain date and number of excluded currencies, then no further
currencies are excluded on this date, and all enhanced trades with fewer currencies have the return of the
standard trade. In practice, however, this choice is inconsequential (see below).

B

Return patterns for enhanced trades
Table 2 presents results for the enhanced carry trades that allow excluding from one to as much as

seven currencies on each trading date, and, for comparability, for the standard carry trade. Returns are
computed as described in Section II, with equal currency weights and in percent. Panel A of Table 2
reports the annualized average returns, annualized Sharpe ratios, and return skewness for each carry trade,
with interest in skewness justified given its important role in certain explanations for the carry trade returns
8

(e.g., Brunnermeier et al. (2009), Jurek (2014)). Also reported are p-values for the hypothesis that the
respective Sharpe ratio or skewness does not exceed that for the standard trade SC. Because carry returns
tend to be negatively skewed, we cannot rely on standard tests for the difference between Sharpe ratios,
as for example in Jobson and Korkie (1981) or Memmel (2003), that apply to Gaussian distributions.
Therefore, we resort to the bootstrap tests, described in Ledoit and Wolf (2008) for Sharpe ratios, and
Annaert, Van Osselaer, and Verstraete (2009) for skewness (see Appendix OA-II for details). Our pvalues use one-sided bootstrap confidence intervals, as the enhanced carry trades are designed with the
goal to improve on SC.
The SC trade has an annualized Sharpe ratio of 0.32, and return skewness of -0.33. The benchmark
Sharpe ratio is thus close, for example, to the value of 0.31 for the HML trade reported in Lustig et al.
(2014) for their set of developed countries, over a similar sample period and using equal weighting and
bid and ask quotes. When one currency is excluded from the carry trade on each trading day, practically
no change is observed, but when two currencies are excluded, the Sharpe ratio increases to 0.41, while
skewness drops to -0.57. When three to six currencies are excluded, the Sharpe ratios remain somewhat
higher than the benchmark ratio (between 0.41 and 0.46), with the differences not statistically significant.
However, skewness improves sharply in three out of these four cases and turns positive on two occasions
(and as high as 0.21 on one), whereby two of the associated p-values are below 5% and another one
equals 10%. These findings indicate a possible two-dimensional beneficial effect of excluding three or
more of the G-10 currencies, given that both the Sharpe ratio and skewness improve, albeit not always in
a statistically significant way. This effect is further confirmed by the enhanced trade that excludes seven
currencies: the Sharpe ratio is now 0.61, while skewness is positive, and both are marginally significantly
different from the benchmark values.
Our findings echo previous results, where significant improvements in skewness are obtained without

9

a substantial change in the Sharpe ratio (for example, the option-hedged carry trades in Burnside et al.
(2011). However, what is surprising in our case is that the improvement of the return profile is (i) in both
dimensions, and (ii) achieved simply by excluding currencies from the symmetric carry trade. Additionally, the two-dimensional improvement is achieved by a procedure that maximizes the Sharpe ratios alone,
without considering the skewness of the returns so obtained.

C

Identity of the excluded currencies
While on each trading date the enhanced trade re-considers the available return history and thus can

potentially deliver a different set of currencies to be excluded, we consistently observe the same currencies
to be excluded. Panel B of Table 2 shows the number of months that each G-10 currency is excluded by the
enhancement rule from Section A over the 234-month sample period of enhanced trading. In particular, it
shows how many times the respective currency is the first, or among the first two, or among the first three,
etc., to be excluded from the carry trade.
The consistency is observed most clearly with respect to the first three currencies excluded. Specifically, AUD is the first to be excluded on 135 out of the 234 trading dates in the sample. Furthermore, it
is among the first three currencies to be excluded on a total of 192 dates. Similarly, NOK is among the
first three excluded on 219 occasions, and JPY is among them on 214 occasions. These three currencies
appear to be by far the most detrimental to carry trade Sharpe ratios - no other currency is ever excluded
first, and only the EUR has been excluded second or third more than a handful of times.
The next currencies to be the most often excluded are the EUR, NZD, CAD and CHF, and while the
order of their exclusion is somewhat ambiguous, these are the obvious further candidates for exclusion
by the enhancement rule. The remaining three currencies are clearly found valuable by the rule: GBP
and SEK are among the first seven to be excluded only on about 60 occasions each, and in fact are never
among the first four excluded. Most conspicuously, however, the USD is never among even the first seven
10

excluded currencies, reminiscent of previous studies discussing the special role of the USD in the carry
trade (e.g., Lustig et al. (2014), Daniel et al. (2017)) from various perspectives.
These findings are surprising, as the enhancement rule consistently excludes from the carry trade precisely the prototypical carry trade currencies, like the JPY and AUD, which have been perpetually among
the lowest- or highest-yielding G-10 currencies, and feature commonly as examples in various carry trade
discussions. Because the consistency refers to the entire period since 1994, the recent financial crisis,
which witnessed drastic valuation changes in those currencies, cannot be solely responsible. Likewise, the
enhancement rule also tends to exclude the NZD and CHF, which have also been among the few highestor lowest-yielding currencies over our sample period.
The design of the enhancement procedure, as described in Section A, leaves open the possibility that
on some date no improvement of the Sharpe ratio can be achieved after certain number of exclusions,
whereby no further currencies are excluded and the respective enhanced trades are assigned the SC return
for the next trading period. This possibility is of some concern, as it could blur the distinction between
enhanced trades that exclude a different number of currencies. However, Panel B in Table 2 reveals that
this has never happened in our sample, as evidenced by the fact that the sum of the numbers in the first
row equals 234, the sum of those on the second row equals 234 × 2, and so on. Therefore, on each date in
the sample period the enhancement rule has identified seven currencies to be sequentially excluded, and
hence seven distinct enhanced trades to be implemented.
In sum, Table 2 shows that the enhancement rule consistently excludes the same few currencies from
the carry trade, among which are those epitomizing the essential concept underlying carry trades that low
(high) yield currencies should be sold (bought). The surprising evidence presented in Table 2 thus calls
for a re-consideration of this concept and/or its implementation.

11

D

Good and bad carry trades from fixed subsets of the G-10 currencies
Prompted by the finding that the dynamic enhancement rule excludes the same currencies over and

over, we now examine carry trades constructed with fixed subsets of the G-10 currencies. While staying
close to the spirit of the enhanced trades, the fixed subsets allow for better comparison with previous carry
trade results, which are similarly obtained using fixed sets of currencies over fixed sample periods. Our
choice of the fixed subsets is informed by the order of exclusion implied by Panel B of Table 2, which
shows that (i) the three currencies that are the least often excluded by the enhancement rule are the GBP,
SEK and USD, (ii) the next three least often excluded are the CAD, NZD and CHF, whereas (iii) the AUD,
NOK and JPY are the most often excluded currencies.
In particular, we construct five carry trades from fixed subsets, which (i) exclude only the AUD, NOK
and JPY, (ii) include the GBP, SEK and USD, together with any of the three possible pairs from the CAD,
NZD and CHF, and (iii) keep only the GBP, SEK and USD. These carry trades are designed to illustrate
the properties of enhanced carry trades, and we denote them by G1 to G5, a notation we shall clarify
shortly. The first column of Table 3 displays the codes of the currencies included in each of these five
trades. We also consider the trades complementary to G1-G5, which include the currencies that are left
out of each of these trades, and denote these complements by B1 to B5, respectively, with currency codes
again displayed in the first column of Table 3. For example, only the three most often excluded currencies
(AUD, NOK and JPY) enter the B1 carry trade.
In addition, we consider a larger set of trades which can represent more broadly the enhanced carry
trades: it consists of 18 trades from five currencies each, and is denoted by GC, whereby each trade
includes the three least often excluded currencies (GBP, SEK and USD), together with any possible pair
from the remaining currencies which has none or only one of the three most often excluded currencies
(AUD, NOK and JPY). This choice yields a reasonably large cross section of trades which maintains the

12

predominant presence of currencies that are preferred by the enhancement rule. Again, we also consider
the 18 complementary trades, and denote them by BC. Despite creating many carry trades from only five
currencies, the average correlation among the returns of the 18 good trades is 0.66, and thus lower, for
example, than the average correlation among the 25 value-weighted Fama-French portfolios sorted on size
and book-to-market for the same period, which is 0.80.
Table 3 presents results for the SC trade, the G1-G5 and B1-B5 trades, and the GC and BC trades
described above, using the entire sample period from 12/1984 till 6/2014. Shown are annualized average
returns, return standard deviations and Sharpe ratios, as well as skewness. For the GC and BC trades we
show averages of these quantities. Also reported are p-values for tests of differences between the Sharpe
ratios and skewness coefficients, similar to those in Table 2. In the last two lines, the first (second) number
in parentheses shows how many of the 18 corresponding individual estimates for the GC or BC trades
are significant at the 5% (10%) level. Where p-values are (not) in square brackets, the null hypothesis is
that the Sharpe ratio or skewness of a G1-G5 trade or GC trade does not exceed that of the corresponding
B1-B5 trade or BC trade (SC trade). Note that over the full sample period the benchmark Sharpe ratio and
skewness remain close to those reported in Panel A of Table 2 for the shorter period since 1994.
The G1-G5 trades exhibit invariably higher average returns than the SC trade. In addition, their average
returns and return standard deviations tend to increase as the number of currencies in a trade decreases.
The Sharpe ratios of the G1-G5 trades all exceed the benchmark Sharpe ratio (in two cases by a factor of
about two), with the difference statistically significant at the 5% significance level in three cases out of
five. Skewness increases in three cases for the G1-G5 trades, even though this increase is significant only
for G1. Overall, these five trades reproduce the features that characterize the enhanced trades in Table 2.
In contrast, the complementary trades B1-B5 fare much worse. The average returns are often two to
three times lower than those of the SC trade, whereas the standard deviations are on average twice higher,

13

leading to much lower annualized Sharpe ratios, which are between 0.04 and 0.18. In addition, the return
skewness is markedly more negative for these complementary trades, averaging -0.77 (versus -0.11 for the
G1-G5 trades). Furthermore, the p-values shown in square brackets, pertaining to tests of the differences
in Sharpe ratios and skewness between the corresponding G1-G5 and B1-B5 trades are below 0.02 for
four out of five Sharpe ratios, and show three (one) rejections at the 5% (10%) level for skewness.
The relatively high Sharpe ratios and slightly negative or positive skewness of the G1 to G5 trades earn
them the label ”good” carry trades (”G” for good). Analogously, we refer to the B1 to B5 trades with low
Sharpe ratios and strongly negative skewness as ”bad” carry trades (”B” for bad), from now on.
Turning to the larger sets of GC and BC trades, each constructed from five currencies, the GC average
returns (Sharpe ratios) are on average three (three and a half) times higher than those for the BC ones, and
the GC skewness is on average twice lower (in absolute terms), whereby the differences are statistically
significant in about half the cases. The Sharpe ratios for the GC trades are significantly higher than those
for the SC trade in one third of the cases, in line with what was observed for the comparable G2 to G4
trades.
To further illustrate the properties of the GC and BC carry trades, Figure 2 plots their Sharpe ratios
versus skewness, similar to Figure 1, with unfilled circles and black dots, respectively. The distinction
is sharp and clear in the Sharpe ratio dimension, where, with no exception, the GC trades dominate the
BC trades, thus justifying their classification as good trades. On the other hand, a few GC (BC) trades
display low (relatively high) skewness, hence the distinction is not as clear in this dimension, even though
on average the skewness of the BC trades is still twice lower, consistent with the bad trades classification.3
In sum, eliminating some typical carry trade currencies, such as the AUD, JPY and NOK, from the
3 In unreported results we find that when trades from five currencies involve the three least often excluded currencies (GBP,
SEK, USD) in each case, but are now combined with any other pair that excludes the JPY, the good and corresponding bad
trades deliver striking separation in both the Sharpe ratio and skewness dimension.

14

currency set leads to good carry trades, with Sharpe ratios and skewness mostly higher than those of the
SC trade, and the complementary bad carry trades that involve the typical carry trade currencies. Also,
with the exception of the G1 and B1 trades, the correlations between the various trades and SC are always
higher for the bad trades (on average 0.80, versus 0.67 for the good trades).

E

Statistical significance of the distinction between good and bad carry trades
Table 3 shows that the distinction between good and bad carry trades is economically and statisti-

cally important. However, the statistical evidence must be interpreted with caution. In particular, the
reported p-values rely on the block bootstrap procedure under the alternative, developed by Ledoit and
Wolf (2008) (see Appendix OA-II). While this procedure accounts for certain finite-sample properties of
the distribution of currency returns, it does not reflect two aspects of our good carry trades. First, they are
constructed using information from the enhancement procedure, as reported in Panel B of Table 2, and
thus the procedure suffers from look-back bias. Second, the enhancement procedure applied to a finite
sample is bound to lead to improved Sharpe ratios, even if in population all 10 currencies are necessary to
attain optimal results. Therefore, a modified test is needed to assess the statistical contribution as fairly as
possible. We emphasize, however, that the results in Table 3 need not be statistically significant to impact
carry research: the finding that the prototypical carry trade currencies, if anything, worsen or certainly do
not provide a positive contribution to carry returns, suffices.
With respect to the look-back bias, starting the sample in 1994, rather than 1984 weakens the statistical
significance somewhat, but we still retain significance at the 10% level for the majority of the trades (not
reported). A full correction for this bias would require a much longer sample where we actually let the
procedure choose which currencies to exclude ex-ante, before we record trading results.
Incorporating the selection procedure into a test of statistical significance is harder, because it requires
creating a benchmark world in which carry trades still have realistic attractive returns, but somehow the
15

identity of the currencies contributing to these returns is randomized. Appendix OA-III describes in detail a procedure creating entirely randomized individual currency returns which nonetheless reproduces
exactly the returns of standard carry (SC) in each randomized sample. We then apply our enhancement
strategy to 1000 such randomized samples, finding that the selection procedure biases the Sharpe ratios of
the good trades upwards by about 0.15 and that only the G5 (at the 5% level) and G3 (at the 10% level)
deliver statistically significant improvements in Sharpe ratios, using proper t-statistics.
Thus, there is no overall strong statistical evidence that the enhancement procedure delivers significantly higher Sharpe ratios. However, it remains the case that the prototypical, ”skewed” carry currencies
can be removed from the trade without worsening performance.

IV

Good carry trades as currency market risk factors

Lustig et al. (2011) suggest as a key currency market risk factor the return of a trading strategy
that each month goes long (short) a portfolio with the highest (lowest) forward differentials. This is
obviously a symmetric carry trade strategy and is denoted here as ”HMLFX ” (to be distinguished from the
Fama-French HML factor used in Section V). Creating test portfolios by ranking currencies on forward
differentials, they find that the covariation with HMLFX largely explains the difference in average returns
between these portfolios. Furthermore, they propose HMLFX as a proxy for a global risk factor in a noarbitrage model explaining the results, and show that it is also related to a measure of aggregate stock
market volatility. Menkhoff et al. (2012) conduct a similar exercise using a global exchange rate volatility
factor as a proxy for the global risk factor. We now revisit these findings by considering the good carry
trades as risk factors and comparing their performance with that of the previously used currency market
factors.

16

A

Test assets and risk factors
The test assets in our pricing tests are five portfolios of currencies of developed countries (denoted

”Developed”), and six portfolios which also include emerging market currencies (denoted ”All”), created
by sorting the respective set of currencies on forward differentials, and taken from Adrien Verdelhan’s
website for the period ending in 12/2013. We consider these 11 portfolios together in our tests, and not
the ”All” and ”Developed” separately, as Lustig et al. (2011) do. The larger cross section poses a higher
hurdle to the various risk factors that are examined and compared.4 Our versions of the 11 portfolios
account for transaction costs.
Moving to the risk factors, first we use HMLFX (”All” version) as in Lustig et al. (2011) (and available
at Verdelhan’s website). Next, we use a mimicking portfolio for the innovations in foreign exchange
volatility (denoted ”FXVol”) as in Menkhoff et al. (2012). Finally, we also consider as risk factors the good
carry trades G1-G5 to contrast their performance, particularly with HMLFX . Because the correlations
between the G1-G5 trades and HMLFX (FXVol) are on average 0.39 (-0.29), and do not exceed 0.55
in magnitude multi-collinearity concerns do not arise. The respective correlations for the B1-B5 trades
average 0.64 (-0.71), suggesting a closer relation between the previously considered currency market
factors and our bad carry trades.

B

Design of asset pricing tests
We adopt a standard asset pricing framework, following Cochrane (2005, Chapters 12 and 13), and

consider linear factor models, both in their beta representation and stochastic discount factor (SDF) form,
4 While

using some currencies twice in each test, the average correlation between the six ”All” portfolios and five ”Developed” portfolios is only 0.74, which is just slightly higher than the average correlation among the ”Developed” (0.72) or the
”All” portfolios (0.68). Moreover, we have verified that the relative performance of the risk factors separately on the ”All” and
”Developed” portfolios remains largely the same.

testing if the pricing errors are jointly equal to zero (see, e.g., Cochrane (2005, page 237)).5

Good carry trades in competition with other currency market risk factors
Table 4 shows the results of tests which compare the performance of HMLFX and the good carry trades

as risk factors. As in Lustig et al. (2011), each test also includes the dollar factor, denoted RX, which
is the average excess return of their basket of currencies held long against the USD. In each of the two
panels of the table, the first line refers to a model with the RX and HMLFX factors alone, the next five
lines to models with RX and each of the good carry trades G1-G5, and the remaining five lines to models

combining RX, HMLFX and each of the G1-G5 trades. The top panel summarizes results from time-series
regressions of each of the test assets, and reports average coefficient estimates and (in parentheses) the
number of respective estimates that are significant at the 5 or 10% confidence levels. (The regression
results for each individual test asset are shown in the Online Appendix, Table OA-6.) The bottom panel
reports both the prices of risk λ and the SDF coefficient estimates b. The latter are key in evaluating
the relative importance of alternative factors for pricing a given cross section (see, e.g., Cochrane (2005,
Chapter 13.4)).
The top panel of the table does not reveal important differences between HMLFX and the good carry
trades: the slope coefficients β in the time-series regressions are similarly significant; the R2 related to
HMLFX is slightly higher, but so are the respective intercepts α. When entering the regression jointly,
the two factors also show similar significance, with the HMLFX coefficients remaining negative on average, but the coefficients on the good trades turning all positive on average. The RX factor always has a
statistically significant slope coefficient of around 1.1. In the bottom panel of Table 4, all two-factor models (RX with either HMLFX or a good carry trade) show significant prices of risk λ for HMLFX and the
good trades (at the 5% level), but not for the RX factor. However, in the three-factor models the p-values
increase somewhat for HMLFX , and in three cases become significant only at the 10% level, while the
significance remains unaffected for the λ’s of the good trades.
An essential difference, however, is observed with respect to the SDF coefficients b. In the two-factor
models, the b-coefficient for HMLFX is significant at the 10% level only, but at the 5% level for all
good trades. However, in the three-factor models the b coefficients turn highly insignificant for HMLFX ,
whereas for the good carry trades they remain significant at the 5% level in three of the five cases, and at
the 10% level in one case. Moreover, the test for the pricing errors being jointly equal to zero rejects in
this sample for the two-factor model with RX and HMLFX with a p-value of zero, while the corresponding

19

p-values for the models with RX and a good trade are all above 0.10, except for G3 where the p-value is
0.09. The test fails to reject the three-factor models at the 5% level for all specifications. In addition, the
b coefficients appear similar across different specifications for the good trades, but not for the HMLFX
factor, where the sign switches across specifications. The results in the bottom panel of Table 4 clearly
favor the good carry trades over HMLFX as risk factors explaining the returns of the interest rate-sorted
currency portfolios.
Table OA-1 in the Online Appendix shows results from analogous tests, but with the currency volatility
factor FXVol replacing HMLFX . The conclusions remain robust: the good carry trades again win the horse
race, with p-values for all their SDF coefficients equal to 0.01 or lower, while these p-values are never
below 15% for FXVol.

D

Return predictability of good and bad carry trades
The cross-sectional tests we have conducted follow the extant literature and assume constant prices of

risk and betas. It is surely conceivable that these assumptions are violated and thus that additional factors
may affect the unconditional cross section of currency returns (see e.g. Jagannathan and Wang (1996)).
There is, in fact, evidence of carry return predictability. Bakshi and Panayotov (2013) document that
commodity index returns and exchange rate volatility strongly predict carry trade returns. Further, Ready
et al. (2017) find time-series predictive ability of an index of shipping costs, the Baltic Dry Index (BDI),
for carry trade returns. They primarily investigate an unconditional carry strategy that is always long
the currencies of commodity exporters (commodity-producing countries) and short those of commodity
importers (countries producing final goods), which is a key component of their model.
In Table 5 we reconsider the evidence for time-series predictability from the perspective of good and
bad carry trades. To follow closely the empirical design in the two studies cited above, we use log returns
of equally-weighted good and bad carry trades. The commodity index predictor is defined as the three20

avg

month log change in the CRB index. Exchange rate volatility, σt , is the cross-sectional average of
the annualized standard deviation of the daily log changes over each month t for each of the G-10 spot
exchange rates against the USD. The volatility predictor at the end of month t (and used to predict the
avg
avg 
return for month t + 1) is then the three-month log change ln σt /σt−3 . The shipping cost predictor is

the three-month log change in the BDI. As in Bakshi and Panayotov (2013), we show in-sample predictive
slope coefficients β and their p-values, using Hodrick (1992) standard errors, adjusted R2 ’s, and p-values
for the MSPE-adjusted statistic of Clark and West (2007).6 In addition, we show an (out-of-sample)
measure of the economic significance of the predictability, using the following strategy: if the predicted
carry return for month t + 1 is positive (negative), the strategy enters a carry trade at the end of month t
(no position is taken and the strategy’s return for month t + 1 is zero). The reported measure ”∆ SR” of
economic significance equals the difference between the Sharpe ratio of the trading strategy, implemented
with the respective subset of G-10 currencies, and the corresponding carry trade as shown in the first
column. The predictive regressions use an expanding window with initial length of 120 months.
Table 5 shows clear differences between the return predictability results for good and bad carry trades.
Out of 15 possible combinations with the three predictors, the G1-G5 trades show a significant predictive
slope on three occasions, whereas the B1-B5 trades record 13 occasions with p-values not higher than 0.05
and another one with a p-value below 0.10. The average predictive R2 is 0.7% for the G1-G5 trades and
2.2% for the B1-B5 trades. The MSPE statistics show significant out-of-sample predictability in one case
(out of 15) for the G1-G5 trades and in 13 cases for the B1-B5 trades. Finally, exploiting the predictability
in dynamic trading does not materially impact the Sharpe ratio for the G1-G5 trades (the average change
is -0.005), while it mostly improves the Sharpe ratio for the B1-B5 trades, on average by 0.10. The
6 MSPE

stands for ”mean squared prediction error”. The statistic is obtained using ft+1 = (yt+1 − µt+1 )2 − [(yt+1 −b
µt+1 )2 −
2
(µt+1 − b
µt+1 ) ], where b
µt+1 is the prediction for month t + 1 from a predictive regression yt+1 = a + bxt + εt+1 , and µt+1 is the
historical average of y. Both b
µt+1 and µt+1 are estimated using data up to month t. The null hypothesis is that b
µt+1 does not
improve on the forecast which uses µt+1 as the predictor. The test statistic is the t-statistic from the regression of ft+1 on a
constant, for which we report one-sided p-values.

21

improvement is economically large , because the Sharpe ratios for bad carry trades are often below 0.10
(see Table 3). The above patterns are confirmed by the results from the GC and BC trades, where again
the GC trades show insignificant predictive slopes for two of the predictors, twice smaller predictive R2 ’s,
rarely significant out-of-sample predictability, and on average a reduction in Sharpe ratios from exploiting
predictability by 0.01, in contrast to the BC trades which exhibit an increase by 0.09 in Sharpe ratios on
average.
Our predictability results echo some findings in Ready et al. (2017). The CRB commodity index most
strongly predicts the returns of the factor that they denote IMX, which is long AUD, NZD and NOK, and
short JPY and CHF, as often true for our bad trades.7 Therefore, our Table 5 confirms the predictive ability
of the CRB and BDI for a ”commodity focused” carry trade as implied by their commodity trade model.
Our contribution here, however, is to highlight the similarity between the commodity-based trade and our
bad carry trades, and the fact that a commodity-based interpretation of carry trade returns reflects mostly
features of bad carry trades.
Our results therefore qualify the prevailing carry return predictability story. A carry trade that focuses
on the prototypical carry currencies is rather unattractive, but its return properties can be enhanced by exploiting return predictability. In contrast, our good carry trades have attractive properties which, however,
cannot be enhanced by the predictors previously identified in Bakshi and Panayotov (2013). It remains, of
course, conceivable they are predictable by other variables.

V

Good and bad carry trades and previous carry interpretations
This section reconsiders previous studies of carry trades from the good-bad carry trade perspective.
7 They

also show that a complement to the IMX trade (denoted CHML) is not predictable at all by the CRB or BDI, and also
has practically zero skewness, similar to some of our good trades. However, the Sharpe ratio of CHML is still below that of their
version of the standard carry trade (0.85 vs. 0.95 in their sample and without transaction costs), hence their orthogonalization
procedure fails to identify a good carry trade.

22

A

Explaining carry trade returns with equity market risk factors
We start by re-examining a key result in the literature stating that standard (linear) equity market

factor models cannot explain the time variation in carry returns, which appear uncorrelated with these
risk factors in normal times, but correlate highly with them in crisis times (e.g., Melvin and Taylor (2009),
Christiansen, Ranaldo, and Söderlind (2011)). We examine three models: (i) the Fama-French three-factor
model, following Burnside et al. (2011), (ii) a three-factor model with the market factor, the global equity
volatility factor used in Lustig et al. (2011), and their product, and (iii) a model with two factors which
explicitly distinguish the down- and up-moves of the equity market, in the spirit of Lettau, Maggiori,
and Weber (2015). The latter two models effectively exhibit a non-linearity that may capture the timevariation in the correlation mentioned above. To conserve space, we relegate detailed results to the Online
Appendix, summarizing the key results here.
Let’s start with the model featuring a market factor (denoted MKT), proxied by the total return of
the MSCI-World equity index, in excess of the risk-free rate and expressed in USD, an equity volatility
factor (EqVol) constructed as in Lustig et al. (2011), and the interaction term (the product of MKT and
EqVol). Table OA-2 shows that in time-series regressions of carry trade returns on the three risk factors
the main difference between good and bad trades is in their loadings on the product factor. These are
typically negative, albeit rarely significant, for the good trades, while they are positive, much larger in
magnitude, and almost always significant at the 5% significance level for the bad trades. Given that
increases in volatility tend to coincide with market downturns, the market exposure of the bad trades
increases substantially in bad times, making them under-perform in times of crisis.
We also perform GMM-based cross-sectional tests on the GC and BC return cross sections. For the
GC trades, the risk price for the MKT factor is significant at the 5% level, while for the BC trades no risk
price is significant, although the model is not rejected for either of the two cross sections. When we run a

23

simple OLS regression of actual average returns on a constant and the model-based expected returns, we
obtain an R2 of 0.67 for the GC trades, and 0.29 for the BC trades. The combined evidence suggests that
this three-factor model does not adequately describe the returns of the bad carry trades, but still saliently
reveals the high exposure of these trades to the equity market during high-volatility periods. In contrast, a
significant price of risk for the market factor and tighter link between model expected returns and average
returns show the promise of the model to provide a risk-based interpretation of good carry trades.
The Online Appendix further shows quite similar results for the model with an Up- and Down-market
factors. Table OA-3 shows that good (bad) carry trades load primarily on the Up (Down)-market factor,
with beta exposures being economically and statistically very different across the two types of trades.
In the cross-sectional tests, the prices of risk for both factors are significant; the pricing errors are not
statistically different from zero and the model generates expected returns highly (weakly) correlated with
good (bad) carry trades.
The Online Appendix and Table OA-4 report analogous results for the Fama-French three-factor
model. Here the time-series regressions reveal that good carry trades do not load much on any of the
three factors, and retain significant alphas relative to the model. In contrast, the bad carry trades feature
significantly higher regression slope coefficients on all three factors and it is striking that their SMB and
HML exposures are positive and economically meaningful (often even above 0.10). However, the FamaFrench model fails to fit expected returns cross-sectionally, with all prices of risk being insignificantly
different from zero for both good and bad carry trades.
In sum, the evidence from Tables OA-2 to OA-4 provides (weak) support for the ability of risk factors from the equity market to explain the returns of the good carry trades. Our results are not directly
comparable to studies analysing numeraire-dependent carry trades, such as Daniel et al. (2017).

24

B

Currency crashes as an explanation for the carry return puzzle
One established explanation for the carry trade’s profitability is that it reflects compensation for the

negative return skewness or crash risk, inherent to these trades. For example, Brunnermeier et al. (2009)
argue that ”investment currencies are subject to crash risk, that is, positive interest rate differentials are
associated with negative conditional skewness of exchange rate movements.... The skewness cannot easily
be diversified away, suggesting that currency crashes are correlated across different countries .... This
correlation could be driven by exposure to common, crash-risk factors”. If agents exhibit a preference for
positive skewness, an equilibrium model may generate negatively skewed returns and high Sharpe ratios
for the carry trade.
However, the crash risk hypothesis is not consistent with our findings from good and bad carry trades
(see Figure 1 and Table 3): good carry trades have relatively high Sharpe ratios and slightly negative
(or even positive) skewness. The assertion in Brunnermeier et al. (2009) that the negative skewness in
carry trade returns cannot be diversified away must also be qualified. We have demonstrated that, in fact,
skewness can be dramatically improved by judiciously removing currencies from the carry trade, without
impairing profitability. Studies relying on option market data (e.g., Burnside et al. (2011), Jurek (2014))
have criticized the crash-risk hypothesis before, because options can essentially hedge away the crash risk
without undermining much the carry trade’s profitability.

VI

Further exploration of good and bad carry trades

In this section we embark on a more detailed examination of the good and bad carry trades, trying to
set the stage for future work that will hopefully clarify fully the economic interpretation of our findings.
First, we reflect on the return components of various carry trades and how they contribute to the differential
performance of the good and bad trades. Second, the good carry trades always include the USD (it is never

25

excluded in our selection procedure). There is a burgeoning literature stressing the special nature of the
USD in international financial markets: Adrian, Etula, and Shin (2015) associate increased global dollar
funding with expected currency depreciations; Hassan (2013) argues that economies representing a larger
share of world wealth have low interest rates and low risk premiums, whereas Maggiori (2013) ascribes
a low premium to holding the USD to its role as a reserve currency. Lustig et al. (2014) explore a new
trade, denoted ”dollar carry”, which goes long (short) in all foreign currencies against the USD with equal
weights when their average interest rate differential relative to the USD is positive (negative). The dollar
carry trade has a very attractive Sharpe ratio, substantially higher than that of SC, raising the issue that
we may have simply repackaged dollar carry into our good carry trades. We show that this is not the case,
and these two types of trades, while correlated, are economically distinct.

A

The sources of good and bad carry returns
In Table 6, we decompose carry trade returns into an interest rate (or forward differential) component,

and an exchange rate change component. SC derives more than 100% of its returns from the interest rate
component, i.e., the investment currencies do depreciate and/or the funding currencies do appreciate, but
the exchange rate component is sufficiently small relative to the ”carry” to leave an attractive return on the
table. Bad carry trades have higher carry return components, both in absolute terms (and the difference is
statistically significant) and in relative terms, but even more negative exchange rate components, so that
lower returns than those for standard carry are obtained. In contrast, good carry trades derive their returns
both from the carry and exchange rate components. Their carry component is on average about 20 basis
points lower than that of SC in three cases (and statistically significant at the 5% level for the G4 trade),
while it is significantly higher for the G3 trade (even if still lower than the carry of any bad trade).
The contrast between the carry contributions to the returns of bad and good trades is illustrated in
Figure 3. The graph plots total average return on the horizontal axis, and the ratio of carry to total return
26

on the vertical axis for all trades considered in this paper (18 GC trades, 18 BC trades, as well as the G1
and G5, and B1 and B5 trades). The graph also includes the standard and dollar carry trades. Bad carry
trades have lower returns and much higher carry-to-return ratios; good carry trades have higher returns,
and derive between 50 and 100% of their returns from carry (the G5 trade being the only exception).
These results suggest that the unbiasedness hypothesis may not be strongly rejected for bad carry
currencies, which include the prototypical carry currencies. Recall that a necessary condition for a carry
trade to deliver excess returns is that the unbiasedness hypothesis does not hold, at least for some period
of time (see Bekaert, Wei, and Xing (2007) for recent tests of the hypothesis). However, when examining
standard regressions testing the unbiasedness hypothesis for the four pairs containing prototypical carry
currencies, AUD/JPY, NZD/JPY, AUD/CHF and NZD/CHF (see Table 7), we find no strong rejections
of the hypothesis. In particular, we regress future exchange rate changes onto a constant and the current
forward differential, and the null hypothesis is that the constant is zero and the slope coefficient is one.
The constants (slope coefficients) in all four regressions are insignificantly different from zero (one).
Most saliently, the slope coefficient for the AUD/JPY regression is 0.92, and thus remarkably close to one.
However, our analysis reveals the NOK also to be a ”bad” currency, more so than the CHF and the NZD.
Interestingly, Table 7 shows that the slope coefficient in unbiasedness regressions of the NOK relative
to the CHF and JPY is either not significantly different from one, or exceeds one by a large amount,
indicating an expected depreciation of the NOK relative to the JPY when the NOK interest rate exceeds
the JPY one. This is partially counteracted by a positive and significant constant.
The decomposition and the regression results above also suggest that the good carry trades are likely to
be more ”active” than the bad or standard carry trades, i.e., they likely involve more frequent re-balancing.
The insightful paper by Hassan and Mano (2015) decomposes the carry trade into a ”static” trade (which
goes long (short) currencies with unconditionally low (high) forward differentials) and a dynamic trade,

27

which also helps explain deviations from unbiasedness. Such deviations, driven by the slope coefficient
in the unbiasedness regressions being different from one, lead to dynamic trades when forward premiums
are high or low relative to their unconditional means. However, carry trades can also be profitable simply
through non-zero constants in the unbiasedness regressions (see Bekaert and Hodrick (2012, Chapter 7)).
Table 8 provides some evidence on the dynamic nature of the various carry trades. We create a dummy
variable that records the proportion of currencies that change position (from long to short or vice versa) at
each point of time. For example, for a completely static trade this proportion is zero, whereas a trade where
half the currencies switch positions at each point of time would record 50% on this measure. Furthermore,
since the dynamic nature may be related to the number of currencies in the trade, it is important to take
sampling error into account. The table shows the sample averages of these proportions, together with 95%
confidence intervals, computed using the bootstrapped carry trade returns employed in Section E.
Clearly, the good carry trades are more ”dynamic” than the bad trades and the SC trade. Note that the
average proportions for good trades are invariably above the confidence interval for SC (and vice versa for
the bad trades). Yet, the proportions for the good carries and SC are relatively highly correlated in the time
series (ranging between 49% and 82%), suggesting that these trades switch currency positions at roughly
similar times. For bad carry trades the proportion of switches is typically within the confidence interval of
SC, except for the B3 trade.
The last three columns in Table 8 report the ratios between the average returns of various static carry
trades (which are never re-balanced), and the returns of the corresponding good or bad carry trade, mimicking the Hassan and Mano (2015) methodology.8 The trades are constructed with all G-10 currencies,
as well as with the currencies entering the G1-G5 and B1-B5 trades. The various ”static trades” use as
weights the average forward differentials over the 12/1984-12/1994 period (the first 120 months of our
8 We

use log returns and currency weights equal to the demeaned and normalized forward differentials at each trading date
over 1/1995-6/2014.

28

sample), demeaned and normalized to have absolute values that sum to one. The weights are kept fixed
for the entire sample period 1/1995-6/2014, without ever re-balancing.
Hassan and Mano (2015) find that static trade returns account for about 70% of carry trade returns
(but the standard error on that estimate is substantial), whereas according to Lustig et al. (2011) this
proportion is between one third and one half. Analogously, the average return of the static SC trade in
Table 8 is about half of that of the original SC trade. Importantly, there is a clear distinction between the
relative performance of the static versions of the good and bad carry trades, with the ratios between the
corresponding average returns never exceeding 0.30 (and sometimes going negative) for the good trades,
but ranging between 0.60 and 1.2 for the bad trades. The distinction is even clearer in terms of Sharpe
ratios (see the last two columns), which for the good static trades rarely exceed 0.15, much worse than
their re-balanced counterparts. In contrast, the Sharpe ratios of the re-balanced and static ”bad” trades are
close to one another.
Hence, good carry represents a dimension of standard carry that is not well explained by its static
component. This is intuitive, because good carry trades tend to exclude currencies with either the highest
or lowest forward differentials, and thus do not have stable short and long positions. In contrast, and as
shown above, the currencies involved in bad carry trades typically switch less often from long to short
positions and vice versa. Our results thus confirm the Hassan and Mano (2015) decomposition for ”bad
carry trades”, but not for ”good carry trades”. Hassan and Mano (2015) split up carry trades in the
static carry trade we studied above and a ”dynamic” trade, which essentially exploits time-variation in
the relative ranking of currencies in terms of their forward differentials, relative to their unconditional
counterparts. This dynamic trade must necessarily be relatively more important for good trades, which
feature currencies with less extreme interest rate differentials relative to the dollar, and for which the
unbiasedness hypothesis does not hold. The dynamic trade therefore also contributes positively to the

29

trade exploiting deviations from unbiasedness (what they called the ”forward premium trade”). Do note
that our results are not entirely comparable to Hassan and Mano (2015) because they do not impose
symmetry on their carry trade, while we do.

B

Good carry versus dollar carry
In this section, we characterize the differences and similarities between the dollar carry trade and our

good carry trades. First, note that dollar carry (hereafter DC for short) does not satisfy the standard conditions for a carry trade as discussed in Section II. Carry trades go long (short) high (low) yield currencies,
whereas DC combines high and low yield currencies on one side of the trade. Going back to Table 6, the
last column reports the carry (i.e., interest rate) and exchange rate change components for DC, and the last
row of the table reports p-values for a test of equality between the carry components of the trade in the respective column and DC. The DC trade derives most of its substantial returns from currency appreciation,
and only 22% from interest rate differentials. This proportion is significantly lower than that of any other
carry trade. Perhaps not surprisingly, the G5 trade, only featuring three currencies which include the USD
comes closest to DC. In Figure 3, the DC trade also represents somewhat of an outlier. Furthermore, when
constructing versions of DC from ”good” and ”bad” currencies separately, we find that their Sharpe ratios
are very similar.
Second, DC is much less dynamic than the good trades: the last row of Table 8 shows that it switches
positions more rarely (despite any switch involving all currencies). The switching proportions are also not
very correlated with those for the good trades (at most 39%) or the SC trade (47%). Furthermore, Table 8
(column ”days w/o switch”) shows that while the typical proportion of days when no currency switches
position from long to short or vice versa ranges between 0.60 and 0.80 in carry trades, it is 0.93 for DC.
Third, because good carry trades eliminate some non-dollar exposure, they should be more correlated
with DC than SC or the bad carries are. Table 9 confirms this intuition, showing in Panel A that DC has
30

the highest correlation with good trades. However, for the G1, G2 and G3 trades the correlation is less
than 50%, and it does not exceed 70% for the G5 trade. Moreover, the correlations between the good
trades (except G5) and SC are higher than those for DC. Good carries thus preserve their close link with
the SC trade, and remain distinct from DC.
In Panel B of Table 9 we report on regressions which have the returns of SC, DC or good carries either
as dependent or independent variables. Both SC and good carries have explanatory power for the DC
trade, but SC is insignificant in two specifications. The R2 ’s are relatively low, being less than 40% in
all but one case. The DC trade mostly delivers significant alphas relative to these two factors, which is
not surprising, given its very attractive return profile. Next, both SC and DC have explanatory power for
good carry trades, with almost all slope coefficients featuring p-values below 1% and R2 ’s ranging from
43 to 75%. The coefficients on SC, however, are typically much larger than the coefficients on DC. The
G2, G3 and G5 trades still show significant alphas with respect to these two factors. Finally, the return of
SC is explained with R2 s between 18 and 75% and all intercepts are insignificantly different from zero.
The explanatory power in this case comes predominantly from the good carries, as evidenced by the small
coefficients and some high p-values on DC.
Table 9 shows that neither good carries, nor DC can be perfectly spanned by other trades, despite
being correlated with them. In contrast, SC is spanned, and this is mostly due to the good carry trades.
Being proper carry trades, the good carries should therefore be viewed, unlike DC, as better versions
of SC.9 We also investigate the explanatory power of three economic factors for various carry trades,
including DC, namely, the global equity market volatility, global industrial production growth, proxied by
the OECD total growth10 , and the residual from regressing the US industrial production growth onto the
9 For further validation of this claim,

in unreported results we consider creating a mean-variance efficient portfolio from DC,
SC and one of the G1-G5 portfolios. When we do so, the good carries invariably get a large positive weight, always exceeding
that of DC, sometimes by factor of two or three, and SC is always shorted (except if paired with the G5 trade, when its weight
is close to zero). In other words, good carries dominate DC and SC is pushed out.
10 From stats.oecd.org, Monthly economic indicators, Production of total industry excluding construction, growth rate over

31

global growth variable (see Online Appendix Table OA-5 for the results). We find that, the various carry
trades are similarly related to the macro factors considered, but that DC appears to have no significant link
to these factors. Hence, an economic interpretation of the carry trade returns remains elusive.
Finally, DC and good carry trades both exhibit little skewness, but use very different mechanisms to
eliminate the impact of bad carry currencies in this respect. While the good trades simply remove the
currencies, DC puts such naturally ”long” and ”short” currencies on the same side of the trade. To see
this more clearly, consider the small table underneath, which shows average forward differentials against
the USD for the remaining G-10 currencies over our full sample period 12/1984 to 6/2014 (together with
the first three moments of the percentage returns of long positions in each currency against the USD, not
adjusted for transaction costs). All numbers are annualized and in percent, except for skewness. The bad

carry currencies (JPY, AUD and NOK) do not only have among the highest forward differentials, they also
are the most skewed. The good carry trades essentially remove these currencies and thereby do not worsen
and mostly improve the return-risk properties of the trade. Therefore, this skewness must be idiosyncratic
and not priced, or it must be endogenously generated by carry traders. Why this is the case remains an
important open question for further research, but it surely undermines any explanation of attractive carry
returns based on priced ”crash” risk.

C

Revisiting the factor pricing of currency returns
We now compare the performance of DC and good carries as pricing factors for the interest rate-sorted

portfolios, discussed in Section C above. Table 10 reports results from pricing tests, which juxtapose DC
the previous month, seasonally adjusted

32

with the G1-G5 trades, but do not include the RX factor (which only shorts the USD and has correlation
of 0.53 with DC).11 The top panel summarizes, as in previous tables, results from time-series regressions
on individual portfolios, while the bottom panel presents results from cross-sectional tests. (The first-pass
regression results for each individual test asset are shown in the Online Appendix, Table OA-7.)
DC alone explains reasonably well the time-series behavior of the test assets - none of the intercepts
and all slope coefficients are significant, even at the 5% confidence level, with a relatively high R2 of 21%.
The performance of the good trades alone is similar with respect to the intercepts, while the slopes are
not always significant and the R2 ’s are much lower in three out of five cases. Moving to the cross-section,
however, we observe that the price of risk for DC is significant only with a p-value of 0.07, while three of
the good trades show significance at the 5% level. In addition, the test for the pricing errors being jointly
equal to zero rejects with a p-value of 0.03 for DC, but never rejects for individual good carries, even at
the 10% confidence level.
We also perform cross-sectional tests which include both DC and a good trade, as reported at the
bottom of Table 10. The price of risk λ is now statistically significant for DC at the 5% level in only two out
of five cases, whereas four out of the five p-values for the good carries are at 2% or below. The p-values for
the SDF coefficients b, which provide the proper horse race test, are all above 0.20 for DC. In contrast, four
of these p-values for the good trades are below or equal to 0.10. The relatively high correlation between
DC and the G5 trade may be the source of insignificant coefficients in this specification. Also note that
the b-coefficients for the good trades are quite stable (see also Table 4), whereas the b-coefficients for DC
switch sign across specifications. While the statistical significance in favor of good trades is borderline,
the conjecture that good trades may be simply reflecting features of DC is thus not supported here.
11 DC is short the dollar about 70% of the time in our sample, and its profitability is entirely driven by these short dollar
positions. Note that this is not true for the good carry trades, which gain both when the dollar is short and long.

Conclusion

This paper introduces ”good” and ”bad” carry trades, which are all constructed from subsets of the
G-10 currencies, but exhibit markedly different return properties, in terms of Sharpe ratios and skewness.
Surprisingly, trades that just exclude some of the typical carry trade currencies do perform better than
the benchmark SC trade, while trades that only include the typical carry currencies have inferior return
profiles. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom on the construction of carry trades from an
investor’s view point. Furthermore, the trades from subsets also challenge some of the available conceptual
interpretations of the carry trade. We document that several of these interpretations appear to be mostly
consistent with the bad carry trades, but are less applicable to good trades.
We find that good carry trades can serve as risk factors, able to explain a cross section of currency
portfolio returns, and in this role can drive out previously suggested risk factors, such as the HMLFX
factor of Lustig et al. (2011). Further, the returns of good carry trades can be explained to a certain extent
with risk factors from the global equity market. While good carry trades are more strongly correlated
with the ”dollar carry” trade of Lustig et al. (2014) than is the standard carry trade, good trades remain
symmetric carry trades, deriving the bulk of their returns from carry (i.e., interest rate differentials), and
offer a distinct return profile.
The results in this paper, even though largely focused on the statistical properties of carry trade returns,
should impact the study of carry trades in various directions. First, exploring crash risk or differentiating
fundamental risks of commodity producers versus exporters are unlikely fruitful avenues of research.
Second, our reported asset pricing tests can inform further risk-based interpretations of carry trade returns.
Finally, it can be promising to explore, in the spirit of Koijen, Moskowitz, Pedersen, and Vrugt (2015),
the notion of good and bad carry trades from financial assets other than currencies.

Using mid-quotes for spot (St ) and one-month forward (Ft ) exchange rates of the G-10 currencies against the USD (Euro spliced with DEM before 1999)
from Datastream, we calculate forward differentials as Ft /St − 1. With these we construct carry trades either using all G-10 currencies, or excluding
one up to seven of these currencies, as explained in Section A. Panel A reports their averages (denoted ”avg. ret.”, annualized an in percent) and SR’s
(both annualized), as well as skewness (denoted ”skew”). The first column of the table shows how many currencies have been excluded. The columns
denoted ”p-val” are obtained using bootstrap confidence intervals for the hypothesis that the respective SR or skewness does not exceed the benchmark
one (see Appendix OA-II). The sample period is 12/1984 to 6/2014 (354 months), and the initial window for calculating SR’s that are used to decide
which currencies should be excluded is 120 months. Each column in Panel B shows how many months, out of the 234 months in which we search for
the highest SR’s, was a currency with code displayed in the first row, the first to be excluded (row starting with ”1”), or among the first two excluded
(row starting with ”2”), etc.

This table shows averages (denoted ”avg. ret.”, in percent), standard deviations (”st.dev.”, in percent) and Sharpe ratios (”SR”), all annualized, as well
as skewness (denoted ”skew”) for the monthly excess returns of several carry trades, all with equal weights. ”SC” denotes the standard carry trade
constructed with all G-10 currencies. The G1 to G5 trades are constructed using the currencies with the displayed codes, and represent combinations of
currencies that are less often excluded by the enhancement rule discussed in Section A and Table 2. B1 to B5 are the complementary trades, each using
the currencies that have been left out of one of the G1-G5 trades. ”GC” denotes the set of 18 carry trades, each constructed from the three least often
excluded currencies (USD, GBP and SEK), combined with any possible pair of the remaining G-10 currencies that contains none or only one of the
three most often excluded currencies (AUD, NOK and JPY). ”BC” denotes the set of 18 complementary carry trades, each using the five currencies left
out of one of the 18 trades in GC. The rows corresponding to the GC and BC trades show averages of the average returns, standard deviations, Sharpe
ratios and skewness across the respective 18 carry trades. The columns denoted ”p-val” show p-values obtained using bootstrap confidence intervals
(see Appendix OA-II). The first (second) number in parentheses shows how many of the 18 corresponding individual estimates are significant at the
5% (10%) confidence level. Where p-values are not in square brackets, the null hypothesis is that the respective SR or skewness does not exceed the
one of the SC trade. Where p-values are in square brackets, the null is that the SR or skewness of a G1-G5 trade or GC trade does not exceed that of the
corresponding B1-B5 trade or BC trade. The sample period is 12/1984 to 6/2014 (354 months).

Several factor pricing models are estimated with GMM, as described in Section IV, over 12/1984 to 12/2013. The 11 test assets (six ”All” and five
”Developed” interest-rate sorted currency portfolios (net returns)) and the RX (dollar) and currency HML (denoted ”HMLFX ”) factors (”All” version,
net) are as in Lustig et al. (2011), and kindly made available at Adrian Verdelhan’s website. The good carry trades G1-G5 are as in Table 3. All models
include the RX factor, and either the HMLFX or a good carry trade (as indicated in the first column), or both. The top panel reports averages of the
11 annualized average returns, time-series regression coefficients and adjusted R2 ’s (in percent). Standard errors are estimated with GMM and account
for one Newey-West lag. The first (second) number in parentheses shows how many of the 11 corresponding estimates are significant at the 5% (10%)
confidence level. The bottom panel shows, for the same models, factor risk prices λ and SDF coefficients b with p-values, as well as p-values for the
χ2 statistic testing that the pricing errors are jointly equal to zero. Average returns, α’s and λ’s are reported annualized and in percent. βGood , λGood and
bGood refer to the good carries G1-G5, as shown in the first column.

∆ SR

This table shows results from univariate predictive regressions for the log returns of the SC trade, the G1-G5 and B1-B5 trades, and the GC and BC
trades as described in Table 3. The three predictors shown in the first row of the table have been found to predict carry trade returns in Bakshi and
Panayotov (2013, Table 2) and Ready, Roussanov, and Ward (2017, Table 10), and are designed as in those studies (see also Section D). The table
displays the in-sample estimates of the predictive slope coefficients β, two-sided p-values, based on the Hodrick (1992) 1B covariance matrix estimator,
and adjusted R2 ’s (in percent). Next are shown one-sided p-values (denoted ”MS”) for the MSPE-adjusted statistic (Clark and West (2007), see also
footnote 6), obtained with an expanding window with initial length of 120 months. The columns denoted ”∆ SR” report a measure of the economic
significance of predictability, based on a prediction-based trading strategy, which enters into a carry trade at the end of month t only if the trade’s return
predicted for month t + 1 is positive (if a negative return is predicted, the carry trade return for month t + 1 is zero). Specifically, the measure equals the
difference between the Sharpe ratio of the prediction-based strategy, implemented with the respective subset of G-10 currencies, and the corresponding
unconditional carry trade (using an expanding window with initial length of 120 months). For the GC and BC trades the table shows averages of the
respective 18 predictive slope coefficients β, adjusted R2 ’s, and changes in Sharpe ratios. The first (second) number in parentheses shows how many of
the 18 corresponding individual estimates are significant at the 5% (10%) confidence level. The sample period is 12/1984 to 6/2014.

For each of the six currency pairs NZD/CHF, AUD/CHF, NOK/CHF, NZD/JPY, AUD/JPY and NOK/JPY monthly log changes in spot rates
are regressed against the corresponding forward differentials (all mid-quotes): ln(St+1 /St ) = α + β ln(Ft /St ) + εt+1 . Estimates of α and β
are shown, together with two-sided p-values, based on the Hodrick (1992) 1B covariance matrix estimator, for the null hypotheses α = 0
and β = 1. The sample period is 12/1984 - 6/2014, and the data source is Barclays Bank, via Datastream.

Carry components in carry trade returns
This table shows the average returns, and the components of these returns due to carry and exchange rate changes, for the standard (SC)
trade, the good and bad carry trades G1 to G5 and B1 to B5, and the dollar carry trade (DC) of Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan (2014),
which we consider in more detail in Section B. The respective values are shown annualized and in percent. Also shown are in curly brackets
p-values from a test for equality of the respective average carry component to that of the SC and DC trades (Newey-West standard errors,
with 12 lags).

Table 8
Dynamic nature of carry trades
The table characterizes the dynamic behavior of the the standard carry trade (SC), the G1 to G5 and B1
to B5 trades, and, in the last row, the dollar carry trade (DC) of Lustig et al. (2014), which we consider
in more detail in Section B. The first column of the table shows, for each trade, the time-series average
of the proportion of currencies that change (switch) position, from long to short or vice versa, at each
point of time. The average proportion is given in percent. The next two columns show bootstrapped 95%
confidence intervals for these average proportions. The column denoted ”days w/o switch” shows the
proportion of dates in the sample when not a single currency changed position from short to long or vice
versa. Next the table shows the correlation between the proportions for the G1 to G5 and B1 to B5 trades,
and those for standard carry (SC). The last three columns aim to compare static and dynamic versions
of our various trades. Static trades have been defined in Hassan and Mano (2015), and, to keep close to
their setup, we use as weights the average forward differentials of the respective currencies over 12/198412/1994, demeaned and normalized to have absolute values that sum to one. These weights are kept fixed
for the rest of the sample period for the static trades, without ever re-balancing. Dynamic trades are the
usual (dynamically re-balanced) trades, as considered throughout this paper, but with weights again equal
to the cross-sectionally demeaned forward differentials, normalized to have absolute values that sum to
one. Shown are the ratios between the average returns of the respective static and dynamic carry trade, and
the corresponding Sharpe ratios. Average returns and Sharpe ratios are calculated for the period 12/1994
to 6/2014.

Table 10
Dollar carry vs. good carry trades as currency market pricing factors
This table differs from Table 4 only in one aspect: instead of the RX and HMLFX factors, we now use the dollar carry factor (denoted
”DC”), as in Lustig et al. (2014) and Hassan and Mano (2015), calculated for the G-10 currencies. The test assets are again the 11 interest
rate-sorted portfolios as in Lustig et al. (2011). ”Good” refers to the good carries G1-G5.

Large black dots plot skewness versus Sharpe ratio of all possible 21 carry trades constructed from five G10 currencies, which include the AUD, CHF and JPY, together with any possible pair from the remaining
seven currencies. Circles with no fill plot similarly skewness versus Sharpe ratio for the complementary
trades, each including the five currencies left out of one of the previous 21 trades. For each trade, currencies are sorted on their forward differentials (against the USD) at the end of each month over the period
12/1984 to 6/2014, and the two currencies with highest differentials are held long over the next month,
while the two with the lowest premiums are shorted, all with equal weights. A vertical and horizontal

with all G-10 currencies. Percentage carry trade returns are calculated with spot and forward quotes from

OA-I

Symmetry and numeraire neutrality of currency trades

This Appendix explains in detail the distinction between several designs of carry trades. Start with
a set of N currencies, e.g. the G-10 currencies in our case. A currency trading strategy is a mapping
between signals at time t and currency positions taken at this time, whereby positions are defined in terms
of the weights of individual currencies. A trading strategy is formulated relative to a benchmark currency,
i.e. positions are taken relative to a certain currency in the forward market. From this perspective, two
properties seem important:
1. Symmetry: the number of short and long positions and their total weights are equal. A stronger
version of symmetry would also require equal weights of the individual short or long positions.1
2. Numeraire independence: the positions taken in the various currencies are the same, regardless of
which benchmark currency is considered. As a result, only one currency strategy must be defined
for the world at large.
Symmetry and numeraire independence are well-established features of carry trades, and have been both
adopted by recent academic studies, and implemented in investable products (see Table 1). Together, these
properties imply that the trade’s returns will be very similar from any currency perspective. This invariance
follows from the fact that the translation of returns from one currency to another simply introduces crosscurrency risk on currency returns, which is a second order effect. Conversely, if the ranking of a currency
or the signal depends in any way on the identity of the benchmark currency, then defining the same strategy
from another currency perspective will yield different currency positions and different currency weights,
and this can result in quite different returns. A well-known example is the asymmetric carry strategy in
Burnside, Eichenbaum, Kleshchelski, and Rebelo (2011), which has been shown in Daniel, Hodrick, and
1 However,

if weights are defined relative to a benchmark currency (e.g., based on forward differentials), they may differ on
the long and short end, creating weight asymmetry. This would cause the trade to be numeraire-dependent.

Lu (2017) to produce very different (and worse) returns from other, non-USD currency perspectives. In
fact, the USD-based version of this strategy is successful (at least partly) due to is its implicit exposure to
a dollar-centric currency strategy, the ”dollar carry” trade of Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan (2014).2
We now formally show that symmetric, numeraire-independent strategies have largely equivalent returns across the world. Suppose first that the USD is the benchmark currency and define the weight of
currency i as wi . Spot and forward exchange rates are quoted here as USD per one unit of a foreign currency (reversing the notation from Section II above), and denoted as Sti and Fti . The return of a US-based
currency trading strategy over the interval t to t + 1 is:
N
USD
i
rt+1
= ∑ wi [St+1
/Fti − 1].

(OA-1)

i=1

If the strategy is numeraire independent, the weights wi are identical for all currency perspectives. For
example, if the trading strategy is based on interest rate signals, these signals should be independent of the
benchmark currency.
i

Defining such a strategy relative, say, to the Japanese yen, with yen exchange rates denoted by St and

2 The

dollar carry weights are 1/(N-1) and are all either positive or negative depending on the average interest rate of the
USD relative to other currencies. The weight on the USD itself is zero. The strategy is thus very asymmetric and yields entirely
different results for other currency perspectives. That is, a ”British pound carry” or ”Swiss franc carry” need not be anything
like dollar carry. Of course, dollar-centric strategies are of interest because of the importance of the dollar in international
finance.

2

Cross-currency risk could drive, in principle, a wedge between the two currency perspectives, but in
practice the returns and their properties will be rather similar (barring significant differences in transaction
costs), because the forward to spot ratio in (OA-3) is close to one, and applies to returns. We have verified
that standard carry strategies (as per our definition in Section II) yield very similar returns from any
currency perspective.
It is instructive to repeat the previous calculation, but for log returns. In this case:

and therefore the log returns of symmetric, numeraire-independent trades are identical from any perspective; the differences between their percentage returns from different perspectives are of second order.
In sum, a symmetric carry trade, for any benchmark currency has similar returns for investors across
the world. However, symmetry is not a sufficient condition for numeraire independence. It is important to
emphasize this point, because a number of recent articles have considered ”currency-neutral” symmetric
strategies, where no position is taken with respect the benchmark currency itself, or in other words, the
weight assigned to the benchmark currency is always zero (this is implicitly true also for dollar carry).
Let’s examine, following Daniel, Hodrick, and Lu (2017), a ”dollar-neutral” carry trade with weights
wi = 1/(N − 1) if the interest rate of currency i is in top half of the interest rates of the given set of
currencies, and wi = −1/(N − 1) otherwise (if N-1 is odd, the currency with the median interest rate is left
out of the trade). This strategy is clearly symmetric. However, it is not numeraire independent because if

3

we define it relative to another benchmark currency, say the yen, the weight function of this ”yen-neutral”
trade will change, with now non-zero weights on the USD and zero weights on the JPY. Therefore, such
”currency-neutral” trades will produce different returns for different benchmark currencies, going beyond
the differences induced by cross-currency risk.
We recognize that some numeraire-dependent strategies are of obvious interest, but care must be taken
to define them in an international context. For example, the HML factor, introduced by Lustig, Roussanov,
and Verdelhan (2011, 2014) is a carry trade which is symmetric, but not numeraire-independent as it goes
long (short) an extreme portfolio based on an interest rate ranking (as the DB strategy does), but excludes
the USD from any portfolio. This dollar neutrality makes the trade numeraire-dependent. Of course,
when such a trade is defined for benchmark currencies with non-extreme interest rates, it should often
yield similar returns across the different country perspectives.
Our preference for using symmetric, numeraire-independent carry trades is consistent with the best
known investable indices, such as the Deutsche Bank (DB) Harvest Indexes. The DB strategy goes long
(short) the G-10 currencies with the three highest (lowest) interest rates. Importantly, when the USD
interest rate is among the top or bottom three, part of the trade automatically gets a zero return, because a
position in the benchmark currency itself is taken, and hence the trade is not dollar-neutral. However, it is
symmetric and numeraire-independent, which is an advantage for a global currency trading strategy, and
may also be an advantage for a global risk pricing factor. In the trades that we consider, all participating
currencies are given a non-zero weight, including the benchmark currency, which by design yields a zero
return, whether it is held long or short.
Another way to see the fundamental difference between asymmetric, numeraire-dependent trades on
the one hand, and numeraire-independent strategies on the other is to examine what would happen if, say, a
yen-based investor would try to mimic, for example, dollar carry by taking exactly the same positions, but

4

relative to the yen. That is, she will go long or short in all the currencies (including the yen) as dollar carry
does, thus keeping the same weight function as in the original dollar trade, but for a different benchmark
currency. This strategy would yield quite different returns as it would face full cross-currency risk, and
not just profit and loss currency risk.

Tests for differences in Sharpe ratios and return skewness

Sharpe ratios
The statistical significance of the differences between the Sharpe ratio or skewness of the SC trade
and those of trades from subsets is evaluated using bootstrap tests that follow Ledoit and Wolf (2008) or
Annaert, Van Osselaer, and Verstraete (2009). Skewness difference can be tested in a ”direct” bootstrap
that resamples from a distribution which respects the null hypothesis of no difference. In the case of
Sharpe ratios, their difference does not easily admit such a distribution, hence the approach followed is
”indirect” and resamples from the observed data. A version of this approach to comparing Sharpe ratios
has been applied recently, among others, in DeMiguel, Nogales, and Uppal (2014).
In implementing the test for a difference between Sharpe ratios, we depart in two minor ways from
Ledoit and Wolf (2008). First, we only consider the i.i.d. case (their Section 3.2.1). We have verified
that our carry trade return series have insignificant autocorrelations for lags up to 10. Furthermore, the
suggested block size selection procedure (their Algorithm 3.1) results consistently in a selected block
5

length of one, when using our data. Second, we consider one-sided bootstrap confidence intervals and
p-values, since our null hypothesis is that carry trades obtained with the enhancement rule do not improve
on the Sharpe ratio of the SC trade. We modify accordingly their equation (7).
Following the notation in Ledoit and Wolf (2008), let b
µS and b
µB denote the sample average returns of
a carry trade from some subset of the G-10 currencies and the SC trade, respectively, while bγS and bγB are
the sample second moments (uncentered) of the returns of these trades. Let also vb = (b
µS ,b
µB , bγS , bγB ), and
assume that

√
d
T (b
v − v) → (0, Ψ), where v is the population counterpart, T is sample length and Ψ is some

symmetric positive-definite matrix. The latter assumption holds under mild conditions. For the sample
b between the Sharpe ratios of the carry trade from a subset of the G-10 currencies and the SC
difference ∆
trade, and the deviation of this sample difference from the population value ∆, one can write

To test the null hypothesis ∆ ≤ 0, we bootstrap the returns of the two carry trades that are compared,

and consider the studentized random variable L = ∆s(∆−∗∆) , where ∆∗ is a difference in Sharpe ratios computed
b

with bootstrapped returns, and s(∆∗ ) is the corresponding standard error. Even though we bootstrap ”under
the alternative”, this procedure generates meaningful sampling variation under the null of no difference
between Sharpe ratios. Given the lack of autocorrelation in the carry trade return series, as noted above,
we use an i.i.d. bootstrap (5000 samples, with replacement and pairwise, to preserve a possible crosssectional correlation between the returns of the two carry trades). A p-value for the null is calculated as

6

the proportion of bootstrapped series for which:

(OA-8)

similar to equation (7) in Ledoit and Wolf (2008). These p-values are reported in Tables 2 and 3.

Skewness
To test for a difference in skewness, Annaert, Van Osselaer, and Verstraete (2009, page 277) first ”symmetrize” the compared return series, by appending to them the mirror images of the original observations
in terms of distance to the average return. The skewness (as well as any odd central moment) of these
modified returns is thus zero, and a bootstrap that resamples from them conforms to the null of no difference in skewness. Given that autocorrelation does not seem to be an issue in our series, we draw pairwise
from the modified series of the compared returns, and compute the p-value as the percentage of draws that
yield higher improvement on the benchmark skewness than that observed in the data. All bootstraps are
performed with 5000 draws.

OA-III

Differences in Sharpe ratios - accommodating the selection

The enhancement procedure described in Section III introduces a possible selection bias, which is not
accounted for by the bootstrap-based test described above, following Ledoit and Wolf (2008). To address
this issue, we suggest an alternative approach, and instead of bootstrapping the actual carry returns, we
adopt the following randomization procedure:
• at the end of month t keep the interest rate differentials as in the data, but assign to each of them at
random any of the ten returns for the following month t + 1.
• to each of these ten returns for month t + 1 add the same constant ct+1 . We call the returns obtained
in this way ”randomized” returns.
7

• the constant ct+1 can be positive or negative, and is chosen so that a carry trade that uses all ten
”randomized” returns would have exactly the same return as the actual SC trade for month t + 1.
Such a carry trade would choose the currencies to be long or short exactly as the SC trade, based on
sorting the same interest rate differentials.
• do this for all months in the sample, and repeat 1000 times, to obtain 1000 sets of ten ”randomized” return series, that correspond to the actual interest rate differentials. Given the large number
permutations of ten numbers, we do not bootstrap in addition the interest rate differentials.
• note that the constants ct+1 are different for different months, and that each ”randomized” return
corresponding to a particular interest rate differential is potentially very different from the actual
one. This approach may associate, for example, the JPY returns predominantly with the highest
interest rates in some randomization trials. However, the returns for each month, and hence the
Sharpe ratios of the carry trades with ten currencies (all 1000 with ”randomized” returns and the
actual SC trade) are exactly the same.
• on each of the 1000 sets of 10 time series reproduce the enhancement procedure described in Section
B. Based on the order of exclusion obtained from this procedure, identify for each of the 1000 sets
the currencies that would enter ”good” and ”bad” carry trades.
• in the full sample period construct trades with the least excluded three, five or seven currencies,
corresponding to our G1-G5 trades, and similarly with the most often excluded three, five or seven
currencies, corresponding to our B1-B5 trades.
For each of 1000 sets of 10 series of randomized carry trade returns, ∆∗ denotes the difference between
the annualized Sharpe ratio of a good carry trade (from three, five or seven currencies), constructed from
this set following the enhancement procedure, and the SC trade or the corresponding bad trade. As in

There is substantial bias in the comparison between the G1-G5 carry trades with the SC trade, with
the selection procedure adding 14% (for G1 and G5) or 16% (for G2 to G4) to the annualized Sharpe
b are even higher, and for
ratio. Yet, in every case the observed increases in the Sharpe ratio (denoted by ∆)
two out of the five good trades the observed Sharpe ratio is in the 10% right tail of the distribution of the
Sharpe ratios obtained under the selection procedure using the randomized (scrambled) currency returns.
When comparing the G1-G5 carry trades to the corresponding B1-B5 trades, the bias is relatively more
important, and in fact at least as large as the observed difference in Sharpe ratios for the G1 and G2 trades.
Only the G5 versus B5 comparison yields a Sharpe ratio of a good trade in the right tail (5.3%) of the
corresponding distribution under scrambled currency returns.
Of course, these observations alone do not constitute a proper test, since the randomization procedure
also can change the variability of the returns, and proper testing requires the use of a pivotal test statistic, such as a t-statistic. To create a proper test statistic, we modify the procedure in Ledoit and Wolf
9

(2008) by bias-correcting our sample Sharpe ratios, and using t-statistics from the empirical distribution
as in Appendix OA-II. The results, which also reproduce the relevant portion from Table 3, to facilitate
comparison are as follows:

Let’s first focus on the G1 trade. The t-statistic for its Sharpe ratio (0.51) being different from the
benchmark Sharpe ratio (0.31) has a p-value of 0.02. When we do the test using the randomized samples,
correcting for selection bias, the p-value increases to 0.18, and the difference is no longer statistically
significant. The p-values invariably increase for all carry trades, but remain significant at the 5% level
for G5, and at the 10% level for G3. For the good vs. bad carry trade comparison, the p-values increase
dramatically and only the G5 trade has a significantly higher Sharpe ratio than B5 (at the 10% level).

OA-IV

Factor models explaining good and bad carry trades

Tables OA-2 to OA-4 present the results separately for the standard carry trade (SC), the G1-G5 and
B1-B5 trades, and the GC and BC trades on average. The first column in Table OA-2 also shows the
respective average returns that are to be explained. For the G1-G5 trades these range between 1.7 and 4%
(annualized), and are all significantly different from zero at the 1% confidence level (with GMM standard
10

errors); for the GC trades they are on average 2%, and all but two out of 18 are significant at the 5% level.
In contrast, the average returns for the bad carry trades never exceed 1%, and are never significant, even
at the 10% level.
A. Model with equity volatility
The market factor (denoted MKT) in the model is proxied by the total return of the MSCI-World equity
index, in excess of the risk-free rate and expressed in USD. The equity volatility factor (EqVol) reflects
innovations in global equity volatilities, as constructed in Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan (2011), and
is taken from Verdelhan’s website (data until 12/2013). The interaction term (product of MKT and EqVol)
is denoted ”prod”, and exhibits highly negative skewness (-7.6).
The top panel of Table OA-2 reports results from time-series regressions of carry trade returns on
the three risk factors. The market betas are significant for both good and bad trades, and of comparable
magnitudes. However, the slope coefficient estimates on the product factor are typically negative, albeit
rarely significant for good trades, while they are positive, mostly much larger in magnitude, and almost
always significant at the 5% significance level for the bad trades. The F-test for no difference between
the average slope coefficients across the GC and BC trades rejects only for β prod . Given the high negative
skewness of the product factor, the large positive value of β prod implies that the market risk exposure of
the bad trades increases substantially in highly volatile times, helping to explain the negative skewness of
the bad trades as shown in Table 3.
From the perspective of a time-varying market beta, the large β prod implies, for example, that the
effective market beta for bad carry trades ranges between 0.025 and 0.083 for the 10-th and 90-th percentile
observations of EqVol (which are -0.67 and 0.59, respectively). This regime dependence is much weaker
for good carry trades, due to their smaller β prod estimates. The SC trade resembles the bad trades in this
respect, with a β prod that is positive and marginally significant (at the 10% level). Given that increases in

11

volatility tend to characterize periods of market downturns (the correlation between MKT and EqVol is
-0.24 in our sample), our findings attribute the under-performance in times of crisis mostly to bad carry
trades, while good trades are less affected.
The alpha’s obtained in the time-series regressions are difficult to interpret in the presence of nontraded factors. Therefore, we also perform GMM-based cross-sectional tests on the GC and BC return
cross sections, and show the results in the last two rows of the table. For the GC trades, the risk price for
the MKT factor is significant at the 5% level, while for the BC trades no risk price is significant. However,
the joint test does not reject for either of the two cross sections, delivering large p-values.
For further clarification, Panels A and B in Figure 4 plot model-predicted vs. actual average returns for
the GC and BC trades, where we see practically no relation for the BC trades, but a much better fit for the
GC trades, albeit with a few outliers. When we run a simple OLS regression of actual average returns on
a constant and the model-based expected returns, we obtain an R2 of 0.67 for the GC trades, and 0.29 for
the BC trades. The combined evidence suggests that this three-factor model does not adequately describe
the returns of the bad carry trades, but still saliently reveals the high exposure of these trades to the equity
market during high-volatility periods. In contrast, a significant price of risk for the market factor and
Figure 4 show the promise of the model to provide a risk-based interpretation of good carry trades.

B. Model with Up and Down equity market factors
Our interest in such a model is motivated both by the asymmetric patterns in carry trade returns documented above, and the recent work of Lettau, Maggiori, and Weber (2015), who find support for a similar
model pricing the joint cross section of several asset classes, including the returns of interest-rate-sorted
currency portfolios. Note that their model employs the market factor itself, together with a separate downmarket factor, whereas we use uncorrelated down- and up-market factors, which help sharpen the focus
on the asymmetric return behavior across good and bad carry trades (see also Ang, Chen, and Xing (2006,
12

Table 2)). Keeping the notation MKT for the total return of the MSCI-World equity index, in excess of
the risk-free rate and expressed in USD, the Down factor is taken to be min(MKT, 0), and the Up factor is
max(MKT, 0).
Table OA-3 shows that in the time-series regressions the slope coefficient estimates on the Down factor
are not statistically significant for about 70% of the good carry trades, but are significant for all but one
of the bad carry trades. The pattern is reversed for the Up factor, where the estimates are significant for
most of the good trades, but are in fact never significant for the bad trades, even at the 10% confidence
level. The magnitudes of the respective slope coefficients for good versus bad trades also differ largely, by
a factor of three or four, and these differences are highly significant, as evidenced by the reported p-values
from GMM tests for the equality of the average βDown or βU p across the 18 GC and BC trades. Additional
joint tests for pairwise equality between the corresponding coefficients for the GC and BC trades reject
with even smaller p-values. As above, the SC trade exhibits mixed features, with both slope coefficients
being significant.
The cross-sectional test results resemble those from Table OA-2, in that both risk prices λDown and λU p
are statistically significant for good trades, and highly insignificant for bad trades, while the tests for the
pricing errors being jointly equal to zero fail to reject, with high p-values. Moreover, the plots of modelbased versus actual average returns, similar to those in Figure 4) again reveal a reasonable fit for good
trades, but no apparent relation for bad trades, indicating that the model with down- and up-market factors
more adequately describes the returns of good carry trades. The important additional insight from this
model, however, is the striking dichotomy between the returns of good carry trades, which have relatively
high Up-market betas but decouple in bad times, and the returns of bad carry trades, which have relatively
high Down-market betas.

C. Fama-French three-factor model
13

Similar to Table OA-2 and in the same format, Table OA-4 illustrates the ability of the Fama-French
three-factor model to explain the returns of good and bad carry trades, and the main finding is that the
model does not perform well with respect to good carry trades.
The top panel of this table refers to time-series tests, and shows that the betas on the market factor
are economically small for these trades (0.05 on average), albeit often significant, while those on the
other two factors typically are not significantly different from zero. The adjusted R2 ’s in the time-series
regressions are relatively low, even sometimes negative, whereas the alphas are only about 5 to 30% lower
than the unconditional average carry trade returns, and still statistically significant for all G1-G5 trades
and 14 of the GC trades. On the other hand, for bad carry trades the betas on all three factors are higher and
statistically significant in most cases, and the R2 ’s are on average 0.12. A test for no difference between the
average slope coefficients across the 18 GC and BC trades rejects for βMKT and βSMB , at the 5% confidence
level. Interestingly, the model renders all alphas much lower than the respective average returns for the
bad carry trades, so that these trades can be qualified as ”negative alpha trades”, from the perspective
of this model. The model also explains a large part of the SC trade’s average returns, with statistically
significant factor loadings and a high R2 . The time-series tests therefore suggest that the good carry trades
pose a problem for this model, whereas the SC trade and the bad trades at least are meaningfully exposed
to standard risk factors. In addition, a test for alphas being jointly equal to zero does not reject for both
the GC and BC sets of carry trades, with p-values above 0.30.
The last two lines of the table show results from GMM-based cross-sectional tests, using the GC and
BC trades as test assets. The estimates of the risk prices λ are all statistically insignificant, except for
λMKT for the GC trades, while the tests for the pricing errors being jointly equal to zero exhibit p-values
above 0.70. The results for the risk prices thus cast doubt on the explanatory power of the Fama-French
three-factor model for the BC trades as well, whereas the joint test results may reflect power issues.

Table OA-1
Currency volatility vs. good carry trades as currency market pricing factors
This table differs from Table 4 only in one aspect: instead of the HMLFX factor, we now use the currency volatility factor as in Menkhoff,
Sarno, Schmeling, and Schrimpf (2012) and denote it ”FXVol”. To obtain this factor, our monthly exchange rate volatility proxy is the
average across currencies and days in the month of the absolute daily log changes of the exchange rates of the G-10 currencies against the
USD, using mid-quotes. Next, we take first differences of the volatility proxy. Finally, we regress these first differences on the percentage
monthly returns (in USD) of long positions in the G-10 currencies (except the USD), calculated as in equation (1), but using mid-quotes.
The factor we use is the fitted value from this regression (multiplied by 100).

R2

This table reports test results for a three-factor model with a market factor (denoted MKT), an equity volatility factor (EqVol) and the product of MKT
and EqVol. MKT is the return of the MSCI-World equity index (total returns in excess of the risk-free rate, in USD). EqVol is the equity volatility
factor, used in Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan (2011) and available at Verdelhan’s website until 12/2013, and the product of MKT and EqVol is
denoted ”prod”. The test assets are the SC and good and bad carry trades. For the GC and BC trades the ”avg. ret.” column shows the average of
their average returns, and the remaining columns show similarly averages of the regression coefficients and adjusted R2 ’s (in percent). Standard errors
are estimated with GMM and account for one Newey-West lag. The first (second) number in parentheses shows how many of the 18 corresponding
individual estimates are significant at the 5% (10%) confidence level. For example, none of the average returns for the 18 BC trades is significant even
at the 10% level. In curly brackets are shown p-values for a test of equality of the respective average slope coefficients across the GC vs. BC trades,
accounting for heteroskedasticity and one Newey-West lag. The last two lines show, similar to Table 4, results from cross-sectional GMM estimations
of the model on the GC and BC carry trades. The sample period is 12/1984 to 12/2013. The reported average returns, α’s and λ’s are annualized and in
percent.

Economic regressions
The table shows results from multivariate regressions of various carry trade returns on three macro variables: global equity volatility, as in
LRV (2011), industrial production growth in the OECD countries, and the residual from regressing the US industrial production growth on
that of the OECD. The last three columns show the change in the dependent variable for one standard deviation change in each regressor,
all else equal. Intercepts and sensitivities are reported annualized and in percent, and adjusted R2 ’s are in percent.

Figure 4: Average vs. model-based expected returns
Circles with no fill (large black dots) plot model-based expected monthly returns versus average monthly
returns (annualized and in percent) for the GC (BC) set of 18 carry trades, as described in Table 3. The
model based returns refer to the three-factor model with a market factor (MKT), an equity volatility factor
(EqVol) and the product of MKT and EqVol, and are estimated, for each trade, as the product of its timeseries slope estimates (β) with respect to the factors in the model, and the corresponding estimates of the
factor risk prices λ, as shown in Table OA-2. The bottom right corner of each plot shows the R2 obtained
in regressing average returns on model-based returns (with a constant). The sample period is 12/1984 to
12/2013.
