Theory

Unemployment behavior with finite duration UI has been analyzed in
several ways.

In his model,

individuals maximize the present value of expected utility, where utility is a

function of income and leisure.

There is no saving in the model; individuals

A stationary known wage offer distribution is assumed

and the arrival rate of job offers is constant over time for a given search
intensity.

Mortensen's escape rate or hazard is proportional

to s[l-F(wfl,

where s is the search intensity, w is the reservation wage and F is the
cumulative distribution of wage offers.

1The reservation wage is determinedby the equality between the value of
being employed at one's reservation wage and being unemployed (equation 9(a)
in Mortensen (1977)). The reservation wage must decline as exhaustion
approaches since the value of being unemployed drops. Search intensity is
determinedby the equality of the marginal cost of search (lost leisure) and
the marginal benefit of search (equation 9(b) in Mortensen (1977)). Since the
marginal benefit of search increases when the value of unemployment declines,
search intensity increases.
2The figure is drawn assuming the marginal utility of leisure is
independent of income. If leisure and income are complements (substitutes),
the hazard is discontinuous at T and higher (lower) after T than shown.

However, recall dates

likely depend on individual or typical UI benefit lengths.

If workers are

bound to firms by implicit contracts, moving costs, specific human capital, or
other reasons, firms have an incentive to base recall decisions on the
length

of UI benefits.
Mortensen (1987) provides a model which has this characteristic.

He

analyzes a joint wealth maximizing model of job separations with firms facing

transitory demand changes and limited duration of unemployment benefits. The
discrete change in the flow value of being unemployed when benefits are
exhausted yields the prediction that many firms may recall laid-off workers
around the benefit exhaustionpoint.

Sider studies the distribution of reported incomplete

Additionally,

the UI parameters, benefit level and duration, are often missing

from other data sources.

The CWBH data provide accurate information on these

key variables.

Results

The effects of unemployment insurance are measured using functions of the
benefit level and the time until benefits lapse.

The log of weekly benefits

and pre-Ul income are included in most specifications.

Similar results are

obtained when the level of benefits and income are used and when the UI
replacement

ratio is tried.

High benefits are expected to decrease the hazard

because they lower the opportunity cost of search and leisure.

High previous

earnings are expected to raise the hazard since the cost of unemployment in
terms of lost wages is higher and because high earnings are likely correlated

with unobserved job finding ability.

For this reason, estimates from specification

While the spike in the hazard just before exhaustion is striking, few
spells last sufficiently long to be affected by the spike.

Almost all of the

24Hamermesh (1977) concludes that "the best estimate--if one chooses a
single figure--is that a 10-percentage point increase in the gross
replacement rate leads to an increase in the duration of insured unemployment
of about half a week when labor markets are tight."
Danziger, Haveman and
Plotnick (1981) eport a wide range of estimates, but suggest that Moffitt and
Nicholson (1982) offers the most reliable estimates. Their study found that a
10-percentage point increase in the replacement rate was associated with about
a one week increase in the average length of unemployment spells. The
etimates in Solon (1985) imply between a half a week and a full week increase
in mean durations from a 10-percentage point increase in the replacement rate.

aThis empirical hazard differs from the Kaplan-Meier
hazard with the time axis reversed for two reasons. First,
people begin with different lengths of benefits. Second,
the time until benefits lapse does not always decrease by
one each week, since the length of benefits often changes.
Thus, the accounting identity given in footnote 8 will not
hold and a person may appear more than once in the ri•sk set
for a given week.

aThe confidence intervals are calculated using a
The
suggestion in Kalblfleisch and Prentice (1980).
hazard estimates and the standard errors are transformed to insure that the confidence intervals lie
between 0 and 1. The normal approximatton used to
calculate confidence intervals is more reasonable
for the transformed hazard, especially for values of
the hazard close to 0 or 1.

aThe confidence intervals are calculated using a
suggestion in Kalblfleisch and Prentice (1980). The

hazard estimates and the standard errors are transformed to insure that the confidence intervals lie
between 0 and 1. The normal approximation used to
calculate confidence intervals is more reasonable
for the transformed hazard, especially for values of
the hazard close to 0 or 1.
