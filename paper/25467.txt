ABSTRACT
In contrast to bonds, cov-lite loans do not require SEC registration and are not subject to
securities laws. We show that this distinction plays an important role in firms’ choice between
funding through cov-lite loans and bonds and helps understand why the market share of cov-lite
loans has been so high in recent normal times. Compared to cov-heavy loans, cov-lite loans are
closer substitutes for bonds in that they have similar covenants, have tighter bid-ask spreads, have
more trading, and are more likely to be used to refinance bonds than cov-heavy loans.

Introduction
There is a considerable literature that examines theoretically and empirically the choice of firms

between borrowing from public markets and from banks. In this literature, reviewed in the next section,
bank loans differ from bonds because banks monitor the borrower through covenants and have information
that capital market investors do not have. This literature cannot explain why the typical leveraged loan
outstanding is a cov-lite loan. Like bonds but unlike traditional bank loans, cov-lite loans do not have
maintenance covenants. The absence of maintenance covenants means that the lender cannot monitor the
loan at regular intervals, so that compared to a traditional bank loan, a cov-lite loan is an unmonitored loan.
Partly or mostly because of data availability, the literature has heavily focused on choices made by
public firms. We argue in this paper that the literature misses an important dimension of the choices made
by firms. A firm can only issue public bonds if it registers these bonds with the SEC and commits to regular
filings. Hence, borrowing from the public markets would change drastically the public reporting
requirements of a private firm. In contrast, borrowing in the form of a loan would have no impact on these
requirements. Further, because of the Trust Indenture Act, the firms that issue bonds publicly face severe
limitations in restructuring these bonds. Such legal limitations do not exist for bank loans (but they may be
included in loan contracts as discussed in Demiroglu and James (2015)). Lastly, bonds are securities but
loans are not, so that bonds issued by non-registrants, such as bonds issued pursuant to Rule 144a, are
subject to securities laws.
We investigate in this paper whether the different legal status of bonds and loans is an important factor
in firms’ decisions to borrow in the form of loans or through issuance of bonds and in how loans are
structured. If a firm borrows in the form of a loan but would prefer to raise funds through a bond issuance
if not for the legal status of bonds, we would expect that firm to structure the loan so that it would be as
similar to a bond as possible. We call the motivation to borrow in the form of loans because of their legal
status the legal status motivation for loan issuance. We find that the legal status motivation plays an
important role in firms’ use of banks to raise funds through cov-lite loans and helps understand the dramatic

1

growth of the cov-lite market following the global financial crisis (GFC). If firms value bond-like loans,
we would expect the design of these loans to evolve so that they become better substitutes for bonds. We
show that cov-lite loans have many features of bonds.
Though we show the importance of legal considerations in firms’ loan and bond issuance decisions, we
do not imply that other considerations raised in the literature are not relevant and provide further support
for the role of some of these considerations. In particular, our evidence that cov-heavy loans have higher
credit spreads than cov-lite loans for private firms is supportive of theories that covenants may have adverse
selection costs for investors (Parlour and Plantin (2008)), that covenants may be costly because of
coordination costs (Becker and Ivashina (2017)), and that monitoring may be better allocated to tranches
of loans that do not involve institutional investors (Berlin, Nini, and Yu (2020)).
There is now a large literature documenting the drop in IPOs in the 2000s and the decrease in the
willingness of firms to be publicly listed (see Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2013, 2017) and Gao, Ritter, and
Zhu (2013)). It is often argued that firms shy from the public markets in part because going public changes
their disclosure obligations and puts them under the regulatory umbrella of the SEC. If the change in
disclosure obligations leads firms to avoid going public, we would also expect private firms to refrain from
issuing bonds publicly and would expect public firms that might want to go private to do the same. The role
of SEC registration requirements in the decision of firms to borrow through loans instead of bonds is largely
obscured by the fact that firm-level data is available almost exclusively for SEC registered firms. Any
analysis of the decision to borrow through bonds or loans that uses a conventional database such as
Compustat is limited to SEC registered firms. Yet, though the typical issuer of a bond is an SEC registered
firm, the typical borrower through a highly levered loan is a private firm.
Historically, loans differed from bonds because loans were illiquid and held by banks that monitored
borrowers while bonds were liquid and there was no bank-like monitoring for bond issuers. These sharp
distinctions between loans and bonds started to disappear in the 1980s and the disappearance has
accelerated. Now, firms that do not qualify for an investment-grade rating can borrow through loans that
resemble bonds along many dimensions. Cov-lite loans enable firms to borrow in a way that is very similar

2

to issuing a bond but without having to register the bond with the SEC and be subject to the disclosure
requirements of securities laws and the Trust Indenture Act. The most important difference between covlite loans and bonds is that bonds are rarely secured while cov-lite loans almost always are. The
development of cov-lite loans has made it cheaper for firms to stay private in that it has made the financing
opportunities of private firms closer to the financing opportunities of public firms.
If covenant-lite loans are advantageous for firms because they effectively constitute bond financing
without the disclosure requirements and without the restructuring restrictions of public bonds, we would
expect cov-lite loans to be relatively more favored by firms not traded on exchanges and by firms that are
more likely to exit exchanges. We find that this is the case. Firms that borrow through cov-lite loans are
less likely to be public firms than firms that borrow through cov-heavy loans or bonds. Further, a public
firm that borrows through a cov-lite loan is much more likely to exit public markets than a firm that borrows
through a cov-heavy loan or a bond. Strikingly, firms refinancing a bond are more likely to borrow through
a cov-lite loan than through a cov-heavy loan. Again, this evidence is supportive of the view that bonds and
cov-lite loans are substitutes in a way that bonds and cov-heavy loans are not.
By borrowing through a cov-lite loan, a firm escapes disclosure requirements that it would have if it
issued a public bond. However, for the cov-lite loan to be a substitute for issuing a public bond, it should
be tradeable like a public bond and investors should require a similar credit spread for cov-lites and bonds
adjusting for risk differences. Because loans are secured while bonds typically are not, we expect credit
spreads to be lower for loans than for bonds. We find that this is the case. One way to interpret this result
is that, if the main differences between cov-lite loans and registered bonds are the SEC registration of bonds
and the fact that cov-lite loans are secured, investors place higher value on the fact that cov-lite loans are
secured than on the benefits that accrue to bonds from registration. We show that the difference in credit
spreads can plausibly be explained fully by the fact that loans are secured and bonds are not.
With a cov-heavy loan, lenders monitor the borrower and hence have information that outsiders do not
have. As a result, an adverse selection problem arises that can make the market for a loan less liquid or
illiquid as shown in Parlour and Plantin (2008). In contrast, the lack of maintenance covenants with cov-

3

lite loans reduces the adverse selection problem that results from the lenders being better informed and
hence increases the liquidity of the loans. To the extent that institutional cov-lite loans are often
accompanied by a bank-held cov-heavy loan in the issuer’s capital structure (Berlin, Nini, and Yu, 2020),
cov-lite issuance does not necessarily result in less bank monitoring. However, monitoring is costly.
Bondholders do not have to expend these costs and cov-lites are designed so that the holders of the
institutional tranche do not have to expend these costs either. This is because the cov-lite structure of the
institutional tranche amounts to a pre-commitment not to acquire private information and not to monitor.
Such a pre-commitment makes the cov-lite tranche more comparable to a bond and less informationally
sensitive to private information than a cov-heavy tranche (Gorton and Pennacchi, 1990; Dang, Gorton, and
Holmstrom, 2019).
Though we cannot directly compare the liquidity of cov-lite loans and the liquidity of high yield bonds,
we show that the bid-ask spreads for cov-lite loans are not out of line with some estimates of trading costs
for high-yield bonds. We also compare the credit spreads and liquidity of cov-heavy and cov-lite loans.
Consistent with bank monitoring creating an adverse selection problem, we find that for private firms covlites have a lower credit spread than cov-heavy loans controlling for when the loan is entered into, for the
characteristics of the loan, and for the issuer’s credit rating and industry. Importantly, however, this credit
spread difference could also be explained by issuer or issuance differences that are not observable to us. As
expected, we find that cov-lite loans are substantially more liquid than cov-heavy loans. In particular, covlite loans start trading more quickly, have a higher break price, have lower bid-ask spreads, and trade more
often. Consistent with an adverse selection problem, this liquidity advantage is greater for private firms,
which tend to be more opaque.
As noted by Becker and Ivashina (2017), there is a cyclical pattern in cov-lite issuance. Specifically,
cov-lite issuance increased sharply before the global financial crisis (GFC), essentially disappeared during
the GFC and its immediate aftermath, and then increased at a fast pace. Not surprisingly, as cov-lite issuance
fell sharply during the GFC, it also decreased sharply with the COVID-19 crisis (see IMF, 2020). The
existence of such a pattern suggests that the costs and benefits of issuing cov-lite loans vary depending on

4

business conditions. Diamond, Hu, and Rajan (2019) build a model where the value of maintenance
covenants falls when liquidity is high as lenders are more concerned about the market value of a firm’s
assets than about their ability to appropriate its cash flows. We account for business conditions through
year indicator variables and through a variable that measures the intensity of cov-lite issuance. We find as
expected that a firm’s probability of issuing a cov-lite loan increases when cov-lite issuance is more
prevalent.
Our paper contributes to four literatures. First, there is a literature on the decrease in the number of
listed firms. Our paper shows that firms’ listing status and plans concerning that listing status if they are
public affect their choice of debt financing and the structure of debt markets. The development of cov-lite
loans is one factor that makes it less costly for firms to stay private or to delist voluntarily. Second, there is
a literature that investigates how firms decide between borrowing through loans and through bond issuance.
By combining bond-like features with the legal status advantages of a loan, cov-lite loans significantly
expand the menu of choices available to firms. Third, there is a literature on loan trading and its implications
for banks and borrowers. We show that for firms with the highest information asymmetries, namely the
private firms, the adverse selection problem associated with covenants discussed in the literature may
explain why cov-lite loans have lower credit spreads than cov-heavy loans. Fourth, there is an emerging
literature on cov-lite loans. This literature so far focuses on the choice between cov-lite loans and covheavy loans as opposed to the use of cov-lite loans as substitutes for bonds. We show that the liquidity of
cov-lite loans is close or equivalent to the liquidity of bonds.
We review the relevant literatures in the next section before developing our hypotheses. After
presenting our data in section 3, we examine substitutability between bond issuance and cov-lite financing
in section 4. In section 5, we examine differences in credit spreads and liquidity between cov-lite loans and
bonds. In section 6, we show that cov-lite loans and cov-heavy loans differ in such a way that cov-lite loans
are better substitutes for bonds. We conclude in section 7.

Review of the literature and hypothesis development
In this section, we briefly review the relevant literatures and develop our main hypotheses. We first

discuss the theoretical and empirical literature on the choice between raising funds through bank loans and
through bond issuance. We then turn to the small literature on cov-lite loans before formulating our main
hypotheses.

2.1. The choice between bank loans and bonds
Diamond (1991) provides a theory of the choice between bank loans and bonds. In his model, lenders
are concerned about moral hazard but this concern differs across firms. The concern is more important for
young firms than for firms that have developed a reputation as good borrowers. When the concern about
moral hazard is important enough, firms borrow through bank loans that are monitored in contrast to bonds.
The distinction between monitored and unmonitored sources of finance is central to the literature. It
would be inefficient for individual bondholders to monitor firms as each bondholder is likely to hold a small
fraction of the bond issue (Berlin and Loeys (1988)). If monitoring is important, it is more efficient for a
specialist to do so, namely a financial intermediary, and for investors to invest in the financial intermediary
rather than in securities issued by corporate borrowers (Diamond (1984)). Covenants provide incentives for
banks to monitor and enable them to take actions to reduce the risk of their loans (Rajan and Winton (1995)).
Coordination among bondholders makes renegotiation difficult. In addition, the Trust Indenture Act
and bankruptcy laws complicate renegotiation by diffuse bondholders even more. In contrast, a loan held
by a bank or a handful of lenders can be renegotiated more easily (but loan contracts may remove some of
that flexibility as discussed in Demiroglu and James (2015)). Relatedly, specialized lenders such as banks
have incentives to invest in making sure that they make the right decisions when a borrower is in distress,
namely whether to renegotiate the loan or liquidate the firm (Chemmanur and Fulghieri (1994)).
Fama (1985) distinguishes between inside and outside debt. Bank loans are inside debt in that banks
have access to information that public investors do not have. Banks acquire that information in a variety of

6

ways that improve their ability to monitor. The fact that a bank has access to information that enables it to
monitor more efficiently means that it will be willing to lend to a borrower with which it has a relationship
in states of the world where arms-length investors will not be willing to lend (Bolton and Freixas (2000),
Rajan (1992)). However, when banks have inside information, they effectively can hold up borrowers
(Rajan (1992)). Consequently, firms may choose to have both bank debt and bonds in their capital structure.
The existing literature generally predicts that the safest firms issue bonds, less safe firms borrow from
banks, and the least safe firms cannot borrow at all. Empirical evidence supports this view as Denis and
Mihov (2003) find that “the primary determinant of the choice of debt source is the credit quality of the
issuer.”
More recent literature has emphasized business conditions and loan supply effects in the choice between
bank loans and bonds. Becker and Ivashina (2014) show evidence that firms that can borrow both from
banks and from the capital markets switch to the capital markets for their funding when lending standards
by banks are tight and bank share prices are low. Erel, Julio, Kim, and Weisbach (2011) show that the fund
raising of non-investment grade borrowers is pro-cyclical, which implies that these borrowers raise fewer
funds in tough times. Further, recent empirical literature shows that the riskiest firms often borrow from
non-bank lenders (Chernenko, Erel, and Prilmeier (2018)).

2.2. The choice of covenants
The existing literature examines the determinants of the strictness of bank loan covenants for firms. A
number of papers conclude that riskier firms have stricter covenants, which is consistent with the literature
on bank loans discussed above (e.g., Berlin and Mester (1992), Billett, King, and Mauer (2007), and Rauh
and Sufi (2010)). The literature also shows that maintenance covenants are frequently violated and that
these violations have material implications for firm policies and firm performance (e.g., Chava and Roberts
(2008), and Nini, Smith, and Sufi (2012)). Roberts and Sufi (2009) show that over 90% of contracts with
maturities of more than one year have a major contract term renegotiated. When a major contract term is
changed, the syndicate participants generally have to be unanimous in approving the change. One would

7

expect, therefore, that the covenant package depends on the size of the syndicate. Saavendra (2018) shows
that it does. Loans with larger syndicates have fewer covenants that reduce flexibility in good states, such
as covenants limiting capital expenditures. Firms with longer relationships with lenders have looser
covenants (Prilmeier (2017)). As for the literature on the volume of bank loans, the literature explores the
role of supply effects on covenant packages. Murfin (2012) shows that banks experiencing recent defaults
tighten the covenant packages, which he attributes to lenders reassessing their screening ability.

2.3. Why cov-lite loans?
The literature on cov-lite loans is extremely limited. Ayotte and Bolton (2011) model the choice
between cov-heavy and cov-lite loans. In their model, loans are securitized, so that investors have to expend
reading costs to learn about loans. With a cov-lite loan, reading costs are low, but investors assume that any
terms they do not know are adverse to them. With a cov-heavy loan, reading costs are high, but investors
have lower moral hazard costs. In good times, expected moral hazard costs are lower, so that cov-lite loans
are more advantageous. In their model, cov-lite loans are more liquid than cov-heavy loans because of
lower reading costs. The model predicts pro-cyclical issuance of cov-lite loans. It also predicts that cov-lite
loans have higher credit spreads and are more likely to be securitized.
Billett, Elkamhi, Popov, and Pungaliya (2016) use a different approach based on the existence of two
agency problems with loans. One problem is between the borrower and the lender; the other problem is
between the bank and the non-bank investors. In their model, the number of covenants increases as the bank
participation in a loan falls, but only up to some threshold level of bank participation. The logic for this
result is that the bank’s incentive to monitor falls as it holds a smaller share of the loan. An increase in the
number of covenants increases the bank’s incentive to monitor. However, if the bank’s skin in the game is
really low, it may be optimal for the loan to be a cov-lite loan as the monitoring costs may be too high
compared to the benefits of monitoring for some types of loans. The bank’s skin in the game will be pushed
down if there is a lot of investor demand for loans or if the cost of capital for banks is high. In their model,
cov-lite loans have higher spreads than cov-heavy loans. The authors find that the value-weighted spread

8

on a deal involving a cov-lite loan is higher and that loans sponsored by private equity groups are more
likely to be cov-lite loans because these groups have reputation incentives that reduce moral hazard risks
for investors.
Becker and Ivashina (2017) test three explanations for the growth of cov-lite loans. The first explanation
is that borrowers, following the crisis, learned that renegotiation costs are high and are willing to pay to
obtain unmonitored loans. The second explanation is that coordination costs for monitoring when a loan is
held by many institutional investors are high, so that it can be optimal to have an unmonitored loan. The
third explanation is that investors are chasing yields, so that they would rather have a higher yield with
fewer protections. They find results that are strongly supportive of the coordination cost hypothesis. Berlin,
Nini, and Yu (2020) investigate a large set of levered loan contracts. Like Becker and Ivashina (2017), they
conclude that cov-lite loans reduce renegotiation frictions. They argue that the typical levered loan package
with a cov-lite loan also has a cov-heavy tranche not held by institutional investors. This tranche has the
traditional monitoring associated with banks. Hence, cov-lite packages put the lenders with a comparative
advantage in monitoring, namely the banks, in charge of renegotiation.
Lastly, Diamond, Hu, and Rajan (2019) develop a theory where in boom times firm leverage depends
mostly on the value of firm assets as debt can be repaid out of the proceeds from selling firm assets. In
contrast, when liquidity goes away, loans are repaid out of cash flows and the pledgeability of cash flows
becomes critical. Maintenance covenants increase pledgeability of cash flows, so that we would expect
these covenants to be more important in periods of low liquidity. This theory suggests that covenant-lite
loans are more likely to be issued in periods of high liquidity.

2.4. Hypotheses development
We observe equilibrium outcomes where a firm borrows either through a bond or through a levered
loan. If the firm borrows through a levered loan, the loan either has maintenance covenants or it does not.
For an equilibrium outcome to occur, there has to be an intersection of a demand curve for funds of a

9

particular type from the borrower and of a supply curve for that type of funds from investors. In this section,
we develop two hypotheses we investigate in the remainder of the paper. The first hypothesis is that a firm’s
decision to borrow through a cov-lite loan instead of a bond is affected by the legal status of loans and
bonds (legal status hypothesis). The second hypothesis is that the cost of choosing to borrow with a covlite loan instead of a bond is low because cov-lite loans are designed so that they have attributes that make
them acceptable substitutes for bonds for a subset of institutional investors (investor substitution
hypothesis).

2.4.a. The legal status hypothesis
The existing literature focuses on the optimal choice of covenants conditional on the financing taking
place through a loan, but we focus here on the choice between cov-lite loan issuance and bond issuance.
Cov-lite loans are unmonitored loans and hence are more similar to bonds than to traditional monitored
bank loans. If a loan and a bond have the same covenant package, a critical difference between a loan and
a bond is that, under the current regulatory regime, a bond is a security while an investment in a syndicated
loan is not (de Fontenay (2014)). If a bond is issued publicly, the issuer is subject to periodic disclosure
requirements. Further, the bond is a security subject to the anti-fraud provisions of securities laws. As
discussed later, a bond can also be issued subject to Rule 144a. With such an issuance, the bond is subject
to securities laws but the issuer is not subject to periodic disclosures because of having issued the bond.
If a firm is a public firm subject to SEC regulation, issuing a bond publicly does not change its
disclosure obligations. Hence, for such a firm, the fact that a loan is not a security has a limited disclosure
benefit unless the firm expects that it might choose to deregister during the life of the bond. If the firm
decides that it is better off private, it likely would have to buy back the bonds to avoid periodic disclosures,
so that it would then have to raise funds through a leveraged loan. It is obviously easier for a firm that
believes it likely that it will go private to raise funds through a loan in the first place.
Being subject to securities laws has both costs and benefits for firms issuing bonds. Investors benefit
from greater protections, which can lead to a lower cost of funds. However, the public disclosures required

10

in the bond offering and the subsequent periodic disclosures have costs for firms. First, there are
administrative costs. Second, there are potential competitive costs, as a firm may have to disclose
information publicly that is useful to its current or potential competitors. If a private firm issues a bond to
the public that requires it to register the offering with the SEC, it essentially becomes a public firm. Some
firms choose to become public through bond issuance. Glushkov, Khorana, Rau, and Zhang (2018) find
that 18% of firms going public do so through bond issuance from 1987 to 2016. Public firms are subject to
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which imposes further obligations on firms. These obligations are controversial
and many firms view them as costly. Lastly, and importantly, a lender through a loan can receive
confidential information from a borrower that is not public information. An investor through a bond cannot
receive such information.
The typical public firm is a firm listed on a major exchange. As shown by Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz
(2017), the propensity of firms to be listed in the US has fallen dramatically since 1997. Such a decrease in
the propensity of firms to list must be the result of a decrease in the benefit from being listed and/or of an
increase in the costs of being listed. If being public has become less attractive, it should make bond
financing less attractive compared to bank loans for non-public firms. Firms that want to stop being SEC
registered also would want to finance themselves with bank loans rather than bond issuance. If firms prefer
bank loans to bond financing to avoid being SEC registered, we would expect them to choose bank loans
that resemble bonds if such bank loans are available. Contractually, cov-lite loans are more similar to bonds
than to typical bank loans. Like bonds, they do not have maintenance covenants.
This leads to our first hypothesis:

H1. Legal status motivation for loan issuance. Everything else equal, firms that find the legal status
of bonds to be costly relative to the legal status of loans are more likely to borrow through loans than
bonds and if they borrow through a loan are more likely to do so using a cov-lite loan.

11

Empirically, an important dimension along which cov-lite loans often but not always differ from bonds
is that most bonds are unsecured (see Benmelech, Kumar, and Rajan (2020) for the decline of use of
collateral in bonds) and cov-lite loans are almost always secured. For borrowers, putting up collateral
against borrowing is costly as it reduces financial flexibility (see Benmelech, Kumar, and Rajan (2020)).
Hence, one might be concerned that if cov-lite borrowers have to put up collateral against their borrowing
but bond issuers do not, this makes cov-lite loans less attractive compared to bonds. It is important to note
that a cov-lite loan being secured while a bond is not secured is not a defining contractual difference
between the two borrowing instruments because bonds can be secured. In our sample, 16% of bonds are
secured. The advantage of security for a cov-lite loan is that it enhances a benefit of the cov-lite loan, which
is the lack of monitoring costs. Having access to collateral means that the investors in a cov-lite loan do not
have to be as informed about the firm than they would otherwise have to be. Though allowing a borrower
to modify the collateral would be difficult in a bond because of the large number of investors, it is much
easier for a loan. Consequently, the loss of financial flexibility that arises because of collateralization may
be quite limited with a cov-lite loan.
For firms, cov-heavy loan issuances and Rule 144a issuances are ways to borrow without having to
register with the SEC. Cov-lite loans could be poor substitutes for bonds compared to cov-heavy loans for
issuers. Cov-heavy loans potentially benefit from monitoring that cov-lite loans do not benefit from. 1 This
monitoring makes the loans safer to the extent that coordination costs, free-riding costs, and adverse
selection costs are not too high. Hence, cov-heavy loans could have lower spreads than cov-lite loans, which
would weaken our hypothesis that legal status is an important consideration in the decision to borrow
through a cov-lite loan. Alternatively, firms can issue bonds without having to register the issue as a public
issuance using a Rule 144a offering. A Rule 144a bond differs from a loan in that it is a security subject to

1

Even if the cov-lite loan is accompanied by a cov-heavy tranche, there may be frictions that limit the effectiveness
of bank monitoring from the institutional investors’ perspective. For example, Billett et al. (2016) find that the bank
revolver accompanying a cov-lite often has so-called springing covenants that are inactive until the borrower draws
down a certain proportion of the line of credit.

12

securities laws. Again, if the credit spread on a Rule 144a bond were to be sufficiently low compared to a
cov-lite loan, this would weaken our hypothesis.

2.4.b. Investor substitution hypothesis
Historically, public bond markets met large financing needs of companies. In the 19th century, the bond
market was a major source of funding for railroads. Though small firms could meet their financing needs
through bank loans, eventually, as a firm became large and established, it would have to access the bond
market. Banks face regulatory limits and risk management limits on how much they can lend to an
individual firm. If the amounts that firms can borrow through bank loans are smaller than what they can
borrow through the bond market, then firms can prefer loans to bonds because of their legal status only up
to a given size. When banks are limited in how much of a loan they can hold, they can sell parts of the loan
to non-bank investors. For the amount raised through loans to be comparable to amounts that can be raised
through bonds, banks have to make investment in loans attractive to institutional investors so that some
investors are willing to buy positions in loans instead of bonds. 2 However, these loans cannot be structured
in such a way as to make them much more expensive than bonds, since from the borrower’s perspective
expensive loans would be poor substitutes for bonds besides the legal status difference.
Loans are better substitutes for bonds for institutional investors concerned about liquidity if they are
tradable under conditions similar to bonds. The literature on the trading of loans predicts that when banks
have valuable non-public information loan trading is limited because of the resulting adverse selection
problem (Parlour and Plantin (2008)). With cov-lite loans, institutional lenders have less information than
with cov-heavy loans because they do not monitor maintenance covenants. Although banks could hold a
cov-heavy tranche issued by the same borrower so that monitoring benefits still apply (Berlin, Nini, and
Yu, 2020), the banks do not participate in trading the institutional tranche, except potentially as market

2

It is important to note that there are institutional investment vehicles such as CLOs or certain mutual funds that are
contractually or legally restricted to either investing in loans or bonds. However, substitution can still occur at the
level of the institutional investors that invest in these vehicles, and substitutability of loans vs. bonds will affect flows
from these end investors into vehicles that either invest in loans or bonds.

13

makers. With this structure, institutional investors have no incentive to monitor the lender, so that they do
not have to expend monitoring costs. The lack of maintenance covenants therefore amounts to a precommitment not to monitor. With this pre-commitment, the cov-lite loan is less information sensitive than
a cov-heavy loan. As a result, the cov-lite loan is more similar to a bond than it would be if it were more
information sensitive and made it optimal for its holders to monitor. In this sense, the cov-lite loan can be
structured similarly to a bond that may or may not be accompanied by a traditional loan, allowing the
bondholders to trade in debt that is less informationally sensitive while the bank monitors the information
sensitive debt. Hence, we would expect cov-lite loans to be more liquid than cov-heavy loans. Note that if
cov-heavy loans were more liquid, then this would suggest that in some dimensions cov-heavy loans would
be better substitutes for bonds.
If cov-lites are designed to be substitutes for registered bonds for investors who do not monitor, we
would expect these loans to be rated since bonds typically are, revealing a preference of such investors for
information production by rating agencies. Further, evidence that investors require a higher credit spread
for cov-lites than comparable bonds would suggest that bonds have advantages for investors that cov-lites
do not have since otherwise we would expect cov-lites to have lower credit spreads. The difficulty in
comparing yields for bonds and yields for cov-lites is that cov-lite loans, as already discussed, are typically
secured but bonds are not. Consequently, we would expect cov-lites to have a lower spread compared to
bonds as long as investors do not value the benefits of securities laws more than they value the fact that
cov-lites are secured. It follows from this that evidence that cov-lites trade at a higher spread than bonds
would be evidence against our substitution hypothesis.
The substitution hypothesis is about cov-lites being designed so that some investors are willing to hold
cov-lite loans instead of bonds without asking for a costly premium to do so. Obviously, some institutional
investors cannot switch between bonds and loans because their investment mandate restricts them to invest
either in loans, such as CLOs, or in bonds, but the hypothesis only requires that there are investors who
view cov-lite loans and bonds as substitutes.
Our second hypothesis is therefore:

14

H2. Investor substitution hypothesis. If cov-lite loans are designed to be substitutes for bonds for
investors so that firms would not have to pay investors more for borrowing through a cov-lite loan than
a bond, we would expect cov-lite loans to be rated, to trade more similarly to bonds than cov-heavy
loans, and their credit spreads should not be higher than those of bonds.

The data
We create two samples: a leveraged loan sample and a speculative grade debt sample. The leveraged

loan sample includes 5,560 loans by US issuers on the US leveraged loan market from January 1, 2005
through April 30, 2015. 3 Our main data source is Capital IQ Leveraged Commentary and Data (LCD). The
sample is limited to deals that LCD reports as completed as of May 12, 2015 (the date of our data extract).
The LCD database provides information on loan characteristics such as the size, yield spread, and maturity
of each loan facility. Importantly, it identifies covenant-lite facilities and second lien facilities. Unlike data
available to academic researchers in DealScan, the LCD data allow us to determine what portion of the loan
amount actually represents new money and they contain information on the borrower’s first lien bank loan
rating along with the corporate credit rating. In addition, LCD focuses primarily on loan originations, with
83% of the recorded deals consisting entirely of new money and the remainder consisting of amendments.
By contrast, for a random sample of 114 firms, Roberts (2015) finds that 59% of DealScan observations
are originations and 41% are renegotiations, and DealScan does not distinguish between the two. To
enhance comparability with bonds, for which only original issuance is observable, we limit the leveraged
loan sample to originations.
The speculative grade debt sample includes both bonds and leveraged loans. Because 96% of covenantlite loans are rated and fewer than 2% of covenant-lite loans have an investment grade rating, this sample
focuses on all leveraged loans and bonds that have a speculative grade rating at the time of issuance. Bond

3

We exclude financial firms and utilities from both of our samples.

15

issuance data during the sample period from January 1, 2005 through April 30, 2015 are taken from Mergent
FISD. We exclude private placements, foreign currency bonds, global offerings, convertible, putable, and
exchangeable bonds. We include bonds issued pursuant to Rule 144a. The speculative grade debt sample
contains 7,759 deals, of which 4,413 are bonds.
Following Billett et al. (2016), we classify all leveraged loans that contain a covenant-lite facility as
covenant-lite. 4 The remaining leveraged loans are referred to as covenant-heavy. For bonds, we distinguish
between public bonds that are registered with the SEC and bonds issued pursuant to Rule 144a. Bonds
issued through Rule 144a can be subsequently registered with the SEC. Fenn (2000) documents that in his
sample period, domestic speculative-grade Rule 144a bonds are almost always subsequently registered with
the SEC. Subsequently, Huang and Ramirez (2010) reach a similar conclusion. We use the action type field
in Mergent FISD to distinguish Rule 144a bonds that were subsequently exchanged from those that were
never exchanged.
Several of our analyses require matching LCD loan observations to DealScan. We match loans based
on the identity of the borrower, identity of the lead arranger, approximate origination date, 5 as well as the
size, yield spread, and maturity of the loan tranches. We require substantial overlap in tranche
characteristics, but do not require all characteristics to match since the two databases may record the same
loan differently. For example, DealScan contains tranche type classifications that are not reported as
separate types in LCD, such as bridge loans or delay draw term loans, and whose mapping can be
ambiguous. We are able to match 91% of LCD borrowers and 70% of LCD loan observations to DealScan.

4

While covenant-lite loan facilities are generally structured as term loans B, roughly half of the deals that contain a
covenant-lite facility also contain a revolving line of credit. Billett et al. (2016) examine 53 such revolvers in detail
and conclude that 49% of revolvers accompanied by a covenant-lite facility have no maintenance covenants, 40%
have springing covenants, and only 11% have traditional maintenance covenants. By contrast, in a recent paper, Berlin
et al. (2018) argue that most covenant-lite loan facilities are accompanied by a tranche that does contain maintenance
covenants. One reason for the difference in findings is that, as Berlin et al. (2018) show, firms that borrow using a
covenant-lite term loan often already have a revolver with maintenance covenants in their capital structure. Further,
Berlin et al. (2018) classify springing covenants as heavy, while Billett et al. (2016) classify them as lite. In any event,
as discussed in section 2.4, a borrower that has both covenant-lite and covenant-heavy loans at the same time can be
compared to a borrower that issues both a bond and a traditional bank loan.
5
Origination dates cannot be matched exactly since LCD reports the date on which a loan launches for syndication,
while DealScan reports the date on which the deal closes, with launch dates reported only for a subset of the deals.

16

The most frequent reason for a failure to match is that, for about 20% of LCD loan observations, DealScan
does not record any loan observation for that borrower within 180 days after the LCD launch date.
We match borrowers to Compustat based on name and date, making use of the spedis function in SAS
along with manual verification of similar names in Capital IQ. For loans that match to DealScan, we also
obtain matches to Compustat from the link file provided by Chava and Roberts (2008). Compustat
borrowers are matched to Capital IQ using GVKEY. We perform another name match to link nonCompustat borrowers to Capital IQ since this database includes privately held firms. Of the 2,830 distinct
borrowers in the leveraged loan sample, we are able to find 52% in Compustat and 98% in Capital IQ.
Bankruptcy announcement dates are obtained from Capital IQ.
Two databases are used to gauge the liquidity of the leveraged loans in the secondary trading market.
The CRSP mutual fund database provides information on loan shares held by loan participation mutual
funds on a monthly basis along with mark-to-market prices as of the reporting date. Changes in shares held
from month to month allow us to infer that a given mutual fund traded shares in the loan. We match loans
to the CRSP mutual fund database using the security name indicated in CRSP. These data are consistently
available from June 30, 2010 onwards.
We obtain secondary market loan pricing data from the Thomson Reuters/LSTA Mark-to-market
pricing service. These data are available to us for the period of January 2010 through December 2016. We
calculate bid-ask spreads as the difference between the average bid quote and the average ask quote divided
by the average ask quote multiplied by 100. As a measure of market depth, the data also report on the
number of brokers providing a quote. Figure 1 shows the evolution of total new money raised by speculative
grade borrowers from 2005 through April 2015. To avoid undercounting covenant-heavy loans, which are
more frequently unrated than cov-lite loans, we include unrated leveraged loans when constructing this
graph even though we are not including them in the speculative grade sample. Note that unrated leveraged
loans on average have a spread of 378 basis points above LIBOR (median of 350 basis points), comparable
to the average loan of a B+ rated issuer (mean spread of 387 basis points, median of 375 basis points).
Figure 1 shows that prior to the GFC, covenant-heavy loans were the most important source of debt funding

17

for speculative grade borrowers. There was a brief first wave of covenant-lite loans immediately prior to
the GFC, but issuance of such instruments ceased almost entirely during the GFC. Although bond markets
recovered more quickly from the GFC than the leveraged loan market, after 2010 almost all growth in the
speculative grade debt market is driven by covenant-lite loans. 6 By 2014, the majority of leveraged loans
are cov-lite loans, and total issuance volume of cov-lite loans is as large as total bond issuance. Obviously,
as already discussed, the importance of cov-lite loans depends on the stage of the business cycle, so the
importance of these loans changes with the COVID-19 crisis.

4.

Cov-lite loan issuance versus bond issuance
In this section, we investigate the legal status hypothesis. With this hypothesis, firms are more likely to

raise funds with a cov-lite loan than a public bond if they are private or are likely to become private. To
examine the hypothesis, we use our sample of speculative grade debt issuance, which includes both loans
and bonds with a non-investment grade rating and excludes unrated issuers. Table 1 provides univariate
comparisons of cov-lite loans with public bonds (Panel A) and Rule 144a private placements (Panel B). We
first compare cov-lite loans and issuers to public bonds and issuers. A simple alternative hypothesis to the
legal status hypothesis is that firms use cov-lite loans because the size of their debt issuance is too small to
justify accessing the public bond market. Table 1 shows that there is no support for this alternative
hypothesis as cov-lite loans are considerably larger than bond issuances. The average size of cov-lite loans
in our sample is $839 million compared to $530 million for public bonds. It would make sense for a firm
to use bank lending if the maturity of the debt is short. Though the maturity of cov-lite loans is shorter than
the maturity of public bonds, the average maturity of cov-lite loans is slightly more than six years, so that
maturity is not a reason for issuing a cov-lite loan instead of a bond. Practically all cov-lite loans are senior
secured, while most bonds are senior unsecured. Among speculative grade borrowers, cov-lite loans have
slightly higher ratings, with a median rating of B+ compared to B for bonds.

6

This effect is even more pronounced when excluding unrated leveraged loans.

18

Some of the theories discussed in Section 2 predict that younger firms are more likely to use bank debt.
However, there is no difference in the average or the median firm age between cov-lite issuers and bond
issuers. For a subset of our speculative debt sample, issuers are SEC filers and we can obtain balance sheet
data for them. Compared to bond issuers, cov-lite issuers that file with the SEC have similar firm size, lower
pre-existing leverage, a higher current ratio, and lower asset tangibility in the form of property, plant and
equipment. Average profitability is the same between cov-lite issuers and bond issuers.
Panel B compares cov-lite loans and issuers to Rule 144a bonds and issuers. The biggest difference
between Panel A and Panel B is the size of the issue. The average and median sizes for cov-lite loans are
much larger than for Rule 144a bonds. For average size, the average cov-lite issue is for $839 million in
contrast to the average size of a Rule 144a bond issue of $484 million.
We now turn to a test of two key predictions of the regulatory legal status hypothesis: 1) cov-lite loans
attract unregistered issuers, and 2) they attract issuers that intend to deregister. Table 2 suggests that both
effects are present. In this table, we count issuers as unregistered if they were not previously registered with
the SEC. An issuer is considered registered with the SEC if we are able to obtain data on total assets for the
fiscal year prior to debt issuance. Although Compustat tracks substantially all publicly traded firms, the
database does not adequately track firms registered with the SEC that do not have publicly listed equity.
Therefore, we search for additional asset data in Capital IQ, examining the filing source to make sure that
the asset data we find comes from an SEC filing. We are able to find additional asset data for 668
observations by non-public firms compared to the 1,132 observations that Compustat does track. Thus,
Compustat tracks only about 63% of SEC registered firms with no public equity.
One reason a bond issuer might be registered with the SEC is because of the bond issue itself. Because
the registration statement includes asset data for the previous two years, we would find asset data in
Compustat/Capital IQ for an issuer who was not registered with the SEC prior to the bond issue. To assess
accurately the choices of previously unregistered firms, we treat such privately held first-time bond issuers
as unregistered. We identify them by checking whether asset data are already available three years prior to

19

bond issuance and making sure that SDC does not report any initial public offering for the firm during those
three years. 7
As already discussed, many Rule 144a bond offerings are subsequently registered. These registrations
typically take the form of an exchange of the Rule 144a bond for a registered bond. Hence, Table 2
distinguishes between Rule 144a offerings that were subsequently exchanged and those that were never
exchanged. Table 2 shows that roughly two thirds of Rule 144a bonds are subsequently exchanged during
our sample period.
About 51% of cov-lite issuers are unregistered, compared to 42% of cov-heavy issuers, 43% of Rule
144a bond issuers that never exchange the bond, 19% of Rule 144a bond issuers who subsequently
exchange the bond, and 15% of public bond issuers. In addition, among registered firms, cov-lite borrowers
are much more likely to deregister within three years after debt issuance than other borrowers. About 19%
of cov-lite issuers deregister subsequently, compared to 10% of cov-heavy issuers and only about 3% of
issuers of public bonds and 3% of issuers of Rule 144a bonds that are subsequently exchanged, and 7% of
Rule 144a bond issuers that never exchange the bond. 8
Existing theories of the decision to borrow through bank debt versus through bond issuance are not
well-equipped to address the facts in Table 2. No theory we know of predicts that a cov-lite issuer is more
likely to be a firm that does not currently file with the SEC or will stop filing within three years rather than
a SEC filer. This result is especially surprising since the opposite result holds for cov-heavy loans. A covheavy issuer is more likely to be a filer than a non-filer or a firm that will stop filing within three years.

7

We do not apply this criterion to loan issuances since they do not create registration requirements. We do apply the
same criterion to Rule 144a private placements since domestic issuers frequently register their privately placed bonds
subsequent to issuance (Fenn, 2000; Huang and Ramirez, 2010). Note that, if anything, this approach may cause us to
understate the difference in prior registration status between bond and loan issuers.
8
The reader may wonder whether firms deregister due to distress or mergers. We note that we code bankrupt issuers
as well as issuers that subsequently become a merger target as not having deregistered. Within three years after
issuance, 4% of bond issuers are bankrupt, compared to 2.2% of cov-heavy loan borrowers and 1.9% of cov-lite loan
borrowers. For 176 deregistering loan borrowers we can also observe secondary market loan quotes. We examine the
last known bid-ask midpoint up to three years after loan origination. We find that the loans of 9% of covenant-heavy
borrowers that subsequently deregister are priced as distressed (i.e. less than 90 cents per dollar of principal), compared
to 7% of covenant-lite loans.

20

Although the tabulation in Table 2 is suggestive, it is clear from Table 1 that issue characteristics and
firm characteristics differ across the five types of debt instruments. To account for these differences, we
model the choice between a cov-lite loan, a cov-heavy loan, a public bond, an exchanged Rule 144a bond,
and a Rule 144a bond that is never exchanged using a multinomial logit model that controls for firm age,
deal maturity and size, rating as well as year and industry fixed effects. We use the LCD industry
classification to create industry fixed effects. After filtering out utilities and financial firms, we have firms
belonging to 31 industries. Table 3 reports relative risk ratios for the multinomial logit model with public
bonds acting as the base outcome. The model includes indicator variables for unregistered firms and
registered firms that deregister within three years after debt issuance, so that continuously registered firms
act as the base group. Compared to continuously registered firms, unregistered firms are considerably more
likely to issue cov-lite loans, with a relative risk ratio of 7.75. This estimate implies that the ratio of the
number of cov-lite loans issued to the number of public bonds issued is 7.75 times larger for unregistered
firms than for registered firms. Unregistered firms are generally more likely to issue loans than bonds, as
evidenced by the relative risk ratio of 6.75 for cov-heavy loans. A Wald test of the difference in coefficients
between cov-lite and cov-heavy loans is not significant with a p-value of 0.173. In section 6, we show that
the difference is statistically significant at the 5% level when controlling for additional loan characteristics
that are not available for the bond sample.
Compared to registered firms, previously unregistered firms are also more likely to issue Rule 144a
bonds, with a relative risk ratio of 1.26 for firms that subsequently exchange their bonds and 4.34 for firms
that do not exchange them. The difference between these two coefficients is highly significant with a pvalue of 0.000. Although issuing a Rule 144a bond that is never exchanged could be viewed as an alternative
way to issue debt without maintenance covenants and without SEC registration, a comparison of the relative
risk ratios in Table 3 shows that unregistered firms are significantly more likely to issue a cov-lite loan than
to issue a Rule 144a bond that they do not exchange (p-value of 0.021). This result suggests that a cov-lite
loan affords the unregistered issuer with additional advantages relative to a Rule 144a bond issue. An
obvious advantage is that the Rule 144a bond is a security but the loan is not, so that borrowing in the form

21

of a cov-lite loan does not subject an issuer to securities laws. In addition, however, the issuer of a cov-lite
loan also benefits from bank screening.
The results in Table 3 suggest that cov-lite loans are particularly attractive for registered firms that
deregister subsequently to borrowing. Many of these firms likely know that they may deregister at the time
of issuing the debt. Among such firms, the relative risk ratio for cov-lite issuance is 11.27, significantly
larger than the ratio of 4.35 for cov-heavy loans, 2.20 for never exchanged Rule 144a bonds, and 0.94 for
exchanged Rule 144a bonds (all Wald test p-values are 0.000). This result is consistent with the existence
of a group of firms that want to deregister and avoid being subject to the provisions of securities laws and
the Trust Indenture Act while still issuing an instrument that resembles a bond. The advent of cov-lite loans
allows them to do so. A concern with these results is that the deregistering firms might be mostly firms that
go private through an LBO. In section 6.1, we show that our results are not affected if we use an indicator
variable for firms associated with an LBO.
A few findings for the control variables are worth commenting on. First, loan issuers are younger than
public bond issuers. To the extent that cov-lite loans are commonly accompanied by a monitored bank loan
(Berlin, Nini, and Yu (2020)), this result is consistent with models that predict that younger firms may
choose to issue monitored debt. Second, firms with very poor ratings are unlikely to issue either cov-lite or
cov-heavy loans, but instead issue bonds. This result contrasts with the findings of Denis and Mihov (2004).
The restrictions on banks from issuing loans to excessively risky firms during our sample period may help
explain this result. The relative risk ratio for cov-lite (cov-heavy) issuance among issuers with a rating of
B- is 0.30 (0.07). The relative risk ratios for loan issuance among issuers rated CCC+ or worse are close to
zero, meaning that such loans are very rare. Compared to bonds, cov-lite loans are relatively more likely to
be rated BB-, B+, or B, and cov-heavy loans are relatively more likely to be rated BB-. Rule 144a bonds
that are never exchanged appear to be issued by borrowers that are similar to issuers of public debt except
in their registration status, while Rule 144a bonds that are subsequently exchanged appear to be issued by
borrowers of lower credit quality than public bond issuers, and especially by borrowers with very poor
credit ratings such as CCC+ or worse.

5.

Credit spreads and liquidity differences between cov-lite loans and bonds
The analysis thus far suggests that cov-lite loans are in many ways similar to speculative grade bonds:

they do not have maintenance covenants, they are large, and they have long maturities, albeit about one
year shorter than bonds. However, for cov-lite loans to be useful substitutes for bonds from the investors’
perspective (H2), it is also important to assess whether the secondary market trading is as liquid for covlite loans as it is for bonds. Further, relatively high credit spreads for cov-lites compared to bonds or covheavy loans of similar risk would be evidence that would weaken the substitution hypothesis. Using our
speculative debt sample, we discuss first credit spread differences and second liquidity differences. In the
next section, we examine liquidity differences between cov-lite loans and cov-heavy loans in more detail
using our leveraged loan sample.
Comparing credit spreads across bonds and loans is quite difficult for many reasons. Schwert (2019)
studies the pricing differences between loans and bonds and finds that loans are especially expensive
relative to bonds for safer loans in that credit spreads are similar even though loans are secured. He discusses
many of the reasons why assessing credit spread differences is difficult for firms that have both publicly
registered bonds and loans. The difficulties he encounters are magnified in our sample in such a way that
the exercise he undertakes is impossible to conduct in our study. Our focus is on the importance of
registration status and securities laws for the decision to raise funding through bonds versus loans. The
approach used by Schwert (2019) requires Compustat data and, therefore, cannot be used for unregistered
firms. As a result, our comparison of credit spreads is much more limited in purpose and more caveats apply
than in the Schwert (2019) study. As discussed in Section 2, evidence of high credit spreads on cov-lites
compared to bonds, accounting for observable differences in issuer and issuance characteristics, would be
evidence casting doubt about the substitution hypothesis.
We obtain yield data for bonds from FISD. The difficulty with these data is that FISD has the coupon
rate for 96% of bonds, but has the yield only for 60% of bonds. We therefore show results using the yield
and results using the coupon rate. It turns out that for the bonds where we have both the coupon rate and

23

the yield, the two are close to each other (the means are essentially the same). Bonds for which the yield is
unavailable tend to have worse ratings and higher coupons. The second issue is that the bank loans have
generally floating rate payments, so that they have a spread above LIBOR. In contrast, public debt generally
has a fixed rate payment. To make the two debt instruments comparable, we compute the spread for the
public bond as the bond yield minus the linearly interpolated rate for swapping a fixed rate interest into 3month LIBOR.
The two instruments can differ in the probability of default, in the expected loss given default, in early
repayment likelihood, and in liquidity. As we discuss later, liquidity differences between bonds and covlite loans seem second-order. In general, callable debt will have a higher yield, but leveraged loans can be
prepaid. Since the cov-lite debt would not be subject to the Trust Indenture Act, it is possible that it would
be more easily renegotiated. Easier renegotiation would mean that the debt has a lower probability of default
and lower loss given default than public debt, which again would imply a lower yield. Lastly, the loan is
not subject to securities laws compared to a public bond or a bond issued under Rule 144a. The lack of
these attributes would be expected to increase the credit spread of a loan assuming that investors find these
attributes valuable. Any evidence that credit spreads of cov-lite loans are higher than those of public bonds
or bonds issued under Rule 144a would be evidence that investors value attributes of securities laws more
than they value the fact that cov-lite loans are secured. Such evidence would be inconsistent with the
substitution hypothesis.
In Table 4, we compare the credit spreads of loans and senior bonds. Because we are interested in the
spreads charged by institutional investors, we discard loans that do not have an institutional tranche and
consider only the spread of a loan’s first lien institutional tranche. We find that cov-lite loans have a lower
yield than public bonds or bonds issued under Rule 144a when we control for firm age, deal size, deal
maturity, industry, rating, and year-quarter effects. This evidence suggests that the cov-lite loans are safer
for investors relative to bonds, so that investors value the fact that these loans are secured more than they
value the benefits associated with the bonds because they are issued by SEC registrants and/or because they
are securities. We find evidence that registration is associated with lower credit spreads for bonds and loans.

24

However, when we allow for a different impact of registration on cov-lite loans and cov-heavy loans, we
find that the lack of registration is not associated with a higher credit spread for cov-lite loans. If we restrict
the sample to only firms with registered securities, so that Compustat data is available, we find again that
cov-lite loans have a lower credit spread than bonds.
If a firm, everything else equal, issues a cov-heavy loan instead of a cov-lite loan, the cov-heavy loan
should be safer than the cov-lite loan if the additional monitoring of cov-heavy loans is effective and hence
should have a lower credit spread. However, this effect would be reduced if cov-heavy loans are less liquid
than cov-lite loans as we show later. It would also be reduced to the extent that institutional investors are
ill-equipped to monitor loans (see Berlin, Nini, and Yu, 2020) and to the extent that monitoring might have
excessive coordination costs (see Becker and Ivashina, 2017). We find evidence that the credit spread on
cov-heavy loans is higher than the credit spread on cov-lite loans for issuers for the whole sample. This
difference is driven by unregistered borrowers. There is no difference for registered borrowers.
Interestingly, for registered borrowers, controlling for variables available on Compustat has a similar impact
on cov-heavy and cov-lite loan credit spreads. The evidence on the comparison of credit spreads for covheavy and cov-lite loans is consistent with adverse selection costs associated with bank monitoring and
monitoring limitations for institutional investors. However, we cannot exclude that arrangers have
information about a cov-heavy issuer that makes them unwilling to arrange a cov-lite loan for that issuer.
In this case, the creditworthiness of the cov-heavy issuer would be worse for reasons we cannot observe.
Irrespective of the explanation, the results support the legal status hypothesis.
Panel A of Table 4 distinguishes between Rule 144a bonds that are never exchanged and those that are
subsequently exchanged. A Rule 144a bond that is never exchanged for a public bond shares some similarity
with a cov-lite loan in that it allows the issuer to borrow without maintenance covenants and without SEC
registration. However, it is still subject to securities laws. As stated in section 2, if the credit spread on such
a Rule 144a bond were to be sufficiently low compared to a cov-lite loan, this would weaken support for
the legal status hypothesis. Panel A of Table 4 shows to the contrary that Rule 144a bonds that are never
exchanged have higher credit spreads than public bonds and, hence, than cov-lite loans.

25

Several concerns arise with these regressions. First, since almost all public bonds are callable, we
cannot control for callability. However, some bonds are callable at a fixed price while others have a makewhole provision. If we control for the type of callability, our results do not change. Second, we use the
coupon spread instead of the yield because we are missing the yield for many bonds. If we restrict our
sample to those issues for which we have both yield and coupon, our results are very similar. Third, some
cov-lites are issued as part of a package as discussed earlier and the investors may benefit from this
association (see Berlin, Nini, and Yu (2020)). However, when we add an indicator variable for whether the
cov-lite is a stand-alone cov-lite, we find that the indicator variable has a negative significant coefficient.
Lastly, we add firm fixed-effects. The result that unregistered cov-lite loans have a lower credit spread than
unregistered cov-heavy loans continues to hold, but the economic magnitude of the difference is cut in half.
This result suggests that the adverse selection advantage of cov-lites is potentially smaller when a firm has
borrowed through a bond or a cov-heavy loan as well.
As stated above, a legitimate concern is that the difference in spreads between cov-lite loans and covheavy loans is driven by a selection effect. While this concern is difficult to address, in Table 5 we take a
step towards the logic used by Schwert (2019) of comparing debt instruments by the same firm at the same
point in time. Although we do not observe institutional cov-lite loans and institutional cov-heavy loans
issued simultaneously by the same firm, in Column (1) of Panel A of Table 5, we match each institutional
cov-lite loan with an institutional cov-heavy loan issued by the same firm in the same year. In the rare case
in which more than one potential match is available, we choose the nearest neighbor in terms of deal size
and maturity using the Mahalanobis distance. We find a match for only 22 cov-lite loans, for which the
average treatment effect on the treated (ATET) is a statistically significant negative 84 basis points. To
expand the comparison, in Column (2) we perform an exact match only on the issuer and find the nearest
neighbor in terms of the launch date of the loan, but we restrict the sample to those matched pairs that are
issued within the same or two adjacent calendar years instead of within the same year. Doing so expands
the usable sample to 150 loan pairs, with an ATET of minus 73 basis points. Allowing (in the extreme)
almost two years to pass between loans raises the question of whether the issuers’ creditworthiness still

26

remains the same. To address this concern, in Column (3) we additionally require an exact match on the
firm’s rating across both loans. Sample size is reduced by about 40%, but the ATET remains virtually
identical at minus 76 basis points.
Matching loans within firm is inherently difficult due to infrequent originations. In Panel B, we instead
follow the approach of Ivashina and Sun (2011) and Nadauld and Weisbach (2012) and analyze how the
within-deal difference in the credit spread of the institutional tranche vs. the bank revolving line of credit
varies across deals that have either a cov-lite or cov-heavy institutional tranche. Since both the institutional
tranche and the bank tranche are issued at the same time and have the same priority, the pricing of the bank
tranche can be expected to reflect any omitted variables related to the riskiness of the firm’s cash flows
and/or the value of its collateral. Subtracting the credit spread paid on the bank tranche from the spread
paid on the institutional tranche should thus purge the effect of such omitted firm fundamentals. Table 5
shows that we continue to find that cov-lite loans are cheaper than cov-heavy loans for unregistered firms,
while credit spreads are statistically indistinguishable for registered firms. Compared with the results in
Table 4, the effect is reduced from about 30 basis points to 13 basis points.
The evidence presented so far in this section supports the substitution hypothesis in that there is no
evidence that investors charge a premium to hold cov-lite loans instead of bonds. Moreover, we find
evidence that cov-lite loans trade at spreads that are lower than those at which bonds trade. Though we
cannot value directly the impact on credit spreads of the fact that cov-lite loans are secured, we can get a
sense of the benefit of loan collateral by considering the differences in recovery rates for bank loans and
unsecured bonds. According to Moody’s, loss given default for bank loans (senior unsecured bonds) was
19.6% (52.1%) from 1987-2017. 9 The average cov-lite loan in our sample is rated B+ and has a maturity
of six years. The probability of default for a B+ rated issuer over six years is 20.1% according to Moody’s.
The difference in credit spreads between bonds and bank loans should be at least large enough to
compensate bondholders for the greater loss given default in a perfect markets risk-neutral world.

9

Ultimate recovery rates are taken from Moody’s Investors Service Data Report (Ou et al., 2018).

27

Therefore, assuming that Moody’s estimate of the difference in loss given default is an appropriate measure
of expected loss differences, the collateral justifies a difference in the credit spread of 0.325x0.201/6 = 109
basis points, which is very similar to the difference we find. This back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests
that the value of collateral can explain the difference in spreads between cov-lite loans and bonds and that
investors do not appear to charge a premium on loans to compensate for the fact that they are not securities.
We turn next to a comparison of liquidity between bonds and loans. It is difficult to compare directly
the liquidity of loans versus bonds since there is no database that tracks actual trade prices for loans.
However, the LSTA/Thomson Reuters Mark-to-Market Pricing Service provides market-maker quotes for
the secondary loan market, which we can compare to quoted spreads in the bond pricing literature. We
obtain average quoted spreads for bonds from Chen, Lesmond, and Wei (2007). We use the average bidask spreads they report for noncallable bonds of maturity between one and seven years from 1995 through
2003 (with most quotes available from 2000 onwards). This maturity range matches well with our sample
since 94% of sample loans have a maturity between one and seven years.
We then match our loans to the bond results in Chen, Lesmond, and Wei (2007) based on the rating.
We compute the average bid-ask spread for both cov-lite loans and cov-heavy loans over the first three
months, and the first, second, and third year after the launch date of the loan. A breakdown of spreads based
on years since issuance is not available for bonds. Notice that Chen, Lesmond, and Wei (2007) use up-todate bond ratings while our loan data is limited to at-issue ratings. To improve comparability, loans that are
priced as distressed and likely would have been downgraded during the time period in question are excluded
from the analysis. In Panel A of Table 6, we classify a loan as distressed if it trades below 90 cents per one
dollar of principal. In Panel B, loans are excluded if they trade below 95 cents. Note that these conservative
criteria may cause us to overstate the difference between cov-lite loans and bonds, if anything. For a loan
with five years to maturity, a drop in price to 90 cents represents a change in yield approximately equivalent
to a downgrade from straight BB to B- (priced at LIBOR plus 284 basis points and LIBOR plus 497 basis
points, respectively, on average). A drop in price to 95 cents represents a change in yield about equal to a
downgrade from straight BB to B+ (the latter being priced at LIBOR plus 387 basis points on average).

28

Table 6 shows that quoted spreads are very similar for covenant-lite loans and bonds. For BB rated
debt, bonds have a quoted spread of 54 basis points compared to 58 basis points for cov-lite loans. Covheavy loans trade at a wider spread of 70 basis points. For B rated debt, bonds trade at a spread of 59 basis
points, compared to 63 basis points for cov-lite loans and 77 basis points for cov-heavy loans. Note that
statistical significance tests cannot be performed for bonds vs. loans since we do not have the underlying
data on bonds. However, in section 6, we verify that the difference in liquidity between cov-lite loans and
cov-heavy loans is statistically significant.
Table 6 also suggests that loans become slightly less liquid in the secondary loan market over time.
This effect is more pronounced for B rated loans than BB rated loans. A comparison of Panels A and B
suggests that a significant portion of the increase in average spreads over time is due to some loans
deteriorating in credit quality rather than an actual widening of spreads for a given credit quality. For
example, the median loan has a maturity of six years. If such a loan trades below 95 cents in its third year,
this would represent a significant increase in its yield, which would likely be accompanied by a downgrade.
When we exclude loans trading below 95 cents, spreads for loans with an at-issue rating of BB do not widen
over time and spreads for B rated cov-lite loans widen only by five basis points from the first three months
through year 3.

6.

Cov-lite loans versus cov-heavy loans
We now turn to comparing cov-lite loans with cov-heavy loans in more detail. Such a comparison will

allow us to evaluate the substitution hypothesis, which predicts that cov-lite loans are better substitutes for
bonds than cov-heavy loans. Because a richer set of variables is available for leveraged loans than for bonds,
this allows us to establish that cov-lite loans are substitutes for bonds in ways that cov-heavy loans are not.
In addition, this analysis allows us to assess how the differences in information asymmetries between banks
and investors are related to differences in liquidity between cov-lite loans and cov-heavy loans. We would
expect banks to have more of an information advantage for non-registered firms than for registered firms,

29

as many registered firms are publicly listed firms and as registered firms file regularly with the SEC. Hence,
the difference in liquidity due to the difference in adverse selection should be stronger for loans issued by
non-registered firms.
Our leveraged loan sample includes all US leveraged loans from LCD from January 2005 through April
2015. Unlike the speculative grade debt sample, the leveraged loan sample consists of all loans found in
LCD, including those that do not have a rating. This allows for a more accurate comparison between covlite loans and the full set of cov-heavy loans. In the first part of the section, we consider the decision to
issue a cov-lite loan instead of a cov-heavy loan. In the second part, we compare the liquidity of cov-lite
loans to the liquidity of cov-heavy loans.

6.1. The decision to issue a cov-lite loan instead of a cov-heavy loan
Table 7 shows univariate tests of differences between cov-lite and cov-heavy loans. Cov-lite loans are
$310 million dollars larger, on average, than cov-heavy loans. Although some cov-heavy loans are large so
that mean deal size is around $548 million, the median deal size of $302 million is smaller than the median
deal size reported for bonds in Table 1. The maturity of cov-lite loans is about one year longer than the
maturity of cov-heavy loans. Consistent with the substitution hypothesis, 96% of cov-lite loans are rated,
while only 65% of cov-heavy loans are rated. In further support of the substitution hypothesis, we find that
90% of cov-lite loans trade on the secondary market compared to 44% of cov-heavy loans.
Among traded loans, various indicators suggest that cov-lite loans are significantly more liquid. Timeto-break, which is the time from loan launch to the time the loan starts trading (referred to as the “break
date” in industry parlance) is only 14 days for cov-lite loans compared to 20 days for cov-heavy loans. Covheavy loans are more than twice as likely to break into trading at a price below 99 cents on one dollar of
principal. Because these instruments are floating rate and time-to-break is less than two months for 99% of
sample loans, a low break price cannot be caused by changes in LIBOR and is unlikely to be caused by a

30

change in borrower creditworthiness between loan launch and break date. Thus, a low break price is
consistent with a liquidity discount.
We track secondary market loan trading volumes for loan participation mutual funds using the CRSP
Mutual Funds database. In the average month, loan participation funds trade 1.4% of a cov-lite loan’s
principal compared to 0.9% for cov-heavy loans. We observe at least one trade for 60% of all calendar
months for the average cov-lite loan compared to 41% for cov-heavy loans. Data from the LSTA/Thomson
Reuters Mark-to-Market Pricing Service suggest that cov-lite loans have lower bid-ask spreads and attract
more quotes from brokers.
We note that having more loan participation funds holding shares of a cov-lite loan could reflect that
they prefer loans that are easily tradable, but it could also be that the presence of loan participation funds
in the lending syndicate causes the loan to be structured as cov-lite because such loans have lower
coordination costs (Becker and Ivashina (2017)). To account for this possibility, we collect the number of
loan participation funds that initially report holding shares in the loan when it breaks into secondary market
trading. We use this variable as a proxy for differences that may be due to coordination cost considerations.
The average cov-lite loan has five loan participation funds in the syndicate, compared to two funds for the
average cov-heavy loan.
We also report differences in a variety of other loan and firm characteristics. Cov-lite loans are more
likely to be used in deals sponsored by private equity firms, especially the initial LBO financing, they are
less likely to include bank tranches such as revolvers or term loans A, and are more likely to include a
second lien facility and be structured as asset based loans, which tend to be heavily collateralized typically
by inventory and/or accounts receivable. Cov-lite loans are much less common among small firms, whether
measured by firms’ total assets or by LCD’s middle market indicator. Even for this revised sample that
includes unrated loans, cov-lite loans are more common among unregistered and deregistering firms and
cov-lite issuers are older. Consistent with asset based lending practices, cov-lite loans are issued by firms
with higher current ratios, but these firms also have higher pre-existing leverage and lower property, plant
and equipment than cov-heavy issuers.

31

In Table 8, we investigate the role of SEC registration for the decision to issue a cov-lite loan instead
of a cov-heavy loan. With the legal status hypothesis, firms issue cov-lite loans as substitutes for bonds to
avoid SEC registration. In contrast, cov-heavy loans are not substitutes for bonds, and firms do not issue
them to avoid SEC registration that would occur if they issued bonds. Columns (1) through (3) focus on
firms that are registered with the SEC at the time of loan issuance and assesses whether cov-lite issuers are
more likely to subsequently deregister. The results show that they are. Average marginal effects for covlite loans are positive and statistically significant throughout, with the vast majority of the additional
deregistrations taking place during the first year after loan issuance. The average marginal effect of covlite issuance on being deregistered after three years is a 5.8 percentage point increase in the probability of
being deregistered after three years, compared to a 10.8% baseline probability. Note that these
deregistrations are voluntary deregistrations. Firms that disappear due to bankruptcy or a merger are not
coded as deregistrations. Larger deals with longer maturities are marginally less likely to result in
deregistration, while sponsored deals, and particularly LBOs are more likely to result in deregistration.
Table 8 also includes an interaction between the LBO indicator and the cov-lite indicator to allow for the
possibility that deregistration following cov-lite issuance might be driven by LBOs. We do not find any
evidence in favor of this explanation.
An important result in Table 8 is that bond refinancings are positively associated with deregistration. If
firms were to substitute loans for bonds to benefit from bank monitoring, they would use cov-heavy loans
to refinance bonds. Instead, in column (4) we see that they are more likely to use a cov-lite loan for a bond
refinancing. Refinancing a bond with a cov-lite loan is especially advantageous for a firm that plans to
deregister since the major difference between a cov-lite loan and a bond is that the bond requires SEC
registration and the loan does not, so having an outstanding bond would be an obstacle to deregistering but
an outstanding loan would not be. We see that firms that use a cov-lite loan to refinance a bond are more
likely to deregister immediately.
Column (4) of Table 8 reports average marginal effects from a probit regression of cov-lite issuance on
an unregistered firm indicator, a deregistering firm indicator, and control variables. Due to the lack of cov-

32

lite issuance during the GFC, perfect predictability precludes the use of time fixed effects in a probit
regression. 10 To remedy this issue, we calculate the prevailing percentage of cov-lite loans at the time of
loan issuance, which corresponds to the percentage of loans issued over the past 60 days that are cov-lite
loans. This variable very strongly predicts cov-lite issuance, which is supportive of the Diamond, Hu, and
Rajan (2019) model. At the margin, a 1% increase in the prevailing percentage of cov-lite loans is associated
with a 0.7% increase in the probability that the current loan is cov-lite. We also include the net percentage
of senior loan officers that report a tightening of credit standards in the previous quarterly Fed loan officer
survey, although this variable does not capture any additional information beyond that contained in
prevailing cov-lite issuance. Column (4) of Table 8 shows that both unregistered and deregistering firms
are more likely to take out cov-lite loans than cov-heavy loans. On average, being unregistered increases
the probability of cov-lite issuance by 2.6 percentage points and being a deregistering firm increases the
probability of cov-lite issuance by 5.7 percentage points relative to a baseline probability of 17.7%.
Findings for control variables remain similar to those noted in Table 7, except that the sign on second lien
facilities turns negative, likely because 95% of second lien facilities accompanied by a cov-lite loan are
sponsored by a private equity firm. Consistent with the legal status hypothesis, when firms use a loan to
refinance a bond, this loan is 4.3 percentage points more likely to be cov-lite.

6.2. Comparison of the liquidity of cov-lite loans and of cov-heavy loans
We now discuss the liquidity of cov-lite loans compared to cov-heavy loans. In Table 9, we ask whether
cov-lite loans are more likely to be traded on the secondary loan market. We consider a loan to be traded if
LCD reports a break price. Regardless of whether we consider all firms, only rated firms, or only registered
firms with all financial data available in Compustat or Capital IQ, we find that cov-lite loans are
significantly more likely to be traded. Using all loans, cov-lite loans are associated with a 15.9 percentage
point increase in the probability of trading on the secondary market compared to a baseline probability of

10

This problem does not apply to the multinomial logit in Table 3 since we do observe both bond issuances and covheavy issuances during the GFC.

33

52%. The marginal effects in column (2) suggest that cov-lite loans are as likely to trade for registered firms
as they are for unregistered firms since the sum of the effects for registered plus the interaction of registered
with cov-lite is indistinguishable from zero (Wald test p-value for probit coefficients of 0.256). The negative
effect for registered firms suggests that cov-heavy loans of registered firms are even less likely to trade than
cov-heavy loans of unregistered firms.
Next, we ask whether cov-lite loans break into secondary market trading more quickly. In Table 10, the
dependent variable is time-to-break. As Table 10 shows, the average cov-lite loan breaks into trading one
day earlier. This difference is significant although the economic magnitude is smaller than in the univariate
tests reported in Table 7. In an unreported regression, we find that the reason appears to be the addition of
year fixed effects, without which the difference is five days. Hence, time-to-break has become faster for all
loans, but is especially fast for cov-lite loans. Table 10 reveals an interesting difference between cov-lite
loans of registered issuers and those of unregistered issuers. Compared to cov-heavy loans, time-to-break
is two days faster for cov-lite loans of unregistered issuers, but not faster for cov-lite loans of registered
issuers. This finding appears consistent with theories pointing to a lower adverse selection problem of covlite loans compared to cov-heavy loans (Ayotte and Bolton (2011), Parlour and Plantin (2008)) as any
potential information advantage of the initial lenders may be greater for unregistered issuers.
In Table 11, we examine break prices reported by LCD. The break price represents the first price at
which the loan starts trading in the secondary market. As discussed earlier, break prices can be used as a
measure of liquidity so long as the instrument is floating rate and differences in break prices are not due to
changes in creditworthiness before the loan breaks into trading. Table 11 shows that cov-lite loans break
into trading at a price that is 0.24 cents higher per dollar of principal than cov-heavy loans. To further
alleviate concerns about changes in creditworthiness, in an unreported regression, we exclude the 8% of
loans with time-to-break of more than 30 days. We continue to find a difference of 0.23 cents.
Columns (6) through (10) report marginal effects from probit regressions of whether or not a loan
breaks into trading below a price of 99 cents, which represents the 10th percentile of the break price
distribution. Cov-lite loans are 8.2% less likely to have a low break price than cov-heavy loans. The

34

interactions of the cov-lite loan indicator with the registered indicator again suggest that the liquidity
advantage of cov-lite loans over cov-heavy loans is stronger for unregistered issuers than for registered
issuers, although the difference in break price between the two types of loans for registered issuers is still
significant.
Tables 8 through 10 only assess whether cov-lite loans are more liquid immediately after loan
origination, but do not make it possible to make statements about liquidity over the entire life of the loan.
In Table 12, we use data from the CRSP Mutual Funds database to test whether covenant-lite loans trade
more frequently than covenant-heavy loans. Data availability starts in June 30, 2010 and our download
tracks loan trading until August 31, 2016. Loans originated prior to June 30, 2010 are excluded from this
analysis.
We find that cov-lite loans are indeed traded more frequently. In Panel A, we calculate trading volume
as the monthly absolute change in the holdings of principal each loan participation fund reports for a given
loan. The average monthly percentage of total principal traded among loan participation funds is 0.3%
higher for cov-lite loans than for cov-heavy loans, a large difference compared to the sample mean of 1.1%.
We also find that there are 5% more months in which loan participation funds report at least one trade for
a cov-lite loan than at least one trade for a cov-heavy loan. The average loan has at least one trade in 49%
of all months between the first and last month that CRSP reports at least one fund holding shares in the
loan. As before, the liquidity advantage appears stronger for cov-lite loans of unregistered firms. The
interaction between the cov-lite indicator and the registered firm indicator is negative and significant both
in columns (2) and (7). In a Wald test for column (2), the liquidity advantage of cov-lite loans continues to
be strongly significant even among registered issuers with a p-value of 0.000.
One problem with tracking trades using the absolute change is that we double count trades in which a
loan participation fund acts as buyer and another fund acts as seller. To remedy this issue, Panel B only
looks at purchases of principal as evidenced by an increase in the loan shares held. We continue to find that
cov-lite loans are more liquid, and the difference continues to be larger for unregistered issuers.

35

In our last test, we use quote data from the Thomson Reuters/LSTA Mark-to-market Pricing Service to
examine loan liquidity. Because these data are available to us starting in January 2010, the sample includes
only those loans that were originated between January 2010 and April 2015. Panel A uses quoted bid-ask
spreads as a measure of liquidity and Panel B uses the number of brokers providing quotes. One problem
with measuring secondary market quotes for loans is that distressed loans have dramatically wider bid-ask
spreads than non-distressed loans. There are also fewer brokers willing to provide quotes for such loans.
Therefore, we control for the average bid-ask midpoint during the time period that the regression examines
in each regression in Table 13. In addition, in columns (5) through (8), we exclude distressed loans, defined
as loans with an average bid-ask midpoint below 90 cents per one dollar of principal. Panel A shows that
covenant-lite loans have tighter bid-ask spreads than covenant-heavy loans. During the first three months
of a loan’s life, cov-lite loans of unregistered issuers have a four basis points tighter spread than cov-heavy
loans of such issuers. The sample average spread is 74 basis points. By contrast, for registered issuers the
bid-ask spreads of cov-lite loans and cov-heavy loans do not differ significantly, consistent with market
makers having fewer concerns about adverse selection when SEC filings provide public information about
the firm. Importantly, while the number of loan participation funds in the syndicate is positively associated
with cov-lite issuance (see Table 7), it is not associated with tighter bid-ask spreads immediately after loan
origination. This result suggests that the coordination cost motive of cov-lite issuance and liquidity effects
are distinct from one another.
The longer we follow a loan, the more likely it is that the borrower’s creditworthiness will change, so
that an increasing fraction of loans will be priced as distressed. When including distressed loans, the
liquidity advantage for cov-lite loans disappears after the first year. However, this is due to cov-lite loans
facing a greater likelihood of being priced as distressed at some point during the loan’s life. 11 Once we

11
Cov-heavy loans are more likely to be repriced following adverse developments for the borrower, which means that
they are also more likely to trade close to par after such developments. Due to the lack of financial maintenance
covenants, it is much more difficult for lenders to initiate renegotiation of cov-lite loans when the borrower’s
performance deteriorates. By contrast, a cov-heavy loan can be renegotiated to allow for an increase in the interest
rate. If the interest rate is increased so that it again reflects the borrower’s current creditworthiness, then the price of
the loan should increase such that it again approaches one dollar per dollar of principal.

36

exclude distressed loans, cov-lite loans have consistently lower bid-ask spreads than cov-heavy loans
throughout years 2 and 3 as well.
In Panel B, we analyze the number of quotes as a measure of market depth. Again, cov-lite loans attract
more brokers than cov-heavy loans. Compared to a cov-heavy loan, a cov-lite loan has about a 20%
probability of attracting a quote by one additional broker. The sample median loan has quotes from two
brokers, with an average of 2.5. However, the pattern for the number of quotes does not perfectly match the
pattern for bid-ask spreads. During the first year, unregistered issuers have more quotes for their cov-lite
loans than their cov-heavy loans. However, in years 2 and 3, the difference is driven by registered issuers,
which in general are covered by more brokers. Yet this pattern in market depth does not seem to affect the
actual quotes provided as shown in Panel A.
Overall, the results in this section are consistent with both the legal status and the substitution
hypotheses introduced in Section 2. Unregistered issuers and those about to deregister are more likely to
use cov-lite loans conditional on the credit rating of the issuer. Cov-lite loans are better substitutes for bonds
than cov-heavy loans in that they are much more likely to be rated, much more likely to be traded on the
secondary market, and all of our secondary market liquidity measures indicate that traded cov-lite loans are
more liquid than traded cov-heavy loans. In addition, the fact that much of the liquidity difference is driven
by unregistered issuers about whom information is much harder to obtain is consistent with an adverse
selection explanation for the difference in liquidity between cov-lite loans and cov-heavy loans.

7.

Conclusion
Cov-lite loans share an important characteristic with bonds that other loans do not have in that they

include incurrence covenants, but no maintenance covenants. In this paper, we examine whether firms use
cov-lite loans as substitutes for bonds to avoid costs associated with having SEC registered securities.
Compared to bond issuers as well as cov-heavy loan issuers, cov-lite loan issuers are less likely to be

37

registered with the SEC and, if currently registered, much more likely to subsequently deregister. Firms
that refinance a bond with a loan do so using a cov-lite loan.
Though comparisons of credit spreads are difficult when issuers include private firms, we find that covlite loans have lower credit spreads than bonds and, for private issuers, lower credit spreads than cov-heavy
loans. This evidence on spreads is supportive of our hypotheses. The bond/cov-lite spread comparison is
consistent with the substitution hypothesis. The cov-lite/cov-heavy comparison is supportive of the legal
status hypothesis since, if the comparison went the other way, cov-heavy loans would likely be more
attractive for some firms seeking to avoid registration than cov-lite loans. One way to interpret the
bond/cov-lite comparison is that institutional investors appear to place a higher value on the fact that loans
are secured than on the benefits of securities laws that accrue to bond holders. In fact, indirect evidence
suggests that the spread difference can be wholly explained by the fact that cov-lite loans are secured and
bonds are not. The evidence also suggests that investors do not value highly the control rights associated
with cov-heavy loans, consistent with coordination costs rendering these control rights ineffective and/or
institutional investors benefitting from a debt structure in which a bank still holds another loan that does
have maintenance covenants.
We find that cov-lite loans are similarly tradeable compared to bonds. Like bonds, cov-lite loans are
almost always rated. Quoted bid-ask spreads for cov-lite loans, but not cov-heavy loans, are similar to those
reported in the literature for bonds. Various additional measures of secondary market liquidity suggest that
cov-lite loans are significantly more liquid than cov-heavy bonds. The liquidity advantage of cov-lite loans
is larger for unregistered issuers, consistent with financial covenants creating an adverse selection problem
in secondary market trading.
Taken together, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that legal status is an important factor in
the decision to borrow by entering a cov-lite loan rather than a bond and that it is an important driver for
the growth in cov-lite loans among leveraged borrowers. They are also consistent with the hypothesis that
bonds and cov-lite loans are priced and trade in similar ways, so that they are substitutes for some investors.

Figure 1: Total new money raised by speculative grade borrowers
This figure shows the total amount of new money raised each year by non-financial, non-utility speculative
grade US issuers on the US leveraged loan market and the US public and Rule 144a bond markets. Loan
data are from Capital IQ LCD and bond data are from Mergent FISD. A loan is defined as covenant-lite if
it contains a covenant-lite facility, even if other facilities are present. Because 30% of borrowers on the
leveraged loan market are unrated, issue volume for loans includes unrated issuers. The average loan by an
unrated issuer has a spread of 378 basis points (the median is 350 basis points), comparable to the average
loan of a B+ rated issuer (the mean spread is 387 basis points and the median is 375 basis points). Data for
2015 end on April 30, 2015 and the sample is limited to deals that LCD reported as completed as of May
12, 2015.

Table 1: Univariate differences between borrowers of covenant-lite loans and bond issuers
This table shows summary statistics for covenant-lite loans, public bonds, and Rule 144a bonds, respectively, as well as the results from t-tests for
differences between covenant-lite loans and the two types of bonds. The covenant-lite sample includes covenant-lite loans issued by US issuers on
the US leveraged loan market from January 1, 2005 through April 30, 2015. Loan data are from Capital IQ LCD, and the sample is limited to deals
that LCD reported as completed as of May 12, 2015. A loan is defined as covenant-lite if it contains a covenant-lite facility, even if other facilities
are present. The bond sample includes bonds issued by US corporate issuers from January 1, 2005 through April 30, 2015, taken from Mergent
FISD. The bond sample excludes private placements, foreign currency bonds, global offerings, convertible, putable, and exchangeable bonds.
Because the sample contains almost no covenant-lite loans rated better than BB+, to keep the two samples comparable only debt instruments rated
BB+ or worse from either Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s or Fitch are included. Maturity and all financial ratios have been winsorized at the 1% and
99% levels. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at 1%, 5%, and 10%.

Table 2: Issuer SEC registration status
This table presents issuer SEC registration status for the four types of debt instruments in the sample. Rule
144A bonds are broken out into those never exchanged for another issue and those subsequently exchanged
for another bond, a proxy for the Rule 144a bond being replaced by an SEC registered public bond. An
issuer is considered registered with the SEC if data on total assets at the end of the fiscal year prior to debt
issuance is available in Compustat or in Capital IQ. If assets are available only in Capital IQ, the filing
source reported by Capital IQ must be an SEC filing. In the case of bonds, the issuance of the bond itself
may be the reason for SEC registration. The registration statement generally reports financial information
for the past two years, and several months may pass between filing the registration statement and issuing
the bond. Therefore, newly registered bond issuers with asset data available as of the past fiscal year, but
no asset data available as of three years prior to the past fiscal year and no IPO reported in SDC during
these three years are counted as unregistered prior to bond issuance. Among registered issuers, those that
continue to file financial statements three years after debt issuance are considered to be continuously
registered, while registered issuers that stop filing financial statements within three years after debt issuance
are counted as deregistering. If deregistration is due to a bankruptcy or merger, we do not treat the firm as
deregistered. The sample period ranges from January 1, 2005 through April 30, 2015. Covenant-lite loans
are taken from LCD and bonds are taken from Mergent FISD.

Table 3: Multinomial logit regressions for the choice between different instrument types
depending on SEC registration status
This table presents results from multinomial logit regressions modeling the choice between public bonds,
Rule 144a bonds, Rule 144a bonds that end up being exchanged, Rule 144a bonds that are never exchanged,
covenant-lite loans, and covenant-heavy loans. Public bonds act as the base group. The sample period
ranges from January 1, 2005 through April 30, 2015. A rating worse than CCC+ perfectly predicts that the
issued instrument is not covenant-lite, thus instruments rated CCC+ or worse are aggregated into one
category. Covenant-lite loans are taken from LCD and bonds are taken from Mergent FISD. Ratings are
denoted by indicator variables, with a BB+ rating acting as the base group in the regressions. Industry fixed
effects are based on the LCD industry classification. Standard errors are adjusted for clustering by firm and
time. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at 1%, 5%, and 10%.

Table 4: Differences in spreads across debt instrument types
This table presents results from regressions of spreads on indicators of covenant-lite loans, covenant-heavy loans, and control variables
including firm financials. Junior debt is excluded from this analysis. For loans, this analysis only includes a loan’s first lien institutional
tranche. Debt instruments rated CCC+ or worse are excluded since there are only five cov-lite loans with such a rating. All regressions
include five debt instrument types: cov-lite loans, cov-heavy loans, public bonds, subsequently exchanged Rule 144a bonds, and Rule
144a bonds that were never exchanged. Public bonds to unregistered firms act as the base group. Loan spreads are expressed as spreads
over LIBOR. Columns (1) through (4) define bond spreads as the bond yield minus the linearly interpolated rate for swapping a fixed
rate interest rate into 3-month LIBOR. Columns (5) through (8) augment the usable sample by assuming that all bonds were issued at
par and calculating spreads for such bonds as the coupon rate minus the linearly interpolated rate for swapping a fixed rate interest rate
into 3-month LIBOR. Columns (3), (4), (7), and (8) restrict the sample to registered issuers for whom financial data are available.
Covenant-lite loans are taken from LCD and bonds are taken from Mergent FISD. Standard errors are adjusted for clustering at the firm
and time levels. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at 1%, 5%, and 10%.

Table 5: Differences in spreads cov-lite vs. cov-heavy – within firm and within deal
Panel A of this table reports the average treatment effect on the treated for the spread paid over
LIBOR for a matching of institutional cov-lite loans with institutional cov-heavy loans issued by
the same firm. Column (1) matches each cov-lite loan with a cov-heavy loan issued by the same
firm within the same year, choosing the nearest neighbor in terms of deal size and maturity using
the Mahalanobis distance. Column (2) performs an exact match on the issuer, and chooses the
nearest neighbor in terms of launch date, requiring that the launch dates of the two loans are in the
same or adjacent calendar year. Column (3) performs the same analysis as Column (2), but adds
an exact match on the firm’s rating to ensure that credit quality has not changed. Panel B presents
regressions explaining the difference between the credit spread paid on a loan’s first lien
institutional tranche and its revolving line of credit on an indicator of whether or not the
institutional loan is cov-lite. Only loans that have both an institutional tranche and a revolving line
of credit are included. The sample period is January 2005 through April 2015. The sample is
restricted to loans rated between BB+ and B- since 93% of cov-lite loans have a rating within this
range. Standard errors are adjusted for clustering by firm and time. ***, **, and * indicate
statistical significance at 1%, 5%, and 10%.

Table 6: Comparison of bond and loan liquidity
This table shows average quoted bid-ask spreads (in basis points) for noncallable bonds, covenant-lite loans, and covenant-heavy loans, respectively.
Average quoted spreads for bonds are taken from Chen, Lesmond, and Wei (2007), Table 1, Panel A. These are average bid-ask spreads for bonds
of maturity between one and seven years from 1995 through 2003 (although the authors write that most quotes are available only from 2000 onwards).
By comparison, the maturity of loans in our sample ranges from one year to seven years and four months. Since Chen, Lesmond, and Wei (2007)
compute spreads in basis points vis-à-vis the bid-ask midpoint, we recompute our spreads the same way. For loans, spreads are broken down into
average spreads over the first three months, first year, second year and third year after the launch date of the loan. A breakdown of spreads based on
years since issuance is not available for bonds. Notice that Chen, Lesmond, and Wei (2007) use up-to-date bond ratings while our LCD data is
limited to at-issue ratings. To improve comparability, loans that are priced as distressed – and would have likely been downgraded – during the time
period in question are excluded from the analysis. In Panel A, a loan is judged to be distressed if the minimum of the bid-ask midpoint during the
time period is below 90 cents per one dollar of principal. In Panel B, loans are excluded if the minimum of the bid-ask midpoint is below 95 cents
per one dollar of principal. Note that for a loan with five years to maturity, a drop in price to 90 cents represents a change in yield approximately
equivalent to a downgrade from straight BB to B- (priced at LIBOR plus 284 basis points and LIBOR plus 497 basis points, respectively, on average).
A drop in price to 95 cents represents a change in yield about equal to a downgrade from straight BB to B+ (the latter being priced at LIBOR plus
387 basis points on average).

Table 7: Univariate Tests
This table shows summary statistics for covenant-lite and covenant-heavy loans, respectively, as well as the results from t-tests and Wilcoxon ranksum tests for differences between the two groups. The sample includes loans issued by non-financial, non-utility US issuers on the US leveraged
loan market from January 1, 2005 through April 30, 2015. Loan data are from Capital IQ LCD and the sample is limited to deals that LCD reported
as completed as of May 12, 2015. A loan is defined as covenant-lite if it contains a covenant-lite facility, even if other facilities are present. Maturity
and all financial ratios have been winsorized at the 1% and 99% levels. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at 1%, 5%, and 10%.

Table 8: Covenant-lite loans and SEC registration
This table reports average marginal effects from probit regressions examining the relation between
covenant-lite loans and SEC registration and deregistration for the leveraged loan sample. We proxy for
SEC registration by checking whether the borrower has data on total assets available in either Compustat
or Capital IQ. If the data source is Capital IQ, we check that the data come from an SEC filing and not a
non-SEC report. Columns (1) through (3) assess whether issuers of cov-lite loans are more likely to
deregister subsequent to loan origination. Only firms that have asset data available at the end of the fiscal
year prior to loan origination are included in these regressions. Deregisteredt+1 equals one if asset data are
unavailable at the end of the fiscal year during which the loan is originated and zero if asset data continue
to be available. Firms that disappear due to bankruptcy or a merger are coded as zero. Column (4) includes
all loans and assesses whether unregistered firms and firms that are about to deregister are more likely to
issue covenant-lite loans. In column (4) firms are classified as deregistering if they deregister within three
years after loan origination. The sample period is January 2005 through April 2015. Standard errors are
adjusted for clustering by firm and time. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at 1%, 5%, and 10%.

Table 11: Are break prices different for covenant-lite loans?
Break price is the price at which the loan starts trading in the secondary market, as reported by LCD. Break below 99 indicates that the loan’s break
price is lower than 99 cents on the dollar, which is the 10th percentile of the break price distribution. Columns (1) through (5) report results from
OLS regressions and columns (6) through (10) report average marginal effects from probit regressions. The sample period is January 2005 through
April 2015. Standard errors are adjusted for clustering by firm and time. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at 1%, 5%, and 10%.

Table 12: Do covenant-lite loans trade more frequently?
The dependent variables are the average percentage of a loan’s principal that is traded monthly and the percentage of months in which at least one
loan participation fund trades the loan. Only trades by loan participation funds are tracked. The sample period is June 30, 2010 through April 30,
2015 with loan trading tracked until August 31, 2016. Loans were matched to the CRSP mutual fund database based on the security name indicated
in CRSP. Initial # LP Funds indicates the number of loan participation funds that hold shares in the loan after its first month of trading. If a loan is
tracked by LSTA, but no loan participation fund reports holding the loan in CRSP, Initial # LP Funds is set to zero for that loan. Standard errors are
adjusted for clustering by firm and time. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at 1%, 5%, and 10%.

Table 13: Do secondary market quotes indicate more liquidity for covenant-lite loans?
In Panel A, the dependent variable is the average of the difference between the average bid quote and the average ask quote for a loan divided by
the average ask quote multiplied by 100. In Panel B, the dependent variable is the average number of brokers that supply a quote to the Thomson
Reuters/LSTA Mark-to-Market pricing service. Four time periods are examined: the first three months after the loan’s launch date, the first year, the
second year, and the third year. The sample includes only those loans that were originated between January 2010 and April 2015 and are tracked by
the Thomson Reuters/LSTA Mark-to-Market pricing service. If more than one of a loan’s tranches is traded, we use the bid-ask spread of the largest
tranche. Initial # LP Funds indicates the number of loan participation funds that hold shares in the loan after its first month of trading. If a loan is
tracked by LSTA, but no loan participation fund reports holding the loan in CRSP, Initial # LP Funds is set to zero for that loan. Average bid-ask
midpoint denotes the average of the bid-ask midpoint in cents on the dollar. Revolver, Term Loan A, Term Loan C, Term Loan D or other, and
Second Lien are indicator variables capturing the type of the loan tranche that is tracked in LSTA. Term Loans B act as the base group. Columns (1)
through (4) include all loans, columns (5) through (8) exclude loans whose bid-ask midpoint is below 90 cents on the dollar at some point during
the respective period as well as debtor-in-possession loans. All bid-ask spreads are winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles. Standard errors are
adjusted for clustering by firm and time. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at 1%, 5%, and 10%.
