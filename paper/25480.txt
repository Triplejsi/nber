ABSTRACT
We investigate when and how health shocks reverberate across the life cycle and down to descendants
in a manual labor economy by examining the association of war wounds with the socioeconomic status
and older age mortality of US CivilWar (1861-5) veterans and of their adult children. Younger veterans
who had been severely wounded in the war left the farm sector, becoming laborers. Consistent with
human capital and job matching models, older severely wounded men were unlikely to switch sectors
and their wealth declined by 37-46%. War wounds were correlated with children’s socioeconomic
and mortality outcomes in ways dependent on sex and paternal age group.

Is health just a consumer durable which provides well-being as argued by Arrow et al.
(2014) or is it also an important input into productivity? Researchers and policymakers
have pointed to health as spurring economic growth, both in the past and today (e.g. Fogel 1994; Gallup and Sachs 2001; WHO 2001; Bloom et al. 2004), and a large body of
literature has emphasized the impact of health shocks in utero and in childhood on later
socioeconomic status and health (e.g. Almond 2006; Scholte et al. 2015; Bleakley 2007,
2010; Case et al. 2002; Currie and Hyson 1999), of health shocks at older ages on hours
worked and labor force participation (e.g., Smith 2005; McClellan 1998) and thus wealth,
and of disability on earnings (e.g., Bartel and Taubman 1979; Charles 2003; Mok et al.
2008; Halla and Zweimüller 2013) and a smaller literature has examined the impact of
health shocks at young adult ages on wealth accumulation (Lee 2005). However, estimated wealth returns to early childhood health as measured by height in the past are low
(Bleakley et al. 2014), suggesting a relatively small role for health as a driver of economic
growth in the past (cf. Fogel 1994 and Lee 2005).
This paper examines how the destruction of health capital at prime adult ages affected
socioeconomic status, wealth, and older age health in the past when much of the labor
force was in manual labor. Specifically, we investigate the impact of war wounds on the
postwar socioeconomic status and older age mortality of US Civil War (1861-65) veterans
and we examine how paternal war wounds affected the socioeconomic status and mortality of veterans’ daughters and sons using a new intergenerational database that covers the
complete lifespans of two generations. Our findings have implications not just for understanding the relationship between health and economic growth in the long-run but also for
understanding this relationship in developing countries where longitudinal and intergen1

erational data often are sparse. Our findings also will help us understand the impact of
health on socieconomic status, a relationship which can be hard to disentangle from the
impact of socioecconomic status on health (Smith 2005).
The US Civil War provides a unique opportunity to examine the long-run and intergenerational impact of disability. War wounds are an arguably exogenous health shock which
can lead to immediate and permanent disability. The percentage of men with non-mortal
wounds was more than twice as large as in many previous wars. 1 War injuries also are more
analagous to accident related injuries, a danger in manual labor economies both today and
in the past.2 In addition, because the US Civil War drew combatants from a broad age distribution, we can investigate how age at the end of the war influenced adjustments to health
shocks. If human capital is occupation or industry specific (Manovskii and Kambournov
2009; Neal 1995; Parent 2000), standard human capital and occupational matching models predict that the opportunity cost of switching occupations or industries rises with age.
While there is evidence that earnings and labor force participation depend on the age when
an individual becomes disabled in advanced economies (Charles 2003; Mok et al. 2008;
Halla and Zweimüller 2013), few individuals in advanced economies become disabled at
young ages and the impact of disability on their earnings and labor force participation also
depends on the work disencentives inherent in disability programs. We can estimate the
effects of disability on occupational change in the absence of work disincentives.

In the first decade of the twentieth century, the age adjusted death rate from accidents peaked at 122.3
per 100,000 whereas in the first decade of the twenty-first century the peak age adjusted death rate from accidents was 40.4 per 100,000. See https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data-visualization/mortality-trends/. Accessed

Our findings can also help us understand the intergenerational transmission of health
shocks. Both biological and socioeconomic channels have been implicated. There is evidence from intergenerational and multigenerational data consistent with epigenetic transmission of health in cases of extreme maternal, paternal, and grandparental over- and
under-feeding (e.g. Kaati et al. 2007; Heijmans et al. 2008; Vågerö et al. 2018; Costa et
al. 2018). Economic theory points to a role for the transmission of parental health through
socioeconomic channels. Less healthy parents have fewer resources to invest in their children’s health, education, and financial assets. Children’s health at older ages then could
arise directly from their health at younger ages or from their own socioeconomic status.
Evidence showing that parental socioeconomic status affects child health and that child
health affects child future educational and labor market outcomes has been pointed to as
suggestive of the role that health could play in the intergenerational transmission of economic status (Currie 2009; Johnson and Schoeni 2011). However, empirical research has
been stymied by the absence of data with at least two full generations and a health shock
to the first generation.

1 Data
1.1 Dataset
Our primary sample consists of 6,228 Union Army veterans who were not ex-POWs, who
survived to 1900, who had children and who were drawn from a sample of 39,341 men
in 330 randomly drawn Union Army volunteer infantry companies. The sample of 39,341

3

men consists primarily of volunteers (95%), as did the Union Army, and is representative
of the Northern-born and pre-war immigrant male population of military age (see the Data
Appendix for details). We linked veterans, their children, and children’s mothers to death
records and all available manuscript census schedules to obtain occupational, residential,
and family information under the program project Early Indicators, Intergenerational Processes, and Aging (NIA P01 AG10120, PI: Costa). Although our linkage of veterans’
children oversamples children of ex-POWs, we restrict ourselves in this analysis to nonex-POWs to focus on the impact of wounds alone. Our empirical analyses of veterans
use men linked to the 1870 and the 1880 censuses, yielding samples of 5,076 and 5,731
veterans, respectively.
Linkage rates in our original records to both on-line death records and to manuscript
census schedules are high both for veterans and children. Children’s linkage rates to the
census are highest for 1880 (93%), when most of them were in their fathers’ households
(mean year of birth is 1878), and fall as they start to establish their independent households.
Wound status does not predict whether a veteran could be found in a census; the main
predictor of linkage to an early census for a veteran was whether he enlisted in one of the
large cities. Seventy-four percent of children were linked to death records. In the veterans’
children sample, sons are slightly over-represented with 1.09 sons for every daughter. (See
the Data Appendix for additional details.) Children’s and veterans’ characteristics explain
very little of the variation in the availability of children’s death records and their causes
of death (available for 40% of children with death records). Decisions by individual states
to make their records freely available on-line, including which information to release,
determines whether we can link to death records and cause of death (see the Supporting
4

Information to Costa et al. 2018).
The veterans and their wives in the sample are representative, in terms of cohort mortality, to a random sample of the population drawn from genealogies, but are higher than
those from period life tables of the population which are for disproportionately urban populations. The children’s mortality data are best suited to examining mortality at older ages;
a comparison of cohort life expectancies with those from a genealogical database suggests
that among veterans’ children deaths prior to age 40 or 50 are understated, particularly for
women (see the Supporting Information to Costa et al. 2018).
Our analyses of veterans’ children use 9,811 children who were born after the war and
who were in the 1910 census, married, and either with own occupational information if a
son or husband’s occupational information if a daughter. We impose the last restrictions to
examine occupational status for both daughters and sons. We impose the first restriction
because children born after the war constitute the bulk of our sample. 3 In our original data,
88% of children were linked to the 1910 census (see the Data Appendix). The children
who were married and in the 1910 census were more likely to be the children of nativeborn fathers. When we examine mortality we examine survivorship after age 45 because,
as previously noted, our sample is best suited to examining mortality at older ages. This
yields a sample of 9,130 children. Although our primary analyses of mortality focus on
those married and in the 1910 census, our investigations of mortality revealed similar
patterns regardless of sample restrictions.

Age at first marriage for white men circa 1860 was a bit over age 25 (Fitch and Ruggles 2000).

1.2 Variables
Our primary variable of interest is whether a veteran had been wounded in the war. We
classify wounds into two types: 1) a severe wound, that is, a wound which led to a discharge for disability from the army, amputation, or blindness (all blindness was in one eye
only in our sample) and 2) all other types of wounds. A severe wound is more likely to
lead to a permanent disability.
Our dependent variables of interest for our analyses of veterans are veterans’ occupational class in 1880 (classified as farmer, professional or proprietor, artisan, and laborer),
veteran’s total wealth in 1870 (the last census year this information was asked), and years
lived after 1900. Our control variables for veterans are birth year (or age at the end of the
war), occupational class at enlistment (farmer, professional or proprietor, artisan, and laborer), dummies for enlistment year, a dummy equal to one if the veteran enlisted in a city
of population size 50,000 or more (and thus one of the 16 largest US cities), and father’s
real estate and personal property wealth. We also control for pension recipiency either in
1870 or in 1880.
Our dependent variables of interest for our analyses of children’s outcomes are sons’
occupational class in 1910 (farmer, professional or proprietor, artisan, and laborer), the occupational class of daughters’ husbands in 1910, and years lived after age 45. The control
variables are birth year, veterans’ enlistment characteristics (occupational class, enlistment year dummies, and the city size dummy, as for our analysis of veterans), veterans’
post-war socioeconomic status (total wealth in 1870 and occupational class in 1880), population density in childhood county, the number of siblings, and, in examining mortality,

6

socioeconomic status in 1910.
In the full Union Army sample of 39,341 soldiers, 21% of men suffered a non-mortal
wound during wartime, 5% died from war injuries or wounds, and 25% of men who survived the war had been wounded (see Table 1). (Wartime mortality rates were 14%, largely
from disease.) Non-mortal wounds may have removed men from the field, thus lowering
their risk of death. Nineteen percent of men were discharged for disability, but the cause
is often unknown (9% of all men were discharged for disability without any given reason). Only 3% of all men were known to have been discharged because of war wounds.
Thirty-one percent of veterans who survived to 1900 and whose date is death is known
were wounded during the war. Amputees were a relatively small proportion of the population (less than 3% among survivors to 1900). In the sample we use for our analyses, 35%
of veterans were wounded, 23% had been discharged for disability, and 12% had a severe
wound (see Table 2).
The wounded were more likely to have enlisted earlier, to have enlisted in a large city,
and to be laborers rather than farmers at enlistment (see Table 2). Early enlistees were
at greater risk of a wound because of their longer wartime service. The young and the
less skilled were at greater risk of a wound because they were less likely to have become
corporals or sergeants immediately after enlistment. The same patterns persist for children
of wounded veterans (see Table 3). Although the fathers of wounded men had less real
estate wealth, we did not find a statistically significant correlation between wounds and
paternal real estate wealth once we controlled for occupational class at enlistment. There
were no differences by paternal wounds in birth year or number of siblings for veterans’
children.
7

1.3 Wounds and Sample Selection
There are two potential sample selection concerns. One concern is wartime selection,
particularly by age. If older wounded soldiers were more likely to die in the war than
their younger wounded counterparts then older war survivors may have suffered from less
serious wounds than their younger counterparts. The second concern is that the sample is
restricted to children and their veteran fathers thus raising the issue whether those most
severely wounded were the least likely to be in the sample.
We found no evidence that the war led to selection in the severity of wounds by age.
There was no difference between the wounded and the non-wounded in the relationship
between the probability of dying during the war and age, suggesting that there was no difference in unobserved severity of wounds by age group (details are in the Data Appendix).
Men who had been wounded in the war and who were not married prior to the war were
slightly less likely to have any children and thus to be in the sample and also had fewer
children, potentially leading to underestimates of the impact of war wounds on veteran and
child outcomes; but, as shown in the Data Appendix, the magnitude of the association was
small. Veterans’ probability of having a child was 0.88 and being wounded decreased this
probability by 0.02, a 2% decline. Almost all of those without children were unmarried.
Conditional on having children, men who were wounded had one quarter fewer children
when the average number was 5, an 8% decline. Pension recipiency increased the probability of having any children by 0.03 but did not have a statistically significant impact on
the number of children, conditional on having children.

2 Empirical Strategy
2.1 Health Shocks and Later Socioeconomic Outcomes
A health shock can lead to mismatch, particularly for individuals in physically demanding
sectors such as agriculture. While switching industries or jobs can lead to a better match,
investments in new skills may be required. The older the individual experiencing the health
shock, the less likely he is to switch because the opportunity cost of switching rises with
tenure and because the pay-off period from investing in new skills or learning about the
match quality is shorter.
An individual who changes occupation may pick a low-skill job if the health shock
increases the financial or time cost of investment in a new skill. Because poorer individuals
require less compensation to take an unpleasant or less prestigious job, then, provided that
income effects dominate, as shown by Weiss (1976), an individual whose earnings capacity
has declined uniformly in all jobs is more likely to pick an unpleasant or less prestigious
work activity, such as being a laborer. He also is more likely to choose an occupation with
risky monetary returns.
The age at which an individual experiences a health shock affects earnings and thus
wealth. Because it is costlier for an older individual to switch occupations, he will pay a
relatively greater earnings penalty than his counterpart who experiences the same health
shock at a younger age. However, because older individuals will have had more time
to acquire skills and wealth prior to a health shock than younger individuals, they could
experience lower earnings and wealth declines.
We are agnostic about the exact age range in which men who experience a health shock
9

are likely to switch occupations or to experience a decline in wealth. When we examined
2 year age groups, we found that wound status had no statistically significant effect on
the probability of being a farmer or a laborer among men who were age 29 and age 26,
respectively, after the end of the war. We also found that wealth declined after age 30
among men who had been wounded in the war. We therefore divide the veteran sample
into those less than age 30 and those age 30 or older at the end of the war.
Our data also permit us to examine the correlation between wealth effects and occupational choice by examining both the impact of pension recipiency and of paternal
wealth on occupational outcomes. (We focus on pension recipiency rather than pension
amount because relatively few men were on the pension rolls in 1870 or 1880.) Wealth effects would lead men to choose pleasant or prestigious low-paying work activities (Weiss
1976). Pensions and paternal wealth thus would push men to be farmers or small proprietors. However, as shown in Weiss (1976), pensions and paternal wealth would push
men toward monetarily higher risk occupations, which in this time period would be that of
laborers.4
We examine the relationship between wounds, age and four occupational outcomes
(farmer, professional or proprietor, artisan, or laborer) by, within each age-selected subsample, estimating multinomial logit models where the probability that the response is
4

Risk was estimated as the occupational class specific standard deviation of the residuals from a regression of the logarithm of personal property wealth or total wealth on dummies for state of birth, age, and
occupational group. The sample we used was the 1870 IPUMS (Ruggles et al. 2018) restricted to white men
age 25-59 who were born in a Union State or its territories. Professionals and proprietors had the highest
mean personal property and total wealth followed by farmers whereas laborers had the lowest.

equal to the ith outcome is

Pr(y = i) =

1+

exp(γi SW + δi OW + βi X)
m=2 exp(exp(γm W + δm D + βm X)

4

(1)

if i > 1 and the base outcome is 1 and where SW is a dummy indicator if the veteran had
been severely wounded, OW is dummy indicator if he had another wound, and X is a set of
control variables which includes dummy variables for his occupational class at enlistment,
a dummy variable indicating whether he enlisted in a city of 50,000 or more, his age at
the end of the war, the logarithm of his father’s real estate wealth, the logarithm of his
father’s personal property wealth, and a dummy indicator for whether he was receiving a
pension in 1880. (We cannot interact age group dummies with wound dummies because
of computational issues.) We cluster standard errors at the company level. We present
marginal estimates.
We examine the impact of wounds on 1870 wealth holdings, w, by estimating quantile
regressions within our two age-selected subsamples,

log(w) = γSW + δOW + βX

(2)

where SW is a dummy variable indicating if the veteran was wounded, OW is a dummy
variable indicating if the veteran had another wound, and the control variables are age at
the end of the war, occupational class at enlistment and enlistment year, a dummy variable
indicating if enlistment was in a city of 50,000 or more, the logarithms of paternal real
estate and of father’s personal property wealth. We also run regressions where we control

11

for post-war variables: pension recipiency in 1870, farm occupation in 1870, and the company death rate from injuries. We control for these variables to avoid underestimating the
impact of wounds (in the case of pension recipiency), to understand mechanisms behind
wealth declines (in the case of farm occupations), and to avoid confounding the effects
of being wounded with general stress. We also investigate the impact of severe and all
wounds on median wealth.

2.2 Paternal Health Shocks and Child Outcomes
We investigate how the interaction between paternal wounds and age affected children’s
socioeconomic status and mortality. If a wound reduces earnings capacity, particularly at
older ages, wounded fathers would have fewer resources to invest in their children. Children might receive less schooling, fewer health investments, and lower financial transfers
as adults. Sons might receive less occupational training. Daughters’ circumstances might
be more proscribed and their marriage market limited to men within the same occupational
class or social circle as their fathers.
Our analysis of children’s socioeconomic and mortality outcomes subdivides the sample four ways: by sex and by our two paternal age groups (less than age 30 and age 30 or
older at the end of the war). When we examine mortality we look at children who survived
to age 45 to ensure sample representativeness.
We examine the four occupational classes (farmer, professional/proprietor, artisan, laborer) of veterans’ sons and sons-in-law using a multinomial logit where the probability

12

that the response is equal to the ith outcome is

Pr(y = i) =

1+

exp(γi SW + ωi OW + βi X)
m=2 exp(exp(γm SW + ωm OW + βm X)

4

(3)

if i > 1 and the base outcome is 1 and where SW indicates a paternal severe wound, OW
indicates a paternal “other” wound, and X includes birth year, paternal enlistment characteristics (occupational class, enlistment year, and city size), and, in one of the specifications, paternal post-war characteristics (1880 occupational class and 1870 total wealth).
Standard errors are clustered at the family level.
We estimate the association between paternal wound type and children’s mortality by
running Cox proportional hazard regression models of years lived after age 45,

h(t) = h0 (t) exp(β1 SW + β2 OW + β3 X)

(4)

where h(t) is the hazard, SW is a dummy variable equal to one if the veteran had been
severely wounded, OW is a dummy indicator if the veteran suffered a non-severe wound,
and X is a set of control variables. The specifications include as control variables birth
year, paternal enlistment characteristics, and paternal post-war characteristics from the
1880 census. The standard errors are clustered at the family level. We also present specifications in which we control for sons’ or daughters’ husbands’ occupational class in 1910
by stratifying on these occupations to ensure that the proportionality assumption is satisfied.

13

2.3 Interpreting the Results
A causal interpretation of our regression results would require wounds to be exogenous,
conditional on observable characteristics. While such an assumption is plausible (although
we lack an instrumental variable to test), we acknowledge that the wounded may have had
different unobservable characteristics, including love of risk or conscientiousness, than
the non-wounded. If the wounded were higher risk takers we may overestimate the impact
of war wounds on occupational change. If the wounded were more conscientious, we
may overestimate the impact of wounds on wealth. In addition, a causal interpretation
of our results also requires us to assume that those wounded at older ages do not differ
on unobservable characteristics from those wounded at younger ages. We can overcome
some of these challenges by comparing veterans with a severe wound to those with a nonsevere wound under the assumption that, conditional on being wounded, the severity of
the wound was exogenous.
Either a causal or correlational interpretation of our findings on wounds as a proxy
for disability in the labor force needs to account for confounding factors. Wounds may
proxy for combat stress: the wounded would also have been more likely to have seen
their comrades killed. We found, consistent with Costa and Kahn (2010), that veterans
from companies with above median combat fatalities were shorter-lived than men from
other types of companies. We therefore add a control for above median company combat
fatalities to our regressions. Another possible confounding factor is pension recipiency
and we investigate both the inclusion and exclusion of pension recipiency in our analyses.
Men who received pensions were in worse health and, because the criterion until 1890

14

was a war-related disability, the wounded were the ones most likely to be on the pension
rolls. The correlation between pensions and health may lead to an underestimate of the
negative impact of wounds on outcomes. We therefore show results for controls with
pension recipiency and without when pension inclusion affects the results. 5
Wounds may proxy not just for disability but also for the availability of family resources. The wounded who married after the war married women whose fathers had 17 to
22% less personal property wealth than their non-wounded counterparts (details are in the
Data Appendix). Because we do not have the sample size to control for maternal grandfather’s wealth in our specifications, we may overestimate a pure disability effect of wounds
on occupational change or wealth among younger men.

3 Results: Veterans’ Socioeconomic Outcomes
Men wounded in the war were less likely both to remain and to become farmers by 1880
than the non-wounded (see the transition matrices between enlistment and 1880 occupation in Table 4). Fifty-eight percent of wounded farmers remained farmers compared to
62% of non-wounded farmers. Farmers who switched occupational class were disproportionately professionals, proprietors or laborers in 1880 if wounded. Wounded profession5

We do not have a good instrumental variable for pension recipiency in the 1870s and 1880s: political
variables such as closeness of elections were too weak. In 1900, when law changes provided exogenous
variation, there was no evidence of selection in who received a pension (Costa 1995). The only statistically
significant predictors of receiving a pension between 1870 and 1880, conditional on not having one in
1870, were having been wounded and having been discharged for disability. (The impact of a having been
wounded was twice as large as having been discharged for disability.) Observable characteristics such as
1870 property wealth did not affect recipiency, suggesting no selection on observable characteristics. Our
results are from a probit regression where the dependent variables was receiving a pension on or before 1880
conditional on not having one in 1870.

15

als and proprietors were more likely to remain in their occupational class if wounded (53%
if wounded vs 44% if not), Very few men had no occupation at all, consistent with the absence of work disincentives in pensions. 6 For younger men occupations may have been
aspirational rather than actual and thus the costs of switching might be lower; however,
there should be no differences in aspirational versus actual occupations by wound status.
A severe wound received when young was associated with a decrease of 0.09 in a veteran’s probability of being a farmer and an increase of 0.03 in his probability of being
a professional or proprietor. Although a severe wound was associated with a decreased
probability of 0.04 in being a laborer, the effect was statistically significant only at the
10% level (see Table 5). Other wounds received when young were associated with an
increased probability of 0.03 of a veteran being a laborer but were not associated with a
decreased probability of being in another occupational class. There was not a statistically
significant difference in the association of severe and other wounds on the probability
of being a laborer whereas there was a difference in the probability of being a farmer
(χ2 (1) = 9.61, p = 0.002) or a professional or proprietor (χ2 (1) = 10.14, p = 0.002).
In contrast, among veterans who were age 30 or older at the end of the war, there was no
statistically significant association of wounds with 1880 occupational class and no statistically significant difference in the probability of being in an occupational class by type of
wound severity.
Table 5 also suggests that farming was a desirable occupation. Pension recipiency
was positively and statistically significantly associated with being a farmer in 1880 among
6
We find that neither wounds or pension recipiency were either statistically significant or, in terms of
estimated magnitudes, economically meaningful predictors of having no occupation in 1880.

16

younger men, the group switching occupational categories. There was no statistically
significant assocation among older men. The positive association for younger veterans
between the veteran’s father wealth and the veteran’s probability of being a farmer, professional or proprietor also suggests that farming was a desirable occupation. A standard
deviation increase in the logarithm of paternal personal property wealth was associated
with an increased probability of 0.04 that a veteran was a farmer and a decreased probability of 0.04 that he was a laborer. For older veterans the logarithm of father’s real
estate wealth was statistically significantly associated with a change in an occupational
class (an increase in the probability of being a professional or proprietor) but there were
no associations for younger veterans. However, the magnitude of some of our estimated
correlations of paternal wealth and veterans’ occupational probabilities suggests that we
may be underpowered to find statistical significance.
Older veterans had less wealth in 1870 if they had been wounded (see Table 6). A
severe wound was associated with 37% less wealth at the median among older veterans
and with 46% less wealth when we added controls for pension recipiency in 1870 and farm
occupation in 1870 and thus account for much of the working capital of farmers being tied
up in their wealth. Less severe wounds were not statistically, significantly associated with
wealth among older men but the estimated association was up to -28% and the coefficients
on severe and other wounds were not statistically significantly different from each other.
For younger veterans other wounds were statistically significantly inversely associated
with wealth when we controlled for pre-war characteristics and pension recipiency. The
estimated effect was halved and became statistically insignificant once we controlled for
farm occupation in 1870, suggesting that moves out of the farm sector explained much
17

of the impact of wounds on total wealth holdings for younger men. Adding a control for
the company wartime death rate from injuries did not change the results, suggesting that
wounds are proxying for physical disability rather than combat trauma.
Younger men maintained their wealth despite their wounds, perhaps because of their
occupational transitions. Older men were more likely to see wealth losses if they had
been wounded, perhaps because occupational changes had low future pay-offs. For older
men the impact of wounds was greater than that of a 1% increase in paternal personal
property wealth, which increased an older veteran’s wealth holdings by 32.5% (σ̂ =0.130,
P > |z| = 0.012) when we did not control for farm occupation in 1870 and by 27.1%
(σ̂ =0.086, P > |z| = 0.002) when we controlled for farm occupation in 1870.
Our estimated wealth effects are broadly consistent with the 37% decline in wealth
because of war wounds found by Lee (2005) using a small and different sample of Union
Army veterans. Lee’s (2005) sample did not allow him to examine how the age at which
the health shock was received affected later wealth and occupational status.
We could not find a correlation of wounds, regardless of severity and of inclusion or
exclusion of post-war controls, on veterans’ mortality (results not shown). While severe
wounds may have been disabling and affected productivity (at least immediately after the
war), they may not have affected mortality.

4 Results: Children’s Socioeconomic and Mortality Outcomes
We found that among the children of veterans less than age 30 at the end of the war, the
daughters of severely wounded fathers were less likely to be married to farmers and more
likely to be married to laborers in 1910. The probability that a daughter would be married
to a farmer was 0.084 lower if her father was severely wounded (Table 7). Her probability
of being married to a laborer was 0.072 higher if her father was severely wounded. There
was no statistically significant association between a non-severe wound and husband’s occupational class. The increase in the probabilities of being married to a farmer or a laborer
associated with a severe and a non-severe wound were statistically significantly different
(χ2 (1) = 5.13, p = 0.024 and χ2 (1) = 7.89, p = 0.005, respectively). When we controlled for paternal wealth in 1870 and paternal occupational class in 1880, our estimated
association between a severe paternal wound and the probability that a daughter would
be married to farmer declined by 8%. Our findings suggest that marriages of daughters
to farmers may have been limited by occupation-specific family and neighborhood social
circles. The association between paternal wound and the probability of being married to
a laborer remained unchanged. In contrast, we found no association between sons’ occupational class and paternal wounds received by veterans less than age 30 at the end of the
war.
The occupational class of sons was statistically, significantly asssociated with paternal
war wounds if the veteran was age 30 or older at the end of the war (see Table 8) and the
association was related to the decline in paternal wealth for the wounded among older,
19

wounded veterans. The sons of fathers with severe and other wounds had probabilities of
being farmers that were 0.127 and 0.049 lower, respectively, than those of sons of nonwounded fathers. The probability that the son of a severely wounded man would be a
laborer was 0.118 higher than that of a non-wounded man. Our estimates of the increase
in probabilities of a son being a farmer or laborer if the father had a severe or other wound
were not statistically distinguishable (χ 2 (1) = 1.31, p = 0.253 and χ2 (1) = 0.81, p =
0.367 for the change in the probability of being a farmer and a laborer, respectively). When
we controlled for paternal wealth in 1870 and paternal occupation in 1880, the increase
in the probability of being a farmer for those with a severe wound fell by 26% and the
association was statistically significant only at the 10% level, suggesting that paternal
wealth assisted sons in becoming farmers. Paternal wealth does not appear to have helped
daughters marry farmers.
We also investigated the relationship between paternal wounds and children’s educational outcomes. We did not find a statistically significant association between paternal
war wounds and a child being in the 1880 census and with educational levels reported in
1940.
A severe paternal wound at older ages was associated with mortality above age 45 for
daughters but not for sons (see Table 9). A daughter was 1.311 times more likely to die at
any age above 45 if her father had been severely wounded in the war and was older than age
30 at the end of war, controlling for paternal wealth in 1870 and for paternal occupational
class in 1880. Additionally controlling for the occupational class of the daugher’s husband
increased the hazard rate to 1.322. Adding additional controls for population density in the
1880 county of residence and for paternal farm occupation in 1870 increased the hazard
20

ratio to 1.340 (σ̂ =0.152, P > |z| = 0.010). The hazard ratio was 1.290 (σ̂ =0.142, P
> |z| = 0.021) when we controlled only for pre-enlistment paternal characteristics. Our
sample size is large enough such we are unlikely to be detecting a spurious statistical result;
to find a hazard ratio of 1.32 for a binary variable at the 1% level of significance we need
a sample of 607, assuming power of 0.8 and an unrealistically high correlation with the
other variables of 0.5.7 We also did not find that older fathers’ daughters who were born
prior to paternal enlistment faced a statistically significant mortality risk if their fathers
were wounded; however, a caveat is that our sample contains only 508 such daughters. 8
We suspect older fathers faced productivity declines within occupations which our
wealth measure, taken 5 years after the end of the war, does not capture. We found statistically significant associations of severe wounds with mortality for the daughters of older
veterans who were farmers at enlistment but not for the daughters of non-farmers. For
the daughters of farmers, the hazard ratio on a severe wound was 1.449 (σ̂ =0.227, P
> |z| = 0.021) whereas it was only 1.084 (σ̂ =0.158, P > |z| = 0.579) for the daughters
of non-farmers.
Severe paternal war wounds were associated with excess deaths from cardiovascular
disease for daughters of fathers age 30 or older at the end of the war, consistent with
the association of cardiovascular disease with early life conditions (e.g., Barker and Martyn 1992). A daughter whose father had been severely wounded in the war was 2.383
(σ̂ =0.892, P > |z| = 0.020) times as likely to die at any age after age 45 from a cardio7
The highest correlation was with the father’s enlistment year dummies and it was only -0.06 for those
enlisting in 1864.
8
The hazard ratios on severe and other wounds were 1.090 (σ̂ =0.168, P > |z| = 0.574) and 1.033
(σ̂ =0.120, P > |z| = 0.781), respectively.

21

vascular disease compared to a daughter whose father had not been wounded. However,
the hazard ratio on a severe wound was not statistically significantly different from the
hazard ratio of 1.380 (σ̂ =0.572, P > |z| = 0.438) on a non-severe wound.
Why did paternal severe wounds received at older ages reduce daughters’ but not sons’
lifespans, if the mechanism is early life conditions? Girls may be more sensitive to early
in-utero nutritional shocks as seen in findings from the the Dutch Hunger Winter (Stein
et al. 2007, Lumey et al. 2009, Tobi et al. 2009). Nutritional shocks may have been more
severe among farm households who were growing food both for their own consumption
and for sale. Alternatively, because exposure to infectious disease may have been greater
in households of lower socioeconomic status, girls may have been differentially exposed
because they were not working outdoors or they may be more susceptible to infectious
disease between age 5 and 25 (Goldin and Lleras-Muney 2019). The burden of adult
caregiving does not appear to play a role: we found no evidence that adult daughters were
more likely to live with a father if he had been wounded in the war (results not shown).

5 Comparing Paternal Shocks
Paternal experiences can be transmitted to children either through biological or socioeconomic channels. In previous work (Costa et al. 2018), we found that paternal ex-POW
hardship was transmitted to sons only and argued that the transmission was most consistent with an epigenetic mechanism. We compare our findings for paternal wounds with
those for paternal ex-POW trauma by sex and by different paternal end of war age groups.
We re-run our Cox proportional hazard models hazard models for the paternal end of war
22

age groups less than age 22, ages 22-29, and greater than or equal to age 30, stratifying
on own or spouse’s occupation in 1910. We use the data in Costa et al. (2018) to re-run
our 1910 occupation stratified results for these age groups. All of our regressions examine
mortality after age 45 and are for those married and in the 1910 census.
We found that paternal wounds and POW trauma led to very different tranmission patterns by paternal age at the time of the shock, not just to different sex-specific transmission.
Ex-POW trauma was transmitted to the sons of fathers who were young at the time of the
shock (see Table 10 which examines survival after age 45 by different paternal age groups
for children stratifying on either own or husband’s occupational class). The sons of veterans who suffered severe POW camp hardship were 1.45 times as likely to die at any age
after age 45 compared to the sons of non-POWs, provided the veteran was less than age 22
at the end of the war. The sons of ex-POWs during times of milder POW camp hardship
were 1.20 times as likely to die compared to the sons of non-POWs. The hazard ratios on
severe and milder hardship were statistically, significantly different from each other at the
5% level (χ2 (1) =4.06, P > χ2 (1) =0.044). For sons of fathers who were between age
22-29 at the end of the war the association between severe paternal POW camp hardship
and sons’ mortality was statistically significant only at the 10% level and the hazard ratio was 1.13, statistically indistinguishable from that for less severe POW camp hardship.
There were no statistically significant associations among sons of fathers who were age
30 or older at the time of the war, but statistical power is potentially an issue. In contrast,
paternal wounds were associated only with the mortality of daughters of fathers who were
older at the end of the war.
We previously hypothesized that the correlation between POW camp hardship and
23

sons’ mortality was caused by starvation which induced an epigenetic effect. The relationship between paternal POW camp hardship and older age mortality among sons of fathers
who were less than age 22 at the end of the war is consistent with the positive correlation
between paternal grandfather’s food supply in his late teens and grandsons’ mortality in
the classic studies of Överkalix in northern Sweden (Bygren 2013). In contrast to our prior
results, we suspect that the correlation between severe wounds and daughter’s mortality
among fathers who were age 30 or older at the end of the war was related to productivity
declines among farmers which diffentially affected girls.

6 Conclusion
The twentieth century witnessed a radical transformation in the types of goods and services
produced and in the processes used to produce them. Concurrent with these changes, professional, managerial, clerical, sales, and service workers grew from one-quarter to three
quarters of total employment between 1910 and 2000 (Wyatt and Hecker 2006). This shift
has been implicated as a cause in the long-run decline in musculoskeletal disabilities at
older ages (Costa 2000). Another outcome of this shift, and of jobs becoming less dangerous in the two decades after World War II, is the decline in permanent disability from on
the job accidents (Costa and Kahn 2004).9 We found that men could partially adapt to injuries received when they were young (though at the cost of lower socioeconomic status),
but could not adapt when they received injuries after age 30, consistent with human capital
9

Additional evidence on the extent of accident risk in the past comes from an examination of World War I
draftees age 18-30 which revealed that 21 out of 1000 men suffered from injuries due to accidents, including
losses of extremities, with higher rates in the Southern states (Love and Davenport 1920, pp. 126-8, 143).

24

and job matching models. The cost of an injury for an older man was a 36-46% decline
in wealth 5 years after the end of the war, implying a sizable impact of health shocks at
prime adult ages on productivity. The magnitude of our effect is larger than the 10-15%
wealth decline experienced today by older Americans who have had a severe health shock,
as might be expected in comparing the wealth outcomes of health shocks in brawn versus
brain based economies.10 While health shocks today affect the wealth of older Americans
through changes in their labor force participation, in our sample virtually all men were
in the labor force suggesting that in the past health shocks affected wealth either through
productivity or the amount of time worked. Regardless of the exact pathway, our findings
provide strong evidence of the importance of health on economic outcomes as argued by
Smith (2005). Our finding that a health shock could affect productivity in an age-specific
way but not own mortality also suggests that the literature on health and economic growth
needs to distinguish between types of health shocks and their timing (see Bleakley 2010
for a discussion).
We found that there were intergenerational associations of paternal health shocks with
child socioeconomic and mortality outcomes. We argued that the decline in paternal
wealth affected the ability of sons to become farmers, probably because they had less
access to working capital. We argued that shifts out of the farm sector among younger
veterans reduced their daughters’ probabilities of marrying farmers, perhaps because they
were less likely to meet farmers. Our mortality findings raise several issues for further
research. We found that the daughters of fathers who were older when they were wounded
10
Smith (2005) estimates that a major health shock leads to a cumulative wealth decline of $52,000 over
8 years. This represents a 10-15% wealth decline.

25

faced a greater mortality risk at all ages after age 45 than the daughters of men who were
not wounded, an association which persisted when we cntrolled for paternal wealth 5 years
after the end of the war and which was concentrated among the daughters of farmers. We
found no effects of wounds on the adult socioeconomic status of daughters of older veterans, suggesting that research should focus on the direct health effects of intergenerational
shocks. Our observed outcomes by sex and by the timing of the original shock are in contrast to our results for the intergenerational transmission of ex-POW trauma (Costa et al.
2018) and suggest that more research is needed on the intergenerational transmission of
paternal shocks by sex and by the timing of the original shock.

Data Appendix
6.1 Original Union Army Sample
Veterans are drawn from a sample of 39,341 men in 330 randomly drawn Union Army
volunteer infantry companies, collected by the program project, Early Indicators of Later
Work Levels, Disease, and Death (NIA P01 AG10120, PI: Fogel). The sample was constructed from hand written military service and pension records (including detailed examining surgeons’ exams), preserved in the National Archives, and from selected manuscript
census schedules. The sample is representative of the Northern population of military age
in 1860 in terms of socioeconomic status (Fogel 1993).
The military service and the pension records contain enlistment information, including
occupation and place of enlistment, and also wartime experiences such as illnesses and

26

wounds. The Union Army pension records exist because in 1862 Congress established
a program to provide pensions for soldiers who had incurred permanent bodily injury or
disability while in the service and for the dependents of soldiers who had died from causes
that could be traced directly to injuries received or diseases contracted while in Union
Army service. The pension program effectively became a universal disability and old age
pension program in 1890 and the number of veterans on the rolls doubled.

6.2 Veterans’ Children Sample
We are collecting the records of the children of 8,500 white non-POWs who survived to
1900 and of 1,999 white ex-POWs who survived to 1900. Only the children of veterans
who survived until 1900 were traced because information in the pension records is needed
to link children to death records and manuscript census records, but only in 1900 was
pension coverage close to universal. However, the biases introduced by not examining
veterans who survived the war but died before 1900 appear to be minimal because our
inability to find them in the 1870 and 1880 censuses suggests that most excess deaths
from wartime causes were before 1870. At the time of analysis not all children’s records
had been cleaned and coded so we focus on a subset of the data in our analyses.
Information on veterans’ children was obtained from veterans’ manuscript census schedules which list all members of the household and from family circulars which were part
of the veteran’s pension file (and would have been completed by all of the veterans in
the sample). The family circulars contain children’s names, birth and death dates and often daughters’ married names. All of the veterans’ children were linked to on-line death

27

records and to all of the manuscript census schedules from 1850 to 1940, with the exception of 1890, using familysearch.org, ancestry.com, Find A Grave, and deathindexes.com,
with each record often leading to another record. Records that were found may include
(not necessarily in order) death records (often with parents’ names, exact birth dates, exact
death dates and other family member names), birth records (with exact birth dates and
parents names), marriage records (with spouses’ names and often with parents’ names),
WWI draft registration cards (with exact birth dates and next of kin, often a parent or a
spouse), and Social Security claim or death index (with exact birth dates and frequently
with parents’ names).
Linkage rates are given in Table 11. The availability of on-line death records is the
primary determinant of linkage to death records. Although death sources are available
in some form on-line for all 50 states, each state varies in the types of death information
and dates available. Census linkage rates in the current children’s sample are high for the
following reasons: the pension records often provide names of the veterans’ spouses and
children (including daughters’ married names), various addresses for the veteran, date of
birth and birthplaces for the veterans and their children, birth date and marriage date and
place for the veterans’ spouses, and, at times, death dates for the veterans’ children; 2) the
sample is a Northern sample (the North had better records), and the children are all nativeborn; 3) when daughters’ married names are unavailable in the pension records, these
names can be found in on-line marriage records using their parents’ names and places
of residences. All linkages were done by staff with extensive training in genealogical
research, and all links undergo an extensive series of cross-checks.
Linkage methods are designed to reduce the rate of false positives. By using Ances28

try trees, inputters follow the hints provided, attach relevant documents, and see multiple
match points from a variety of sources that corroborate new information when it is found.
Inputters determine on a case by case basis which information is the strongest to use in
their search parameters, then examine the actual record image and determine the strength
of the match by reviewing all the available information. Inputters can also recognize indexing errors, decipher poor handwriting, sort through mistakes on the record and make
informed decisions.
We have investigated the use of mechanized algorithms for finding birth, death, and
census records, but these yielded too many false positives relative to our manual searches
because, unlike humans, extant matching algorithms do not recognize matching points
from a variety of records nor connect the dots to follow the clues when one record leads
to the next. Mechanized methods are limited to digitized records and cannot open the
document to examine the image in order to recognize errors in indexing and recording;
they cannot alter the search sequence nor change the importance of search fields on a case
by case basis, and are unable to eliminate results that make no sense. Common linkage
methods such as those examined in Bailey et al. (2017) and those used on Family Search
yield numerous false positives. The advantage having human inputters use extensive information to find individuals is that it avoids probabilistic matches, such as those used by
the Census Bureau in their linkage projects, which permit only coarse inference when the
number of entities relative to the number of records is small (Johndrow et al. 2018).

29

6.3 Sample Selection
We investigate entry into the sample by using a probit model in which the dependent
variable is a dummy equal to one if a veteran who was not married before the war had
a child using a probit equation. Conditional on having children, we examine the impact
of wounds on number of children using a poisson model. Marginals for both the probit
and poisson model are in Table 12. We found some evidence of differential effects of
being wounded by broad age group. When we examined veterans who were older than
age 25 at the end of the war and unmarried we found that the impact of being wounded
on having any children was -0.036 (σ̂ =0.015,P > |z| =0.016), a 4% decline compared
to the 2% decline among all age groups. Conditional on having children, we found no
differential age effects of being wounded on the number of children (results not shown).
Our results suggest that the older veterans who were in our sample of men with children
were the relatively healthy because those who were unhealthy dropped out. We thus may
underestimate the impact of wounds on veteran and child socioeconomic and mortality
outcomes.

6.4 Father-In-Law’s Wealth
We run quantile regressions where the dependent variables is the logarithm of father-inlaw’s personal property wealth in 1860 (see Table 13). The impact was statistically significant at the 1% level at the 50th and 75th quantiles, but not at the 25th. Controlling
for wounds, a discharge for disability was not statistically significantly correlated with
father-in-law’s wealth.

30

Figure 1 in the Appendix compares the probability of a wartime death for the wounded
and the non-wounded by two year age group (measured at war’s end) as estimated from
a probit regression with controls for enlistment year dummies, enlistment occupational
class, and a dummy for city size.

Marginals estimated from the multinomial logit model in Equation 1. The sample consists of 4,213 veterans less than
age 30 at the end of the war and 1,398 veterans age 30 or older at the end of the war. Standard errors are clustered
on the company. Additional control variables include the veteran’s age at the end of the war, his occupational class at
enlistment, enlistment year dummies, a dummy indicator for a city of 50,000 or more, and dummies indicating that
wealth information is unknown. Standard errors are clustered at the company level.

Estimated from the median quantile regressions in Equation 2. The additional independent variables are age at the end of
the war, occupational class at enlistment, dummy variables for enlistment year, a dummy variable indicating if enlistment
was in a city of 50,000 or more, the logarithm of paternal real estate wealth, the logarithm of paternal personal property
wealth, and dummy indicators if paternal wealth information was missing. The sample consists of 3,731 veterans less than
age 30 at the end of the war and 1,345 veterans age 30 or older at the end of the war.

Marginals are estimated from the multinomial logit model in Equation 3. The dependent variable is either the occupational
class of the daughters’ husbands or the sons. The samples consists of the 3,665 daughters who were married in the 1910
census and whose husbands had an occupation and 4,366 sons who were married in the 1910 census and had an occupation.
The standard errors are clustered on the family. The regressions control for birth year and paternal enlistment characteristics
(occupational class, enlistment year dummies, and a dummy if the city population size was 50,000 or more). The paternal
post-war ses controls consist of the logarithm of total paternal wealth in 1870, paternal occupational class in 1880, and the
number of siblings.

class of the daughters’ husbands or the sons. The samples consists of the 761 daughters who were married in the 1910
census and whose husbands had an occupation and 1,019 sons who were married in the 1910 census and had an occupation.
The standard errors are clustered on the family. The regressions control for birth year and paternal enlistment characteristics
(occupational class, enlistment year dummies, and a dummy if the city population size was 50,000 or more). The paternal
post-war ses controls consist of the logarithm of total paternal wealth in 1870, paternal occupational class in 1880, and the
number of siblings.

Estimated from the Cox proportional hazard model in Equation 4. The dependent variables is the number of years lived after age 45. Standard
errors are clustered on the family. All specifications control for birth year, paternal enlistment characteristics (occupational class, enlistment
year dummies, a dummmy indicator if city population was 50,000 or more), paternal post-war characteristics (occupational class in 1880, the
logarithm of total wealth in 1870), the number of siblings, and husband’s occupational class in 1910. The samples consists of 3,665 daughters
and 3,809 sons of fathers who were less than age 30 at the end of the war and 761 daughters and 895 sons of fathers who were age 30 or older at
the end of the war. The proportional hazards assumption is tested on the basis of the Schoenfeld residual using a χ 2 (23) test.

The regressions for wounds are estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model in Equation 4. The regressions
for POW hardship are estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model and the data in Costa et al. (2018). Both
regressions examine mortality after age 45. The samples are all children who were married in the 1910 census, for
whom we have own or spouse’s occupation, and who survived to age 45.

Confidence intervals indicated by the vertical lines. Estimated from the Union Army sample of 39,341 men
using a probit regression in which the dependent variables is a dummy equal to 1 if the soldier died in the war
and the independent variables are dummy variable indicating if the soldier was wounded, dummy variables
for 2 year age groups (except for the first and last age groups), the interaction between the wounded dummy
and the age dummies, and controls for enlistment characteristics (occupational class and city size).

Both children known to be alive and children with missing death dates are included in ”Not Known to be Dead.”
Children ”Not Known to be Dead” were searched for in all censuses. The higher linkage rates for those known to be
alive suggest that many children with missing death dates were probably dead.

Marriages known to have occurred during or prior to the war are excluded, yielding 6,172 observations for everyone
and 5,138 observatons where veterans had children. The probability of having a child was 0.883. Those with children
had a mean number of 5 children. Additional control variables were age at the end of the war, indicator variables
for father’s US birth and Irish birth, occupational class at enlistment, enlistment year dummies, and a dummy for
enlistment in a city of over 50,000. Standard errors are clustered at the company level.
