Monetary Policy Communications and their Effects on Household Inflation Expectations

January 2019, Revised September 2019
JEL No. C83,D84,E31
ABSTRACT
We study how different forms of communication influence the inflation expectations of
individuals in a randomized controlled trial. We first solicit individuals’ inflation expectations in
the Nielsen Homescan panel and then provide eight different forms of information regarding
inflation. Reading the actual Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement has about the
same average effect on expectations as simply being told about the Federal Reserve’s inflation
target. Reading a news article about the most recent FOMC meetings results in a forecast revision
which is smaller by half. Our results have implications for how central banks should
communicate to the broader public.

Introduction

Central bank communications have changed a lot in the last thirty years, as illustrated by the
statements above from different chairmen of the Federal Reserve. Central bankers now announce their
policy decisions, explain their reasoning and describe their plans for the future. These new
communications strategies have been targeted primarily at financial markets, both to minimize
financial volatility as well as to shape longer-term interest rates to better achieve central banks’
objectives. In this respect, they seem to have been successful, as illustrated e.g. by the effects of
forward-guidance announcements on long-term interest rates (Swanson 2018).
In terms of influencing the expectations of households or firms, central banks have had the
much more targeted goal of “anchoring” their inflation expectations. 2 Yet despite this modest
objective, central banks appear to have systematically failed in achieving it across most advanced
economies. Firms and households in low-inflation countries report beliefs about inflation that are far
from anchored, seem unaware of even dramatic monetary policy announcements, and more generally
display almost no knowledge of what central banks do (see e.g. Coibion et al. 2018a, D’Acunto et al.
2018a, and Binder 2017). This ignorance may be a sign of central banks’ success (since firms and
households have little incentive to worry about inflation or monetary policy), but it is unlikely to be
innocuous: some of the non-traditional policies at the zero lower bound (ZLB) are thought to operate
primarily through the inflation expectations of households and firms. If their expectations are
unresponsive to central bank announcements and communications, as they seem to be (Coibion et al.
2018a, D’Acunto et al. 2018b), then this class of policies cannot be effective. Understanding how

Janet Yellen stated the communications objective as “Put differently, the purpose of providing greater clarity about the
FOMC's longer-run inflation goal is to anchor inflation expectations more firmly. These more firmly anchored expectations
in turn free the Committee's hand to more actively and effectively stabilize short-run fluctuations in economic activity.”

central banks can better communicate with the general public to shape their expectations is therefore
of first-order importance for the implementation of policies at the ZLB. 3
To better understand how central banks could communicate with the general public, we
combine a new large-scale survey of households with a range of randomized information treatments
to study how different types of communications affect the inflation expectations of consumers. While
randomized control trials (RCTs) have recently begun to be applied in macroeconomics (e.g. Armona,
Fuster and Zafar 2018, Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Kumar 2018, Binder and Rodrigue 2019), our
approach is unique in the magnitude of the survey. Approximately 20,000 consumers responded to
our survey, more than ten times the size of the New York Federal Reserve of Bank’s Survey of
Consumer Expectations or the size of other household surveys used for RCTs. This unprecedented
scale allows us to consider simultaneously a wide range of different information treatments (eight
different treatments and a control group) as well as to explore how different characteristics of
respondents might affect their response to the treatment, both immediately as well as in subsequent
months in which we deploy follow-up surveys. The subsequent surveys take place three and six
months later, so we can measure the persistence of the information effect much more systematically
than previous work relying on rapid follow-ups. It also allows for a much more precise identification
of the size of these effects than possible otherwise, and through this precision we are able to identify
some unexpected differences across treatments.
Our approach yields a novel set of facts about which types of information are most effective
at influencing the beliefs of households, both immediately as well as over longer periods. We find
that providing households with simple statistics about inflation, such as the most recent rate of
inflation, the Fed’s inflation target or the FOMC’s inflation forecast, has statistically and
economically significant effects on inflation expectations: this type of information reduces
households’ average forecast of inflation by 1.0-1.2 percentage points. The implied change in the
perceived real interest rate from this adjustment of inflation expectations dwarfs the estimated effects
of quantitative easing or forward guidance on nominal (as well as real) interest rates (see Bhattarai
and Neely 2018 for a survey of these estimates). Evidence suggests that individuals adjust their
consumption plans to changes in inflation expectations as predicted by the consumer Euler equation
(D’Acunto et al. 2016 and Crump et al. 2015), so the large effects on perceived real interest rates

3

Improved central bank communication with the public would also serve to enhance the credibility of those institutions.
Since households and firms in low-inflation countries are largely unaware of the central bank’s policy objectives or of recent
inflation rates, informing them of both could only improve the credibility of these institutions in the eyes of the public.

imply that the management of inflation expectations could be a very powerful policy tool if central
banks were better able to reach consumers with their communication. The fact that pre-treatment
inflation expectations are dispersed and substantially differ from the Fed’s inflation target of 2% also
implies that the current focus of central bank communication on financial market participants and
professional forecasters limits its power to affect real decisions of households and firms, and
ultimately the overall economy. Several central banks have realized the limited power of conventional
monetary policy communication tools and have started to explore more unconventional
communication such as music videos on inflation targeting by the Central Bank of Jamaica or the
extensive use of Twitter to discuss and explain monetary policy decisions as exemplified by Olli
Rehn, the Governor of the Bank of Finland.
The effect on households’ inflation expectations from these simple pieces of information is
also mildly persistent: when interviewed in follow-up interviews three months after the information
treatment, households’ inflation expectations had only converged half-way back to their original
average levels but fully converge within six months. These results suggests central banks cannot rely
on one-off messages but have to develop a repeated communication strategy to the extent central
banks intend to manage consumer expectations through communication.
While these information treatments seem to have large effects on expectations, we find that not
all information is processed in the same way. For example, a random subset of households was instead
provided with the entire post-meeting statement of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).
Despite its length and detail, the effect of this treatment was no larger than simply providing households
with the FOMC inflation forecast, reducing the average inflation expectation by about 1.2 percentage
points. Another subset of households was given a news article from the USA Today covering the same
FOMC meeting. Strikingly, this easy-to-read summary of the Fed’s decision and motivation had a much
smaller effect on inflation expectations: about half of the other treatments. Despite being written
explicitly for the general public, this media transmission of the FOMC’s decision and motivation seems
to have either dissipated the message or, more likely given that the article is much clearer than the FOMC
statement, been discounted by households because of its origin. Indeed, survey respondents indicate that
newspapers are generally viewed as less credible than friends and co-workers, direct communication
from the government, or even social media. This suggests one reason why monetary policy-makers have
had so little success affecting the inflation expectations of households: relying on the conventional media
to diffuse their message to the public can be ineffective because many households no longer read
newspapers and even if they do, individuals discount reports from the news media.
3

Exploiting the micro-level heterogeneity underlying these results sheds additional insight.
First, there is in general little variation in terms of how different types of consumers respond to most
signals: conditional on their initial beliefs (which do differ across groups), the way they respond to a
common signal is broadly similar. This pattern in updating yields declines in disagreement across
agents after each treatment. Consistent with this homogeneity in how people respond to a common
signal, we find that the average responses of beliefs to each treatment are not driven by large changes
in the beliefs of a subgroup within the treatment, i.e. little extensive margin adjustment exists in the
response to treatments across subgroups and almost all of the variation is coming from the intensive
margin. The one exception to these otherwise fairly systematic responses to information treatments
lies in the USA Today treatment: we find that low-income low-education individuals
disproportionately downweigh the article from this news source, although all groups tend to discount
the news report from USA Today. One explanation might have to do with political perspective, but
the USA Today is a non-partisan newspaper and we find similar responses across political
orientations. Our results point toward the need for more research toward understanding how
consumers interpret news from the media, such as whether all newspapers would be treated alike (e.g.
Wall Street Journal vs. USA Today vs. New York Times), the role that the media plays in
communicating news about the economy and policy to households, and which individuals acquire
news via traditional media outlets. Moreover, more researcher is needed to understand which medium
is most effective for policy communication and whether the sender of the message affects the response
of the broader population.
This paper builds on a growing literature focusing on how economic agents form their
expectations and process information (see Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Kamdar (2018) for a survey, and
Bordalo et al. 2018 for a recent example). It is most closely related to recent work using randomized
information treatments to characterize how agents learn and respond to new information.4 Randomized
information treatments applied to firms in New Zealand, for example, suggest that managers respond
strongly to information about recent inflation or the inflation target (Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Kumar
2018) as well as to the higher-order beliefs of other managers (Coibion et al. 2018b). Coibion,
Gorodnichenko and Ropele (2018) document similarly large responses of firm expectations in Italy to
information about recent inflation or the inflation target, as do Humziker et al. (2018) for firms in

4

This approach builds on an earlier (and ongoing) literature in development using RCTs described in Banerjee, Duflo
and Kremer (2016). See Cavallo et al. (2017) for an application of RCTs to inflation expectations households in the U.S.
and Argentina and Fuster et al. (2019) for an RCT studying the spending response to unanticipated spending shocks.

Switzerland. Additional results have also been documented for households: Roth and Wohlfart (2018)
consider how households respond to professionals’ opinions about the likelihood of a recession while
Armona et al. (2018) assess how households respond to news about housing prices. In related work,
Haldane and McMahon (2018) use randomized treatments to explore how/whether changing the
presentation of the Bank of England’s statements alters the public’s understanding of their message.
Finally, Binder and Rodrigue (2018) document that households revise their long-run inflation forecasts
when presented with information about recent inflation or the central bank’s inflation target.
Relative to this prior work, we make a number of contributions. First, the scale of our
randomized information treatment is simply unprecedented in this literature, which among other
things allows for much more precise identification of estimated effects. Second, we are able to
consider a much wider range of information treatments simultaneously than in prior work, including
not just the provision of simple facts about inflation but also more original treatments like the FOMC
statement or a newspaper description of FOMC decisions. This is important because ex ante it is
unclear whether households react more in their inflation expectations to information about past
inflation, inflation forecasts, or detailed discussions also about the state of the economy. Third, we
have a more systematic follow-up of individuals than in prior work on household expectations that
allows us to rule out experimenter demand effects. Fourth, we provide a placebo treatment to
disentangle genuine learning from anchoring affects and spurious learning. Finally, our larger crosssection allows us to examine micro-heterogeneity in expectations and updating in exceptional detail.
Our work also speaks to a broader literature on central bank communication. While much of this
work focuses on financial markets, as does central bank communication (see e.g. Blinder et al. 2008),
there has been growing concern about the ability of central banks to communicate with the broader public.
Blinder (2009), for example, was an early voice advocating for more focus on communicating with an
audience beyond experts and financial markets. Recent work has documented the shortcomings of current
communications strategies. Carvalho and Nechio (2014) find that few households in the U.S. form
macroeconomic expectations that are consistent with how the Federal Reserve makes policy, a finding
largely confirmed in Drager et al. (2016). Binder (2017) shows that most households do not know the
names or objectives of U.S. monetary policy-makers. Not only do we provide more (and larger-scale)
evidence on U.S. households’ lack of knowledge about monetary policy, we also document a novel
possible source of this: a dismissal of news reports about monetary policy.

Data and Survey Design

This section describes the survey design we use to elicit inflation expectations, the various treatments, and
provides descriptive statistics of individual inflation expectations. We first detail the Nielsen Homescan
panel on which we run the survey and then provide more information on the structure of the survey.
2.1 Nielsen Panel
In June, September, and December of 2018, we fielded three waves of the Chicago Booth Expectations
and Communications Survey inviting participation by all household members in the Kilts-Nielsen
Consumer Panel (KNCP). The KNCP represents a panel of approximately 80,000 households that
report to AC Nielsen (i) their static demographic characteristics, such as household size, income, ZIP
code of residence, and marital status, and (ii) the dynamic characteristics of their purchases, that is,
which products they purchase, at which outlets, and at which prices. Panelists update their demographic
information at an annual frequency to reflect changes in household composition or marital status.
Nielsen attempts to balance the panel on nine dimensions: household size, income, age of
household head, education of female household head, education of male household head, presence of
children, race/ethnicity, and occupation of the household head. Panelists are recruited online, but the
panel is balanced using Nielsen’s traditional mailing methodology. Nielsen checks the sample
characteristics on a weekly basis and performs adjustments when necessary.
Nielsen provides households with various incentives to guarantee the accuracy and
completeness of the information households report. They organize monthly prize drawings, provide
points for each instance of data submission, and engage in ongoing communication with households.
Panelists can use points to purchase gifts from a Nielsen-specific award catalog. Nielsen structures the
incentives to not bias the shopping behavior of their panelists. The KNCP has a retention rate of more
than 80% at the annual frequency. Nielsen validates the reported consumer spending with the scanner
data of retailers on a quarterly frequency to ensure high data quality. The KNCP filters households that
do not report a minimum amount of spending over the previous 12 months.
2.2 Chicago Booth Expectations and Communication Survey
Nielsen runs surveys on a monthly frequency on a subset of panelists in the KNCP, the online panel,
but also offers customized solutions for longer surveys. Retailers and fast-moving consumer-good
producers purchase this information and other services from Nielsen for product design and targetgroup marketing.
6

In spring 2018, we designed a customized survey consisting of 37 questions in total in
cooperation with Nielsen, the Chicago Booth Expectations and Communication Survey. The survey also
contains eight different information treatments as well as one control group. To reduce the burden of
participating in the survey, some questions were asked only of a subset of respondents. We report the
full survey of the first wave in the online appendix. Our survey design builds on the Michigan Survey
of Consumers, the New York Fed Survey of Consumer Expectations, the Panel on Household Finances
at the Deutsche Bundesbank as well as D’Acunto et al. (2018).
Nielsen fielded the first wave of the survey in May-June of 2018. The survey sample was 83,061
households. 24,510 individuals responded for a response rate of 26.50% and an average response time
of 15 minutes. The second and third waves were shorter, consisting mostly of follow-up questions, with
median response times of about 10 minutes and 32,658 unique respondents for the second wave and 13
minutes and 29,348 unique respondents for the third wave. Nielsen provides weights to ensure
representativeness of the households participating in the survey.
The initial wave of the survey covers a wide range of questions. First, respondents are presented
with a series of questions about their demographic characteristics, which are more detailed relative to
the basic demographic information the KNCP provides. We collect information on employment status,
current occupation, financial constraints, savings and portfolio choice, gas prices and expectations, past
spending behavior in various categories including expenses that are not covered in the KNCP, and we
identify the primary shopper of the household among all the responding members. Participants are then
asked a sequence of questions about their perceptions and expectations of inflation. We follow the
design in the recent New York Fed Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE) and ask specifically about
inflation, because asking about prices might induce individuals to think about specific items whose
prices they recall rather than about overall inflation (see Crump et al. (2015) for a recent paper using
the SCE data). We first ask individuals about their perception of past inflation, that is, inflation over the
previous 12 months. We then ask them about their expectations for 12-month-ahead inflation. We elicit
a full probability distribution of expectations by asking participants to assign probabilities to different
possible levels of the inflation rate. In addition, we also ask about the perception of the current
unemployment rate and the expected unemployment rate in twelve months.
Subsequent waves largely follow the same structure but in a much shorter form. Demographic
characteristics are assumed to be time invariant. Hence, the follow-up surveys are primarily used to
measure individuals’ perceptions and expectations of inflation over time.

7

2.3 Treatments
After respondents answered the initial set of questions in the first wave, they were assigned to one of
nine groups: a control group and eight treatment groups. We designed the treatments to disentangle the
effects of different possible types of monetary policy communication, especially ones that provide some
simple statistics that might help individuals update their inflation expectations. In addition, we also
provided a placebo treatment to differentiate true learning from spurious learning possibly due to
anchoring effects. Each group consists of 1/9th of the total sample that received the survey and the
treatments are randomly assigned. Appendix Table 6 confirms that the different treatment groups are
comparable along all major observable characteristics.
Specifically, the treatments are (i) the actual CPI inflation rate over the last twelve month
(2.3%); (ii) the inflation target of the Federal Reserve of 2% per year; (iii) the FOMC forecast for
inflation in 2018 of 1.9% (we informed participants that the FOMC is responsible for setting short
term interest rates); (iv) the most recent FOMC statement; (v) the coverage of the most recent FOMC
decision in USA Today. We were also interested to see whether participants might have a Philips
curve in mind and provided the most recent unemployment numbers as treatment (vi); D’Acunto et
al. (2018) document individuals extrapolate from salient price changes to overall inflation and, hence,
we informed one of the treatment groups that the national average gas price inflation over the previous
three months of 6.4% as treatment (vii), and as placebo treatment we provided the actual fact that the
U.S. population grew by 2% over the last two years. We report the treatments as part of the overall
survey in the Online Appendix. Ex-ante it is not clear whether individuals might react more to
information about current inflation, the inflation target, or inflation forecasts. Some households might
extrapolate from current inflation to future inflation and providing them with accurate information
about current inflation might be most effective in shaping expectations. Other individuals instead
might have fully forward-looking information and providing these households with information on
the forecasts of professionals or the official information target might be more relevant for shaping
expectations. Finally, some individuals might form expectations about inflation jointly with
expectations about other economic variables such as the unemployment rate and providing these
households information about these variables could result in the largest revision in inflation
expectations (Andre et al. 2019). No research exists that has systematically compared the
effectiveness of different information treatments for households and different central banks follow
different communication strategies to the extent they have any systematic communication with the
ordinary people.
8

Following each treatment (as well as for the control group), respondents were again asked about
their inflation forecasts and perceptions, but this time in the form of a point estimate to avoid them
having to answer the exact same question twice. This allows us to measure the instantaneous revision
in expectations (if any) after the information treatments compared to the control group. The treatments
were only applied in the first wave of the survey. In subsequent waves, respondents were again asked
for their inflation expectations and perceptions, but questionnaires were identical across all respondents
in the two follow-up waves. The first follow-up was after three months and the second after six months.
2.4 Preliminary Facts and External Validity
We present in Table 1 average 12-month ahead inflation expectations and perceptions of all individuals
in the survey prior to any information treatment being applied, as well as these same facts along a
number of observable characteristics of the individuals. The average inflation expectation across all
households is 2.5% with a standard deviation of 2.6%.5 For comparison, the average 12-month ahead
inflation expectation in the Michigan Survey of Consumers in May 2018 was 3.3% (with a standard
deviation of 2.9%). Hence, our results are broadly in line with other surveys of households taking place
at the same time, both in terms of the first and second moments of the inflation expectation distribution.
We find that the perceived inflation rate of households in our sample was 2.5%, at a time when
the annual CPI inflation rate was 2.3% (May 2018). While the average perceived inflation was therefore
quite close to the actual inflation rate, this masks profound levels of disagreement across households
about recent inflation: the cross-sectional standard deviation of perceived inflation was 2.7%, about the
same amount of disagreement as for inflation forecasts. This points toward significant levels of
inattention on the part of many individuals toward aggregate inflation. As documented in Jonung (1981)
for Swedish households, there is a high correlation between households’ perceptions of recent inflation
and their expectations of future inflation at 0.79. D’Acunto et al. (2018) document in a preceding survey
of U.S. households that individuals’ perceptions of recent inflation are disproportionately shaped by the
recent price movements of goods they purchase frequently. The associated inattention to recent
aggregate inflation suggests that information treatments focusing on actual values of recent inflation
might lead to significant revisions in households’ expectations of future inflation.

5

Here and in what follows we use a Huber estimator to compute moments and estimate regression coefficients. This
approach allows us to remove outliers and influential observations automatically. Descriptive statistics for unfiltered data
are reported in Appendix Table 4. We apply sampling weights everywhere.

9

The inattention of households extends beyond inflation to monetary policy more generally. For
example, respondents were also asked what inflation rate the Federal Reserve was trying to achieve in
the long-run. The results of this question are displayed in Figure 1. Less than twenty percent of
respondents correctly answered 2%. Barely 50% answered a number ranging from 0% to 5%.
Strikingly, almost forty percent answered that the Federal Reserve was targeting an inflation rate of
10% or more, which suggests a pervasive lack of knowledge on the part of households about the
objectives of the Federal Reserve. This is consistent with previous evidence on the knowledge of
households and firms in low-inflation environments about monetary policy (Binder 2017, Kumar et al.
2015, Cavallo et al. 2017).
Other features of the survey are also consistent with previously documented evidence. For
example, we find that men have lower and less dispersed inflation expectations than women on average
(as in Bryan and Venkatu 2001 and D’Acunto et al. 2019), higher-income households also have lower
and less dispersed inflation expectations (as in Binder 2015) as do households with higher stocks of
savings and higher savings rates, where the latter is consistent with D’Acunto et al. (2018). Taken
together, these results suggest that our survey replicates the main cross-sectional stylized facts of
households’ inflation expectations and therefore supports the validity of our survey as a measure of
individuals’ beliefs about inflation.

Treatment Effects of Different Communication Tools

In this section, we present and discuss how different treatments affect the inflation expectations of
individuals
3.1 Average Effects on Beliefs
To characterize how information treatments affect expectations, we first regress, for each treatment
group combined with the control group, the change in the inflation expectations of agents from before
to after the information treatment on a dummy variable for their treatment group (equal to zero if in the
control group and one otherwise), that is,
𝐸
where 𝐸

𝜋−𝐸

𝜋 = 𝑎 + 𝑏 ∗ 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 + 𝜷𝑿 + 𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟 ,

𝜋 is the posterior forecast of individual i, 𝐸

(1)

𝜋 is their prior average belief, 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡

is the dummy variable, and 𝑿 is a vector of individual-specific controls. These include a quadratic
polynomial in the respondent’s age and a rich set of dummy variables for a respondent’s gender,
10

employment status, household income, household size, race, census region, spectra life style, and
spectra behavior stage.6 For the posterior forecasts of individuals, we use the forecast provided
immediately after the treatment as well as the forecasts provided three and six months later in followup waves. In Table 2, we report estimated values of b for each treatment group with and without these
individual controls.7 Note that b identifies the average change in expectations of agents in the
treatment group relative to the average change in the control group. Including the control group is
important because inflation expectations before and after the treatment are measured using questions
with different wording to elicit inflation expectations, so the control group serves to capture any effect
driven by wording. Because initial beliefs about inflation are biased upwards prior to the treatment,
this baseline specification focusing on the average revision provides a simple benchmark for assessing
the power of each treatment on expectations. We also study convergence in beliefs below. In each
regression, we use sampling weights in the regressions and use Huber regressions to control for
outliers and influential observations.
Consider first the placebo treatment. In this case, individuals were told that the population
growth of the U.S. was 2% over the last three years, a statement of little relevance to inflation but
which included the number 2%. This placebo helps identify the potential importance and size of
anchoring effects. We find very mild evidence for contemporaneous anchoring effects: the average
respondent in this group reduces their inflation forecast by 0.2-0.3%, or less than one-tenth of the
cross-sectional standard deviation of inflation expectations. These small anchoring effects have
completely dissipated by the first follow-up, and the inflation expectations of individuals in this group
are no different from those in the control group three and six months after the treatment.
We now turn to the direct treatments about inflation applied to three of the groups. One group
was told the most recent 12-month CPI inflation rate (2.3%), one group was told that the Federal
Reserve targets an inflation rate of 2%, and the third group was told that the FOMC was forecasting
an inflation rate of 1.9% over the next twelve months. The effects across these three groups are very
similar. On impact, all three reduce the average inflation forecast by 1.0-1.1% relative to the control
group. Hence, these very simple information treatments have large effects on the beliefs of
individuals. The responses are larger for individuals whose pre-treatment inflation expectations are
6

The last two variables are constructed by Nielsen to classify households into several types. Spectra life style has the
following categories: Cosmopolitan Centers; Affluent Suburban Spreads; Comfortable Country; Struggling Urban Cores;
Modest Working Towns; Plain Rural Living. Spectra behavior stage includes the following categories: Start Up Families;
Small Scale Families; Younger Bustling Families; Older Bustling Families; Young Transitionals; Independent Singles;
Senior Singles; Established Couples; Empty Nest Couples; Senior Couples

We find no evidence of nonlinear effects depending on the prior beliefs of respondents (see Appendix Figure 1).

greater than 2% (Appendix Table 3). These effects are mildly persistent. Three months later, the
average expectations of these treated individuals are still lower than those of the control group, with
the effect having dissipated by about 75%, and the effects have fully dissipated after six months.8
This persistence of information treatments is consistent with those observed in previous work
(Coibion et al. 2018b, Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Kumar 2018, Coibion, Gorodnichenko and
Ropele 2018, and Cavallo et al. 2017). Importantly, this persistence effect is not driven by a changing
composition across waves: we find nearly identical results when we restrict our attention to
individuals that participate in all waves (Appendix Table 5). 9 Furthermore, these results indicate that
all three treatments seem to convey broadly similar information to respondents, in that they adjust
their beliefs in a comparable manner despite the treatments being conceptually distinct.
The transitory nature of the effect of these treatments on inflation expectations reflects the
fact that the treatment itself seems to have only transitory effects on underlying knowledge. For
example, when some respondents were told about the Fed’s inflation target in the first wave as their
treatment, their recall of this information in subsequent waves was relatively low. We illustrate this
by running the same regression as before but using changes in beliefs about the FOMC’s target in the
two follow-up waves as dependent variables:
𝐸

,

𝐹𝑒𝑑𝑇𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 − 𝐸

𝐹𝑒𝑑𝑇𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 = 𝑎 + 𝑏 ∗ 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 + 𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟 .

(2)

The results are reported in Table 3. Within three months, being treated with the Fed’s inflation target
leads to modest revisions in beliefs about the target relative to priors before treatment. By six months,
the effect of the treatment has dissipated and the recall of this information is close to zero. Similar
results obtain for other treatments for which we measured the prior belief of respondents, which
includes the contemporaneous rate of inflation and the contemporaneous rate of unemployment. Table
3 shows that respondents similarly seem to forget the provided information about each within three
to six months. The very transitory nature of information treatments on inflation expectations therefore
seems to reflect the fact that respondents are unable to remember the information for more than a few
months. Therefore, policymakers that aim to influence inflation expectations of individuals might
have to engage in a more persistent form of communication given that simple, one-off messages are
not effective in moving expectations persistently.

8

The effect of being treated with the recent inflation rate is positive after six months, whereas we cannot reject the null
of zero effect for all other treatments. We conjecture that this positive effect is a statistical aberration, given little reason
exists why the treatment effect should become positive over time and no such effect exists for any other treatment group.
9
We also find no evidence of differential attrition rates across information treatments.

12

Going beyond these simple information treatments, the next treatment group was presented
with the entire statement released by the Federal Reserve following FOMC meetings. 10 Respondents
in May 2018 received the FOMC statement from the March 21 st 2018 FOMC meeting whereas those
who took the survey in June 2018 received the FOMC statement from the May 2 nd 2018 FOMC
meeting. Both statements describe recent developments in the economy similarly, including that
inflation had approached 2%, as well as the broader objectives of the Federal Reserve including its
symmetric 2% objective for the inflation rate. We describe differences in the two in more detail in the
next section. The statements, while not exceedingly long, are written in the dense language that is
typical of central bank communications. On impact, reading the statement from the FOMC has
approximately the same effect on inflation expectations as the previous three treatments, reducing the
average forecast by 1.2% relative to the control group. The effect of reading the FOMC statement
dissipates a little more rapidly, however, having no discernible effect on expectations relative to the
control group after three or six months.
Another treatment group was presented with a news article from the USA Today covering the
same FOMC meeting as the statement provided to the previous treatment group. 11 Those participating
in May 2018 were given an article summarizing the March FOMC decision while those participating
in June received an article summarizing the May FOMC decision. We describe differences between
the two in more detail in section 3.2. Both articles, each published the day after FOMC meetings, are
written in a much more accessible (and shorter) style that still transmits information about inflation
and the central bank’s objective. For example, the second sentence of the second article reads “The
Fed held its key interest rate steady Wednesday but noted that inflation has climbed closer to its 2%
goal, paving the way for another rate hike in June.” Participants who read this article reduced their
inflation expectations by only 0.5% points relative to the control group, less than half the effect of
any of the other inflation-related treatments. Despite the fact that the articles seemingly transmits the
same information about the central bank’s inflation objective as the FOMC statement or our
information treatment on the central bank’s target (as well as information about the most recent
inflation rate), this information appears to be discounted by households. With approximately the same
objective information content but only the source of the information varying, it seems that households
view information coming from the news media as being less reliable, leading them to place less weight

on it when they revise their views.12 However, its effect is relatively longer-lived, in that three months
after reading the article, the average effect on expectations remains half of its instantaneous effect,
but it too dissipates fully within six months after the information treatment.
Of course, households can form and change their beliefs about inflation using many different
types of information. To assess how other forms of information affect their views, we consider two
other types of information treatments. The first tells individuals that national gasoline prices rose 11%
over the previous three months.13 As documented in Table 2, this information about salient prices
leads to an immediate upward revision in households’ inflation expectations of approximately 1.41.5% relative to the control group, a pass-through of about 10%, well above the average expenditure
share of gasoline in consumption of 5% (Binder forthcoming). This excess sensitivity of individuals’
inflation expectations to gasoline prices is consistent with the evidence provided in Coibion and
Gorodnichenko (2015). However, this effect is relatively transitory. Within three months, individuals
in this treatment group have slightly lower inflation expectations than the control group and the effect
is again fully dissipated within six months. The extrapolation from salient prices like gas and groceries
to overall inflation expectations poses a challenge to central banks because their conventional policy
tools have little direct effect on these prices which is the reason why many central banks target
measures of core inflation that exclude these price series.
Second, we provide individuals with information about the most recent rate of unemployment.
All respondents in the first wave were initially asked what they thought was the current
unemployment rate in the U.S. Their average answer was 6.3% with a standard deviation of 3.9%.
Only 12 percent of respondents report unemployment rates less than or equal to 3.9%. Hence, when
respondents in this group were told the actual value of the unemployment rate in the previous month
of 3.9%,14 they were almost always being told that the unemployment rate was significantly lower
than what they believed. The result was an immediate downward revision in their inflation

12

We picked the USA Today as the article source to avoid the fact that other news sources like the New York Times or the
Wall Street Journal are often perceived to have partisan leanings which might lead some to discount the quality of the
information they provide. The USA Today, to the best of our knowledge, has no particular political association. Until
2016, the USA Today had never endorsed any presidential candidate. In the 2016 election, the Editorial Board declared
that it considered Donald Trump unfit for the presidency but did not explicitly endorse Hillary Clinton
(https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/09/29/dont-vote-for-donald-trump-editorial-board-editorialsdebates/91295020/).
13
Respondents participating in the May 2018 (June 2018) part of the survey were informed in this treatment that the actual
price of gasoline increased by 6.4% (11%). Consistent with this difference in the size of the treatment, we find that the
average change in beliefs of households surveyed in June was approximately twice as large as for those surveyed in May
conditional on being treated with the information about gasoline prices.
14
Respondents participating in the May 2018 wave were told that unemployment rate was 4.1%.

14

expectation, albeit a relatively small one, of 0.3%. This is the opposite of what one would expect if
households were perceiving this as a movement along a Phillips curve, in which case the reduction in
unemployment would have been associated with higher inflation. Instead, they seem to hold a supplyside view of unemployment and inflation, associating higher levels of one with the other. This is the
same pattern as that observed in Italian firms (Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Ropele, 2018) or in U.S.
households (Kamdar 2018). This information effect is still somewhat visible in inflation expectations
after three months but is also fully dissipated within six months.
Jointly, these results indicate that simple messages provided to households can have remarkably
powerful, albeit transient, effects on their expectations. We find no evidence that the complicated and
detailed information from FOMC statements have effects that are any more powerful than simply telling
households what inflation has been or what inflation rate the central bank is targeting. This means
communication strategies targeting households could potentially focus on presenting them with basic facts
about inflation and monetary policy without resorting to “Fed-speak”. The major caveat is that relying on
the media to transmit the central bank’s message is unlikely to be very successful: not only do many
households not follow news about monetary policy but even when exposed to news articles focusing
explicitly on monetary policy decisions, these news articles seem to be heavily discounted by the public
due to their source. The mild persistence in the treatment effects after three and six months also alleviates
concerns of experimenter demand effects. Moreover, de Quidt et al. (2018) show in settings similar to
ours that these effects are plausibly small.
3.2 Interpreting the USA Today Treatment Effects
The most striking feature of Table 2 is probably the fact that the USA Today treatment has a much
smaller effect than either simple messages about recent inflation, the Fed’s inflation target, or the
corresponding FOMC statement. To better understand this effect, we first exploit the fact that two
different versions of both the FOMC and USA Today treatments were presented in May and June.
The two FOMC statements are broadly similar, with the most noticeable difference being the language
with respect to inflation. In May 2018, it read
“On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy
have continued to run below 2 percent… Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to move
up in coming months and to stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the
medium term.”
whereas the June 2018 version is

15

“On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food or energy
have moved close to 2 percent. Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to run near the
Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective.”
The latter makes clear that inflation was close to and expected to remain around 2 percent whereas the
former points to recent inflation being lower but expected to rise to 2 percent.
To assess whether this difference in language about inflation matters, we consider whether the
revision in beliefs of households differs depending on which of these two treatments they received. The
results in Table 4 suggests that this language has little discernible effect: inflation expectations fell by
1.1% on average for those surveyed in May and 1.3% on average for those in June.
The language of the USA Today articles covering these FOMC decisions is also somewhat
different given the changing inflation outlook. In the article provided to households surveyed in May,
the FOMC decision is described as
“Citing a brighter economic outlook, the Federal Reserve raised its key short-term interest
rate Wednesday but maintained its forecast for a total of three hikes this year amid still-modest
inflation... [The federal funds rate] is still low by historical standards but it marks the central
bank’s fourth increase in the past 12 months and another vote of confidence in an economy
that’s picking up steam nearly nine years after the Great Recession ended. ‘We’re trying to
take that middle ground’ on rate hikes, boosting rates enough to head off an eventual spike in
inflation without derailing the economic expansion, Fed chairman Jerome Powell said at a
news conference.”
This article identifies that inflation is “modest” but emphasizes the upside potential to the economy and
the possibility of an eventual spike in inflation raised by Chairman Powell. The June article, following the
FOMC’s May 2nd decision to hold rates steady, takes a somewhat more ominous note:
“Inflation is creeping higher, and that’s making the Federal Reserve more confident about
raising interest rates. The Fed held its key interest rate steady Wednesday but noted that
inflation had climbed close to its 2% goal, paving the way for another rate hike in June… Fed
policymakers have forecast two more rate increases this year, according to their median
estimate, but faster inflation could trigger three additional moves.”
Like the corresponding FOMC statement, this article makes clear that recent inflation was close to 2%
and that its rise justified an expected path of rising interest rates.
Table 4 then considers whether the two different USA Today articles had differential effects on
inflation expectations. We find mild differences between the two: participants in the May sample revised
their inflation expectations downward by 0.6-0.7% on average while those in the June sample revised
their expectations by 0.3-0.4%, about half. While the darker language about rising inflation in the June
article therefore seems to have some effect on how individuals revise their beliefs, it remains the case that
revisions due to the USA Today treatment are much smaller than corresponding ones from the FOMC
16

treatments.15 Given that the FOMC statements and USA Today articles broadly conveyed the same
information and the USA Today article did so using less jargon, the stronger effect from FOMC statements
suggests that respondents discounted some of the information in the newspaper article.
To investigate the source of this discounting, we asked questions to participants in subsequent
(and unrelated) surveys of Nielsen households in June 2019. These individuals were asked to rate how
credible they viewed different news outlets as sources of information about the economy on a scale of 1
(very credible) to 5 (not credible). Results from more than 28,000 respondents presented in Table 5
indicate that U.S. households on average view newspapers as somewhat less reliable than television, the
government, and friends/coworkers as a source of news, with social media being reported as the most
credible news source of them all. We find smaller differences in the relative credibility of various
newspapers: the USA Today is perceived as more credible than the New York Times, Washington Post
or Wall Street Journal, but less credible than the Chicago Tribune or the Los Angeles Times.16 The
discounting of the USA Today by our survey respondents therefore does not appear to reflect the fact that
they view this particular newspaper as unreliable but rather a more widespread skepticism that traditional
media such as newspapers and television serve as a reliable source of news.
3.3 Convergence in Beliefs
While the results above describe the average change in beliefs after an information treatment, this does
not fully characterize how these treatments affect beliefs. For example, if agents act like Bayesians, their
beliefs after the information treatments should be a weighted average of their initial beliefs and the
treatment. If their initial beliefs were symmetrically distributed around the signal, one could observe no
change in average belief after a treatment, even though all households actually changed their beliefs in the
expected way. However, one would still expect to see a reduction in the cross-sectional post-treatment
dispersion of beliefs, since everyone moved toward the signal.
To assess whether this is the case in our experiment, we compare the cross-sectional dispersion of
beliefs across treatment groups both before and after the application of treatments. Unfortunately, the
presence of outliers makes the measurement of higher moments sensitive. Given this, we estimate the
dispersion of inflation expectations using robust methods. Specifically, we estimate the crosssectional standard deviation within each treatment group as 𝜎 = 1.4826 × 𝑀𝐴𝐷 where 𝑀𝐴𝐷 ≡
15

The other treatments regarding recent inflation, the inflation target and the Fed’s inflation forecast have similar effects
in May and June waves.
16
However, respondents chose “do not know” option for the Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times much more
frequently than for the other four newspapers. This may reflect a more regional nature of the Chicago Tribune and the
Los Angeles Times.

17

𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛 𝑋 − 𝑋

and 𝑋 ≡ 𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛(𝑋 ). We then normalize the standard deviation in each

treatment group and survey wave by the corresponding value from the control group in that same
wave. Hence, Table 6 reports robust 𝜎 by treatment group relative to control group for various stages
of the experiment. Note that we use the probability distribution question to compute mean inflation
prediction in columns (1), (3) and (4) and we use point predictions in column (2).
With the exception of the population growth treatment and the USA Today treatment, we find
large reductions in disagreement among each treatment group after being presented with information.
The declines are in the order of about 50% for each group, with some groups being even higher (e.g.
the inflation target or the FOMC statement lead to reductions in disagreement of about 70%). These
effects then dissipate in subsequent months. When looking at either the population growth or USA
Today treatments, we find much smaller declines in disagreement upon being presented with
information, approximately 15% declines on impact. Hence, as with the mean effects, we find much
more pronounced effects on the distribution of beliefs from simple messages involving inflation or
presentation of an actual FOMC statement than from news summaries of monetary policy decisions.
Another way to assess whether beliefs are converging after receiving common signals is to
directly quantify the weight that agents assign to signals they receive versus the weight they assign to
their priors beliefs. If they act as Bayesians, the weight they assign to the signal in updating their beliefs
should be the Kalman gain, and this weight should be increasing in the perceived precision of the signal.
The weight they assign to their prior belief should then be one minus the Kalman gain. We assess this
framework by regressing individuals’ posterior beliefs on their prior beliefs. We allow for both the
intercept and the slope coefficient to vary across groups since different signals have different values
and are likely to have different perceived precisions, leading to different gains associated with each.
The results of these regressions, across different horizons, are presented in Table 7. When
looking at the control group, one would expect an intercept of zero and a slope coefficient of one
since these individuals are receiving no additional information. However, because posterior beliefs
are measured using point forecasts while prior beliefs are measured using distributional questions, the
associated measurement error naturally leads to a coefficient on priors of less than one, and these
coefficients fall over time. This provides the benchmark relative to which we can measure the weight
assigned to different signals.
Consider first the results when individuals are presented with the inflation forecast of the
FOMC, a signal directly comparable to their own inflation forecast. The associated weight on their prior
belief is only around 0.2, meaning that they place a very high weight on this signal, i.e. it is perceived
18

as being very informative. These effects taper off over time however. These results explain why we
observe a strong and immediate decline in disagreement across the individuals who are presented with
this common source of information. Given that average priors are significantly higher than this signal,
this updating also accounts for the large average decline in expectations documented in Table 2 when
the treatment is received. Very similar results obtain when households are presented with information
about recent inflation, the Fed’s inflation target, or the FOMC statement. Strikingly, the weight on the
prior is significantly higher when presented with the USA Today article, consistent with households
treating this as a less informative signal. Information about gasoline prices, unemployment and
population growth also receive much less weight upon treatment, consistent with households either
perceiving these as less informative about inflation or something that is already largely known to them.
Jointly, these results confirm that consumers respond to signals about inflation in the expected
way. They systematically place weight on informative signals, leading to convergence in their beliefs
upon receiving common information. They also assign more weight to signals that are perceived as
more informative. While previous evidence for households has also largely been consistent with
Bayesian updating, we are the first, to the best of our knowledge, to find these results for such a large
group of households as well as being able to compare across a wide range of signals.
3.4 Heterogeneity
Do information treatments affect everyone equally? D’Acunto et al. (2016) find large differences in
how individuals adjust consumption plans to their inflation expectations by demographics. In this
section, we investigate this question in two ways. First, we decompose changes in beliefs within each
group into an extensive margin and an intensive margin. Second, we consider whether the effects of
information treatments on inflation forecasts differ along observable characteristics of respondents.
Such heterogeneity can be useful for policy-makers if they aim to affect the actions of specific subsets
of the population or if they are interested in maximizing the effects of communications on beliefs by
targeting specific subgroups that are more responsive.
We begin by decomposing average treatment effects on expectations into an extensive margin and
an intensive margin. A significant role for an extensive margin of expectations adjustment would suggest
that information treatments disproportionately affect subsets of agents. Because prior beliefs are measured
using distributional questions while posterior beliefs are measured using point forecasts, we cannot
identify the extensive margin through a zero change in forecast after treatments. Instead, we define an
individual as having a discrete change in expectations (i.e. participating along the extensive margin), if
19

their forecast changes by more than a specific threshold. As a benchmark, we use a 2% point change in
expectations as the threshold but alternative values ranging from 1% to 4% yield the same qualitative
results. This threshold applies to just over 50% of all respondents in the control group. We regress whether
an individual’s belief changed by more than the threshold on dummy variables for each treatment to
quantify the importance of the extensive margin. As illustrated in columns (3) and (4) of Table 8, the
extensive margin is almost never statistically significant and never economically significant.
Consistent with this, we can quantify the intensive margin by looking at the change in
expectations of individuals conditional on those changes exceeding the threshold. As illustrated in
columns (5) and (6) of Table 8, those changes are significantly larger in absolute value for the treatment
groups than in the control groups, generally by 2% points for most inflation-related treatments. Given
that the extensive margin applies to about 50% of respondents, this implies that the intensive margin can
effectively account for all of the post-treatment differences in average beliefs across groups.17 The results
in Table 8 also document that the difference in the treatment effect for the USA today treatment compared
to the other treatments is fully driven by the intensive margin. The fact we don’t find a difference in the
extensive margin across treatments suggests that it is less likely that the USA today treatment has less of
an effect than the other treatments because parts of the sample discounts this newspaper as an information
source but rather suggests that the content of the article was perceived as less informative.
The importance of the intensive margin of adjustment implies that we should focus on the size
of forecast revisions across agents rather than which respondents adjusted and which did not. We
therefore regress respondents’ revisions across treatment groups on a range of observable characteristics
along which they differ including gender, income (by tercile), education, race, access to and amount of
available credit, purchasing plans, wealth, savings behavior, and shopping behavior (e.g. if they are the
main person in the household that does the shopping or frequency of purchasing gasoline). The full set
of results are presented in Appendix Tables 1 and 2, and summary results for observable heterogeneity
are in Table 9. In each case, we focus on the specification which includes individual-specific controls
and uses the contemporaneous response of inflation forecasts as the dependent variable, but similar
results obtain at longer horizons.
There is surprisingly little heterogeneity in how respondents change their beliefs in response to
new information on average. For example, white and non-white individuals respond to information
treatments similarly. So do young, middle-aged and senior respondents. There is little variation between
17

Columns (7) and (8) verify that, for those individuals’ whose expectation revisions fall below the threshold used to identify
the extensive margin, differences in revision size relative to the control group have little statistical or economic power.

20

those who are planning to purchase big durable goods (cars, house, or other big-ticket items) and those
who are not. Political party does not seem to matter much, nor do we find systematic differences in
responses to information treatments based on shopping behavior. We also consider whether there are
systematic differences in responses to information depending on whether respondents have ready access
to credit, have any savings or wealth, and their savings rate: we again find little variation along these
dimensions. Gender, however, does seem to matter. Women respond more strongly to every information
treatment including the placebo treatment of population growth, with information about gasoline prices
being the only exception. The differences across the two groups are large in economic terms: women’s
responses are two to three times bigger than men’s to information treatments. This may reflect the fact
that men report more confidence in their beliefs about inflation, which should tend to lead toward less
weight being placed on new information. Income also matters for how individuals respond to
information. We find that those in the middle of the income distribution of respondents (income between
$40,000 and $100,000) respond significantly more to information about recent inflation or
unemployment, the Federal Reserve’s inflation target, the FOMC’s inflation forecast, FOMC
statements, as well as news reports about the FOMC’s decisions than either lower-income or higherincome respondents. Strikingly, lower-income individuals do not respond at all, on average, to the USA
Today news report about the FOMC meeting even though they respond strongly to most other
treatments. We find a similar result when we decompose households by education: those with no more
than a high school degree do not respond at all to the USA Today news report treatment, even though
they respond strongly to other information treatments.
Low-income and less-educated individuals are, on average, systematically less well-informed
about inflation and monetary policy. For example, in our survey, both low-income and less-educated
individuals have higher average beliefs about the Fed’s inflation target. Hence, one might think that
monetary policy-makers might be able to have the largest effects on the beliefs of these individuals by
providing them with information about inflation and monetary policy. What our results indicate,
however, is that these are also the individuals that are least likely to incorporate information about
inflation from the news media. This implies that traditional communications strategies of central banks,
which rely largely on the transmission of information via standard news outlets, are unlikely to be
successful and raises the concern that purely relying on these transmission channels results in
redistributive effects of monetary policy (see also Coibion et al. (2017) and D’Acunto et al. (2018b)).

Discussion

The narrative around inflation expectations that is commonly promoted by central bankers is that 1)
inflation expectations are important for inflation dynamics, 2) they are anchored to the inflation target
as a result of the credibility of the central bank, and 3) this anchoring is a source of economic stability.
The first point was most clearly illustrated by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell when he said
in Congressional testimony that inflation expectations were the most important driver of inflation.18
The second point was emphasized by the President of the San Francisco Federal Reserve, Mary Daly:
“Once inflation was under control, the Fed committed to keeping it that way. This
commitment became a well-known and accepted position that people could depend on. And
it ushered the conditions that dominate today –the era of well-anchored expectations…”
The third step in their argument is summarized by Mary Daly simply as “when the Fed is credible,
it’s easier for the economic system to absorb shocks…” while the mechanism underlying it is
described in more detail by Chairman Powell in the following:
“Anchored [inflation] expectations give a central bank greater flexibility to stabilize both
unemployment and inflation. When a central bank acts to stimulate the economy to bring
down unemployment, inflation might push above the bank's inflation target. With expectations
anchored, people expect the central bank to pursue policies that bring inflation back down,
and longer-term inflation expectations do not rise. Thus, policy can be a bit more
accommodative than if policymakers had to offset a rise in longer-term expectations. … I am
confident that the FOMC would resolutely "do whatever it takes" should inflation expectations
drift materially up or down.”
Our results, using one of the largest surveys of U.S. households’ expectations ever conducted,
contradict this comforting narrative along a number of dimensions. We find little evidence that people
know and accept the Fed’s commitment to a low inflation target. Many individual respondents are
unwilling to even guess what the Fed’s inflation target is, and of those that do few answer correctly.
Households’ average perceptions of recent inflation are quite different from actual inflation and their
inflation forecasts bear little resemblance to those of the FOMC. When presented with the most basic
facts about inflation or monetary policy, their views change dramatically. The limited evidence on U.S.
firms’ inflation expectations closely resembles that of households and available evidence from other
advanced economies yields similar messages for both households and firms (see Coibion,
18

See https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-15/fed-puts-inflation-expectations-at-heart-of-major-policyreview.

22

Gorodnichenko and Pedemonte 2018 for a review). The notion that most U.S. citizens, those individuals
signing the wage and rental agreements at the heart of the mechanism described by Chairman Powell,
have well-anchored expectations therefore flies in the face of the available evidence.
We view this as having a number of potentially important implications that call both for future
work as well as renewed consideration by policy-makers. First is the notion of the credibility of the
Federal Reserve and comparable central banks. In an era where central banks in advanced economies
are coming under intense criticism from politicians and populist movements, they should not assume
that their credibility with the broader public will help protect their independence. While professional
forecasters and some financial market participants may have embraced the Fed’s inflation target, the
broader public has not. The lack of public understanding of just how successful modern central banking
has been in the last thirty years makes central banks an easy target for populist leaders. Communication
campaigns that describe, in easy to understand messages, what inflation rate the central bank targets
and how close to that target inflation has been on average could boost not only the average knowledge
about inflation of the broader population but also, as a result, the credibility of central banks. Central
banks, however, should not stop here but should also explain in detail the benefits of stable prices and
the implications of changes in inflation expectations for economics choices. Many households in the
US perceive persistent deflation as desirable and have little knowledge about basic economic concepts
such as the consumer Euler equation (D’Acunto et al. 2018a).
A second implication of our results, and one that is more positive for central banks, is the scope
for how potentially powerful communications policies toward the broader public could be. We find that
simple information treatments that reach the public can easily move inflation expectations by over one
hundred basis points. Relative to quantitative easing policies or forward guidance, this suggests that
policy-makers may be able to change perceived real interest rates of households and firms in a
quantitatively important way through new communications strategies, a feature that could be immensely
useful at the zero bound on nominal interest rates. Doing so will require much more systematic evaluation
of how different types of information affect the expectations of economic agents as well as formal models
that characterize how these signals affect expectations and decisions as well as their general equilibrium
implications. Intuitively, the decline in both the level and volatility of inflation since the early 1980s has
lowered the benefit of being informed about inflation for households, leading to pervasive inattention on
their part.19 To offset this force, policy-makers would need to reduce the price of collecting and
19

This is consistent with the fact that households in higher and more volatile inflation environments are more informed
about inflation and monetary policy than those in living in low and stable inflation environments. It is also consistent with

23

processing this information for households, which would require simpler communication strategies that
reach individuals in a more direct and systematic manner. The simple messages about inflation resulted
in an average revision in forecasts of more than 1%. According to estimates in Bhattarai and Neely
(2018), the first quantitative-easing program (QE1) of the Federal Reserve Bank amounted to $1.725
trillion and resulted in a reduction in interest rates of only 0.34 percentage points. Crump et al. (2015)
estimate an average subjective intertemporal elasticity of substitution of around 0.5 using expectations
data from the New York Fed Survey of Consumer Expectations. Hence, our estimates imply that the
change in inflation expectations of 1.2% would translate into a change in real consumption growth of
0.6%. This is twice the growth in current dollars personal consumption expenditure in June 2019 from
the previous months and amounts to about $82.0 billion.20
A third implication for central banks has to do with the policy framework to use: e.g. inflation
targeting vs price level targeting. The Federal Reserve system is beginning a process of reviewing its
policy objectives and procedures in which, in particular, it is considering whether to adopt price level
targeting in lieu of inflation targeting. The rationale for doing so is that, when the economy is facing
the zero bound on interest rates, a price level targeting regime entails that inflation must be higher
than the target after the zero bound ends, as this will be necessary to make up for the low inflation
that occurs during the zero bound period. The expectation of higher future inflation while at the zero
bound is predicted to be stimulative in New Keynesian models since higher expected inflation implies
lower perceived real interest rates and therefore higher demand on the part of households. Price level
targeting can therefore help stabilize economic outcomes during zero bound episodes relative to
inflation targeting regimes. However, these effects hinge on households’ inflation expectations
correctly incorporating the effects of the regime and the zero bound such that they anticipate higher
inflation than the target after the zero bound period ends. The absence of knowledge of what the target
rate even is (documented in Figure 1) as well as the disconnect between household inflation
expectations and recent inflation suggests that such a mechanism is unlikely to be effective as long
as U.S. households remain as uninformed about inflation and monetary policy as they have been. Any
change in regime on the part of U.S. policymakers should be accompanied by a massive and persistent
communication campaign aimed at the broader public if it is to deliver any of the putative gains
associated with price level targeting.

the evolution of inflation expectations over time in the U.S. as inflation went from high and volatile in the 1970s to low
and stable in the 1980s. See Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Pedemonte (2018).

Conclusion

In times of low interest rates, central banks have increasingly turned to forward guidance and other
communications strategies to affect economic activity. However, these strategies have focused
primarily on communicating with financial markets rather than the broader public. Since many
expectations channels run through households and firms, central banks could also aim to affect
economic conditions via direct communications to the public. In this paper, we present new evidence
that such communications can change expectations by economically significant magnitudes: simple
messages about the central bank’s inflation target have implications about real interest rates that dwarf
those typically found for monetary policy announcements. However, we find that the effectiveness of
these messages to the public is significantly dampened when transmitted via news media: households
effectively dismiss much of the information content when presented to them in the form of a news
article. This suggests that, if central banks want to add direct communications to the public as a new
policy tool, they will have to find new ways to reach the public without relying on traditional media.

Notes: The table reports average values and cross-sectional standard deviations of expected inflation over the next
twelve months (columns 1-2), perceived inflation over the previous twelve months (columns 3-4) and beliefs about
the Federal Reserve’s inflation target (columns 5-6). Rows indicate which subset of the sample is used. HTM
stands for “hand to mouth” and indicates the amount of savings measured in monthly spending for a given
household. All means and standard deviations are constructed from Huber robust regressions on a constant using
sampling weights. Each row captures an observable characteristic of the respondent on which we condition.

Notes: The table reports the average change in inflation expectations of individuals in each treatment group relative
to those in the control group. Columns (1) and (2) consider the immediate change in expectations after the
treatment, columns (3) and (4) consider the changes in beliefs after three months, columns (5) and (6) report
changes in beliefs over a six month horizon. In each case, differences in beliefs are measured relative to initial
beliefs from the first wave measured before all treatments. Treatments are described in detail in the text. For each
time horizon, the second column uses the same specification as in the first column but augmented with respondentspecific controls. Results are from Huber robust regressions to control for outliers and influential observations.
Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses.

Notes: The table reports the average changes in beliefs about variables being treated after 3 months (columns 1-2)
and 6 months (3-4) relative to changes reported in the control group. In Panel A, we report how respondents in the
group that received information about the Fed’s inflation target revised their beliefs about the inflation target over
time. In Panel B, we report how respondents in the group that received information about recent inflation revised
their beliefs about recent inflation rates over time. In Panel C, we report how respondents in the group that received
information about recent unemployment revised their beliefs about the unemployment rate over time. For each
time horizon, the second column uses the same specification as in the first column but augmented with respondentspecific controls. Results are from Huber robust regressions to control for outliers and influential observations.
Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses.

Notes: The table reports scores to questions about the credibility of news sources (top panel) and the credibility
of specific newspapers (bottom panel). In each case, respondents were asked to rate credibility on a scale of 1
(very credible) to 5 (not credible). Column (1) reports mean credibility scores across all respondents, column (2)
reports the standard deviation of those scores across respondents, while column (3) reports the fraction of
respondents who claimed that they did not know about the credibility of each source. 28,507 respondents provided
their assessments.

Notes: Columns (1) and (2) reproduce average effects of different information treatments on inflation expectations relative to control groups from Table 2, with controls for observable
characteristics of households in column (2). Columns (3) and (4) assess the extensive margin of treatment effects, defined as the probability of a change in each household’s inflation
expectation exceeding a threshold defined as a change in inflation expectation of 2% for each treatment group, relative to control group, with column (4) conditioning on observable
characteristics of the individual. Columns (5) and (6) assess the intensive margin of treatment effects, defined as the size of the change in a household’s inflation expectation,
conditional on that change in expectation exceeding a threshold defined as a change in inflation expectation of 2% for each treatment group, relative to control group, with column
(6) conditioning on observable characteristics of the individual. Columns (7) and (8) assess the average size of change in expectations for those individuals whose change in
expectation was below the threshold used to define the extensive margin, (i.e. 2% for each treatment group, relative to control group, with column (6) conditioning on observable
characteristics of the individual.

Notes: The table reports the average change in inflation expectations of individuals in each treatment group relative to those in the control group, broken down along observable
characteristics of individuals. Columns (1) and (2) separate households by gender, columns (3) to (5) consider where individuals rank in the income distribution of all respondents
by tercile, columns (6) to (8) classify respondents using the highest level of education in the household, columns (9) to (11) classify respondents based on their political affiliations.
In each case, revisions in beliefs are measured using the inflation forecasts at the end of the first wave of the survey relative to initial beliefs from the first wave measured before all
treatments. Treatments are described in detail in the text. Results are from Huber robust regressions to control for outliers and influential observations. Robust standard errors are
reported in parentheses.

You are almost done with the survey. We have just a few more questions. But before you give us your responses, we
would like you to know the following.
SHOW IF Group 1: Over the last twelve months, the inflation rate in the U.S. (as measured by the Consumer Price Index)
was 2.3%.
SHOW IF Group 2: The inflation target of the Federal Reserve is 2% per year.
SHOW IF Group 3: The price of gasoline (national average) rose by 6.4% over the last three months.
SHOW IF Group 4: The U.S. population grew 2% over the last three years.
SHOW IF Group 5: The current rate of unemployment in the U.S. is 4.1%.
SHOW IF Group 6: The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (which sets short-term interest rates) forecasts 1.9%
inflation rate in 2018.
SHOW IF Group 7 [May 2018 version]: Please read the most recent policy statement by the U.S. Federal Open Market
Committee.
Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the labor market has
continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been strong in recent
months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Recent data suggest that growth rates of household spending and
business fixed investment have moderated from their strong fourth-quarter readings. On a 12-month basis, both overall
inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have continued to run below 2 percent. Market-based
measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain low; survey-based measures of longerterm inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The
economic outlook has strengthened in recent months. The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the
stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market
conditions will remain strong. Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to move up in coming months and to stabilize
around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly
balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.
In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for
the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby
supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.
In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will
assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent
inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market
conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international
developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric
inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual
increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected
to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as
informed by incoming data.

SHOW IF Group 8 [May 2018 version]: On March 21, 2018, USA Today summarized the most recent decision of the
U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (which sets short-term interest rates) as follows:
"Citing a brighter economic outlook, the Federal Reserve raised its key short-term interest rate Wednesday but maintained
its forecast for a total of three hikes this year amid still-modest inflation.
The move is expected to ripple through the economy, nudging consumer and business borrowing costs higher, especially
for variable-rate loans such as adjustable-rate mortgages and credit cards.
Investors cheered the unchanged rate forecast for 2018, pushing up the Dow Jones industrial average about 250 points
initially before stocks pared their gains.
The Fed’s policymaking committee, as widely anticipated, lifted the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other
for overnight loans — by a quarter percentage point to a range of 1½% to 1¾%.
That’s still low by historical standards but it marks the central bank’s fourth rate increase in the past 12 months and
another vote of confidence in an economy that’s picking up steam nearly nine years after the Great Recession ended.
"We're trying to take that middle ground" on rate hikes, boosting rates enough to head off an eventual spike in inflation
without derailing the economic expansion, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a news conference. The meeting was the
first led by Powell, a Republican and Trump appointee, who took the reins from Democrat Janet Yellen last month."
SHOW IF Group 8 [June 2018 version]: On May 2, 2018, USA Today summarized the most recent decision of the U.S.
Federal Open Market Committee (which sets short-term interest rates) as follows:

WASHINGTON — Inflation is creeping higher, and that’s making the Federal Reserve more confident about raising
interest rates.
The Fed held its key interest rate steady Wednesday but noted that inflation has climbed close to its 2% goal, paving the
way for another rate hike in June.
As expected, the Fed kept its benchmark short-term interest rate at a range of 1½% to 1¾%. The central bank’s
policymaking committee lifted the rate by a quarter percentage point in March for the sixth time since late 2015 after
holding it near zero for years following the 2008 financial crisis and recession.
In a statement after a two-day meeting, the Fed reiterated that it plans to continue to raise rates gradually, a pace that
economists have interpreted as roughly every other meeting.
Fed policymakers have forecast two more rate increases this year, according to their median estimate, but faster inflation
could trigger three additional moves. Before the statement release, Fed fund futures indicated a 90% chance of a hike in
June, according to CME Group.

Notes: The table reports the average change in inflation expectations of individuals in each treatment group relative to those in the control group, broken down along observable
characteristics of individuals. Columns (1) and (2) differentiate respondents by whether they report having enough credit on their credit cards to make an emergency payment equal
to one month of their salary. Columns (3)-(5) differentiate respondents by the amount of their total liquid savings (checking plus savings accounts) relative to their monthly income.
Columns (6) and (7) differentiate respondents by whether they plan to buy a car, house or other big ticket item over the next six months. Columns (8) and (9) differentiate between
households depending on whether they report having any positive financial wealth. Columns (10) to (12) differentiate between respondents depending on what fraction of their
monthly income they report having saved each of the last 12 months on average. In each case, revisions in beliefs are measured using the inflation forecasts at the end of the first
wave of the survey relative to initial beliefs from the first wave measured before all treatments. Treatments are described in detail in the text. Results are from Huber robust regressions
to control for outliers. Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses.

Notes: The table reports the average change in inflation expectations of individuals in each treatment group relative to those in the control group, broken down along observable
characteristics of individuals. Columns (1) and (2) differentiate respondents by their race. Columns (3) and (4) differentiate respondents by whether they report being the sole shopper
for their household or share the shopping with others. Columns (5) to (7) differentiate respondents by the number of bins on which they assign positive probabilities when completing
the distributional inflation expectations question. Columns (8) to (10) differentiate respondents based on the amount of seconds it took them to complete the distributional inflation
expectations question. In each case, revisions in beliefs are measured using the inflation forecasts at the end of the first wave of the survey relative to initial beliefs from the first
wave measured before all treatments. Treatments are described in detail in the text. Results are from Huber robust regressions to control endogenously for outliers. Robust standard

Notes: The table reports the average change in inflation expectations of individuals in each treatment group relative to those in the control group, broken down by age of the
respondent. Column (1) uses individuals aged 40 or less, column (2) uses individuals with ages from 41 to 60, and column (3) uses individuals aged 61 or more. In each case,
revisions in beliefs are measured using the inflation forecasts at the end of the first wave of the survey relative to initial beliefs from the first wave measured before all treatments.
Treatments are described in detail in the text. Results are from Huber robust regressions to control endogenously for outliers. Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses.

Notes: The table reports the average change in inflation expectations of individuals in each treatment group relative to those in the control group, broken down along observable
characteristics of individuals. Columns (1) and (2) differentiate respondents by their race. Columns (3) and (4) differentiate respondents by whether they report being the sole shopper
for their household or share the shopping with others. Columns (5) to (7) differentiate respondents by the number of bins on which they assign positive probabilities when completing
the distributional inflation expectations question. Columns (8) to (10) differentiate respondents based on the amount of seconds it took them to complete the distributional inflation
expectations question. In each case, revisions in beliefs are measured using the inflation forecasts from the second wave of the survey relative to initial beliefs from the first wave
measured before all treatments. Treatments are described in detail in the text. Results are from Huber robust regressions to control endogenously for outliers. Robust standard errors
are reported in parentheses.

Notes: The table reports the average change in inflation expectations of individuals in each treatment group relative to those in the control group, broken down along observable
characteristics of individuals. Columns (1) and (2) separate households by gender, columns (3) to (5) consider where individuals rank in the income distribution of all respondents
by tercile, columns (6) to (8) classify respondents using the highest level of education in the household. In each case, revisions in beliefs are measured using the inflation forecasts
from the second wave of the survey relative to initial beliefs from the first wave measured before all treatments. Treatments are described in detail in the text. Results are from Huber
robust regressions to control endogenously for outliers. Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses.

Notes: The table reports average values and cross-sectional deviations of expected inflation over the next twelve months (columns 1-3), perceived inflation over the
previous twelve months (columns 4-6) and beliefs about the Federal Reserve’s inflation target (columns 7-9). Data are not restricted/filtered in any way. Rows
indicate which subset of the sample is used. Each row captures an observable characteristic of the respondent on which we condition. All moments are computed
using the Huber robust method.

Notes: The table reports the average change in inflation expectations of individuals in each treatment group relative to those in the control group. Columns (1) and
(2) consider the immediate change in expectations after the treatment, columns (3) and (4) consider the changes in beliefs after three months, columns (5) and (6)
report changes in beliefs over a six month horizon. In each case, differences in beliefs are measured relative to initial beliefs from the first wave measured before all
treatments. Treatments are described in detail in the text. For each time horizon, the second column uses the same specification as in the first column but augmented
with respondent-specific controls. Results are from Huber robust regressions to control for outliers and influential observations. Robust standard errors are reported
in parentheses. Only respondents who participate in all waves are included.
