Strikes and Wazes: A Test of a Signalling Model

Abstract

This paper, describes a simple model of labor disputes based on the
hypothesis that unions use strikes to infer the level of profitability
of the firm.

The implications of the model are then tested using data

on wage outcomes, strike probabilities, and strike durations for

a

large sample of collective bargaining agreements. Negotiated wages are
found to depend negatively on regional unemployment rates and
positively on industry-specific selling prices.

Contrary to the basic

premis of the model, however, there is no evidence of
relation between wages and strike outcomes.

a

systematic

Increases in unemployment

are found to decrease the probability of strikes, while increases in
industry selling prices increase the probability of disputes.

Strike

durations are only weakly related to unemployment and industry prices,
but are negatively correlated with industry output.

Strikes and Wages:

An Empirical Test of a Signallina Model

It has long been recognized that any consistent theoretical model of
strikes must appeal to some form of imperfect

information)

a

Recently,

great deal of progress in the theoretical analysis of strikes has been made
by focusing on the simple case of one-sided asysunetric information,2 In
this setup,

the underlying profitability of the firm is unknown to union

members, and a strike is used by workers to price discriminate against more
profitable employers.

This class of models is appealing not only for its

ability to explain the occurrence of costly disputes, but also for the
richness of its empirical implications.

Simple signalling-typemodels

specify the determinants of the probability and duration of disputes,

as

well as the relation between observed wage settlements and their associated
strike outcomes.3
This paper is an attempt to test both sets of implications using wage
end strike information for a large sample of collective bargaining
agreements from the Canadian manufacturing sector.

rates and strike outcomes in terms of a small set of underlying parameters:

available to workers elsewhere in the economy, and the risk preferences of

emphasized by Hicks (1963) and many subsequent authors, including in
particular Ashenfelter and Johnson (1969). Kennan (1986) provides a brief
summary of the historical development of theoretical models of strikes.

of strikes are explored by Fudenberg, Levine, and Ruud (1985), Tracy

models

union members.4 The model predicts the existence of a simple concession
schedule relating lower wage settlements to longer strikes.

In addition,

the model describes the effects of the predetermined variables on wage

settlements and strike probability and duration.
In the second section of the paper these predictions are tested
against the contract data.

Industry-specific output and selling prices and

regional unemployment rates are used as indicators for the expected
profitability of the firm and the alternative opportunities of workers.
Models are fit for the negotiated wage rate, the probability of disputes,
and the conditional duration of work stoppages.

In all cases these models

include firm-and-union-specificbargaining pair effects,

to abstract from

any systematic differences across pairs.
The results of the empirical analysis do not yield much support for
the model,

On one hand, there is no evidence of a systematic negative (or

positive) tradeoff between wages and strike duration.

On the other hand,

while the reduced form relation between wage and strike outcomes and
regional unemployment is consistent with the predictions of the model, the
relation with industry-specific selling prices is not.

Other findings also

cast doubt on the model, including a strong correlation between wildcat
strikes and subsequent contract strikes, and the finding that unexpected
real wage changes during the previous contract lead to higher wages and
reduced strike activity in the next one.

A simple model of strikes and

wages with one-sided asymmetric information does not capture all the
features of the wage and strike outcomes in this data set.

4The model is similar to ones developed by Hayes (1984) and Morton
(1983).

A SimDle Sianalling Model of Strikes
This section outlines a simple model of disputes based on the

hypothesis that unions use strikes to price discriminate against more
profitable employers.5 Bargaining power in the model rests with the union,
who make take-it or leave-it offers to the firm.

6

With complete

information on the state of demand, the union sets higher wages in highdemand states, and lower wages in low-demand states.

If demand is not

directly observable, however, the union cannot rely on the firm to reveal
its private information.

Nonetheless, the union can improve upon the

strategy of a fixed wage demand by offering the firm a downward sloping
wage-strike schedule.

Faced with such a schedule, the firm chooses a

shorter strike and a higher wage in high-demand states, and a longer strike
and a lower wage in low-demand states.

Strikes therefore serve as a signal

for the state of demand, enabling the union to price discriminate against
more profitable employers.

Hayes (1984) and Morton (1983). The model presented here is more similar

between the no-strike wage and the wage after the longest possible strike
is oniy 1.01 percent.

By comparison,

if workers were risk neutral they

would demand a wage 20.4 percent above the minimum realization of
productivity and strike for the full period otherwise.
In summary, the signalling model of strikes identifies two important
determinants of strike incidence and duration:

the dispersion in

profitability, and the gap between alternative wages and average
productivity at the firm.

Increases

in dispersion of the unobservable

component of profitability increase the probability and duration of
strikes.

Increases in the mean level of productivity at the firm reduce

13
the probability and duration of strikes,

wage decrease both.

while increases in the alternative

Expected strike duration is also a function of the

willingness of workers to sacrifice wages during low-demand periods in
return for higher wsges in high-demand periods.

In the model presented

here, this willingness is captured by the index of risk aversion.

The signalling model implies that negotiated wage rates depend on the
same set of exogenous variables. Wages are predicted to increase with the
mean and dispersion of profitability, and increase with the alternative
wage.

Furthermore, holding constant these variables, wages are a

decreasing function of strike duration.

Given the range of empirical

estimates of mean and maximum strike duration, however, the model suggests
that the gap between wage settlements reached with and without a work
stoppage may be relatively modest.
In the following sections, these predictions are tested using a sample
of labor contracts from the Canadian manufacturing sector.

I aaauxne that

variation over time in wage rates, strike probabilities and expected strike
durations arises from variation in the alternative wage opportunitiea of
workers (measured by regional unemployment rates and aggregate wages
elsewhere in the economy) and variation in the expected profitability of
the firm (measured by industry specific indexes of output and selling
prices).

I first investigate whether or not there is any evidence of a

negatively sloped concession schedule between wage settlements and strike
duration,

holding constant the observable determinants of wages.

The

existence of such a schedule is the most direct implication of the
hypothesis that strikes serve as a mechanism for price discrimination among

Data Description and Measurement Issues
This section provides an overview of the contract data used to teit the

model of strikes developed in the previous Section.

In addition,

the

measure of contractual wage rates used in the empirical analysis is
introduced and analyzed.
lIa. Sample Description

The empirical analysis in this paper is based on a sample of collective
bargaining agreements negotiated in the Canadian manufacturing sector from
1964 to 1985.

The original source of these data is the December 1985

release of Labour Canada's Wage Tape, which contains information on wage
rates and other provisions for 2868 contracts

covering 500 or more

employees.13 Starting from this sample, I have merged together agreements

12This point is emphasized by McConnell

(1987b)

l3 am grateful to Labour Canada for supplying these data.
Information on the methodology used to collect and code the data are
recorded in the Labour Canada publication Major Wage Settlements (Appendix
I). At present, Labour Canada collects data on virtually all collective
bargaining agreements covering more than 500 workers.

15

between the same firm and union pair covering different establishments)'4
and eliminated bargaining pairs with fewer than four consecutive contracts.
The final sample contains 2258 contracts r.egotiated by 299 distinct pairs.
Although the Wage Tape contains relatively complete information on
contractual wage rates, the only strike information is an indicator for the
stage at which the agreement was reached.15 Fortunately, beginning and

ending dates for disputes involving more than 100 workers are reported
annually in the Labour Canada publication Strikes and Lockouts in Canada
(jQ).

I therefore merged strike duration information from

contract data set.

Each of these
records the same wage rate and strike information, but pertains to a
different plant or group of plants. The Data Appendix describes the rules
used for merging contracts.

15Canadian labor law, which varies somewhat by province, requires the
bargaining parties to pass through one or more stages of mediation (or
"conciliation") before a strike or lockout is declared, See Canadian
Department of Labour (1970) pp. 135-136.

Measurement of Contract Wage Rates

that link quarterly, semi-annual, or annual increases to changes in the
consumer price index.
Figure 2 illustrates the intra-contractevolution of real wage rates in
three major subsamples of contracts: two-year non-indexed contracts;

three-

year non-indexed contracts; and three-year indexed contracts.21 The
underlying data are recorded in Appendix Table 1.

As the figure shows,

real wage rates typically move in a narrow corridor over the life of the
contract.

Among three-year contracts (both indexed and non-indexed),

the

average change in real wage rates from the beginning to the end of the
contract was about -l percent. Among two-year non-indexed contracts,

by

comparison, the average change was about -4 percent. The more rapid erosion
of real wage rates among two-year as compared to three-year non-indexed
contracts reflects the higher average annual rate of inflation among the
former group (6.5 percent versus 5.1 percent). The average inflation rate
was even higher among the sample of three-year indexed contracts (7.2
percent per year), but the effect on real wage rates was offset by the
escalation provisions in these contracts.
One natural summary measure of the wage provisions in a multi-year
labor contract is the average real wage rate during the term of the
contract.

The real wage rates reported in Tables 1 and 2 are of this form,

with the averages taken over wage rates measured at six-month intervals.
Except in very rare instances,

however, real wage rates during the term of

21The sample contains 728 non-indexed contracts with durations between
23 and 25 months, 355 non-indexed contracts with durations between 35 and
37 months, and 381 indexed contracts with durations between 35 and 37
months. Together, these three groups make up 65 percent of the contract
sample.

20
the contract are not set directly by the bargaining parties22

Rather

the

parties specify a schedule of nominal wage increases and, in the case of an
escalated contract, a partial indexation formula.

This suggests that an

average of expected real wage rates is a more appropriate ex ante summary
of the wage provisions in a long-term collective bargaining agreement.23
Unfortunately, expected real wage rates are not directly observable
and must be inferred from the nominal wage provisions of the collective
bargaining agreement and some measure of expected prices.

To see the

nature of the measurement problem, let w(m) represent the logarithm of the

real

wage rate during month m of the contract,

and let w

(m)

represent the

parties' expectation of w(m) as of the negotiation date of the contract.

expected rate by

*
in prices, w(m) and w (m) are related by:
*
(10) w(m) — w (m) - (l-e)(p(m) - p (m)).

*

Most escalated labor contracts, however, do not specify a fixed elasticity
of indexation.

Instead,

they specify a fixed absolute increase in wages

22The only case in which intra-contract real wage rates are set
directly is that of an indexed contract in which nominal wage rates
increase at the same proportional rate as the aggregate price index.
Indexation formulas of this type are extremely rare: see Card (1983).
23Th1s measure of wage rates was first proposed by McConnell (1987b).
Figure 2 also suggests that the real wage at the start of the contract may
be a useful summary of contractual wages. The empirical results in this
paper are unchanged when this simple summary measure is used.

for each point increase in the consumer price index.

In addition,

some

escalated contracts restrict the range of price increases covered by
indexation,

either by limiting the maximum escalated wage increase, or by

specifying a trigger price level that must be reached before indexation
begins.24 In such contracts,

the elasticity of indexation varies over the

This equation makes clear that there are two sources of error in the
measurement of expected real wage rates: errors in the measurement of e
(which arise only in the case of an indexed contract);

and errors in the

measurement of expected future prices.
In this paper I estimate the elasticity of indexation by the ratio of
total escalated wage increases over the life of the contract (in
percentage
terms) to the total increase in prices over the life of the contract.

This

estimator has the advantage that it does not require detailed information
on the cost-of-living escalation formula in the contract.25 On the other

hand,

it introduces some inaccuracy into the calculation of expected real

wage rates, particularly for contracts with restricted escalation
clauses.26 I also use simple autoregressive models of the consumer price
index to form estimates of the expected price level during the contract
period.

Table 3 compares alternative measures of the contractual wage provisions
for the overall contract sample and for the subsamples of indexed and non-

indexed agreements.

The upper panel of the table reports means and standard

deviations of three wage measures:

the average real wage rate during the

term of the contract (formed from monthly intra-contractwage rates sampled
at 6-month intervals) and two averages of expected intra-contract real
wage rates (again, based on monthly wage rates sampled at 6-month
intervals).

The averages of expected wage rates differ by the model used

to forecast future price increases.

In the first case (referred to in the

table as forecast method I) future prices are estimated from a model that
predicts the one-month ahead inflation rate using a constant and the
average inflation rate over the previous 12 months. The coefficients of
this forecasting model are obtained from a regression equation estimated
over the 1954-85 period.27 In the second case (referred to in the table as
26For example, an escalation clause with a trigger formula may have
generated no increase in wages in a contract for which actual price
increases were smaller than expected. Thus the estimate of e is zero, even
though the elasticity of indexation may have been non-zero for prices close
to the expected price level.
27The fitted equation is DP — .00958 + .8576 DPl2, where DPt is the
change in the logarithm of the consumer price index during the current
month (at an annual rate), and DPl2t is the change in the logarithm of the
consumer price index over the previous 12 months. This equation generates
a forecast for the rate of change in prices over the next 36 months, for
example, of .026 + .6135

DPl2.

23
forecast method 2) future price increases are estimated from a model that
predicts the one-month ahead inflation rate using the lagged monthly
inflation rate, the monthly inflation rate 12 months ago, and an estimated
constant and trend.28 The coefficients of this forecasting equation are
estimated from monthly data for the 10 years prior to the year in which the
forecast is made.29 Forecasts from the second method are therefore based on
data that were available to the bargaining parties at the time of their
negotiations.
The lower panel of Table 3 gives means and standard deviations of the
forecast errors in average wage rates associated with the two forecasting
methods. The mean forecast errors for both methods are essentially zero.
In all three samples, however, the standard deviations of the forecast

errors for the first forecasting method are lower.

This is apparently due

to the fact that the forecasts from the second method, which are based on a
series of sliding regressions with linear trend terms, tend to "over-shoot'
major turning points in the inflationary process.30
28Thjs model seems to perform best among the class of models that
forecast monthly inflation rates using the monthly rates in the previous 12
months.
comparison of the estimated autoregressive coefficients from
various subsamples of the 1954-85 period revealed that these coefficients
are remarkably stable over time. On the other hand, the estimated constant
and trend terms in the equation vary significantly over time. In view of
this fact, I restricted the autoregressive coefficients to be the same in
the forecasting equations for the various subsarnples. The fitted
forecasting equations therefore have the form:

lila. Models of Contractual Wage

Ra

As a first step toward an empirical teat of the signalling model of
strikes, this section specifies a number of alternative statistical models
for the wage measures introduced above.

I first estimate a components-of-

variance model of wages that includes bargaining-pair effects as well as
market-level determinants of wages, including unemployment rates and
measures of industry demand.

I next investigate

the effects of real wage

movements during the preceding contract on subsequent wage rates.

These

models are then used in the following section to test the existence of a
negatively sloped concession schedule between wages and strike duration.
To begin the analysis of negotiated wage rates, consider the following
components-of-variancemodel of the expected average wage rate associated
with the

pair-specific variation in wage rates, such as that associated with

In addition, a.

absorbs any variation across pairs associated with the choice of base wage
rates to represent the contract.31
31Most manufacturing contracts cover a wide range of skill levels,
from janitors and unskilled production workers to skilled maintenance
mechanics. The use of a base wage rate to measure the level of wages in a
contract presumes that relative wage differentials within the contract are
held constant. In comparing base wage rates across different contracts,

more highly-skilled group.

discussion.

26
Some preliminary estimates of equation (15) are presented in Table 4
for the two alternative measures of the expected average wage rate
introduced above. Included in the Vector X are variables representing the
state of the labor market at the effective date of the contract (the

known as the Anti-Inflation Board (AIB).

The estimation results are not

particularly strong: the estimated coefficients vary between the two
alternative specifications of expected wage rates, and are mostly
statistically insignificant. The only robust finding is a negative effect
of wage controls on real wage rates.35
In columns (2) and (6), the trend terms and AIB dummy variable are
replaced by an unrestricted set of year-effects for the effective year of
the contract.

This change in specification significantly improves the fit

of the equations, and also reduces the discrepancies between the
alternative wage measures.

In particular, the coefficients of the

provincial unemployment rate and the industry selling price index are
reasonably well-determined and of similar magnitude in the two equations.
Neither the manufacturing wage rate nor industry output have large effects
in either equation.

These simple specifications exclude any information on the evolution of
real wage rates during the previous contract.

The evidence in the micro-

wage determination literature, however, suggests that real wage changes
during the preceding contract exert a major influence on subsequent wage
determination. Both Riddell (1979) and Christofides et. al. (l9BOa, 1980b).
for example,

find that unexpected price increases over the term of the

previous contract lead to incomplete catch-up" increases in the following
contract.

In terms of real wage rates, their results imply that unexpected

real wage reductions during the preceding contract lead to lower real wage
rates in the subsequent one.

A simple way of incorporating this

an instrumental variables scheme is required to obtain consistent

The addition of the

forecast error in the ending wage rate of the previous contract also leads
to larger point estimates of the effect of unemployment on expected real
wage rates.

As in columns (2) and (6), industry output and average wages

in manufacturing continue to have small and statistically insignificant
effects on negotiated wage rates.
While equation (16) permits unexpected real wage changes during the
last contract to affect subsequent real wage rates, it is also possible
that expected wages in the last contract affect future rates.

and duration on negotiated wage rates. The objective is to identify the

concession schedule is a major prediction of the signalling model outlined
in Section I.

More generally,

however, the existence of a trade-off

between wages and contemporaneous strike outcomes is an important
ingredient of many alternative models of strike activity.38
Table S reports a variety of alternative specifications of the effects
of strikes on wages, using the two alternative measures of expected real
wage rates introduced in Tables 3 and 4.

All regressions in the table

include an unrestricted set of year effects for the effective year of the
contract,

as well as the provincial unemployment rate, the real industry

selling price index, the forecast error in the real wage rate at the end of
the preceding contract,

and

a

lagged dependent variable.

The equations are

estimated by two-stage least squares, using lagged year effects, the lagged
national unemployment rate, and the lagged change in consumer prices during
the term of the contract as instrumental variables for the lagged dependent
variable and the forecast error in the ending wage rate of the last

The results are

unsupportive of any systematic relation between wages and strike outcomes.
Neither strike duration nor incidence is significantly related to the
expected average real wage, holding constant the other determinants of
wages.41 The sign of the estimated coefficient of strike duration varies
by the forecasting method for expected future prices, while the estimated
coefficients of the strike incidence variable are both small and positive.
I have also experimented with alternative normalizations of strike

duration, including strike duration as a fraction of average industry
contract

length, and as

contract,

a fraction of the duration of the previous

Neither of these normalizations has any effect on the results.

These estimated correlations must be interpreted very carefully since
they may be biased by unobserved variation in factors that affect both the
negotiated wage rate and the probability and duration of work stoppages.
In particular, in the framework of a signalling model the estimated
correlation of strikes and wages may be positively biased by failure to
control for variation in the alternative wage opportunities of workers.
Unmeasured variation in the expected profitability of the firm, by
comparison,

introduces a negative bias into the estimated correlation of

strikes and wages.

If a signalling model based on unobserved profitability

is correct, however, and the true correlation of wages and strike duration
is negative, then the results in columns (l)-(2) and (5)-(6) suggest that

unobserved variation in alternative wages is the more likely source of

Columns (3)-(4) and (7)-(8) introduce two additional variables to help
control for unobserved variation in alternative wage opportunities.

The

first of these is the actual strike frequency among settlements in the rwo

months prior to the effective month of the current negotiation.43 This
variable controls for any unobservable sources of variation in aggregate
strike probabilities, including changes in aggregate-level alternative wage
opportunities or employment probabilities.

The second variable is an

for wildcat strikes during the term of the previous agreement.44

There is some evidence that intra-contract dispute rates are influenced by
labor market conditions,45 Thus the introduction of an indicator for
wildcat disputes during the last contract helps to control for any
contract-specific variation in local labor market conditions that might
otherwise bias the estimated correlation of wage rates and strike outcomes.
The results in columns (3)-(4) and (7)-(8) suggest that there is indeed
positive correlation between wages and strike duration could also
be generated by changes in the union's assessment of the dispersion of
unobserved profitability. Tracy's (1986, 1987) idea of using the
variability of security price returns could in principle be used to try and
measure changes in the latter, for the subset of publicly traded firms in
the sample.

The estimated coefficients of the indicator for

introduction of these two control variables, however, does not have much
effect on the estimated relation between wage settlements and strike
outcomes.

There is still no evidence of any systematic effect of strike

incidence or duration on negotiated wage rates.
Some further evidence of the effects of strike duration on wages is
summarized in Table 6.

of expected real wages.46

The duration classes correspond roughly to the

quartiles of the distribution of strike lengths in the sample.

Overall,

the results in Table 6 support the conclusion from Table 5 that there is no

strong or systematic relation between wage rates and strikes.

The largest

estimated wage effect is associated with strikes of 45-89 days: strikes in
this category are estimated to increase expected average real wage rates by
.7 percent (with a standard error of .4 percent).

and

of the contract negotiation, wage rates in the previous contract,
measures of unemployment and industry selling prices, there is no

significant correlation between wages and strikes. This conclusion seems
robust to the choice of sample definition.

Although the theoretically-

predicted negative correlation may be obscured by variation in alternative
wages that raises the negotiated wage rate and increases the probability
and duration of disputes,

the attempt to control for this variation using

dispute rates in other recent contracts and a measure of wildcat strikes
during the previous contract was unsuccessful,
The finding that wages are uncorrelated with strike durations differs
sharply from the recent results of McConnell (l987b), who finds that wages
are significantly negatively related to strike durations in a broad sample

of collective bargaining agreements from the U.S.

In contrast,

Lacroix

This accords with the findings of Christofides et. al. (1980a,
1980b), who estimate nominal wage change equations on contracts from the

1964-75 period, and generally fail to find any systematic effect of unemployment

36
(1986) has also reported a negligible correlation between strike oUtcOmes

and wages, using a sample of Canadian contracts derived from the same
source as the sample in this paper.

Lacroix's

results are particularly

interesting because he is also able to reproduce the earlier finding of a
positive correlation between wages and strikes reported by Riddell (1980)
Lacroix shows that this positive correlation is an artifact of the
treatment of time effects in the wage determination model.

Since

McConnell's estimating equations include unrestricted year effects,
however, this cannot explain the discepancy between her results and those
presented here and by Lacroix.
Nevertheless,

in interpreting these results it is important to keep in

mind that the size of the wage strike tradeoff predicted by the theoretical
model is small.

Strike durations are short relative to the period of time

covered by typical labor contracts.

Given this fact, the signalling model

implies a relatively small gap between wages reached with and without a
work stoppage:

on the order of 1 percent.

The estimates in Tables 5 and 6

generally do not rule out such a gap.
IV.

Determinants of Strike Incidence and Duration
This section turns to an investigation

of the determinants of strike

incidence and duration in the contract sample.

According to the model

presented in Section I, the same predetermined variables affect wage rates
and the probability and intensity of strike activity.

Furthermore,

variables that have a positive effect on wages via their effect on the
profitability of the firm should decrease the probability and conditional
duration of work stoppages,

while variables that have a positive effect on

wages via their effect on the alternative wage opportunities of workers

37

should increase the probability and duration of disputes.

Thus a

comparison of the effects of the pre-determined variables in the wage
equations with their effects in the strike incidence and duration equations
provides further evidence on the empirical relevance of the signalling
model of strikes.
Models of Strike Incidence

Table 7 reports estimates of two alternative statistical models of
strike incidence.

The first of these is a first-differencedversion of the

The first two columns of the table report estimates of equation (21)

Columns (3)-(5)

introduce a set of unrestricted year effects. The only one of these
effects that is individually significant is the one for contracts
negotiated in 1966: the sample contains 2 contracts from this year, both of
which resulted in a strike.

indicator

The estimates without year effects suggest that wage and price controls

presented in column (6), while unrestricted year effects are introduced in

subsample.49 They are therefore excluded from the models in columns (8)

These differences are

apparently due to the change in estimation technique:

In summary, the results in Table 7 suggest that strike probabilities
are reduced by higher unemployment and increased by higher industryspecific selling prices.

In addition,

strike probabilities are lower

in

situations where real wages were unexpectedly high at the end of the
preceding contract.

By comparison,

the level of expected real wages in the

previous contract and changes in prices during that contract have
statistically insignificant effects on the probability of a dispute.
Taken together with the results in Section III, these results present
something of a puzzle for the signalling model of strikes.

The estimated

negative effects of unemployment on wage rates and strike probabilities are

On the other hand, there is

Finally,

forecast errors in the ending real wage rate of

the previous contract appear to have positive effects on the duration of
strikes. Again, this finding is difficult to reconcile with their positive
effect on negotiated wages.

V. Conclusions
This paper has presented and tested a simple model of strikes based on
the hypothesis that unions use costly disputes to price discriminate
against more profitable employers. In the absence of direct information on
the demand conditions facing the firm, the union presents the employer with
a downward sloping wage-concession schedule.

Faced with such a schedule,

the firm select higher wages and shorter strikes in more profitable states,
and lower wages and longer strikes in less profitable states.

The model

predicts that wage rates, strike probabilities, and average strike
durations all depend on the same set of variables. These include the mean
and dispersion of unobservable profitability, the expected gap between
productivity inside and outside the firm, and workers' risk preferences.
In common with many other theories of strikes,

the model predicts that

strike incidence and duration will decrease when the joint costs of strikes
increase.

Thus, increases

in expected profitability are predicted to

reduce the probability and duration of work stoppages,
the alternative wage are predicted to increase both.

while increases in
The model also

predicts that wages will rise with increases in the alternative wage, and
rise with increases

in the expected profitability of the firm.

46
The implications of the theory are tested on a sample of collective
bargaining agreements from the Canadian manufacturing sector.

A simple

model of contractual wage rates is developed, based on the expected average
real wage rate during the term of the agreement.

Negotiated wage rates are

found to depend on the regional unemployment rate, the industry-specific
selling price, and the level and unexpected change in real wage rates in
the previous agreement.
however,

Contrary to the basic premise of the model,

there is no evidence that wage rates vary systematically with the

duration or incidence of strikes.
Simple statistical models are also developed for the probability and
conditional duration of strikes.

As predicted by the theory, increases

in

unemployment, which are interpreted as reductions in the alternative wage,
decrease the negotiated wage and decrease the probability of strikes.

In

contrast, the estimated effects of industry selling prices are inconsistent
with the theoretical model.

Increases

in selling prices are found to

increase the negotiated wage, and also increase the probability of
disputes.

The latter finding seems to contradict the prediction that

strike losses will be lower when the opportunity costs of strike activity
are higher.

There is some evidence that expected strike duration

is

Again, however, this effect is

difficult to reconcile with the predictions of the model, since neither
wages nor strike probabilities are correlated with industry output.
On balance,

strike activity is weak. Neither the predicted structural relation between
wages and strikes, nor the predicted reduced form relation for wages,
strike probabilities, and strike durations

is found in the data.

bargaining units separately for some contract negotiations, and jointly for
ocher negoriationa. In these cases I merged together the related oonroscrs
in all years to form a single chronology for the multiple-employer
bargaining unit.

Finally,

there are some cases where the Wage Tape

reasons.

In these cases I concatenated the contract chronologies to form e

continuous chronology.

Continuity of Base Wage Rates
In some cases the base wage rate definition changes between

consecutive contracts on the Wage Tape (for example, between

in one contract and "assemblers" in the next)

janitors and

The cooing wage

rate for each contract was checked against the wage reported in the next
contract as the "old rate".

In cases where a change of definition

occurred, the base wage series were index-linked to form a consistent wage
series.
