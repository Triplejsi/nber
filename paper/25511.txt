Is Inflation Just Around the Corner? The Phillips Curve and Global Inflationary Pressures
Olivier Coibion, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, and Mauricio Ulate
NBER Working Paper No. 25511
January 2019
JEL No. E24,E31
ABSTRACT
The length of the recovery since the Great Recession and the low reported levels of the
unemployment rate in the U.S. are increasingly generating concerns about inflationary pressures.
We document that an expectations-augmented Phillips curve can account for inflation not just in
the U.S. but across a range of countries, once household or firm-level inflation expectations are
used. Given this relationship, we can infer the dynamics of slack from the dynamics of inflation
gaps and vice versa. We find that the implied slack was pushing inflation below expectations in
the years after the Great Recession but the global and U.S. inflation gaps have shrunk in recent
years thus suggesting tighter economic conditions. While we find no evidence that inflation is on
the brink of rising, the sustained deflationary pressures following the Great Recession have
abated.

[ Insert Figure 3 Here ]
The U.S. and global inflation gap display
qualitatively similar dynamics. Both were
steady around zero through much of the 2000s
but fell with the onset of the Great Recession,
consistent with global declines in economic
activity at the time. These gaps experienced
further declines from 2011 to 2014 as
economic weakness remained pronounced or
increased further depending on the country.
Since then however, both the U.S. and global
inflation gap have been shrinking. By mid
2018, we estimate a global inflation gap of
approximately -0.3% below the average levels
from the 2000s, implying that unemployment
remains above natural rates of unemployment
globally. To get a sense of the implied
magnitude of the unemployment gap, we use
the estimated slope of the Phillips curve shown
in Figure 2. This yields an estimate of the
implied unemployment gap of approximately
one percentage point, although there remains

pressures. We document that an expectationsaugmented Phillips curve can account for
inflation not just in the U.S. but across a range
of countries, once household or firm-level
inflation expectations are used. Given this
relationship, we can infer the dynamics of slack
from the dynamics of inflation gaps and vice
versa. We find that the implied slack was

Notes: Data for the Eurozone, France, Germany, and Denmark are taken from Arioli et al. (2018). The time series of inflation expectations for
Italy is adjusted for the fact that in the early part of the survey firms were provided with recent inflation expectations which strongly influences
inflation expectations (see. Coibion et al. 2018 for more details). In the later part of the survey, a subset of firms is not provided with recent
inflation. We find that inflation gap for firms that are not provided with recent inflation is 1.8 times larger than inflation gap for firms that are
provided with recent inflation. Hence, we multiply the time series of the inflation gap by 1.8.

inflation expectations of households or firms, 𝑢 is unemployment rate, 𝑢∗ is non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment rate (NAIRU) provided by the OECD.
