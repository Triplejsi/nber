Parental Beliefs about Returns to Different Types of Investments in School Children

JEL No. I24,I26,J13,J24,J62
ABSTRACT
Parental investments as well as school quality are important determinants of children’s later-life
outcomes. In this paper, we shed light on what determines parental investments and study how
parents perceive the returns to parental time investments, material investments and school quality,
as well as the complementarity/substitutability between the different inputs. Using a
representative sample of 1,962 parents in England, we document that parents perceive the returns
to 3 hours of weekly parental time investments or £30 of weekly material investments to matter
more than moving a child to a better school. Parents perceive the returns to time and material
investments to be diminishing and perceive material investments as more productive if children
attend higher quality schools. Perceived returns do not differ with the child’s initial human capital
or gender and, surprisingly, we find no differences in perceived returns by the parents’
socioeconomic background. Consistent with parental beliefs playing an important role in parental
investment decisions, perceived returns are found to be highly correlated with actual investment
decisions.

Introduction

There are many ways in which parents can provide a stimulating educational environment for their
children. Parents can devote attention to their children by spending time with them. They can also
invest money by, for instance, purchasing educational games/toys or hiring a private tutor. Moreover,
parents can choose to send their children to private schools or can move to a better neighborhood where
schools are of higher quality. While it has been well documented that these parental investments are
highly predictive of important life outcomes such as educational attainment, earnings and health, it
has also been established that the time and financial resources, which parents allocate towards their
children, varies considerably across different families (e.g. Cooksey and Fondell 1996; Guryan, Hurst
and Kearney 2008; Lareau 2011; Attanasio et al. 2013; Carneiro, Meghir and Parey 2013; Putnam
2015). This raises the question of what drives those differences in parental investment decisions.
To understand why some parents invest more into their children than others, it is imperative to
understand how parents think about the returns to investments. While differences in available resources
might explain some of the variation in investments, parental beliefs about the returns to investments
are likely to play a crucial role in parents’ educational investment decisions. In order to get to the
source of differential investments, it is therefore essential to shed more light on how parents differ in
their beliefs about the returns to different types of investments and how their beliefs are related to
actual investment choices. While estimating the actual returns to different investments is important
for understanding which parental investments matter, shedding more light on how parents perceive the
returns to investments is crucial for our understanding of how parental investments respond to policy
changes. With this aim in mind, we collect and describe a novel representative dataset on parental
beliefs about the productivity and usefulness of their investments.
We make several contributions to the literature. First, we document how parents perceive the
returns to different types of educational investments made in school children (i.e. time investments,
material investments and school quality) using a large nationally representative sample of parents with
school-age children. Second, given that the returns to different activities might not be independent, we
investigate how parents perceive the complementarity/substitutability between the different types of
investments. In analyzing our data, we pay particular attention to studying the extent to which beliefs
about returns are heterogeneous in different dimensions. Finally, we investigate whether differences in
perceived returns are predictive of actual investment decisions made by parents.
Observed educational choices are consistent with many different alternative specifications of preferences

2

and beliefs, which is why it is not possible to investigate the role of beliefs in educational investment
decisions using choice data alone (Manski 2004). For this reason, we conduct a novel representative
survey and elicit parental beliefs directly using hypothetical investment scenarios. The approach we
use is related to the elicitation of information on subjective expectations about certain events. When
applied to future earnings this approach was pioneered by Dominitz and Manski (1996) and it has been
successfully used in a growing number of studies (e.g. Jensen 2010; Attanasio and Kaufmann 2014;
Kaufmann 2014).1 In a recent study, Cunha, Elo and Culhane (2013) make an important contribution
to the literature by developing a methodology for eliciting parental beliefs about the returns to parental
investments using hypothetical scenarios. In a sample of parents with low socioeconomic status, they
document beliefs about the returns to parental investments made in children aged 0-2. In this paper, we
build on Cunha, Elo and Culhane (2013) and investigate how parents perceive the returns to different
types of parental investments made in school children. By constructing hypothetical scenarios we can
vary one educational input at a time while keeping other factors constant, which allows us to elicit
individual perceived returns to different types of investments as well as their interactions.
To elicit parental beliefs about the properties of the process of skill formation and to collect
information on parents’ actual investment decisions, we administer a survey to a representative sample
of 1,962 parents living in England. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to elicit parental
beliefs about the returns to parental investments in a nationally representative sample. To be eligible
to participate in the study, parents had to have at least one child aged 5-16 years living with them in
their home. The sample was selected to be representative of the English population of interest in terms
of region, gender and education level of the responding parent, as well as the age and gender of the
respondent’s child. To elicit parental beliefs about the productivity of different types of investments
made in school children, we present all parents with hypothetical investment scenarios which vary
along three dimensions: (i) the level of parental time investments, (ii) the level of parental material
investments, and (iii) the quality of the school the child currently attends. For each scenario, parents
are asked to state what the future earnings of the child will be at age 30. This research design allows
us to investigate how parents perceive the returns to these three different inputs and it allows us to
examine whether parents perceive the different inputs as substitutes or complements. Mapping the
scenarios considered into expected returns hence allows us to characterize parental perceptions of the
process of skill formation and of the role played by different inputs. By asking about hypothetical

families rather than the respondents’ own family we can vary inputs across scenarios and abstract
from individual (unobserved) differences across respondents. In addition, we also investigate whether
perceived returns are diminishing, and whether the perceived returns differ with the characteristics of
the child. For this purpose, we randomize parents into different groups that vary along four different
dimensions: (i) the initial level of time and money invested, (ii) the initial skill level of the child in the
scenario, (iii) the gender of the child, and (iv) the age at which the educational investments are made.
Some clear results emerge from our study. While parents think that school quality matters, they
also think that parental home inputs play a very important role. In fact, they believe that an additional
3 hours per week in terms of time investments or an additional £30 per week in terms of material
investments matter more than moving a child from a school which ‘Requires Improvement’ to a school
that is ‘Outstanding’. The average perceived return to this change in school quality is 10% in terms of
earnings at age 30, while the average perceived return to 3 additional hours of weekly time investments
is 21%, and the average perceived return to £30 additional weekly material investments is 15%. All
these perceived average returns are significantly different from each other. Moreover, we find that there
is a perceived complementarity between home and school inputs, i.e. parents perceive the returns to
material resources at home to be higher if the children also attend better schools. We further document
that parents perceive the productivity of time and material inputs to be diminishing, i.e. the returns
per hour/£ invested decrease with an additional hour/£ invested. We find no significant differences
in perceived returns to school, time or material investments by the initial skill level or the gender of
the child in the scenario. This suggests that parents believe that children of low and high ability, as
well as boys and girls respond similarly to each type of investment. We further document that parents
believe that the returns to school quality are higher for older children.
Turning to the question how perceived returns vary across respondents, we document a substantial
amount of heterogeneity in perceived returns. We find that perceived returns to the different types
of investments correlate strongly. Those parents who perceive the returns to school quality to be
high are also more likely to perceive high returns to parental time and material investments. Perhaps
surprisingly, we do not find detectable systematic differences in perceived returns by socioeconomic
background or income variables in this nationally representative sample of parents. This evidence
contrasts with some of the discussions in the literature, for instance with the hypotheses proposed by
Lareau (2011) or with the findings in Boneva and Rauh (2018).
Importantly, we find that perceived returns are correlated with actual reported investment decisions.

Parents who perceive the returns to time investments to be higher spend more time interacting with
their children, parents who perceive the returns to material investments to be higher spend more
money on learning resources, and parents who perceive the returns to school quality to be higher
spend significantly more money on school fees. While we do not provide direct evidence for a causal
link between beliefs and investments, our descriptive results are consistent with parental beliefs playing
an important role in parental investment decisions.
Given that parental beliefs to the different types of investments correlate strongly, a natural question
which arises is why some parents perceive all types of investments as very important while other parents
do not. While we are not be able to provide an ultimate answer to the question of how beliefs about
returns are formed, we note that one underlying reason for why some parents may perceive all returns
as higher is that those parents believe that children’s skills are more malleable in general and more
responsive to any type of input. Using a supplementary parental mindset questionnaire, which builds
on the work by Dweck (2006), we find evidence that is consistent with this interpretation. These
results are important as previous studies have shown that individual investments are responsive to
interventions which alter individual beliefs regarding the malleability of skills (see, e.g., Alan, Boneva
and Ertac 2015).
Our study relates to several different strands of the literature. First, it relates to the literature on
investments made by parents in their children which was pioneered by Becker and Tomes (1979, 1986).
While traditionally this literature has assumed that parents are endowed with perfect information
regarding the production function, recent studies have relaxed this assumption and have drawn attention
to the role of parental beliefs. For example, Kinsler and Pavan (2016) and Dizon-Ross (2018) investigate
how parental beliefs evolve and how parents tailor educational investments according to their (inaccurate)
beliefs about their children’s ability, while Caucutt, Lochner and Park (2017) provide a theoretical
framework in which they explore how information-based frictions can lead to inefficiently low investments.
In contrast to these studies, we do not consider parental beliefs about their children’s ability but about
the returns to parental investments. Our study most closely relates to Cunha, Elo and Culhane (2013)
and Cunha (2014) who use hypothetical scenarios to elicit maternal beliefs about the productivity of
investments made in children aged 0-2. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to document
parental beliefs about the returns to different types of educational investments made in school children
and to show that these beliefs are significantly related to actual investment choices.

5

The present study complements recent work by Boneva and Rauh (2018).2 There are several
important differences between this study and Boneva and Rauh (2018). First, the present study
uses data from a representative sample of parents in England. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first attempt to measure parental beliefs in a large representative sample of the population.
Second, and more importantly, Boneva and Rauh (2018) only focus on the perceived returns to parental
time investments while this study investigates how parents perceive the returns to three different
types of investments made by parents, namely parental time and material investments as well as
school quality. This allows us to investigate how parents perceive the complementarity/substitutability
between different inputs. To gain a better understanding of how parents react to policy changes (e.g.
an increase school quality), it is important for us to know how parents perceive the interaction between
different inputs.
Second, our study relates to the literature which examines the importance of individual beliefs
about returns to educational investment decisions made by students (e.g., Dominitz and Manski 1996,
Jensen 2010, Abramitzky and Lavy 2014, Attanasio and Kaufmann 2014, Kaufmann 2014, Almas et al.
2016, Attanasio and Kaufmann 2017, Boneva and Rauh 2017, Belfield et al. forthcoming). It is also
related to how students’ beliefs about returns are related to students’ choice of major (Montmarquette,
Cannings and Mahseredjian 2002; Arcidiacono 2004; Arcidiacono, Hotz and Kang 2012; Beffy, Fougere
and Maurel 2012; Zafar 2013; Arcidiacono et al. 2014; Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner 2014; Wiswall
and Zafar 2015a,b; Hastings et al. 2016; Wiswall and Zafar 2017; Baker et al. 2017), high-school track
(Giustinelli 2016), and which specific university to attend (Delavande and Zafar 2014). Relative to
these studies we focus on the beliefs of parents and how these beliefs are related to the educational
choices they make for their children.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 presents a stylized model of the production
technology that highlights the importance of parental beliefs in parents’ educational investment decisions
and motivates our survey design. Section 3 presents the survey design that we use to elicit parental
beliefs about the characteristics of the production technology, and provides details on the characteristics
of the sample. Section 4 presents the results, while Section 5 concludes.
2 It

is also related to recent work by Biroli et al. (2018) who investigate parental beliefs about returns to health
investments as well as to Lergetporer, Werner and Woessmann (2018) who examine beliefs about the returns to university
education in a representative sample of adults in Germany.

Theoretical Framework

In this section, we present a stylized model to highlight how parental beliefs about the process of
development and the returns to investment are likely to be critical for parents’ investment decisions.
More specifically, we present a simple conceptual framework that describes parents’ investment decisions
as a result of an optimization problem. In our framework, parents care about the development of their
child as well as their own consumption and leisure, and they face a time and a budget constraint as
well as a perceived production technology that maps educational investments made by parents into
future child outcomes. The technology of skill formation is based on the general skill accumulation
framework developed in Cunha, Heckman and Schennach (2010).3 However, rather than assuming
that the parents know the actual process of skill formation, we assume that they have some beliefs
about it, which might be different from the actual process.
We assume that parents care about their own consumption Ci , the use of their time, and their
children’s adult outcomes yi , such as their earnings and, more generally, well-being. The parents of
child i can allocate their total available time T to activities that help child i accumulate skills, IiT ,
leisure activities that do not directly promote the child’s human capital, which we henceforth refer
to as ‘own’ leisure time, Loi , as well as work, Lw
i . Let the hourly wage be denoted as wi . Parents
can spend their total income, wi Lw
i , on own consumption, Ci , monetary investments that help their
children acquire skills, IiM , as well as expenses related to the quality of the school their child attends,
IiS . While there are many schools in the UK that do not charge school fees, we can think of school
expenditures in this context as any additional expenses the parents have to incur for their child to
attend a better school (e.g. higher rents in neighborhoods with good schools). We also assume that
parents might enjoy (or not) spending ‘investment’ time with their children.
We assume that parents perceive child outcomes to depend on the child’s characteristics Zi , such
as the child’s stock of skills at the beginning of the period considered or the child’s gender, and on
three types of investment: time investment, IiT , material investment, IiM , and the quality of the school
the child attends, IiS , according to the function f as in
yi = f (Zi , IiT , IiM , IiS , i ),

(1)

where i denotes some random shocks.
3 For the purpose of our analysis, we simplify the framework presented in Cunha, Heckman and Schennach (2010) in
several ways, e.g. we do not distinguish between cognitive and non-cognitive skills.

7

f is assumed to be monotonically increasing, twice continuously differentiable and concave in IiT ,
IiM and IiS . We stress that the function f , which represents one of the relevant constraints parents face
in choosing how to allocate time and financial resources, does not necessarily coincide with the true
production function of skills. Parents might have beliefs about the production process that might be
distorted. The process of skill formation is complex, it may well be that parents do not have complete
or accurate information about how the different inputs map into child outcomes.
We also note that unlike other studies, which elicit the returns to investments on skills (e.g. Cunha,
Elo and Culhane 2013) or the returns to skills on the labor market (e.g. Jensen 2010, Attanasio and
Kaufmann 2014, Kaufmann 2014) we directly elicit parental beliefs about the returns to investments
on labor market outcomes. These beliefs will be a combination of parental beliefs about the process
that produces skills but also their beliefs about the returns to these skills on the labor market. We
assume that parents care about children’s outcomes, rather than children’s skills, which is why we
directly elicit the returns to investments on future outcomes.
In addition to the constraint that describes the perceived process that generates child outcomes in
equation (1), parents face a time constraint:

IiT + Loi + Lw
i = T,

(2)

Ci + pM IiM + pS IiS = wi LW
i ,

(3)

and a budget constraint:

where the price of own consumption is normalized to 1 and pM and pS are the relative prices of monetary
investments and school quality respectively, and where we are neglecting savings for expositional
simplicity.
If one considers the optimization problem faced by parents, which involves a utility function that
depends on yi , Ci and possibly IiT and the three constraints in equations (1), (2) and (3), it is clear that
parents’ investment decisions will depend on: (i) how much they care about their children; (ii) their
financial and time resources; and (iii) their perceptions about the process that generates children’s
outcomes. In particular, from the parents’ optimization problem it is apparent that the perceived
partial derivatives of the production technology are critical for parents’ investment decisions:
∂f (·) ∂f (·) ∂f (·)
,
,
.
∂IiT
∂IiM
∂IiS

8

(4)

Moreover, we also note that the perceived marginal returns to any given input may depend on the level
of the other inputs. For example, it may well be that time investments are perceived as more or less
productive if they are complemented with high monetary investments. It is therefore crucial to also
investigate how parents perceive the complementarity/substitutability between the different inputs:
∂f (·)
∂f (·)
S0
S0
∂IiT ∂IiM
∂IiT ∂IiS

∂f (·)
S0.
∂IiM ∂IiS

(5)

In addition, it is also of interest whether parents perceive the returns to the different types of
investments to differ with the baseline characteristics of the child, e.g. it may be that parents perceive
the returns to differ with the initial human capital of the child.
The features of the true process of skill formation can be estimated from actual data (subject to a
number of identification problems that arise from the possible endogeneity of investment choices, see
the discussion in Attanasio et al. 2015 and Attanasio, Meghir and Nix 2015). However, investment
decisions might not be informed by the features of such processes but by individual perceptions.
Without additional information such as the one we elicit, it is not possible to identify the role of
parental beliefs from information on parental investments, as beliefs cannot be separated from other
factors, such as taste.4
While the literature has recognized the importance of parental beliefs in parental investment
decisions, not much is known about how parents perceive the returns to different types of investments
and how they perceive the complementarity/substitutability between different inputs. We use a novel
survey design to elicit these beliefs, which allows us to gain deeper insights into how parents perceive
the technology which maps educational inputs into future child outcomes.

Eliciting Parental Beliefs

To elicit parental beliefs about the properties of the production technology and to collect information
on parents’ actual investment decisions, we administer a survey to a representative sample of almost
2,000 parents living in England. As motivated by the theoretical framework, parental beliefs about
several partial and cross derivatives of the production technology are likely to be critical for the level
and composition of educational investments made by parents. We build on Cunha, Elo and Culhane
(2013) and use hypothetical investment scenarios to elicit parental beliefs about the characteristics of
4 Attanasio, Cunha and Jervis (2016) show how to identify parental taste within a structural model using information
on investment and subjective beliefs.

the production technology.5 By constructing hypothetical scenarios we can vary one input at a time
while keeping other factors constant, which allows us to elicit individual perceived returns to different
educational inputs.
Hypothetical Scenarios:

We present all parents with eight different hypothetical scenarios

that vary along three key dimensions: (i) the level of parental time investments, I T , (ii) the level of
parental material investments, I M , and (iii) the quality of the school the child attends, I S . For each of
these eight scenarios, we ask parents to state what they believe the earnings of the child in the scenario
will be at age 30. By comparing parents’ responses across the different scenarios, we can infer parents’
beliefs about the returns to the different types of investments, as well as parental beliefs about the
complementarity/substitutability of the different inputs. Our questions allow us to get an estimate of
individual expected returns.6
More specifically, we ask parents to imagine two hypothetical average British families (the “Jones”
and the “Smiths”). In both hypothetical families, there is one child who is currently in school. Parents
are told that while the Jones and the Smiths live in the same neighbourhood and are identical in
many different respects (e.g., in terms of parental income and education, as well as the intellectual
ability of the child), there is one difference between the two families. In particular, they are told that
the child of the Jones attends a high quality school that has been rated as ‘Outstanding’, while the
child of the Smiths attends a low quality school that has been rated as ‘Requires Improvement’.7 We
deliberately made it explicit that the two hypothetical families are otherwise identical, as this allows
us to abstract from other potential differences between the families. Different respondents might have
different beliefs about the returns to parental investment, an important dimension of heterogeneity
which is at the center of this study.
For each of these two hypothetical families, parents are then presented with four different investment
scenarios that vary in the levels of parental time investments, I T , and the level of parental material
investments, I M . Put together, the four different investment scenarios are (1) low time investments/low
material investments, (2) low time investments/high material investments, (3) high time investments/low
5 Cunha, Elo and Culhane (2013) do not elicit parental beliefs about the returns to different types of investments.
Another important difference between the two studies is that while we elicit parental beliefs about how parental
investments made during a child’s school life map into later-life outcomes, Cunha, Elo and Culhane (2013) elicit parental
beliefs about how parental investments in very early childhood (i.e. age 0-2) map into increased skill levels at age 2.
6 Given that we did not want to burden respondents with a very long questionnaire, we did not elicit information
about individual uncertainty about human capital investment returns.
7 In England, schools are regularly inspected by Ofsted, a non-ministerial department of the UK government. A school
can obtain one of the following ratings: ‘Outstanding’, ‘Good’, ‘Satisfactory/Requires Improvement’, ‘Inadequate’. In
2017, 21% of all schools in England are rated as ‘Outstanding’, 68% as ‘Good’, 9% as ‘Requires improvement’, and 2%
as ‘Inadequate’.

material investments, and (4) high time investments/high material investments. Parents saw all four
scenarios for each hypothetical family simultaneously on one screen, i.e. they could compare across
the four scenarios while responding to the questions. The order of the four scenarios on the screen
was randomized across respondents. We highlighted the differences across scenarios by underlining
the aspects we varied (see Appendix B). In total, each parent is thus presented with eight different
scenarios, which are illustrated in Table 1. For each of these eight scenarios j, parents are asked to
state what they expect the earnings of the hypothetical child to be at age 30 (ỹj ). We ask parents
about the likely future earnings of the child, instead of asking about some interim test result, because
this allows us to calculate expected returns without having to rely on assumptions about the returns
of arbitrarily scaled test scores.
Interpreting this approach through the lenses of a production function that relates different inputs
to outcomes, we see that the way our questions are constructed map eight different points of a threedimension space (time, material and school quality) into possible outcomes. We can therefore estimates
the returns to specific investments over the variations considered by the different scenarios. We cannot
measure individual beliefs about the returns to investments outside the scenarios considered without
some arbitrary extrapolation.
By asking quantitative questions we avoid the pitfalls of interpreting value judgements such as “very
important” on a Likert scale. While the questions were not straightforward to answer, we note that
randomness in responses would increase measurement error, and therefore would make it less likely
for us to find significant returns and meaningful differences across scenarios, as well as significant
correlations between beliefs and actual investments. We are aware of the presence of measurement
error, which inspires us to reduce the problem by taking the average, when meaningful, of different
measures. We purposely also did not provide any information about average earnings in order not to
prime respondents.8
We can use the parents’ responses to the eight different scenarios to infer how parents perceive
the returns to the three different educational inputs (i.e. the partial derivatives in (4)) by comparing
parents’ responses in scenarios in which a specific educational investment is low to the corresponding
scenario in which the educational investment is high. In addition, the survey design allows us to
document how parents perceive the complementarity/substitutability between the different inputs (i.e.
the cross derivatives in (5)). For example, by comparing the perceived return to time investments
8 A similar methodology has also been successfully used in Boneva and Rauh (2018) who focus exclusively on beliefs
about the returns to time investments.

when school quality is high to the perceived return to time investments when school quality is low,
we can learn something about the perceived complementarity/substitutability between parental time
investments and school quality.

While each parent is presented with these eight different scenarios, we additionally randomize
parents into different groups that vary along four different dimensions: (i) the initial level of time and
money invested, (ii) the initial skill level of the child in the scenario, (iii) the gender of the child, and
(iv) the age at which investments are made. We describe each of these four randomizations in turn
and summarize the key facts in Table 2.
Randomization 1 - Initial Level: While all parents see the eight scenarios presented in Table 1,
we vary the amount of time and money which is associated with low and high levels of time and
material investments between parents. Respondents are randomized into two different groups. For
the first group (‘Group 0’), a low (high) level of time investment refers to spending 0 hours (3 hours)
every week helping the child acquire new skills, while a low (high) level of material investment refers
to spending £0 (£30) every week on educational resources which help the child acquire new skills.
For the second group (‘Group 1’), a low (high) level of time investment refers to spending 1 hour (4
hours) every week helping the child acquire new skills, while a low (high) level of material investment
refers to spending £10 (£40) every week on educational resources which help the child acquire new
skills. This research design allows us to investigate whether parents perceive the returns to parental
time and material investments to be diminishing.

Randomization 2 - Initial Skill: To investigate whether parental beliefs differ with the initial
skill level of the child, we also randomize the skill levels of the two children in the hypothetical families
across respondents. One group of parents is presented with two children whose initial skills are low,
while the other group of parents is presented with two children whose initial skills are high. More
specifically, the children with low initial skill levels are described as not having achieved the expected
level on the most recent key stage examination, which is a national standardized test all children in
England need to take, while children with high initial skill levels are described as having achieved the
expected level. If the parent is presented with a child in Year 3 then the key stage examination which
is being referred to is the Key Stage 1 examination, which is taken in Year 2. If the parent is presented
with a child in Year 7 then the key stage examination which is being referred to in the scenario is the
Key Stage 2 examination, which is taken in Year 6.9
Randomization 3 - Gender: To investigate whether parental beliefs about the characteristics of
the production function differ by the gender of the child, we randomize the gender of the hypothetical
9 In 2016, the percentage of students in England achieving the expected levels in the Key Stage 1 examination is 74%,
65% and 73% in reading, writing and mathematics, respectively. The percentage of students achieving the expected
levels in the Key Stage 2 examination is 66%, 74%, 73% and 70% in reading, writing, grammar/spelling/punctuation,
and mathematics, respectively.

child in the scenario across parents. While one group of parents is presented with scenarios in which
the children are boys (‘John’ and ‘Simon’), the other group is presented with scenarios in which the
children are girls (‘Jane’ and ‘Sarah’). Not only does this design allow us to establish whether parents
perceive the potential earnings of girls to be different from those of boys, but we can also investigate
whether parents perceive the productivity of investments to differ by gender.
Randomization 4 - Age: Finally, we randomize the age at which investments are made across
respondents. While one group is presented with scenarios in which the hypothetical children are in
Year 3 of primary school, the other group is presented with scenarios in which the hypothetical children
are in Year 7 of secondary school. The school years during which investments are made for the first
group of respondents are school years 3-6, while the school years during which investments are made
for the second group are school years 7-10.

Summary Statistics

All data was collected by a professional survey company in Oct-Nov 2016. All participating parents
were part of the company’s online panel and participated in the survey online. Parents received modest
incentives for completing the survey in the form of points that they could collect and later exchange for
small gifts. To be eligible to participate in the survey, parents had to have at least one child aged 5-16
years living with them in their home. If the parent had more than one child, they were asked about
one randomly selected child (henceforth referred to as the ‘target’ child). The sample was selected
to be representative in terms of region in England, the gender and education level of the responding
parent, as well as the age and gender of the respondent’s child. The survey company used quota-based
sampling when contacting parents to participate. To correct for any imbalances in response rates, we
re-weight the sample using survey weights when performing the analyses.
The sample consists of 1,962 parents who completed the survey and the characteristics are reported
in Table 3.10 In terms of parental characteristics, 50% of the parents in the sample are male with the
average parent being 42 years old. Parents have on average 1.5 children in their household. 58% and
17% work full-time and part-time respectively, and 13% of respondents are single parents. 45% of
responding parents have a university degree, and in 55% of cases, at least one of the child’s parents
has a degree. The mean annual household income is £44,890.
10 We drop observations where the target child is home-schooled or boards at a school. This removed 55 observations.
Participating parents could skip questions they did not wish to answer which resulted in some missing values for some
of the collected variables.

14

We use data from the Family Resources Survey (FRS) 2013-2014 to compare our sample statistics
to the statistics of a representative sample of parents with 5-16 year old children in England. The
average annual household income in the representative sample is £44,296, which is very similar to the
average household income of £44,890 we report in our sample. Figure C.1 in the Appendix depicts the
distribution of household incomes both in our sample as well as in the Family Resources Survey. We
also find similar employment statistics in both samples. In the FRS, 53% of parents work full-time,
while 21% work part-time. In terms of education, we find that the parents in our sample are somewhat
better educated than the parents in the FRS. More specifically, we find that in the FRS 31% of parents
have a university degree, while 42% of households have at least one parent with a university degree.
To make our sample comparable to the nationally representative sample, we use inverse probability
weights in the analysis in order to re-weigh the observations to account for the differences in education
levels. We note that our results are not materially affected by the use of these survey weights.
In terms of characteristics of the target child, for whom the parents completed the survey, 50% are
male, and the average child is 10 years old and in Year 6 at school. Table A.1 shows the distribution of
Ofsted ratings for the school of the selected child. 85% of children in the sample attend either a Good
or an Outstanding school. Ofsted data for the 2016-17 academic year shows that 89% of all schools in
England are rated as either Good or Outstanding. Sample characteristics are well balanced over the
sixteen groups into which respondents were randomly allocated.

Note: Individual parent characteristics refer to those of the responding
parent. ‘Foreign language at home’ denotes whether the parent speaks any
language other than English at home. Household income refers to the total
gross income obtained from all sources over the last 12 months, summed
over all members of the household.

Parental Investments: In order to determine whether parental beliefs about the returns to
15

investments can be used to predict actual investments in their own children, we also ask parents about
the investments they currently make in their child. Tables A.2 and A.3 in the Appendix provide
summary statistics for the responses to the own investment questions. Parents are asked about both
time and material investments. For time investments, we ask how much time they spend on weekdays
and weekends on activities with their child such as reading, conversing, playing and helping with school
work. For material investments, respondents are asked to report their average monthly spending on
various educational categories, namely books, educational games/toys, societies, private tuition and
school fees.
As shown in Table A.2, parents spend on average more time per day with their children during
the weekend than on weekdays. In both cases, conversing with their child is the most time-consuming
activity with the average parent spending almost 80 minutes and close to two hours per day talking
with their child during weekdays and weekends respectively. Across all activities, parents spend on
average almost 25 hours per week with their children. Table A.3 provides summary statistics on
material investments. The average parent spends £150 per month on such investments, of which £110
are spent on school fees and societies. The order of the different survey blocks was randomized across
respondents.

Results
Characterising Subjective Beliefs Data

To get a better understanding of how parents perceive the properties of the process of skill formation,
we estimate an ordinary least squares regression relating child outcomes to different input scenarios,
allowing for interactions between different inputs. More specifically, we estimate variants of the
following empirical specification:

log ỹji = α + β1 IjT + β2 IjM + β3 IjS + β4 IjT × IjM + β5 IjT × IjS + β6 IjM × IjS + γi + ji ,

(6)

where j indicates the scenario, ỹji are the earnings parent i expects in scenario j, α is the intercept,
IjT is a dummy variable which equals 1 if parental time investments are high (in scenario j), IjM is a
dummy variable which equals 1 if parental material investments are high, IjS is a dummy variable which
indicates whether school quality is high, and γi are parent fixed effects. As motivated in Section 2,
we are interested in the perceived returns to the different educational inputs. These perceived returns
16

will be captured by the estimates of β1 , β2 and β3 . In addition, if parents perceive the different inputs
as complements (substitutes), we expect the coefficients on the interaction terms (i.e. β4 , β5 and β6 )
to be positive (negative).
As mentioned in the previous section, we additionally randomize respondents into different groups
which vary along four different dimensions: (i) the initial level of time and money invested, (ii) the
initial skill level, (iii) the gender and (iv) the age of the child. We investigate whether the main
results differ along any of these four dimensions by splitting the sample and performing the analyses
on the different subgroups. This approach allows us to study features such as the curvature of the
process relating inputs to child outcomes and the role of initial conditions and interactions. For
instance, equation (6) assumes that increasing investment (in time or material) will have the same
effect on child outcomes independently of the starting point. Estimating the equation allowing different
coefficients depending on whether the time investment started from 0 or 1 hours (or whether the
material investment started from £0 or £10) relaxes this assumption.

4.2

Parental Beliefs about the Production Technology

Figure 1 shows the expected earnings for the eight hypothetical scenarios averaged across all respondents.11
Expected earnings are increasing in all three investment types, namely school quality, time and material
investments. The average expected earnings for a child who attends a high quality school are £27,543
for low-time and low-material investments, £32,747 for low-time and high-material investments, £33,807
for high-time and low-material investments, and £40,083 for high-time and high-material investments.
When the quality of the school the child in the scenario attends is low, the average expected earnings are
£24,974 for low-time and low-material investments, £29,021 for low-time and high-material investments,
£30,382 for high-time and low-material investments, and £35,450 for high-time and high-material
investments. The average across these eight scenarios is £31,751.
There are several patterns worth noting. First, parents seem to give meaningful responses in the
sense that higher levels of investments are also associated with higher levels of expected earnings.
Second, parents are on average remarkably close in their estimates to the true average. Using the
Family Resource Survey of 2013-14, we find the average annual earnings of women and men working
at least 30 hours who are 25-34 years old to be 25,630 and 30,977, respectively. It is also noteworthy
that in both panels, average expected earnings are higher for high-time and low-material investments
11 To ensure that our results are not driven by outliers, we set the responses of those individuals to missing for whom
the implied returns to school, time or material investments are in the top or bottom 1% of the returns distribution.

(bar 3) relative to low-time and high-material investments (bar 2), thereby suggesting that parents
perceive the returns to 3 additional hours of weekly time investments to be higher than the returns to
a rise of £30 in weekly material investments.
Table 4 shows the results from regressing log expected earnings of the child in scenario j as reported
by parent i on indicator variables for high school quality (I S ), high levels of time investments (I T )
and high levels of material investments (I M ). In this analysis, we pool all respondents irrespective of
which group they were randomized into (see Table 2), so the results average across respondents who
have seen different initial levels of investments and children with different skills at baseline, gender
and age.
We begin by running the model without respondent fixed effects (Column 1). We then subsequently
add in respondent fixed effects (Column 2) and, in order to examine whether there is perceived
substitutability/complementarity between investment types, interaction terms between the indicator

Notes: Standard errors in parentheses. * p<0.10, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01.
Standard errors are clustered at the parent level. Observations are weighted
according to the age and gender of the parent’s own child and the education
level of the responding parent. Regressions are performed using the responses
to all eight hypothetical investment scenarios. The dependent variable is
the perceived log earnings of the hypothetical child at age 30. ‘High school
quality’ is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the hypothetical child attends a
school with an ‘Outstanding’ Ofsted rating (i.e. the child is from the Jones
family). ‘High time investment’ and ‘High material investment’ are dummy
variables equal to 1 if the scenario involves the higher level of time and
material investments respectively. Columns (1) and (2) give the results from
pooled OLS and fixed effects estimation respectively. The final column adds
in interaction terms between the three dummy variables corresponding to
high levels of the three investment types to the fixed effects model estimated
in Column (2). ‘Sample mean’ refers to the average expected earnings (in £s)
across all eight scenarios for the 14,402 observations used in the estimation.

variables (Column 3). Our results are robust to these different specifications. The results in Column 3
show that attending a high quality school is associated with a 9.6% increase in expected earnings.
Spending three more hours per week with the child translates to a rise in expected earnings of 21.0%,
while spending £30 more per week translates to a rise in expected earnings of 15.1%. All these estimates
are highly significant at the 1% level. Moreover, the coefficient on time investments is significantly
higher than the coefficient on material investments, suggesting, as in Figure 1, that parents perceive 3
hours of additional time investments to be more productive than £30 of additional material investments
(at the 1% level). Both of these perceived returns are in turn significantly greater than the perceived
returns to school quality (at the 1% level). As shown in column (3), parents do not perceive parental

19

time investments to be complementary to school quality or parental material investments. They do,
however, perceive the returns to parental material investments to be significantly higher if the child
attends a high quality school. In particular, parents perceive the returns to £30 of weekly material
investments to be 9.3% (or 1.4 percentage points) greater if the child attends a school which is rated
as ‘Outstanding’ rather than a school which ‘Requires Improvement’.
Whether parental beliefs on the returns to different types of investment are roughly correct is an
interesting question, but one that would be very hard to answer with the data we have available.
In observational data, it is difficult to find exogenous variation in educational investments made by
parents that would allow us to obtain unbiased estimates of their returns to which we could compare
the beliefs data. Having said that, if the data on individual beliefs are accurate, they should be
informative about parental investment, regardless of whether beliefs about returns are correct.
Tables 5 and 6 show the results from performing the analysis separately for the different subgroups
respondents were randomized in (see overview in Table 2). As in Table 4, expected earnings are
significantly increasing in the three investment types for each subgroup. With regards to differences
between subgroups, Panel A of Table 5 provides evidence of perceived diminishing returns to parental
time and material investments. More specifically, the returns are perceived as significantly higher when
investments rise from 0 hours to 3 hours and from £0 to £30 (‘Group 0’) than when investments rise
from 1 hour to 4 hours and from £10 to £40 (‘Group 1’). Note also that there is a significant difference
in the intercept, as Group 1’s baseline level of investment is higher, and no significant difference in
expected returns to school quality, as one would expect. Turning to differences across initial skill
levels (Panel B of Table 5), parents believe that high ability children will earn more in the future
(as indicated by the significantly different intercept). However, they do not perceive the returns to
investments to differ depending on the initial level of the child’s skill. Similarly, we do not find that
parents perceive the returns to be different depending on the gender of the child (Panel A of Table 6).
Finally, when we compare the perceived returns to investments by the year of school the child in the
scenario is currently in, we find that parents perceive the returns to school quality to be higher when
the child in the scenario is in Year 7 rather than in Year 3 (Panel B of Table 6).12
We note that for all different subgroups we find a positive coefficient on the interaction term
between parental material investments and school quality. However, this coefficient is now less precisely
12 We

do not find that parents perceive the returns to parental time or material investments to be different depending
on the time period during which investments are made. In contrast, Boneva and Rauh (2018) which uses a withinsubject design to examine the perceived dynamic properties of the production function finds that parents also perceive
the returns to parental time investments to be higher in later time periods.

Heterogeneity in Perceived Returns

The estimates presented in the previous section mask a substantial degree of heterogeneity in perceived
returns across respondents. For each respondent, we can calculate the perceived return to time,
material and school investments. To obtain a measure of individual perceived returns to time investments,
riT ime , we compare the parent’s responses in the four scenarios in which time investments are high to the
parent’s responses in the four corresponding scenarios in which time investments are low. We average
across these differences and divide by three to obtain the average perceived return to 1 additional hour
of time investments:

riT ime =

y4 − y2
y7 − y5
y8 − y6
1 1 y3 − y1
[

].

22

We analogously calculate individual perceived returns to £10 of material investments, which we
denote as riM aterial , as well as the perceived returns to high school quality for each respondent, riSchool .
Appendix Figure A.1 shows the cumulative distributions of individual perceived returns. The
distributions for perceived returns to material and time investments are similar, though perceived
returns to time investments are slightly larger indicated through the shift to the right. For school
quality, the perceived returns are somewhat more dispersed. Figure A.2 in the Appendix shows the
joint distribution of perceived returns to time and material investments (Panel A), time and school
investments (Panel B) and material and school investments (Panel C). Again we can see that there
is a substantial degree of heterogeneity in perceived returns. Moreover, we can see that parents who
perceive one type of investment to be more productive are also more likely to perceive the other types
of investments as more productive. This can also be seen in Table 7 which shows the Spearman rank
correlations between the different perceived returns. All correlations are positive and significant at
the 1% level. The correlation between the perceived returns to parental time and parental material
investments seems to be especially high (corr=0.42).

‘Time’, ‘Material’ and ‘School’ refer to the

quality investments, respectively.

While the variation in perceived returns across parents is high, we document in Table 8 that
neither parent, nor child or household characteristics can explain a substantial part of the variation in
perceived returns. The R-squared of the regressions are low and only few characteristics are associated
with parental beliefs about the returns to investments. We document that fathers perceive the returns
to school quality as significantly lower compared to mothers, and that older parents as well as parents
who are working perceive the returns to time investments as significantly lower. We do not find any
significant associations between perceived returns and education of parents or income, irrespective of
whether we control for additional household and child characteristics as in Table 8 or not. Parents
with a university degree or parents with above median income do not perceive the returns to any of
the three types of investments to be greater. To allow for potential non-linearities we also estimate the
specification using income quartiles as regressors (see Appendix Table A.4). Again we find no significant

23

associations between income and perceived returns. These results are surprising and contrast with the
findings in Boneva and Rauh (2018) who document differences in perceived returns to time investments
by the socioeconomic background of the respondent. We also do not find any notable differences in
perceived returns by the perceived academic ability of the respondent’s own child. In the following
section, we investigate whether the heterogeneity in perceived returns is associated with actual parental
investment decisions.

4.4

Do Perceived Returns Predict Current Parental Investments?

Our data contains rich information on current parental investment decisions. We can use this information,
together with the elicited returns, to investigate whether parental beliefs about the returns to investments
are predictive of parents’ current investment choices while controlling for a range of parent and child
characteristics. In Table 9, we regress the time parents report to spend every week on different activities
(in minutes) on the individual perceived returns to time investments. We find that parental beliefs
about the returns to parental time investments are significantly associated with the amount of time
parents spend on different activities with their children (at the 1% level). Overall, an increase in the
perceived return by 10 percentage points is associated with parents spending 46 more minutes every
week on these activities (column 5). In contrast to the common finding in the literature that more
educated parents invest more time into their children, we do not find a significant positive effect of
parental education on time invested. However, we do find some evidence that household income is
positively related to time invested. We also find that time investments are increasing in the children’s
own ability, i.e. they are reinforcing in skills. In terms of household specialization, mothers seem to
invest significantly more time than fathers.
Similarly, we find that parental beliefs about the returns to parental material investments significantly
predict the amount parents spend on different educational resources every month (such as books,
educational games etc.). Overall, an increase in the perceived return by 10 percentage points is
associated with an increase in monthly spending by approximately £14.8 (Column 5), which is significant
at the 1% level. When we use alternative measures to summarize how much time parents or how much
money parents spend on their children (e.g. when we extract a factor from the money/time spent
on the different categories), again we find a positive and significant association (see Columns 6 in the
respective tables). In the case of material investments, we find that they are positively and significantly
related to the education level, income and employment status of the parent. As for time investments,
material investments are also reinforcing in children’s skills.
Finally, we regress the quality of the school the child currently attends on individual perceived
returns to high school quality. We do not find a significant association between these two variables.13
However, school quality can only be changed through rather large discrete investments, such as moving
neighborhoods. In order to look at a more continuous measure, we look at the amount of school fees
parents pay and find that the perceived returns to school quality significantly predict the amount of
13 We

also do not find any significant association if we perform an ordered probit analysis.

25

school fees paid.
We perform several robustness checks and find that our results are robust to us excluding all those
individuals from the analysis for whom the implied returns to any given type of investment are negative
(see Tables A.5, A.6 and A.7 in the Appendix). They are also robust to us controlling for individual
beliefs about returns to the other two types of investments (see Tables A.8, A.9 and A.10 in the
Appendix). Overall, parental beliefs about the returns to investments are predictive of the educational
investment decisions that parents make for their children. These results are consistent with a model
in which parental beliefs play an important role in parental investment decisions.

4.5

Beliefs about the Malleability of Skills

In the previous sections, we document several interesting patterns regarding the heterogeneity in
individual responses. Firstly, individuals differ substantially in their beliefs regarding the productivity
or usefulness of different investments. Secondly, parents who perceive one type of investment as more
productive are also more likely to believe that the other investments have a higher return. A natural
question which emerges is why some parents perceive all investment types as being important while
other parents perceive the returns to all types of investments to be low.
One hypothesis one might have is that there is an underlying reason which can explain individual
beliefs about the returns to any type of investment made in children. For example, it could very well
be that parents differ in their mindsets regarding whether children’s skills are malleable in general
and whether they are responsive to any type of input. To investigate this question in more detail, we
administer an additional parental mindset questionnaire which aims to measure parents’ beliefs about
the malleability of children’s skills. This questionnaire is inspired by the work of Dweck (2006) who
documents that individuals differ substantially in their mindset regarding the malleability of their own
intelligence.
To measure parental mindsets, we present parents with a series of items which pertain to the
malleability of children’s skills, and ask parents to rate these items on a Likert-type scale (e.g., My child
develops at his/her own pace and there is not much I can do about that’). The full list of all questions
can be found in Appendix B. We extract a factor from parents’ responses and first investigate how the
extracted factor correlates with the perceived returns to time investments, material investments and
school quality calculated in Section 4.3. The results reveal that parental mindsets are indeed positively
and significantly correlated with parental beliefs about the returns to time investments (corr=0.173, p-

26

value<0.001) as well as parental beliefs about the returns to school quality (corr=0.137, p-value<0.001).
Put differently, parents who do not perceive children’s skills to be malleable in general also perceive the
returns to investments to be lower. Column 4 of Table 8 documents which individual characteristics
predict parental mindset. We note that fathers are significantly less likely to perceive their children’s
skills to be malleable through home inputs and that wealthier parents perceive their children’s skills
as significantly more malleable.
These results are important as previous studies have shown that it is possible to change the
investments individuals make into their own skills by changing individual beliefs regarding the malleability
of their skills (see, e.g., Alan, Boneva and Ertac 2015). Interventions that target parental beliefs about
the malleability of their children’s skills may hence be effective in altering parental beliefs about the
returns to educational investments and may therefore encourage parents to invest more into their
children.

Conclusion

To understand why some parents invest more into their children and to gain a better understanding
of how parents might respond to policy changes, it is important to understand how parents perceive
the returns to different types of investments. We elicit parental beliefs about returns to investments
in terms of time, money, and school quality, as well as their perceptions about the complementarity
or substitutability between these different inputs. Importantly, our research design allows us to relate
perceived returns to actual investments made by parents.
Using a representative sample of parents in England, we find perceived returns to all three different
types of investments to be positive and of considerable magnitude. We document that parents perceive
the returns to 3 hours of weekly parental time investments or £30 of weekly material investments
to matter more than moving a child to a better school. Moreover, we find that parents perceive
school quality and material investments as complementary, i.e. parents perceive the returns to material
investments to be higher if the child attends a high quality school. Interestingly, parents who perceive
the returns to one type of investment to be high, are also more likely to perceive the returns to the other
types of investments to be high. Importantly, we establish that parents who perceive the returns to
investments to be higher also invest considerably more into their children. These results are consistent
with parental beliefs playing a very important role in parental investment decisions.
The results of our study are important because they can help us identify bottlenecks which prevent
27

parents from investing into their children. They can also help us shed more light on the question
how policy changes may bring about changes in parental behavior. For instance, we find that parents
perceive that the returns to material investments are higher if school quality is higher. Therefore, if
a policy is introduced that improves school quality then our results suggest that parents are likely to
also increase material investments in response to this change. While this is desirable in a sense that
children would on average receive higher levels of investments, this may also deepen socioeconomic gaps
in investment levels as more affluent parents have greater means to increase the material investments
they make into their children.
When we look at what drives perceived returns, we find, perhaps surprisingly, that the perceived
productivity of investments is not related to parental background. However, we find that the productivity
of investment is positively related to beliefs about the malleability of skills in general. This suggests
that one bottleneck to investments might be that some parents think that skills are not malleable.
One promising avenue for policy could be to engage parents in training and information campaigns
in which the idea is conveyed that skills are malleable and can be affected in the home environment.
A similar intervention which targets the beliefs of school children has produced promising results in
terms of the effort children exert to accumulate skills as well as students’ performance on standardized
tests (Alan, Boneva and Ertac 2015). Whether or not a home intervention that targets parental beliefs
would be successful in raising parental investment levels and child outcomes is an open question that
future research should address.

Notes: Standard errors in parentheses. * p<0.10, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01. All regressions include a constant. Observations are weighted
according to the age and gender of the parent’s own child and the education level of the responding parent. For Columns (1)-(5), the dependent
variable is the number of minutes spent (in minutes) with their own child per week on the five different activities shown in the column headings,
while Column (6) treats the sum across all activities as the dependent variable. ‘Reading’ refers to time spent per week (in minutes) during
term-time reading to/with the child, while ‘Talking’ refers to time spent talking with or listening to the child. ‘Helping’ denotes time spent
helping or teaching the child, and ‘Playing’ refers to time spent playing with him/her (including sports). ‘Other’ refers to all other activities
related to the child’s education. In the final column, the dependent variable ‘Activities’ is the extracted first principal component from the
responses to the five activities. ‘Perceived returns (time)’ refers to the perceived returns to time investments calculated in Section 4.3. ‘High
income’ is a dummy variable equal to 1 if gross annual household income is above the median for our sample, and zero otherwise. ‘Own child’s
academic ability’ refers to the academic ability of the child perceived by the parent on a scale of 0-100, where a higher response reflects higher
perceived ability. ‘Foreign language at home’ denotes whether the parent speaks any language other than English at home. ‘Sample mean’
gives the mean of the dependent variable using only those observations used in the relevant estimation.

Notes: Standard errors in parentheses. * p<0.10, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01. All regressions include a constant. Observations
are weighted according to the age and gender of the parent’s own child and the education level of the responding parent. For
Columns (1)-(4), the dependent variable is the amount spent per month (in £s) on the respective category given by the column
headings. ‘Books’ refers to expenditures on books other than school books, while ‘Educ. games’ denotes spending on educational
games and toys. ‘Societies’ denotes monthly expenditure on sports clubs, music lessons and other societies/clubs, while ‘Tuition’
refers to private tuition. Column (5) treats the sum of these four expenditure categories (denoted as ‘Total’) as the dependent
variable. In the final column, the dependent variable ‘Expenditure’ is the extracted first principal component from the responses
to the four expenditure categories. ‘Perceived returns (material)’ refers to the perceived returns to time investments calculated in
Section 4.3. ‘High income’ is a dummy variable equal to 1 if gross annual household income is above the median for our sample,
and zero otherwise. ‘Own child’s academic ability’ refers to the academic ability of the child perceived by the parent on a scale
of 0-100, where a higher response reflects higher perceived ability. ‘Foreign language at home’ denotes whether the parent speaks
any language other than English at home. ‘Sample mean’ gives the mean of the dependent variable using only those observations
used in the relevant estimation.

Notes: Standard errors in parentheses. * p<0.10, ** p<0.05,
*** p<0.01. Standard errors are clustered at the parent
level. All regressions include a constant. Observations are
weighted according to the age and gender of the parent’s own
child and the education level of the responding parent. The
dependent variable ‘School’ is a discrete variable based on the
Ofsted rating of the child’s school. ‘School’ takes value 1 if
the school is rated as ‘Inadequate’, 2 if ‘Satisfactory/Requires
improvement’, 3 if ‘Good’ and 4 if ‘Outstanding’. ‘Fees’
refers to the amount spent per month (in £s) on school fees.
‘Perceived returns (school)’ refers to the perceived returns to
school quality calculated in Section 4.3. ‘High income’ is a
dummy variable equal to 1 if gross annual household income
is above the median for our sample, and zero otherwise. ‘Own
child’s academic ability’ refers to the academic ability of the
child perceived by the parent on a scale of 0-100, where a higher
response reflects higher perceived ability. ‘Foreign language at
home’ denotes whether the parent speaks any language other
than English at home. ‘Sample mean’ gives the mean of the
dependent variable using only those observations used in the
relevant estimation.

Notes: Standard errors in parentheses. * p<0.10, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01. All regressions
include a constant. Observations are weighted according to the age and gender of the
parent’s own child and the education level of the responding parent. ‘Time’, ‘Material’
and ‘School’ are the individual perceived returns to time investments, material investments
and school quality, respectively, while ‘Mindset’ is the extracted factor from the growth
mindset/malleability of skills questionnaire. ‘Sample mean’ gives the mean of the
dependent variable using only those observations used in the relevant estimation.

Notes: Standard errors in parentheses. * p<0.10, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01. All regressions include a constant. Observations are weighted according
to the age and gender of the parent’s own child and the education level of the responding parent. The analysis is limited to those individuals for
whom the implied perceived returns to time investments are non-negative. For Columns (1)-(5), the dependent variable is the number of minutes
spent (in minutes) with their own child per week on the five different activities shown in the column headings, while Column (6) treats the sum
across all activities as the dependent variable. ‘Reading’ refers to time spent per week (in minutes) during term-time reading to/with the child,
while ‘Talking’ refers to time spent talking with or listening to the child. ‘Helping’ denotes time spent helping or teaching the child, and ‘Playing’
refers to time spent playing with him/her (including sports). ‘Other’ refers to all other activities related to the child’s education. In the final
column, the dependent variable ‘Activities’ is the extracted first principal component from the responses to the five activities. ‘Perceived returns
(time)’ refers to the perceived returns to time investments calculated in Section 4.3. ‘High income’ is a dummy variable equal to 1 if gross annual
household income is above the median for our sample, and zero otherwise. ‘Own child’s academic ability’ refers to the academic ability of the
child perceived by the parent on a scale of 0-100, where a higher response reflects higher perceived ability. ‘Foreign language at home’ denotes
whether the parent speaks any language other than English at home. ‘Sample mean’ gives the mean of the dependent variable using only those
observations used in the relevant estimation.

Notes: Standard errors in parentheses. * p<0.10, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01. All regressions include a constant. Observations are
weighted according to the age and gender of the parent’s own child and the education level of the responding parent. The analysis
is limited to those individuals for whom the implied perceived returns to material investments are non-negative. For Columns
(1)-(4), the dependent variable is the amount spent per month (in £s) on the respective category given by the column headings.
‘Books’ refers to expenditures on books other than school books, while ‘Educ. games’ denotes spending on educational games and
toys. ‘Societies’ denotes monthly expenditure on sports clubs, music lessons and other societies/clubs, while ‘Tuition’ refers to
private tuition. Column (5) treats the sum of these four expenditure categories (denoted as ‘Total’) as the dependent variable. In
the final column, the dependent variable ‘Expenditure’ is the extracted first principal component from the responses to the four
expenditure categories. ‘Perceived returns (material)’ refers to the perceived returns to time investments calculated in Section
4.3. ‘High income’ is a dummy variable equal to 1 if gross annual household income is above the median for our sample, and
zero otherwise. ‘Own child’s academic ability’ refers to the academic ability of the child perceived by the parent on a scale of 0100, where a higher response reflects higher perceived ability. ‘Foreign language at home’ denotes whether the parent speaks any
language other than English at home. ‘Sample mean’ gives the mean of the dependent variable using only those observations used
in the relevant estimation.

Notes: Standard errors in parentheses. * p<0.10, ** p<0.05,
*** p<0.01. Standard errors are clustered at the parent
level. All regressions include a constant. Observations are
weighted according to the age and gender of the parent’s own
child and the education level of the responding parent. The
analysis is limited to those individuals for whom the implied
perceived returns to school quality are non-negative. The
dependent variable ‘School’ is a discrete variable based on the
Ofsted rating of the child’s school. ‘School’ takes value 1 if
the school is rated as ‘Inadequate’, 2 if ‘Satisfactory/Requires
improvement’, 3 if ‘Good’ and 4 if ‘Outstanding’. ‘Fees’
refers to the amount spent per month (in £s) on school fees.
‘Perceived returns (school)’ refers to the perceived returns to
school quality calculated in Section 4.3. ‘High income’ is a
dummy variable equal to 1 if gross annual household income
is above the median for our sample, and zero otherwise. ‘Own
child’s academic ability’ refers to the academic ability of the
child perceived by the parent on a scale of 0-100, where a higher
response reflects higher perceived ability. ‘Foreign language at
home’ denotes whether the parent speaks any language other
than English at home. ‘Sample mean’ gives the mean of the
dependent variable using only those observations used in the
relevant estimation.

Notes: Standard errors in parentheses. * p<0.10, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01. All regressions include a constant. Observations are
weighted according to the age and gender of the parent’s own child and the education level of the responding parent. For Columns
(1)-(4), the dependent variable is the amount spent per month (in £s) on the respective category given by the column headings.
‘Books’ refers to expenditures on books other than school books, while ‘Educ. games’ denotes spending on educational games and
toys. ‘Societies’ denotes monthly expenditure on sports clubs, music lessons and other societies/clubs, while ‘Tuition’ refers to
private tuition. Column (5) treats the sum of these four expenditure categories (denoted as ‘Total’) as the dependent variable. In
the final column, the dependent variable ‘Expenditure’ is the extracted first principal component from the responses to the four
expenditure categories. ‘Perceived returns (material)’ refers to the perceived returns to time investments calculated in Section
4.3. ‘High income’ is a dummy variable equal to 1 if gross annual household income is above the median for our sample, and
zero otherwise. ‘Own child’s academic ability’ refers to the academic ability of the child perceived by the parent on a scale of 0100, where a higher response reflects higher perceived ability. ‘Foreign language at home’ denotes whether the parent speaks any
language other than English at home. ‘Sample mean’ gives the mean of the dependent variable using only those observations used
in the relevant estimation.

Notes: Standard errors in parentheses. * p<0.10, ** p<0.05,

All regressions include a constant. Observations are weighted
according to the age and gender of the parent’s own child and
the education level of the responding parent. The dependent
variable ‘School’ is a discrete variable based on the Ofsted rating
of the child’s school. ‘School’ takes value 1 if the school is rated
as ‘Inadequate’, 2 if ‘Satisfactory/Requires improvement’, 3 if
‘Good’ and 4 if ‘Outstanding’. ‘Fees’ refers to the amount spent
per month (in £s) on school fees. ‘Perceived returns (school)’
refers to the perceived returns to school quality calculated in
Section 4.3. ‘High income’ is a dummy variable equal to 1 if gross
annual household income is above the median for our sample,
and zero otherwise. ‘Own child’s academic ability’ refers to the
academic ability of the child perceived by the parent on a scale of
0-100, where a higher response reflects higher perceived ability.
‘Foreign language at home’ denotes whether the parent speaks
any language other than English at home. ‘Sample mean’ gives
the mean of the dependent variable using only those observations
used in the relevant estimation.

Appendix B: Questionnaires
B.1 Hypothetical Investment Scenarios
Next we are interested in your opinion about how important it is for parents to devote time and financial
resources to help their children acquire new skills. For this purpose, we will ask you to imagine two
average British families, the Jones and the Smiths, who make decisions about how much time and
money to devote to their children. More specifically, we will show you different scenarios and ask you
what you think the likely yearly earnings of the child will be at age 30. We know these questions are
difficult. Please try to consider each scenario carefully and tell us what you believe the likely outcome
to be.

Mr and Mrs Jones have one child, John.14 John is in Year 3 of primary school15 , and he attends a
popular school, which has been rated as ’Outstanding’. In the KS1 SATs John achieved the expected
level.16 During school years 3-6, Mr and Mrs Jones can decide how much time to devote to helping
John acquire new skills (e.g. by reading to/with John, playing educational games, talking to John,
helping John with his school work etc.) and how much money to spend on educational resources which
help John acquire new skills (e.g. books, educational games, private tuition etc.). Assuming there is
no inflation, what do you expect John’s gross yearly earnings to be when he is 30 years old...17

A) if they help John for 0 hours every week to acquire new skills, and they spend £0 every week on
educational resources which help John to acquire new skills.
B) if they help John for 0 hours every week to acquire new skills, and they spend £30 every week on
educational resources which help John to acquire new skills.
C) if they help John for 3 hours every week to acquire new skills, and they spend £0 every week on
educational resources which help John to acquire new skills.
D) if they help John for 3 hours every week to acquire new skills, and they spend £30 every week on
educational resources which help John to acquire new skills.
14 Half of the parents in our sample were randomised into seeing a son (John) with the other half seeing a daughter
(Jane).
15 Parents were randomly selected into seeing either a child in Year 3 (primary school) or Year 7 (secondary school) in
order to analyse the effect of the timing of investments.
16 Half of the parents saw a child who achieved the expected level (high initial skill level) and half saw a child who did
not (low initial skill level)
17 Parents saw either low/high time and material investments of 0 hours/3 hours and £0/£30 respectively (Group 0)
or low/high time and material investments of 1 hour/4 hours and £10/£40 respectively (Group 1).

46

Now imagine a different family, the Smiths. In many respects the Smiths are very similar to the
Jones.18 For example, Mr and Mrs Smith also have one child, Simon, who is in Year 3 of primary
school. They live in the same neighbourhood as Mr and Mrs Jones and they have similar levels of
income and education. Also, the two children John and Simon have similar levels of intellectual ability
and they both achieved the expected level in the KS1 SATs. However, there is one difference. Unlike
John’s school, which is popular and has been rated as ’Outstanding’, Simon’s school is not very popular
and has only been rated as ’Requires Improvement’. Assuming there is no inflation, what do you expect
Simon’s gross yearly earnings to be when he is 30 years old...

A) if they help Simon for 0 hours every week to acquire new skills, and they spend £0 every week on
educational resources which help Simon to acquire new skills.
B) if they help Simon for 0 hours every week to acquire new skills, and they spend £30 every week on
educational resources which help Simon to acquire new skills.
C) if they help Simon for 3 hours every week to acquire new skills, and they spend £0 every week on
educational resources which help Simon to acquire new skills.
D) if they help Simon for 3 hours every week to acquire new skills, and they spend £30 every week on
educational resources which help Simon to acquire new skills.

B.2 Parental Investment Questions
In the following, please think about you and your child.
How much time do you usually spend on each of the following activities during term-time? Please
provide time spent in minutes on a typical weekdays and the time spend in minutes on a typical
weekend day. If you don’t engage in a given activity, please insert 0.
1) Reading to/with child
2) Talking with/listening to child
3) Helping/teaching child
4) Playing with child (including sports)
5) Other activities related to child’s education
18 The

age, gender and initial skill level of the hypothetical child and the levels of low/high investments seen by parents
are kept the same for the two families.

47

During term-time, how much money do you on average spend (in £s) on the following categories per
month for your child? If you don’t spend any money in a given category, please insert 0.
1) Books (other than school books)
2) Educational games and toys
3) Sports clubs/music lessons/other societies
4) Private tuition
5) School fees

B.3 Supplementary Mindset Questionnaire
To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statements? [1 "Strongly disagree" 2
"Disagree" 3 "Neither agree nor disagree" 4 "Agree" 5 "Strongly agree"]
1) My child develops at his/her own pace and there is not much I can do about that.
2) If my child is not performing well in school, there is a lot I can do to help my child perform
better.
3) My child is a certain kind of person, and there is not much that can be done to really change
that.
4) Some children get more discouraged by setbacks than others - there is not much I as a parent
can do to change that.
