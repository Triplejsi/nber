On the Difference Between Tax and Spending Policies
in Models with Finte Horizons

ABSTRACT
This paper uses the Blanchard (1985) finite horizon model to
study how
taxes and government spending can be
managed to stabilize aggregate demand.
It is shown that tax policy cannot stabilize demand in less time than it
the public debt, but that, if government
spending is the
instrument of policy, demand can be stabilized
independently of the dynamics
of the debt. These results imply that if the objective
is to stabilize the
debt while maintaining demand as close as possible to a
pre-determinedtarget
path, and taxes are the instrument, taxes would have to be changed
as
much
as
temporarily
feasible. On the other hand, if the instrument is
government spending, it can be changed gradually to achieve the objectives.

stabilizes

The dynamic effects of taxes are a
straightforward implication of the
intertemporal budget constraint, when it is assumed that agents cannot be
surprised by government policies. More traditional dynamics can be obtained
if it is assumed that the government succeeds in
announcing a policy and
implementing a different one. If however the announcement is no credible,
discretion is inferior to a predetermined tax rule.

The main implication of these propositions for macroeconomic
modelling is that the time pattern of consumption depends on the
time profile of taxes and of the public debt. This fact has of
course been recognized at least since Modigliani and Brumberg laid
down the life—cycle theory of household behaviour in 1954 and Ando
and
Modigliani (1963) estimated the resulting equation for
consumption expenditure.

with a new blend of rigor into issues which have long been central
and policy. In a recent paper Gaul and
to macroeconomic theory
Masera (1988) have used an open economy version of Blanchards
model to answer the following question. Suppose an exogenous shack
(e.g. an increase in the world rate of interest) causes the public
debt to start rising: does a combination of fiscal and monetary
policy exist that stabilizes the public debt while keeping income
along some predetermined path (so as to avoid both unemployment
and inflation)?
The core of the problem is the following, Aggregate demand
is a function of both the flows (of taxes and government spending
and the stock of the debt. When the latter starts to rise and the

compensates the effects of a growing debt on the level activity.
The ensuing policy prescription is that spending be reduced
gradually.
The work of Galli and Masera focussed on government spending
as the instrument;
nothing is said about taxes,, which are held
constant in the analysis. It turns out that in this model the
economics of tax policy is very different from that of public
spending. The effects of these two policies differ for reasons
which go well beyond those popularized by Haavelmo's (1945)
analysis of the balanced budget multiplier.

this means changing the stock of the debt by the stroke of a pen.
Even if one rules out extreme solutions, it still remains that
shock treatment,
rather
than gradualism, is the prescription of
this model when taxes, rather than spending, are the instrument of
policy.

The following proposition further highlights the difference
between tax and spending policies. When government spending is
increased, there exists no sequence of present and future taxes of
finite size that can avoid fluctuations of the level of activity.
When spending is increased, the debt starts to rise: until it
reaches a position of rest, consumption continues to rise. If
taxes are raised as much as spending so as to keep the budget in
balance, income rises as in Haavelmo's model. In order to avoid
the
increase in income, taxes must be increased by more: the debt
then starts to fall and so does consumption until the system has
reached a new steady state. In substance, if taxes are raised so
as to keep the debt constant, income varies; if they are raised by
the amount that is necessary to stabilize income, the debt starts
to vary and so do consumption and income.
The
sharp asymmetry between the dynamic effects of tax and
spending policies in this model is, in our view, rather puzzling
and worth some investigation in order to understand its economic

subject to the expected policy. It is shown that, given a loss
function in the deviation of income from target, a tax policy
exists that hits the target in every period. Furthermore, under
these assumptions,
it is possible to derive an expression which
closely resembles the consumption function estimated by Ando and
Nodigliani (1963>.

can be made more general in two ways. First a single change in T

furthermore the time it takes to
stabilize income is no smaller than the time it takes to stabilize
the public debt. The reverse is not true; the debt may be fixed
while consumption and income change.
These points are easily proved. From eq. (13) we know that
A
0 implies that the level of the debt be constant.
Recalling
that consumption depends only on A, this means that consumption
will always vary unless the debt is constant. Since A is the sum
of human wealth plus the debt, another way of stating this point
is to say that under no circumstance can the variation of human
wealth be equal in size and opposite in sign to that of the debt.
To illustrate this point, suppose for a moment that there is no

Current taxes can be used to control the dynamics of the debt,

that causes current human wealth to vary, at least for some time,
in such a way as to keep the sum of human wealth and the debt

This point is much more general than the model used in this
paper: eq. (13) is derived exclusively from aggregation of the

Interpretation
The

results

of

the previous section are somewhat puzzling

for two reasons.
First,
they are at variance with what one can obtain from a
traditional consumption function; this is often written in a form
like

(22)

C

c[Y—T,W]

l
In (22) there always exist a level and rate of change
of T that
holds C constant at any desired level when W
0.
Second, from a mathematical point of view, there are as many
instruments
independent
Cone tax for each period) as there are
targets (income in each period). The mathematical puzzle is easily
resolved noting that the target can be attained continuously

moving the instruments by an infinite amount: if wealth taxes can
be levied (which is the same as setting the flow of T equals to
then wealth can instantly be brought to the desired
infinity),
steady state. A surprise wealth tax (or subsidy) solves the
problem of the debt and that of the stabilization of income at the
same time.
From the economic point of view, the lack of controllability
of the system derives critically from the assumption that agents
know future policies.
If

we

relax

this

assumption,
agents will maximize (1)
subject to (2) and aggregate consumption and wealth will still be
given by (8) and (14). Human wealth will not however accumulate as
in eq. (7). The discounted value of expected net income will have
to be written as

The presence of the surprise term Y(t) in (26) suggests that it
should now be possible to control the level and the dynamics of A
independently of W. We pursue this idea and assume that agents
have rational expectations in the sense that they compute future
income
in a way that is consistent with the model; they may
however be wrong in their forecasts of future taxes. Under these
we can derive a consumption function which is very
assumptions,
similar to (22).
The solution is obtained as follows. We first compute the
value of A(t) which is consistent with the model, given W(t) and
agents expectations about future taxes. In the Appendix, we show
that this is given by

main point is that in (33), as well as in (22), wealth
and taxes appear separately so that the system can be controlled

From (32) and the goods market condition (11), one can solve
for T(t) as a function of the desired level of income
