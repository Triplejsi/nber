ABSTRACT
Labor markets in U.S. cities today are vastly more educated and skill-intensive than they were
five decades ago. Yet, urban non-college workers perform substantially less skilled work than
decades earlier. This deskilling reflects the joint effects of automation and international trade,
which have eliminated the bulk of non-college production, administrative support, and clerical
jobs, yielding a disproportionate polarization of urban labor markets. The unwinding of the urban
non-college occupational skill gradient has, I argue, abetted a secular fall in real non-college
wages by: (1) shunting non-college workers out of specialized middle-skill occupations into lowwage occupations that require only generic skills; (2) diminishing the set of non-college workers
that hold middle-skill jobs in high-wage cities; and (3) attenuating, to a startling degree, the steep
urban wage premium for non-college workers that prevailed in earlier decades. Changes in the
nature of work—many of which are technological in origin—have been more disruptive and less
beneficial for non-college than college workers.

One of the enduring paradoxes that has accompanied the rise of wage inequality over the
last four decades in industrialized economies is the sustained fall in real wages experienced
by less-educated workers.1 . This fall is seen in the U.S., Germany, and the U.K., among
other nations Dustmann et al. 2009; Acemoglu and Autor 2011; Blundell et al. 2018. It is
illustrated for the U.S. in Figure 1, which plots cumulative changes in real log weekly wage
and salary earnings of full-time, full-year workers between 1963 and 2017.
The progression of inequality over these five and a half decades can be roughly divided
into three epochs: (1) the ten-year interval between 1963 and 1972, when real wages rose
robustly and evenly among all education by gender groups; (2) the interregnum between 1973
and 1979 when, following the first U.S. oil shock, real earnings growth stagnated throughout the distribution; and (3) the era of secularly rising wage inequality from 1980 forward,
where wages rose robustly among the most-educated and fell in real terms among the leasteducated—most strikingly, among men with less than a bachelor’s degree.2 Among high
school dropouts, high school graduates, and those with some college, real weekly earnings
among full-time male workers in 2018 were 10 to 20 log points below their real levels in
1980. While the evolution of real wages was less adverse among non-college women, there
was a fifteen-plus year period between 1981 and 1997 when women with high school or lower
education earned less than their counterparts in 1980.
1

While inequality has many facets—inequality of labor versus non-labor income, income versus consumption inequality, transient versus permanent earnings inequality, ‘between-group’ versus residual inequality,
inequality of top incomes (i.e., ‘the one percent’) versus inequality elsewhere in the distribution (‘the other
99 percent’)—my focus here is on the inequality of wage and salary earnings by education and sex. For
discussion of other aspects of inequality, see Lemieux 2006; Autor 2014; Piketty and Saez 2014; Aguiar and
Bils 2015
2
Within this post-1979 epoch, two sub-periods of robust wage growth deserve mention: the years 1995
to 2000, corresponding to the so-called ’Dot Com’ boom; and the sustained economic expansion from 2012
to present, following the end of the Great Recession. While the 1995–2000 interval saw rapid wage growth
without any reduction in wage inequality, Figure 1 suggests that during the current expansion, wages are
rising particularly rapidly among the least educated.

Figure uses March Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement data for earnings
years 1963 to 2017. Series correspond to (composition-adjusted) mean log wage for each group, using data
on full-time, full-year workers ages 16 to 64. The data are sorted into sex-education-experience groups of two
sexes, five education categories (high school dropout, high school graduate, some college, college graduate,
and post-college degree), and four potential experience categories (0–9, 10–19, 20–29, and 30–39 years).
Educational categories are harmonized following the procedures in Autor et al. (2008). Log weekly wages of
full-time, full-year workers are regressed in each year separately by sex on dummy variables for four education
categories, a quartic in experience, three region dummies, black and other race dummies, and interactions
of the experience quartic with three broad education categories (high school graduate, some college, and
college plus). The (composition-adjusted) mean log wage for each of the forty groups in a given year is the
predicted log wage from these regressions evaluated for whites, living in the mean geographic region, at the
relevant experience level (5, 15, 25, or 35 years depending on the experience group). Mean log wages for
broader groups in each year represent weighted averages of the relevant (composition-adjusted) cell means
using a fixed set of weights, equal to the mean share of total hours worked by each group over 1963–2005.
All earnings numbers are deflated by the chain-weighted (implicit) price deflator for personal consumption
expenditures. Earnings of less than $67/week in 1982 dollars ($112/week in 2000 dollars) are dropped.
Allocated earnings observations are excluded in earnings years 1967 forward using either family earnings
allocation flags (1967–1974) or individual earnings allocation flags (1975 earnings year forward).

It is far harder to rationalize the falling real wages of non-college workers in this same
framework, however. If college and non-college workers are gross complements, as we have just
3

assumed, an increase in the relative supply of college workers or a rise in their productivity
should boost the productivity—and hence the wages—of non-college workers. This assertion
is no more mysterious than the notion that capital complements labor, which implies that
capital deepening should raise labor productivity and hence wages. But this outcome has
demonstrably not occurred. Over the course of nearly four decades, non-college workers in
the United States have not as a group benefited from the rising supply and productivity of
college-educated workers.

Data source is as in Figure 1. Sample consists of all persons aged 16 to 64 who reported having
worked at least one week in the earnings years, excluding those in the military. For each
individual, hours worked are the product of usual hours worked per week and the number of
weeks worked last year. Individual hours worked are aggregated using CPS sampling weights.

That paradox is the subject of this paper. There are of course many potential explanations, including but not limited to eroding union penetration and bargaining power, falling
federal and state minimum wages, rising trade pressure accompanying China’s rise as a manufacturing power, and the ‘fissuring’ of the workplace, wherein less-educated workers no longer
share in the gains from rising productivity and profitability in the core activities of their employers (Card, 1996; Lee, 1999; Autor et al., 2013; Weil, 2014; Autor et al., 2016). Literature
4

has shown that all of these factors are important. My focus here, however, is on one economic force that stands at the intersection of technological progress and worker productivity:
occupational change. It is well understood that the structure of work in industrialized countries has polarized, with employment increasingly concentrated in high-education, high-wage
occupations and low-education, low-wage occupations, at the expense of traditionally middleskill career jobs (Autor et al., 2006, 2008; Goos and Manning, 2007; Autor, 2013; Michaels
et al., 2013; Goos et al., 2014). Less widely recognized is the tight connection between this
polarization and the changing structure of work and wages across geographic regions.3 While
the polarization of the occupational structure has unfolded smoothly over four decades, it
has not unfolded evenly across places. In the decades following WWII, there was a steep,
positive urban gradient in the skill level and wage level of non-college jobs: Non-college urban
adults disproportionately held middle-skill, blue-collar production and white-collar office, administrative, and clerical jobs. Because these workers labored in close collaboration with the
high-skill, urban professional, managerial, and technical workers who oversaw factories and
offices, middle-skill jobs for non-college workers were prevalent in cities and metropolitan
areas but scarce in suburbs and rural labor markets.4
Starting in the 1970s, however, this distinctive feature of dense labor markets began to
recede. As rising automation and international trade encroached on employment in production, administrative support, and clerical work, the non-college urban occupational skill
gradient diminished and ultimately disappeared. While workers are vastly more educated
and jobs are vastly more skill-intensive in today’s cities compared tofive decades ago, noncollege workers in these places perform substantially less skilled work than they did decades
earlier. Polarization thus reflects an unwinding of the distinctive structure of work in dense
cities and metro areas relative to suburban and rural areas.
I argue here that this unwinding—concretely, the differential polarization of urban labor
markets—has contributed profoundly to the decline of non-college wages documented in
Figure 1. While the analysis here is largely descriptive, I sketch three mechanisms by which
polarization may have contributed to falling non-college wages: It has shunted non-college
workers from middle-skill career occupations that reward specialized and differentiated skills
into traditionally low-education occupations that demand primarily generic skills; it has
3

It has long been understood that cities and skills are deeply entwined (Glaeser and Mare, 2001; Florida,
2002). And to be sure, I am not the first to study differential polarization across places (cf. Autor 2013;
Mazzolari and Ragusa 2013; Akerman et al. 2015.). The primary contribution of this paper is to demonstrate
the centrality of geography to both the prevalence of middle-skill jobs in earlier decades and to their steep
decline in recent decades.
4
Of course non-college workers in both urban and non-urban labor markets performed traditionally loweducation, low-wage manual labor, transportation, construction, and in-person service jobs. Distinctively,
many non-college workers in urban labor markets held middle-skill jobs.

5

disproportionately depressed middle-wage employment among non-college workers in urban
labor markets, thus directly reducing average non-college wages and—to a startling degree—
attenuating the urban non-college wage premium that prevailed in earlier decades; and it has
created an excess supply of less-educated workers that serves to depress non-college wages
across occupations and geographic areas.
The paper proceeds as follows: Section 1 describes the advance of occupational polarization over four decades, documents the disproportionate prevalence of this polarization among
non-college workers, and presents initial evidence that this aggregate phenomenon can partly
account for falling non-college wages. Section 2 reports a key new result: Wage polarization
has been disproportionately urban and reflects the undoing of a previously robust urban occupational skill gradient among non-college workers. Complementing this evidence, Section 3
documents the striking secular decline in the urban wage premium among non-college workers, and shows how the urban concentration of occupational polarization further contributes
to the falling wages of non-college workers. Section 4 concludes by asking whether the growth
of new urban occupations will lead to a renaissance of urban middle-skill work.

Occupational Polarization

1.1

The big picture

Figure 3 depicts the familiar polarization of the occupational structure of the U.S. labor
market that has unfolded over the course of more than four decades. The nine exhaustive and mutually exclusive occupational categories depicted in this figure are ordered from
lowest to highest by mean log wage level. These nine categories are further clustered into
three broad occupational groups depicted in distinct colors: service and manual occupations;
production, office, administrative, and sales occupations; and technical, professional, and
managerial occupations. The ‘barbell’ shape of this figure reflects the secular bifurcation
of the occupational structure in the U.S. (and many other industrial economies) into higheduction, high-wage professional, managerial, and technical occupations, on the one hand,
and non-credentialed and typically low-paid service and laborer occupations on the other
(see Autor et al. 2006; Goos and Manning 2007; Goos et al. 2014; Autor 2015; Acemoglu and
Restrepo 2017; Alabdulkareem et al. 2018).5
5

Plotted bars correspond to the proportional change in the share of employment in each category; smaller
categories can have large growth rates without accounting for a large change in employment and vice versa
for larger categories.

Figure 3: Percent Changes in Occupational Employment Shares among Working Age Adults, 1970
- 2016

Data source is as in Figure 1. Sample consists of all persons aged 16 to 64 who reported having worked at
least one week in the earnings years, excluding those in the military. For each individual, hours worked are
the product of usual hours worked per week and the number of weeks worked last year. Individual hours
worked are aggregated using CPS sampling weights. Occupational classifications are harmonized following
Dorn (2009), and updated through 2017. Further details on occupational classification are provided in the
supporting data supplements for the paper.

Figure 4 brings these patterns into sharper focus by aggregating the nine occupation
categories into three broad clusters of manual and service occupations (‘low’ skill);
production, office, and sales occupations (‘middle’ skill); and professional, technical, and
managerial occupations (‘high’ skill). At the start of this interval in 1970, U.S. employment
was roughly evenly divided among these three categories: 31.4 percent of total hours were
in low-skill occupations, 38.4 percent were middle-skill, and 30.2 percent were high-skill.6
Over the subsequent four-and-a-half decades, middle-skill employment fell steeply, from 38.4
to 23.3 percent of hours. This trend might be concerning were it not the case that more
6

In 1980, these shares were 30.3, 36.1, and 33.5 percent, respectively.

7

than the entirety of this fall was offset by a rise in employment in high-skill occupations,
which grew from 30.2 to 46.2 percent of hours. Meanwhile, the share of employment in
low-skill occupations fell by almost a percentage point, from 31.4 to 30.6 percent. Thus, in
aggregate, occupational polarization appears to be a case of the middle-class joining the
upper-class, which is not something that economists should worry about.

Figure 4: Changes in Occupational Employment Shares among Working Age Adults, 1970 - 2016

Data source is as in Figure 1. Sample consists of all persons aged 16 to 64 who reported having worked at
least one week in the earnings years, excluding those in the military. For each individual, hours worked are
the product of usual hours worked per week and the number of weeks worked last year. Individual hours
worked are aggregated using CPS sampling weights. Occupational classifications are harmonized following
Dorn (2009), and updated through 2017. Further details on occupational classification are provided in the
supporting data supplements for the paper.

Figure 5 tempers that conclusion. Among college workers (those with some college or
higher education), occupational movement has been modestly, though not uniformly, upward. Between 1980 and 2016, the fraction of college workers in high-skill occupations rose
8

from 57.2 percent to 60.7 percent, the share in middle-skill occupations fell from 27.1 to
20.2 percent, and the share in low-skill occupations increased from 15.6 to 19.0 percent.7
Thus, occupational polarization among college workers has broken roughly evenly between
reallocation toward traditionally high- and low-skill jobs.
Among non-college workers (those with high school or lower education), the picture is
radically different. In 1980, employment of non-college workers was roughly split between
low- and middle-skill occupations, with 42 percent in the former category, 43 percent in the
latter, and the remaining 15 percent in high-skill occupations. Over the ensuing decades,
the share of non-college employment in middle-skill occupations fell by 14 percentage points,
from 43 to 29 percent, while the share in high-skill occupations very slightly increased, from
15.4 to 16.8 percent. Thus, the remaining 12.3 percentage points of decline in non-college
middle-skill employment is explained by the movement of non-college workers from middleskill into traditionally low-skill work. This is a qualitatively large change, and I will argue
next that it has been economically consequential.8
A foundational assumption of the modern literature on skill demand, dating at least
to Tinbergen (1974), is that technological progress complements—and hence raises demand
for—educated workers. This framing might suggest that highly-educated workers should
see their work transformed by technology. While this transformation has to some degree
occurred, a clear takeaway from this descriptive analysis is that changes in the nature of
work—many of which are technological in origin—have been far more profound and, arguably,
far more disruptive for less-educated workers than they have been for more-educated workers.
In broad strokes, the work performed by college adults has changed little over four decades.
While they perform fewer middle-skill jobs than four decades earlier, this contraction has been
modest, and it has been substantially offset by their upward movement in the occupational
hierarchy. Among non-college workers, conversely, polarization has exerted pressure almost
exclusively downward: Almost all occupational change among non-college workers reflects a
movement from the middle toward the bottom of the occupational distribution. Thus, not
only has technology change been transformational, it has been broadly deskilling—by which
I mean that it has narrowed the set of jobs in which non-college workers perform specialized
work that historically (and currently, as I show below) commanded higher pay levels.
7

When splitting the data according to educational attainment, I focus on the period from 1980 forward
because incompatibilities in Census occupational codes between 1970 and 1980 are greatly amplified when
the data are split by education.
8
Although somewhat counterintuitive, it is not a violation of adding up for the low-skill share to rise
among both college and non-college workers and yet fall in aggregate. The resolution is that college workers
are much less likely than non-college workers at all times to work in low-skill occupations, and the fraction
of college versus non-college workers is rising throughout this period.

1.2

A simple calibration

A natural question that follows from the data above is whether occupational change can
in part explain the sharp, post-1980 divergence in real wages by education seen in Figure
1. To explore that question, I perform a simple partial-equilibrium calculation to construct
counterfactual wage series in which I hold the occupational wage structure fixed at its 1978
level while allowing the distribution of workers by education and gender to shift across occupations as observed in the data.9 Formally, we can write the change in the mean log wage
9

The precise interval of this calculation, 1978-2016, is determined by occupational comparability at the
start of the interval and by the need to take centered means across three years to smooth the series. The last

where the αjkt terms correspond to the fraction of group j workers employed in occupation k
in year t, while ωjkt is their mean log wage in that occupation and year.10 Manipulating this
expression, I calculate a counterfactual wage series for each education group j that isolates
the occupational change component (the ∆α terms) while holding the wage structure (ωjkto )
X
terms fixed.

Figure 6 reports estimates of ∆w̃jτ , alongside observed changes in mean log real hourly
wages, by education group for earnings years 1978 through 2016. Superficially, this exercise
appears to capture the general evolution of wages by education group. It clearly captures the
fanning out of wage levels by education group, the fall in real wages of non-college workers,
and also the notable divergence between earnings of college graduates and those with a postcollege degree throughout this period–and particularly after the late 1990s. Closer inspection
reveals two substantive disjunctures. A first is that the actual figure shows considerable real
wage growth among workers with a college degree and higher, something that is absent from
the counterfactual series. In part, this divergence is an artifact: since real wages used in the
exercise are fixed at their 1978 levels, the counterfactual series omits any wage-augmenting
productivity growth that occurs in the ensuing three decades.
The more serious departure between the series is evident from comparing the y-axis ranges
of the two series: the y-range of the observed series is five times the range of the counterfactual
series, meaning that the counterfactual series is qualitatively on target but quantitatively way
off. Hence, changes in occupational composition alone cannot explain (most of) the evolution
of between-group wage inequality in these three decades. This conclusion should not come
as a surprise. An occupation is not a labor market—hence changes in labor demand in
one occupation should affect wages in other occupations. A general decline in demand for
non-college workers in production and clerical jobs—occupations that employed 43 percent
of non-college workers in 1978—should reduce non-college wages both by inducing displaced
workers to take lower paid service and manual jobs and by placing downward supply pressure
on the equilibrium wage of non-college workers generally. Thus, this partial equilibrium
year of data, 2017, is subsumed in the 2016 mean.
10
The twelve occupational categories that comprise this calculation (and are used throughout the paper)
are, from low to high mean wages: Agriculture and mining; Health services; Personal services; Cleaning and
protective services; Construction and mechanics; Transportation; Production and operatives; Clerical and
administrative support; Retail sales minus financial and advertising; Technicians, fire and police; Professionals
plus financial and advertising sales; Managers and executives. In implementing this calculation, I further
allow mean log wages and employment shares to differ by gender within education groups j.

11

exercise arguably provides a (loose) lower bound on the extent to which the reallocation
of non-college labor from middle- to low-skill occupations could potentially affect wages for
non-college workers.

Data source is as in Figure 1. Each data point is a three-year centered average of the mean log wage for
the relevant education group using earnings years 1977 - 2017. Series are normalized to zero in 1978. See
equation (1) and body text for details of construction.

This is not the end of the story, however. The exercise above implicitly assumes that
the decline of middle-skill occupations has occurred at the average (log) wage level within
each occupation-education-gender group.11 While this is a reasonable baseline assumption,
it would be violated if the marginal declining (or growing) job within an occupation differed
from the average of that occupation. One scenario in which this would arise is if the decline
of middle-wage occupations were particularly concentrated in cities and metro areas where
wage levels are consistently higher. As I show in the next two sections, this scenario, in large
part,is what has played out over the last four decades.
11

This assumption is built into the ωjkto terms in equation (1). Since these terms correspond to the mean
(start-of-period) wage in each occupation × education × gender cell, they do not admit within-cell wage
heterogeneity.

2

The geography of polarization

The structure of work differs across places: local labor markets are often specialized in particular industries and services such as manufacturing, education, entertainment, or healthcare.
One of the key predictors of occupational structure is population density. Some activities
intrinsically take place in low-density areas, such as agriculture. U.S. manufacturing was concentrated in large cities at the start of the twentieth century, and it slowly migrated towards
less dense areas as transportation networks improved (Glaeser, 2011). Knowledge-intensive
industries tend to locate in cities, where educated workers are most prevalent (Glaeser and
Mare, 2001; Moretti, 2004; Berry and Glaeser, 2005). These regularities suggest that occupational structure should vary systematically with population density—if so, the expansion
or contraction of specific industries and occupations would be expected to have non-neutral
impacts on the structure of occupations across urban, metropolitan, suburban, and rural
areas. As it turns out, these simple regularities apply with startling clarity to the evolving
occupational geography of U.S. labor markets.
Figure 7 presents a bin-scatter depicting the aggregate relationship between population
density and occupational structure at the level of commuting zones (CZs) covering the contiguous U.S. states over the course of the five-and-a-half decades between 1970 and 2015.
The three panels of this figure report the CZ-level share of employment among working-age
adults in the three broad occupational categories referenced previously: services, transportation, laborer, and construction workers (‘low skill’); clerical, administrative support, sales,
and production workers (‘mid skill’); and professional, technical, and managerial workers
(‘high skill’).12 The run variable in this and subsequent figures is the natural log of population density (i.e., number of residents divided by CZ land area). To enforce consistency
of CZ rankings across time permits, I use each CZ’s population density in 1970 as the run
variable throughout. The data are weighted by the count of working-age adults in each CZ.
Hence, each plotted point in the bin-scatter represents approximately 5 percent of all workers
in each year.
Figure 7 strongly reinforces the conclusion that the decline of middle-skill employment is
fully absorbed by a simultaneous rise in high-skill employment—that is, there is essentially
no aggregate change in the share of workers employed in traditionally low-skill jobs over the
course of 45 years. This figure also conveys three fresh insights. First, while denser CZs
have traditionally been more intensive in high-skill work, the level and slope of this densityskill-intensity relationship rose consistently over multiple decades. In 1970, for example, the
12

In each panel, I subtract off the overall working age mean share of employment in the relevant occupational
category in 1970, so plotted points correspond to the CZ’s share of employment in the occupational cluster
relative to the aggregate mean share in that cluster in 1970.

13

high-skill occupation share in the densest CZs was about five percentage points above the
corresponding share in the least dense CZs. By 2015, this gap had increased to approximately
fifteen percentage points. Second, the fraction of workers engaged in low-skill occupations
has historically been considerably smaller in high-density CZs, and this gradient has changed
little over decades. From 1970 through 2000, the low-skill occupation share was consistently
20 percentage points lower in the most versus least dense CZs, after which the fraction of
low-skill work in the densest CZs rose by several percentage points over the next 15 years.

American Community Survey (ACS) data for years 2014 through 2016, sourced from IPUMS Ruggles et al.
(2018). Occupational classifications are harmonized across decades using the classification scheme developed
by Dorn (2009) and distilled to the level of 722 consistent local labor markets (AKA, Commuting Zones)
following the procedures in Autor and Dorn (2013). Each plotted point represents approximately 5 percent
of the working-age population in the relevant year.

Perhaps most strikingly, Figure 7 reveals that denser CZs were exceptional in the 1970s
in having far more middle-skill work than suburban and rural CZs. But this exceptional
feature attenuated and subsequently reversed sign over the next four decades. In 1970,
there was a strong positive density gradient in middle-skill employment, with an urban-rural
difference of approximately 15 percentage points in the share of workers engaged in clerical,
14

administrative, sales, and production work. This gradient sharply eroded between 1970 and
1990 and eventually reversed sign—from positive to negative—over the subsequent 25 years.
While middle-skill work was differentially present in cities and metro areas in the 1970s, it
was differentially absent from those locales 45 years later and less prevalent everywhere in
absolute terms.
Since Figure 7 shows that the urban expansion of high-skill occupations has almost precisely offset the urban contraction of middle-skill occupations, this figure appears to convey
the march of workers up the occupational skill ladder. We know, however, from Figure 5
that this aggregate pattern masks strong compositional shifts within education groups—
specifically, an increase in the share of non-college workers employed in historically low-skill
occupations. The two panels of Figure 8 show how this reallocation of labor across occupations has unfolded across geographic areas. The upper panel of this figure shows that there
has been almost no increase in the share of college adults (i.e., those with some college or
more) employed in high-skill professional, technical, and managerial occupations.13 There
was, however, a modest decline of about eight percentage points over 45 years in the share
of college workers working in middle-skill occupations and a commensurate rise in the share
working in low-skill occupations; moreover, this shift was most pronounced in denser CZs.
Occupational polarization among non-college workers has, however, been far more dramatic, as shown in the lower panel of Figure 5. At no point from (at least) 1970 forward was
there any meaningful density gradient in high-skill work among non-college workers. But
there was a steep density gradient in middle-skill work. In 1970, non-college workers in the
densest CZs were approximately 25 percentage points more likely to work in middle-skill
occupations (and 25 percentage points less likely to work in low-skill occupations) than were
non-college workers in low density CZs. This gradient became shallower and its intercept
fell over the ensuing 45 years. By 2015, the low-skill employment share among non-college
workers was several points higher in the most versus least dense CZs, while the middle-skill
employment share was correspondingly several points lower.
13

Of course, the fraction of college adults has risen substantially (see Figure 2), so no decline in the
prevalence of high-skill work among this group implies a substantial increase in the share of workers in high
skill occupations.

16

Thus, the decline of middle-skill occupations has meant a profound reallocation of noncollege workers in urban and metro areas from middle-skill production and office work to
low-skill services, transportation, and laborer occupations. This reallocation has been so
sweeping that nothing remains of the density gradient in middle-skill work for non-college
workers that was strongly evident just four decades earlier.14

2.1

Polarization and immigration

The urban workforce is disproportionately college-educated and foreign-born, and it has
become more so over time. Figure 9 illustrates the rising urban gradient in college degree
holding that is noted by multiple scholars (Costa and Kahn, 2000; Glaeser and Mare, 2001;
Florida, 2002; Moretti, 2013; Diamond, 2016). In 1970, working-age adults in the densest CZs
were approximately five percentage points more likely to hold a four-year (or higher) degree
than were those in the least dense CZs. This gap rose to 15 percentage points between 1970
and 1990. By 2015, it had risen further to approximately 25 percentage points. There was
no analogous urban-rural divergence in the distribution of the least-educated adults. While
the high school dropout share of the working-age adult population fell by approximately twothirds between 1970 and 2015 (see Figure 2), the rural-urban gap in the high school dropout
share was little changed. In net, the educational distribution in high-density CZs has become
increasingly right-skewed but it has not become increasingly left-skewed.15
Figure 10 depicts the second differentiating feature of urban labor markets alluded to
above: the rise in immigrant intensity. In 2015, the rural-urban gap in the foreign-born
share of college adults was approximately 35 percentage points, roughly twice as large as
in 1970. Similarly, the rural-urban gap in the foreign-born share of non-college adults was
approximately 25 percentage points in 2015, again roughly double the gap in 1970. Foreignborn workers in turn have a bimodal education distribution: they are disproportionately likely
to either have completed post-baccalaureate education or to lack a high school diploma.16
14

These findings are consistent Frank Morgan R. et al. (2018), who document that as of 2014, small U.S.
cities were substantially less specialized in hard-to-automate managerial and technical professional occupations than are larger cities, and thus face greater potential impacts from automation.
15
Employing the simple college/non-college classification used above (i.e., college refers to some college
or above and non-college refers to high school graduate or below), the data suggest even less of an overall
educational divergence. The urban-rural divide in working-age college residents rose from approximately
5 percentage points in 1970 to 10 percentage points in 2015, while the urban-rural divide in non-college
residents fell by the same amount. This is not a dramatic change.
16
Using the pooled 2014 - 2016 ACS files, I find that 12.2 percent of foreign-born versus 10.7 percent of
U.S. born working-age adults had a post-college education in 2015, and 23.1 percent of foreign-born versus
10.5 percent of U.S. born working-age adults lacked a high school diploma.

Each plotted point represents approximately 5 percent of the working-age population in the relevant year.

These observations raise the possibility that the shifting density gradient in occupational
structure is in part an artifact of the increasingly bimodal educational and nativity structure
of denser CZs. I explore this possibility by plotting changes in occupational composition by
population density separately for native-born and foreign-born non-college workers in Figure
11. This figure makes clear that occupational polarization has been equally pronounced
among foreign-born and native-born non-college adults. And among both groups, the decline
of middle-skill employment and the rise of low-skill employment has been steeper in denser
CZs.17 Appendix Figure A2 further shows that the overall patterns of occupational change are
highly comparable among foreign- and native-born college adults. Polarization is therefore
not concentrated among foreign-born workers. While one could postulate a more complex
dynamic in which rising urban immigration leads to occupational polarization among both
non-college natives and non-college immigrants, this story runs counter to the influential
17

Though the fall in the urban gradient in middle skill work has been even steeper for U.S.-born than
foreign-born workers, the overall decline is about equally large for both groups.

18

finding in Peri and Sparber (2009) that rising immigrant penetration catalyzes occupational
upgrading among similarly educated natives. It therefore seems unlikely that simple supplyside factors such as immigration can explain the polarization of urban employment.

2.2

The decline of urban production, clerical, and administrative
occupations

Much evidence suggests that the pronounced polarization of urban employment likely stems
from two secular demand-side forces: (1) the decline of manufacturing production work in
the face of advancing automation and rising trade pressure and (2) the proliferation of office
computing that has hollowed out the ranks of clerical and administrative workers (Autor
and Dorn, 2013; Autor et al., 2016; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2017). I suspect that the latter
force has been particularly significant for non-college workers, who performed the relatively
routine subset of office clerical tasks. Both phenomena are visible in Figure 12, which plots
the shrinking employment shares of non-college workers in production work and in administrative and clerical work between 1970 and 2015. In 1970, production employment followed
an inverted-U in population density—strongly increasing in density through most of the distribution, but tailing off sharply in the densest CZs, reflecting the secular suburbanization of
manufacturing (Glaeser, 2011). Between 1970 and 1990, the production employment share of
non-college workers fell by at least 10 percentage points in mid-size metropolitan areas and
then fell by approximately that amount again over the next 25 years. By 2015, there was
almost no density gradient remaining in production employment: manufacturing was scarce
in rural areas (as always), even scarcer in the densest urban areas, and just a few percentage
points higher in mid-density CZs.18
The analogous pattern of declining non-college clerical and administrative employment
begins later in this time interval but culminates even more starkly. In 1970, the share of
non-college workers in clerical and administrative occupations was 15-plus percentage points
higher in the most versus least dense CZs. Though not shown in the figure, this relationship
was essentially unchanged between 1970 and 1980. With the advent of ubiquitous office
computing in the 1980s, clerical and administrative employment among non-college workers
fell steeply. This decline was already apparent by 1990 and accelerated thereafter. By 2015,
there was almost no remaining (positive) density gradient in office work among non-college
workers. Logically, this trend was even steeper among women, with a fall of 25 percentage
points in the share of non-college women in office work in the densest CZs between 1970 and
2015 (Appendix Figure A1).
In sum, this evidence underscores how much the secular decline in middle-skill employment has reflected the reversal of a distinctive, long-standing feature of urban versus nonurban areas: the employment of less-educated workers in more skill-intensive occupations. It
has, of course, long been recognized that less-educated workers earn higher wages in urban
18
The fall of production employment has been much steeper among non-college men than women, consistent
with expectations (see Appendix Figure A1).

21

areas (Glaeser and Mare, 2001; Moretti, 2004). What was previously unknown is that noncollege workers performed distinctly different—more skilled—work in metro and urban labor
markets. The erosion of this occupational skill gradient over recent decades, particularly in
the 2000s, may in turn augur a fall in the non-college urban wage premium.

Polarization and the urban wage premium

It is a robust empirical regularity that urban workers earn more than observably similar
non-urban workers (Glaeser and Mare, 2001; Moretti, 2004; Glaeser and Resseger, 2010).
Given that land prices are intrinsically higher in dense locations, it is logical that higher
urban wages compensate workers for the higher cost of urban living (holding amenities con22

stant). For this to be an equilibrium, however, the productivity of urban workers must also
be commensurately higher; otherwise, firms would locate elsewhere. These basic observations
imply that some set of agglomerative forces—for example, market thickness, ready exchange
of ideas, or external economies of scale—must generate higher productivity in urban areas,
ideas that have received extensive empirical study (see Glaeser and Gottlieb 2009). While
the underlying productive forces behind urban agglomerations are not fully understood, it is
easy to imagine how these forces might arise for high skill workers: In knowledge-intensive
work, in-person interactions appear to have few close substitutes, meaning that proximity is
critical to productivity (Gaspar and Glaeser, 1998; Glaeser and Resseger, 2010). It is less obvious, however, why these productivity spillovers accrue to low-skill workers. One possibility
suggested by the evidence above is that, in past decades, less-educated workers performed
higher-skilled work in urban areas: specifically production, clerical, and administrative jobs.
Although the productivity of non-college production and office workers may or may not have
been directly augmented by urban siting, their work was necessarily colocated alongside the
highly-educated knowledge workers who oversaw it. This geographic complementarity could
plausibly generate a positive occupational and wage density gradient for non-college workers.
These observations, if correct, imply that the secular decline of middle-skill urban occupations could have served to depress the urban wage premium among non-college workers.19 I
investigate this possibility here.

3.1

The fading non-college urban wage premium

Figure 13 provides strong confirmation that the urban non-college wage premium has in fact
declined steeply over the course of several decades, most dramatically after 2000.20 To my
knowledge, this pattern has largely escaped notice in the literature, with the important recent
exception of Baum-Snow et al. (2018), discussed below.21 While it is tempting to attribute
this declining premium to wage structure shifts in urban vs. non-urban labor markets, it could
alternatively be driven by a number of compositional changes in these markets, including age
structure, educational composition of the broad ‘non-college’ category, lingering after-effects
of the Great Recession, and immigrant penetration. I explore these confounds in succession,
starting with age structure.
19

One would nevertheless expect a modest urban non-college wage gradient to compensate workers for
higher urban living costs, and this appears present in the data.
20
This is opposite in sign to the steeply rising urban wage premium among college workers reported by
Diamond (2016) and hence does not reflect a general decline in urban wages.
21
Ironically, Baum-Snow et al.’s work had escaped my notice prior to obtaining the results above. Given
that they seem to run against the grain of recent literature on urban inequality (see for example Diamond
2016, Table 8, indicating that rising college worker productivity in cities raises non-college wages), it is
reassuring that this pattern is independently documented elsewhere.

Autor and Fournier (2019) report a pronounced inversion of the relationship between
population density and population age in the U.S. over the last six decades. Given that the
college/non-college wage premium typically rises over the lifecycle (Card and Lemieux,
2001), the shifting age composition of urban vs. non-urban CZs could potentially skew raw
comparisons of college vs. non-college wages. Figure 14 confronts this concern by plotting
college and non-college wages for subcategories of prime-age workers ages 25 to 39 and 40
to 54. The falling urban non-college wage premium is clearly evident within these groups of
prime-age workers.

Given the coarseness of the college and non-college education categories, a further concern is that changes in the non-college urban wage gradient could in part reflect changes in
the composition of educational attainment within these broad buckets. Figure 15 explores
this possibility by plotting wage gradients separately for five detailed education categories:
high school dropouts, high school graduates, some college, four-year degree, and post-college
educated. The falling urban non-college wage premium is highly visible within subgroups of
workers with less than a four-year college education, particularly among high school dropouts
and high school graduates, but also among those with some college. Apparently, the declining non-college urban wage premium is not an artifact of the aggregation of educational
categories.
A separate concern is that the declining non-college urban wage premium might primarily
reflect a lingering consequence of the Great Recession. Figure 15 addresses this concern by
presenting panels for both the pre-recession year of 2007 and the post-recession year of 2015.
As is evident in the figure and detailed in Appendix Tables A1 through A3, the fall in the
urban wage premium for non-college workers commences well before the Great Recession
(indeed, it is visible by 1990) and becomes cumulatively more pronounced.22 Appendix
Figure A5 further documents that the non-college urban wage premium was as at least as
steep in the 1950s as in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s—so, the post-1990 decline is recent and
atypical. Appendix Figures A3 and A4 further document that the decline is equally prevalent
among men and women and, in keeping with the evidence above, visible among both foreignborn and native-born workers (see also Appendix Tables A4 and A5). I conclude that the
falling premium is unlikely to be a compositional artifact.
The declining non-college urban wage premium was (to my knowledge) first reported by
Baum-Snow et al. (2018) in their study of the causes of rising urban wage inequality from 1980
through 2007.23 Fitting a structural model that admits both capital skill-complementarity
and urban agglomeration, Baum-Snow et al. (2018) estimate that cities and skills have become more complementary over time—formally, agglomerative forces for skilled workers have
risen—which can rationalize the rising urban college wage premium and falling non-college
22

Wage estimates for the year 1950, reported in the appendix tables though excluded from figures for clarity,
confirm that the non-college urban wage gradient was at least as steep in that decade as the corresponding
gradient among college workers. Thus, the fall in the non-college urban wage gradient after 1990 reflects a
sharp departure from the prior four decades.
23
Use the same IPUMS source data used here (though for a shorter time interval), Baum-Snow et al. (2018)
find that not only did the urban wage gradient rise for workers with college or higher education over the last
several decades (as is well known), it fell between 1990 and 2000 among workers with high school or lower
education. Their measure of economic geography and urban/non-urban differ slightly from those used here:
Baum-Snow et al. use Core-Based Statistical Areas rather than Commuting Zones as geographies, and they
measure urbanicity using CBSA log population rather than CZ log population density.

wage premium. In related work, Giannone (2018) employs a structural model to interpret
the decline of regional wage convergence among U.S. cities after 1980. Like Baum-Snow et al.
(2018), Giannone concludes that wage divergence among skilled workers across locations is
driven by rising agglomerative forces for skilled labor that, in the model, interact positively
with skill-biased technical change.24

Figure is constructed using U.S. Census of Population data for 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and pooled American Community Survey (ACS) data for years 2006 through 2008 and for 2014 through 2016, sourced from
IPUMS Ruggles et al. (2018). Occupational classifications are harmonized across decades using the classification scheme developed by Dorn (2009) and distilled to the level of consistent local labor markets (AKA,
Commuting Zones) following the procedures in Autor and Dorn (2013). Each plotted point represents approximately 3.3 percent of the working age population in the relevant year.

The evidence here complements these inferences by identifying a reason why agglomerative forces may have diverged among skill groups—specifically, the withering of the urban
occupational skill gradient among non-college workers. This gradient was a vital feature

Giannone notes that regional wage divergence has occurred among high but not low-skill workers. She
does not report a decline in the urban low-skill wage premium.

27

of U.S. economic geography in 1970. It declined modestly in that decade, eroded far more
rapidly in the 1980s and 1990s, and was completely absent by 2015.25 Distinct from earlier decades, non-college workers now perform essentially the same work in both urban and
non-urban labor markets: custodial work, food services, protective services, recreation, and
health services; transportation services; and laborer occupations. The agglomerative forces
that plausibly contributed to the steep non-college urban wage gradient in earlier decades
appear to have substantially attenuated.26
One supplementary piece of evidence that lends support to this interpretation is the
evolution of wages among non-college workers in high-, medium-, and low-skill occupations
in the intervening decades. As shown in Appendix Figure A6, the urban wage gap between
high- and medium-skill occupations expanded over recent decades while, simultaneously, the
urban wage gap between medium- and low-skill occupations contracted, especially for men.
These patterns are consistent with falling relative demand for middle-skill work in cities and
metro areas. This suggestive evidence should be read cautiously, however. As noted above,
an occupation is not a labor market. Similarly, urban and non-urban wage structures are
not independent since they are linked by worker migration and firm arbitrage. It would
be premature to conclude that the collapse of middle-skill urban employment explains the
flattening of the urban non-college wage premium. Clearly, this is a ripe topic for theoretical
and empirical exploration.

3.2

Accounting for the geography of polarization: Wage implications

I hypothesized above that, by shunting non-college workers into traditionally low-skill occupations, the ongoing encroachment of occupational polarization may in part explain the
perplexing fall in real wages of non-college workers over the last three decades. Given the
evidence in Section 3 that occupational polarization has disproportionately occurred in highwage urban and metro labor markets, it appears likely that the geography of polarization has
magnified its wage impacts. I explore this possibility by using the kernel density reweighting
technique of DiNardo et al. (1996, DFL hereafter) to answer the following question: How
25

This gradient appears even more pronounced in 1950 than in 1970, but incompatibilities across historical
occupational classification schemes reduce my confidence in this inference. Supplementary plots are available
from the author.
26
These findings may also help to address the puzzling decline of low-skill migration towards high-income
U.S. states explored in Ganong and Shoag (2017). Their work attributes this decline to steep increases
in housing prices and housing regulations in wealthy regions that increasingly deter new low-skill entrants.
The above results suggest a complementary explanation: the flattening urban non-college wage gradient has
reduced the incentive for low-skill workers to move to high-income cities.

28

would the wages of college and non-college workers have changed between 1970 and 2015 had
occupational composition and occupational geography evolved as observed while wage levels
by occupation and location are held fixed at their 1970 levels.27 This partial equilibrium
clearly abstracts from the many economic forces causing wages to evolve within occupations
and across places during the intervening decades; concretely, it varies quantities while holding
prices fixed. In this application, however, I suspect that this exercise systematically underestimates the contribution of occupational change to wage changes by skill group—particularly
for the non-college workers who are my focus.
Following DiNardo et al. (1996), I write the observed wage distribution f (w) in year t0
as the joint distribution of wages w and covariates x (i.e,. education, occupation, sex, and
location) integrated over the domain of covariates in year t0 , denoted as Ωx :
Z
ft0 (w) =
dF (w, x|tw,x = t0 ) .
x∈Ωx

Iterating expectations, this can be rewritten as
Z
xt0
fwt0 (w) = f (w|x, tw = t0 ) dF (x|tx = t0 ) .
Here, the distribution of w is conditioned on x and the distribution of x is conditioned on
t0 , as indicated by the subscript and superscript, respectively. Using this identity, we can
substitute in the x distribution from a subsequent time period, t1 :
Z
xt 1
fwt0 (w) = f (w|x, tw = t0 ) dF (x|tx = t1 )
Z
= f (w|x, tw = t0 ) dF (x|tx = t1 ) ψx (x) dF (x|tz = t0 ) .
In this expression, the function ψx (x) = dF (x|tx = t1 ) /dF (x|tx = t0 ) reweights the distribution of covariates in period t0 to match those in t1 (i.e., quantities change). The conditional
distribution of wages given covariates x is meanwhile held at its start of period (t0 ) level (i.e.,
prices are held fixed).28
Figure 16 reports the results of this reweighting exercise. The first panel reports the
familiar pattern of wage inequality in these decades: Real and relative wages of collegeeducated workers fall between 1970 and 1980 (see Katz and Murphy 1992), then rise steeply
over the next three and a half decades, until the onset of the Great Recession; real wages
of workers with high school or lower education drop steeply during the 1980s and modestly
rebound during the 1990s, though high school dropout wages have not regained their 1980
27

DFL generalizes the venerable Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition from decomposing wage means to decomposing wage distributions.
28
In practice, estimating the odds ratio for each value of a high-dimensional vector is fraught with indeterminacies. Following DFL, I invert the problem using Bayes’ Rule to write ψbx = [Pr (tx = t1 |x) / Pr (tx = t0 |x)]×
[Pr (tx = t0 ) / Pr (tx = t1 )] , which I estimate with a logit model.

level even 35 years later. The second panel shows the effect of reweighting the 1970 wage distribution to reflect the subsequent occupational distribution during each subsequent decade
(1980, 1990, 2000, 2007, and 2015).29 Consistent with the reweighting exercise presented in
Section 1 above, Figure 16 shows that occupational reallocation can proximately account for
a substantial share of the fall in non-college wages over this time interval.

Figure is constructed using U.S. Census of Population data for 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and pooled American Community Survey (ACS) data for years 2006 through 2008 and for 2014 through 2016, sourced from
IPUMS Ruggles et al. (2018). Occupational classifications are harmonized across decades using the classification scheme developed by Dorn (2009) and distilled to the level of consistent local labor markets (AKA,
Commuting Zones) following the procedures in Autor and Dorn (2013). The first panel reports cumulative
changes in real log hourly wages by education group for years 1970 - 2015. The second panel reports a DFL
reweighting exercise where the 1970 conditional wage distribution is reweighted to match the employment
distribution across the twelve occupational categories used above in each subsequent post-1970 period. The
third panel repeats this exercise while reweighting the 1970 conditional wage distribution to match the subsequent occupation distribution and the geographic distribution of occupations in each major category (low-,
middle-, and high-skill) across more vs. less dense commuting zones.

29

I use the same twelve broad occupation categories as applied in Figure 6 and discussed in footnote 10
for each of five education groups. This exercise does not distinguish between male and female workers within
each occupation by education cell.

30

The third panel of Figure 16 additionally considers the contribution of occupational geography to changing wage structure. Here, I reweight the 1970 wage distribution to reflect
subsequent changes in occupational structure and subsequent changes in the locations where
high-, medium-, and low-skill work occurs by adding to the reweighting vector interaction
terms between 1970 log CZ population density and three broad occupation dummies corresponding to low-, middle-, and high-skill occupations as defined above. Accounting for the
geography of polarization substantially adds to the explanatory power of this exercise. As is
visible in the figure, it can now account for the entirety of the fall in wages of high school
dropouts and high school graduates. Consistent with the fact that polarization has occurred
disproportionately among urban, non-college workers, reweighting the 1970 wage distribution
to account for the changing geography of occupations magnifies the estimated adverse impact
of occupational polarization on wages of non-college workers but has essentially no effect on
the wages of college workers.
As with the earlier reweighting exercise in 6, this simulation cannot account for the rising
real wages of highly educated workers. Mechanically, there has been only modest occupational
change among college workers, so occupational reweighting has little impact. Substantively,
holding the 1970 wage distribution fixed over the next 45 years omits all productivity growth
among highly-educated workers—frequently referred to as ’skill biased technical change’—
that has occurred in the interim. More fundamentally, this exercise abstracts from all supply
and demand forces that affect wage levels within and between occupations. It likely understates the downward pressure that polarization places on wages in low-skill occupations
by inducing would-be middle-skill workers to bid for historically low-skill jobs. Similarly,
it neglects the impact that rising demand for high-skill workers—seen in the rapid growth
of professional, technical, and managerial occupations—exerts on college wages across all
occupational categories.

Conclusion: Where is the land of opportunity?

Labor markets in U.S. cities today are vastly more educated and skill-intensive than they were
five decades ago. Yet, urban non-college workers perform substantially less skilled work than
decades earlier, and the once robust non-college urban wage premium has largely flat-lined.
The evidence presented here offers a circumstantial case that the hollowing out of middleskill, non-college blue-collar production and white-collar administrative support jobs, which
were once abundant in dense urban labor markets, provides at least a partial explanation for
these adverse trends in the composition and remuneration of non-college employment.
A critical question that remains unanswered by this evidence is whether a countervailing
31

set of economic forces will soon reverse the decline of middle-skill work, and thereby possibly
restore the steep urban occupational skill and wage escalator that afforded greater opportunities to non-college workers in prior decades. Theoretical work by Acemoglu and Restrepo
(2018) posits one such set of countervailing forces: increased labor abundance stemming from
labor-displacing automation yields an incentive for firms to develop new labor-using tasks
that ‘reinstate’ labor’s comparative advantage in a broader range of tasks. Consistent with
the arguments of Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018), pioneering work by Lin (2011) documents
that ‘new work’—concretely, the creation of new Census occupational titles—is concentrated
in cities (see also Berger and Frey, 2016). These findings offer some grounds for optimism
about the potential for endogenous technological change to restore labor demand.
Tempering these conclusions, Autor and Salomons (2019) find that new Census occupational titles—as defined by Lin—are themselves strongly polarized among skill categories.
Consistent with Lin (2011), Autor and Salomons identify one rapidly growing set of occupations, which they label ‘frontier jobs,’ that involve producing, installing, maintaining, and
deploying new generations of technologies (e.g., robot integration, search engine optimization, radiological medicine). Census data confirm that these occupations are relatively highly
paid and are disproportionately held by college-educated men. Conversely, Autor and Salomons (2019) document a second category of new occupations, also growing in dense urban
labor markets, that provide labor-intensive, in-person services to affluent consumers, many of
whom reside in high-wage urban labor markets. Examples of these occupations, which Autor
and Salomons term ’wealth work,’ include yoga instruction, sommelier services, pet care, and
many forms of personal training and counseling. Distinct from frontier jobs, most wealth
work is neither technologically novel nor broadly demanding of technical skills. It is also not
highly paid. Workers in wealth work occupations typically earn close to the mean of the wage
distribution within their local labor markets and a disproportionate share are women. Finally, Autor and Salomons document a third category of new work that involves carrying out
nearly-automated tasks that retain a residual set of human components, such as call-center
operators, order fulfillment workers, and data entry clerks. These occupations, which Autor
and Salomons dub ‘last mile’ jobs, are less prevalent in non-urban areas than in urban labor
markets, likely because most do not require face-to-face contact with customers. Perhaps
unsurprisingly, wage and education levels in last mile jobs are typically considerably below
average. In net, these findings support the contention that a disproportionate share of ‘new
work’ is generated within dense urban labor markets. But the bifurcated structure of new
work does not suggest that a technology-driven ’reinstatement’ of middle-skill, non-college
jobs is currently underway.
Where is the land of opportunity for non-college workers? Recent literature that points to

32

dense urban areas as a growth escalator for U.S. productivity and wages laments, accordingly,
the slowing geographic mobility of non-college workers into these locations (see (Moretti,
2015; Ganong and Shoag, 2017; Austin et al., 2018)). The evidence here points in the opposite
direction: the skill escalator that non-college workers once ascended as they entered urban
labor markets has lost elevation. And the slowing inflow of non-college workers into urban
labor markets may reflect less a failure of arbitrage than a fall in the economic allure that
these labor markets once held for less-skilled workers. I view this as a positive development:
the slowing migration of non-college workers into high-wage cities should ultimately boost
low-skill wages in high-skill labor markets. Simultaneously, the disproportionate aging of
suburban and rural U.S. populations during the last four decades (Autor and Fournier, 2019)
augurs rapidly rising demand for certain labor-intensive, low-skill occupations, such as inperson care, transportation, repair, and other services for the non-urban elderly. This secular
demographic change may generate new employment opportunities for non-college workers in
low-density locations, and could further reduce or even reverse the long-standing urban noncollege wage gradient.

Figure is constructed using U.S. Census of Population data for 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000, and pooled
American Community Survey (ACS) data for years 2014 through 2016, sourced from IPUMS Ruggles et al.
(2018). Occupational classifications are harmonized across decades using the classification scheme developed
by Dorn (2009) and distilled to the level of consistent local labor markets (AKA, Commuting Zones) following
the procedures in Autor and Dorn (2013). Each plotted point represents approximately five percent of the
working age population in the relevant year.

Each column of each panel reports a separate log wage regression of log hourly earnings of the indicated
education group on log population density and a constant. N is 722 Commuting Zones in all years except in
1950, where N is 722 in Panels A through C, 711 in Panel D, and 685 in Panel E. Log population density equals
the ratio of residents to land area in the indicated decade, and regressions are weighted by CZ working-age
population in the indicated year. Data sources: U.S. Census of Population data for 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000,

Each column of each panel reports a separate log wage regression of log hourly earnings of the indicated
education group on log population density and a constant. N is 722 Commuting Zones in all years except
in 1950, where N is 722 in Panel A, 721 in Panel B, 712 in Panel C, 652 in Panel D, and 515 in Panel E.
Log population density equals the ratio of residents to land area in the indicated decade, and regressions are
weighted by CZ working-age population in the indicated year. Data sources: U.S. Census of Population data
for 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and pooled American Community Survey (ACS) data for years 2006 through 2008
and for 2014 through 2016 Ruggles et al. (2018).
