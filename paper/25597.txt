ABSTRACT
The common finding of a zero or negative correlation between the presence of children and
parental well-being continues to generate research interest. We here consider over one million
observations on Europeans from ten years of Eurobarometer surveys, and in the first instance
replicate this negative finding, both in the overall data and then for most different marital
statuses. Children are expensive, and controlling for financial difficulties turns almost all of our
estimated child coefficients positive. We argue that financial difficulties explain the pattern of
existing results by parental education and income, and country income and social support. Marital
status matters. Kids do not raise happiness for singles, the divorced, separated or widowed. Last,
we underline that all children are not the same, with step-children commonly having a more
negative correlation than children from the current relationship.

1. Introduction
The empirical analysis of the relationship between the presence of children and parental subjective
well-being has produced a variety of results. While some analyses have found positive correlations,
these do not apply to all parents equally, and other work has concluded as to a negative effect of
children on parental well-being. As Cetre et al. (2016) note, subjective well-being scores are
usually well-behaved, in that they produce estimated coefficients that fit with our predictions; on
the contrary, the estimated coefficients on children do not always fit well with our guess that (at
least for evolutionary reasons) children should produce well-being.
A number of results from the existing literature are discussed in Online Annex 5 of Clark et al.
(2018), available at http://cep.lse.ac.uk/origins/onlinematerial.pdf. These broadly show a
divergence of findings in the cross-sectional literature (with negative estimated coefficients in, for
example, Deaton and Stone, 2014, Alesina et al., 2004, and Stanca, 2012, but small positive
correlations in Aasve et al., 2012, and Cetre et al., 2016). Fixed-effect analysis tends to produce
more positive findings: see Clark et al. (2008), Stutzer and Frey (2006) and Figure 5.6 in Clark et
al. (2018). Kahneman, Krueger, Schkade, Schwarz, and Stone, (2004) found that child care was
only slightly more enjoyable than housework or commuting to work.
While economists in general tend to prefer fixed-effects to cross-section analysis, the former
mechanically tends to focus on young children (due to its requirement that the parent be observed
both before and after the childbirth), and most existing panels are not long enough for us to say
much about the relationship between children and parental well-being in panel analysis when the
former are in their teens or older.1 The effect of children in general may well be different from that
of young children. The lags and leads analysis in Clark et al. (2018) suggest that life satisfaction
rises at birth but then turns negative when the child is aged two. However, the slope in life
satisfaction as the child ages then looks positive (at least for mothers) and it is intriguing to
speculate on what its shape might be as the children age.2 Cross-sectional analysis, on the contrary,
allows us to consider children of all ages.
As well as calculating an average effect of all children, sometimes distinguishing by (young) child
age, it is of interest to ask which parents do better (or worse) as children come around. Existing
work suggests that the relationship between children and parental well-being is more likely to be
positive in richer countries, with one interpretation being that children are more likely to be chosen
there (see McLanahan and Adams, 1987).
Children are also more likely to be associated with higher subjective well-being for older parents:
the positive effects of children in Deaton and Stone, 2014, are found for parents who are aged 34–
46, and in Margolis and Myrskylä (2011) the estimated coefficients on children for those aged
under 30, 30–39, and over 40 are respectively negative, zero and positive (see also Stanca, 2012,
for evidence from the World Values Survey).
1

A similar point applies to the instrumental-variable analysis in Costa-Font et al. (2018), which relies on a 2007
parental-leave reform in Germany. The children here are all fairly young.
2

The length of the SOEP panel does allow Myrskylä and Margolis (2014) to consider the relationship between parental
life satisfaction and a small number of children up to teen ages. They find a positive life-satisfaction effect around
childbirth, but no significant relationship thereafter.
1

With respect to socioeconomic resources, which will be one of our main areas of interest in the
current paper, Margolis and Myrskylä (2011) divide their World Values Survey respondents up
into three income groups, according to their self-reported income decile (Low = deciles 1-4,
Middle = deciles 5-6 and High = deciles 7-10). Although the differences are only small, for the
under-40’s the relationship between children and life satisfaction is more negative for the lowincome group (there is no clear difference in this respect between the middle- and high-income
groups). In the analysis of BHPS and SOEP data in Myrskylä and Margolis (2014), the subjective
well-being trajectory of the higher-educated is above that of less-educated parents (see their Figure
4), although the differences do not appear to be significant.
Glass, Simon, and Andersson (2016) compared the happiness levels of couples with and without
children from 22 countries using data from the 2007 and 2008 waves of the International Social
Survey Programme and the 2006 and 2008 European Social Surveys. They found that although
children lowered happiness in some countries, parents in other nations experienced a happiness
surplus. For example, compared with childless couples, parents with children in Norway and
Hungary tend to be happier. However, parents in Australia and Great Britain were less happy than
their childless counterparts. The country with the largest happiness deficit related to having
children was the United States. The authors argue that the parenthood gap is explained by
differences in State-provided family support, and hypothesize that the broader policy context helps
explain why adults living with children report lower happiness than those who do not live with
children. They estimate that the parental-status happiness gap will be smaller in countries with
more-generous family policies than in countries that provide minimal public assistance to parents.
Herbst and Ifcher (2016) examined the relationship between parental status and happiness using
data from the General Social Survey from 1972 through 2008 and the DDB Needham Lifestyle
Survey from 1985-2005. They found that parents’ relative happiness has been increasing over
time, a finding that is driven by the absolute decline in non-parents’ happiness. The authors also
find that the parental happiness gap depends on the time-period and age-group analyzed. There is
no evidence of a parental gap well-being for those aged 45 and under. In what follows we will
also find marked differences in well-being and children for those in their childbearing years under
the age of forty-five and those who are older.
One of the major findings of our work here is that family finances play a key role in our analysis
of Eurobarometer data: once we control for the difficulty in paying bills the negative impact of
children on life satisfaction disappears and becomes positive. We also find evidence that children
under the age of ten raise happiness but that this is less the case for children aged 10-14. There
are also differences by age of respondent.
We in addition underline that the correlation between parental well-being and the presence of
children at older ages depends critically on whether the children are your own or not. It is wellknown that separation and divorce are associated with lower well-being, although work does find
adaptation over time to these phenomena. Our findings here show, however, that separation and
divorce may continue to play a role in the longer run via the presence of step-children.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our data from the
Eurobarometer. Section 3 then presents our main regression results, estimating the relationship
between children and life satisfaction for 15 marital-status/children groups, and then
demonstrating the importance of family finances in explaining the patter of results. Last, Section
4 concludes.

2. Data
We will here analyse European data to set out the relationship between children and well-being.
But as background, and to illustrate the common finding that children lower well-being, we first
look at data from the US General Social Survey from 1972-2016, as used in Blanchflower and
Oswald (2004). The happiness question in the GSS is ‘taken all together, how would you say
things are these days—would you say that you are very happy (=3), pretty happy (=2), or not too
happy (=1)?’ (GSS question 157). The numbers in parentheses refer to how we coded the variable.
We regressed happiness on age and its square, gender, a Black ethnicity dummy, years of
education, seven labor-force status dummies, four marital-status dummies, a time trend and a
dummy variable for there being any children in the household. The coefficient on the children
present variable was negative and statistically significant: in a standard US happiness equation
children lower happiness.3
Our main contribution here is based on large-scale European cross-section data from multiple
repeated cross-section Eurobarometer surveys in the form of an unbalanced panel of countries.
The Standard Eurobarometer series has been running for 45 years now, having been established in
1974. There are several surveys a year, consisting of interviews with around 1000 respondents in
each participating country.4 Not all of the surveys include questions on life satisfaction but an
increasing proportion over time do. The Eurobarometer surveys information on respondent's life
satisfaction as reported in response to the question “On the whole, are you very satisfied, fairly
satisfied, not very satisfied or not at all satisfied with the life you lead?”. The possible responses
were Very satisfied (=4), Fairly satisfied (=3), Not very satisfied (=2) and Not at all satisfied (=1),
with the figure in parentheses showing how we code the variable in our empirical analysis.
We have merged together life satisfaction data from 35 Eurobarometer surveys over the ten-year
from 2009-2018.5 Prior to 2009 the Eurobarometer surveys only recorded marital status and did
not provide information on the presence of children. These surveys produce a total of over one
million observations across all twenty-eight EU countries plus Albania, Iceland, Macedonia,
Montenegro, Serbia, Turkish Cyprus and Turkey in the post-recession period. The data files
include, in addition to the above four-step life-satisfaction variable a number of standard variables

3

The estimated equation had 57,244 observations and, with all the above controls, the coefficient on the children
present variable was -.0410 with a t-statistic of 5.63 and an adjusted R2 of .0811.

This standard series is augmented by Special and Flash Eurobarometers on specific issues.

These are the Eurobarometer surveys we use - 2009=#71.1; #71.3; 2010=#73.4; #74.2; 2011=#75.3; #75.4; #76.3;

that appear in life-satisfaction equations, including age and its square, gender, marital status,
schooling and labor-force status (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004, 2008 and 2018).
There are 1,046,785 observations on life satisfaction in our pooled data file across the ten years
2009-2018. Over these years, on the one-to-four scale, mean life satisfaction is 2.93 with a
standard deviation of .80. Over time, mean life satisfaction rose from 2.86 in 2009 in the EU
countries to 3.01 in 2018. Table 1 reports the average life-satisfaction scores by country for 2009,
2015 and 2018, for the countries which appear in all three data waves.6 We can see that the 2018
values are higher than those in 2009 for every country except Belgium, Cyprus, Croatia,
Luxembourg and Sweden (where the drop is -0.07 of a point or less), showing the broad recovery
in well-being following the start of the financial crisis. In contrast to the 2018 World Happiness
Report, which used the Cantril ladder, we do not conclude that Finland has the highest well-being
level: it ranks seventh in terms of life satisfaction in our most recent data in 2018 after, in order,
Denmark,
the
Netherlands
Sweden,
Ireland,
the
UK
and
Luxembourg
(http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2018/). Greece has the lowest life-satisfaction score, having
dropped below Bulgaria in 2012. Italy ranks fifth from last.
Our key right-hand side variables refer to marital status and the presence and number of children
living in the household. The Eurobarometer tells us not only about the respondent’s current marital
situation, but also about the presence of children and, critically, whether these children are from
the current relationship. The data are reported separately depending on whether the respondent is
single, married, living with a partner, divorced or separated or widowed. We also know the number
of children in the household under the age of ten and between ten and fourteen who are living in
the household. We are able to analyze the relationship between children and parental well-being
separately for older and younger adults (we use age 45 as the split between the two).
The exact question used was as follows along with the numbers of observations for those with and
without children. We exclude the 13,166 cases where the respondent did not answer the question,
leaving a sample of 1,037,106.

Overall 38.9% of the sample were living with children in the household (403,450/1,037,196) and,
as might be expected, those aged under 45 are more likely to live with children than those aged 45
and over (48.7% versus 31.8%). We also know that 26.5% of the sample was living with one or
more children under the age of fifteen, with 46.9% of those under 45 in this category versus 11.4%
for those aged 45 and over, and only 5% for those aged 60 and over.
Table 2 shows the variety of different marital/children situations that we can identify, together
with average life satisfaction on the one-to-four scale. The numbered elements in the top panel of
Table 2 show our variety of marital/children statuses. We can then identify individuals who are
married or remarried (statuses 1-4), who account for 54.4% of the sample, those living together
(5-8; 11.1%), single and living alone (9 and 10; 17.6%), divorced or separated (11 and 12; 7.5%)
and widowed (13 and 14; 9.4%). It is in addition possible to identify individuals who have children
at home (2-4; 6-8; 10, 12 and 14), who represent 38.9% of the sample. The second panel of Table
2 shows differences in happiness by marital status, and that the divorced, separated and widowed
are less satisfied than singles, those living together or the married. Last, we not only know whether
these respondents have children, but also how many there are and how old they are. The bottom
panels of Table 2 refer to the number of children aged up to 10, and the number of young adolescent
children aged 10-14. Life satisfaction rises as the number of young children moves from zero to
three and then falls. There is a less marked rise as the number of teenagers rises. We report below
that younger children provide more happiness than teenagers.
Average life satisfaction differs by marital status and the presence of children. The happiest group
is singles living with a partner without children (with a life-satisfaction score of 3.02). The
divorced and widowed have lower life satisfaction than the single or married, and the least satisfied
are the widowed with children (2.60), followed by the divorced or separated with children (2.70).
The partnered are slightly more satisfied than the (re)married, who are themselves notably more
satisfied than singles. Within both marriage and single, those without children are a little more
satisfied with their lives than those with children. This is reflected in the difference in life
satisfaction in the middle of Table 2 between those with and without children. Last, with respect
to child age, it is clear that younger children are associated with higher levels of life satisfaction
than are adolescent children.
While these raw data differences are of interest, they do not necessarily reveal the relationship
between life satisfaction and children or marital status, as there are many other potential
confounders at work here, such as financial constraints and age. In order to hold these factors
constant, we turn to regression analysis to produce ceteris paribus estimates: this is the subject of
the next section.

3. Children and Unhappiness
We no turn to determining the impact of children on happiness. Table 3 shows the results of
estimating standard OLS life-satisfaction equations estimated first on the overall sample and then
separately by age and then by gender. We include a full set of country dummies. Our key control
variables here are a dummy for children being present in the household, derived from the marital
status variable in Table 2, and a simple set of marital-status dummies (living together, single,
divorced/separated, and widowed; the omitted category is married). We also include controls for
schooling and labor-force status and year. Life satisfaction rises with schooling and is higher for
workers and lowest for the unemployed. The estimated coefficients on the year dummies rise over
time.
The regression results show that the presence of children is associated with lower satisfaction,
overall, in both age of respondent categories and for men and women, which is the usual result
found in the literature, although the effect size is small here. The estimated children coefficient in
equation 1, at -.0276, is only around 3.5% of a standard deviation (=0.80). The estimated
coefficients on the other control variables are consistent with those in the existing literature, in
particular revealing a U-shape between life satisfaction and age (see Clark et al., 1996, and
Blanchflower and Oswald, 2008, 2018), which here is estimated in column 1 to minimize at age
fifty-one. We also find markedly lower levels life satisfaction for the divorced, separated and
widowed. The pattern of the estimated coefficients on the country variables (not shown here for
space reasons) is also consistent with that in earlier work, being higher in the Nordic countries and
lowest in Greece and low in a number of East-European countries.
Table 4 moves on from the simple children and marital-status variables above, replacing them by
the combined fifteen marital status and children variables that were presented in Table 2. The
happiest group in the first column are the married with no children (the excluded category). Every
other group has significantly lower life satisfaction, controlling for the variables listed above.
Singles living alone with children and the widowed and divorced/separated with or without
children are especially unhappy. Regarding the married, it is notable that children from previous
marriages seem to lower happiness more than those from the current relationship. That is true
even where children from the present marriage are mixed in with those from a previous
relationship. Those living together with or without children are equally happy.
In the case of the younger age group, the happiest are now those who are married with children,
who have significantly higher levels of satisfaction than the married without children. Once again
singles living with children, and those who are divorced, separated or widowed, with or without
children, have significantly lower happiness levels. The older cohort is broadly the same as the
overall equation with the married without children having significantly higher satisfaction as
compared to any other group.
We now move on to try to understand why the existing literature, as well as our initial analysis
reported above, has largely concluded that children do not raise happiness. It turns out that any
negative effect of children is frequently reversed once we control for the financial difficulties that
the household may have in paying their bills. Children are expensive. Difficulties in paying one’s
bills is likely highly stressful.
6

Difficulties paying the bills and happiness
Why do children have such different effects according to their parents’ marital status? One
possibility is that many parents with children struggle to pay their bills for food, accommodation
and clothing, toys etc. In this respect, Eurobarometer respondents were asked “During the last
twelve months, would you say you had difficulties to pay your bills at the end of the month?”, with
the response categories almost never/never (=1), occasionally (=2) and most of the time (=3).
Table 5 reports the distribution of financial difficulties by the values of our combined marital status
and children variable. The single and the married without children have the least difficulty paying
bills. The highest percentage figures for having difficulty paying bills most of the time is found
for the single and divorced/separated living with children. In addition, this difficulty broadly rises
with the number of children. As such, part of the subjective well-being impact of children might
be mediated by financial difficulties. Financial difficulties reduce happiness, as expected, just as
income raises happiness (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004).
The fact that children increase subjective well-being more for parents with higher education could
then show that children are associated with a smaller increase in financial distress for the bettereducated. This is indeed what our data show. Below we report the proportion of individuals who
say they “never or almost never” have difficulty paying their bills by schooling level and age
across all the years (N=1,021,138). The overall total also includes individuals who didn't answer
the question or refused.

For those under the age of 45, the percentage who never have difficulty in paying bills is twelve
percentage points lower with children present for those with the lowest level of education of no
full-time education, but the analogous gap is only a third of this figure (at four percentage points)
for those with higher levels of education. The differences for those aged 45 or more are even more
striking: the percentage who never have difficulty in paying bills is nearly twenty percentage points
lower with children present for those with the two lowest levels of education, with analogous
figures for medium (ALS 16-19) and higher education (ALS 20+) of 14 and 12 percentage points
respectively.
To see whether financial difficulties attenuate the effect of children on life satisfaction, we
explicitly introduce them into the life-satisfaction equation in Table 6. The estimated coefficients
on the difficulty paying bills dummies are extremely significant and negative with t-values of over
100 and are correlated with life satisfaction in the way that we would expect. They are larger in
size for the older age group.

7

The most interesting aspect of Table 6 is that, overall, for both men and women and for both age
groups, and then separately for men and women under the age of forty-five, the coefficient on the
children present variable now becomes significantly positive in all five cases. When we ran the
equation for men only the child variable was insignificant whereas for women it was significant
and positive. If we restrict the sample by age and then re-estimated it separately by gender, in both
cases the children coefficient is insignificantly different from zero (results not reported).
Controlling for financial difficulties we then find that children now increase happiness. Why else
would you have them? This appears to solve the puzzle in the literature. It seems crucial to control
for the household’s financial circumstances, and once we do so the sign on the child-present
variable switches sign. We now carry out a number of further tests to show that result is very
stable to changes in specification.
Table 7 splits the sample into sixteen richer and nineteen poorer countries, as defined by GDP per
capita. The poor grouping consists of fifteen former Communist countries in Eastern Europe
(Albania; Bulgaria; Croatia; Czech Republic; Estonia; Hungary; Latvia; Lithuania; Makedonia;
Montenegro; Poland; Romania; Serbia; Slovakia and Slovenia) plus four poorer Western countries
(Cyprus, Greece, Turkey and Turkish Cyprus). The richer countries are Austria; Belgium;
Denmark; Finland; France; Germany; Iceland; Ireland; Italy; Luxembourg; Malta; Netherlands;
Portugal; Spain; Sweden and the UK. We find that in both richer and poorer countries, without
controlling for the difficulty in paying bills, children reduce happiness, with the coefficient on the
child variable being significant and negative. In both groups of countries, once the financial
difficulties that children presumably help bring are controlled for in columns 2 and 4 the sign
switches to being significantly positive. Hence children bring happiness in both rich and poor
countries once the financial difficulties they likely induce are controlled for. Children are
expensive. One of our daughters, who has three kids under three, goes through eight gallons of
milk a week.
In Table 8 we replace the children-present (1,0) dummy with two variables for the number of
children in the household under the age of ten and the number aged 10-14. The results are reported
separately by age group, with the same controls as in the previous tables. The number of young
children always enters significantly positively in both specifications for the younger age group,
independently of controlling for difficulty in paying bills. Teenagers are associated with happiness
in the younger sample only when financial difficulties are controlled for in the second column.
Children of all ages attract negative significant estimated coefficients for the older age group in
column 3 without financial controls. When these are introduced in column 4, both children
variables attract positive coefficients, although that for teenagers is only weakly significant
(t=1.79).
Table 9 reports three sets of results derived from three separate equations for each of our thirtyfive European countries, and overall. The sample size refers to the estimates from columns 1 and
2. The first column reports the sign on the children variable using the same specification as in
column 1 of Table 3. The second column adds the two difficulty of paying bills variables. The
final two columns are obtained from the same equation, which includes the difficulty of paying
bills variables but replaces the child present variable with the numbers of children under 10 and

8

10-14. The symbols are as follows: + if the coefficient is positive and significant (t³1.96), - if it
is negative and significant (t³1.96) and * if it is statistically insignificantly different from zero
(t<1.96).
In column 1, out of the thirty-six lines there are sixteen significant negatives and six significant
positives and fourteen that are insignificant. Column 2 then reports the same coefficient when the
two financial variables are added. There are now only three significant negative children
coefficients for Malta, Holland and Spain, but thirteen significant positives. In column 3 there are
twenty-seven positives and only one significant negative, for Malta. In column 4 there are six
positives and only one negative for Hungary. It does then seem that younger children make their
parents happy, but teenagers rather less so.
Last, Table 10 reverts to the broader marital-status and children classifications of Table 4, but now
including the two paying-bills variables. These two latter are again very significantly negative;
financial burdens lower well-being. In column 1 the married with children from the present
relationship are the happiest, while the married with children from a previous marriage are less
happy than married people with no kids. Singles, divorced, separated and widowed with or without
children are all unhappy.
For the younger age group in column two the married with children from that marriage are the
happiest; whether there are kids as well from a previous marriage makes no significant difference.
For the older age group there is no significant difference between those married without kids and
those with children from that marriage. However, if they only have kids from a previous marriage,
they are less happy than any other married group.
Controlling for financial variables matters. Comparing the results in Table 10 to those (without
financial difficulties) in Table 4, we can see that the financial implications of children explain the
lion’s share of the negative children coefficient for those who are married or cohabiting. For the
single, divorced/separated and widowed, the children coefficient is also smaller when controlling
for financial difficulties, but only of the order of one quarter to one half.
Even controlling for financial difficulties, marital status continues to matter. The married and
those cohabiting are happier with children (from this marriage/partnership) than without children.
The presence of children for the divorced, separated or widowed does not convey additional
happiness compared to others with the same marital status who have no kids. The single, divorced,
separated or widowed, whether they have children or not, continue to be less happy than the
married or cohabiting, whether or not the latter have children from this or a previous relationship.
Married people with kids from that relationship are happiest when under 45; for those over 45 the
married people are also the happiest but here the presence of children the current marriage does
not add to happiness.

4. Conclusion
We have here investigated the relationship between children and parental subjective well-being.
In our baseline specifications using information on over one million Europeans we find the same
result as in the existing literature: children do not raise life satisfaction. Our contribution here is

9

to explain this perhaps counter-intuitive result by the correlation between children and financial
hardship.
We have information on the difficulty individuals have in paying their bills. When we control for
this variable in life-satisfaction regressions, the negative as well as the insignificant estimated
coefficients on children disappear in the vast majority of cases. Children then raise happiness as
long as they do not lead to difficulties in paying the bills. According to our estimation results, a
couple that has children and continues to have no problems in paying the bills will become happier
by doing so: equally, a couple that sometimes had difficulty paying bills before children and
continues to sometimes have difficulty after children will also be happier from having children.
The negative effect of children the comes from their effect on financial difficulties. We argue that
the existing results in the literature on the groups whose well-being is more likely to be positively
correlated with children (those in richer countries, those with higher income, older parents) can all
be read in this light.
Even so, not all children are equally correlated with parental life satisfaction. We first find that
child age matters. In particular, younger children (those aged up to ten) appear to make parents
happier, but the presence of young teenagers less so. Second, the correlation between children and
life satisfaction depends on whose children they are. In our baseline results, parents with children
from a previous relationship systematically report lower life satisfaction than those with children
from the current relationship, with a life satisfaction gap of around 0.1 of a point. It is notable that
the largest part of this gap reflects again the correlations of (step-)children with family finances:
once we control for difficulties in paying bills, the gap between own and others’ children is sharply
reduced in size, although it remains significant.
Marital status matters when determining whether children bring happiness. We could find little or
no significant difference for either age group, for example, between those with or without children
who are separated or divorced. the same applied to the single and to the widowed. Having children
raises the happiness of married people compared to those who have no kids. The married and
those who live together, whether or not they had children, are everywhere significantly happier
than those in the other categories with or without children.
Our broad conclusions are then two-fold. First, that children are associated with greater parental
satisfaction in favourable financial circumstances. Second, that not all children are the same. In
particular, economic downturns, by increasing financial distress, will diminish the satisfaction
return from children. In addition, the answer to the question “Yours or Mine?” is important, with
step-children being systematically associated with lower life satisfaction than own children, a
relationship that is also partly mediated by financial distress. This distinction will arguably become
increasingly important in European countries with the shorter duration of relationships and the rise
in second marriages.
