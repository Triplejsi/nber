Labor Market Institutions, Constraints,

arid

Performance

ABSTRACT
This study examines the changes in labor market institutions and outcomes
across (ECD countries in the past two decades and relates indicators of the
institutions to outcomes.

It has four findings.

First, there has been an

increased divergence in labor market institutions, with unionisation growing or
remaining at high levels of density in some countries while declining in
others.

Second, changes in the two major outcomes on which analysts and policy-

makers focus -- employment and real wages -- are substantially negatively
correlated across countries, conditional on growth of GDP.

Countries that had

rapid growth of employment in the l9]Os or 1980s, and high employment to
had relatively slow
working age population rates, such as the U.S. or Sweden,
with relatively slow growth
Crowth of real wages; while by contrast countries
of employment, such as Spain, had rapid growth of real wages, indicative of a
labor demand type constraint on outcomes,

Third, there is a moderate nonlinear

relation between labor market outcomes and institutions: countries with either
relatively centralized wage-setting (as evidenced by little inter-industry

with
dispersion of wages) such as the Scandinavian countries and countries
decentralized wage-setting (as indicated by high inter-industry dispersion of
countries with intermediate
wages) had better performances in employment than

even among countries
types of labor market structures and institutions. Fourth,
with comparable institutions, there is a considerable diversity of performance.

Labor Market Institutions, Constraints, and Economic Performance

The labor market experiences of advanced economies diverged sharply in the
1970s and l980s: employment increased in North America, Australia, and Japan
while stagnating in many western European countries; real wages grew rapidly in

most OECD countries but not in the United States, then generally stabilized or

Europe's stagnant employment on union policies
that reduce wage and employment flexibility and extol the US as the paragon of

a flexible efficient market.

Other observers (largely American) bemoan the

slow growth of productivity and shift of jobs to low wage industries in the US

unemployment on decentralized wage-setting that permits real wage growth
despite joblessness and see a solution in Swedish-style

'corporatism'

Do labor market institutions in OECD countries differ sufficiently to have
caused the observed differences in economic performances of the 1970s-l980s?

Do claims that labor market flexibility, unionism, centralised or decentralized
wage-setting

affect outcomes stand up to critical investigation?

To answer these questions

in Labor Markets: Union Density and Wage Structures

Labor market institutions, wage-setting systems, and the wage structures
that reflect those systems changed in different wsys in developed countries in
the lPiOs and lPSOs.

The proportion of workers represented by unions fell in

the US, Japan, and, after a period of growth, in the UK and Netherlands while
increasing or stabilizing in most OECD countries.

Wage differentials by

industry and skill, which historically narrow with develop-ment, rose in some
countries but not in those with centralized wage setting.

Union density/collective bargaining representation
Table 1 records figures on the proportion of nonagricultural wage and

salary workers in the traditionally most important labor market institution in
capitalism -- trade unions.
(it reflects representation

As unionism has different meanings across settings
at the company level and the Shunto offensive in

Japan; collective bargaining to a written agreement in the US; national wagethe figures

Statistic's International Comparisons of Hourly Compensation Costs for
Production Workers in Manufacturing.

The data differs in several ways: UN and

EEC figures are wage and salary bills divided by total employment; the ILO and

Eurostat data are hourly earnings; while the BLS measures hourly compensation.
The number of industries varies by data set and in some instances by country

within a data Set (5). Service industries are under-represented.

As usual with

international comparative data, moreover, the data trade-off comparability
among countries for accuracy about any particular country.

The purpose of

several data sets is to enable me to differentiate patterns that are

robust across sources and thus more likely to be valid from patterns that
result from peculiarities in a particular data set.
Table 2 summarizes the results of my calculations, with countries grouped

by the level and change in dispersion in the l97Os-early l9BOs and with the
variances multiplied by 100 for ease of presentation.

Despite differences

among data, the table reveals abroad similarity in dispersion that
differentiates

between countries where pay is centrally determined

(i.e.

Scandinavian countries) and countries with decentralized wage-setting
Japan, etc.).

The table also shows that dispersion increased in the US, Japan,

Canada, New Zealand, Australia,

and possibly Norway; decreased markedly in

Italy; but did not change in most other countries.

As the historic pattern is

for wage differentials to narrow or at least not increase, the rise has
attracted

attention (see Bell and Freeman,l985; Lawrence and Lawrence,1986).

The most aberrant figures are from the EEC file, whose calculated dispersions
for Italy and France are out of line with those from other sources, though
showing similar changes over time, and those for Norway, which is rated high in

dispersion in the UN data but low in ILO data.

Consider, for example, the patterns of change in skill premia.

During the 1970s premia by years of schooling or occupation narrowed in moat
developed countries, often substantially, as the influx of young educated
workers created by the baby boom and post-world war II expansion of higher
education reduced the pay of the more educated (Freeman,198l).

The 1980s

experience has been more varied: education and white collar/manual pay ratios
widened sharply in the U.S. and U.K. to

pre-l970s levels

while maintaining

levels much narrower than in the early l970s in many other OECD countries
(Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Norway, Australia, Finland, and Japan, according to
OECD, 1987b).

As for differentials by sex, the ratio of female to male pay is

higher and increased more in economies with centralized wage-setting such as
Sweden or with special centralized features such as Australia than in
decentralized economies such as the U.S. (Gregory and Ho,l985; OECD,1985).
Finally, differentials by age also changed across countries, steepening in the
U.S. and some other countries with baby-boom induced increases in the supply of

remaining stable in countries with centralized wage-setting (Bloom
1986; OECD,l984; Leroy,1987).

In short, the pattern of wage differentials

is sufficiently similar
along dimensions other than industry across countries

to that in industry differentials to make industry dispersion a reasonable
indicator of differences in overall wage-setting systems.

When one contrasts specific countries with less pronounced- institutional
differences, however, these broad-based measures can be misleading.

Consider,

for instance,-relative wage flexibility by geographic area in the US, which

and

is generally

viewed as the archetypal flexible labor market and in the UK, which ranks in
the middle of the unionism category and has a modestly narrower industry wage
structure,

As can be seen in Table 3, in the US wages are high in areas of

high unemployment and show little response to increases in unemployment whereas
in the UK wages declined in the 1980s in high unemployment areas,

These

patterns imply greater rather than smaller responsiveness of pay to area
unemployment in the UK.

Relative pay by skill and age also appear to have been

no less flexible in the UK than in the US in the
both countries, as noted earlier.

The implication is that while dispersion,

union density, and other broad indicators of labor market institutions may
accurately reflect gross differences between centralized and decentralized
labor markets, they may not depict accurately differences in the operation of
markets between specific countries,

comparing measures of labor market_structure
This said, how closely linked are union density and industry dispersion to
one another and to widely used indices of corporatism or other categorizations

of labor market institutions?
As a first step

to answering these questions I calculated correlation

coefficients between the union densities in table 1 and industry wage
dispersions in Table 2, obtaining values ranging from

-030

to -056, and

calculated correlations between 1970-1980 changes in density and in 1973-84
changes in dispersion, obtaining a coefficient of 0.36.

The correlations show

that wage dispersion contains information beyond that captured by union
density

and conversely.

Third, I correlated union density in 1980

and had lower

The relatively small correlation between wage

dispersion and centralization is due to Austria, which they rank as number one
in centralization while it has, as noted, high wage dispersion. (6)

The union density and dispersion of industry wage indicators of labor
market structures have three advantages over judgmental categorisations: they
are based on

hard' statistics; they vary over time in a natural way: and they

lead one to look in close at actual wage outcomes and union representation.
The disadvantage is that they are a step removed from the corporatist/centralized wage setting and flexible market concepts that underlie the debate over
alternative labor market arrangements.

As they have both advantages and

disadvantages, in ensuing analyses I use them and judgmental categorisations of
institutions to indicate the nature of the labor market structures that may
affect outcomes,

First, however, it is necessary to delineate country

differences in outcomes and examine the labor demand relation that constrains
employment and wage outcomes,

comparing changes over one period rather than another, and so on (e.g. "manufacturing productivity is rising rapidly in the U.K." versus "employment is
below 1979 levels").

To deal with this problem I present in Table 4 data on

levels and changes in several outcomes,

Columns 1-4 show the divergence in

employment/working age population and unemployment rates among OECD countries
that has attracted most attention.

The unemployment figures document the shift

of the U.S. from relatively high to relatively low unemployment while the

The

'reason' is indicated in column 6's change in labor productivity (GDP per
employee) and column 7's change in real wages, which are inversely related
across countries to growth of employment (compare US and Sweden with Belgium
and UK).

If one adjusts the productivity growth figures for the 1975-1986 4-9%

decline in annual hours worked in Europe compared to the US (OECD 1987),
moreover, the difference in productivity growth between the US and OECD Europe
becomes even more pronounced,

One uncommon interpretation of the US-Europe
is that Americans

had to work more to obtain

similar increases in living standard, and thus that high employment America did
not perform as well as low employment Europe, save for workaholics.
Columns 8 and 9 turn to levels of performance.

They contrast GD? per

capita and GD? per worker across countries in OECD purchasing power parity
units.

These figures show greater similarity in GD? per worker than in GD? per

capita, due to the fact that countries with low employment/population rates
have correspondingly higher productivity.

This presumably reflects increases

in measured productivity as employment falls along production functions.

also that, concern about Japanese productivity notwithstanding, GDP per worker

From the perspective of labor market analysis it is the relations between
employment/unemployment performance and productivity/real wages in Table 4 that
are most intriguing.

In a period in which GDP growth did not differ greatly

among countries (could not differ much because of economic and technological
interdependence?) the differing performance of countries along these two
dimensions raises the possibility that their economies faced similar wage/
employment trade-off schedules, of the sort often modelled by labor demand,
though also explicable in other ways (Solow 1986)

and thus that thfferences in

employment reflect in part the position of countries along that schedule.

wage employment trade-off: aggregate evidence
The standard method for analysing the impact of wages on employment across
countries is to estimate

time

series demand relations for individual countries,

and to use differences in estimated response parameters to account for
differences in performances (e.g. the 1986 Unemployment Economica Supplement).

My approach in this section is different.

I

take changes in wages and

employment across countries (industries) over the same period rather than time
series changes within a country as units of observation.

I use the same

equation for all countries, and thus attribute differing Outcomes among
countries to different changes in explanatory variables rather than to
differing response parameters.

To finesse issues of dynamic adjustments,

moreover, I take changes over long periods.
Formally, my analysis can be represented by the following employment
(demand) equation:
dlnEc —

a

dln%Jc +

b

dlnXc + uc,

(1)

10

where din is the log change operator; E is employment; Wc are wages; X is a
demand-shift variable; u is a residual; the subscript c indexes country.

If one assumes that each country has its own

response

parameters, a + ac

and b + bc, where a and b are the mean responses and ac and bc are the countryspecific components, then the latter are subsumed into the residual:

similar across countries are subsumed in the constant term.
results
Table 5 presents the results of estimating relations between changes in
employment, real wages, and output for the entire economy in 19 OECD countries
and for manufacturing in 12 countries over different time periods.

In panels A

and & the dependent variable is total employment, output is real GD?, and wages
are manufacturing earnings (A) or compensation of employees from national
product accounts per employee deflated by the GDP deflator (E); and changes are
measured as in changes over the entire period.

In Panel C the dependent

variable is total hours worked in manufacturing, output is value added in
manufacturing, and wages are total compensation for manufacturing production
workers deflated by GDP deflator; because the BLS publishes the data as
compound annual changes, changes are measured in those units.
All three Sets of calculations show that, conditional on the growth of
output, changes in wages and employment were significantly inversely related,

by contrast, the price in an Industry responds to wages according

Which assumption Is more plausible?

For some industries and countries,

In the absence of a detailed pricing model, prudence dictates analysis of both.

where the elasticity h embodies substitution and scale effects; X is an

The major problem with models of this type is the absence of measures of
shifts in demand, which forces researchers to use actual output or instruments
to proxy shifts.

This creates problems due

to the endogeneity

of output

through the production function and the uncertain quality of instruments,
Cross-country data on the same industries allows us to treat the problem by
decomposing the shift component into country-specific, industry-specific, and
residual interaction effects:

Then, pooling industry snd country data, one can use industry dummy

to identify industry shifts (dlnTi and dlnxi) and country dummies to

identify country shifts (dlnTc and dlnXc), eliminating endogenous output:
dlnEic

-hdlnWic + D' +

C'+

(7)

where D' is a vector of industry dummies, C' is a vector of country dummies and
the ic subscripts relate to industry and country respectively.

With two countries this is equivalent to comparing differences in changes
in employment and differences in changes in wages.

If labor demand behavior

dominates the data, the country whose industry has a greater increase in wsges
will have a smaller increase in employment.
Alternatively, the change in industry production in all countries can be

used to proxy shifts in demand in an industry, yielding:
dlnEic —

-hdlnWic + edlnQi'+

(8)

C',

where Qi' is the sum of production in industry i in the countries under study.
This equation asks "what is the impact of changes in wages on employment given
world expansion of the industry, and employment trends in the country?"
results

Analysis of thE relation between chsnges in employment and wages by
industry in the EEC and UN data sets confirms the existence of a significant
wage-employment

tradeoff across and within countries.

Specifically:

(1) Regressions of changes in employment on changes in wages and output by
industry within countries, auzsissrized in appendix tables Al and A2, yield

negative coefficients on wages of similar magnitudes among countries in both
the EEC and UN data sets.

The similarity justifies pooling the dats into s

(2) Whether one assumes that industry prices are exogeneously set

on world

markets or depend on industry wages in a country does not affect the inverse
employment/wage relation.

This is shown in the EEC regressions in table Al,

where the regressions on the left hand side use wages and value added deflated

by sector prices as explanatory variables (on the assumption that prices are
determined on world markets> while the regressions on the right hand side use
wages and value added in current values as explanatory variables (on the
assumption that prices depend on wages).

Both regressions yield compatable

negative coefficients on wages.

of the impact of relative wages on

interpret this finding in ways other than that suggested here, the trade-off
represents the basic fact that any explanation of the divergence in outcomes

must address.
III.

Institutional Differences and Outcomes
The question that arises next is whether the differences in outcomes

across countries examined in section II are related to the labor market
institutions examined in section I?

Do countries with one set of institutions

perform differently than countries with other institutions?
Extant empirical analyses offer, as noted, conflicting answers.

Some

studies interpret the post oil-shock economic record as showing the success of
'corporatist' economies

(Crouch,1985; Bruno and Sachs 1986; Tarantelli 1986;

Bean, Layard, and Nickell,1986; Newell and Symons 1986).

Others see better

economic performances among countries with decentralized flexibility or with
particular kinds of flexible labor market arrangements (Klau and Mittelstadt
1986; Freeman and Weitzman,l986; Bruno and Sachs,1986 with respect to nominal
wage responsiveness).

The failure of several follow-up analyses to confirm

initial claims about the effect of institutions, seemingly because of modest
differences in performance measures and periods covered (Van Poeck,l987;
Summers and Wadwhani,1987;

my calculations (11)), suggest the danger of

generalizing from results based on a particular model and data set,

and the aquare of

those figures, the 1979 percentage unioniaed from Table 1, a 0-I corporatist
dummy variable and the In change in output in the country.

The key

coefficients are those on dispersion, as they are designed to reflect the
impact of both highly centralized (low dispersion) and decentralized (high
dispersion) labor market arrangements on outcomes.

If the two labor market

structures produce similar outcomes, the equation will have a parabolic form,

with linear and squared terms obtaining opposite signs in the regressions.
The regressions for employment/population in line 1 show that in fact this
is the case for overall labor utilisation: the level of dispersion has a
negative impact on employment while its square has a positive impact,
indicating that increases in dispersion are first associated with falling then

with rising employment/population rates, and thus that both countries with
centralized and those with decentralized labor markets generated more
employment

than others.

The unemployment regression in line

pattern with oppositely signed coefficients, as one would expect, though the
parabolic form has less statistical significance.

with falling real wage, as one would expect if the lahoc market institutions
affect employment along the employment-real wage trade-off schedule.

As

I

could find no such pattern in the hourly pay figures in the OECD data, I am
unwilling to make much of this result.

Even the ELS data show, moreover,

greater divergence in changes in real wages than in employment across countries

with 'similar' labor market inatitutions, suggesting that the existence of
country differences in the teal wage-employment trade-off that are subsumed in
error terms in our regreasions.

IV Summary
This paper has four messages regarding labor market institutions,
constraints, and outcomes in DECO countries in the l970s and lYEOs:
1) Labor

market institutions diverged markedly in the period under study:

union density increased in many countries but declined sharply in the US and
moderately

in some others; industrial wage dispersion rose in several less

unionised countries, including the US, fell in Italy, while holding steady in
several highly unionised countries.
2) The level and change in employment-to-population

rates and change in

real wages differed among countries and among industries within countries along
a trade-off schedule that suggests that movements along demand curves were an
important factor in the divergence in outcomes in the period.
3) Labor market institutions were related to outcomes in a nonlinear way,

with countries having centralized institutions/low wage dispersion and
countries having decentralized institutions/high wage dispersion doing better
in limiting unemployment and maintaining employment than countries with
intermediate labor market institutions.
4) There is sufficient diversity among countries with 'comparable'
inatitutiona to indicate that desireable, or undesireable, outcomes are not the
exclusive property of any single labor market arrangement, possibly because all

21

have the potential for adopting the 'right' or 'wrong' policies to attain
feasible outcomes.
Finally, it

is

important to recognize that the cross-country analysis in

this and other studies leaves open the issue of
-

- the

exportability' of institutions

extent to which labor market arrangments developed in one country can be

transferred to others.
primarily
economies,

Centralized corporatist labor markets are found

in small countries.
Perhaps

Decentralized markets characterize larger

whatever its virtue,

'corporatist' wage-setting could not

flourish in economies like the US or the UK as it does in Sweden and Denmark;

and conversely for ducentralized systems in smaller economic settings. If this
is the case, the issue to be addressed in the future ought not to be which

broad set of labor market arrangements 'work better' but rather which specific
policies and programs work and can be transfered to other countries.

22

Endnotes
I) There

are several sources of data on unionisation: union reports of

membership, enterpise reports on collective bargaining; household surveys; and
union financial records.

Among the problems with these different data are: the

tendency for unions to exaggerate membership in some periods (recognized as a
problem with U.K. statistics in the 1980s); lack of knowledge of collective
bargaining

status (by household recipients reporting on other recipients);

unwillingness

to make data public (in countries where dual unions compete)

.

In

the U.S. the Department of Labor terminated its survey of unions and now
reports figures from household data.
2) Tn the caee of France, figures on the proportion of workers covered by
industry-level

agreements suggest much higher union influence, while those on

the proportion covered by plant-level agreements are consistent with the low
density shown in the table. aee Ministere du Travail 1986.
3) For example,

the Workplace Industrial Relations Survey reports that the

proportion of private manufacturing establishments with no recognized union
rose from 35% to 44% between 1980 and 1984 (Millward and Stevens, 1986 p. 62)
while the New Earnings Survey shows a fall in the percentage of male workers
covered by collective bargaining from 74% in 1973 to 64% in 1984.

4) Several points of caution here.

First, it is possible for wage structures

to change while wage dispersion remains fixed-- if for instance, high and low

wage industries simply change position.

As wage structures show persistence of

rank order, however, this is not a serious problem.
could be high but all wages change in concert.

Second, wage dispersion

This would show up in different

orderings of countries by dispersion and dispersion of changes.
5) Calculations

in which I sued the same number of industries for all countries

did not alter any of the findings in the table.

23

6) The calculations are based on relating the dispersion figures from the UN

data to the union densities from table

1.

I

made one slight modification

in

the Chalafors and Driffill's ranking, giving Ireland the same ranking as the
UK, while they left out Ireland.
7) Annual hours worked: 2043 in Japan; 1888 in

US.;

1723 in the U.K.; 1678 in

Germany and 1630 in France, according to the OEGD, 1986
8) If labor costs were all of value added, then ln employment would be

perfectly negatively related to in wages, holding ln value added fixed, with a
coefficient

of one.

9) This data set was provided to me by Ms. Dewatripont of the University of
Bruxelles, whose work with V. Ginsberg and Dewatripont reveals a significant
wage-employment

tradeoff in time series analyses of these data for several

European countries, (Ginsberg and Dewatripont, 1987)
10) It is appropriate in cross-country analysis to measure exchange rates and

wages in nominal units as we are comparing changes in rates in one country
relative to those in other countries.
11) 1 find no relation between indices of corporatism or nominal wage
responsiveness

and the outcome measures Crouch and Bruno and Sachs use in their

analyses in the 1979-84 period.
