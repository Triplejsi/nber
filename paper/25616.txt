ABSTRACT
When markets fail to provide socially optimal outcomes, governments often intervene through
‘managed competition’ where firms compete for per-consumer subsidies. Subsidies are generally
set across geographies according to estimates of the cost of government provision, a method
which may not be welfare-maximizing. We introduce a framework for determining the optimal
subsidy schedule that features heterogeneity in consumer preferences and inertia, and firms with
heterogeneous costs that can set prices and product characteristics in response to changes in the
subsidy. We apply it to the Medicare Advantage program, which offers Medicare recipients
private insurance that replaces Traditional Medicare. We calculate counterfactual equilibria as a
function of the subsidies by estimating policy functions for product characteristics from the data
and solving for Nash equilibria in prices. The optimal schedule increases consumer surplus by
30% over the current policy and is well-approximated with a linear rule using market-level
observables.

Introduction

When the private market’s provision of a good or service deviates from the socially optimal outcome,
welfare may be improved through government intervention. Often times the obvious intervention
is direct government provision of the good or service. However, there is a long-standing concern
that government production programs can be inefficient, as government bureaucracies may lack
sufficient incentives to efficiently design and deliver goods. This concern has led to the idea that
governments can either regulate private firms or procure goods directly from those firms. These
approaches also raise a host of strategic and informational issues that make efficient implementation
challenging (Laffont and Tirole, 1993).
An alternative approach is for a government to provide subsidies to consumers who purchase
the good from competing firms under the rationale that profit maximization motives and competitive market pressures will push firms to provide the optimal quantity, variety, and quality at
a price nearing marginal cost. This “managed competition” approach is widely employed by the
US government to provide health insurance (Gruber, 2017). For example, under the “Medicare
Advantage” program (MA), Medicare beneficiaries can forgo the government-operated traditional
Medicare (TM) benefit structure and enroll in one of many differentiated health plans offered by
private firms. The firm assumes the financial and logistic responsibilities of the enrollee’s care and,
in return, receives a risk-adjusted per-capita payment from the government, based on a countyspecific “benchmark rate,” and premium payments from the enrollee. A similar system is used by
Medicare Part D and the individual insurance marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act.
Elements of the managed competition approach also appear in education, where public, charter,
and private primary and secondary schools compete on program offerings, education quality, and
productive efficiency (Hoxby, 2000, Levin, 2002), as well as housing policy, where new construction
is influenced by differences in tax credits across geographies (Baum-Snow and Marion, 2009).
Consider a government which seeks to maximize consumer surplus by allocating a fixed subsidy
budget B̄ across M markets denoted by m. Under a managed competition framework, the government chooses a schedule of market-level purchase subsidies {Bm } (i.e. the benchmark rates). Let
CSm (Bm ) be the consumer surplus and GovExpm (Bm ) be the government spending in market m
as a function of the benchmark rate. The generic optimal subsidy problem is given by

The solution to this problem depends on the derivatives of the CS and GovExp functions,
which in turn depend on the equilibrium interactions between firm and consumer behavior from
which the CS and GovExp functions are derived. In particular, this behavior often varies across
markets, and simple examples show that the optimal subsidy should also vary across markets as
a function of the costs of the private firms, the willingness-to-pay of consumers, and the way in
which competition leads firms to transform additional subsidy dollars into consumer surplus. In
practice, however, the subsidy schedule is typically determined by measures of the government’s
cost of providing the service in different markets, which may vary substantially from private firms’
costs and may be unrelated to demand conditions. For example, MA benchmark rates are set solely
as a function of average risk-adjusted county-level TM costs.
In this paper, we develop an approach for determining the optimal subsidy level across many
markets in managed competition settings conditional on a fixed government budget. In our setup,
multiproduct firms choose equilibrium prices and product characteristics in response to the subsidy
level set by the government and other competitive conditions.1 Consumers have heterogeneous
demographic characteristics and choose plans based on observable plan characteristics and unobservable plan-specific ‘quality.’ We take the mechanism that links a county-level subsidy to
payments to firms as fixed and focus on differences across markets. To our knowledge, we are the
first to study the optimal subsidy level in differentiated products environments in which firms can
adjust both price and non-price characteristics in response to changes in the subsidy.
We apply our approach to the MA program. Using individual-level panel data on consumer
demographics, option sets, and choices for the years 2008-2015, we provide descriptive evidence
that that the current policy is suboptimal and that firms respond to different benchmark rates
through changes in both prices and plan designs. The panel nature of our data allows us to
estimate switching costs, which are relevant due to the prevalence of narrow provider networks.
Our demographic variables include a self-reported health status which allows us to flexibly capture
demand behaviors which vary with health. We estimate the parameters of our model and find that
MA plans are more valuable to those who have lower income, lower educational attainment, are
younger, and are in better health. The average cost to switch between MA insurers is $523, which is
comparable to the average annual plan premium of $509. Firm costs differ both within and across
markets. Our estimates imply that in 2015, the MA program generated a total of $5.94 billion in

exit, the median share captured by new entrants is 0.18%. Decarolis et al. (2015) make a similar argument.

consumer surplus and $4.75 billion in variable profit with $98 billion in payments to MA plans.
To find the optimal subsidy schedule, we must calculate outcomes under counterfactual subsidies for each market. The traditional approach to computing counterfactual equilibria, searching
for a fixed-point in firms’ best-response functions, is impractical due to the complexity of MA
products – we capture nearly 50 product characteristics. Instead, we estimate policy functions for
product characteristics from the data, use those estimated functions to predict characteristics under
counterfactual benchmarks and then solve the firms’ first-order conditions for prices taking those
characteristics as given. We find that an across-the-board increase in benchmarks by $1 increases
government expenditures by $16.2 million and increases consumer surplus by $5.19 million – in
other words, the average marginal pass-through rate is 32%, though this rate varies across markets.
We find the optimal policy is meaningfully different from the current policy – the average
difference between the optimal benchmark and the 2015 benchmark is 3.6% or $330. Our estimates
imply that the optimal benchmarks increase average consumer surplus 30% from $149 to $193 per
Medicare-beneficiary-year. Relative to the 2015 policy, the optimal policy creates winners and losers
– consumer surplus in markets with larger benchmarks increases 62%, while the surplus in markets
with smaller benchmarks decreases 25%. We show that the derivatives of the consumer surplus and
government expenditure functions which drive the results are related to market-level observables,
and that a linear rule based on these observables results in a 4.4% reduction in consumer surplus
and a 0.5% increase in government expenditures relative to the optimal policy. We explore other
social welfare functions and find benchmark schedules that increase the average consumer surplus
and reduce the variance relative to the 2015 policy.
We build upon an extensive MA literature; see McGuire et al. (2011) for a review. Our work
is most related to Town and Liu (2003), Lustig (2010), Aizawa and Kim (2018) and Curto et al.
(2018). Town and Liu (2003) estimate a nested logit demand system for MA plans and calculate
that the program generated $113 in consumer surplus and $244 in profits per Medicare beneficiary
in 2000 with significant geographic variation. Curto et al. (2018) estimate a similar model using
more recent data and find that the program generated approximately $600 in total annual surplus,
with the majority captured by insurers. They also estimate that average MA plan costs are 12%
lower than TM costs, though in 47% of counties MA does not have a cost advantage over TM. Nosal
(2012) estimates a dynamic demand model of MA plan choice and finds very large switching costs—
$4,000 at the median. Aizawa and Kim (2018) estimate a demand model that is similar to ours in
order to explore the role of advertising in equilibrium selection. They analyze a counterfactual price
3

equilibrium when advertising is prohibited, but do not endogenize other product characteristics.
There is a literature examining the rate at which MA benchmark increases are passed through
to consumer surplus. Using an unanticipated change in the benchmark in 2000, Cabral et al. (2018)
estimate a passthrough rate of 54%, while Duggan et al. (2016) use variation in the benchmark
across urban and rural counties and estimate a smaller passthrough. Song et al. (2013) calculate
a passthrough from benchmarks to plan bids, which are a measure of premiums and the value of
benefits, of 53%. We expand upon this literature by considering firms’ choices of plan features, not
just premiums, in response to benchmark changes. In this way, our work is related to Fan (2013).
We also relate to recent work on optimal subsidy structures in different health insurance contexts. Tebaldi (2017), Jaffe and Shepard (2017) and Einav et al. (2018) examine the optimality of
different subsidy and/or risk-adjustment strategies in different ACA insurance exchanges. Ericson
and Starc (2015) examine the implications of age-based price regulation in an ACA-like insurance
exchange. Bundorf et al. (2012) study health-status-linked premiums in the employer-sponsored
setting. More broadly, we relate to a literature that considers various strategies designed to address
adverse selection—see Geruso and Layton (2017) for a review. MA subsidies are risk-adjusted, apparently successfully (Newhouse et al., 2015), and therefore we do not examine that issue here.
In addition to exploring the effectiveness of the risk-adjustment system, Decarolis et al. (2015)
examine the optimality of using vouchers verses the current subsidy strategy in Medicare Part D
and find that the two systems generate similar welfare. None of these papers examine the impact
of subsidies on non-premium plan characteristics.
We discuss the institutional details of the Medicare Advantage program in Section 2, and
provide simple examples of the optimal subsidy problem in Section 3. We detail our data on
Medicare beneficiaries and MA plans in Section 4. We present our full model in Section 5 and
estimate its parameters in Section 6. Section 7 describes our approach to counterfactual analysis,
and we present the results in Section 8. We conclude in Section 9.

The Medicare Advantage Program

Medicare was enacted in 1965. In its original form, the program provided health care to seniors (age
65 or older) through its Part A (hospital) and Part B (physician and outpatient) insurance programs,
respectively. Under its fee-for-service (FFS) structure, private providers treat beneficiaries and
Medicare pays the provider according to a pre-set reimbursement schedule while beneficiaries pay

4

applicable copays and/or coinsurance. In 1972 eligibility was expanded to include those who are
eligible for Social Security disability benefits and those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
Partly in response to the increasing costs of Medicare,2 in 1982 Congress authorized Medicare
administrators to engage in a series of “Part C” trials in which the government handed over management of the medical care of select groups of Medicare enrollees to private insurers in exchange
for a payment that did not vary with the realized medical expenditures of each individual.3 This
program was brought to the entire country in the early 1990s under the name Medicare+Choice.
The Medicare+Choice program struggled to attract plans and nationwide enrollment hovered
near 5 million – less than 10% of the Medicare population. Critics blamed low subsidy rates and
the fact that flat payments incentivized firms to cream-skim relatively healthy individuals from the
risk pool. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 aimed
to remove this incentive by adding a comprehensive risk adjustment component to the payment
mechanism. Under the new system, firms submit demographic and diagnostic data about enrollees
to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) at the time of enrollment. CMS assigns
each enrollee a score based on its FFS expenditures on similar individuals in Traditional Medicare
(TM). Payments to firms are then adjusted according to these risk scores. Proponents argued that
this mechanism would compensate firms for taking on risk without reimbursing specific procedures
– thus maintaining the profit motive which would (in theory) lead to cost reductions. The program
was renamed Medicare Advantage (MA). By 2015, 95% of Medicare beneficiaries had an MA plan
in their county and enrollments had increased to 16.3 million.4
A beneficiary who enrolls in an MA plan forgoes TM benefits and receives medical benefits
from the MA plan exclusively. MA enrollees pay the Medicare Part B premium and may pay a
private plan premium as well. Firms compete along the dimensions of benefit design, premia, and
provider networks, and often heavily market their plans (Aizawa and Kim, 2018). Firms also differ
in their organization. Most plans are offered by health maintenance organizations (HMOs), though
preferred provider organizations (PPOs) and private fee-for-service plans (PFFS) are also offered in
many locations. These firm types differ in their method of service delivery: HMOs generally deliver
care through providers who work directly for the firm, while PPOs form a network of independent
providers. PFFS plans offer a flat reimbursement rate per procedure, and providers may choose on
a case-by-case or service-by-service basis to accept patients. HMOs generally require recipients to

choose a primary care provider and obtain referrals to see specialists. PPOs may or may not require
referrals. Both types often require increased cost-sharing for ‘out-of-network’ service providers.
However, MA plans generally provide a more generous benefit package than TM, including benefit
categories not included under TM, such as dental and eye coverage. Many plans include a drug
benefit. Plans may also offer a reduction in the Part B premium.5
The enrollee-specific subsidy from CMS to insurers is based on a fixed “benchmark” rate for
each county, which varies significantly across geographies and over time (Newhouse et al., 2012).
CMS calculates the benchmark schedule each year by starting with the average risk-adjusted percapita FFS Medicare spending within the county.6 Counties are then ranked by average spending
and placed into quartiles. The benchmark rate for counties in the top quartile of FFS spending is
set to 95% of their average FFS spending. The benchmark rate for the second quartile is set to
100% of average FFS spending, the third quartile benchmark is 107.5% of average FFS spending,
and the bottom quartile is set to 115% of average FFS spending. A cap and floor that varies by
urban/rural status is applied to the benchmark rates.
Each year, after benchmarks are released, insurers submit plan-level ‘bids’ for particular counties. The bid for each plan represents the insurer’s offer to provide a stated set of benefits to a
person of average risk for the next year in exchange for a particular price. The final bid amount
must be related to the firm’s revenue requirements and may be above or below the benchmark rate.
Firms who bid above the benchmark rate must charge premiums to enrollees. Firms who bid below
the benchmark receive a portion of the difference as a ‘rebate’ that must be passed on to consumers
through increased benefits or lower Medicare Part B premiums. MA plans that offer a prescription
drug benefit submit a separate bid which maps in a similar way to a Part D premium.
At the beginning of our data, the rebate payment was equal to 75% of the difference between the
bid and the benchmark. In 2008, CMS introduced a system to measure insurer quality by assessing
performance along multiple dimensions and assigning a summary ‘star rating’ to firms. In 2012,
after multiple iterations of the criteria, CMS began using the rating to determine the rebate for
each plan. Under this new approach, firms with at least 4.5 stars (out of five) earn 70% of the
difference between the benchmark and the bid. New entrants and those with 3.5 or 4 stars earn
5

MA allows firms to register as ‘Regional PPOs’ if they cover all counties in a CMS-defined area – at minimum
an entire state. Regional PPOs face a slightly different payment policy than that described in this section, though
they set premiums and benefits similarly to other plans. For computational tractability, we assume Regional PPO
plans operate identically to other plans in our counterfactual simulation. As Regional PPO plans have a total market
share of 1.0% in our data, our results are not likely to be affected by this assumption.

This average is formed by adding the average Part A spending to the average Part B spending (as opposed to
the average sum of Part A and Part B spending).

65% of the difference. All others earn 50%. Additionally, firms with at least 4 stars have a 5%
bonus applied to the benchmark rate itself (CMS Office of the Actuary, 2017).
Beneficiaries can enroll in plans during an “Open Enrollment” period in the fall prior to the
plan year. Beneficiaries may also enroll in MA when they become newly Medicare eligible and
after “major” life changes (e.g. relocation, death in the family, etc.).7 After the enrollment period
closes, firms collect and transmit risk-adjustment information to CMS, which calculates the final
subsidies and begins monthly payments in January of the following year.
To summarize, the payment from CMS to insurers for an enrollee i living in county m enrolled
in plan j in year t based on a benchmark Bmt can be calculated with

(bid + λjt × (B × φ − bid )) × RiskAdjustment

where φjt captures any bonus to the benchmark rate and λjt is the rebate percentage, which may
vary with the rating. For simplicity, we denote the market-level (i.e. county-year level) benchmark
with Bm and denote risk-neutral (i.e. RiskAdjustment = 1.0) plan-specific payments with Bj .
MA is a significant component of the federal budget. In 2015, payments to plans in our data
were $98 billion – traditional Medicare spending on the individuals in our data totaled $298 billion.
MA is also relatively concentrated: the top four firms nationwide, United Health Group, Humana,
Kaiser, and Aetna, have 56% of total enrollment. The average beneficiary has access to 10 plan
options with 64% of beneficiaries having access to 5 or more plans. 25% of beneficiaries in our 2015
data have access to 3 or fewer plans. The average bid is 90% of TM costs (MedPAC, 2017).
Figure 1 illustrates the 2015 policy and the resulting market outcomes with county-level maps of
the US. The top map illustrates the ratio of the 2015 benchmark rate to the average FFS spending
in 2015. The bottom map illustrates the difference between the MA enrollment percentage in each
county and the national average. As consumer surplus is related to the total MA share, these
graphs offer a simple check of the current government policy. If private costs are tightly linked
to the government’s costs, and differences in those costs were the only source of heterogeneity
across markets, then we would expect those areas which had larger benchmarks (relative to FFS
spending) to have greater enrollment (relative to the national average). Instead, we see a significant
deviation from this pattern. Areas with high relative benchmarks, such as much of New Mexico,
7

More recently, enrollees have been allowed to switch to a “5 star” plan at anytime during the year.

7

do not have particularly high enrollment. Furthermore, those areas with high enrollment, such as
Minnesota and southwestern Pennsylvania, do not have particularly high relative benchmarks. We
thus conclude that there may be gains by redistributing government funds across counties.8

Simple Examples of the Optimal Subsidy Problem

Before moving to the full model, we present simple examples of the optimal subsidy problem described in Equation 1 which illustrate the gains that can be obtained by considering the interactions
between supply and demand conditions across markets over setting subsidies as a function of the
government’s cost alone. We focus on a discrete choice demand framework under monopoly, a
simplified version of the model of MA we will introduce in Section 5 to model MA.
In each market m, there exists a measure of consumers, denoted by i, and a single firm providing
a single product at price pm . Consumers choose either to buy the product offered by the firm or the
outside option of government provision. The utility of purchasing the good from the monopolist
is given by uim = αm pm + βm + im . In this equation, αm is a market-specific price sensitivity,
βm is a market-specific taste for the private good, and im is an per-consumer idiosyncratic taste
for the good. Let im be drawn from the Type-I extreme value distribution, and normalize the
utility of the outside good to zero. The probability that a consumer in market m purchases the
good, which we will refer to as the inside share of the good, is then given by sm =

exp(αm pm +βm )
1+exp(αm pm +βm ) .

Each market hosts a different monopolist firm, which faces marginal costs cm and chooses the price
pm knowing the consumer demand characteristics described above and the government policy Bm ,
which consists of a per-purchase payment. The firm’s profit-maximization problem is therefore
given by maxpm (pm − cm + Bm )sm (pm ).
If the consumer does not choose the private good, the government provides the good at a cost
of T Mm . Let sm (Bm ) be the inside share of the good at the profit-maximizing price under policy
Bm . The government’s expenditures are GovExpm (Bm ) = sm (Bm ) ∗ Bm + (1 − sm (Bm )) ∗ T Mm
and the consumer surplus is CSm (Bm ) =

1
αm

ln(1 + exp(αm p∗m (Bm ) + βm )). This “inclusive value”

form of consumer surplus is the amount consumers in market m would be willing to pay before
knowing their idiosyncratic taste to have the option to purchase the good (Small and Rosen, 1981).
Table 1 provides numeric solutions to Equation 1 for several combinations of markets. In each
example, markets differ by parameters {αm , βm , T Mm , cm }. We apply the MA benchmark policy

Notes: Data from CMS benchmark and enrollment files. The top map illustrates the ratio of the 2015 benchmark
rate to the 2015 risk-adjusted FFS spending in each county. To show detail, the data are windsorized at the 5th and
95th percentiles. The bottom graph shows the difference between the Medicare Advantage penetration rate in each
county and the overall penetration. Penetration is defined as the total number of people enrolled in any MA plan

had a higher percentage of Medicare eligibles enrolled in an MA plan than the national average.

M A . We calculate the government’s
described in Section 2 to obtain an initial subsidy schedule Bm

budget constraint under the MA policy and then solve for the optimal schedule holding the total
budget fixed. We compare the per-market benchmark rate, government expenditures, and consumer
surplus under the MA approach to the optimal approach. Across examples, the second market is
identical and has “average” characteristics taken across the other markets.
In Example (a) the market with the lowest T Mm has still lower cm and price sensitivity is
higher when costs are lower. The optimal policy takes advantage of the cost savings available in
the lowest-cost market and redistributes expenditures to the other two markets. The total consumer
surplus increases by 14.6%.
Example (b) changes the relationship between firm costs and the government’s costs – while firm
costs are still positively correlated with the government’s costs, firm costs are less extreme. In this
example, the optimal policy moves more money in percentage terms from the lowest-cost market
to pay for increases in the other two. The change in firm costs leads to a difference in the rank
order of market outcomes: while in Example (a) the lowest-cost market has the highest consumer
surplus, in Example (b) the highest-cost market has the highest consumer surplus. The optimal
policy changes the rank order of consumer surplus across markets and increases the total by 16%.
Example (c) duplicates the cost structure of Example (b) but reverses the relationship between
price sensitivity and costs. This change results in the highest changes in government expenditures
in percentage terms, as well as the largest increase (20.4%) in total consumer surplus.
Taken together, these examples illustrate important features of the optimal policy problem.
First, there is a disconnect between the benchmark rate and the realized government expenditures
and consumer surplus. Indeed, in Example (c) the optimal policy increases the benchmark rate and
government spending by the greatest percentage in the third market, yet consumer surplus improves
the most in percentage terms in the second market. As a corollary, the optimal policy depends not
only on the interactions between supply and demand conditions in any particular market, but on
the heterogeneity in those conditions across markets. While the second market is identical across all
three examples, the optimal benchmark rate and corresponding expenditures and consumer surplus
differ. Finally, all three examples illustrate significant improvements in consumer surplus over the
MA policy, despite differences in the relationship between firm costs and the government’s costs.

Notes: This table illustrates the solution to Equation 1 for sets of markets under the monopoly environment described
in Section 3. αm , βm , T Mm , and cm are the market-level price sensitivity, taste for the good, government’s marginal
cost, and the monopolist’s marginal cost, respectively. Bm is the benchmark rate set by the government, and CSm
and GovExpm are the consumer surplus and government expenditures in each market. In each example, we calculate
Bm using the MA policy described in Section 2 and use the total government expenditures as the budget constraint
for Equation 1. ∆% denotes the percentage change in the outcome from the MA policy to the optimal policy.

Data

We combine administrative data on plan characteristics and enrollment from CMS with micro-level
data on consumer choices from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey.

4.1

Medicare Advantage plans

Each year, CMS operates a Plan Finder website which allows consumers to compare the benefits of
plans offered in their location. We obtain the Plan Finder database from CMS for the years 2008 to
2015. We extract plan premiums, the Part B premium reduction (if any), copays and coinsurance
rates for primary care, specialist, and hospital visits, indicators for HMO, PPO, and PFFS plan
types, and indicators for vision, dental, and prescription drug coverage of any kind for each planyear. We also extract the county-level geographic coverage for each plan. We collect star ratings,
plan-level bids,9 and county-level benchmarks from other CMS sources. Finally, CMS releases
9

We do not observe the bids directly. Rather, we observe plan-level risk-adjusted payments, including the rebate
payment, county-level enrollments and benchmark rates. Combined with the payment rules described in Equation 2
and CMS rules for bids which cover multiple counties, we uniquely identify a bid for each plan-county.

11

enrollment counts each month for each county and plan. We average these monthly data over each
plan year and combine them with CMS counts of the number of people eligible for Medicare benefits
and not also eligible for Medicaid to form product shares at the plan-county-year level.
As part of the bidding and enrollment process, CMS calculates and publicizes out-of-pocket
cost (OOPC) estimates for each plan. CMS creates these estimates by forming a representative
bundle of services used by TM enrollees in different demographic groups. CMS then calculates the
out-of-pocket costs for that bundle under each plan’s benefit structure, which implicitly assumes
that service-level consumption patterns do not change between TM and MA. We collect the OOPC
estimate for each plan by age group (Under 65, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84, and Over 85) and health
status (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, and Poor).
We focus on the market for individual insurance described in Section 2, and drop plans sponsored
by employers and plans designed for individuals who are “dual-eligible” for Medicare and Medicaid,
as plans in these categories operate under a different payment system and benefit structure. Due
to CMS data restrictions, we drop plan-county observations with ten or fewer enrollees.10 For
consistent presentation, we report statistics for plans which fall within our micro-data sample area.
Table 2 presents the mean characteristics of our 50,593 plan-county-year observations separated
by benchmark quartiles calculated at the market (county-year) level. In the cross section, as
benchmarks increase observable plan benefits generally improve.11 The mean premium is $607 in
the first quartile, and $443 in the fourth. Dental coverage is included in 55% of plans in the lowest
quartile, and 69% of plans in the highest. Estimated out-of-pocket costs for a 75-79 year-old in
good health vary from $2,715 in the first quartile to $2,336 in the fourth. These differences in
benefits are correlated with differences in enrollment: average enrollment increases from 269 in the
first quartile to 1,039 in the fourth. The total market-level MA share increases from .149 to .259.
These patterns are not always monotonic: the average deductible decreases from $97.40 in
the first quartile to $87.30 in the second quartile before increasing to $102.39 in the third quartile.
These patterns reflect the fact that benchmarks are assigned to markets non-randomly as a function
of average TM costs in previous years. Though the costs faced by private firms are likely different
than average TM costs, they are certainly correlated and therefore the benchmark alone is an
insufficient statistic for understanding the behavior of firms.
10

CMS sources report that these observations are largely transient and created by individuals who move outside of
their plan’s service area.
11
Appendix Table C.1 presents unweighted and enrollment-weighted means across all observations. Appendix
Table C.2 uses the panel nature of our data and reports the correlation between year-over-year changes in the
benchmark and changes in same-plan product characteristics.

12

There are a number of potential explanations for this behavior. Traditionally, insurers are
thought to choose prices and plan features in response to the risk of adverse selection (Rothschild
and Stiglitz, 1976, Glazer and McGuire, 2000). A change in the benchmark rate could be seen as a
signal of a change in the risk distribution of consumers in the market, which could lead plans to try
to cream-skim by changing their product characteristics (Decarolis and Guglielmo, 2017) though
related work has found that the current implementation of the risk-adjustment system effectively
reduces incentives to cream-skim for cost reasons (Newhouse et al., 2015). Firms who engage in
diagnostic practices which result in larger risk-adjustment payments may set product characteristics
to encourage positive selection relative to opportunities to “upcode” (Geruso and Layton, 2018).
Alternatively, the menu of copays, coinsurance rates, and other product features may not be fully
salient to consumers (Curto et al., 2018). Finally, changes in the benchmark rate could result in
different insurer-provider bargaining outcomes (Ho and Lee, 2018), which in turn would affect the
marginal cost of specific services. We do not speculate about which of these mechanisms drives the
firm response, but simply note that all may lead a firm to choose product characteristics in part as
a function of the benchmark rate.

4.2

Medicare beneficiaries

Our individual-level data on Medicare beneficiaries come from the Medicare Current Beneficiary
Survey (MCBS), a rolling-panel survey of a nationally representative sample of beneficiaries sponsored by CMS and produced by Westat. Participants are interviewed multiple times per year over
three years, and responses are linked to CMS administrative and claims data to ensure accuracy.
We obtain the MCBS responses for 2008-2015.12 We observe detailed demographic information, including income, age, sex, race, and education. Respondents self-report their health status,
choosing between Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, and Poor. We transform these variables into
indicators for each demographic group that match the groups captured by the plan-level OOPC
estimates. We also observe the respondent’s county of residence and their MA plan, if any.13
The MCBS samples beneficiaries using a multi-level clustered procedure. First, several focus
geographies consisting of metropolitan statistical areas or groups of contiguous nonmetropolitan
counties are chosen randomly to reflect the diversity of urban and rural populations across the
12

The MCBS did not release data for 2014.
In some years, the MCBS does not report the plan choice directly and instead reports which firm the individual
has chosen, along with information about plan features and any premiums paid by the individual. We match this
data to the plan data to identify each individual’s choice.

Notes: An observation is a county-year-plan; all reported figures are unweighted means across observations in the
relevant quartile. The benchmark quartile is defined at the market (county-year) level. All dollar amounts are in
2015 dollars. The star rating is calcuated by CMS and ranges from zero to five. We obtain 30 out-of-pocket cost

United States. Within each focus area, beneficiaries are chosen at random to be representative
of the Medicare population as a whole. This procedure ensures that, although we do not observe
beneficiaries in every county in the country, within a geographic area there is considerable variation in demographics and plan enrollment. The MCBS provides sampling weights which we use
throughout our analysis to transform our results into a nationally representative form.
To model our MCBS micro-data as draws from the process that generates our plan-level enrollment data, we exclude any individuals who were eligible for Medicaid during the year, and those
with missing address information. After applying these exclusions, the sum of the sample weights
in the MCBS data differs from the sum of eligibles nationwide in our CMS data by less than 1%.
There are individuals in the MCBS data who do not fall into the standard set of Medicare
beneficiaries often studied in the literature: age 65-plus retirees without outside insurance (Curto
et al., 2018). However, these individuals are eligible to purchase MA plans and are therefore
included in CMS’ enrollment files. These include individuals with employer-provided insurance
plans, those whose original Medicare eligibility was not age-related, those with ESRD, and those
who are not full-year enrollees in Part A and Part B. As these individuals purchase MA plans,
we cannot exclude them without violating our model of the data-generating process. We instead
include them and create ‘administrative’ indicator variables to capture their behavior.
Those who do not enroll in MA have access to other insurance options, and variation in the price
of those options may make MA plans more or less attractive. We focus on Medicare supplemental
insurance (a.k.a. Medigap) which pays for care not covered by TM. For example, TM covers 80% of
the cost of physician visits, and a Medigap plan may pay for the rest. The design of Medigap plans
is standardized by CMS and indexed by letters: all “Plan A” policies across insurers offer the same
benefits. For each person, we obtain the rate for Medigap Plan C offered by United Healthcare that
year from Weiss Ratings. Plan C covers most of the coinsurance and deductibles that beneficiaries
are responsible for under TM and is the most popular Medigap plan.14
Summary statistics on our 58,444 individual-year observations covering 2,947 county-year markets and 32,993 unique individuals are reported in Table 3. The first two columns report means and
standard deviations across all observations. The mean age of individuals in our data is 73. Slightly
more than half of our observations are of females. Over 90% of individuals are coded by CMS as
White, with 7.9% Black and 1.0% Hispanic. Over 75% self-report “Good” or better health. 24%
14
Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin have alternative plan definitions; in those states we use the rate for
the plan closest to Plan C. Additionally, United Healthcare did not offer plans in New York during our study period.
For individuals in New York, we averaged the Plan C rates offered by all other insurers.

report having college degrees and 18% did not graduate high school. 33% receive some insurance
from a current or previous employer, and 16% are Medicare-eligible for reasons other than turning
65. The second set of columns splits the data by MA enrollment. On average, MA enrollees have
lower income, are less likely to be White, and have lower educational attainment. Individuals with
employer-provided insurance or with ESRD are less likely to be enrolled in MA.
The third and final set of columns of Table 3 illustrates the panel nature of our data and
focuses on panel observations for which the individual was enrolled in TM in the previous year –
23,278 observations total. We split the data into those who switched from TM to MA (4.3% of
observations), and those who remained on TM. Those who switched are generally similar to the
larger group of MA enrollees. Some differences are seen in health status – switchers from TM to
MA are slightly healthier on average than the broader MA population.

A Model of Medicare Advantage

Our model of MA builds upon the example introduced in Section 3 and leverages the rich individuallevel information in the MCBS and the detailed plan data from CMS. The demand side is inspired
by Goolsbee and Petrin (2004) and captures heterogeneity along multiple dimensions. In this sense,
our demand model is similar to that of Aizawa and Kim (2018) although we estimate parameters
with a different approach. On the supply side, we model multi-product insurers as profit-maximizers
that choose prices and product characteristics. We take the number of firms and products as given.
Each period t begins with the government choosing benchmarks Bm for each market m (defined
as a county) and Medigap insurers determining a price schedule {p0 }m . Bm maps to plan-specific
subsidies Bj via Equation 2 – the parameters φ and λ are taken to be exogenous. Firms f ∈ Fmt
publicly observe costs and then simultaneously choose for each of their plans j ∈ Jf product
characteristics {X, oopc, ξ}j and prices pj . Consumers, denoted by i, then choose a single plan or
the outside option of TM.

5.1

Demand

Consumers have demographic characteristics zi which include income bracket g and age-and-healthstatus type h. Let gi and hi be indicators which are equal to one if consumer i is a member of
group g or h, respectively.
Consumers enter the period enrolled in plan k. We define three indicators Ssij to capture the

Notes: An observation is a person-year. Statistics reported here are weighted according to sampling weights provided
by the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). Income and prices are in 2015 dollars. The outside good price
is the United Healthcare premium for Medigap Plan C (see text for details). Demographic categories are defined by
CMS administrative data. The first set of two columns reports means and standard deviations for all observations
in the microdata. The third and fourth columns split the observations into those enrolled in MA and those enrolled
in TM. The last two columns split the observations by switching behavior. Only those person-year observations for
which we observed the individual enrolled in TM in last year’s MCBS are included in the these last columns.

effects of this previous enrollment. Let S1ij be equal to one if k is the outside good – we call this
the Medicare-to-MA indicator. Let S2ij – the MA Interfirm indicator – be one if k is offered by a
different firm than j. Finally, let S3ij – the MA Intrafirm indicator – be one if k is offered by the
same firm as j but k and j are different products.
Let uijmt denote the consumer’s utility from enrolling in a particular plan j. Dropping the

In this equation, α + αg captures price sensitivity for income group g. βh captures the impact
of expected out-of-pocket costs for that consumer’s specific age-health group hi . βsh captures
switching costs and varies by health group. βz captures heterogeneous tastes for MA versus TM.
β captures mean tastes for plan characteristics Xj .
As is standard in random utility demand systems, we decompose the unobservable (to the
econometrician) portion of utility into two components. ξj represents the portion of unobserved
plan utility that is common across individuals. ij represents the idiosyncratic taste of consumer i
for plan j which is assumed to be drawn independently from the Type-I extreme value distribution.15
We allow the utility of the outside good to vary with the price schedule of supplemental insurance
{p0 }, which we denote at the individual level by p0i , through
ui0 = β0 pi0 + i0 .

(4)

We normalize the outside good by subtracting β0 pi0 from each uij .
We include switching costs due to the consistent finding of inertia in plan enrollment (Nosal,
2012, Aizawa and Kim, 2018).16 Enrollees in MA face a different set of benefits and provider
networks than in TM and those details vary across insurers and plans. Switching between plans
entails learning about administrative procedures and provider networks. In addition, Medicare
15

We have explored demand systems with persistent idiosyncratic tastes and found similar results.
Like Aizawa and Kim (2018), we do not model consumers as dynamic for several reasons. First, such analysis
is computationally intensive. Second, it likely requires assuming that individuals choose according to a model of
neoclassical preferences with a discount factor close to one. However, recent work has shown that in related settings
that model does not explain Medicare beneficiary behavior well (e.g. Dalton et al., 2018). Third, Nosal (2012)
estimates such a model and finds extremely high (perhaps implausibly so) switching costs. Fourth, our estimation
approach captures the inertia that is salient for our counterfactual analysis.

beneficiaries are automatically re-enrolled in their previous plan if they take no action during their
open enrollment period – it is virtually costless to re-enroll. Similar to Handel (2013), we model
P
these costs with a direct utility impact through the s βs Ssij term.17
The vector of plan characteristics Xj includes the the plan’s deductible, out-of-pocket limit,
copay and coinsurance rates, indicators for supplemental coverage, and the other characteristics
included in Table C.1. We also include the Part B premium reduction in Xj as consumers may
respond differently to rebates than they do to premiums – a ‘kinked’ demand response similar to
that of Curto et al. (2018). However, the presence of the expected out-of-pocket costs, which are
calculated by CMS in part as a function of these product characteristics, changes the interpretation
of the β coefficient – β captures the mean taste for plan features conditional on the overall level of
out-of-pocket expenditures.
Following Berry et al. (1995), it is useful to rewrite the utility uij into a product-level mean
δj = α0 pj + βXj + ξj

where αi is the price sensitivity of i. As in Section 3, this is the amount i would be willing to pay
to have the choice of MA plans, relative to a world in which TM was the only option – it does not
include the benefit of TM itself.
17

If an enrollee’s previous plan is no longer available and the enrollee does not select a plan, the previous insurer
may ‘crosswalk’ the enrollee to the most similar offered plan. We set intra-firm switching costs to zero in these cases.

19

5.2

Supply

Firms start each period with common knowledge of the distribution of consumer demographics,
including enrollment status, the per-enrollee subsidy they receive Bj , and each others costs.18 We
model marginal costs as log-linear in observed characteristics rj (which includes Xj and oopcj and
possibly other observables) and some unobserved (to the econometrician) component ωj with
ln(mcj ) = γr rj + ωj .

(9)

Given these costs and the demand model above, the profit maximization problem for firm f is

j∈Jf

This maximization problem is written with respect to the set of vectors {pf , Xf , oopcf , ξf } to
indicate that firms choose these attributes for all of their products simultaneously.19 sij depends
on the characteristics of all products in the market; θ is the vector of demand system parameters.

6

Estimation

We estimate the parameters of the demand system following the approach of Goolsbee and Petrin
(2004). First, we estimate parameters which capture individual-level variation – those parameters
that define µ0ij – with a maximum likelihood approach. We then estimate the parameters common
to individuals – those parameters that define δj – with an instrumental variables approach.
Let θI = {αg , βh , βs , βsh , βz , β0 } be the set of parameters which comprise µ0ij . For a given
candidate value θ̃ we use the Berry (1994) inversion and find the unique set of product fixed effects
δj (θ̃) that match predicted shares to observed market shares. Let Cij be an indicator variable that
is equal to one if person i chose product j.20 We form the likelihood function
C

Li (Cij ; θ̃, δ(θ̃)) = Πj sijij ,
18

(11)

We do not explicitly model bidding though we account for it in our counterfactual approach. See Section 7.
In practice, firms do not directly choose each of the OOPC measures as they are calculated by CMS. The plan
characteristics we observe capture 38% of the variation in the OOPC measures and therefore it is practical to model
these as separate choices made by firms rather than as functions of other observables.
20
Calculating Cij involves two complications. First, the variables in the MCBS vary from year to year and we are
not always able to recover a unique choice. Second, we model utility as a function of past enrollment, and the rolling
panel design implies that a fraction of our observations have no past enrollment data. We address this by eliminating
plans given what we do observe and taking draws from the conditional shares of the remaining products.
19

20

where sij is given by Equation 7. In the first stage of our estimation procedure, we apply the MCBS
sample weights wi and maximize the weighted log likelihood function
l(C; θ̃) =

X

ln(Li )wi ,

(12)

i

At the point estimate θ̂ we store the unique δ̂j and regress it on observable product characteristics according to Equation 5. We recover marginal cost parameters by inverting the firms’
first-order conditions for price and estimating Equation 9.

6.1

Identification

Since ξj is observed by firms but not by us, it is likely to be correlated with the price and other
characteristics of the plan. To identify the coefficients α0 and β, we make the common assumption
that the unobservable product characteristic ξj is uncorrelated with the observed product characteristics Xj . This implies both that β is identified and that instruments formed as functions of the
Xj are valid for price — we use the summation instruments of Berry et al. (1995).
One potential concern is the fact that firms choose ξj and Xj simultaneously as a function of the
benchmark, which implies that these characteristics may be correlated through this mutual dependency. Our data captures a wealth of detail about plan benefits, and thus the largest components
of ξ are likely to be local network breadth, advertising (which may occur at the local or regional
level), and unobservable quality. These are unlikely to change in response to small changes in the
benchmark, and thus it is reasonable to assume that ξj is uncorrelated with Bj . We test this by
estimating ξˆj and computing its correlation with Bj . Some of the components of ξj are likely to be
constant across plans within a given firm21 , and so we include firm fixed effects in Xj .
Firms face state and federal regulations which change over time suggesting there may be some
component of marginal cost which is constant across firms within a state-year. Following the logic
of Hausman et al. (1994) we use average prices in other counties as additional price instruments.
Since plans are often offered at the same price in geographically contiguous counties, we calculate
this instrument using “non-contiguous counties” – that is, for a plan in a county, we calculate the
average price of plans in counties of the same state which do not share borders with the county
under consideration.
Just as ξj is likely to be correlated with pj , it is also likely to be correlated with firm costs.
21

Indeed, Aizawa and Kim (2018) make the assumption ξj = ξf for all plans offered by the same firm.

21

However, after estimating the demand parameters, we can calculate a ξˆj for each plan and include
it in rj . We estimate Equation 9 by assuming that any unobservable components of cost are
uncorrelated with ξˆj and our observables.

consumers are less price sensitive than low income consumers. Out-of-pocket costs create disutility,
while an increase in the cost of Medigap drives consumers to MA plans. Non-White individuals
have a stronger preference for MA plans, as do individuals with lower levels of education. Our
administrative indicators enter with appropriate signs and reasonable magnitudes.
The bottom rows of Table 4 report switching cost parameters. We interact each switching cost
with indicators for self-reported health status, with ‘Poor’ as the excluded group. The highest
costs are incurred by consumers switching from TM to MA. Inter-firm switches are less costly and
intra-firm switches are cheaper still. These results suggest the primary component of switching
costs is the disutility of changing providers. While being in better than ‘Poor’ health appears to
have an impact on the costs of switching from TM to MA, the interaction terms do not enter with
significance for either of the other switching cost types.
Table 5 reports estimates of Equation 5. The first column presents the OLS estimates and the
second presents IV results. Consistent with OLS estimates on price being biased towards zero, the
IV price coefficient is larger in magnitude than the OLS coefficient. For this reason, we concentrate
our attention on the IV specification.22 These estimates in general correspond to sensible priors.
For the plans with a positive premium the average plan elasticity is -2.66.23 The average semielasticity of increasing premiums $1 is .3 percent, similar to estimates from the literature. For
example, using an earlier sample period, Aizawa and Kim (2018) estimate an average MA semielasticity of .75 percent. We also test the null hypothesis that ξj is uncorrelated with Bj . The
empirical correlation coefficient is −0.0025 and so we cannot reject the null hypothesis.
The presence of CMS OOPC estimates in the first stage, which are in part a function of these
variables, changes the interpretation of these parameters. The parameters estimated here are not
22

We do not include star ratings in this specification for two reasons. First, they are generally calculated at the firm
level, and so are largely picked up by firm fixed effects. Second, CMS changed the definition of the ratings several
times throughout the sample period, increasing the noise in the measure.
23
An important issue in the proposed Aetna-Humana merger was the rate of substitution between MA and TM if
insurers were to increase premiums. We find that a $100 increase in all plan premiums (or $8.33 per month), holding
everything else constant, results in a 5.6% shift in enrollees from MA to traditional Medicare.

Notes: This table reports maximum likelihood estimates of the individual-specific components of Equation 3. In the
estimation, each individual receives the estimated out-of-pocket cost (OOPC) for their age-health demographic group
(e.g. 70-74 Good). Income groups are defined by terciles of the income distribution for the entire MCBS sample; low
income is the omitted group. The omitted group for the switching cost interactions is ‘Poor’ health. We weight the
likelihood function using the MCBS sample weights to obtain nationally representative estimates.

23

the direct effect of these features per se, but rather their impact on utility holding expected OOPC
constant. In that light, our results indicate that consumers prefer to incur out-of-pocket costs on
copays and coinsurance, rather than deductibles. Consumers prefer expenditures on plan benefits to
reductions in Medicare Part B premiums. While prescription drug coverage is valued by consumers,
vision and dental coverage isn’t. PPOs are preferred to HMOs.
Appendix Table C.3 reports the mean switching cost by type and income group calculated by
dividing the switching cost coefficients by the price coefficient for each person. The cost incurred
by an average medium-income individual switching from TM to MA is $918, which is almost twice
the mean annual premium in our data, while the same average individual switching between plans
within an MA insurer incurs a cost of only $177, about a third of the average annual premium.
Table 6 reports estimates of Equation 9. As the OOPC measures for different groups are highly
collinear we focus on the median OOPC, the measure for a 65-69 year old in Good health – the
results are similar when using alternative OOPC measures. We include firm and county fixed
effects to focus on the costs of different plan designs and to account for costs which stem from
geography. The major cost sharing plan design parameters, including the OOPC, deductibles, and
out-of-pocket limits, enter with the correct sign. Offering prescription drugs increases costs by 3.9%.
The coefficient on the demand unobservable is positive and significant at the 1% level, suggesting
that specifications which did not take the correlation between demand and cost unobservables into
account would be biased. As with the demand system, the copay and coinsurance parameters must
be interpreted in the context of the overall OOPC parameter. HMOs face lower costs than PPOs.
There has been some discussion about the usefulness of structural techniques for estimating
costs and counterfactual outcomes (e.g. Angrist and Pischke, 2010, Nevo and Whinston, 2010).
Criticism has focused on the use of demand elasticities and first-order conditions to calculate
marginal costs. In our setting, CMS reports the actual risk-adjusted per-capita TM expenditures
in each market, which, if our estimation approach is consistent, are likely to be correlated with
our estimated marginal costs. We mimic the spirit of an exercise in Curto et al. (2018, fig. 4)
and compare the share-weighted estimated MA cost to TM costs at the county level for 2015 in
Appendix Figure C.3. The two cost measures are positively correlated with a coefficient of .527;
on average, estimated MA costs are lower than TM costs.

Optimal Geographic Variation in Medicare Advantage Subsidies

We now turn to the problem of setting the benchmark rates to maximize the consumer surplus
generated by MA keeping government expenditures constant. To update the notation of Equation 1
to our full model, let Bm be the benchmark rate for a particular market, CSim (B) be the equilibrium
consumer surplus for consumer i in market m when the benchmark rate is B, and GovExpm (B)
be the equilibrium total government expenditures on the Medicare program in market m including
both TM and MA. B̄ is the total budget available to the government. We consider three types of
optimal subsidy problems given by

The first equation maximizes consumer surplus subject to a government budget constraint and
is analogous to Equation 1. As we document below, the solution creates winners and losers across
markets which may not be politically feasible to implement. For this reason, Equation 14 penalizes
the variance in consumer surplus across individuals – α ∈ [0, 1] determines the relative weight on
consumer surplus versus the variance in consumer surplus. We also search for a “Pareto improving”
policy with Equation 15 by minimizing government expenditures subject to the constraint that
benchmarks in each market (and therefore consumer surplus) stay at least at the level of current
policy represented by B̄m .
Solving these problems requires calculating the CS and GovExp functions. Given prices and
product characteristics as a function of Bm , CS(Bm ) comes from Equation 8. Expenditures are

where P aymentjm is the plan-level payment of Equation 2, sij is the share function of Equation 7,
and T Mm is the average per-enrollee TM spending in the market. As we do not observe individualspecific risk scores, we calculate MA and TM spending using the average risk level in the market —
in other words, we set RiskAdjustmentit = RiskAdjustmentmt in Equation 2 for all i. We treat
27

T Mm as exogenous due to the risk adjustment system – MA enrollment patterns do not change
average risk-adjusted TM spending. Since the benchmark and rebate adjustment terms, φjt and
λjt , are determined by previous firm performance, we take them as given.

7.1

An equilibrium approximation approach to counterfactual analysis

The inputs to CS and GovExp are prices and product characteristics in each market as a function
of the benchmark. A traditional counterfactual approach would derive policy functions by varying
the benchmark and searching for Nash equilibria, usually through analyzing firms’ first-order conditions for profit maximization. For example, Fan (2013) uses this approach to find a post-merger
equilibrium in prices and five product characteristics in a daily newspaper market with five competitors – a total of 30 first-order conditions. However, as each plan in our data has 48 characteristics
and the average market has 14 plans, solving for a single equilibrium in one market involves a fixed
point search across 672 first-order conditions requiring significantly greater computational effort
(Daskalakis et al., 2009). To find an optimal policy, we must search over hundreds of equilibria in
each of the 445 markets in the 2015 data, a computationally infeasible task.
Our alternative “equilibrium approximation” approach combines policy function estimation
with a reduced-dimension fixed-point problem. Our approaches hinges on observing variation in
the benchmark – the key primitive we wish to change in the counterfactual – in the data both
across markets and over time. As discussed above, CMS sets the benchmark each according to
risk-adjusted TM expenditures alone and so the benchmark is exogenous from the firm’s perspective. Table 2 shows this variation in the benchmark comes with variation in observed product
characteristics – the data trace out policy functions. To predict counterfactual characteristics, we
regress observed characteristics on the benchmark (and other covariates) and use the fitted values
at counterfactual benchmarks to update product characteristics. We then solve for prices in a
Bertrand Nash game.
Our approach pools data from different markets and so we adopt the Equilibrium Selection (ES)
assumption of Bajari et al. (2007): we assume that firms across markets play the same equilibrium
strategies with respect to the benchmark. While this assumption may be concerning when markets
are geographically isolated (Noel, 2007), our data is characterized by firms offering products in
multiple overlapping geographies. We therefore conclude that the existence of isolated markets
with widely disparate equilibrium behavior is unlikely.
We build on past efforts to use policy function estimation for counterfactual analysis. Goolsbee
28

and Petrin (2004) study competition between pay television systems and use estimated functions for
prices and product characteristics to calculate the welfare improvement caused by the introduction
of satellite TV. Benkard et al. (2018) estimate strategic entry and exit behavior in the airline
industry and simulate industry outcomes under counterfactual merger scenarios. We extend these
efforts by combining our estimated policy functions with our demand model to solve for a Nash
equilibrium in prices and calculate the welfare effects of changes in the government policy.
We simplify the problem by defining a ‘price-adjusted quality’ δ 0 for each plan given by
δj0 = δj − α0 pj .

(17)

As firm costs and characteristics are asymmetric, it is unlikely that a symmetric equilibrium
exists (Hefti, 2017). We therefore regress δj0 on the benchmark, firm fixed effects, and other variables
designed to capture potential sources of asymmetry across plans. We include the ‘rank’ of δj0 with
respect to the firm’s other plans to capture the fact that firms offer multiple plans with different
levels of generosity at different price points, an indicator which is one if the insurer has the highest
share in the market, and the total number of plans in the market. We use the same variables to
capture variation in each of the OOPC terms.
Given a benchmark for a market, we use our estimated policy functions to calculate the new δ
and updated OOPC for each plan in that market. We take the difference between the estimated
policy at the new benchmark and the estimated policy at the observed benchmark and apply that
difference to the observed policy. This adds flexibility to our approximation and maintains planlevel heterogeneity without adding terms to our regressions. We apply a similar approach to other
primitives by estimating marginal cost as a function of δ 0 and OOPC, consistent with our model,
and estimating the bid as a function of marginal cost, consistent with CMS bidding rules.
With the set of product characteristics, costs, and bids in hand, we calculate prices by iterating
over the

∂sj
∂pj

matrix. We implement this solver with a non-negativity restriction on prices to capture

the kink in the CMS payment design (Equation 2). These rules – using the differences in the policy
functions and the non-negativity restriction on prices – make our counterfactual and estimation
approaches consistent in the sense that when we calculate equilibria at the benchmarks in the data,
the outcomes (prices, product characteristics, shares, etc.) match the data precisely.
To summarize, given a benchmark for a given county, we calculate CSm and GovExpm with
the following steps:

29

1. Use the estimated policy functions to calculate δj0 and oopcj for each plan.
2. Use the estimated marginal cost and bid functions with the new product characteristics to
calculate mcj and bidj .
3. Taking as given these new characteristics and costs, solve for the new equilibrium in prices.
4. Given the new prices and characteristics, calculate consumer surplus with Equation 8 and
government spending with Equation 16.
We now have the ingredients of the maximization problems posed by Equations 13, 14, and 15.
As we find equilibria numerically, we cannot solve for the constraint surface analytically and instead
we satisfy the constraint numerically using a penalty function. Across these problems, both the
objective function and the constraint are non-linear and so we address the possibility of multiple
local maxima with a multistart procedure inspired by Rinnooy Kan and Timmer (1987).
We do not model the impact of subsidies on plan entry and exit due to the computational effort
required. However, incorporating entry and exit into the analysis should not significantly impact
the results as the plans that enter and exit in our sample comprise a small share of the total MA
market and thus contribute little to consumer surplus. The average share of exiters in the year before
they exit is 0.62%. The average share of new entrants upon entry is 0.72% and the average share
two years later is 1.1%. As our counterfactual benchmarks are within the support of the current
benchmark distribution, the role (or lack thereof) of past entry and exit on consumer surplus should
be informative about its impact on consumer surplus in the counterfactuals. Decarolis et al. (2015)
use a similar logic in their analysis of Medicare Part D. Maruyama (2011) studies entry and pricing
in Medicare+Choice but does not endogenize product characteristics.

We apply our approach to solve optimal subsidy problems for our 2015 sample. We present our
estimated policy functions and then present our primary exercise in which we maximize average
consumer surplus. We also discuss alternative objective functions.

Notes: The independent variables are the δ 0 defined by Equation 17 and the CMS OOPC estimates by age and health
status. The benchmark is at the market level. The plan rank variable is the rank of the plan within its insurer,
ordered by the value of the δ 0 , with 1 as the top-ranked plan. The leading insurer indicator is equal to 1 if the firm has
the highest total share in the market. Estimates are obtained via OLS. Robust standard errors are in parentheses.

Column (3), our preferred specification, controls for the rank of the plan, an firm-level indicator for
high market share, and the number of plans in the market. The benchmark enters with a positive
sign, and the R2 is .514.24 Columns (4)-(6) report estimates for three OOPC policy functions using
an analogous specification; Appendix Table C.4 reports estimates for all thirty OOPC. In general,
increases in the benchmark lead to decreases in estimated OOPC, and these decreases are larger
for those who are older and those in worse health. R2 s range from .210 to .312.
To complete our set of plan primitives, we regress marginal cost on product characteristics
and the plan bid on the marginal cost. For both, we include insurer and county fixed effects.
For consistency with our other estimates, the left-hand side variables are in levels.25 The first
column of Table 8 reports the parameter estimates for marginal cost. As with Table 6, we include
only one OOPC for simplicity. Increasing the δ 0 leads to an increase in the marginal cost, and
increasing the OOPC decreases the marginal cost. The second column reports estimates for the
bid. The coefficient on marginal costs in less than one, which is sensible given CMS bidding rules
– in particular the requirement that bids reflect the cost of providing TM-equivalent benefits.
24

For comparison, Goolsbee and Petrin (2004) report an R2 of .187 for their analogous exercise (Table 9), and
Benkard et al. (2018) report pseudo-R2 s ranging from .125 to .999 across a range of similar exercises.
25
We repeated the counterfactual exercise with these functions in logs instead of levels and obtained similar results.

Maximizing consumer surplus

Table 9 reports the results of our primary counterfactual exercise. The first column reports surplus
under the 2015 policy across a number of dimensions. The mean consumer surplus unconditional
on MA enrollment is $148.65. The MA program generates a total of $5.94 billion in consumer
surplus per year. The second column reports the results of solving Equation 13 and the third
column calculates percentage changes between the two policies. The optimal policy increases mean
surplus by 29.6% to $192.65; the aggregate surplus increases to $7.70 billion. These changes are
driven more by the total share of MA, which increases 23.6% from 26.7% to 33.0%, than by the
consumer surplus conditional on enrollment, which increases 4.99% from $556.02 to $583.74.26
The second panel of Table 9 splits markets by the direction of the benchmark change relative
to the 2015 policy. The optimal policy increases the benchmark in 334 out of the 445 markets in
our sample, and in those markets the mean surplus increases from $124.09 to $200.99, while in the
111 markets where the benchmark is lower, the mean surplus decreases from $222.40 to $167.61. In
other words, the optimal policy improves upon the 2015 policy by increasing the consumer surplus
where the existing surplus is low, rather than areas where existing surplus is high.
The third panel examines the changes by demographic groups. White consumers receive a
greater increase in mean consumer surplus than do Black consumers, while Hispanic consumers
experience a decrease. Changes are roughly constant across income groups.

Notes: This table reports results of the solution to the optimal subsidy problem presented in Section 7. The first
column reports data for the 2015 policy. The second column reports the results of maximizing consumer surplus per
Equation 13. Consumer surplus is calculated via Equation 8; surplus figures are in dollars per Medicare-beneficiaryyear. White, Black, and Hispanic groups are defined by CMS. All results are weighted by MCBS sample weights.

The benchmark changes are detailed in Figure 2. The left-hand histogram illustrates the distribution of benchmarks under the optimal policy, and can be compared to Appendix Figure C.1.
The right-hand histogram shows the distribution of changes in the benchmark. The changes are
generally modest – the interquartile range of the difference between the optimal and 2015 benchmarks is from $0 to $658. The mean change is $330 and the median is $267. In percentage terms,
over 90% of the changes in the benchmark are of less than 10% than the 2015 benchmarks.
The magnitude of the changes in the mean surplus across markets in which the benchmark
increases and markets in which the benchmark decreases suggests that the aggregate changes in
these markets are also substantial. Table 10 reports the aggregate consumer surplus and government
spending on TM and MA under the 2015 policy and the optimal policy, split by the direction of
the optimal policy change. The aggregate consumer surplus increases in markets with benchmark
increases from $3.72 billion per year to $6.03 billion per year. This change comes with a decrease in
spending on TM from $235.2 billion to $202.5 billion, and an increase in MA spending from $66.2

billion to $99.7 billion.27 Aggregate consumer surplus decreases in the other markets from $2.22
billion to $1.67 billion, while spending transfers from MA to TM.
The construction of our optimal subsidy problem implies that markets should be selected for
increases and decreases based upon the marginal impact of an increase in the benchmark rate on
consumer surplus and government expenditures. Table 11 reports the distribution of the derivatives
of consumer surplus, government expenditures, and total surplus (defined as consumer surplus
minus government expenditures) with respect to a $1 increase in the benchmark rate. The first
subtable focuses on markets in which the benchmark increases, and the second subtable focuses on
benchmark decreases. Within each, the top panel presents derivatives of the surplus and spending
unconditional on MA enrollment, while the bottom panel conditions on MA enrollment.
The distributions of both the conditional and unconditional consumer surplus derivatives overlap
across the groups of markets, suggesting that potential changes in consumer surplus alone do not
drive the results. In contrast, both the distributions of the derivatives of government expenditures
in isolation and the distributions of the total surplus derivatives are more separated across the
two sets of markets. Indeed, of the 334 markets with benchmark increases, 228 have positive
total surplus derivatives, and every market with a benchmark decrease has a negative total surplus
derivative. In Appendix B, we explore the non-local behavior of our surplus and spending functions.
Given the importance of these derivatives to determining the direction of benchmark changes, a
27

This transfer of resources from TM to MA may generate concerns about externalities with respect to the government’s bargaining power. However, as the government largely sets Medicare reimbursement rates nationally, with
local cost-of-living adjustments, these externalities are likely to be small over the range of TM and MA enrollment
shares estimated in our counterfactuals.

natural question is the extent to which market-level observables can explain the variance we see in
these benchmarks. In addition to our county-level measures of TM costs, the number of Medicare
beneficiaries, and the number of MA firms, we obtain county-level data from the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services’ Area Health Resources File (AHRF). The AHRF combines data
from a number of U.S. government and non-profit sources to provide a detailed view of healthrelevant information at the county-year level. We collect median household income, the percentage
of seniors in severe poverty, the unemployment rate, population density, and per-capita counts
of MDs, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and hospice facilities. We also collect the hospital
readmission rate for Medicare patients and the “preventable” hospital admission rate.28
We model the market-level derivatives of the consumer surplus and government expenditure
functions as a linear function of these observables. Columns (1) and (2) of Table 12 present
standardized regression coefficients when the dependent variable is the derivative of consumer
surplus and government expenditures, respectively. Across the two regressions, TM costs, measures
of competition, income, and risk appear as strongly related to the derivatives. In total this model
explains 31% (55%) of the variance in the derivative of consumer surplus (government expenditures).
A related question is the extent to which these variables can be used to generate linear policy
rules. Column (3) of Table 12 uses the same observables to model the optimal benchmark in each
28

Appendix Table C.5 reports the means of these variables by benchmark quartile for the 2015 and optimal policies.

county. The optimal benchmark is most strongly associated with measures of competition, cost,
and income.29 Table 13 compares the optimal policy to the policy generated by the fitted values
of this regression. The linear rule reduces consumer surplus relative to the optimal policy by 4.4%,
and increases government spending by 0.5%. Under this rule, 317 markets receive benchmark
increases, and 128 markets receive benchmark decreases. The second panel of Table 13 shows that,
in general, the linear rule results in increases and decreases that are “too large” relative to the
optimal policy; consumers in markets which receive increases (decreases) receive even more (less)
surplus than under the optimal policy.

implications if the changes result in a large-scale redistribution of government expenditures and
consumer surplus dollars from states with one political alignment to states with an opposing alignment. To explore these issues, we summarize the total consumer surplus and government expenditures by state in Appendix Table C.6. Of the 41 states (plus Washington D.C.) included in
the MCBS, 35 receive aggregate increases in consumer surplus; only Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana,
Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Wisconsin experience decreases. Other southern states including
Alabama, Georgia, North and South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia receive increases. These results
suggest the optimal policy does not split along political divisions.
While our approach finds an equilibrium in prices taking product characteristics as given, there
may be approximation error in our simulated outcomes coming from errors in our policy functions.
To investigate this, we calculate the change in variable profits firms would obtain by deviating
from the predicted policy functions for out-of-pocket costs and the adjusted δ term by 1%. As
we estimate marginal costs by inverting the first-order conditions related to price alone, we do

38

not expect the first-order conditions for the other product characteristics to hold precisely at the
observed 2015 values. To isolate the error introduced by our approximation approach, we calculate
the change in profits for deviations from the estimated characteristics at the optimal policy and
subtract it from the change in profits for deviations from the observed 2015 characteristics.
The results are reported in Appendix Table C.8. Across all markets, the mean change in
profit from a 1% increase in out-of-pocket costs is -0.03%, and the mean change in profit from
an increase in the adjusted δ term is 0.05%, indicating that our approximation approach does not
introduce significant error on average. The Monte Carlo results in Appendix A suggest that any
approximation error may vary in part based on the change in the benchmark; those markets with
greater changes may have a greater approximation error. The last rows of Appendix Table C.8 split
markets into those with changes in the benchmark of more and less than $1,000. As expected, the
57 markets with changes greater than $1,000 have slightly more profitable deviations – the mean
change in variable profit from a 1% change in adjusted δ is 0.20%.
Finally, we quantify the importance of the product characteristic channel in Appendix Table C.9
by calculating the consumer surplus when prices are set to the equilibrium level under the optimal
policy but product characteristics are held at observed 2015 levels. On average, the change in the
product characteristics contributes roughly 3% to the overall change in consumer surplus, though
this rate varies across demographic groups.

8.3

Alternative social welfare functions

The results in the previous subsection show the optimal policy creates winners and losers relative to
the current policy. We explore a number of other social welfare functions in Table 14 and compare
the policies generated by these functions to the optimal policy. Columns (2) and (3) maximize
consumer surplus with a penalty assessed on the variance of consumer surplus across individuals.
In Column (2), the penalty on variance causes a reduction in benchmarks nearly everywhere in order
to fund increases in a few of markets; the total consumer surplus drops from $5.94 billion under
the 2015 policy to $2.91 billion. Column (3) reduces the penalty on the variance, which results in
a policy very similar to the optimal policy. Relative to the optimal policy, total consumer surplus
falls 3.63% to $7.42 billion. Appendix Figure C.4 illustrates the optimal benchmark distribution
under this scenario. 83% of counties receive increases, and the interquartile range extends from $5
to $763. In percentage terms, the increases are similar – 75% are of less than 10%.
Column (4) seeks to minimize government expenditures. Where the 2015 MA payments are
39

larger than the cost of TM, this is done by reducing the benchmark. However, there are markets
where the 2015 policy results in MA payments that are on average lower than TM costs. Increasing
the benchmark results in both intensive and extensive margin changes to MA payments: the government must pay more for consumers who were already enrolled in an MA plan, and must transfer
payments from the TM system to the MA system for consumers who switch. In 164 markets,
the extensive margin impact is larger than the intensive margin impact, and therefore an increase
in the benchmark rate results in a decrease in total government expenditures.30 As a result, the
government can reduce total spending on TM and MA by 0.5%, though at the cost of 19.9% of
consumer surplus relative to the 2015 policy.
Column (5) seeks a “Pareto improvement” by minimizing government expenditures subject to
the constraint that no benchmark is lowered below its 2015 level. As the benchmark is raised in
164 markets, total consumer surplus increases 10.0% from the 2015 policy to $6.54 billion. At the
same time, government spending is reduced by roughly $1 billion.

Conclusion

Seeking to reduce the perceived inefficiency of government-provided goods and services, policy makers in a number of contexts have implemented public-private partnerships in which the government
provides subsidies to private firms that are tied to the choices of consumers. The firms are then free
to compete with each other – with competition and market forces working to bring down the total
cost and increase the benefits of providing the good over time. In many cases, the goods provided
by firms have differentiated characteristics which are relevant to consumers. Additionally, these
goods may be offered in geographies with consumers who have substantially different preferences.
While the subsidy rates are generally set according to measures of government costs, the optimal
subsidies conditional on a fixed budget depend on equilibrium interactions between heterogeneous
supply and demand conditions.
We provide a framework for calculating the optimal subsidies that takes into account both the
supply and demand responses to alternative subsidy rates. We model demand with a discrete-choice
system and avoid the curse of dimensionality in product characteristics by using an approximation
approach for calculating the supply decisions. We rely on the observation of variation in the key
parameters we wish to vary in the counterfactual analysis, and combine policy function estimation
30

In Appendix B we illustrate government expenditures as a function of the benchmark for several markets, including
a market which features this behavior.

Table 14: Surplus, share, and spending under the optimal policy and alternative social welfare functions

with a first-order condition solver for prices.
We apply our framework to the Medicare Advantage program in the United States, through
which approximately one-third of U.S. seniors obtain Medicare benefits, and estimate our model
using micro-level panel data. We find that the optimal subsidies differ substantially from those
currently employed by the government. The current policy generates an average of $148.65 in
consumer surplus per person per year. By maximizing the mean consumer surplus, we find an
alternative policy that results in an average of $192.65 in benefits per person per year. These
gains come largely from finding places where it is relatively easy (in the sense of needing fewer
government dollars) to move people from TM to MA rather than improving benefits for people
already on an MA plan. We show that freely-available market-level observables can be used to
approximate the optimal policy rule with a linear rule that reduces consumer surplus by 4.4% and
increases government expenditures 0.5% relative to the optimal policy.
Our framework can be adopted to any market in which subsidized firms offer differentiated
products. For example, many charter schools offer specialized curricula which may appeal to
different sets of parents. With data on family characteristics and choices, the benefits created by
these schools and the outcomes of alternative voucher-style policies could be calculated.

Monte Carlo Analysis of Supply Approximations

Our approach approximates the responses of firms to changes in the benchmark instead of solving
for the full equilibrium response – in particular, we approximate the change in plan characteristics
and then solve for the equilibrium in prices. An obvious question is how well do such approximations
work in practice. In this appendix, we run several Monte Carlo experiments to examine this issue.
In these experiments, we simulate market-level data for two periods. We use the results in the
first period as the basis for making predictions of the second period market outcomes. We explicitly
solve the firm’s problem in the second period, and compare the exact solution to an approximation
created using the first period data and the approach we employ in the paper. For simplicity, we
specify utility as uijmt = δjmt − αp2jmt + eijmt where eij is an iid Type I Extreme Value error term.
We allow price to affect utility in a nonlinear way as it allows for greater concavity in the plans
objective function – alternatively we could have allowed for convexity in the cost specification. Plan
costs are given by cjmt = exp(.2 + .2δj + νj ) where νj is drawn from a N (0, .1). In each period,
we simulate M markets where M is 50, 100 or 200. In each market, the insurers receive a subsidy,
zmt . In the first period, the market-level subsidy is sequentially ordered and ranges from .1 to 1.1
with an interval of .1. In the second period we reverse the order of the subsidies so that the highest
subsidy market is now the lowest and vice versa. In the simulations we allow the number of market
participants to range from 3 to 7.
In order to forecast the equilibrium with new benchmarks, we follow a procedure that mimics
our empirical approach. Specifically, we use the first period equilibrium results to estimate demand and given those results, invert the premium setting first-order condition to recover implied
marginal cost, m̂cjmt . We then regress the implied δjm1 on m̂cjmt and its square to recover the cost
function parameters. Importantly, we estimate the relationship between the implied δjm1 and the
benchmarks zm1 and use the results from this regression to forecast δjm1 given the updated subsidies, zm2 . We then calculate the new expected marginal cost and then solve for the new premiums
given the subsidies, the updated δjm2 and cjm2 . We compare these results to the actual impact of
changing the benchmarks where the actual impact is calculated by explicitly solving for premiums
and δjm2 using the plans’ first-order conditions for both premiums and δjm2 given the parameters
of the model.

Notes: This table presents the results of a Monte Carlo exercise which compares our equilibrium approximation
approach to actual equilibrium solutions for a simple model in which firms choose a single price and a single product
characteristic.

We define the logarithm error as ErrCS = Log(CSExact ) − Log(CSapprox ). Table A.1 presents
some of the key statistics from our Monte Carlo experiments. The results displayed in the table
indicate that our approximation approach generates estimates of consumer surplus, our key outcome
that we need to match, that are very close to an approach using an exact solution. Figure A.1
illustrates this for a run with 7 firms and 200 markets. Red circles indicate the consumer surplus
calculated when the firms’ problem is solved explicitly, and the blue circles indicate the consumer
surplus found using our approximation approach. The Figure shows our approach works well across
the range of subsidies, and works particularly well near the middle of the subsidy range.

B

The non-local behavior of surplus and expenditures

The results in Section 8.2 show that the local behavior of the surplus and expenditure functions at
the 2015 policy, in the form of the derivatives of these functions with respect to the benchmark,
point to the direction of the optimal policy. However, the derivatives alone do not provide sufficient
information to calculate the optimal policy. Though the policy function approximations we use are
linear, the pricing and share functions are not – indeed, the logit share function has both concave

48

and convex portions – and so we should expect the CS and GovExp functions to be non-linear as
well. In this Appendix, we explore the non-local behavior of the surplus and expenditure functions
through illustrated examples.
Figure B.1 illustrates components of the CSm function for Travis County, TX (containing
Austin), Cook County, IL (containing Chicago), and Worth County, GA (a rural county near
Albany). We chose these counties due to their different sizes and the typical nature of their
counterfactual equilibria. The first graph illustrates the share-weighted δj0 as a function of the
benchmark. All three counties show increases as the benchmark increases. However, Cook County,
in which 26 plans are offered, shows a larger increase than Travis County, which has 13 plans, or
Worth County, which has 3 plans. The second graph depicts the share-weighted average OOPC
for the 65-69 Good category and shows non-monotonicity as the benchmark increases, illustrating
the relative weight of the out-of-pocket costs in the utility function. The third graph shows the
share-weighted average price. The price increases slightly in Cook County for some benchmark
increases due to substitution. As the benchmark increases, prices hit the zero lower bound.
Figure B.2 illustrates components of GovExpm for the same counties. The left-hand graph
depicts the total inside share of MA. Cook County, which experiences the largest increase in average
plan δ and also has the most plans available, sees the highest increases. The right-hand graph shows
the share-weighted average bid. Cook County’s bids increase nearly 1-for-1 with an increase in the
benchmark, whereas the average bid in Travis County increases with a shallower slope, and Worth
County’s bids remain almost flat despite increasing benchmarks.
Figure B.3 combines these components into the CSm and GovExpm functions. The first graph
shows per-capita consumer surplus. Under the current policy, the three counties receive similar
surplus. As the benchmark in each county is increased, the average surplus in Cook County grows
faster than the others, eventually overtaking them after an increase of $1,000. In the prior section,
we found that the pricing mechanism was the biggest contributor to gains near the 2015 policy.
This graph illustrates that this remains true even at some distance from the 2015 policy; though
increases in CS still occur after all plans are offered with zero price, the slope is closer to zero. The
second graph illustrates per-capita government expenditures. This graph illustrates the potential
gains noted in the previous section: Cook and Travis Counties have a flat or even decreasing level
of government expenditures for modest increases in the benchmark rate. These graphs suggest that
significant gains are possible in some markets simply by incentivizing switches from TM to MA.
The second graph also illustrates the effect of the MA payment system (Equation 2), which

Notes: These graphs illustrate three outputs from our counterfactual simulations: the price-adjusted δj , OOP costs
for a 65-69 year old in Good health, and the product’s premium. These outputs are shown for Travis County, TX
(which contains Austin), Cook County, IL (which contains Chicago), and Worth County, GA (which is a rural county
near Albany). The horizontal axis is the change in the benchmark relative to the 2015 level. All outputs are averages
across plans weighted by the market share of each plan.

Notes: These graphs illustrate two outputs from our counterfactual simulation: the total share of MA (as opposed

Austin), Cook County, IL (which contains Chicago), and Worth County, GA (which is a rural county near Albany).
The horizontal axis is the change in the benchmark relative to the 2015 level.

Figure B.3: Per-capita consumer surplus and government expenditures under counterfactual benchmarks, selected counties

Notes: These graphs illustrate two outputs from our counterfactual simulation: the per-capita consumer surplus
and the per-capita government spending. The third graph illustrates the ratio of consumer surplus to government
spending. These outputs are shown for Travis County, TX (which contains Austin), Cook County, IL (which contains
Chicago), and Worth County, GA (which is a rural county near Albany). The horizontal axis is the change in the
benchmark relative to the 2015 level.

rebates a portion of the difference between the bid and the benchmark back to firms. Despite the
fact that bids in Worth County stay nearly constant, expenditures increase with the benchmark.
The final graph of Figure B.3 combines the two functions to show the average MA surplus
delivered to consumers per dollar spent by the government on the Medicare program. The slope of
this line is related to the marginal impact of spending an extra dollar in a particular county through
the MA benchmark mechanism, which is the key margin explored by the constrained maximization
algorithm of our optimal policy search. Over small increases in the benchmark, Worth County
experiences the largest gains in surplus per expenditures. However, Cook County offers the largest
possible overall gains of these counties. In other words, the optimal allocation of funds to these
counties depends in part on the level of funds available for allocation.

Notes: This table reports summary statistics for the plans in county-year markets in which we observe micro-data
through the Medicare Advantage Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). The first column reports raw means across all plancounty-year observations. Many plans are available across multiple counties, and so the second column collapses the
data to the plan-year level and weights the resulting observations by total enrollment. All prices are in 2015 dollars.
The Star rating is calculated by CMS and ranges from zero to five. We obtain 30 out-of-pocket cost estimates for
each plan, though report only three here for brevity.

Notes: An observation in this table is a plan-county-year which has a matching plan in the previous year. The
correlations reported in this table are between the change in the county-level benchmark and the change in the stated
product characteristic. Some observations are excluded due to changes in the MCBS coverage at the county level
from year-to-year.

Notes: This table presents state-level summaries of the total consumer surplus and government expenditures at the
2015 policy and our calculated optimal policy. The MCBS uses a sample of counties and weights observations to be
nationally representative; the first column reports the number of counties included in the MCBS in each state, and the
second column reports the total MCBS sample weight in the state. Consumer surplus is calculated via Equation 8.
Government expenditures include expenditures on TM and MA and are calculated via Equation 16. All surplus and
expenditure numbers reported here are calculated using MCBS sample weights.

Notes: This table compares firm shares and total variable profits under the 2015 policy to each of the alternative
policies described in Sections 8.2 and 8.3. Variable profits are computed via Equation 10 using equilibrium prices
and estimated marginal costs adjusted for changes in product characteristics under alternative policies. The entries
for BlueCross BlueShield include all members of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. All statistics are weighted
by the MCBS sample weights.

Notes: This table examines the accuracy of the equilibrium approximation approach described in Section 7.1. For
each plan, we calculate the percentage change in the variable profit earned by the firm that offers the plan in response
to an increase of 1% in all of the expected out-of-pocket costs or the δ 0 as defined in Equation 17. We update marginal
costs per the discussion in Section 7.1 and hold prices and all other product characteristics fixed for all plans in the
market. To isolate the effect of our approximation approach, we calculate this difference both at the optimal policy
and at the 2015 policy, and subtract the two.

Notes: This table decomposes the change in consumer surplus from the 2015 policy to the optimal policy by isolating
the effect of changes in product characteristics. The first column reports data for the 2015 policy and the second
column reports the results of maximizing consumer surplus per Equation 13. The third column calculates consumer
surplus using the prices under the optimal policy, but with the product characteristics from the 2015 data. The fourth
column calculates the contribution of the product characteristics to the overall change in consumer surplus from the
2015 policy to the optimal policy. Consumer surplus is calculated via Equation 8; surplus figures are in dollars per
Medicare-beneficiary-year. White, Black, and Hispanic groups are defined by CMS. All statistics are weighted by the
MCBS sample weights.
