Optimal Time-Consistent Monetary, Fiscal and Debt Maturity Policy

NBER Working Paper No. 25658
March 2019
JEL No. E62,E63
ABSTRACT
The textbook optimal policy response to an increase in government debt is simple‚Äîmonetary
policy should actively target inflation, and fiscal policy should smooth taxes while ensuring debt
sustainability. Such policy prescriptions presuppose an ability to commit. Without that ability,
the temptation to use inflation surprises to offset monopoly and tax distortions, as well as to
reduce the real value of government debt, creates a state-dependent inflationary bias problem.
High debt levels and short-term debt exacerbate the inflation bias. But this produces a debt
stabilization bias because the policy maker wishes to deviate from the tax smoothing policies
typically pursued under commitment, by returning government debt to steady-state. As a result,
the response to shocks in New Keynesian models can be radically different, particularly when
government debt levels are high.

1 Introduction
Conventional monetary-scal policy analysis assigns monetary policy the task of controlling
demand and ination and scal policy the job of ensuring scal sustainability. Optimal policy
analyses support this policy assignment. In sticky price New Keynesian models with oneperiod government debt, Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2004b) show that even a mild degree of
price stickiness implies negligible use of ination surprises to stabilize debt and near random
walk behavior in government debt and tax rates when policy makers can commit to timeinconsistent monetary and scal policies, in response to shocks. In other words, monetary
policy should be used to stabilize ination, not debt, while a tax smoothing scal policy
ensures scal sustainability.

1

Despite this apparent consensus on broad features of a desirable policy mix, empirical
evidence suggests that policy makers, even in recent years, often do not behave in this
way (see Bianchi and Ilut (2017) and Chen et al. (2018) for the United States). And the
ability of policy makers to commit, which is implicit in the consensus policy assignment,
is also doubtful. This paper studies jointly optimal monetary and scal policy when policy
makers cannot commit. We augment a standard New Keynesian model with optimally chosen
distortionary taxation and government spending, as well as government debt issued with a
realistic maturity structure. The policy maker may operate with a mild degree of myopia.
Myopia serves as a proxy for the political frictions in policy making that lead the policy
maker to give more weight to the short-run costs of scal consolidation than to the longerterm gains of lower debt.

Although Sims (2013) questions the robustness of this result when government can issue long-term
nominal bonds since this implies variations in bond prices can be used as a device to stabilize debt, Leeper
and Leith (2017) nd that, as part of a Ramsey problem, the consensus policy assignment remains largely
optimal.

equilibrium produces a plausible steady-state and, by allowing for switches in the degree of
policy maker myopia, captures the major trends in the American debt-to-GDP ratio that
Figure 1 depicts.
Four key ndings emerge:
1. A trade-o between the costs of ination and the desire to generate surprise ination drives the equilibrium. That trade-o varies with the level and the maturity of
government debt.

The policy maker faces a temptation to use ination surprises to

oset ineciencies that arise from monopolistic competition and distortionary taxation. There is an additional temptation to use ination surprises to inuence the real
value of outstanding government debta temptation that grows with the level of debt
and shrinks with the average maturity of that debt.

This state-dependent ination

bias induces the policy maker to return debt to steady state, which the Ramsey policy
maker would not do, to create a costly debt-stabilization bias.
2. Changes in how myopically the policy maker behaves allow the model to capture key
scal trends in the gure. The post-war reduction in debt-to-GDP stems from higher
taxes and an increase in ination that the debt-dependent inationary bias creates.
Conversely, increases in debtas in the 1980sarise from signicant tax cuts and a
sharp reduction in ination when a relatively myopic policy maker discounts the implications of rising debt levels. This is a new interpretation of the Volcker disination.
In the long run, though, the patient policy maker who achieves a lower debt-to-GDP
ratio will enjoy lower tax rates and ination than a myopic policy maker who chooses
to sustain a higher debt-to-GDP ratio.
3. The state-dependent ination bias implies that the optimal time-consistent policy response to shocks depends on debt levels.

A relatively myopic policy maker sustains

higher debt and ination in the long-run. In such a state, the policy maker's response
to cost-push shocks largely reects a desire to mitigate the scal repercussions of the
shock. Mark-up shocks are more inationary in a New Keynesian model augmented
with scal policy and government debt.
4. Unlike the case of commitment, allowing the policy maker to choose the relative proportions of short- versus long-term debt as part of the time-consistent policy problem
does not result in the policy maker constructing an extreme portfolio where a large
stock of short-term assets is funded by issuing long-term debt in order to benet from
shifts in the yield curve in the face of shocks (see Debortoli et al. (2017) and the discussion in Leeper and Leith (2017)). Instead, the policy maker issues a small amount
of short-term debt alongside long-term debt which they vary to inuence the policy
mix. For example, during a period of scal consolidation, increasing the proportion of
short-term debt leads to a relaxtion of monetary policy ceteris paribus, which supports
a slower rate of debt reduction.
These results touch upon a number of literatures, which appendix A discusses.

The

paper proceeds as follows. The benchmark model is described in section 2 and the optimal
time consistent policy problem in section 3. Section 4, describes the solution method and 5
presents the numerical results. Section 6 concludes.

budget constraint where government spending is nanced by distortionary taxation and/or

Most countries issue long-term nominal debt such that even modest changes in ination and interest rates
can have substantial impact on the market value of debt - see Hall and Sargent (2011) and Sims (2013) for
the empirical ndings on the contribution of this kind of scal nancing to the decline in the U.S. debt-GDP
ratio from 1945 to 1974.
It is important to note that real transfers are an exogenously given constant and are not considered to
be a policy instrument. Allowing transfers to be chosen optimally would enable the policy maker to levy a
lump-sum tax in order to nance a negative distortionary labor income tax and oset the distortion arising
from monopolistic competition,. This is a typical, but unrealistic, assumption in linear-quadratic analyses
of optimal scal and monetary policy in New Keynesian models.

In the special case where œÅ = 0, the bonds reduce to the familiar single period bonds typically studied
in the literature.
An alternative modeling approach would be to introduce an `aggregator' rm which converts the individual goods to a nal output which is purchased by households and the government. The model implies,
equivalently, that households and the government perform this aggregation themselves.

There is also market clearing in the bonds market where the portfolio of long-term bonds
held by households evolves according to the government's budget constraint.
That completes the description of the model. Before analyzing the optimal policy problem
the competitive equilibrium is dened as follows.

as given, that is, the household budget constraint (4), the production function Yt = Nt, and
the optimality conditions, (5), (6) and (12); (ii) the market clearing condition (13); (iii) the
government's budget constraint (9); and (iv) the no-Ponzi-game condition (7), for a given
initial level of government debt b‚àí1.

subject to the resource constraint (13), the New Keynesian Phillips curve (12), and the
government's budget constraint,(9).

The possibility that the policy maker suers from a

degree of myopia is captured by assuming they may discount the future more heavily than
households,

Œ≤e ‚â§ Œ≤.

In conducting this optimization the policy maker is constrained to act in a time-consistent
manner. In other words the policy maker cannot make time-inconsistent promises as to how
they will behave in the future in order to have a benecial impact on current policy trade-os
through expectations as they would under Ramsey policy. Instead, they take expectations
as given except to the extent that the debt stock they bequeath to the future aects timeconsistent policy choices in the future. To capture this future expectations are replaced by
the following state-dependent auxiliary functions,

and the multipliers,

that even though the policy maker optimizes with respect to all endogenous variables, they
are not acting as a social planner. Instead, they are choosing standard policy instruments in
order to inuence the decentralized equilibrium in a manner which maximizes their objective
function subject to the time-consistency constraint. The FOCs for the policy problem are
detailed below.
The discretionary equilibrium is determined by the system given by the FOCs, the conM

Further insight into the trade-os facing the policy maker can be generated considering
specic FOCs. The FOC for taxation reveals a key feature of the underlying policy problem.
In the absence of a need to satisfy the budget constraint through distortionary taxation,

Œª3t = 0, the tax instrument would be used to eliminate the costs associated with the outputŒª2t = 0 . In other words, if it were not for the need

ination trade-o implicit in the NKPC,

to raise tax revenues to satisfy the government's budget constraint, taxes could be adjusted to

7

Leeper, Leith & Liu: Optimal Time-Consistent Policy
eliminate any undesired movements in ination, including that arising from mark-up shocks.
Similarly, the FOC for ination highlights the nature of the inationary bias contained
in the model. The rst two terms of the FOC capture the standard inationary bias problem. The rst term measures the costs of raising ination, and the second term the output
benets of doing so (given inationary expectations) which are evaluated positively when
the economy operates at a suboptimally low level due to tax and monopolistic competition
distortions. However, in the presence of debt the third term in the FOC for ination captures
an additional reason for wanting to raise ination relative to expectations - the erosion of
the real value of debt. Economic agents will anticipate that higher debt increases the government's desire to introduce ination surprises, implying that inationary expectations are
increasing in the level of government debt,

Et [M1 (bt , t+1 )] > 0

until ination is suciently

high to eliminate policy surprises (in the absence of further shocks). The state dependence
of the inationary bias will be key in driving the policy maker's desire to reduce debt relative
to what we would observe under a time-inconsistent Ramsey policy - a tendency we label
the debt stabilization bias.
The remaining key FOC is for government debt which highlights the debt stabilization
bias. This bias can be understood by considering the FOC for debt, which can be simplied
as,

Equation (17) describes

the policy maker's optimal debt policy which can be decomposed into two elements. The rst
line gives the optimal trade-o between current and future distortions associated with the
need to satisfy the government's intertemporal budget constraint, that is achievable when
the government can commit. The second line, captures wedges which are introduced when
the policy maker is unable to commit, dening the debt stabilization bias.
Consider the debt policy implied by the standard trade-o between current and future
distortions, reected in the relationship between

Œª3t

and

Œª3t+1

in the rst line of this expres-

sion. This reects the tax-smoothing argument in Barro (1979), requiring that the marginal
costs of taxation are smoothed over time.
Initially assume the policy maker is not myopic, so

Œ≤e = Œ≤ .

In this case, when the return

(adjusted for any covariance with the future costs of satisfying the government's intertemporal budget constraint,

Œª3t+1 ) on holding the government bonds is equal to the household's

rate of time preference, the distortions associated with satisfying the budget constraint are
constant over time and steady-state debt will follow a random walk. Eectively, under tax
smoothing, the policy maker trades-o the short-run costs of reducing the stock of debt
against the discounted value of the long-term benets. When debt service costs are consistent with the household/government's rate of time preference, these will be exactly balanced
at a debt level which depends upon the history of the shocks hitting the economy.
Reintroducing myopia, such that

Œ≤e < Œ≤ ,

implies that when real interest rates dier from

8

Leeper, Leith & Liu: Optimal Time-Consistent Policy
the policy maker's rate of time preference, then the policy maker will choose to tilt these
distortions backwards (forwards) in time depending on whether debt service costs are below
(above) the policy maker's rate of time preference. For example, when the real rate of return

is rising over time. The myopic policy maker would allow debt to rise.

However (17) is a generalized Euler equation, which, in the second line, includes partial
derivatives of policy functions with respect to debt due to the time-consistency requirement.
In general the form of these auxiliary functions is unknown, which is why the policy problem needs to be solved numerically. However, that numerical solution robustly gives clear
signs for these derivatives,

M1 (bt , t+1 ) > 0

and

L1 (bt , t+1 ) < 0

which have an intuitive

interpretation.
The rst term on the second line of (17) reects the fact that ination expectations rise
with debt levels (through the ination biases discussed above - see the FOC for ination),

M1 (bt , t+1 ) > 0, and since this is costly in the presence of nominal inertia, there is a desire to
deviate from tax smoothing, in order to reduce debt and the associated increase in ination.
This is the rst reason for wanting to reduce debt relative to the level that would be supported
by a benevolent Ramsey planner.
The second term in square brackets in the second line captures the impact of higher
debt on bond prices. Since higher debt raises ination, which in turn reduces bond prices,

L1 (bt , t+1 )< 0,

this term also serves to encourage a reduction in debt levels, when debt is

relatively short-term. Why? High, but falling debt levels imply an upward trend in bond
prices which makes it cheaper to issue new debt, but more costly to buy-back the existing
debt stock. As debt maturity is increased, the latter eect rises relative to the former, and
hence the desire to reduce debt levels is reduced, ceteris paribus.

This trade-o between

tax-smoothing and time-consistency determines the equilibrium level of debt and ination,
where ination is expected to be closer to zero as debt maturity rises, for a given level of
debt.

4 Solution Method and Calibration
For the model described in the previous section, the equilibrium policy functions cannot
be computed in closed form and local approximation methods are not applicable, as the
model's steady state around which local dynamics should be approximated is endogenously
determined as part of the model solution and thus a priori unknown. This necessitates the
use of global solution methods. Specically, the Chebyshev collocation method with time
iteration.

The detailed algorithm is presented in appendix E. In general, optimal discre-

tionary policy problems can be characterized as a dynamic game between the private sector
and successive governments.

Multiplicity of equilibria is a common problem in dynamic

games of this kind. Since the solution algorithm uses polynomial approximations, it is, in
eect, searching only for continuous Markov-perfect equilibria where agents condition their
strategies on payo-relevant state variables, see Judd (2004) for a discussion.
Before solving the model numerically, the benchmark values of structural parameters
must be specied.

The scal variables are calibrated to ensure the benchmark model mimics the key ratios
in U.S. data over the period 1954-2008 as discussed in B and reported in the rst column of
Table 2. Parameter

ensures government consumption is 7.8% of GDP, transfers

Œ≤e = 0.982

are set to be 9% and the myopia of the policy maker is set to

(an eective time

horizon of just under 20 years) which supports an annualized steady-state debt-to-GDP
ratio of 31%. The coupon decay parameter,

œÅ = 0.95,

corresponds to around

5

years of debt

maturity, consistent with U.S. data. The implied ratio of tax revenues to GDP in steadystate is slightly higher than the data average of 17.5% reecting the fact that actual policy
has often run a decit in recent decades.
The price adjustment cost parameter,

œÜ = 50, implies, given the equivalence between the

linearized NKPCs under Rotemberg and Calvo pricing (see Leith and Liu, 2016), that on
average rms re-optimize prices every six months - in line with empirical evidence. Finally,
the cost-push shock process is parameterized as

œÅ = 0.939

and

œÉ = 0.052

in line with

estimates in Chen et al. (2017) and Smets and Wouters (2003).
With this benchmark parameterization, the model solution generates a maximum Euler
‚àí6
equation error over the full range of the grid is of the order of 10 . We plot these errors in

8

F. As suggested by Judd (1998) , this order of accuracy is reasonable.

5 Numerical Results
This section explores the properties of the equilibrium under optimal time-consistent policy.
Subsection 5.1 considers the steady-state under a series of alternative parameterizations.
Subsection 5.2 introduces switches in the degree of policy maker myopia enabling the model
to mimic observed movements in the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio. The optimal policy response
to shocks is discussed in subsection 5.3 and the debt maturity decision is endogenized in
subsection 5.4.

5.1 Steady State
Table 2 summarizes the steady state values for a variety of parameterizations, contrasting
them with the data averages contained in column 1. Beginning with the benchmark calibration but temporarily removing policy maker myopia such that

Œ≤e = Œ≤

- column 3 of Table 2.

We can see the key trade-os underpinning this steady-state equilibrium by considering the
(deterministic) steady-state value of the FOC for debt, equation (17),

(18)

In the robustness exercises conducted in appendix J the elasticity for public spending is lowered in line
with the evidence in Debortoli and Nunes (2013). However, this does not aect the key results.
All other model variants considered are equally well approximated - these results are available upon
request.

4Y
In this equilibrium the policy maker has accumulated assets, but these fall short of the war

10

chest level needed to support the rst best allocation.

There is a steady-state deation

which ensures the policy maker is not tempted to introduce any further surprise deation to
increase the value of the assets it has accumulated.
Introducing policy maker myopia can overturn this result - see the second column of
Table 2, labeled benchmark. The benchmark has been calibrated to replicate a positive

11

debt-to-GDP ratio of 31% and government consumption to output of 7.8%.

The steady-

state rate of ination this implies is 3%. The key equation dening this steady-state is the
FOC for debt given by

Œ≤e

Œ†
Œ≤

(19)

where the myopia can turn the RHS of this condition negative, thereby supporting a positive
steady-state debt-to-GDP ratio. The debt stabilization bias is reduced, as the policy maker
is less inclined to incur the costs of debt reduction in order to achieve longer-term benets.
It is notable that this change does little to aect the other key scal ratios of government
consumption and taxation relative to GDP.
Column 4 increases policy maker myopia further to

Œ≤e = 0.975,

which is equivalent to

reducing the policy maker's time horizon from 20 to 12 years. This more than doubles the
steady-state debt-to-GDP ratio to 75.6% and ination rises to 4.5%.
Increasing the exibility of prices means both that the costs of ination are lower, and
that monetary policy is less eective in aecting the real economy. As a result the government
is able to sustain a higher debt-to-GDP ratio which rises by 5.5%, as they are less driven to
reduce the state-dependent inationary bias problem. This leads to a larger steady-state rate
of ination of 3.8%, but it should be remembered that ination is now less costly. Finally,
reducing the mark-up is important since it implies the inationary bias problem is lower for
a given level of debt.

As a result the desire to inuence the state-dependent inationary

bias problem by reducing debt is less - the debt stabilization bias has been reduced. This
leads to a substantial increase in the steady-state debt-to-GDP ratio to almost 90% and an
associated increase in the steady-state rate of ination to 3.7%.
Table 3, considers the impact of changes in the maturity structure of debt. Column 1
adopts the common assumption that debt is only of a single period's duration (one quarter in
the context of the model parameterization). In this case the steady-state debt-to-GDP ratio

No parameter permutations have been found which imply œÅ > Œ† such that the model without myopia
can sustain a positive steady-state debt stock. Intuitively, unless debt stocks are negative, the economy
remains suciently distorted that the inationary bias problem ensures Œ† > œÅ.
The war chest asset stock would be 4,636% of GDP.
An alternative device, that has been used in the literature (see for example Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe
(2004b) and Niemann et al. (2013)), is to introduce a monetary friction to generate a positive steady-state
debt-to-GDP ratio. Embedding such a device in the current model (see appendix G) can achieve this aim
but not robustly. It is only when price stickiness is reduced to implausibly low levels (œÜ < 4, an eective
average price duration of less than 4 months) that the debt-to-GDP ratio turns mildly positive.

turns negative, -11% and ination is 3.5%. While, increasing debt maturity to 30 years, leads
to a signicant increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio to over 102% of GDP and ination to over
5%. This reects the discussion above - longer maturity debt reduces the debt stabilization
bias allowing the government to sustain a higher steady-state debt-to-GDP ratio.
In summary, myopia, monopolistic competition distortions and debt maturity are the key
drivers of the equilibrium rate of ination and debt-to-GDP ratio, while other endogenously
determined steady-state scal ratios are largely unaected by these changes. This highlights
the importance of the state-dependent inationary bias and the associated debt stabilization
bias in jointly determining the equilibrium outcomes for ination and debt.

5.2 Transition Dynamics
The model, despite macthing key scal data averages, cannot capture the key trends in the
debt-to-GDP ratio seen in the data.

For example, the standard deviation of the annual-

ized debt-to-GDP ratio is only 0.7% under the benchmark calibration despite the equivalent
volatility in the data being 9%. This implies that the scal consequences of mark-up shocks
are insucient to capture the movements in debt despite being calibrated in line with empirical estimates of such shock processes.

12

Therefore, in order to generate plausible movements

in the debt-to-GDP ratio, there is a need to go beyond standard economic shocks and consider political frictions.
Specically, the degree of policy maker myopia is assumed switch between two regimes,

{Œ≤eL , Œ≤eH }

where

Œ≤eL > Œ≤eH

where the former `L' regime has a low degree of myopia and corre-

spondingly supports a lower level of debt. Conversely, the high myopia regime is consistent
with a higher debt level. There is an associated
transition probability

in conict with their future selves but to discount the future in line with whatever degree
of myopia is in place at the time. As a result, the degree of myopia becomes an additional
state variable so that the value function is dened as,

subject to the same constraints as before but where all auxiliary functions are based on this
expanded state-space where

Œ≤eit = Œ≤eL

or

Œ≤eH .

The implications of this model extension for

the description of optimal policy are outlined in H.
The calibration of this Markov switching process follows Chen et al. (2018) in identifying
key shifts in the trend of the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio - see Figure 1.

Between 1954 and

the rst budget of the Reagan presidency in 1981 debt is on a downward trend. Similarly

Other shocks such as technology and transfer shocks are also unable to do so. Even allowing for temporarily unstable paths for transfers as in Bi et al. (2013) cannot generate data-consistent movements in
debt-to-GDP ratios as the policy maker aggressively raises taxes to nance the rising transfers.
12

Leeper, Leith & Liu: Optimal Time-Consistent Policy
sustained reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio. We label these episodes as being periods of
low myopia. In contrast the periods of rising debt-to-GDP ratios covering all other periods
are labeled as high myopia. Given this labeling the implied transition matrices between the
two regimes can be estimated as,

.

Œ≤eL = 0.9866

and

Œ≤eH = 0.9759

are chosen to replicate the peaks and troughs of the debt-to-GDP ratio found in the data,
while the remainder of the benchmark calibration is retained. The success of this exercise
can be seen in Figure 1 where the model implied dynamics of the debt-to-GDP ratio track
the data both in the sense of ensuring the model can achieve the highs and lows seen in the
data, but also the pace at which debt increases or decreases over time.
The rst set of experiments looks at the transitions between high and low debt regimes.
The solid line in Figure 3 plots the movements of key variables as a relative patient policy
maker seeks to reduce debt (as was the case following the end of WWII). Similarly, the
debt build-up from the 1980s onwards can be explored by examining the implications of a
relatively myopic policy maker inheriting a low level of debt. In both cases the transitional
dynamics are strikingly dierent from the ultimate steady-state (conditional on remaining
in the particular myopia regime). A relatively patient government inheriting a large debt
stock faces, for a given rate of ination, greater incentives to induce ination surprises
to reduce that debt burden.

This induces them to raise taxation sharply and to a lesser

extent reduce government consumption to facilitate the reduction in debt. At the same time
monetary policy is tightened to partially oset the increase in ination. In the longer term,
the successful reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio allows the economy to sustain lower taxes,
higher government consumption and lower ination.
The converse is true when a relatively myopic government inherits a low debt stock.
Since they care less about the future costs of servicing debt, their incentives to reduce a
given level of debt through surprise ination are lower. This enables them to dramatically
reduce taxes and, to a lesser extent, increase government consumption in the short-run,
while simultaneously enjoying relatively low ination.

Indeed it is only when the myopic

government has raised the debt-to-GDP ratio by around 15% relative to the patient policy
maker that the paths of ination cross. However, ultimately the myopic policy maker suers
from higher taxation, lower government consumption and higher ination as a result of the
debt they accumulate in the long-run.
A key element in this is the maturity of the debt stock. Table 3 shows that increasing
debt maturity from the common assumption of single period debt to the ultra long maturity
of 30 years raises the steady-state debt-to-GDP ratio from -11% to 102%. It also impacts
the transitional dynamics. In Figure 3 the initial debt stock is xed to be common across all
experiments at 58% of GDP and the Figure then describes the transition to the steady-state.
The shorter the maturity structure of the debt, the more rapidly the policy maker undertakes
their scal consolidation. Consistent with the analysis above, the inationary bias problem
is notably worse as debt maturity shortens implying much higher rates of ination for an
identical state of the economy.

This in turn encourages the policy maker to reduce debt

levels more rapidly and to a lower steady-state level when debt maturity is shorter i.e. the
debt stabilization bias is greater for a shorter maturity debt stock.

13

Leeper, Leith & Liu: Optimal Time-Consistent Policy
5.3 Responding to Shocks
In the context of a model which mimics the major movements in the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio,
this subsection considers how debt levels aect the optimal policy response to shocks. In the
standard New Keynesian economy the only shocks generating meaningful policy trade-os
for the policy maker are cost-push/mark-up shocks.

If we remove all the scal elements
Œµt
by 0.5%
Œµt ‚àí1
then the optimal monetary policy response is to tighten policy to reduce ination until the
of our model and apply a mark-up shock which raises the desired mark-up

output costs of further monetary tightening are too great. The paths for output, ination
and interest rate under such a policy are given by the green dotted lines in the bottom three
sub-panels of Figure 4.
Adding distortionary taxation to such a model potentially introduces a very eective
policy instrument for dealing with such shocks. Temporarily ignoring the implications for
government debt of such a policy, the tax rate entering the NKPC could be varied to oset
the impact of the variations in

Œµt .

Figure 4 shows the reduction in taxation which would

achieve this negation of the inationary and output consequences of a positive mark-up
shock and leave the economy at its steady-state - see the dotted magenta line in the tax rate
sub-panel of Figure 4.
Turning now to the benchmark model, such a scal response to shocks is tempered by
the fact that the policy maker must also ensure scal solvency and does not have access to
lump-sum taxes with which to do so. Figure 4 plots the optimal time-consistent response
to a mark-up shock conditional on being in the high (solid blue lines) or low (dashed red
lines) debt regime. The existence of debt amplies the impact of the shock, especially when
we are in the high debt regime.

Moreover, although tax cuts could in theory oset the

inationary consequences of the mark-up shock (the dotted magenta line in Figure 4) this
would exacerbate the increase in debt which drives the inationary bias problem discussed
above.

As a result the policy maker

raises

tax rates to ensure that debt falls as a more

eective way of mitigating the inationary consequences of the mark-up shock. Nevertheless
the higher tax rates do increase ination and monetary policy is tightened to help oset
that. The end result is that the response to the mark-up shock is overwhelmingly driven by
the desire to reduce debt through tax increases and thereby mitigate the state-dependent
inationary bias problem. Government spending largely moves in line with output such that
there is negligible variation in the ratio of

G/Y -

government consumption is hardly used as

13

an instrument of either macroeconomic or scal stabilization.

5.4 Debt Management and the Debt Stabilization Bias
Up until this point, the level of debt maturity has been held xed by parameterizing

œÅ.

This

subsection allows for the policy maker to have some control over the maturity structure as
part of the time-consistent optimal policy problem, by allowing them to issue a mixture

If the intertemporal elasticity of substitution for government consumption is reduced to œÉg = 1 in line
with the evidence summarized in Debortoli and Nunes (2013), the standard deviation of the G/Y ratio rises
from 0.8% to 1.4%, which is closer to the data average of 1.9%. However, this does not have a signicant
impact on either the transition between high/low debt regimes or the response to shocks other than to
marginally enhance the role played by government consumption. See Appendix J.
13

14

Leeper, Leith & Liu: Optimal Time-Consistent Policy
of shorter and longer-maturity debt, possibly of opposite signs (i.e. one can be held as an
asset and the other a liability). The reason why this is conjectured to be an interesting debt
management policy is that the results obtained so far suggest that high debt levels imply
a large state-dependent inationary bias, which can turn to a deationary bias when the
government holds assets even although the economy is still operating at a less than ecient
level. These biases are more acute, ceteris paribus, when the bond is short term. Therefore,
issuing a short-term asset may oset the inationary bias associated with a large stock of
long-term debt.
To explore this possibility the supply of single-period bonds is no longer assumed to be

zero. The wealth of the existing bondholders entering period t is now Dt ‚â° (1 + œÅPt )Bt‚àí1 +

The remainder of the policy problem is unchanged, except for the fact that policy functions
now have three arguments, the elasticity of substitution between goods, t , and the levels of
S
both maturities of bond, bt‚àí1 and bt‚àí1 . Appendix I derives the resultant FOCs.
By varying the relative proportions of these two types of bonds, the policy maker can
inuence the average maturity of the outstanding stock of debt and the associated ination
bias. Figure 5 plots the transition dynamics for the benchmark calibration, with and without
the government possessing the ability to issue short-term bonds in addition to long-term debt.
Despite the high overall debt-to-GDP ratio, the quantity of short-term debt issued is very
low. Under optimal but time-consistent policy, the policy maker does not issue long-term
debt to purchase short-term assets.

14

Instead, there is an extremely modest issuance of

short-term debt, even when overall debt levels are very high. The short-term debt serves to
support changes in the time-consistent policy mix. Specically, monetary policy is relaxed
relative to the case where no short-term debt is issued. This lower real interest rate slows
the speed of scal consolidation allowing taxation to be lower in the short-run.

6 Conclusions
The existence of nominal debt induces a state-dependent ination bias problem as the policy
maker wishes to utilize ination surprises to oset monopolistic competition and tax distortions and reduce the real value of debt. This temptation is greater with higher debt levels
and shorter debt maturity, resulting in a debt stabilization bias as the policy maker deviates
from Ramsey policy by returning debt to steady state to mitigate the associated ination
biases.
Allowing for switches in a modest degree of policy maker myopia allows the model to
replicate the key trends in the post-WWII debt-to-GDP ratio in the United States.

The

response to shocks in such an environment seeks to avoid exacerbating these biases, while
endogenizing the debt maturity decision reduces the speed of scal correction.

Such portfolios have been used as a hedging device when policy makers can commit (see Debortoli et al.
(2017) and Leeper and Leith (2017)).

Related Literature

The current paper is related to several strands of the optimal monetary and scal policy
literature and the following discussion highlights those that are most closely related in terms
of topics and numerical methods.
The contribution of the paper is most closely related to the literature that studies optimal
scal and monetary policy in sticky price New Keynesian models using non-linear solution
techniques. Following the work of Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2004b) and Siu (2004), Faraglia
et al. (2013) solve a Ramsey problem using a parameterized expectation algorithm (PEA)
to examine the implications for optimal ination of changes in the level and maturity of
government debt. Similarly, Leeper and Zhou (2013) consider a model similar to the current
one, nding that ination surprises are a small but signicant part of the optimal policy
response to shocks. We study the discretionary equivalent of this policy, which is radically
dierent in terms of equilibrium outcomes. Niemann and Pichler (2011) globally solve for
optimal scal and monetary policies under both commitment and discretion in an economy
featuring a cash-in-advance constraint which alters the inationary bias problem relative to

15

that obtained in our more standard cashless New Keynesian model.

Additionally, they do

not consider debt levels as large as recently observed in a number of advanced economies.
Niemann et al. (2013) study time-consistent policy in the model of Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe
(2004b) and identify a simple mechanism that generates ination persistence. Government
spending is exogenous in the latter two papers which also do not consider long-term debt.
Similarly, abstracting from long-term debt, Matveev (2014) compares the ecacy of discretionary government spending and labor income taxes for the purpose of scal stimulus at the
liquidity trap. In contrast the analysis presented here considers large deviations of debt from
steady-state and debt of dierent maturities (both features which can radically aect the
optimal policy response to shocks), time-consistent optimal policy making, and endogenous
determination of the maturity structure and government consumption as part of the policy
problem.
Aside from the relatively small literature exploring optimal monetary and scal policy
in non-linear New Keynesian models, there is a vast literature on Ramsey scal and monetary policy in the tradition of Lucas and Stokey (1983), which tends to focus on real or
exible-price economies. In exible-price environments, the government's problem consists
in nancing an exogenous stream of public spending by choosing the least disruptive combination of ination and distortionary income taxes.

In an incomplete-markets version of

Lucas and Stokey (1983), Aiyagari et al. (2002) simulate the model globally and show that
the level of welfare in Ramsey economies with and without real state-contingent debt is virtually the same. In addition, they rearm the random-walk results of debt and taxes from
Barro (1979).

Angeletos et al. (2013) introduce collateral constraints and a liquidity role

for government bonds into Aiyagari et al. (2002).

They use the Value Function Iteration

(VFI) method to globally solve the modied model and nd that the steady-state level of

Monetary frictions are sometimes introduced as a means of ensuring a positive steady-state debt to GDP
ratio. This modeling device is discussed in Appendix G.
15

22

Leeper, Leith & Liu: Optimal Time-Consistent Policy
debt is no longer indeterminate, when government bonds can serve as collateral. Cao (2014)
extends Angeletos et al. (2013) with long-term debt and studies how the cost of ination for
commercial banks aects the design of scal and monetary policy. Likewise, Faraglia et al.
(2014) use PEA methods to solve a Ramsey problem with incomplete markets and long-term
bonds. They show that many features of optimal policy are sensitive to the introduction of
long-term bonds, in particular tax variability and the long run behavior of debt. The current ndings convey the same message that maturity lengths like those observed in actual
economies can substantially alter the nature of optimal policies, but the policy problem in a
sticky price economy where the policy maker is unable to commit is fundamentally dierent.
There is also a literature on optimal scal and monetary policy in monetary models, which
do not contain nominal inertia, but may contain a cost to ination. Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe
(2004a) study Ramsey policy in a exible-price model with cash-in-advance constraint, which
essentially extends the model of Lucas and Stokey (1983) to an imperfectly competitive
environment.

A global numerical method is used to characterize the dynamic properties

of the Ramsey allocation.

In a cash-in-advance model, Martin (2009) studies the time

consistency problems that arise from the interaction between debt and monetary policy,
since ination reduces the real value of nominal liabilities. He uses projection methods to
deal with the generalized Euler equations, see also Martin (2011), Martin (2013) and Martin
(2014) where time consistent policies are studied in variants of the monetary search model
of Lagos and Wright (2005). Monetary frictions are considered in Section G, but most of
the analysis abstracts from such frictions and emphasizes nominal price stickiness as the
conventional approach to generating sizable real eects from monetary policy.
Moving away from models which jointly model monetary and scal policy, there is also
a literature on optimal time-consistent scal policy in real models. This literature typically
focuses on Markov-perfect policy, where households' and the government's policy rules are
functions of payo-relevant variables only.

Local approximations around a non-stochastic

steady state are typically infeasible for these models, since optimal behavior is characterized
by generalized Euler equations that involve the derivatives of some equilibrium decision rules,
and thus it is impossible to compute the steady state independent of these rules.
global solution methods are required.

Hence

Klein and Rios-Rull (2003) compare the stochastic

properties of optimal scal policy without commitment with those properties under a fullcommitment policy in a neoclassical growth model with a balanced government budget, see
also Krusell et al. (2006) and Klein et al. (2008). Ortigueira (2006) studies Markov-perfect
optimal taxation under a balanced-budget rule, while Ortigueira et al. (2012) deal with the
case of unbalanced budgets. In a version of Lucas and Stokey (1983) model with endogenous
government expenditure, Debortoli and Nunes (2013) nd that when governments cannot
commit, debt is no longer indeterminate and often converges to a steady-state with no debt
accumulation at all. This is a quite striking dierence in the behavior of debt between the
full commitment and the no-commitment cases. Similarly, Grechyna (2013) also considers
endogenous government spending in the environment of Lucas and Stokey (1983) with only
one-period debt and shows that around the steady state, the properties of the scal variables
are very similar, regardless of commitment assumptions.

More recently, Debortoli et al.

(2017) consider a Lucas and Stokey (1983) economy without state-contingent bonds and
commitment, and show that the government actively manages its debt positions and can
approximate optimal policy by conning its debt instruments to consols. Solving the policy

23

Leeper, Leith & Liu: Optimal Time-Consistent Policy
problem set out below shares the same technical problem due to the presence of generalized
Euler equations, but nominal rigidities make the model setup quite dierent from these
papers.
Finally, the new political economy literature (see Alesina and Passalacqua (2017) for
a comprehensive survey) considers how various aspects of the political process aect the
accumulation of government debt, and the tendency of some economies to be prone to a decit
bias. While there are numerous mechanisms through which political economy considerations
inuence scal policy, including the use of debt as a strategic variable, wars of attrition over
who bears the burden of scal reforms and the nature of the budgetary process itself, in
essence these political frictions imply that policy makers may not fully internalize the longterm benets of lower debt, while remaining acutely aware of the short-term costs of any
scal correction. This implicit myopia is captured informally, by considering the implications
of the policy maker discounting the future at a rate which is higher than that of society as
a whole.

B Data
We follow Chen et al. (2018) and Bianchi and Ilut (2017) in constructing our scal variables.
The data for government spending, tax revenues and transfers, are taken from National
Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) Table 3.2 (Federal Government Current Receipts and
Expenditures) released by the Bureau of Economics Analysis. These data series are nominal
and in levels.

Government Spending.

Government spending is dened as the sum of consumption

expenditure (line 21), gross government investment (line 42), net purchases of nonproduced
assets (line 44), minus consumption of xed capital (line 45), minus wage accruals less
disbursements (line 33).

Total tax revenues.

Total tax revenues are constructed as the dierence between

current receipts (line 38) and current transfer receipts (line 16).

Transfers.

Transfers is dened as current transfer payments (line 22) minus current

transfer receipts (line 16) plus capital transfers payments (line 43) minus capital transfer
receipts (line 39) plus subsidies (line 32).

Federal government debt.

Federal government debt is the market value of privately

held gross Federal debt, which is downloaded from Dallas Fed web-site

The above three scal variables are normalized with respect to Nominal GDP. Nominal
GDP is taken from NIPA Table 1.1.5 (Gross Domestic Product).
Real GDP. Real GDP is take download from NIPA Table 1.1.6 (Real Gross Domestic
Product, Chained Dollars)

The GDP deator.

The GDP deator is obtained from NIPA Table 1.1.5 (Gross

Domestic Product).

Eective Federal Funds Rate.

Eective Federal Funds Rate is taken from the St.

Louis Fed website.
The implied ratios are presented in the rst column of Table 2.

D First-Best Allocation
In some analyses of optimal scal policy (e.g., Aiyagari et al., 2002), it is desirable for the
policy maker to accumulate a `war chest' which pays for government consumption and/or
scal subsidies to correct for other market imperfections. In order to assess to what extent
our optimal, but time-consistent policy attempts to do so, it is helpful to dene the level
of government accumulated assets that would be necessary to mimic the social planner's
allocation under the decentralized solution. The rst step in doing so is dening the rstbest allocation that would be implemented by the social planner. The social planner ignores
the nominal inertia and all other ineciencies, and chooses real allocations that maximize
the representative consumer's utility, subject to the aggregate resource constraint and the
‚àó
‚àó
‚àó
aggregate production function. That is, the rst-best allocation {Ct , Nt , Gt } is the one that
maximizes utility (26), subject to the technology constraint (25), and aggregate resource
constraint

Yt = Ct + Gt .

The rst order conditions imply that

(Ct‚àó )‚àíœÉ = œá (G‚àót )‚àíœÉg = (Nt ‚àó )œï = (Yt ‚àó )œï
That is, given the resource constraints, it is optimal to equate the marginal utility of private
and public consumption to the marginal disutility of labor eort and the optimal share of
government consumption in output is

(28)

It is illuminating to contrast the allocation achieved in the steady state of the decentralized equilibrium with this rst best allocation. We do this by nding policies and prices
that make the rst-best allocation and the decentralized equilibrium coincide. Appendix C
shows that the steady-state level of output in the decentralized economy is given by,

Comparing (29) and (28), and assuming the steady state share of government consumption
is the same, then the two allocations will be identical when the labor income tax rate is set
optimally to be,

Leeper, Leith & Liu: Optimal Time-Consistent Policy
Notice that the optimal tax rate is negative, that is, it is eectively a subsidy which osets
the monopolistic competition distortion.

This, in turn, requires that the government has

accumulated a stock of assets dened as,

Using our benchmark calibration below, this would imply that a stock of assets of

4636%

of GDP would be required to generate sucient income to pay for government expenditure
(consumption and scal transfers) and a labor income subsidy which completely osets the
eects of the monopolistic competition distortion. In the absence of policy maker myopia,
the steady-state level of debt in our optimal policy problem while negative, falls far short of
this `war chest' value.
It is also interesting to note the implied optimal share of government spending in GDP
that would be chosen by the social planner is 7.7% which is very close to that chosen by the
policy maker in our decentralized (7.82%) distorted economy implying that G is 3.9% lower
than the rst best while GDP is 5.4% smaller than it would be under the social planner's
allocation.

G Model with Money
In this Section we introduce a monetary friction which has been used as a device to achieve
a positive steady-state debt-to-GDP ratio in models similar to the model analyzed in our
paper.

G.1 Households' Problem
The budget constraint at time

is given by

Pt (j)Ct (j)dj(1 + s(vt )) + PtM BtM + Mt ‚â§ Œût + (1 + œÅPtM )Bt‚àí1
+ Mt‚àí1 + Wt Nt (1 ‚àí œÑt )

0

Pt (j) is the price of variety j , Œû is the representative household's share of prots in the
imperfectly competitive rms, W are wages, and œÑ is an wage income tax rate. Money, Mt ,
where

facilitates consumption purchases since consumption purchases are subject to a proportional
transaction cost

s(vt ),

which depends on consumption-based money velocity,

Pt (j)Ct (j)dj

The transaction cost function satises the same assumptions as in Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe
(2004b).

Specically,

s(v)

s(v)

satises:(i)

is non-negative and twice continuously dierv , such that s(v) = s0 (v) = 0; (iii)

entiable; (ii)there is a satiation level of velocity,
0
(v ‚àí v)s0 (v) > 0 for v 6= v ; and (iv)2s0 (v) + vs0 (v) >

0 for all v ‚â• v .

Note, however, following

Niemann et al. (2013), that we have changed the timing assumption of Schmitt-Grohe and
Uribe (2004b) to make this more akin to a cash in advance constraint. This ensures that
unanticipated ination is costly in the absence of sticky prices, just as anticipated ination
is.
As a result of introducing this transactions cost, the households' rst order conditions
become,

Goods market clearing requires, for each good

j,

Yt (j) = Ct (j)(1 + s(vt )) + Gt (j) + Œ∑t (j)

The discretionary equilibrium is determined by the system given by the FOCs, (39),
M
=
- (47), the constraints in (35) , the auxiliary equations, (36)-(38), bond prices, Pt
œÉ
Œ≤Ct Et [L(bt , t+1 )], and the exogenous process for the markup shock,

ln(t ) = (1 ‚àí œÅ ) ln() + œÅ ln(t‚àí1 ) + œÉ Œµt , Œµt ‚àº N (0, 1)
The solution to this system is a set of time-invariant Markov-perfect equilibrium policy rules

yt = H(st‚àí1 ) mapping the vector of states st‚àí1 = {bt‚àí1 , mt‚àí1 , t } to the optimal decisions for
yt = {Ct , Gt , Yt , Œ†t , œÑt , bt , mt , PtM , Œª1t , Œª2t , Œª3t , Œª4t , Œª5t , Œª6t } for all t ‚â• 0.
Solving this model can generate a positive steady-state debt-to-GDP ratio. However, it
is only when price stickiness is reduced to implausibly low levels (œÜ

< 4,

an eective average

price duration of less than 4 months) that the debt-to-GDP ratio can be turned mildly
positive. For example with

œÜ = 2.5

(equivalent to a Calvo probability of no price change of

0.14 and an average price duration of just under 3.5 months), the steady-state debt-to-GDP
ratio is 13.3%, but this implies very large ination response to shocks alongside negligible
movements in the debt-to-GDP ratio. This suggests that the mild myopia adopted in this
paper is a more data-consistent motivation for existence of a positive steady-state debt
and the observed uctuations in debt relative to that steady-state, which also facilitates a
comparison with the commonly used cashless economy framework of much New Keynesian
analysis of optimal policy.

H Switches in Policy Maker Myopia

equilibrium policy rules
optimal decisions for

the policy problem in this way the policy maker does not try to tie the hands of their future
selves. They simply accept that there are periods in which they will be relatively more or
less patient. To allow for conict between two policy makers of dierent degrees of myopia, it
would be necessary for each policy maker to evaluate the anticipated policy outcomes when
their opponent was in power using their own discount factor and adjust policies in inuence
their opponent's behavior. It would be interesting to consider these strategic interactions in
future work.

J Lower Intertemporal Elasticity of Substitution for Government Consumption

for government consumption in utility to

œÉg = 1 .

This increases the use of government

consumption as a scal policy instrument, but without changing any of the conclusions of
the main paper. See Figure 8 below.

Figure 8: Impulse Response to Mark-Up Shock under High/Low Debt Regimes: Robustness
Check. Government consumption and output measured as percentage deviation from steadystate. All other variations as deviation from steady-state. New Keynesian model without
scal policy - green dotted line.

Hypothetical tax rate which would oset shock - dotted

magenta line. Monetary and scal response under high myopia/debt regime - blue solid line.
Monetary and scal response under low myopia/debt regime - red dot-dash line.
