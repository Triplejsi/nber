Self-Selection

ABSTRACT

Self-selection plays

a dominant role in determining the size and

composition of immigrant flows.

The United States competes with other

potential host countries in the "immigration market".

Host countries vary

in their "offers" of economic opportunities and also differ in the way they
ration entry through their immigration policies.

Potential immigrants

compare the various opportunities and are non-randomly sorted by the
immigration market among the various host countries.

This paper presents a

theoretical and empirical analysis of this marketplace. The theory of
immigration presented in this paper describes the way in which immigrants
are sorted among host countries in terms of both their observed and
unobserved characteristics. The empirical analysis uses Census data from
Australia, Canada, and the United States and shows that U.S.
"competitiveness" in the immigration market has declined significantly in
the postwar period.

remain sufficiently large to encourage the flow of millions of

persons across national boundaries.

United Nations statistics, for example,

report that in the 1975—1980 period, nearly 5 million persons migrated to a
different country, with nearly two thirds of these individuals migrating to
one of three countries, the United States, Canada, and Australia.1 There
exists, therefore,

a large reservoir of persons who believe that better

experience those opportunities.

These two conditions

imply that the pool of

migrants will not be randomly chosen from the population of the countries of
the potential
origin, and that it will not be randomly distributed across
countries of destination.

Instead the pool of immigrants in any host

country will be composed of the subsample of persons who face better opportunities in that particular host country than either in the country of

1y recant work in this area (Borjas, 1985, 1987) has addressed two
related questions raised by the early studies.

Since most of the literature

that analyzes immigrant earnings focuses on the study of single cross—section

data sets, my 1985 paper raiosd the possibility that the 'overtaking"
findings could be due to the fact that cross-section

regressions confound

aging and cohort effects.3 The positive correlation between immigrant
earnings and years of residence in the U.S. observed in the cross—section
could arise because immigrants "adapt" rapidly to the U.S. labor market, or
because earlier waves of immigrants differ in substantial ways (labor market
productivities,

unobserved abilities or skills) from the more recent waves.

Eorjas (1985) adapted well-known techniques

(see, for example,

Heckman, 1983)

to separately identify aging and cohort effects using the 1970 and 1980 U.S.

This raises the important question of exactly which factors

determine whether immigrants are positively or negatively selected from the

Borjas (1987) presents an initial

attempt to address this problem and derives a simple economic model of

law

In fact, under a

reasonable set of conditions it is likely that inunigrants are negatively
selected (i.e., persons who have below average earnings and productivities
are the most likely persons to migrate to the United States).

My empirical

analysis revealed that positive selection was more likely to characterize
ixmnigrants from the advanced industrial countries,

and negative selection

was more likely to characterize iimoigrants from the Third World countries

that form the bulk of migration to the U.S. in the

period.

This paper expands my earlier work in a number of significant ways.

The

theoretical analysis below will argue that although most of the literature
has focused on the role that selection in unobserved characteristicsplays in
determining ixmnigrant earnings, there is also selection in observed characteristics

such as education,

Surprisingly,

it is easy to show that there is

no relationshipbetween the types of selections that are generated in

in,

It is completely possible for the most educated

persons to migrate to the U.S. (i.e., positive selection in education), but
for these persons to be the least productive persons in the population of
highly educated persons (i.e., negative selection in unobserved characteristicS)

yield insights into the process that determines the selection of immigrants

The empirical analysis in this paper expands my previous work in two
ways.

First, it presents a detailed analysis of the U.S. earnings of

immigrants by focusing on the roles played by both selection in observed

It will be seen that a

number of the theoretical predictions are confirmed by the data.

average earnings in the United States labor market.

The necessary and

sofficient condition is:

p < min(-, k)

(10)

In other words, if p is negative or "small", the composition of the
migrant pool is likely to resemble a refugee population.

For instance, it is

likely that p is negative for countries that have recently experienced a
Communist takeover,

After all, the change from a market economy to a

Communist system is often accompanied by structural changes in the income
distribution, and by confiscation of entrepreneurial assets and redistribution to other persons.

The Roy model suggests that immigrants from

such systems will be in the lower tail of the "revolutionary" income
distribution, but will outperform the average U.S. native worker.
The basic Roy model thus provides a useful categorization of the factors
that determine the guality or composition (in terms of unobserved
characteristics) of the migrant pool.

Even at this level, several important

implications are generated which give some insight into a number of empirical
findings in the literature.

For example, many studies have documented the

fact that refugee populations perform quite well in the U.S. labor market

when compared to native workers of similar socioeconomic characteristics.
These empirical results are explained by the income—maximization hypothesis

and by the fact that these refugee populations, prior to the political
changes which led to a worsening of their economic status, were relatively
-10—

well off in the country of origin.

It is, therefore, unnecessary to resort

to the arbitrary distinctions between "economic" and "non-economic" migrants
to explain the refugee experience.
The Roy model also provides an interesting explanation for the empirioal
finding that the quality of migrants to the United States has declined in the
postwar period (where quality is defined by the wage differential between
migrants and natives of the same measured skills) .

Prior to

the 1965

Amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Aot, ixmnigration to the United
States was regulated by numerical quotas.

The distribution of the fixed

number of quotas aoross countries was based on the ethnic population of the
United States in 1919 and thus encouraged migration from (some)

continents, particularly Asia.
characteristic:

The favored countries have one important

their income distributions are probably much less dispersed

than those of countries in Latin America or Asia.

The 1963 Amendments

abolished the discriminatory restrictions against immigration from non—
European countries, established a 20,000 numerical limit for legal migration
from any single country (subject to both Hemispheric and worldwide numerical
limitations) , and led to a substantial increase in the number of migrants
from Asia and Latin America.

The new flow of migrants thus originates in

countries that are much more likely to have greater income inequality than
the United States.5

It would not be surprising, therefore, if the quality of

immigrants declined as a result of the 1965 Amendments.
In addition, the 1965 Amendments led to a fundamental shift in the
mechanism by which visas were allocated among potential migrants.

In

particular, the role played by observable skills and occupational
characteristics was deemphasized, and the role played by family relationships

with relatives currently in the United States became the primary focus of

in the

The Roy model suggests that this change in the statutes

will lead to a substantial decline in immigrant quality.

In particular, the

family of the migrant that resides in the United States provides a "safety
net" that insures the immigrants against poor labor market outcomes and
unemployment periods in the months after immigration.

Low—ability persons who

could not migrate without family connections in the United States, and hence
without that insurance, will now find it worthwhile to do so.

In effect, the

kinship regulations in the immigrat ion law create a lower bound in the income
distribution that low-skilled immigrants face in the United States, and hence
make it more likely that migrants are negatively selected from the
population.

The migration rate is a function of X

ience,

the migration of persons with larger

in the country of origin, and the migration

K

more likely if the country of origin values the characteristic K more than

the United States.

A complementary analysis to the Roy model can be derived

if it is assumed that the vector K consists of only one variable, say
education

(5),

that

this variable is uncorrelated with the disturbances rn

the earnings functions, and that this variable, too, is normally distributed
in the population.

The assumption of only one variable in the vector K is

irrelevant, since the results can be easily generalized to any number of
variables. The assumption of normality, though unrealistic for some socioeconomic characteristics, does simplify the mathematics substantially and
allows a useful extension of the Roy approach to the determination of the
observed income distribution.

The complete samples are used in the creation of

this section, the dependent variable is the logarithm of the

individual's wage rate in the calendar year prior to the Census.

Forty one countries were chosen for analysis.

These countries were

selected on the basis that both the 1970 and 1980 Censuses contained a
substantial number of migrants

from that country.

In particular, it is

necessary to have at least 80 observations cf persons born in a particular
foreign country in the pooled 2/100 1970 Census to enter the sample of 41
countries.

The countries thus chosen account for over 90 percent of all

irmigration to the United States between 1951 and 1980.

It must be noted,

however, that this restriction omits some countries which during the late
l970s became important

source countries (e.g., Vietnam)

.

Since

two

Censuses are reotired for the complete identification of the parameters
of the model presented in Section 3, hcwever, a systematic analysis of
the relative earnings of these migrants will have to await the 1990 Census.
Table 1 begins the empirical analysis by presenting the unstandardired

differential between the log wage rate of the various migrant groups and
"natives".

In these statistics, the native population is defined as the

group of U.S. born white, non-Hispanic, non-Asian men aged 25-64.

Perhaps

the most striking finding in the table is the fact that migrants from

European countries tend to have wage rates that often exceed the wages of
white natives,

while migrants from Asian or Latin American countries tend to

have wage rates that are substantially below those of white natives.

Table 1 also presents the relative earnings of the 1965—1969 cohort cf
migrants as of 1970, the relative earnings of the same cohort in 1980, and
the relative earnings of the 1975—1979 cohort as of 1980.

These statistics

yield important insights into the process of assimilation

(the rate at whicn

the earnings of migrants and nativea are converging) and into the extent of

productivitydifferences across successive cohorts.

Table 2 continues the descriptive analysis by presenting the mean
(completed) education

level of four different cohorts of immigrants that

arrived in the 1960—1980 period.

Since the education data available in the

Census does not differentiate between education obtained prior to
immigration and education obtained in the United States after immigration,
the mean education levels for the 1970—74 and 1975—79 cohorts are obtained

from the 1980 Census, and the mean education levels for the 1960—64 and 1965—
69 cohorts

are obtained from the 1970 Census.

This use of the available

data is designed to minimize the contamination of the education
variable by post—migrationschooling.
The statistics in Table 2 are consistent with the well-known secular

increase in education levels over time for practically all migrant cohorts.

It is worth noting, however, that for some countries
education has been quite small

(e.g., Norway) it has been amazingly

As the theoretical analyais in

Section II shows, these truncated education means can only be understood

in terms of the population means of the education distribution in the
countries of origin.

To provide some insights into the extent of self—

selection on the basis of education,

Table 2 also presents mean education

levels calculated for the population in the countries of origin.

The mean

education level for the lSGOs is calculated using enrollment data in the
various countries

of origin during the 1950s, while the mean education level

for the l970s is calculated using enrollment data in the various countries of

origin during the l960s.

The "lagged" construction of the variable giving

mean education levels in the country of origin is designed to account for the
fact that, in the samples used here, the average person migrated at age 20.

The relevant education distribution, therefore is given by that of persons
enrolled in school a few years earlierJ°
The means in Table 2 present a remarkable picture.

Even after allowing

for the substantial errors involved in calculating the population means for each
country of origin, the truncated means are almost always much greater than
the population means.

For example, the mean of education in Haiti is about 3

years, but the most recent Haitian immigrants report 10 years of education in
the 1980 Census.

Surprisingly, the two statistics are most similar for Mexico,

where both immigrants and the Mexican population have 6-7 years of education.
Overall, Table 2 suggests that immigrants are positively selected on the

basis of education.
consistent

The model presented earlier implies that this result is

with the hypothesis that the "rate of return" to education is

greater in the United States than in most countries of origin.11

the 41 countries under analysis using the pooled 1970 and 1980 Census data.
As noted earlier, the choice of the native baseline is an important step in
the estimation procedure.

In this section, the reference group is chosen

according to the race/ethnic background of the population of each country of
origin.

Second, the unemployment

quality of the migrant pool.

This result is consistent with the Roy model if

unemployment particularly affects the earnings opportunities of low—skilled
workers.

For instance, an increase in the unemployment rate will worsen the

opportunities for persons in the lower end of the ability (i.e., income)

teterminants of Seleotiom in Education

As noted earlier, self-selection

occurs not only on the basis of

unobserved ability, but also on the basis of observed characteristics

such

as education. Table 2 documented that there are strong differences in
educational attainment across immigrant groups from different countries.
addition,

In

it was seen that the observed educational attainment of immigrant

groups differed from the mean educational attainment of the population in the
country of origin.

It is of interest, therefore,

to analyre whether the same

variables that detemmine the extent of differences in unobserved characteristics can also explain the differences in educational attainment
across immigrant groups.

Many of the

variables are stetistioally significant, and the regression has a relatively
high explanatory power: the few variables included in the regression

It is worth noting that the political variables have

significant positive impacts on the level of educational attainment of
immigrants.

Individuals from countries

with politically competitive parties,

or from countries that recently lost their

Finally,

the regression

This confirmation of the theory, however, should be

The size of the recent flows generated by the selfinto each of the three potential countries of

Over the 1959—81 period, about 14.7

million persons legally left the various countries of origin and migrated to
either Australia, Canada, or the United States.

Sixty percent of these

migrants chose the United States as their destination, and the remainder were
evenly split between Australia and Canada.

Migration Policies in Most Countries

One important

constraint

on the size and the composition of the flow of

by the various countries to screen the applicant pool. U.S. immigration

of restricting the migration of persons whose

terms of denying financial assistance

9The construction of the data sets is described in detail in Sorjas
(1987)
10The enrollment data is available in United Nations Educational,
Social, and Cultural Organization (1969,1980). Enrollments are available
for each "level" of education.
The data sources also give the number of
years of education associated with that "level" for each country.
The means presented in Table 2 are calculated using both of these
statistics.

is also consistent with the hypothesis that migration costs are
lower for persons with higher education levels. This hypothesis has
received intensive study in the migration literature; see, for example,
Schwartz (1968)
is important to note that many of these differences in guality
across cohcrts from a given country of origin are statistically significant
at conventional levels. For some evidence on this point see Borjas (1987).
13Since the dependent variable in the "second—stage" regressions is a
linear function of regression coefficients, the regressions are weighted to
account for neteroscedasticity.
See Borjas (1987) for details.

immigration policies given by Soyd (1976), Keely (1979), Keely and Elwel
(1981) , Kubat (1979), and Price (1978)
16Throughout this section, the entire native base in each of the host
countries is the entire population of native—persons (regardless of ethnic
or racial origin) - This differs from the native baselines chosen in the
previous section, but makes the comparisons among host countries less
arbitrary
17There are some differences in the calendar years bracketed by these
dummy variables across the countries of destination. The brackets reported
in the table are those that apply to U.S. data. The Canadian and Australian
brackets are quite similar for post-1960 migrants, but differ for pre—1960
migrants.
18The average was calculatedover the two or three source countries that
formed the bulk of immigration from that continent to the particular host
country.
