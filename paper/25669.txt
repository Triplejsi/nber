JEL No. I13,I15,O55
ABSTRACT
This paper uses a difference-in-difference framework to estimate the effects of mobile money transfer
technology (MMT) on healthcare usage in the face of negative health shocks. We use survey data from
2013-16 with quarterly observations on about 1,600 households of 10 villages in the Kisumu region
of Western Kenya. We find evidence that MMT, likely through greater ease of informal borrowing,
helps households increase utilization of formal healthcare services in terms of visits to a clinic, consultation
and medication expenditures in comparison with the non-users of this technology.

Introduction

Lack of access to financial services restricts the ability of poor households to save and invest and
engage in formal insurance mechanisms (Johnson and Nino-Zarazua 2011; Dupas and Robinson
2009). Therefore, poor households often rely on informal risk sharing mechanisms during
periods of distress. This informal risk sharing and insurance is generally incomplete due to
information asymmetries and transaction costs (Gertler and Gruber 2002; Townsend 1995;
Kochar 1995; Gertler, Levine and Moretti 2006, 2009). Mobile money transfer technology
(MMT) has the potential to improve risk sharing in the presence of income shocks, as it allows
its owners to store monetary value on a mobile phone. This value can be sent or received simply
by text (SMS) messages, thus reducing the transaction costs associated with borrowing and
lending (Jack and Suri 2014; Suri and Jack 2016; Munyegera and Matsumoto 2016;
Blumenstock, Eagle and Fafchamps 2011; Riley 2018; Bharadwaj et al. 2019). 1
The objective of this paper is to test the impact of MMT on risk-sharing in the face of
negative health shocks. Jack and Suri (2014) use a difference-in-difference specification to
examine changes in consumption in response to negative unexpected income and health shocks
across MMT users and non-users. Our paper builds on this work by using the Socio-Economic
Survey (SES) conducted by Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) and by focusing on the impact of MMT adoption on health expenditures and
healthcare use under negative health shocks. Additionally, our focus is on rural households,
whereas Jack and Suri (2014) use a combined sample of urban and rural households. MMT
adoption may be especially important for insurance purposes in rural areas, which often have

To illustrate the reduction in transaction costs, Jack and Suri (2014) document that the average distance of a
person-to-person remittance in Kenya is 200 km, which costs about $5 in travel expenses. With the help of MMT,
funds can be transferred by a simple SMS, saving time and money.

higher poverty rates and less access to formal financial services in developing countries. At the
same time, inadequate MMT agent services in rural areas can discourage households from
adopting this technology (Morawczynski and Pickens 2009).
Effective and accessible healthcare has been recognized as pivotal in improving living
standards and reducing poverty. Credit constraints and the high cost of health services contribute
to keeping more than a billion people in low and middle income countries from using
recommended healthcare (Harris et al. 2011). Given that borrowing within informal networks is
the predominant insurance mechanism among the poorer, unbanked households of the
developing world (Fafchamps and Lund 2003; Gertler, Levine and Moretti 2009; Mobarak and
Rosenzweig 2013), MMT can help households overcome these credit constraints by making it
easier to borrow money from relatives and friends. Healthcare use is particularly important in our
setting as febrile illnesses, diarrheal illnesses and respiratory disorders are endemic in the region
and make up 40.2%, 5% and 54.4% of the health shocks, respectively (Thumbi et al. 2015).
Jack and Suri (2014) show that users of MMT can better smooth consumption for total, food
and other non-health expenditure categories under idiosyncratic negative shocks, while Riley
(2018) shows the potential for consumption smoothing under village-level shocks. In contrast,
our results indicate that the risk sharing effects are concentrated on health expenditures and
healthcare use in the presence of a negative health shock, but other categories of expenditures
(such as those examined by Jack and Suri (2014)) are not affected. By using a different dataset
and focusing specifically on healthcare use, this paper contributes to the literature by showing
that users of MMT, presumably through increased informal borrowing, use more healthcare
services compared to non-users in the presence of health shocks. This suggests that MMT can be
an effective tool for overcoming short-run credit constraints and financing of unplanned and

3

sudden expenditures imposed by illness. This access to credit in the time of need, usually
through informal networks (Fafchamps and Lund 2003; Fafchamps and Gubert 2007), may lead
to timely diagnosis, prevention and treatment of disease, and thus have important repercussions
for household health.
A challenge for our identification strategy is that MMT adoption is endogenous. MMT has
been associated with an increase in the privacy of transactions, thereby providing more freedom
to women in choosing where to spend their money and also improving the gender parity situation
within households (Aker et al. 2011; Jackiela and Ozier 2015). Users of MMT have higher offfarm employment and farm profits, spend cash on more diverse items, sell fewer non-durable
assets and cultivate more diverse crops (Aker et al. 2011; Suri and Jack 2016; Kikulwe et al.
2014).
The validity of our identification strategy rests on the assumption that health shocks are
exogenous. We find that health shocks are uncorrelated with observables, suggesting that these
shocks are exogenous and equally affect users and non-users of MMT. If this is the case, we will
obtain unbiased estimates of the effect of MMT on consumption smoothing as long as
unobserved differences between MMT user and non-users do not vary by health shock status.
Like Jack and Suri (2014), we allow for all observable household characteristics to affect risk
sharing by interacting them with health shocks. This allows us to control for other changes in a
household’s environment that may also affect a household’s consumption smoothing ability.
MMT eases consumption smoothing through liquidation of savings or through increased
remittances and loans. We test the impact of MMT adoption on likelihood of acquiring a loan
(formally or informally) with our difference-in-difference strategy. Since families in Kenya are
dispersed over large distances due to internal migration and employment opportunities (Agesa

4

and Agesa 1999; Jack and Suri 2014), lowering transaction costs can have crucial effects on
frequency and timeliness of needed remittances and loans. We find that MMT users are 5
percentage points more likely to acquire loans than non-users during a negative health shock,
indicating that borrowing may be the main mechanism.
Lastly, we note that households in rural areas may rely on in-kind transfers for consumption
smoothing during health or income shocks, especially if they do not currently have MMT. In
other words, in-kind transfers may be a substitute for cash transfers (via MMT) in the absence of
MMT. We examine this possibility using the quantity of maize received as a gift as the
dependent variable in our difference-in-difference model. We find that the quantity of maize
received as a gift increases for MMT non-users but does not increase for MMT users under a
health shock. This is consistent with the substitution hypothesis. It is important to note these inkind transfers do not lead to increased formal medical care during health shocks the way MMT
does. This may be a result of cash transfers via MMT being more liquid than in-kind transfers,
thus making it easier to put them toward healthcare expenditures.

Background and Data

Mobile money was introduced in Africa in 2007 and its adoption grew steadily over time. MMT
services are provided by several telecom companies, namely Safaricom, Airtel, Orange and Essar
in Kenya. The owners of MMT can exchange cash for e-money at any “mobile money agent”
locations. They can also send this money to anyone in the country with a text message, even if
the recipient is not a registered mobile money holder and even if the phone operates on another
network. Depositing funds for e-money is free, while an SMS costs about 30 Kenyan Shillings

5

(40 cents). Withdrawals are charged at about 1-2 percent and the price is higher if the recipient is
not a registered owner of MMT or uses a different cellular network than the sender. 2
Our data have been drawn from the longitudinal Socio-Economic Survey (SES) 3, conducted
in the Kisumu Region, near Lake Victoria, of Kenya. The SES is compiled from quarterly visits
to about 1600 households in 10 villages. The survey period in this paper is roughly from
February 2013 to December 2016.
Table 1 provides descriptions of the variables. Table 2 provides the means and standard
deviations of the variables of interest. Average Total Expenditure during a quarter is about
10,127.8 Kshs. (~$101) with education and other expenditures constituting the largest
expenditure categories. Other expenditures may include expenditures related to livestock and
crop farming or recreation. The average healthcare expenditure for households during a quarter
is 516.46 (~$5).
We define healthcare use through three variables; Visits Made to a clinic, whether or not
medication expenditure was incurred (Medication), and whether or not a consultation fee was
paid (Consultation), all during the last quarter. Visits Made to a clinic indicates the number of
visits to a formal healthcare facility but does not indicate if such a facility was used to buy
medicines or for doctor consultation. In the region, one of the hospitals charges no consultation
fee and the Visits Made variable in such a case may only capture opportunity cost of time and
transportation costs. We also want to examine if users of MMT are more likely to use this
technology for medication expenditures or consultation expenditures or both.

Registration only requires a National ID card or Passport. Detailed information regarding pricing for one of
the cellular service is available at https://www.safaricom.co.ke/personal/m-pesa/getting-started/m-pesa-rates

This survey was launched by Paul G. Allen School for Global Animal Health at Washington State University
in collaboration with the Kenya Medical Research Institute and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(known as the KEMRI/CDC Research and Public Health Collaboration) and the University of Washington with a
goal to reduce poverty and hunger and improve health and education.

Average adoption rates of MMT over the survey period are shown in Figure 1. The user rate
of MMT remains around 60 percent at the household level in our sample during all time periods
while the overall cell phone ownership remains around 70 percent. In our region and sample, the
rate of penetration of this technology hasn't been increasing over time, whereas other studies of
mobile money report an increasing trend in the adoption of this technology (Munyegera and
Matsumoto 2016; Jack and Suri 2011, 2014). Barriers to use this technology include failed
transactions, dissatisfaction over mobile carriers’ customer service and cash shortages especially
in rural areas (Morawczynski and Pickens 2009).
Shock is an indicator variable equal to 1 if any household member has been sick (could not
go to work or go to school) in the past 3 months, 0 otherwise. In the sample, health shocks are
the most dominant shocks compared to livestock health shocks and crop loss. On average, 42%
of the households report illness incidence within the household in the preceding quarter. In some
of the time periods, as high as 52% of households report illness, suggesting that risk due to
disease is a prominent issue in these households. Figure 2 illustrates the proportion of households
that experience the shock during each survey period.
Table 2 also reports the level of cash savings and the percentage of households that take a
loan (formally or informally) during the survey period. 10% of the households report that they
took a loan during the survey period. Only 44% of the population reported that they had positive
cash savings, and mostly the savings were less than 5,000 Kshs. (~$50). There were significant
differences in the wealth of households. The wealth variable is constructed from farm and offfarm incomes, value of livestock and value of crop inventory. This component of wealth can also
be thought of as savings, since livestock are often used as precautionary savings assets (McPeak

7

2006). Other assets that could help in risk sharing like acres of land owned and ownership of a
phone enter as independent variables in the analysis.

Empirical Framework

Our focus is to determine the impact of MMT on consumption and healthcare use in the face of
health shocks. Following Jack and Suri (2014), we employ the following difference-in-difference
specification to test whether consumption and healthcare usage of users and non-users of MMT
differs under health shocks:
𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜆𝜆𝜆𝜆𝜆𝜆𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜇𝜇𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜃𝜃𝑠𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
+ 𝛿𝛿𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(1)

where 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is (a) expenditures for different consumption categories, and (b) healthcare

usage captured by visits to a clinic or expenditures on medication and consultation, in household
𝑖𝑖, village 𝑣𝑣, and time 𝑡𝑡. 𝑠𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the household reported illness
in the preceding quarter and 0 otherwise. 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a dummy variable equal to 1 if any member

of the household is a user of mobile money technology and 0 otherwise. 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 represents a

household fixed effect that controls for unobserved time-invariant household characteristics. 4

The inclusion of household fixed effects implies that only those that switch MMT status over the
quarters contribute to estimation of 𝜆𝜆̂. 𝛿𝛿𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 are village by time dummy variables that control for

time variant village-level heterogeneity. 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 contains occupational dummy variables, a dummy

for whether a household owns a mobile phone or not, travel time to the hospital/clinic, dummies
for highest educational attainment of the household, total adult household members and children,

4

Household and time fixed effects explain 36% of the variation in MMT status. We examine the sensitivity of
our results to removing household fixed effects in Appendix Tables 1 and 2. In general, our results are quite similar
with and without these effects included in the model.

8

total household wealth, household's savings level, and owned acres. This empirical strategy also
closely emulates Gertler and Gruber (2002), Gertler, Levine and Moretti (2006, 2009) and
Robinson and Yeh (2011).
There are two main concerns that may cause problems in the interpretation of 𝛽𝛽 in the above

specification. First is the exogeneity of the health shock. The validity of our identification

strategy rests on the assumption that health shocks are exogenous and are equally likely to affect
users and non-users of MMT. If health shocks are correlated with unobservables that affect MMT
adoption, then 𝛽𝛽 may not capture the causal effect of MMT use on risk sharing.

Following Jack and Suri (2014), we test the exogeneity of health shocks by examining if they are
correlated with adoption of MMT and a number of household-level variables.
𝑠𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝜂𝜂𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜌𝜌𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 + 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(2)

The results for this regression are reported in Table 3. A significant effect of 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 on 𝑠𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜

would cause concern about selection bias: it may indicate that individuals who experience health
shocks are more likely to obtain MMT or that both health shocks and MMT adoption are
correlated with the same unobservables (either positively or negatively). We cannot reject the
null hypothesis of zero effect of MMT on 𝑠𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜, alleviating this concern. Furthermore, we do

not find evidence of strong correlations between 𝑠𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 and wealth and education variables,

which suggests that 𝑠𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 is also uncorrelated with the unobserved error term (Pei, Pischke and
Schwandt 2017). Predictably, health shocks are correlated with number of children and adult
members of the household. However, MMT adoption is not correlated with these variables,
therefore the correlation between health shock and household size does not appear to be
problematic in our estimation. 5
5

MMT use might help households reduce the risk of future health shocks. We added past MMT use and its
interaction with past health shock in equation (2) and found small and statistically insignificant effects.

9

The second main concern regards the endogeneity of MMT: why do some households adopt
MMT while others do not? Along these same lines, since MMT is correlated with observables
like education, owning a cell phone, and wealth, it may be the case that it is correlated with
unobserved variables that affect our dependent variables (such as expenditures or healthcare
visits) as well. This will only be a problem to the extent that any difference between MMT users
and non-users varies by health shock status. We follow Jack and Suri's (2014) strategy of
allowing the effects of all observables to vary by health shock status as well, limiting the
potential for the interaction between MMT and the health shock to be partially due to
unobservables.
To further examine our assumption that unobserved differences by MMT status do not vary
by health shock status, we plot trends in health expenditures for MMT users and non-users two
quarters before and after a health shock. Figure 3 maps the pre- and post-shock means of
healthcare expenditures unadjusted for right-hand side variables. Figure 4 shows means that are
adjusted for right-hand side variables. Figures 3 and 4 illustrate that while MMT users
consistently spend more on healthcare than non-users, there is no noticeable differential trend
prior to a health shock. Furthermore, the larger difference in expenditures for MMT users that
occurs in the quarter of a shock disappears in the two periods following the shock. These
findings support the parallel trends assumption of our difference-in-difference framework.
The differences in the extent of consumption smoothing between users and non-users of
MMT may arise from their borrowing behavior. The ability to obtain a loan, especially from an
informal channel, should respond more to shocks for MMT users as compared to non-users. To
test for this mechanism of risk-sharing, we examine the impact of MMT on loans with the
following linear probability model.

where 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a dummy variable equal to 1 if household acquired a loan (formally or

informally) in the past quarter and 0 otherwise, while right-hand side variables are the same as in
Equation (1). 6
Furthermore, if MMT users rely on loans for risk-sharing, then the quantity of in-kind
transfers and gifts should be less responsive to shock for MMT users (if in-kind transfers and
cash loans via MMT are substitutes). To test if MMT substitutes for in-kind transfers, we examine
the impact of MMT on the quantity of maize received as a gift (Maize Gift) with the following
linear model.
𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜆𝜆𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜇𝜇𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

Standard errors are clustered at the household level in all regressions to account for the serial
and intra-household correlation in errors for all regression specifications.

Results

Effect on Expenditures
The results of the difference-in-difference regressions for per capita expenditures in different
categories under a health shock are reported in Table 4. 7 Column 1 shows that all households

6

Our data does not specify whether the loan was acquired via a formal or an informal channel. Therefore, we
are unable to estimate the extent to which MMT affects loans through formal or informal channels separately.
7
Since the dependent variable is in natural logarithms in many of our regressions and our variables of interest
are dummy variables, the transformation of multiplying estimators by 100 and interpreting them as percentage
changes is erroneous (Halvorsen and Palmquist 1980; Garderen and Shah 2002). To calculate percentage changes,
we use Kennedy’s (1981) transformation of our coefficients in all semi-logarithmic regressions. Kennedy’s

experience a large jump in health expenditures during a shock. However, users of MMT spend
about 63% (p-value < 0.001) more per capita on healthcare than the non-users during a shock, or
roughly one-third more than the increase for households without MMT. This is consistent with
the idea that MMT helps alleviate cash constraints during periods when households need medical
attention.
Looking across the other columns of Table 4, it is apparent that health shocks have little
effect on non-health expenditures (individually or all together) for both MMT users and nonusers. 8 This is in contrast to Jack and Suri (2014), who find that health shocks decrease the nonhealth consumption of those who do not have MMT but that MMT alleviates this consumption
risk. It is worth noting that Jack and Suri (2014) focus on shocks experienced in the past six
months while the recall period in our data is 3 months. Under a longer recall period, respondents
may only remember very severe shocks and may under-report less severe illness events (Bound
et al. 2001). This difference in severity of shocks may explain the difference in estimates in the
two papers. Health shocks at the household level may also be predominantly focused on
vulnerable members like children (and other non-earning members of the household) (Black,
Morris and Bryce 2003; Hsu et al. 2015) and therefore have little effect on earnings. 9
Our results are in line with the results presented by Genoni (2012), Islam and Maitra (2012),
Townsend (1994), and Kochar (1995) who suggest that nonmedical and food expenditures may
be well insured against household illness. Consumption smoothing in food may occur through
storage, in-kind gifts within informal networks, and substitution between on-farm production and

Robustness checks for per capita expenditure regressions are provided in the Table A1 of the Appendix.
Results for health, total non-health and total expenditures are robust to the inclusion of fewer controls than in the
models presented in Table 4.

market purchases rather than borrowing cash (Asfaw and Braun 2004; De Weerdt and Dercon
2006). Similarly, education expenditure can be easily forecasted as such expenses are usually
incurred at the beginning of the school term, whereas health expenditures may be incurred as a
surprise (Marsh et al. 2016; Bharadwaj et al. 2019).
Our findings that non-health expenditures are generally not affected by negative health
shocks and that the effect of MMT is concentrated in healthcare expenditures could be the result
of different things. Households may be unable or unwilling to adjust other parts of their budget
to pay for medications and healthcare services or it could be that such expenses are small enough
that they are able to keep other forms of consumption relatively constant over the quarter.
Nevertheless, if households are liquidity constrained in the short run when acute health shocks
arise (Beegle, Dehejia and Gatti 2003; Dupas 2009; Cohen and Dupas 2010; Bharadwaj et al.
2019), MMT could help them overcome these constraints by availing their social networks for
loans or gifts to pay for needed healthcare (Fafchamps and Lund 2003; Fafchamps and Gubert
2007; De Weerdt and Dercon 2006).
The last thing we note about Table 4 is that the MMT dummy variable is positively and
significantly related to per capita expenditures in most of the consumption categories, indicating
that adoption of MMT is perhaps correlated with unobserved changes in a household’s financial
situation or other variables that affect expenditures. This is a weakness of our approach, since if,
under a health shock, health expenditures increased more for MMT users than non-users for
other (unobserved) reasons. Though we cannot rule this possibility out entirely, we present
results later in this section on the acquisition of loans during health shocks that are consistent
with the notion that MMT itself is responsible for this difference.
Effect on Healthcare Use
13

Table 5 provides estimates of the impact of MMT on Visits Made to a clinic/hospital (Column 1),
Medication (Column 2) and Consultation (Column 3) in the presence of health shock. MMT
users visit formal healthcare facility 0.48 times more or roughly two-third times more during a
shock than the households without MMT. Similarly, users of MMT are 16 percentage points more
likely to purchase medication, i.e., an almost 50% increase in the likelihood of purchasing
medication than non-users during health shocks. Furthermore, users of MMT are 15 percentage
points more likely to spend on doctor consultation fees during health shocks than the non-users.
In other words, MMT users are twice as likely as non-users to spend on consultation fees during a
shock. All of these estimates are statistically significant at the 1% level (p-value < 0.001).
Regressions without household fixed effects and fewer covariates are provided in Appendix
(Table 2A). 10
These results provide evidence on the role of MMT in increasing healthcare utilization during
periods of illness. Even though formal healthcare facilities are inadequate in developing
countries (Das, Hammer, and Leonard 2008), pursuing formal healthcare can still significantly
improve health outcomes through timely receipt of treatment and important medication like antimalarials and oral rehydrate salts (Adhvaryu and Nyshadham 2015). The Kisumu region is
associated with high malarial incidence as well as respiratory and digestive problems (Thumbi et
al. 2015) and timely medication like anti-malarials or oral-rehydrate salts can significantly
improve symptoms for those affected.
Table 6 examines explicitly the role of MMT in the likelihood of the household acquiring a
loan. The Took Loan variable documents loans from formal as well as informal sources. Users of

10

MMT may have an impact on some of the control variables like savings. Therefore, controlling for savings
may cause ambiguities in the interpretation of the effect of MMT on risk-sharing. However, results from
specifications without covariates (Table 2A) do not significantly differ from the results presented in Table 5,
indicating that MMT has a small role to play in terms of changing savings of the households.

14

MMT are 13 percentage points more likely to acquire a loan in general and about 2 to 5
percentage points more likely to acquire a loan in the face of health shocks, compared to nonusers, depending on different specifications. This is suggestive of borrowing being the
mechanism by which health expenditures rise during an adverse health shock, where borrowing
is aided by MMT. 11
Lastly, we note that households can rely on in-kind transfers like gifts of maize and livestock
for risk sharing (McPeak 2006). If borrowing via MMT is indeed responsible for users spending
more on healthcare during health shocks than non-users, then MMT users may be able to rely less
on in-kind transfers. Table 7 examines the quantity of maize received as a gift (Maize Gift)
during health shocks. We find that there is an increase of 5 to 9 percent in the amount of maize
received by non-user households during health shocks. However, the negative and offsetting
coefficient on Shock*MMT suggests that MMT users do not experience this increase of in-kind
transfers during negative health shocks. These results are consistent with the notion that cash
transfers via MMT substitute for in-kind transfers during periods of (health) distress.

Conclusion

This paper examines the role of MMT on risk sharing in consumption and builds on the work of
Jack and Suri (2014) by focusing on healthcare expenditures and use in the face of negative
health shocks. To the extent that financial services are unavailable in rural areas of developing
countries, MMT can fill a valuable role for the unbanked rural poor by providing access to cash
transfers from one’s social network.

11

Our estimates of borrowing will be underestimated to the extent that remittances from kin are based on
relationships of reciprocity and may not be counted as loans by households.

15

We find that during times of illness, users of MMT spend 63% more per capita on health, are
50% more likely to buy medication, are almost two times more likely to pay consultation fees,
and utilize more formal healthcare facilities than non-users of the technology. Previous studies
related to MMT adoption illustrate that use of MMT is associated with increased borrowing and
remittances. We also show that users of MMT acquire more loans and rely less on in-kind
transfers during health shocks. These results imply that digital financial services like MMT can
be used to overcome credit or liquidity constraints that hamper the ability of the households to
use necessary healthcare.
Self-insurance against health shocks due to MMT is important in the short run but may have
even more important longer-run consequences on household welfare and poverty if utilization of
healthcare services decrease mortality and long-term illness. Furthermore, if MMT adoption
allows households to better utilize geographically dispersed social networks, it may replace or
alter traditional local-level risk sharing relationships and institutions, as suggested by our results
related to maize transfers among households. Estimating overall welfare impacts, changes in
risk-sharing institutions and long-run consequences of MMT are topics for future work.
