We examine the behavior of governments concerned solely with

minimizing the deadweight loss from raising revenue through inflation and tax
finance.

We show that both governments that can commit to future policy actions,

as well as those that cannot precommit, will choose a positive contemporaneous
association between inflation and the level of tax burdens.

We examine the

empirical validity of this prediction using data from Britain, France, Germany,
Japan, and the United States,

Inflation and tax rates are as likely to be

negatively as positively correlated, so the results cast doubt on the empirical
relevance of simple models in which governments with time-invariant tastes choose
monetary policy to equate the marginal deadweight burdens of inflation and taxes.

different from that when it cannot.

In his model, unanticipated inflation is

more attractive ax post than
anticipated inflation.

Unanticipated inflation is

at least in part a "taking," with the government expropriating consumers' wealth
by reducing the value of real money balances.

Anticipated inflation, on the

other hand, also distorts behavior by leading consumers to economize on real
money balances.

grounds, however.

The commitcent

We know of no examples in

which monetary policy is regulated by law, much less
by an irrevocable monetary
constitution.

Commitment, if it exists, must therefore be enforced by zeputa-

tional considerations.

Existing models in this spirit2 rely on the ability of

consumers to change their behavior if the government deviates from the
reputational equilibrium, a discipline that will only operate if households can
identify government deviations from equilibrium strategies.

Such identification

may however be extremely difficult in practice if the reputational equilibrium
involves the kind of fluctuations in
monetary policy that we regularly observe.
Models without commitment have a
separate difficulty.

Without cormitment,

the government at each point in time
may view increases in the price level as a
lump aum tax.

Inflation is therefore a least-cost instrument for raising

revenue, so other taxes would not be used.

We believe models with this charac-

teristic take an overly simplistic view of the
government's preferences, and we

The marginal deadweight burden of tax finance also rises with

An optimizing government which equates the marginal social costs

of obtaining revenue from inflation and taxation will therefore raisa both the
inflation rate and tax rates in response to higher revenue demands.

Although it has no bearing on the prediction of a positive correlation
between inflation and tax rates, resolving whether governments can precommit to
monetary policy is of central importance for evaluating the welfare effects of
inflation.

On dimensions other than the contemporaneous correlation between tax

rates and inflation, the possibility of committment affects the predictions of

optimizingmodels,

We focus on one such difference.

Unanticipated inflation

reduces the value of outstanding nominal government debt.

A government that

cannot restrict its future actions will therefore find it more attractive to
inflate when the stock of outstanding nominal debt is large.

This temptation

does not arise for a government that has committed to future policies, so the
correlation between the debt stock and inflation may prove useful in distinguishing models with and without commitment.

Unfortunately we also show that if the

government can tax outstanding government debt without resorting to the inflation
tax, then the correlation of inflation with various measures of nominal liabilities does not depend on the possibility of commitment.
Readers who pay serious attention to the actual pronouncements of policy
makers may believe that revenue considerations have no place in a positive theory

of monetary policy.

Central bankers rarely, if ever, mention the seigniorage

-4that results from alternative monetary policies.

While we view this as evidence

against the class of optimizing models studied below, and this skepticism is con-

firmed by our empirical findings, it might nevertheless be possible to reconcile
the actual speeches of policy-makers with the optimizing government models.

When

government spending is high governments tend to raise taxes and also to increase
debt finance.

Central bankers who react by purchasing government bonds with

newly minted money, thereby raising seigniorage revenues, may rationalize this
behavior with feat of high interest rates generated by large government debt

scocks.

Theic behavior may however be consistent with the predictions of

positive models of government based on deadweight burden minimization.
Our analysis of inflation and taxation is divided into two parts,

The first

part, which consists of sections 1 through III, develops the theory while the

second part presents the empirical tests. Section 1 considers the classic case
of inflation and tax choice when the government is able to commit.

Section II

assumes instead that committmenc is impossible and that the government is unable

to tax govecnment bonds directly.

The third section introduces bond taxation in

a model without commirrent and shows its implications are similar to those of the
commitment case.

Section IV studies the empirical relationship between taxes and

inflation in the U.S., U.K., Japan, West Germany and France.

We show that a

positive association between inflation and the level of tax burdens obtains only
in the U.S. and Japanese data;

behavior such as those analyzed here are incapable of explaining monetary and

Inflation and Taxation with Precommittment
This section models an optimizing government's choice of inflation and tax

rates when committment is possible and when these policies are chosen only with
regard to their revenue effects.

The government's objective is to minimize the

function is not just intended to

capture the distortionary effects of inflation on the demand for money, as in the

work of Drazen (1979), Phelps

(1973),

Kimbrough (1986) and Lucas (1986).

Instead, it reflects the many possible consequences of inflation enumerated by
Fischer and Modigliani (l978).

In particular, the government might be concerned

with the distributional consequences of inflation as well as with the difficulties inflation introduces in a world with pervasive nominal contracts.

The

specification of inflation's cost in (I) is therefore more general than that
which would emerge from explicit analysis of a representative consumer economy.
The government's budget constraint is described by the evolution of real
4Because we consider relatively many effects of inflation, there is no
presumption, as in the more narrow models of Kimbrough (1986) or Faig (1987),
that the optimal tax rate on money is given by the Friedman rule. This presumption actually disappears as soon as money services are not viewed as perfect
substitutes for other arguments in the utility function (see Romer (1987)).

given inflation rate is high since, with commitment, revenue from inflation is
obtained at t+l as people replenish the money that has been depleted by inflation.

and the lower the relative cost of inflstion.6

Inflation and Tax Policy without Committment or Bond Taxes

We now consider the government's choice of inflation and tax rates when
committment is impossible.

This implies that the government in period t can only

is more costly when money holdings are higher. While this might be true when the

The level of nominal bonds

affects inflation in the previous section's model because inflation is the only

way to tax these bonds.

We now consider a model in which the government can also

levy direct taxes on government bonds, and show that it is much more difficult to
distinguish between scenarios with and without commitment.

If the government can tax government bonds at rate r, real debt evolves as:

since if a modification of the bond tax is known in advance,

nominal interest rates will adjust to keep after-tax returns constant.
Without commitment, however, a government would not use distortionary taxes

if increasing direct taxes on government bonds were possible and if such taxes
were perceived to be costless.

To explain the existence of other taxes and

inflation, direct bond expropriations must therefore be perceived as costly.9

Rotemberg (1987) explores a model in which the government cares directly for the
welfare of the bondholders.

By the argument in the previous section, money demand as well as interest
rates at t depend only on the level of bonds and not on the revenue mix between
taxes and inflation.

The government at t must therefore be indifferent to small

changes in the composition of revenue which leave

b unaffected.

Although the two first

Regardless of whether the government can precom-

government realizes that raising expected inflation reduces desired real money

For example, the two cases differ in their implications for the

intertemporal behavior of tax rates,

An optimizing government that is able to

commit must be indifferent between the actual path of taxes and an alternative

path which raises one additional dollar of revenue today and one less dollar (in
present value terms) tomorrow,

Barro (1979) has shown this implies that tax

rates must follow a martingale:

Equation (13) shows that the expected tax rate change is related to expected

The sign of this relationship, however, will depend upon the second

derivatives of money demand with respect to inflation and taxes.

Our analysis is confined to taxes levied by the

The stocks of money and debt are measured as mid-year

The results of estimating equation (14) for a variety of different sample
periods are shown Table 1.

The tax rate is positively correlated with the

inflation rate for all of the sample periods, but the strength of this correlation is strongest for the post-World War II period.

For the entire 1891-1986

period, a ten percentage point increase in the share of taxes in GNP predicts a
one half of one percentage point increase in the inflation rate.

similar, with slightly larger effects of the tax rate on inflation in the latter
equations.

For the period since 1919 but excluding World War II, the coefficient

estimates are close to those for the full sample, although now the null hypothesis of no tax effect on inflation cannot be rejected at standard levels.
This conclusion is reversed when the sample is restricted to the post-war
period.

A

ten percent of GNP increase in taxes now raises the inflation rate by

approximately 3.4 percent, and the impact coefficient is estimated much more
precisely than for the longer sample periods.

When the Barro-Sahasakul marginal

tax rate series is used in place of the tax-to-GNP ratio, the estimated inflation
effect of a tax increase is smaller.

A ten percentage point rise in the marginal

tax rate raises the inflation rate by just under two percentage points.

The failure of the estimates of equation (14) to reflect positive association between tax rates and inflation might he due to an incorrect apecification.

equivalent to the non-nested hypothesia teat of the null hypothesis that one
variable affects the inflation tate against the alternative that the other
variable affects it.

For the U.S., Germany, and Japan, including both variables

yields a negstive coefficient on the liability variable but a positive and
usually statistically significant coefficient on the money variable.

For France

both variables have positive but statistically insignificant coefficients, while
for Britain both are positive and statistically significant, but the coefficient

on money ia roughly three times as large as that on the broader liability
measure.

Overall, the results are more aupportive of a specification including

the ratio of lagged money to ON? than the total level of government liabilities.
The final empirical issue we address concerns the links between intertemporal changes in tax rates and other government choices, notably inflation.

In

the last section we showed that with commitment the tax rate should evolve as a
martingale, while in the nc commitment case future tax rates should be partially
predictable using lagged inflation rates.

We explore this question by estimating

simple regression models relating the change in the tax-to-ON? ratio between
periods t-l and t to the inflation rate in period t-l:

In four of the five nations,

high inflation predicts an increase in the level of taxation.

In the U.S. and

France a one percent increase in the inflation rate predicts an increase of
approximately one half of one percent in the tax-to-GNP ratio.

The finding for

France is statistically significant at conventional levels, while in the U.S. th
null hypothesis that inflation cannot forecast tax changes would be rejected at
the 10 percent level.

In Britain and Germany each percentage point of inflation

predicts higher taxes of approximately one quarter of one percent of CNP, with
the British results rejecting the null hypothesis of no effects at high confidence levels.

Finally, in Japan, there is a negative but imprecisely estimate

relationship between the inflation rate and the change in tax burdens.

These

the
findings are potentially interesting because provide evidence against
martingale models of taxation developed by Barro (1979) and others,15

and

because they provide weak evidence against the assumption that governments can
precommit to future actions.

V.

Conclusions
The view that taxes and inflation are chosen by deadweight-loss minimizing

governments, using both instruments to raise revenue, cannot explain
that higher taxes are just as often associated with lower as with higher inflation.

Several explanations may be advanced to account for our results,

Inflation will also be lower, unless the

The positive correlation implied by the deadweight-loss minimization

-

An unindexed tax aystem which raises corporate tax burdens

during inflationary periods because depreciation is based on historic cost, for
example, generates a positive association between tax rates and inflation.

A final possibility is that the government's objective function which guides
inflation and tax policy varies over time.

This could explain our findings,

regardless of whether inflation is chosen on the basis of revenue or stabilization considerations.

The perceived costs of inflation and taxes may change with

the political perty in power, shifts in voter preferences, or changes in the
transactions or tax-collecting technology.8 Alesina and Sachs

(1988) provide

aome support for the view that different political parties in the United States

have different aacroeconomic preferences, and Hibbs (1986) doonments apparent
variation through time in the inflation-unemployment preferences of the U.S.
electorate.

If governments that are willing to tolerate inflation also like

expansionary policies in general, then total revenues will decline in periods of

high inflation, reinforcing the negative inflation-tax correlation.19
The view that negative inflation-tax correlations are due to unstable
government tastes is mildly supported by the fact that countries with more stable
governments and less diverse political parties, such as postwar Japan and the
United States, exhibit positive tax-inflation correlstions.

Countries with more

political instability, such as Britain and France, tend to exhibit negative
correlations.

Tax Dynamics Without Commitment or Direct Bond Taxation

In an equilibrium of the game between successive governments which cannot
commit to the path of the money supply, the government must always be indifferent
between maintaining the equilibrium level of taxes and changing taxes by a slight
amount.

Otherwise, given the differentiability of our problem, the current

government would change taxes.

By raising taxes slightly today, the government

The reason such slight tax increases are not detrimental

must be that, in equilibrium, such a tax increase would lead future governments
to lower taxes.

This expected fall in taxes at, say, time t+j raises welfare by

This appendix derives a dynamic relationship for taxes by developing
this indifference between current and future taxes.

We consider an equilibrium in which the contingent path for tax rates and
inflation is

For simplicity, we focus on the case in which income

is a constant.

We starr by analyz-

ing what happens if the government at t raises its taxes slightly.

Individuals

and firms will rationally anticipate rhar taxes and inflation will be lower in
the future.

Current real money balances therefore rise while current nominal

interest rates fall; if the Fisher effect holds, the real rate is unsffected.

In

the next period, there is an as yet unspecified equilibrium change in taxes

(d9÷1)

and inflation

(dF/P+1).

These changes causs the end of period debt at

t+l to differ from the level which would have prevailed in the absence of the
period t tax increase by:

The government at t+l must also be indifferent with respect to small changes

in tax rates.

This means that the present discounted value of the welfare costs

from period r+l forward must be the same whether the government at t÷l levies

The tax rate given by (A2) hss the festure that real debt at the end of period
t+l is the same as it would hsve been had the government at t not deviated from
the equilibrium path.

If the government at t+l imposed this tax, then govern-

ments after t+l would abide by the original equilibrium path.
The indifference of the government at

ti-i

enables us to compute the welfare

consequences of tax changes at t by pretending that taxes at t+l will be used to
offset the period t tax increaee,

This computation yields the total welfare

effect of a tax increase at t:

The three tecra in this expression represent the cost of the extra period t
taxee, the cost of the extra t+l taxes under the counterfactual assumption that
taxes are given by (Al)

,

and the cost of the increased inflation between t and

t+i respectively.
Using equation (10) and the requirement that government at t must be
indifferent with respect to smaii changes in taxes (setting dW — 0 in (A3)) we
obtain:

Thia expresaron is similar to the random walk expression (12) which obtains with

but differa by inclusion of the term (kPt/Pt+i)(dmr/d9t).

This

tern

is present because when the government at t raises tsxes. agents expect lower
inflation and real money balances rise.

This increases government revenue, so

taxes can fall tomorrow by more than R times the current tax increase.

Since tax

deadweight burden of taxes tomorrow must be low relative to that given in (5); in
