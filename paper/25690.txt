The Term Structure of Equity Risk Premia

NBER Working Paper No. 25690

JEL No. E0
ABSTRACT
We use traded equity dividend strips from U.S., Europe, and Japan from 2004-2017 to study the
slope of the term structure of equity dividend risk premia. In the data, a robust finding is that the
term structure of dividend risk premia (growth rates) is positively (negatively) sloped in
expansions and negatively (positively) sloped in recessions. We develop a consumption-based
regime switching model which matches these robust data-features and the historical probabilities
of recession and expansion regimes. The unconditional population term structure of dividend-risk
premia in the regime-switching model, as in standard asset pricing models (habits and long-run
risks), is increasing with maturity. The regime-switching model also features a declining average
term structure of dividend risk-premia if recessions are over-represented in a short sample, as is
the case in the data sample from Europe and Japan. In sum, our analysis shows that the empirical
evidence in dividend strips is entirely consistent with a positively sloped term structure of
dividend risk-premia as implied by standard asset pricing models.

Introduction

We use traded equity dividend strips from U.S., Europe, and Japan from 2004-2017
to study the slope of the term structure of equity discount rates. We find, across all
regions, that the term structure of dividend yields is upward sloping in expansions and
downward sloping in recessions while the term structure of expected dividend growth
rates is downward sloping in expansions and upward sloping in recessions. We develop a
consumption-based regime-switching model (similar to Campbell and Cochrane (1999)
and Bansal and Yaron (2004)) which captures these regime-based data features. This
regime-switching model, as in the Campbell and Cochrane (1999) and Bansal and Yaron
(2004) models, implies that the unconditional slope of the equity dividend risk-premium
is positive. We use this model and the data on dividend strips to argue that the evidence
on dividend discount rates, in contrast with the arguments made in Binsbergen and
Koijen (2017), is entirely consistent with the positive slope implications of standard
asset pricing models (Habits and Long Run Risks (LRR)).
Existing research, Binsbergen, Brandt, and Koijen (2012), Binsbergen, Hueskes, Koijen, and Vrugt (2013), Binsbergen and Koijen (2016), and Binsbergen and Koijen
(2017), argues that “dividend strips data facts are difficult to reconcile with traditional macro-finance models.” Using different modeling and data-analysis we arrive
at an entirely different conclusion. We find considerable support in the data for the
unconditional strip-yield implications of standard macrofinance models. Our data analysis differs from these papers on three fronts: (i) we use a somewhat longer historical
sample and, unlike earlier papers, explicitly acknowledge that the short sample of dividend strip data, running from 2004 till 2017, does not accurately represent the long run
balance of expansions and recessions, (ii) using the longer historical dividend sample
we use Bayesian Vector Autoregression (BVAR) methods to conduct true out-of-sample
analysis of growth rate forecasts and model comparisons and show that our conditional
conclusions are robust to the elimination of look-ahead bias, and (iii) we focus on expected hold-to-maturity returns (i.e., dividend discount rates), which are robust to the
illiquidity of this market, rather than monthly holding period returns, which also tend
to be smaller than average bid-ask spreads. The difference in conclusions is driven
largely by our analysis; while we have a somewhat longer data sample compared to
Binsbergen and Koijen (2017), the overlapping period of our data set (which is most of
the data) and that used in Binsbergen and Koijen (2017) is the same.

2
An important input in computing the discount rates and dividend risk premia for the
dividend strips is a model for dividend growth rates. We conduct real-time forecasting of dividend growth rates by relying on a Bayesian Vector Autoregression (BVAR)
framework which allows us to optimally exploit information in forecasting variables with
longer histories (beyond our short sample) through priors. Our BVAR representation
is general enough to nest forecasting models from the literature, enabling model selection via marginal likelihood comparison. We formally show that our approach, for
example, has a higher marginal likelihood and superior forecast accuracy when compared to Binsbergen, Hueskes, Koijen, and Vrugt (2013). The use of predictors with
longer data samples allows us to formally conduct out-of-sample forecasting analysis and
demonstrate that the conditional conclusions are consistent with the in-sample analysis
using either the long-sample predictors (LSP’s) which are the focus of this paper or
the short-sample predictors (SSP’s) of previous work. Thus, our forecasting framework
enables us to more precisely measure conditional variation in the expected growth and
risk-premium term structures, variation which is robust to model specification and the
elimination of look-ahead bias.
The expected hold-to-maturity returns (dividend discount rates) are measured by
adding the observed dividend yields by maturity to the expected dividend growth rates
by horizon. In terms of the key data findings we find that, across all countries, discount
rates and dividend risk-premia rise with maturity during economic expansions and
decline with maturity in recessions. Expected growth rates, on the other hand, fall with
maturity in expansions and rise with maturity in recessions. While these conditional
aspects of the data are robust, the estimates (using 14 years of data) for the sample
average slope of discount rates and growth rates are noisy and estimated with large
standard errors. The average dividend risk-premium slope is positive for the U.S.,
zero for Japan, and negative for Europe. The average slopes are quite sensitive to
the frequency of expansions and recessions; if the short sample oversamples recessions
the average slope can be negative even if its population value is positive. Indeed, in
both Europe and Japan the short sample from 2004-2017 has a significantly higher
frequency of recessions relative to their long run historical frequency. In the data the
sample average discount rate slope is statistically significantly positive in the U.S., where
recession frequency is in line with historical means, and is measured with large standard
errors in Europe and Japan where recessions are overrepresented. We also observe, on
average, a positive hold to matuirty Sharpe Ratio slope in the U.S.. While the Sharpe

3
Ratio evidence is broadly consistent with the implications of standard models, it should
be noted that these statistics are poorly measured in the data.
Consistent with the implications of the Habits and LRR models, which generate a
rising term structure of dividend risk premia, we develop a regime-switching model
calibrated to the historical sample from the U.S. for recessions and expansions. We
use this model to interpret the implications of dividend strip returns and yields for the
term structure of macroeconomic risk. The population (long sample) dividend strip
risk-premium in the regime-switching model rises with maturity. Further, the term
structure of dividend risk premia is conditionally upward sloping in expansions and
downward sloping in recessions. This model-implication is consistent with the data
features discussed above. The model matches the average upward sloping dividend
risk-premium curve for the U.S., whereas when the recession frequencies are too large
relative to their population value, as is the case for Japan and Europe, the model
generates the zero or negative slope found in the data. This establishes that a model
with a positively sloped dividend risk-premium term structure (as in standard asset
pricing models) matches the conditional and unconditional term structure of dividend
strip risk premia observed in the data.
In our analysis we also focus on buy and hold-to-maturity returns on dividend stripsthese returns are the economic object of interest as they correspond to discount rates
for each dividend strip. Our focus on discount rates is motivated by practitioner oriented evidence discussed in Klein (2018) and Mixon and Onur (2017), who highlight
the fact that these markets are illiquid. Our more comprehensive dataset also includes
expanded information on asset liquidity, specifically bid-ask spreads, unavailable in earlier studies. We show the transaction costs implied by bid-ask spreads are consistent
with the conclusion of these articles that dividend strip markets are highly illiquid.
The bid-ask spread on these contracts is larger than their monthly returns, the focus
of previous studies, across horizons and regions and these contracts have very low liquidity compared to the futures market on the underlying equity index (e.g., S&P 500).
This liquidity difference makes the comparison of the relative returns on the strips and
the index extremely unreliable. Given the lack of liquidity in the strips we focus on
expected hold-to-maturity returns, which we show mitigates the effects of large bid-ask
spreads (i.e., trading costs).
Earlier work has also relied on other assets to provide evidence on the returns of
strips, for example equity options in the case of Binsbergen, Brandt, and Koijen (2012).

4
This approach has drawbacks relative to direct evidence from strips. The options-based
approach provides no evidence on the strip curve past two years, so it relies on comparing the index to the strips to infer the shape of the strip discount rate curve. Boguth,
Carlson, Fisher, and Simutin (2011) and Schulz (2016) show why inference regarding
dividend strips based on options data is suspect due to, respectively, micro-structure
effects and tax issues. These studies, however, also use sample averages for unconditional inference. We show that correctly accounting for the balance of recessions and
expansions makes the data entirely consistent with standard models and that market
illiquidity can be appropriately addressed by focusing on hold-to-maturity expected
returns1 .
Several papers have examined the implications of the term structure of equity return
risk for various models or try to provide equilibrium setup in which the term structure
of divided strip returns is downward sloping. For example, Hasler and Marfe (2016)
examines the implications of recession recovery for the term structure. Ai, Croce,
Diercks, and Li (2018) examine the term structure of equity returns in a productionbased general equilibrium economy, finding that differences in dividend exposure to
shocks across the term structure can explain high short maturity risk premia, even
if consumption risk does not follow this pattern. Notably, both Croce, Lettau, and
Ludvigson (2015) and Belo, Collin-Dufresne, and Goldstein (2015) also find that the
dividend strip and consumption strip risk premium curves need not coincide if dividend
beta to consumption risk changes by horizon. More generally, Hansen (2013), Backus,
Boyarchenko, and Chernov (2017), and Piazzesi, Schneider, and Tuzel (2007) study
implications of various asset pricing models for different cashflow durations.

Equity Yields

This section describes simple fundamental relations about equity prices, dividend yields,
and dividend strip returns. These relations will be informative for our subsequent
empirical analysis. Note that log-transformed variables are indicated with lower case
letters.
1

Existing work, e.g. Weber (2018), studying discount rates and asset duration from the panel of
equities is uninformative on term structure variation in discount rates because it assumes a constant
discount rate between firms and across maturities.

2.1

Equity as a portfolio of dividend strips

Let St denote the price of a claim on all future dividends. Then, St can be written as
St =

∞
X

Pn,t ,

(1)

n=1

where Pn,t is the price of a claim on dividend at time t + n, Dt+n . Such a claim is often
called “dividend strip” or “zero-coupon equity”. We can write Pn,t as
Pn,t = Et [Mt+n Dt+n ] ,

(2)

where Mt+n denotes the stochastic discount factor. The price of this claim tomorrow is
Pn−1,t+1 , noting that both the conditioning information and the time to maturity have
changed. As a result, we can define the one-period return on the dividend strip with
time to maturity n as
Rn,t+1 =

Pn−1,t+1
.
Pn,t

(3)

Note that for n = 1, the dividend strip return is equal to R1,t+1 =

P0,t+1
.
P1,t

The price

of a claim on the current dividend is the value of the dividend itself which implies
P0,t+1 = Dt+1 . For maturities longer than one period, the dividend strip does not have
a payout at t + 1 and, therefore, its return only reflects the change in its price.
Using the no-arbitrage relation, we can always write the return on the asset, Rt+1 , in
terms of its payoff as the sum of tomorrow’s dividend and the value of all the future
strips divided by the purchase price. Therefore, the one-period equity return can be
expressed as a weighted average of dividend strip returns where the weights are given
by the fraction of the corresponding dividend strip value in the total equity value:
Rt+1 =

∞
X
Pn−1,t+1
n=1

St

=

∞
X
Pn,t Pn−1,t+1
n=1

St

Pn,t

=

∞
X
Pn,t
n=1

St

Rn,t+1 =

∞
X

ωn,t Rn,t+1

(4)

n=1

where ωn,t is the weight of the maturity n strip in the portfolio of all strips for the
asset. This equation establishes that the asset return can be viewed as the weighted
average of the strip returns, where the weights are the fraction of the value of the asset
for which each strip accounts.

2.2

Relation to dividend futures

Dividend futures are agreements where, at time t, the buyer and the seller agree on a
contract price of Fn,t which the buyer will pay to the seller at t + n, and will receive the
realized dividend Dt+n in exchange. Hence, the price is agreed upon at t while money
changes hands at t + n. Let yn,t be the time t zero-coupon bond yield with maturity n.
Then, the futures price is given by
Fn,t = Pn,t exp(nyn,t ),

(5)

which can be alternatively written as Pn,t = Fn,t exp(−nyn,t ). The dividend strip return
then becomes the product of the change in the futures price and the return on the bond
with maturity n:
Rn,t+1 =

Fn−1,t+1 exp(−(n − 1)yn−1,t+1 )
.
Fn,t
exp(−nyn,t )

(6)

Using the future price Fn,t and current dividend Dt , it is also instructive to define the
spot equity and forward equity yield for maturity n respectively as:
en,t
efn,t

Hold-to-maturity expected returns

What is the relationship of the strip yield to the expected returns on the strip? Note
that we can always rewrite the strip return to maturity as:
Rt+n =

Dt+n
Dt Dt+n
=
.
Pt,n
Pt,n Dt

(9)

This is the n-period return on the dividend strip with time to maturity n, which relies
on the same expression provided in (3). For notational simplicity, Rt+n is used instead
of Rn,t+n .
Denote the n period average log return on an n period strip as rt+n =
and the n period average dividend growth as gd,t+n =

1
n

1
n

ln(Rt+n )

ln( DDt+n
). Rearranging (9) by
t

7
applying (7) and (8), we can rewrite the return decomposition as:
rt+n = efn,t + yn,t + gd,t+n = en,t + gd,t+n .

(10)

Therefore, the average expected return is
Et [rt+n ] = en,t + Et [gd,t+n ]

(11)

which is the sum of the spot equity yield and the average expected dividend growth
rates
Et [gd,t+n ] =

1
Dt+n 
Et [ln
].
n
Dt

(12)

(11) is referred to as the hold-to-maturity expected return, which is the conditional
discount rate on the strip. Note that en,t is an inflation neutral quantity, so using an
estimate of real growth for Et [gd,t+n ] yields an estimate of real discount rates Et [rt+n ],
which is the economic object of interest. One can also compute the premium on the
hold to maturity expected return by subtracting the real yield by maturity from both
sides of (11)
r
Et [rxt+n ] = Et [rt+n ] − yn,t
.

(13)

We can go further in characterizing the economic informational content of the dividend yields by computing the Sharpe ratio. We can compute the variance of returns
conditional on the time t information set:
Vt [rt+n ] = Vt [gd,t+n ].

(14)

This suggests that the volatility of the contract conditional on time t information is
just the expected dividend growth volatility. This allows us to write the annualized
conditional Sharpe ratio of the strip conditional on the time t information set as:
Et [rxt+n ]
SRn,t = p
.
Vt [gd,t+n ]

(15)

Note that we are not accounting for the half variance term in defining excess returns.

Data

3.1

Data source

Dividend futures prices. The data set covers the period from December 2004 to
February 2017 at daily frequency and is provided from the proprietary data of a major
financial institution that is active in dividend strips markets. The data consists of pricing and liquidity information on dividend futures. Dividend futures contracts typically
mature on or after the third Friday of December in the year they mature. On that
date the buyer of the contract pays the agreed amount at the initiation of the contract
(which we call “the futures price”) and the contract seller pays the realized dividends
of the index in the year of maturity. The data is the internal pricing information used
to trade in these markets by the providing institution and the data delivered to us by
the institution contains MID prices for the entire sample and BID and ASK prices for
a slightly shorter sample - starting in July 2008 for the Eurostoxx, in June 2010 for
the Nikkei, and in January 2010 for the S&P 500. The main data set that is used to
calculate equity yields and returns corresponds to MID prices on the last trading day
of the month.
Daily exchange traded volume and open interest are available for Eurostoxx and
Nikkei for the same period as BID and ASK prices are available2 . We also show that for
the overlapping periods our data is consistent with that used in Binsbergen, Hueskes,
Koijen, and Vrugt (2013) and Binsbergen and Koijen (2017) in terms of descriptive
statistics. The S&P 500 contracts are only traded over the counter (OTC) and no
comparable public data is available for the spreads on these contracts. Practitioner
oriented work in Mixon and Onur (2017) provides data on the volume traded and
contracts outstanding in the OTC portions of each market that shows qualitatively
consistent evidence on the liquidity of these markets. Section 6 discusses the liquidity
data for these markets in detail.
The data set is short (146 months) and it is more practical to analyze the behavior
of fixed maturity contracts at monthly frequency. Therefore, we linearly interpolate
between futures prices to obtain a finer grid of maturities. For example, we would
like to track the futures price with maturity n = 24 months. At the end of July 2007,
2

For much of the post-2010 period data on exchange traded volume, open interest, BID, and ASK
prices are also available daily via Bloomberg as well for the Eurostoxx and Nikkei, although we use
the institution provided data throughout.

9
however, we have contracts with maturities of 5, 17, 29, 41, ... months. To obtain a price
for the 24-month contract, we linearly interpolate between F17,t and F29,t , similar to the
process used in Binsbergen, Hueskes, Koijen, and Vrugt (2013).3 When we compute
holding period returns we interpolate between the returns themselves, thus obtaining a
portfolio return for a portfolio with the same average maturity as the desired contract.
This makes our estimates of holding period returns, particularly spread adjusted returns,
achievable portfolio returns as in Binsbergen and Koijen (2016).
Zero-coupon bond yields. As can be seen from (6), the calculation of a monthly
return on a 12-month dividend strip requires availability of both futures prices, as well
as zero-coupon bond yields with maturities at monthly frequency. In order to ensure a
consistent methodology is used in constructing the zero coupon interest rate curve we
use the Bloomberg zero curve estimates for all three regions, for the dollar, yen, and
for euro-denominated German sovereigns. To extend the data further back than these
estimates exist, we use the bond yield data from Gürkaynak, Sack, and Wright (2007)
available on FED’s website. We obtain maturities at monthly frequency by linearly
interpolating between available yields.
Dividend growth rates. We measure realized dividends from index returns. We use
realized dividend data to construct dividend growth series starting in December 1979
for the U.S. and December 1994 for Europe and Japan, where the extended sample is
reduced due to data availability. We provide the time series of the annualized dividend
growth rates in the appendix as Figure A-2 for each region.
Recession frequency. Our most dramatic finding in the data is the stark and robust
variation of return and growth term structures across the business cycle. Importantly,
we do not use recession or expansion state in forecasting but simply to subsample
forecasts and data to emphasize cyclical variation. To identify business cycles we use
the NBER recession dates for the U.S., the CEPR recession dates for Europe, and
recession dates from the Economic Cycle Research Institute for Japan4 . Substantial
variation in slope across the cycle means that the frequency of recessions in a given
short sample can substantially affect the sample mean of the slope. We document that
in the sample with strips data, 2005-2017, the frequency of recessions is 12% in the U.S.,
3

We emphasize that our results are robust to yield interpolation instead of price interpolation
method.
4
The Economic Cycle Research Institute estimates peak-to-trough recession dates for a variety of
countries. We have confirmed that the recessions dated by this provider for the U.S. and Europe match
those dated by the NBER and CEPR and that they track the cyclical behavior of GDP.

t
Notes: Equity yields are constructed by efn,t = n1 ln( FDn,t
) with Fn,t the futures price and Dt the
trailing sum of 12 month dividends. We provide the subsample average and standard deviation of
the forward equity yields from 2004:M12 to 2017:M2 for the three markets, i.e., S&P 500, Eurostoxx
50, and Nikkei 225. We partition the sample into “expansion periods,” and “recession periods.” For
US, NBER recession dates are 1980:M1-1980:M7, 1981:M7-1982:M11, 1990:M7-1991:M3, 2001:M32001:M11, 2007:M12-2009:M6. For Europe, CEPR recession dates are 2008:Q1-2009:Q2, 2011:Q32013:Q1. For Japan, recession dates are 1998:M6-1998:M11, 2001:M9-2002:M5, 2008:M9-2009:M8,
2011:M3-2013:M2, 2014:M9-2015:M2. t-statistics are based on Newey-West standard errors. Maturities
are in annual units.

26% in Europe, and 36% in Japan. For the U.S., this is relatively close to the long run
recession frequency since 1950 of 14%, but it is nearly double the rate for Europe, which
was 13% in the long run, and Japan, which was 19%. This strongly suggests that the
behavior of any cyclical slopes in Europe and Japan will be substantially biased towards
their recession means in the data. We address this formally in a model in Section 5, but
emphasize the recession and expansion subsample means throughout our exposition of
the data evidence to reinforce the importance of recession frequency.

3.2

The stylized facts about equity yields and dividends

Table 1 provides the summary statistics of the forward equity yields in these three
markets from 2004 to 2017. We first look at the average term structure of equity yields.

11
We find that only the U.S. market seems to show the evidence of upward sloping term
structure of equity yields whereas the European and Japanese markets exhibit mildly
downward sloping term structure of equity yields.
We then highlight the behavior of equity yields conditional on the state of business
cycle, i.e., expansion and recession. There is remarkable consistency across these three
markets. We find that the term structure of equity yields is upward (downward) sloping
in expansion (recession) in all three markets. The absolute magnitude of the spread
between 5-year and 1-year maturity equity yields tends to be much larger during recession than expansion.5 One can easily deduce from this finding that the unconditional
(sample) average of the term structure of equity yields heavily depends on the frequency
of recession in the sample.
We will ultimately use a longer sample in forecasting dividend growth rates so that
we can conduct real time out-of-sample forecasting, so we present results for both this
extended sample and the subsample with strip data. The extended sample begins in
1979 for the U.S. and 1994 for Europe and Japan, due to data availability. Figure A2 provides the time series of the realized dividend growth rates conditional on the
state of the business cycle for the three markets. Note that there were no recessions
identified by CEPR in Europe from 1994-2005. We emphasize first that the frequency
of recessions in Europe and Japan after 2005 is greater than that in the longer sample,
while it is comparable for both samples in the U.S., and second that the behavior of
expected dividend growth rates, as documented below, is different in recessions and
expansions. Given the behavior of the strip yields in Table 1, this implies that the
sample average behavior if the various term structure slopes will be tilted towards thair
recession outcomes in Europe and Japan.

4

Forecasting Dividend Growth Rates

We expect that the dynamics of expected dividend growth rates, and consequently,
expected returns, see (11), would be quite different conditional on recession and expansion. To show this, we develop a model for forecasting dividend growth rates both in
sample and out-of-sample, as discussed below.
5

The downward sloping pattern of the term structure is most notable during the Great Recession,
see Figure A-1.

12

4.1

VAR-based dividend forecasts

Let xA,t be a vector of monthly variables that predicts dividend growth. We consider
an annual first order VAR dynamics for the predictor vector
xA,t+12 = µA + ΓA xA,t + εA,t+12 .

(16)

This is because we are interested in the annual horizon forecasts. There are two ways
of estimating the coefficients in (16): The first is via the direct projection method and

Bayesian inference

The sample in which we have equity yields is quite short. However, data on dividend
growth rates are available much before. We have seen from Figure A-2 that we can
potentially rely on the historical data to learn about the future dividend growth dynamics to the extent that dynamics have not changed substantially over time. In this
section, we formally show how one could optimally use prior information (extracted
from historical data) and improve forecasts.

Since we are mainly interested in the conditional expectation, we omit the expression for Σ. The
readers are referred to Giannone, Lenza, and Primiceri (2015).

14
The elicitation of prior. Suppose that we can divide the sample into the pre-sample,
estimation sample, and prediction sample. We set the prior mean Φ equal to the
pre-sample OLS estimate, from the 1980-2004 sample for the U.S. and the 1995-2004
sample for Europe and Japan. Here, prior becomes more informative when ξ → 0. In
the limit, posterior equals the pre-sample OLS estimate, i.e., prior. In contrast, when
ξ = ∞, then it is easy to see that Φ = Φ̂ = (X 0 X)−1 (X 0 Y ), i.e., an OLS estimate from
the estimation sample. In this case, prior does not play any role. We can optimize
the scaling parameter by choosing the value that maximizes the marginal likelihood
function, ξˆ = argmax p(Y |ξ). The closed form of the marginal likelihood function is
available in the appendix. We refer to Giannone, Lenza, and Primiceri (2015) for a
detailed discussion.

4.3

Model selection and estimation

The VAR expression in (19) can describe the approach of Binsbergen, Hueskes, Koijen,
and Vrugt (2013) where the predictor vector xA comprises the 2-year and 5-year forward
equity yields. We refer to this three-variable (dividend growth plus two predictors)
VAR, identical to that of BHKV, as the Short Sample Predictor (SSP) approach for
simplicity. We propose a different three-variable VAR where the predictor vector xA
comprises the 5y-1y nominal bond yield spread and dividend to earnings ratio, which
is referred to as the Long Sample Predictor (LSP) approach. In addition to improved
forecast accuracy, the LSP will allow us to conduct out-of-sample forecasting because
these predictors have a longer history than dividend yields.
Ideally, we would like to conduct both in-sample and out-of-sample forecast exercises
for the SSP and LSP approaches. Unfortunately, we cannot conduct out-of-sample
forecast exercise for the SSP approach since their predictor variables, the 2-year and
5-year forward equity yields, are only available from 2004:M12 according to our data
vendor. The VAR coefficients in the SSP approach cannot be recursively estimated
unless the prediction sample is substantially shortened. This is not ideal given the
data availability. The reason we desire to use recursive updating and out-of-sample
forecasting using the LSP is to establish that our results hold in real-time forecasts.
This study is the first to show the term structure of expected growth and returns in
real time.

15
To minimize confusion, we define two estimation strategies. The in-sample estimation is carried out with data from 2004:M12 to 2017:M2 using the maximum available
data. We can formally conduct model selection and compare the in-sample forecasting
performance of the SSP and LSP approaches. When we generate in-sample forecasts,
we allow for look-ahead bias by including all the data in the estimation at once. Here,
we briefly describe the model selection result. The forecast results are discussed shortly.
We choose the LSP approach over the SSP approach based on the model selection via
the marginal likelihood maximization. For U.S., the log marginal likelihood values are
430 versus 374; for Europe, they are 704.4 versus 58.5; for Japan, 596 versus 135, all in
favor of LSP over SSP approach.
To define the out-of-sample estimation period, we first set the prediction sample
to 2005:M1 to 2013:M2. The initial out-of-sample estimation starts from 2001:M1 to
2004:M12. When we move the forecast origin from 2005:M1 to 2013:M2, the posterior
VAR coefficients are also updated as we recursively increase the sample. In doing so,
we optimize the scaling parameter ξ that controls the tightness of the prior.
With respect to prior information, we use the sample before the prediction sample
to obtain prior for the VAR coefficients. Specifically, we use data from 1979:M12 to
2000:M12 (U.S.) and from 1994:M12 to 2000:M12 (Europe and Japan) to elicit prior
information. It is possible for the LSP approach because the 5y-1y nominal bond yield
spread and dividend to earnings ratio are available. Since elicitation of prior information
is not possible for the SSP approach, we set the scaling parameter to ξ = ∞ so that
(whichever specified) prior does not play any role and the posterior mean is identical to
the OLS estimate. Thus, we can rely on the same expression (24) to generate posterior
forecasts for both the SSP and LSP approaches.

Forecast results

The dividend growth rate forecasts are generated up to 5-year-out to maximize the
data availability.8 Table 2 summarizes the root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of the
dividend growth rate forecasts for the three markets. Let us focus on Panel A: U.S. and
compare the RMSEs from the out-of-sample LSP (o.o.s.) with those from the in-sample
SSP approach. The results are surprising given that the LSP approach (o.o.s.) is at
8

One could generate upto 7-year-out horizon which results in shortening the prediction sample to
2005:M1-2011:M2 instead of 2005:M1-2013:M2.

Notes: For the in-sample forecasts, we use data from 1979:M12 to 2004:M12 (U.S.) and from 1994:M12
to 2004:M12 (Europe and Japan) to elicit prior information. The estimation sample is from 2005:M1
to 2017:M2. Our prediction sample is from 2005:M1 to 2013:M2. For the out-of-sample forecasts, we
use data from 1979:M12 to 2000:M12 (U.S.) and from 1994:M12 to 2000:M12 (Europe and Japan) to
elicit prior information. The initial estimation sample is from 2001:M1 to 2004:M12. We increase the
estimation sample recursively as we move the forecast origin. The root mean squared errors based on
the out-of-sample forecasts are indicated with o.o.s.

a clear informational disadvantage compared with the SSP approach. Except at the
1-year horizon, we find that the RMSEs for the respective horizons are much smaller
than those from the SSP approach. What is interesting is the magnitude of the RMSEs,
whether they are based on in-sample or out-of-sample forecasts, are similar for the LSP
approach. This evidence strongly suggests the superior forecast performance of our
VAR approach and the usefulness of extracting information embedded in the historical
data in the form of priors.
The RMSEs from the out-of-sample forecasts are uniformly larger (roughly by a factor
of two) than those of the in-sample SSP forecasts for Europe and Japan. Again, the
large RMSE and apparent changes in dividend dynamics relative to the pre-sample
suggests that these dividend growth events were unexpected. For in sample forecasts,
our model continues to produce superior estimates to those of Binsbergen, Hueskes,
Koijen, and Vrugt (2013) and dominates in marginal likelihood.
Once the expected dividend growth rates are generated, given the forward equity
yields and real rates, we are able to compute the expected return (see (11)), excess
return (see (13)), and hold to maturity Sharpe Ratio (see (15)) as well. We construct
the real rate proxy by subtracting the average inflation from the nominal yields.9 To
9
Given the relatively small variation of inflation rates, especially relative to the large movements in
real growth and discount rates, by horizon within the recession and expansion subsamples, it is highly

Table 3 provides the annualized average expected dividend growth rates Et [gt+n ]
(“Exp. growth”); the expected discount rate Et [rt+n ] (“Exp. return”); the expected excess return Et rxt+n (“Premium”); the Sharpe ratio SRn,t (“Sharpe ratio”); the forward
equity yields efn,t (“STRIPS”); and the nominal bond yields yn,t (“YLD”). We provide
the corresponding averages of the entire prediction sample and the averages conditional
on whether the forward equity yield spread between 5-year and 1-year is positive or
negative. This is because we believe that the negative spread of forward equity yields
between 5-year and 1-year closely tracks the recession dates.10 Remember that these
are the averages of real time out-of-sample forecasts. We provide the evidence for the
remaining regions in the appendix. We refrain from using the recession indicators to
forecast as they are determined ex post. On the other hand, the equity yields and LSP
predictors are available to investors in real time.
We summarize the main findings as follows. The slope of the expected dividend growth
is negative (positive) during expansions (recessions). The slopes of the expected return,
excess return, and sharpe ratio are positive (negative) during expansion (recession).
The slopes of the entire period averages of expected return, expected excess return,
and sharpe ratio are positive. Both the in and out-of-sample hold to maturity Sharpe
Ratios are either upward-sloping (U.S. and Japan) or flat (Europe in sample), however
these statistics have large standard errors relative to risk premium estimates. To check
the statistical significance of the findings, Table 4 provides the 90% credible intervals
associated with the selective forecasts: expected return and growth. It is interesting to
observe that all slopes of the conditional moments are statistically significantly different
from zero at the 90% confidence level. The findings are largely robust to the out-ofsample and in-sample forecast results. The in-sample forecast results based on the SSP
approach deliver qualitatively similar message, which is provided in Table A-5. Finally,
we note that while the estimates of hold to maturity Sharpe Ratios are substantially
noisier, the Sharpe Ratio slope is significantly positive in the U.S., where the estimates
are best and the recession frequency is in line with the long run mean, at 0.39 for 5y-1y
in sample and 0.51 out-of-sample.
We find that the sign of the conditional slopes for the European and Japanese markets
are broadly consistent with the U.S. market with expected returns sloping downward in
10
Figure A-3 plots the two series, which appear to be highly correlated. The correlation between the
equity yield spread and recession indicator is around 65% for the U.S. and Europe and 40% for Japan,
respectively. The seemingly low correlation than it appears is because we are computing correlation
with a dummary variable.

Notes: We provide the results based on the in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts for Et [gd,t+5 −gd,t+1 ]
and Et [rt+5 − rt+1 ] computed as in (11): Et [rt+n ] = en,t + Et [gd,t+n ]. For the in-sample forecasts, we
use data from 1979:M12 to 2004:M12 (U.S.) and from 1994:M12 to 2004:M12 (Europe and Japan) to
elicit prior information. The estimation sample is from 2005:M1 to 2017:M2. Our prediction sample is
from 2005:M1 to 2013:M2. For the out-of-sample forecasts, we use data from 1979:M12 to 2000:M12
(U.S.) and from 1994:M12 to 2000:M12 (Europe and Japan) to elicit prior information. The initial
estimation sample is from 2001:M1 to 2004:M12. We increase the estimation sample recursively as we

recession and upward in booms. Caution is required in interpreting the sample average
as an unconditional mean because the balance of recessions in the short sample is not
representative for these regions. If the sample overrepresents recessions, as is the case
in Europe and Japan, the behavior of the sample average expected growth and dividend
discount rate slopes will be biased towards their recession means.
We have shown that the most robust feature of this data is the recession and expansion variation of the growth rate and risk premium term structures. Due to the large
differences between recessions and expansions, we develop a regime-switching model in
the next section that preserves the core implications of standard asset pricing models risk unconditionally increases with horizon, both risk and expected growth vary across
the cycle, and the riskfree rate is nearly constant - while matching the conditional facts
on expected growth and risk premia we document via the BVAR. This model allows
us to formally address issues of short sample biases and recession-expansion balance in
context and show that both the conditional and sample average facts documented in

20
this section are wholly consistent with standard models like the LRR or habits.

5

The regime-switching model

Motivated by the empirical findings, we introduce a regime-switching consumptionbased asset pricing model to understand its implications for both the conditional and
unconditional moments.

5.1

Cash flow dynamics

The joint dynamics of monthly consumption and dividend growth are
ηc,t ∼ N (0, 1),

∆ct = µ(St ) + xt + σc ηc,t ,

∆dt = µ̄ + φ(∆ct − µ̄) + σd ηd,t ,

(25)

ηd,t ∼ N (0, 1),

xt = ρxt−1 + σx (St )t ,
where µ̄ is the unconditional mean of consumption growth, xt is the persistent component of consumption growth, and St is a discrete Markov state variable that takes
on two values St ∈ {1, 2}. We assume µ1 > µ2 without loss of generality and indicate
St = 1 an expansion state and St = 2 a recession state.
The model-implied average expected dividend growth is

(27)

It is easy to understand from (26) that the path of Et [gd,t+n ] significantly depends on
the current state St . To provide a preview, the slope of the expected dividend growth
is negative (positive) if the economy is in expansion (recession). This is illustrated in

21
Figure 1. Later, we argue that the model characterizes an important aspect of the data
especially when it comes to the short-horizon forecasts.

5.2

Stochastic discount factor

We assume that the log stochastic discount factor (SDF) follows
1
mt+1 = −rt+1 − λ(St+1 )2 − λ(St+1 )t+1
2

(28)

with an exogenously specified risk-free rate, rt+1 . We set rt+1 = r̄ so that the riskfree rate does not depend on the state. The market price of risk depends on the state
λ(St+1 ). We impose that λ(1) < λ(2) in the spirit of Campbell and Cochrane (1999),
e.g., higher risk aversion in bad times. Since µ1 > µ2 , this allows us to match the
recession and expansion dynamics of both returns and growth while preserving the
implications of standard models. In both Habits and LRR, short term risk goes up in
bad states then gradually comes down over time, generating the conditional features
we have explicitly modeled in this regime-switching model in a simpler implementation.
Along with capturing expected growth variation in a convenient way that is consistent
with the data, an improvement relative to standard calibrations, this will also allow us
to match the conditional yield and dividend discount rate slopes.

5.3

Price to dividend ratio of the zero-coupon equity

The price of zero-coupon equity is Pn,t = Zn,t Dt . In the economy of (25) with the SDF of
(28), we can conjecture that the log price to dividend ratio of the zero-coupon equity zn,t
depends on the regime and persistent growth component, i.e., zn,t = zn,0 (St )+zn,1 (St )xt .

Exploiting the law of iterated expectations, we can solve for zn,t = ln E E exp(mt+1 +
 
zn−1,t+1 + ∆dt+1 )|St+1 |St . The detailed derivation is provided in the appendix.

5.4

The model-implied term structure of equity risk premia

We calibrate the model to match the U.S. data moments for consumption and dividend
growth rates and market equity premium. The calibrated parameters for consumption
growth are standard (the expansion state is associated with higher mean and lower
volatility).
The conditional moments. Note that the conditional moments will be function
of consumption growth component xt and the regime (discrete state) St . For ease of
illustrating the model implications, we set xt = 0 for simplicity and highlight the role of
regime St .11 Panel A of Figure 1 provides the model-implied (7), (11), (12), and (13).
We summarize the model implications as follow:
1. The slope of the expected dividend growth is negative (positive) if the economy
is in expansion (recession).12
2. The slope of the term structure of the riskfree rate is zero (by construction).
3. The slope of the equity yields, dividend discount rates, and dividend risk premia
is positive (negative) if the economy is in expansion (recession).
11

This means that the risk associated with xt is priced, but we assume that the realization is xt = 0
for graphical illustration.
12
One thing to emphasize is that the expected dividend growth rate is much lower in recession even
though we calibrated µ2 = 1.2% (annualized). What matters is whether the current economic state is
below the long-run mean µ̄ or not.

23
We match the key conditional expected growth rate and dividend discount rate slope
features documented in the data in Tables 1 and 4. We also calibrate the regime
transition probabilities to match the long run frequency of recessions across regions about 15%.
The population moments. Panel B of Figure 1 provides the population unconditional moments of the term structure of the equity risk premia and expected growth
in the model. The model generates unconditional term structure of discount rate and
equity risk premia in which both macroeconomic and dividend risk rises with horizon. Empirically speaking, the unconditional price and return moments can be hard to
measure, since they involve calculating the unconditional probabilities of the state of
the business cycle. The results depend on the sample over which the probabilities are
calculated. The small sample bias is especially relevant in this context. For example,
if recessions are overrepresented in the sample, then the sample average moments of
prices and returns would be biased towards those in the recession state. Hence, there
is substantial risk of misinterpreting the results if sample averages are used to estimate
unconditional means without attention to the frequency of recessions.
To show this, we average the conditional moments implied from the model across the
two states with recession frequency that is different from the steady state probability
of recession, which is around 15%. We proceed with three cases of recession frequency
based on the realized short sample recession frequencies in the three regions of 12%,
26%, and 35% of the sample from 2005:M1 to 2013:M2 for the U.S., Europe, and Japan,
respectively. We use the prediction sample to estimate the recession probabilities. Panel
C of Figure 1 provides the small-sample averages of the term structure of the equity risk
premia and expected growth among others based on three cases of recession frequency.
One could clearly observe the pattern of downward sloping term structure of discount
rate and equity risk premia when recession frequency is much greater than the model
steady-state recession frequency, as is the case in Europe and Japan in the data. If the
small sample recession frequency is below the model steady state recession probability,
then the term structure of discount rate and equity risk premia are strongly upward
sloping, as is the case in the U.S. in the data.
Figure 2 pursues this idea more formally. We simulate the time series of economic
state (recession and expansion) from the model that matches the length of our prediction
sample, which is roughly eight years (T = 96 months). Conditional on the economic
state at each time t, we pick the corresponding moments of expected return for the

and repeat the simulation N =10,000 times. Thus, we have a panel N × T of the model-implied slope
of expected return. We compute the average probability of recession for each time series. We then
sort this N dimensional vector of recession probability from low to high. Starting from low to high
recession probability, we report the sample average slope of expected return (first panel). We also test
the null hypothesis that the slope of expected return is zero (second panel). In the data, the recession
periods were 12%, 26%, 35% of the sample from 2005:M1 to 2013:M2 for the U.S., Europe, and Japan,

entire maturity from Panel A of Figure 1. We repeat the exercise by N = 10, 000 times
to provide variation in the realization of recession states. Thus, we have an N × T panel
of the model-implied slope of expected return. Next, we compute the realized recession
frequency for each simulated time series and sort the set of time series on the realized
frequency. Starting from low to high recession probability, we report the sample average
slope of expected return (first panel). We also test the null hypothesis that the slope of
expected return is zero (second panel). Since the risk-free rate is constant in the model,
this is equivalent to testing the slope of equity risk premia.
We cannot reject the null hypothesis, i.e., slope is zero, if recession frequencies are
around 19%-33%. In this range, the corresponding p-values are greater than 10% at
least. Once the recession frequency falls below 19%, the p-value approaches zero and
the model-implied slope of expected return is statistically strongly positive. In contrast,
if recession frequency is greater than 33%, the opposite is true. In the data, we find
that the recession periods were 12%, 26%, 35% of the sample from 2005:M1 to 2013:M2
for the U.S., Europe, and Japan, respectively. From the perspective of our model,
only the U.S. seems to show the evidence of upward-sloping term structure of expected
return (discount rate) which is statistically significant. On the opposite end of the

26
spectrum, Japan shows the evidence of downward-sloping term structure of expected
return, which is statistically significant both in the model and the data. Despite the
statistical significance of the slope, this is a poor estimate of the unconditional mean,
which helps to rationalize the sample average slopes we observe in the data. Further, the
model’s prediction is qualitatively consistent with the forecasts of the slope of expected
returns (the sample average) in Table 4 across regions.13

5.6

Summary of the model

We introduced a standard no-arbitrage model extended with regime-switching growth
dynamics, which inherits key features of the leading asset pricing models (e.g., long-run
risks and habit formation models). The regime-switching growth dynamics produce
conditional dynamics of expected growth and dividend discount rates consistent with
data documented via the BVAR. The model generates unconditional discount rate term
structures in which risk rises with horizon. We also show that, in spite of the unconditional upward slope, in finite samples the sample average dividend discount rate term
structure can slope down when recessions are overrepresented, a key feature of the data.
The model matches both the conditional and sample average slopes across regions when
the recession frequenies match in the small sample. Based on these results we conclude
that the implications of the Habits and Long Run Risks models are entirely consistent
with the strip data. This is in direct contrast to the conclusions drawn by Binsbergen and Koijen (2017), among others, who rely directly on sample averages of monthly
holding period returns as estimates of the unconditional term structure.

6

Illiquidity and Holding Period Returns

Some of the literature on dividend strips relies on monthly holding period returns at
the mid of bid and ask prices to estimate the term structure of dividend discount rates.
We show that monthly dividend strip holding period returns are poorly measured,
highly sensitive to spreads, and are smaller than average spreads almost universally.
Based on these returns there are two claims (see Binsbergen and Koijen (2017)) - that
the holding period returns decline with maturity and are below the index (implying a

The forecast of slope of expected dividend growth rates turns out to be statistically insignificant
for all regions. Thus, we do not attempt to compare with the model counterpart.

27
downward slope) and that Sharpe Ratios follow a similar pattern. In Table 5, below, we
replicate this evidence for our dataset and show that these returns are measured with
large standard errors at mid prices. More importantly, we show that holding period
returns are contaminated by severe illiquidity as reflected in large bid-ask spreads.
Indeed, spreads are larger than monthly returns, making these holding period returns
unreliable for measuring the underlying discount rates of economic interest.

6.1

Holding period returns at mid prices

First, we reproduce the evidence on mean holding period returns at mid prices, the focus
of earlier work. We examine whether the index is above or crosses the term structure of
dividend strip returns and Sharpe Ratios and whether returns Sharpe Ratios rise with
maturity. Table 5 displays the point estimates for returns in excess of the index and
strip Sharpe Ratios for the S&P 500, Eurostoxx, and Nikkei. Table 5 shows that there
is no significant difference between index and strip returns, even if the point estimates
of dividend strip returns are below the monthly index for the S&P 500 but are above the
monthly index for Nikkei and Eurostoxx. Strip returns slope up in the U.S. and Japan
and down in Europe, a fact which is again insignificant. Finally, there are no significant
differences in Sharpe Ratio, although the point estimates slope up and are below the
index in the U.S. and slope down and are above the index elsewhere. As emphasized by
Cochrane (2017), there is no reliable inference to be drawn from monthly holding period
returns at mid prices because they are both poorly measured and have a short sample.
The fact that average spreads are universally larger than returns in these markets casts
a deeper pall on the reliability of the holding period return evidence, as we discuss next.

6.2

Illiquidity and the level of returns

Recent work by Mixon and Onur (2017), who document the illiquidity of the strip
market and its causes, and analysis in news media, e.g., Klein (2018), both suggest
that these markets are highly illiquid and are dominated by liability hedging at long
horizons. Motivated by these studies and the avilability of our novel dataset of spreads
for the OTC S&P 500 strip market we directly examine the implications of spreads in
these markets for mean holding period and hold to maturity returns and Sharpe Ratios.
Note that our bid-ask data are the spread faced by a large financial institution trading

horizon are particularly large outside the U.S., increasing by a factor of between 3 and
8 for spread mean and 2.5-9 for spread volatility, from 1 to 5 years. Note that strongly
increasing spreads and spread volatility with horizon will particularly contaminate evidence comparing the long and short end of the term structures of expected returns and
Sharpe Ratios.
Importantly, bid-ask spread means are dramatically larger than monthly strip returns
at all horizons, and spread variance is on the same order of magnitude as return variance for most markets at all but the shortest horizons. Further, all of these markets
are substantially less liquid than the counterpart markets for short run index futures
on the same indexes14 . Liquidity differences contaminate comparisons both between
markets and across maturities. Drawing conclusions on relative index and strip returns and Sharpe Ratios in the presence of such large illiquidity is highly unreliable. In
comparison, index returns are relatively well measured, even accounting for spreads.

The illiquidity in longer dated contracts makes it difficult to justify drawing strong
conclusions about the relative economic risk of dividend strips by horizon based on the
monthly holding period return data. To show why, we estimate what the actual return
would be if one were to buy the dividend strip at the ask and sell at the bid on a monthly
basis. We present the results of this analysis in Table 7. Note that the bid-ask adjusted
returns at the monthly horizon are negative for all three markets, and massively so
for the longer maturity contracts. All of these achievable returns are well below the
returns on the asset. Given that transaction costs swamp the returns at short holding
horizons, the marginal investor in these contracts is unlikely to evaluate the contract
at these horizons and therefore the economic information about their discount rates is
not reflected in the monthly return information.15
One way to mitigate the impact of large transaction costs is to increase the holding
period. However, we find that increasing the holding period to 12 months does not
resolve these issues at any but the shortest maturities. The discrepancy between returns
and returns net of transaction costs is still on the same order of magnitude as the mean
return in all three markets. For longer maturity contracts it is still difficult to justify
the assumption that the marginal investor intends to give up between 30% and all of
the return on the contract by trading it at a 1 year horizon.
Mixon and Onur (2017) reinforce the view that these markets are highly illiquid using
trading volume and open interest information. They show that across exchanges and
OTC markets, dividend futures trade in markets orders of magnitude smaller than their
associated index futures, both in terms of notional and contracts outstanding.16 .. Both
Mixon and Onur (2017) and Klein (2018) indicate that the issuers of structured notes
are long these products to reduce their exposure to dividends. This suggests buy and
hold liability hedging could be driving a considerable volume of trade.
Given the bid-ask spreads and Mixon and Onur (2017)’s evidence, we mitigate the
effects of illiquidity consistent with contracts held by hold to maturity investors. These
investors would buy the contract at the ask price then receive the dividend growth at
15

Investors may implement trading strategies that mitigate the impact of spreads but nevertheless
these spreads reflect the considerable transaction costs that any investor would face.
16
For instance, the Eurostoxx dividend futures market, the largest strip market, is less than 10%
the size of the associated index futures market by notional. In addition Klein (2018) claims that U.S.
domiciled traders could not invest in Eurostoxx markets until 2017. Note that Mixon and Onur (2017)’s
data is exclusively from 2015, when this market was relatively mature compared to the majority of
the sample period, thus the liquidity of these markets was likely substantially smaller for most of the
sample for which we have strip data.

maturity. This strategy accurately reflects the returns achievable by investors while
mitigating the impact of transaction costs to the greatest extent possible. We report
the hold to maturity expected returns, averaged over the sample with bid-ask data
using the purchase price as the last price and the ask price in the last two lines of
each panel of Table 7. Within the sample for which spreads are available, spread
adjusted expected returns also reflect the same qualitative and quantitative patterns
as the expected returns unadjusted for transaction costs. Further, the level effect of
transaction costs is small, consistent with the evidence presented and referenced above.

32
This suggests that the economic information contained in the strip yields, which strongly
supports the leading asset pricing models, is substantially more robust to the liquidity
issues in these markets than is the short horizon holding period return-based evidence.
Once we have corrected for the dramatic illiquidity of the dividend futures markets
and the substantial variation in liquidity by horizon, the data continue to provide strong
support for the implications of standard asset pricing models of short horizon dividend
claims carrying less macroeconomic risk than long horizon claims. There is no reliable
evidence supporting the existing claims of the literature because monthly holding period
returns are both too poorly measured too illiquid to be useful for inference. Short
holding period return estimates are so heavily contaminated by spread and spread
volatility that it is difficult to justify drawing economic conclusions about dividend
risk, as opposed to microstructure and trading risk, from these realized returns.

Conclusion

Using additional asset prices to learn about risk and reward in financial markets is
a welcomed endeavor. At the same time as more esoteric markets are analyzed, any
inference has to be judicious and with an eye to institutional features of such markets
and the limitations of the data. Recently, several papers suggest that the term structure
of dividend strip returns is downward sloping and thus poses a challenge to existing
asset pricing models. In this paper we show that the term structure of dividend strip
risk premia and discount rates implied by equity strip yields is downward sloping in
recessions and upward sloping in expansion periods, a finding which is statistically
significant and robust across regions, in and out of sample estimation, and predictive
models. We also show that the frequency of recessions in the very short sample for
which strips data is available is much higher than the long run recession frequency in
both Europe and Japan.
We develop a regime-switching model that is consistent with the implication of leading models that the unconditional risk premium term structure slopes upwards and
also matches the recession and expansion slopes of expected growth and returns. We
show that when recessions are in line with the long run frequency in a short sample the
discount rate term structure will be upward sloping, but when recessions are overrepresented the slope can be flat or negative as we see in the data for Europe and Japan. The

33
regime switching model shows that the discount rate term structure evidence from dividend strips is consistent both conditionally and unconditionally with the implications
of leading asset pricing models like habits or LRR.
Finally, we show that dividend discount rates, the object of economic interest, are also
the preferred focus for statistical and institutional reasons. First, holding period returns
on the strips do not provide statistically significant evidence for or against any model,
either via the term structure slope or comparisons against the asset return. Second,
holding period returns are contaminated by the dramatic illiquidity of dividend strip
markets, where average trading costs, bid ask spreads, are larger than monthly returns.
Finally, we show that discount rates and their associated evidence are robust to these
issues. In totality, we find strong evidence that all the robust features of the strip
evidence are both conditionally and unconditionally consistent with the implications of
leading asset pricing models.

Bayesian Linear Regression

Without loss of generality, we can express any linear dynamics by
yt = Φxt + εt ,

εt ∼ N (0, Σ).

(A-1)

For ease of exposition, define Y = [yp , ..., yT ]0 , X = [xp , ..., xT ]0 , and ε = [εp , ..., εT ]0 .
Assume that the initial p observations are available. Because of the conjugacy if the
prior is

Φ|Σ ∼ M N Φ, Σ ⊗ (V Φ ξ) ,

Σ ∼ IW (Ψ, d)

(A-2)


then the posterior can be expressed as Φ|Σ ∼ M N Φ, Σ ⊗ V Φ where

.

We follow the exposition in Giannone, Lenza, and Primiceri (2015). ξ is a scalar parameter controlling the tightness of the prior information. For instance, prior becomes
more informative when ξ → 0. In contrast, when ξ = ∞, then it is easy to see that
Φ = Φ̂, i.e., an OLS estimate. We can choose ξ that maximizes the marginal likelihood
function (A-3), which is available in closed form

Solving the Regime-Switching Model

This section provides approximate analytical solutions for the asset prices.

Exogenous dynamics

The joint dynamics of consumption and dividend growth are
ηc,t+1 ∼ N (0, 1),

∆ct+1 = µ(St+1 ) + xt+1 + σc ηc,t+1 ,

∆dt+1 = µ̄ + φ(∆ct+1 − µ̄) + σd ηd,t+1 ,

(A-4)

ηd,t+1 ∼ N (0, 1),

xt+1 = ρxt + σx (St+1 )t+1 ,
where µ̄ is the unconditional mean of consumption growth and xt is the persistent
component of consumption growth. Agents observe the current regime, St , and make
forecast of future regime, St+1 , based on the transition matrix below

Calibration

With this calibration, we derive the market return via Campbell-Shiller approximation
and compute the expected excess return of the market. The equity premium is 4.13 and
18.60 in expansion and recession, respectively. The unconditional average (weighted by
steady state probability) is around 6.29.

Notes: For US, dividend growth data are available from 1979:M12 to 2017:M2 for all horizons. For
Europe, dividend growth data are available from 1994:M12 to 2017:M2 for all horizons. For Japan,
1-year dividend growth data are available starting from 1994:M12, 3-year dividend growth data from
1996:M5, and 5-year dividend growth from 1998:M5. Data end in 2017:M2. Shaded bars indicate
recession dates. The provider for the recession dates is the Economic Cycle Research Institute, which
estimates peak-to-trough recession dates for a variety of countries. We have confirmed that the recessions dated by this provider for the US and Europe match those dated by the NBER and CEPR and
that they track the cyclical behavior of GDP.

Notes: Tables are generated from models that are estimated from 2005:M1 to 2017:M2 sample. We
show two approaches: (1) SSP and (2) BMY, i.e., a 3-variable VAR approach that includes the 5y-1y
nominal bond spread, asset dividend to earnings ratio, and dividend growth.

Notes: We provide the SSP results based on the in-sample forecasts. The estimation sample is from
2005:M1 to 2017:M2. Our prediction sample is from 2005:M1 to 2013:M2. We use ∗ to indicate the
statistical significance at the 90% confidence level.
