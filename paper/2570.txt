An important but unresolved

issue addressed

relates to the substantial

difference between the rates of return on physical and R&D capital reported
in the literature.

Previous empirical work (see Griliches

[1980], Minasian

[1969], and Mansfield [1965]) has found, and left unexplained,
that the marginal

value of R&D (measured for example by the marginal

product) exceeds both the marginal value of physical

The marginal

value of R&D is

(i.e. the interest rate) because

the former must be sufficiently large to cover the marginal costs of
adjustment.

Moreover,

the reason that the marginal value of R&D exceeds

the value for physical capital

is due

to the fact that the marginal adjust-

ment costs associated with R&D are greater than the costs for physical
capital.

This implies that the deviation between the marginal value of R&D

Price Elasticities of Factor Demands

There are two sets of price elasticities which are relevant to the

It is often difficult to relate particular estimates to other research,

because of differences in model specification and data. However, if we look
at the cost of adjustment models using aggregate data with at least two

factors where labor and physical capital were decomposed (e.g.

into skilled and unskilled for labor), the own price elasticity of physical

This is just

another way of stating that P&E and R&D capital are substitutes for labor.

Therefore in each industry we find that overshooting occurs for labor.
This finding is consistent with Morrison and Berndt [1981], where
unskilled labor is a variable factor of production whose short-run output
elasticity is 1.349, and because they impose constant returns to scale, the
long—run elasticity is 1.

The long—run output elasticity is roughly con-

sistent with those surveyed in Hamermesh [1976], and in Pindyck and
Rotemberg

[1982(a),

1982(b)],
