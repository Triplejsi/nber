JEL No. J21,J31,J61,N32,R12
ABSTRACT
We examine local labor markets in the U.S. and Canada from 1990 to 2011 using comparable
household and business data. Wage levels and inequality rise with city population in both
countries, albeit less in Canada. Neither country saw wage levels converge despite contrasting
migration patterns from/to high-wage areas. Local labor demand shifts raise nominal wages
similarly, although in Canada they attract immigrant and highly-skilled workers more, while
raising housing costs less. Chinese import competition had a weaker negative impact on
manufacturing employment in Canada. These results are consistent with Canada's more
redistributive transfer system and larger, more-educated immigrant workforce.

Introduction

The cities of Canada and the United States share much in common, and there are many
reasons to believe that local labor markets in the two countries should operate similarly.
Both countries have a similar history of settlement, and their cities resemble each other in
age and construction. Each country is the other’s largest trading partner, and they share
the longest land border in the world.
Nevertheless, local labor markets in Canada and the U.S. may operate differently for
several reasons. While both countries share similar labor market institutions, unions and
legal protections for workers tend to be stronger in Canada. Transfers to individuals and to
local governments are also much larger in Canada. These factors may cause Canadian workers
to respond less to local economic conditions. Furthermore, Canada selects immigrants more
strongly on economic criteria than the U.S., and hence Canadian immigrants may respond
more to local economic opportunities.
In this paper, we analyze U.S. and Canadian local labor markets in a unified empirical
setting with comparable data.1 By using similar data, time periods, and methods, we can
draw clearer conclusions about how the two countries differ and, in many ways, also resemble
each other. In contrast, most other work on growth and inequality across regions — see
Barro et al. (1991) for the U.S. and Coulombe and Lee (1995) for Canada — has focused
on differences across large areas using macro data. Analyses using metropolitan areas across
countries are quite rare, especially using micro data.
Our analysis begins with a descriptive comparison of wage rates, wage inequality, skill
sorting, and economic convergence across metro areas in Canada and the U.S., involving
several of the canonical approaches outlined in Moretti (2011). Mirroring previous studies,
we find a strong positive association between city size and both wage levels and inequality
in the U.S.2 These associations are much weaker in Canada. When we compare cities of the
same size we find university graduates sort similarly towards larger cities in both countries.
However, we find that immigrants sort towards larger cities more in Canada than in the U.S.3

We take metropolitan areas to be “local” labor markets in both countries.
See Glaeser and Maré (2001) for wage levels, and Baum-Snow and Pavan (2013) for wage inequality.

Moretti (2013) and Diamond (2016) document rising levels of sorting of university graduates in the U.S.
Lee (1999) argues that regional minimum wages reduced local inequality for lower percentiles. Fortin and
Lemieux (2015) find similar results for Canadian provinces, and find that resource booms lifted wages and
reduced inequality in several provinces.

We additionally consider whether wages across cities converge over time. In both countries,
wage disparities across cities appear stubbornly persistent. This similarity is remarkable
given that in Canada we find that workers moved to higher-wage areas, while in the U.S.
they did not (Ganong and Shoag, 2018). Overall, these descriptive analyses of the differences
between local labor markets across both countries provide a valuable baseline for our ensuing
analysis of the effect of local labor demand shifts.
The persistence of wage differences, together with contrasting migration patterns across
Canada and the U.S., motivates the second part of our analysis. This part considers the
causal impact of local labor demand shifts within a standard spatial equilibrium framework.
We model these shifts using two key and well-known approaches. First, we consider changes
in labor demand predicted by nationwide sectoral shifts, as in Bartik (1991), providing the
first such analysis for Canada.4 Leveraging variation in business and household data for each
country, we make novel use of two “Bartik” shift-share instruments.
We find that the Bartik shift-shares predict similar increases in employment and nominal
wages in either country, implying similar elasticities of local labor supply to nominal wage
levels. However, when we exclude American megacities and reweight Canadian cities to
resemble U.S. demographics, U.S. labor supply begins to look more elastic. Furthermore,
we find that university graduate and immigrant responses to local labor market demand
shocks are relatively higher in Canada. We also find Canadian housing costs responded less
to demand changes, meaning that the real wages of Canadians responded more.
We finish by examining how the U.S. and Canada responded differently to increased import competition from Chinese manufacturing, following Autor et al. (2013). Our results
indicate that this competition had a weaker effect on manufacturing employment in Canada
than in the U.S. This result is consistent with the moderate decline of Canadian manufacturing relative to the U.S. from 1990–2007. While our data limit the ability to identify the
exact cause of the discrepancy, it may be explained by differences in the demographics of
places most affected by Chinese competition.
Overall, the U.S.–Canada differences we observe are consistent with differences in policy
4

The Bartik method was popularized by Blanchard and Katz (1992), who argue that wages and worker
migration cause unemployment effects of demand shifts to disappear over the long run. Other work examines
differential effects by skill group (Bound and Holzer, 2000), transfer payments (Autor and Duggan, 2003),
and housing costs (Notowidigo, 2011). Studies on other countries (e.g., Détang-Dessendre et al. (2016) for
France) are generally not done in tandem with others, except for macro studies, such as Decressin and Fatas
(1995), who consider 51 regions within the European Union.

on immigration and in personal transfers. Canada’s more numerous and educated immigrants appear more oriented towards urban opportunities. Their responsiveness to changes
in economic conditions suggest that they may indeed “grease the wheels” of the national
labor market even more than their American counterparts (Borjas, 2001; Cadena and Kovak, 2016). At the same time, there is no more evidence in Canada than in the U.S. that
within-country migration does much to depress persistent wage disparities across cities.
A number of facts also indirectly support the notion that individual and intergovernmental transfers lower geographic mobility. Once we control for differences in Canada–U.S.
demographics and exclude America’s housing-inelastic megacities, Canadians do appear to
be slightly less mobile. This finding is in line with Notowidigo’s (2011) hypothesis that
greater individual transfers may hinder geographic mobility.5 The point is arguably reinforced by the fact that Canadian housing costs were less responsive to labor demand shifts
than in the U.S. Tax and transfer programs (both individual and intergovernmental), which
redistribute nominal wage differences across cities, should depress demand shifts’ effects on
housing prices. If instead housing cost changes were orthogonal to demand shifts by accident, then Canadian workers did receive a greater proportion of the benefits and costs of
these changes through their real wages. In either case, demand shifts were passed on to local
property owners to a greater extent in the U.S.
In section 2 we briefly discuss theoretical considerations and key features of the U.S. and
Canadian institutions and transfer systems that could affect local labor market outcomes in
both countries. In section 3, we outline the Census, business, and other data used in the
analysis. In section 4, we examine how cross-sectional labor market patterns vary by metro
population. In section 5, we then consider more dynamic changes, with a brief overview of
aggregate trends, wage persistence, and labor mobility. Then, in sections 6 and 7 we examine
how local labor markets respond to demand shifts. In section 8, we conclude by discussing
the possible sources of Canada–U.S. differences.
5

We find that local labor demand shocks increase the university-educated share of the population to a
greater extent in Canadian cities. This may be the result of higher transfers in Canada discouraging the
mobility of those with lower education, as suggested by Notowidigo (2011). Alternatively, this may be due to
the influx of university-educated immigrants to Canadian cities during our study period, as documented in
Warman and Worswick (2015).

Spatial Equilibrium, Fiscal Policy, and Institutions in Local Labor Markets in the U.S. and Canada

In this section we provide an overview of local labor market theory to guide our empirical
analysis. Additionally, we discuss how immigration and government transfer policies in
Canada and the U.S. may affect labor mobility in each country.
2.1

Theory of Local Labor Market Equilibrium

The standard model of local labor markets assumes that workers move across cities to maximize utility, while firms and capital achieve equal returns across cities. It produces differences in wage and employment outcomes in spatial equilibrium mainly due to variation
in productivity and quality of life across cities. Using an augmented version of the Rosen
(1979)–Roback (1982) model, Albouy (2016) and Albouy et al. (2013) argue that level (or
persistent) differences in wages across cities in the U.S. and Canada are largely driven by
underlying firm productivity. Productivity differences, key in determining labor demand,
are driven by many factors, including urban agglomeration economies, natural advantages,
and access to export markets.6
Quality-of-life amenities, enjoyed by households, increase the supply of workers for a
given wage. In equilibrium, these amenities lower real wages, as workers accept lower consumption levels to enjoy them. These lower real wages, in turn, are manifested primarily
through higher costs of living, for example, in housing costs. How the supply of labor to
cities responds to (nominal) wages or amenities depends critically on the supply of housing
(Moretti, 2011). Cities where the supply of housing adjusts little to demand may experience
large cost increases but little employment growth. The other main determinant of local labor
supply is moving costs, psychic and otherwise. It is generally assumed that these costs follow
an increasing schedule, meaning that, on the margin, workers require higher real wages to
expand their supply.7 Existing (inframarginal) workers in an expanding local labor market
are made better off by such real wage increases. Local property owners are made better off
6

In larger metro areas, agglomeration economies potentially benefit workers through reduced search frictions, better matching, and greater human capital accumulation (Baum-Snow and Pavan, 2013). Arguably,
frictions created by institutions may lower this return while also reducing the inequality they engender. Larger
cities also offer a greater variety of consumer products and neighborhood public goods. See Baum-Snow and
Pavan (2012) and Baum-Snow et al. (2018) for work on causal mechanisms.
7
These costs are often microfounded through smooth variability in preference heterogeneity, e.g., Diamond
(2016).

4

when demand shifts raise local land values through increases in housing costs.
This standard model of location and mobility can be amended to handle unemployment
outcomes and worker heterogeneity. Kline and Moretti (2013) incorporate a search model and
find that higher productivity levels lower equilibrium unemployment and raise employmentto-population ratios. Modeling heterogeneous workers, Black et al. (2009) find that highly
educated workers — more common to the U.S. — sort toward high-wage areas as they can
better afford higher housing costs.
2.2

Immigration Policy and Local Labor Markets

Canada admitted over twice as many legal immigrants as the U.S. per capita over our study
period.8 Since Canada admits a higher fraction of immigrants, this should make the Canadian
population more mobile on average, ceteris paribus. Canada–U.S. differences in the criteria
for selecting immigrants may further strengthen the relative importance of immigrants on
issues related to mobility. In the U.S., most immigrants enter under family reunification and
may locate based on where existing family live. This contrasts with Canadian immigration
policy, as over half of Canadian immigrants are selected based on economic criteria (Warman
et al., 2019). Therefore, immigrants to Canada may be more likely to follow economic
incentives when choosing where to live. Canada’s immigration policy also favors universityeducated immigrants, which may change the level of education in cities.
In general, immigrants appear to be more mobile than the native-born population, and
more willing to move to places with greater economic opportunities (Borjas, 2001; Cadena
and Kovak, 2016). A more debatable issue is whether immigrants have an important effect
on local wage levels. Simple models of local labor markets with fixed factors imply that an
influx of workers to a city will lower its wages. In this case, labor mobility can reduce wage
differences across cities, as workers move to higher-wage areas (Ganong and Shoag, 2018).
Thus, higher immigrant numbers could reduce interregional wage differences, if markets are
not already in equilibrium. It is worth noting that such theories are at odds with urban
agglomeration models that predict wages to rise with the number of workers. Indeed, work
by Card (2001) and others has generally found little effect of immigrants on local wages.
8
However, this may overestimate the relative fraction of the foreign-born population in our Census sample.
For example, it will depend on how undocumented migrants, which make up a higher fraction of the U.S.
population, are captured in the Census data. As well, differences in out migration may also impact the
relative importance of the foreign-born population. Aydemir and Robinson (2008) estimate very high rates
of out migration in Canada, particularly for young working-age male immigrants.

5

Lastly, immigrants may sort across markets differently from natives. They may have
stronger tastes for certain amenities (Albouy et al., 2018). Or they could be more attracted
to high-cost, high-wage areas, as many make remittances and consume relatively little locally
(Albert and Monras, 2019).
2.3

Fiscal Policy: Taxes and Transfers to Governments and Individuals

Canada’s more redistributive interregional policies should arguably reduce how much Canadians move relative to Americans in the pursuit of higher wages. While federal taxes in
both countries reduce incentives to move to high-wage areas (Albouy, 2009), Canada provides larger social insurance transfers to individuals, and larger local government transfers
through equalization payments. This generally benefits lower-wage regions, such as the Atlantic provinces. The U.S. has no explicit form of equalization outside of a few programs that
operate at a smaller scale, such as Empowerment Zones.9 Accounting for intergovernmental
transfers, the typical dollar earned through worker migration is implicitly taxed by over 30
percent in the U.S., while in Canada the tax is roughly double that percentage (Albouy,
2012).
The means-testing of individual transfers should further dull incentives, as various clawbacks raise the effective marginal tax rate even further. Although programs differ by location
and individual, these disincentives appear to be generally stronger in Canada (Hoynes and
Stabile, 2017). However, as noted in Milligan and Schirle (2017), the relative generosity of
the U.S. disability insurance system could do more to pull U.S. workers out of the labor
force.10
In analyzing labor markets, unemployment insurance is an especially important transfer.
The Canadian insurance program is generally more centrally run. Incomplete experiencerating and regional targeting causes areas with higher unemployment rates to effectively
receive greater net transfers.11
9

See Busso et al. (2013). Note the U.S. does potentially subsidize low-wage areas by providing them
with greater intergovernmental transfer match rates, e.g., Federal Medical Assistance Percentages. But since
total payments rely on local generosity, these higher match rates rarely lead to greater federal transfers
(Chodorow-Reich et al., 2012).
10
The lack of universal insurance in the U.S. over our period could lower U.S. mobility rates by reducing
turnover through “job lock” (Madrian, 1994), or raise mobility as those without insurance may move to
procure it, i.e., through “employment lock” (Garthwaite et al., 2014).
11
Unemployment insurance and unemployment duration have traditionally been higher in Canada than
in the U.S. This was especially true up until the late 1990s, when Canadian unemployment benefits fell
precipitously after a series government cuts. See, for example, Battle (1998). Further, at the end of our
sample period unemployment benefits jumped in the U.S., as American policy makers sought to offset the

6

All in all, one would expect larger transfers to discourage mobility in Canada relative
to the U.S. This may be especially true for lower-income workers. Furthermore, transfers
should dampen the effect of nominal wage increases on local housing costs. While it may
appear that Canadians are seeing greater responses in real wages, the effects may be greatly
muted through redistribution.
In concluding this section, we note that higher unionization rates and minimum wages
might also affect local labor markets, reducing mobility and stiffening wage adjustments.12

Data and Methods

3.1

Census Data

3.1.1

U.S. Public Use and Canadian Master File Data

We draw much of our analysis from geographically detailed Census data. For the U.S.,
public use geographic identifiers are generally adequate for defining metro areas, which have
populations above 50,000. Therefore, we use the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series
(IPUMS) from Ruggles et al. (2015) using the 1990 and 2000 Census 5 percent samples,
and the American Community Survey (ACS), pooling the years 2005 to 2007 (referred to
as “2007”) and 2009 to 2011 (“2011”). Overall, this leaves us with a sample of 264 metro
areas.13 We use the terms “cities” and “metros” interchangeably throughout this paper.
Public use micro data files from the Census for Canada are generally inadequate for
studying most local labor markets since they identify few metro areas. We circumvent these
problems by using the restricted access 20 percent Canadian Master File Census data for
effects of the Great Recession. Generally, the paths of unemployment duration document the stark differences
in the severity of the Great Recession across the U.S. and Canada.
12
See Card and Riddell (1993) for an early U.S.–Canada comparison. Union coverage rates have declined
in both countries but remain more than 10 percentage points higher in Canada (see panel G of table A1). In
fact, few U.S. metros have unionization rates as high as those found in the least unionized Canadian metros.
This makes it difficult to compare. Nevertheless, unions are thought to increase employment stability and
reward seniority, thereby reducing geographic mobility and making wage structures more rigid (Zimmerman,
2008). The minimum wage is determined provincially in Canada; in the U.S., the federal government provides
a wage floor, which some states top up. Recent work on local labor markets by Monras (Forthcoming) argues
that minimum wages raise local wages but drive workers away. Such effects would likely play a larger role in
Canada, where real minimum wages rose over this period, than in the U.S., where they fell. See DiNardo and
Lemieux (1997) for an earlier analysis.
13
Large metro areas use the Consolidated Metropolitan classification, so that Oakland is joined to San
Francisco, and Stamford to New York. These areas are defined using 1999 Office of Management and Budget
definitions. For New England, we use New England County Metro Area (NECMAs) definitions to make
better use of county-level data. In a small number of cases, we use a probabilistic matching system based
on the overlap between Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) and metropolitan areas. Because PUMAs
generally comprise populations of 100,000 or more, this largely precludes analyzing areas with less than
50,000 populations. Analyzing them would require restricted access U.S. data, which are not currently at our
disposal.

7

1991, 2001, and 2006 (referred to as 1990, 2000, and 2007, respectively, in our tables/figures
to remain consistent with the reference years for our U.S. data).14 Thus, while the population
of Canada is smaller than the U.S., it is drawn from a sample large enough to be very precise.
We also use the restricted access 2011 National Household Survey data.15 To compensate for
the smaller number of cities in Canada, we consider a lower population threshold than for
the U.S. to determine whether an area is included in the sample, namely that of a working
age population of 15,000 or more in 1990. This leaves us with 82 Canadian metro areas.16
3.1.2

Overlap in Population Size

Together, the metro areas in our sample account for about four-fifths of the population in each
country. However, nine U.S. metros are bigger than the largest Canadian metro (Toronto).
These U.S. megacities appear to have difficulty growing (Rappaport, 2018), which may have
something to do with tighter housing supply.17 Twenty-eight Canadian agglomerations are
smaller than our smallest U.S. metro (Enid). Given this, we examine how sensitive our
results are to excluding the smallest Canadian and largest U.S. cities, with the lower and
upper bounds given by Enid and Toronto. The cities that are dropped based on this exclusion
account for 37% of workers in the U.S. and less than 5% of workers in Canada.
3.1.3

Timing of Samples and Macroeconomic Conditions

One issue we face with comparing the U.S. and Canada is slight differences in time periods.
The U.S. Decennial Census data correspond to April 1, 1990, and 2000, for outcomes such
as employment, and to the previous calendar year for earnings. In Canada, the Census day
is in mid-May, with the previous week being the reference week for employment, and the
previous calendar year for earnings.18
14

We also provide Bartik estimates in the appendix using the 1980 U.S. Census and 1981 Canadian Census
data. However, our main analysis does not include these data in order to remain consistent with the available
years of Canadian Business Pattern data.
15
This data should be treated cautiously due to its non-mandatory nature. The response rate was around
68 percent in 2011, whereas it was over 95 percent in previous Censuses. The sample was increased to 33
percent of households instead of 20 percent of households in previous Censuses.
16
Canadian metro areas are formed from municipalities (Census subdivisions). From 2001 definitions, we
use 32 “Census Metropolitan Areas” as well as 50 “Census Agglomerations.” A small problem with comparing
Canadian metro areas to (Consolidated) U.S. ones is that the latter are somewhat broader in land area because
they are formed out of counties, which can be quite large. For example, Oshawa is a CMA separate from
Toronto, even though its Census subdivisions are still in the “Greater Toronto Area.”
17
According to numbers from Saiz (2010), the elasticity of housing supply in these cities is on average half
that of other U.S. cities.
18
Construction of weekly and hourly wage series is hampered by differences in how weekly hours are
reported in Canada, which apply only to a reference week, while the U.S. asks for typical hours. The annual
earnings and weeks worked are reported for the reference calendar year. We calculate weekly earnings for

8

In the U.S., the recessions are dated to have started in July 1990, March 2001, and
December 2007, always after the data collection. In Canada, both the Census employment
reference week and earnings reference year occurred during the 1990–1992 recession. Therefore, all variables for this Census were recorded amid the early 1990s recession in Canada.
For the American Community Survey, the U.S. data refer to broader periods of 3 years, but
2005–2007 and 2009–2011 are largely outside of recessions. We deflate the monetary values
into 2010 dollars using each countries’ respective Consumer Price Index, and then use the
2010 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) to deflate the Canadian into U.S. dollars. We use a
OECD PPP for 2010 of 1.220 Canadian dollars per U.S. dollar.19
3.1.4

Location and Skill Indices

We decompose wage differences across metro areas according to what is explained by location
and what is explained by observed worker characteristics. Using the logarithm of weekly
k , for worker i in city j in year t in country k, we fit regressions for each countrywages, wijt

where Xitk are location-invariant worker characteristics, whose returns βtk can vary by country
and year. The “fixed effects” µkjt are coefficients on indicator variables for each city in each
time period. With an orthogonal error term εkijt , the µkjt represent the average effect of
location j on the wages of a typical worker.20 Taking the expectation of wages by year and
metro area, the average metro-level wage is given by the sum of the skill and location index

where X̄jt = Ei [Xijt ] denotes the average characteristics, and Ei [εkijt ] = 0.
For a simpler measure of skill, we consider the log of the university-educated share of the
people employed in the reference year so that the earnings calculations are more comparable for the two
countries and the wages better match the timing of the industry of employment information. For that reason,
we generally focus on comparisons of weekly wages.
19
This PPP is quite stable during our sample period with a mean value of 1.218 and coefficient of variation
of 1.2 percent for the years 1990–2011. Our OECD PPP is sourced from CANSIM table 36-10-0100-01.
20
Despite the tremendous potential for confounding unobservables, the overall pattern of wages across U.S.
and Canadian cities appear consistent with one of spatial equilibrium. In general, wage levels — controlling for
differences in observed worker characteristics — appear to compensate workers, by and large, for differences
in amenities as well as costs of living (Albouy et al. (2013), Albouy (2016)).

population (see appendix section B.1). This measure is only weakly correlated with the skill
index as the skill index is based on a finer measurement of education and includes variables
on minority status, immigrant background, and other characteristics.
For wage dispersion within cities, we use two measures. The first is the log ratio of the
wages of university graduates to high school graduates; the second is the log ratio of the wage
at the 90th percentile to that of the 10th . The first is more a measure of the local return to
education; the second is a measure of overall local inequality.
3.2

Business Data

We obtain employment data from the U.S. County Business Patterns from the U.S. Census
and the Canadian Business Patterns from Statistics Canada. For brevity we jointly refer
to these datasets using the “CBP” moniker. Both CBP datasets for the U.S. and Canada
report the number of firms within employment ranges at the SIC/NAICS industry level.
For the U.S. CBP data, we first convert all industry codes to the SIC 1987 3-digit level of
aggregation and then impute actual employment within each industry following Autor et al.
(2013).
A major limitation of the CBP is that the data are top coded and somewhat coarse,
especially in Canada. We enhance the Canadian Business Patterns data with the micro data
from the Annual Survey of Manufacturing (ASM). We access plant-level ASM data at the
Canadian Centre for Data Development and Economic Research (CDER) using an updated
version of the data from Baldwin and Li (2017). To align with our other data, we use the
ASM employment counts for 1991, 2001, 2007, 2011 (referred to as 1990, 2000, 2007, and
2011, respectively, in our tables/figures to remain consistent with the reference years for our
U.S. data). The ASM covers employment in all manufacturing establishments with revenue
above a low threshold.21
We also use administrative micro data from CDER to create a crosswalk from SIC-E 1980
to NAICS 1997. The ASM micro data has NAICS industry classification for all our periods.
However, the Canadian CBP data for the 1990s uses the SIC-E 1980 industrial classification,

For much of the observation period the minimum annual threshold is $30,000, although there is some
variation in this cut-off across industries and over time. The updates to the Baldwin and Li (2017) ASM micro
dataset reflect efforts to address a change in survey population that was in effect during the period 2004–2006.
Administrative data were used to add back in the employment counts for plants that were excluded from the
ASM sample post-2004 due to the changes in the survey population during the 2004–2006 period. We thank
Jiang Li at CDER for her effort in updating the ASM micro dataset for this project.

Propensity-Score Reweighting

To examine the importance of the demographic and institutional differences between the
two countries, we reweight the Canadian sample to resemble the U.S. sample in terms of
available start period demographic, industry, and institutional characteristics. We use the
standard propensity score reweighting methodology, popularized by DiNardo et al. (1996).23
The first set uses the share of the population with a university degree and the share that are
foreign born. The second set adds the share of employment in manufacturing and in oil and
an institutional variable, namely minimum wages.24

Local Labor Market Patterns by Metro Area

4.1

Relationships with Metro Size

In this section we consider how wage levels, inequality, and worker sorting vary across metro
areas according to their size. These relate to important agglomeration issues discussed earlier
and the overall labor markets of cities.
Table 1 presents a succession of descriptive regressions showing the relationship between
these outcomes and the standard regressor for city size, the logarithm of population. We
interact this regressor with a Canadian indicator to highlight differences between the U.S.
and Canada.25 Panel B uses our common city sample. These cities are shown in figure 1,
22

SIC-E 1980 is a Canadian industrial classification and differs substantially from the American SIC 1987
industrial classification. Therefore, the NAICS 1997 to SIC 1987 crosswalk from Autor et al. (2013) cannot
be used to crosswalk the Canadian CBP data.
(p|X)
23
We adjust the weight by multiplying the 1990 population weight by W = U S + (1 − U S) ∗ (1−(p|X))
.
U S is one if the city is in the U.S. and zero if it is in Canada. (p|X) is the conditional probability that the
city equals one. Table A2 shows the probit estimates used for reweighting for both the first and second sets
in columns (1) and (2), respectively. In table A3 we show the predicted probabilities for a select set of cities
for both specifications. We top code the top 5 odd ratios and bottom code the bottom 5 odds ratios.
24
Given the lack of common support for unionization rates in Canada and the U.S., we were not able to
include unionization rates in this analysis.
25
In addition, the model includes indicators and interactions with population for Québec and Hispanophone
communities. We also include decadal indicators interacted with a country indicator in each regression.

which plots wages relative to metro population in 1990. Panels C and D of table 1 consider
the role of aggregate city characteristics by reweighting the Canadian sample to resemble
the U.S. sample, as discussed in section 3.4.
Column 1 of table 1 displays how wages differ across metropolitan areas. Across years in
panel A, the wage-population elasticity is 0.065 in the U.S. In Canada, the gradient is only
half that size. The interaction becomes weaker in panel B, as the gradient in the U.S. is
quite steep for its larger cities, as seen in figure 1. Panel C shows that putting more weight
on Canadian cities that resemble U.S. cities in terms of their demographic characteristics
further reduces the gap in the gradient. In panel D, we find that reweighting by start period
demographic, industrial, and institutional characteristics pushes the gap up slightly.
This relationship from column 1 largely persists in column 2, which uses the wage location
index from (2), controlling for observable worker skills. The gap in the gradient is slightly
weaker as the skill index, seen in column 3, falls slightly, but insignificantly, with city size in
Canada. This difference becomes more pronounced once we control for common city sizes in
Panel B.
Columns 4 and 5 address issues of skill and immigrant sorting. Here we see that university
graduates sort into larger cities in both countries, where there is no difference in the sorting
patterns of university graduates once we account for common city sizes. At the same time,
as we see in column 5, immigrants are much more likely to sort into larger cities as well.
Since immigrants earn less than comparable natives, this sorting lowers the “skill index”
or predicted wages workers command based on their observable characteristics. Immigrant
sorting to larger metros is even stronger in Canada than in the U.S. where in panel B, when
we drop the largest metros from the U.S. and smallest from Canada, the difference becomes
stronger. Further, when we reweight on start of sample demographics, including the (initial)
1990 share of the population that is foreign born, this difference becomes even larger.26
It is well documented that wage inequality is greater in the U.S. than in Canada. The
point made here is that this inequality gap grows with metro population, as measured by
the university/high school wage premium in column 6, and the 90/10 differential in column
26

The reason why the Canadian slope coefficient gets larger can be seen by looking at the cities with
the largest predicted probabilities in table A3, which determine the magnitude of the DiNardo et al. (1996)
weight. Many of the cities with the highest weights (e.g., Rimouski and Chicoutimi) have relatively low
population and a small foreign share of the population. Heavily weighting these observations in the left tail
of the population distribution has a strong influence, pulling down the left side of the regression line and
making it steeper.

12

7. Furthermore, the gradient differences become weaker in panel B, since wage inequality
is greatest in the largest U.S. metros. The gap in the gradient does remain significant for
the 90/10 wage differential. In panel C, when we reweight according to demographic characteristics, the differences between the Canadian and U.S. gradients are no longer statistically
significant, although this is partly due to the estimates losing precision.27 In general, the
return to education is larger in the U.S. than in Canada. This makes it advantageous for
the more-educated to move to the U.S., and the less-educated to move to Canada (Card,
2003). This advantage is magnified if we consider a move from a small Canadian city to
large American one.
Finally, in the last column we note how housing costs increase with population size
(see appendix section B.2 for a brief discussion on how we construct this variable). While
the Canada–U.S. difference is large, it disappears without the largest U.S. cities. However,
the fact that wages rise more slowly in Canada than in the U.S. with population implies
that larger Canadian metros are less affordable than U.S. metros of comparable size. In an
equilibrium framework, this suggests that larger cities in Canada are relatively more desired
for their quality-of-life amenities.
In sum, the equilibrium relationship studied here tells us that on the one hand urbanization in Canada is associated with less of a wage premium and less income inequality than in
the U.S. On the other hand, larger Canadian cities are even more attractive to immigrant
workers and suffer more from affordability issues.

Changes in Labor Market Outcomes Over Time, Sector, and Space

In this section we present descriptive statistics that help link sectoral shifts over time with
local impacts on labor markets, setting up our next section on local demand shifts.
27

These inequality relationships did not exist in 1980, but have come to be a remarkable feature of large
cities (Baum-Snow and Pavan, 2012). In panel D, when we further add controls for start period industry
shares and minimum wage to our reweighting, the difference remains very similar to those in panel C. The
patterns of urban wage inequality in Canada are decidedly weaker. In fact, it appears that the urban wage
premium for university graduates relative to high-school graduates is growing at half the rate in Canada as
it is in the U.S. The top panel of figure A1 shows the scatter plots comparing the log university-high school
wage ratio for 1990 and 2011 for all the cities while the second panel shows the urban 90/10 differential. For
both measures, the inequality increased more in the U.S. than in Canada. While the urban 90/10 differential
in Canada in 1990 was typically lower in the larger cities than what was seen in the smaller cities, it grew at
a faster rate in the larger cities. Conversely, in the U.S., the 90/10 differential was generally greater in the
larger cities in 1990, and this difference has increased.

Aggregate Labor Dynamics by Sector

Figure 2 provides an overview of the annual variation in Canada and the U.S. over the
period 1980–2010.28 These four plots document the trends in hours worked and hourly labor
compensation by sector over this period using the World KLEMS data. It separates the
economy into 4 broad sectors.29 The top two plots show hours worked and mean hourly labor
compensation by sector, combining Canadian aggregates with much larger U.S. numbers.
The bottom two panels show values of these variables for Canada relative to the U.S.30
Panel 1A of Figure 2 shows the steady growth in hours worked in the services sector
and decline in the manufacturing and resource/utilities sectors from 1980–2010. This recent
structural transformation has been a common trend in most advanced economies. While
manufacturing remained the largest of the non-services sectors, its share of hours fell by
over half. Panel 1B shows that hourly labor compensation in manufacturing did remain on
average higher than the other three sectors over this entire period.
Panel 2A indicates that before 1995, Canadian manufacturing hours worked was, like the
population, about one-tenth of that in the U.S. In the late 1990s, it rose relative to the U.S.
before leveling off in the mid-2000s.
The construction sector’s share of total hours worked was higher in Canada than in the
U.S. for almost every year between 1980–2010. The Canada–U.S. ratio of construction hours
worked was volatile, punctuated by a dramatic rise after the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Hours
fell precipitously in the U.S. as the housing marketed crashed, while Canadians suffered only
a minor temporary setback.
Panel 2B shows that the resource/utilities sector’s share of hours worked is much higher
in Canada, especially from the mid-1980s onward. Oil and gas trends help explain the labor
28

Appendix table A1 provides a numerical overview of the aggregate labor markets in Canada and the U.S.
Panels B, C, and D show that employment and wages were initially higher in the U.S. in 1990, noting that
Census measures of unemployment differ from the U.S. Current Population Survey and the Canadian Labour
Force Survey. By 2011 these spreads narrowed or even reversed, as Canada experienced a mild recession in
the late 2000s while the Great Recession struck the U.S. Regarding demographics, U.S. workers began the
sample as more educated. This flipped towards the end of the sample. In terms of immigration, Canada
initially had a larger foreign-born share of the working age population, and while this metric grew in both
Canada and the U.S., it reached nearly 30% in 2011 in Canada.
29
We use the concordance in Gu (2012) to convert the KLEMS data from ISIC rev 3 to NAICS 2-digit.
The NAICS 2-digit classifications are as follows: resource/utilities - 11–22, construction - 23, manufacturing
- 31–33, and services - 41–91.
30
Hours worked is defined as the total hours worked by persons engaged in the sector. Hourly labor
compensation is defined as total labor compensation in the sector divided by hours worked. Canadian labor
compensation is converted to U.S. dollars at the average annual Canada–U.S. exchange rate downloaded from
the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, FRED.

dynamics of this sector. International demand caused oil employment to expand in the early
1980s, collapse in the mid-1980s before rapidly increasing in the early 2000s, and drop again
in the late 2000s.
The aggregated data do not show how concentrated these sectors are regionally. For
instance, both countries share a “manufacturing belt,” corresponding to a parallelogram from
Baltimore, west to St. Louis, north to Green Bay, and east to Maine, with the last border
cutting into southern Ontario and Québec (Krugman, 1991). While these areas suffered
from manufacturing decline, this was less of the case north of border from the late 1990s
onward. Natural resource booms were especially impactful in the less dense areas of Alberta
and Saskatchewan as well as in Texas and North Dakota. Meanwhile, construction booms
and busts were important in high-growth areas like Las Vegas and Florida, and Toronto and
Vancouver in Canada.
5.2

Cross-Metro Differences and Changes in Labor Market Outcomes

From 1990 to 2011, local labor market outcomes did shift considerably across metro areas.
Yet, despite the variation in these shifts across sectors, we find that inequalities in wages
across areas were remarkably consistent over time. Figure 3 plots variation in three different
outcomes for each country separately: weekly wages, the employment-population ratio, and
the manufacturing share. Outcomes for the year 2011 are plotted against those in 1990.
For completeness, we present outcomes for non-metro areas, averaged by state or province,
represented with a triangle.31
Looking first at the plots of the 1990 and 2011 weekly wage by metro (top of figure 3),
in 1990 wages in the U.S. were high in cities like New York, San Francisco, Washington, and
Detroit; in Canada, wages were high in Toronto, Ottawa, and Calgary, as well as in smaller
manufacturing and resource-oriented cities in the provinces of Québec and British Columbia.
Wages rose disproportionately in places like San Francisco, Washington, and all over Alberta.
Places like Detroit and non-metro Québec saw relative declines in wages. In both countries,
wage differences across cities appear to have grown between 1990 and 2011. More strikingly,
there was generally no wage convergence and, importantly, we still see persistent differences
31

For figure 3, we also include the additional nine Canadian metro areas as well as areas of
states/provinces/territories not part of metros. A city’s market is proportional to its population. These
additional metros and provinces/territories are not available in the CBP/ASM data and so are not included
in our main analysis.

15

between 1990 and 2011, with most cities close to the regression line.
Unlike with wages, we do see imbalances in the employment-population ratio that meanreverted in both countries, as shown in panel 2 of figure 3. This reversion, even stronger
in Canada, is consistent with findings for the U.S. of Blanchard and Katz (1992) that such
imbalances are generally short-lived.
Panel 3 of figure 3 presents the 2011 and 1990 manufacturing shares. While manufacturing shares fell over the 20-year period, metros with high shares in 1990 still had above average
shares in 2011. For example, in Canada, Granby had the highest manufacturing share in
both years. In the U.S., the two highest ranked metros in 1990, Elkhart and Hickory, were
still in the top 3 in 2011. Yet in both Canada and the U.S., the slope of regression line is
below 1, thus indicating that local manufacturing shares generally fell from 1990 to 2011, in
line with figure 2.
Figure 4 examines whether migration, or lack thereof, could be affecting wage convergence. Panel 1A shows that places with higher wages in 1990 saw less growth than lower-wage
areas. Ganong and Shoag (2018) argue that this pattern, which they attribute to housing
supply, is responsible for the lack of income convergence shown above. But as we see in panel
1B, Canada saw a different pattern of higher population growth in places with high initial
wages. Nevertheless, wage levels do not appear to have converged any more in Canada. This
suggests that barriers to labor mobility may not be the main obstacle to income convergence.32

6

Omnibus (“Bartik”) Sectoral Changes

Below we combine standard approaches to study local shifts in labor demand, following
Bartik (1991). This approach accounts for local demand shifts by predicting changes in
employment at the local level with the interaction of pre-determined industrial composition
and the national growth of workers in each industry. This omnibus approach benefits in its
generality by considering all industries with the overarching aim of causally estimating the
local impacts of labor demand changes and shocks on wages, mobility, welfare transfers, and
other key outcomes. The basis for this analysis extends back to Blanchard and Katz (1992).
32
In appendix figure A1, we also examine metro-level convergence in regards to the university-population
and foreign-born–population ratios. Broadly, we see little convergence in Canada and the U.S. in terms of
the university-population ratio. Concerning immigration (panel 4), we see slight convergence in the foreignborn–population ratio for the U.S., but nearly no convergence in Canada.

16

Our innovation is to examine Canada and the U.S. in unison and how the so-called “Bartik”
shocks differentially affect local labor markets in the two countries.
We contribute to the literature by considering two separately constructed Bartik instruments simultaneously. Each of these predicts an aggregate labor demand shift given by

∆Bjt =

1990
X Ejl
l

Ej1990

t
∆ ln Elk

(3)

1990 /E 1990 is the share of employment in city j that is in industry l in the base year;
where Ejl
j
t is the first difference change in the log of overall employment in industry l of
and ∆ ln Elk

country k (i.e., Canada or the U.S.).33
For any outcome, Y , the simultaneous equations system takes the form

∆ ln Ejt = αk ∆Bjt + ζkt + Xk θk + εEt
j

(4a)

∆ ln Yjt = βk ∆ ln Ejt + ηkt + Xk λk + εYj t

(4b)

The first-stage (4a) simply regresses actual log employment changes, ∆Ejt , on projected
changes. The coefficients αk may vary by country, as can time effects, ζkt , and the coefficients
on the controls Xk , which in our benchmark specification include a set of region indicators
for each country. The second-stage involves a vector of labor results in Y .
As the Bartik instrument relies on industrial classifications, it may be subject to errors.
This issue motivates our use of two separately constructed Bartik instruments: one using
Census data and the other constructed from the CBP for the U.S. and the CBP/ASM for
Canada. Census industrial classification is inferred from household responses, whereas for
the CBP data the classification is administratively determined by each country’s business
registry. Recognizing that there is error in both household and business reported data (Card,
1996), our approach of using two instruments leverages the strengths of each data source.
Indeed, the CBP data, for example, do not always provide an exact count of employees by
area, although they do provide the firm-size distribution. For both CBP datasets we impute
33

t
t
We calculate ∆ ln Elk
using a leave-one-out approach. That is, ∆ ln Elk
is city j specific and is computed
as the first difference change in the log of aggregate employment in industry l of country k, excluding the
change in employment in city j. We use this leave-one-out approach to mitigate concerns that pre-existing
trends at the city level may compromise the exogeneity of our Bartik instruments. To match the year of the
Census-derived outcome variables for each country, the base year is 1990 for the U.S. and 1991 for Canada.
To standardize our notation across both countries, we use the superscript 1990 to denote the base year in
each country.

17

employment counts, but for Canadian manufacturing data we use exact employment counts
from the ASM (in lieu of the CBP) to improve accuracy.34
6.1

Long Differences in the Reduced Form

To better see the relationship between the Bartik projection and observed outcomes, figure
5 illustrates reduced form outcomes using long differences between 1990 and 2011. This long
period may produce different estimates than higher-frequency ones because of the long-run
nature of the change. For brevity, we present only the Census Bartik projection relative
to employment and wages. In this simpler case, the indirect least squares (or instrumental
variable) estimate of the elasticity of the wage with respect to employment equals the ratio
of two slopes: that of the wage to that of employment. Since Bartik shocks are predictors of
demand growth, this elasticity is equal to the inverse elasticity of demand.
In the U.S., cities with the lowest predicted growth, such as Hickory, Elkhart, and
Danville, saw major declines in their textile mills and other manufacturing. Conversely, cities
such as Las Vegas and Santa Fe grew from expansions in service industries. In Canada, the
metros with the greatest positive shifts occurred around natural resources, such as Calgary
and Wood Buffalo (which contains Fort McMurray): employment levels there grew by over
50 percent. On the other end are cities with relative declines, such as Campbell River, with
a struggling natural resource sector, and manufacturing cities, such as Sarnia. In general,
we see that the Bartik instrument does, on average, predict employment in almost equal
amounts in both the U.S. and Canada, with a 10 percent increase in projected employment
predicting a 17 and 18 percent increase, respectfully. However, the fit was closer for Canada,
as evinced by the larger R2 . The wage response in Canada was also slightly stronger. Thus,
a 10 percent increase in projected employment is associated with an 8.6 and 11.3 percent
increase in wages.
Taking the ratio of the employment change in the first-stage to the wage change in the
reduced form provides an estimate of the elasticity of local labor supply to (nominal) wages.
34
From the Canadian and U.S. Census data, we construct 19 industries to calculate the Bartik instrument. The industries include Agriculture, Forestry/Logging, Fish, Coal, Mining, Petroleum, Manufacturing,
Construction, Transportation, Communication/Utilities, Wholesale, Retail, Finance/Insurance/Real Estate,
Business Services, Public Administration, Education, Health/Social Service/Professional, Accommodations,
Other Services. For the Canadian CBP data, we use NAICS 1997 4-digit classification, which has 321 industry
groups. Our U.S. CBP data have 3-digit SIC classification, providing 373 industries in the U.S. We exclude
NAICS 4-digit industries that we are unable to concord over NAICS vintages 1997–2007, or because of zero
employment counts in any NAICS or SIC industry. The Business Pattern data cover only the private sector.
Our algorithm for CBP imputation is from Autor et al. (2013).

18

In the U.S. this elasticity is 2.0, while in Canada it is 1.6. Thus, this simple evidence suggests
that the elasticity of local labor supply is somewhat elastic in both countries, albeit slightly
more in the U.S.
6.2

First-Stage Bartik Results

Table 2 examines each instrument’s first-stage relationship with metropolitan changes in
log employment using differenced data spanning 1990 to 2000, 2000 to 2007, and 2007 to
2011. The analysis here examines the predictive power of the Bartik instrument along three
dimensions: across household (Census) and business (CBP/ASM) surveys, in Canada relative
to the U.S., and for our benchmark sample (columns 1–3) versus one with a common city
size support (columns 4–6). The regressions are weighted by start of sample population, and
robust standard errors are clustered at the state/province level.35
In column 1, the elasticity of employment with respect to the Census Bartik instrument is
1.2 and 1.1 for the U.S. and Canada, respectively; however, this coefficient is more precisely
estimated in Canada. This may be due to the more detailed and greater quantity of data
in the Canadian master file data. Panel C pools data across the U.S. and Canada.36 The
resulting coefficient on the Bartik averages both countries and thus skews towards the U.S.
given population weighting. The bottom of the table also lists the p-value associated with
the null that the coefficients are equal across the U.S. and Canada. We cannot reject the
hypothesis that coefficients are the same. Thus, the Census instruments are correlated
similarly to actual employment changes across both countries.
Column 2 uses only the CBP/ASM instrument, and the estimated elasticities are 0.6 and
0.5 for the U.S. and Canada, respectively. Relative to column 1, the first-stage F-statistic
increases for the U.S., but in both columns the instrument is stronger for Canada.37 Again,
we cannot reject the hypothesis that the coefficients on the CBP/ASM Bartiks are equal
35
The regressions, set in first differences, include indicators for time periods and regions. Appendix table
A5 presents estimates for the 1980s separately, since only the Census instrument is available for that period.
Employment is measured with Census data and includes both public and private sector employment. For the
U.S., we use Census divisions. For Canada we define five Canadian regions as follows: Atlantic (Newfoundland
and Labrador, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island); Québec; Ontario; Prairies (Alberta,
Manitoba, and Saskatchewan); and British Columbia.
36
For these estimates, we interact decadal indicators with a country indicator.
37
We found that using only the Canadian CBP data, without the ASM data, resulted in a much weaker firststage relationship between the instrument and employment. The coarseness of the Canadian CBP employment
data, particularly for larger firms, motivated our use of the ASM data. Our CBP/ASM Bartik estimates use
confidential Statistics Canada micro data. Although these micro data are not publicly available, our Canadian
CMA-level CBP/ASM Bartik estimates have been vetted and are available upon request for future research.

19

across countries.
In column 3 we use both the Census and CBP/ASM Bartik instruments in tandem. For
Canada, both instruments have predictive power; however, the Census Bartik is stronger
both in magnitude and significance. Only the CBP Bartik remains statistically significant
for the U.S. Not surprisingly, the same holds true in the pooled sample.
In columns 4–6 of table 2, we repeat these estimates for the common city size sample to
show the effect from forcing a common city size support. Comparing columns 1 to 3 with 4 to
6 in panel A shows that the U.S. F-statistics increase across each of the specifications when we
use common city sizes: oddly, the first-stage is stronger without American megacities.38 For
Canada in panel B, dropping the smallest cities lowers the coefficients, and, not surprisingly,
the first-stage F-statistics as the number of observations falls. Yet congruent with columns
1 to 3, the Census Bartik outperforms the CBP/ASM Bartik in Canada for the common
city size sample. The pooled regression in panel C again reflects a weighted average across
Canada and the U.S.
In summary, the CBP/ASM Bartik instrument is the stronger of the two instruments
for the U.S., while the Census Bartik instrument performs better in Canada. We therefore
use the first-stage specifications with both instruments (columns 3 and 6) in our Two-Stage
Least Squares (2SLS) analysis in section 6.3, since each instrument has its relative strengths
in each country. However, our second-stage results do not differ much if we use only the
CBP/ASM or the Census Bartik instrument in the first-stage, as shown in tables A7 and
A8, respectively.39
6.3

Second-Stage Bartik Results

Table 3 presents the results of 2SLS regressions for several outcomes of interest on the
change in log employment. These outcomes correspond to a number of issues studied above.
They include controls for decadal and regional fixed effects (see footnote 35). Our table 3
estimates can be interpreted as elasticities of the outcome with respect to employment, as
all the outcomes are expressed in logarithms.
For wages, the U.S. and Canada estimates are similar: as measured by the location index
38

Changing tastes for city amenities (Davidoff, 2016) or inelastic housing supply may dull employment
effects in these cities.
39
In table A5 of the appendix we show that the Census Bartiks also perform well in the 1980s, with large
first-stage F-statistics in both countries. Note, the Canadian CBP/ASM data were unavailable for this earlier
period.

20

in column 1, a 10 percent increase in employment predicts a wage increase of slightly over
5 percent in either country. This estimate — which controls for the composition of workers
— provides the inverse elasticity of labor supply with respect to (nominal) wages. Thus, the
elasticity of labor supply with respect to wages is just below 2 in either country. This value is
similar to what is seen in the literature cited earlier, although it differs slightly from the long
difference estimates in section 6.1, where Canada’s supply elasticity was slightly smaller.
In column 2, the results for the population elasticity are below 1 in both the U.S. and
Canada, meaning that the population growth in response to a local employment demand
shock is less than one-for-one in either country. The elasticity is significantly higher for
Canada relative to the U.S. Column 7 provides evidence that immigrant population growth in
response to local labor demand shocks may explain the relatively higher population elasticity
in Canada. For Canada, a 10 percent increase in employment predicts a 15 percent increase
in the fraction of the population that is foreign born. For the U.S., this elasticity is negative
and insignificant, while the Canada–U.S. difference in the estimates is highly significant.
The higher population elasticity for Canada also explains the results in column 3. Because
the population rises more with employment in Canada, the elasticity of the employmentpopulation ratio, seen in column 3, is more modest.
The effects on the unemployment rate, seen in column 4, are similar in both countries.
While the magnitude of the effect is slightly smaller in logarithms in Canada, the effect on
the unemployment rate in percentage points is more similar, since Canada has on average
a higher unemployment rate. In column 5 we find that unemployment benefits, which are
much higher in Canada, have a relatively larger elasticity for the U.S. However, for the
unemployment rate and unemployment benefits, the difference in elasticities across the two
countries is too imprecise to be statistically distinguishable.
In column 6 we investigate the response of the composition of worker skills to employment
shocks. The wage skill index in both countries falls by roughly 2.5 percentage points for a
10-point increase in employment. In other words, the labor demand shifts predicted by
the Bartik shocks on average appear to attract a less-skilled work force. Thus, observed
unadjusted weekly wages rise by less than what the wage location index would imply. Not
accounting for these composition changes would thus bias the labor supply elasticity upwards.
In columns 7 and 8, we see significant differences between the U.S. and Canada with

21

respect to the elasticities for the fraction of the population that is foreign born and the
fraction that is university educated. For Canada, the elasticity for the fraction with a
university education is positive and highly significant; while for the U.S., the elasticity is
close to zero and insignificant. As previously discussed, the elasticity for the fraction that is
foreign born is positive and highly significant for Canada, but not for the U.S.
Warman and Worswick (2015) show that the percent of new immigrants to Canada with
a university degree increased in the early 1990s from around 25 percent to over 50 percent.
This influx may help explain why the fraction of university educated and foreign born reacted
so much in Canada. At the same time, the greater responsiveness of university graduates in
Canada implies a lower responsiveness of non-graduates. This implication appears consistent
with Canada’s more generous income transfer programs, which can especially dull incentives
for lower-skilled workers to move (Notowidigo, 2011).
Columns 9 and 10 show the employment elasticity of two measures of pay inequality: the
wage difference between university- and high school–educated workers, and the difference in
pay between the 90th and 10th percentiles. The results are rather imprecise, showing positive
point estimates for the elasticities of both inequality measures in both countries, although
none of the estimates are significantly different from zero at conventional sizes.
Finally, in column 11 we estimate the elasticity of housing costs to local labor demand
shocks. Here we see a strong and positive effect of an employment demand shock on housing
costs in the U.S., but not in Canada. Because employment and housing demand track each
other rather well, this implies that housing supply was much more elastic in the Canadian
cities that saw demand shifts predicted by the instrument.40
Since housing costs reduce the purchasing power of labor income, this result implies that
(pre-tax-and-transfer) real wages rise more in Canada than in the U.S. in response to a
positive labor demand shock. Therefore, residents in Canada, particularly renters, stand to
gain more from positive demand shocks and possibly lose more from negative shocks. At
40

The three sub-plots in figure A2 show the Canadian Bartik instrument plotted against the difference
in the log of housing prices for the periods 1990–2000, 2000–2007, and 2007–2011. The slope coefficient is
negative and significant for the 1990–2000 period, and positive for the latter two periods. This suggests
that the lack of responsiveness in Canadian housing costs to local labor demand shocks is largely driven by
the data from the 1990–2000 period. Consistent with this explanation, in our sensitivity analysis we found
that the Canadian housing cost elasticity is much closer to that of the U.S. when the sample is restricted
to exclude the 1990–2000 data. These results are available upon request. Using data on housing prices in
Canadian cities, Allen et al. (2009) also find that housing prices responded inconsistently across Canadian
cities to labor force changes during the period 1985–2005. Explaining why the elasticity of housing costs in
Canada becomes more similar to that of the U.S. after 2000 is an important topic for future research.

22

the same time, the lower elasticity of housing costs in Canada may be the result of greater
individual and intergovernmental transfers that act as insurance across regions. Places hit
with negative shocks receive greater transfers, helping to prop up falling prices. Those hit
with positive shocks see fewer of those gains realized locally, raising prices by less.
The results in table 4 focus on the Canada–U.S. differences in the elasticity estimates
under several alternative specifications.41 Panel A replicates the differences from table 3 to
provide a benchmark for comparison. Panel B shows the Canada–U.S. differences when the
elasticities are estimated using the common city size sample.42 Here we see that the wage
elasticity difference grows to 0.231, although this difference is not statistically significant at
the 10 percent level. At the same time, the Canada–U.S. difference in the population and
employment-to-population responses are smaller and no longer significant, as population
growth tracks employment growth more closely in the U.S. outside of its largest metros.
Most of the other differences remain the same, although the housing-cost estimate shrinks
somewhat.
Panel C of table 4 shows the Canada–U.S. differences when we use the common city
size sample and the DiNardo et al. (1996) method to reweight Canadian cities to resemble
U.S. cities in terms of their demographic characteristics, which we discuss in section 3.4.
Under this specification the difference in the wage elasticities grows from panel B and is
statistically significant at the 5 percent level. This provides evidence that labor supply
is more elastic in the U.S. than in Canada when we compare cities that are similar in
population and demographics. As in panel B, there is no statistically significant difference
in the elasticities for population and the employment-population ratio in the reweighted
specification. Interestingly, the Canada–U.S. difference in the elasticity of the university to
high school wage ratio is positive and becomes statistically significant at the 10 percent level,
as the magnitude of the difference increases only slightly and the standard errors shrink. In
all other respects the elasticity estimates in panel C are similar to those in panels A and B.
Finally, in panel D, we further reweight the Canadian sample with additional controls for
the minimum wage and the start of sample shares of employment in manufacturing and in oil.
Generally, the coefficients are analogous to those in panel C, with a few minor exceptions.

23

The takeaway from this section is that most local labor market responses to demand
shifts respond similarly in Canada and the U.S. However, the differing results on housing
costs suggest the labor supply elasticity in terms of real wages is much lower in Canada.
This could be the result of transfer programs or because of higher unobserved moving costs.
Comparing cities similar in characteristics, it also appears that the supply elasticity in terms
of nominal wages is lower in Canada, possibly from similar factors. The greater responsiveness of university-educated and immigrant populations could also be due to transfer or
immigration policy, or to institutional factors we did not account for.43

Import Competition from Chinese Manufacturing

Our second approach to studying the local labor market responses to economic shocks focuses
on import competition from China, following Autor et al. (2013). Relative to the Bartik
analysis, this approach is more specific in its focus on the effect of Chinese import competition
on manufacturing industries in Canada and the U.S. It also has a more plausible form of
exogeneity, since it depends on the rise in Chinese exports seen worldwide, not just sectoral
shifts in the U.S. and Canada, which shift for unobserved reasons. However, these “China
shocks” are smaller than the Bartik shocks, which makes it harder to identify their effects on
broad local labor market outcomes. Indeed, the goal here is to determine how Chinese import
competition impacted local manufacturing through very specific manufacturing subsectors,
whose local intensity varied considerably.
In line with previous work, our proxy for local import competition from China is given
by imports per worker (IPW) for each city j, in year t, in country k:

t
=
∆IP Wjk

t
X Ejl
∆M t

lk

l

t
Ejt Elk

(5)

t /E t is the ratio of city j employment in industry l relative to the total employment,
where Ejl
j
t is the first difference change in imports from China in industry
Ejt , in city j in year t. ∆Mlk
t is total employment in industry l in country k.44 Our data are set in
l for country k. Elk
43

We note that that our elasticity estimates are qualitatively different for the 1980–1990 period, as seen
in table A5. For instance, the wage response was much smaller in Canada. We suspect this may have had
something to do with stronger unions. We see a relatively small and non-significant Canada–U.S. difference
for the elasticity of the fraction of university educated. The fraction of foreign born are more responsive to
employment changes in both countries, possibly more so in Canada, but not significantly.
44
Autor et al. (2013) use a 10-year lag of manufacturing sector employment in the construction of their
instrument. Here we use contemporaneous employment since our NAICS 1997 classified manufacturing employment data for Canada begins in 1990. Note that all the import measures are recorded in U.S. dollars.

24

differences and cover two periods, 1990–2000 and 2000–2007, congruent with Autor et al.
(2013).
The change in IPW varies at the local level due to specialization in (1) manufacturing
relative to non-manufacturing sectors, and (2) local manufacturing industries with greater
import exposure risk, e.g., exposed textile versus non-exposed defense manufacturing. The
empirical structure rests on the claim that variation in IPW over time is due to structural
changes as China shifted more towards a market-based economy and ascended to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001.
Import competition from China could have increased because domestic demand shifted
to products supplied by the Chinese or because domestic industries faltered. If so, ordinary
least squares estimates of the effect of changes in IPW on local outcomes will be biased.
We thus follow Autor et al. (2013) by constructing an instrument using Chinese imports to
other Western countries.45 By using other Western countries’ Chinese imports, this instrument is intended to isolate the influence of growth in Chinese exports on the Canadian and
U.S. manufacturing sectors as distinct from contemporaneous domestic factors. To make the
first-stage estimates more comparable across the U.S. and Canada, we normalize the instrument for Canada by multiplying by the ratio of the American to Canadian manufacturing
employment in 1990.
7.1

First-Stage Results

Table 5 presents results from the first-stage relationships between IPW and its instrument.
We follow Autor et al. (2013) by including a control start of sample (Census-based) manufacturing share, as well as regional indicators. Due to slight differences in geography, our results
are not identical to Autor et al. (2013); yet we find a highly similar first-stage relationship
for the U.S.
For Canada, the coefficient on the IPW instrument is smaller, by an amount that is
statistically significant. Without the normalization, the effect would be smaller still, although
we note that our second-stage 2SLS results are independent of instrument normalization.
Indeed, it is the strength of the first-stage relationship that is of primary importance. In this
respect the IPW instrument performs well for Canada, as the first-stage F-statistic is 43.30.
45

For both Canada and the U.S. we use a common set of other Western countries in constructing our
instrument, namely Australia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, and Switzerland.

25

As an archetypal small open economy, it is not surprising that our instrument, which uses
other Western countries’ Chinese imports, is strongly predictive of Canadian IPW.
In the bottom panel B of table 5, we show the same first-stage regressions but using
the common city size sample. This amounts to removing the largest cities in the U.S. and
the smallest cities in Canada (see section 3.1.2). The magnitude of the coefficient estimates
on the instrument change little when we estimate the first-stage IPW regressions using a
common city sample. However, the first-stage F-statistics decline considerably, particularly
for Canada, due to the large sample size reduction.
7.2

Two-Stage Least Squares Estimates

Table 6 presents the 2SLS results for the core labor market outcomes. In panel A column
1, our estimate for manufacturing employment for U.S. metro areas of -4.4 log points differs
by only 0.2 log points from the estimate of -4.2 for U.S. commuting zones, as reported by
Autor et al. (2013). Our level of precision is also quite similar. For Canada, the decline in
manufacturing employment in response to imports from China is smaller than in the U.S.
The column 1 point estimate is -1.3 log points for Canada, and the precision of this estimate
is very similar to the U.S. with the standard error in either country being near 1 log point.
The Canada–U.S. difference in the point estimates is statistically significant, with a p-value
of 0.04; yet the Canadian point estimate is not statistically significant.
We see similar results for the employment-population ratio.46 The point estimate for
Canada is half that of the U.S., but no less precise. There is evidence that increased IPW
from China decreased the employment-population ratio in Canada, but the magnitude and
statistical significance of this effect is much stronger in the U.S. Thus, it appears that import
competition from China had a smaller effect on manufacturing employment in Canada than
in the U.S. This is consistent with the aggregate trends outlined in figure 2, which show
that the decline in Canadian manufacturing over the period 1990–2007 was moderate in
comparison to the U.S.
Our point estimates hint that the increase in Chinese imports may have lowered manufacturing wages, but the estimates are insignificant in both countries. For Canada, we find
little evidence that Chinese imports had any effect on the unemployment rate. For the U.S.,
we find a positive and statistically significant effect on the unemployment rate, as in Autor
46

Employment includes manufacturing as well as non-manufacturing employment.

26

et al. (2013).
Table 7 presents differences in the Canada–U.S. estimates under several alternative specifications. For the common city size specification, panel B shows that the Canada–U.S.
difference for the manufacturing employment point estimate falls from 0.31 to 0.22 and is
now insignificant.47 In panel C, we reweight based on the start of sample share of the population with a university degree and the share of foreign born. In this specification, we find the
Canada–U.S. difference in manufacturing employment shrinks and switches sign, although
it becomes very imprecise, pointing to limits in the reweighting strategy. In panel D, when
we reweight further using start of sample manufacturing and oil shares as well as minimum
wage, the Canada–U.S. difference in manufacturing employment goes back up to 0.21 but
remains imprecise.
In sum, it appears that Chinese import competition had a milder effect on manufacturing
sector employment in Canada relative to the U.S. We also saw milder effects on unemployment and the employment-to-population ratio, although the difference was not significant.
However, when comparing similar-looking cities, we found the differences became less distinct, but unfortunately, the instrument gets much weaker when we eliminate the smaller,
harder-to-compare Canadian cities.
It is worth contrasting these China shock results to the Bartik analysis. While the Bartik
instrument captures omnibus (typically positive) demand shocks, the China shock is more
specific in its focus on the (negative) employment effects of Chinese import competition. We
would expect to see similarities in the Canada–U.S. differences in the response to each of the
two shocks. In the first-stage Bartik results (panels A and B of table 2), we saw that the
coefficient on the Bartiks for the U.S. are nearly all larger than for Canada, although the
difference is only statistically significant in column (4). With the China shock we also saw
a stronger negative response to manufacturing employment for the U.S. relative to Canada.
Therefore, both sets of results suggest that local labor markets in the U.S. are slightly more
responsive to external demand shocks.

Conclusion

Our analysis provides a novel examination of labor market dynamics across two major
economies, the United States and Canada. While both countries have experienced similar
47

The 2SLS estimates for the common city size specification are reported in table A9 in the appendix.

27

structural transformations — such as declines in their manufacturing sectors and increased
import competition from China — they differ moderately in institutions, transfer generosity,
and immigration policy. Building upon other studies that examined the U.S. in isolation,
we provide a unique synthesis and careful side-by-side comparison with Canada. Studying
the U.S. and Canada in tandem also provides a unique opportunity to examine the external validity of prior research on the U.S. while learning more about local Canadian labor
markets.
In both countries, we see greater concentrations of income and inequality in larger cities,
but in the U.S. this association is considerably stronger. We also see more pronounced
patterns of urban sorting in Canada among its larger and more educated foreign-born population. In both countries, we observe persistent differences in earnings across cities. This is
true despite the fact Canadians have moved more towards high-wage areas, while Americans
have not.
We also find much in common across both countries when we examine the causal responses
to changes in local labor market conditions. In reaction to omnibus local labor demand shifts,
it appears that cities in the U.S. and Canada face similar upward-sloping supply curves in
terms of nominal wage changes. When we compare Canadian and U.S. cities that have
similar features, the U.S. supply curve looks slightly more elastic. The U.S. supply curve
also looks more elastic in terms of real wages, as housing-cost increases eroded nominal
wage gains more than in Canada. At the same time, Canadian cities saw immigrants react
more proportionally to demand shifts, even while they represent a heavier share of workers.
Relative to the U.S., university graduates in Canada were also more responsive than nongraduates. We also saw hints that U.S. employment rates were slightly more sensitive to
shifts in demand. This difference between the U.S. and Canada is more pronounced when
we examine how Chinese import competition reduced manufacturing employment.
The reasons for U.S.–Canada differences in local labor markets remain open questions:
they could be due to institutional or structural reasons our methods could not isolate. However, our results do suggest potential paths for future research. That immigrants in Canada
were more heavily urban and responsive to labor demand shifts may be due to Canada’s more
skill-oriented immigration policy. Because the emphasis on family reunification is weaker, it
would be interesting to see if immigrant enclaves in Canada predict population growth less

28

in Canada. More skilled immigrants may also provide greater positive spillovers by providing
skill complementarities that raise the wages of lower-skilled workers, or by establishing more
firms.
In Canada, the greater responsiveness to demand of nominal wages and university graduates, and the lower responsiveness of housing costs, are consistent with the country’s more
generous transfer policies. The link is still tenuous, and so it would be useful for future
researchers to collect transfer data at the individual level to assess how important these policies were in affecting employment and migration decisions. Indeed, many Americans want
to know if more generous transfers would protect American communities from future economic changes, while Canadians may want to know if market-oriented reforms may encourage
greater mobility to high-growth labor markets.

Notes: Panel A corresponds to the full sample data, observed in 1990, 2000, 2007, and 2011 with 264 metros in the U.S. and 82 in Canada.
In Panel A, Canadian metro areas are those with population greater than 15,000 in 1990; U.S. metro areas have population greater than
50,000 in 1999. Panel B uses common city size support where cities are chosen so that 1990 24-59 metro population size across countries
has a common support. Specifically, the minimum city size within each country is equal to the minimum city size in the U.S. and the
maximum city size within each country is equal to the maximum city size in Canada based on start of sample population. This yields
255 metros in the U.S. and 54 in Canada. See table A2 for the reweighting model specifications. Regressions are weighted by start of
period population 24-59. Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered at the state/province level and are in parentheses. *, **, ***
indicates statistical significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent levels, respectively.

Notes: The Census and CBP/ASM Bartik instruments are calculated using census data and County (US) Business Patterns data or
Canadian (CA) Business Patterns along with ASM data, respectively. All regressions include decal and region fixed effects; panel interacts
decadal fixed effects by country. For the full sample (columns 1 - 3), Canadian metro areas have population greater than 15,000 in
1990; U.S. metro areas have population greater than 50,000 in 1999. In the common city cize sample (columns 4 - 6), cities are chosen
so that 1990 24-59 city population size has a common support. Specifically, the minimum city size within each country is equal to the
minimum city size in the US and the maximum city size within each country is equal to the maximum city size in Canada based on start
of sample population. Metros are observed in 1990, 2000, 2007, and 2011. Regressions are weighted by start of period population 24-59.

Notes: See the notes for table 1. Sample consists of 264 metro areas in the United States and 82 in Canada observed in 1990, 2000, 2007, and 2011. Not all dependent variables
are available for all metro areas. The CBP/ASM Bartik instrument is calculated using County (US) Businesss Patterns or Canadian (CA) Business Patterns along with the
ASM data, respectively. The Bartik instruments are calculated using the start of sample as the base year. Within each panel, controls include decadal and census division/region
fixed effects. The p-value in the bottom row is associated with the null hypothesis of equality on the coefficients (∆ Log Employment) across the United States and Canada. See
the notes to table A1 for data sources and definitions. Regressions are weighted by start of period population 24-59. Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered at the
state/province level and are in parentheses. *, **, *** indicates statistical significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent levels, respectively.

Notes: See the notes for table 1. Panel A uses the full sample. In panel B, metros are chosen so that 1990 24-59 metro population size
has a common support. Specifically, the minimum metro size within each country is equal to the minimum metro size in the U.S. and
the maximum metro size within each country is equal to the maximum metro size in Canada using start of sample population. Metros
are observed in 1990, 2000, and 2007. In both columns, controls include decadal fixed effects and census division (column (1), U.S.)
or region (column (2), Canada) fixed effects. Predicted imports per workers are constructed using imports from Australia, Denmark,
Finland, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, and Switzerland (Other Countries). Imports from China to Other Countries for Canada
are adjusted using the 1990 relative manufacturing employment between the U.S. and Canada 0.1064. Regressions are weighted by start
of period population 24-59. Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered at the state/province level and are in parentheses. *, **,
*** indicates statistical significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent levels, respectively.

Notes: Sample consists of 264 metro areas in the United States and 82 in Canada observed in 1990, 2000, 2007, and 2011. All variables
(excluding unemployment insurance) are measured for the 24-59 working age population. Weekly wages and unemployment insurance
are in 2010 U.S. dollars, and weekly wages and manufacturing share are compiled using year t − 1 data. The unemployment insurance
is annual dollars per person, and unemployment insurance is not available for all metros in all time periods. Canadian metro areas are
those with population greater than 15,000 in 1990; U.S. metro areas have population greater than 50,000 in 1999. Averages and standard
deviations are weighted by start of period population. Data definitions are in section 3.

Data Appendix

B.1

University variable

We follow Katz and Murphy (1992), who create university (bachelor’s only) and high school
(12 years in the U.S. and 11 to 13 in Canada) equivalents. The measure adds workers with
less than a high school diploma to high school, and those with more than a bachelor’s to
university. Those in-between are divided with 2/3 to high school and 1/3 to university. Auxiliary regressions based on cross-sectional wage structures suggest that this is roughly correct,
although the “some-college” group may in fact be closer to high school for Canadians. There
are some additional challenges in classifying education. While the U.S. has a standardized
four years of high school and university, Canada has a system that varies more by province.
In Québec, secondary school ends at grade 11 and then students can continue on with Collège
d’Enseignement Général et Professionnel (CEGEP). In Ontario, until 1987, they had grade
13. Subsequently for students not planning on attending university, they ended high school
at grade 12, while students planning to go on to university took an additional year (Ontario
Academic Credit). After 2003, grade 12 is the last grade of high school for all students after
the OAC was phased out. We group education into five groups based on the highest level
of education achieved: less than high school, high school, a post-secondary degree below a
bachelor’s degree, a bachelor’s degree, and a graduate degree prior to defining our university
equivalent.
B.2

Housing Costs

We calculate housing costs from Census data on gross monthly rents or by imputing rents
from owned units, similar to Albouy et al. (2013). We control for housing characteristics —
namely the number of rooms, and age of structure — to construct a housing index based
only on location.
B.3
B.3.1

Other Data
UN Comtrade Database

Our trade data comes from the UN Comtrade database. From this dataset, we retain exports
from China to the U.S., Canada, and other developed countries at the 6-digit Harmonized
System product level. We aggregate the U.S. trade data to SIC 1987 3-digit level in 2007

56

U.S. dollars. The Canadian trade data are aggregated to the NAICS 1997 4-digit level in
2007 U.S. dollars to align with the industry classification of our Canadian CBP/ASM data.
B.3.2

Transfer Data

The Canadian Unemployment Insurance (UI)48 data come from the T1 Family File (T1FF).49
This contains city-level total UI as well as the number of tax filers collecting UI, so we are
able to create measures of UI per person. Similarly, we obtain unemployment insurance data
from the Bureau of Economic Analysis at the county level. We then convert these data to
the metro-area level of aggregation.
B.3.3

Union Data

For Canada, we calculate the city-level unionization rates from the Masterfile Labour Force
Survey (LFS). Unfortunately, questions about unionization were only added in 1997; therefore for 1991, we extrapolate backwards.50 We use two-year averages when calculating the
city average union rates (including the previous year) to ensure that we have accurate measures for the smaller cities. For the U.S., we obtain unionization rates from http://www.unionstats.com/,
which are calculated from the Current Population Survey (CPS).51
B.3.4

World KLEMS Data

We use World KLEMS data for Canada and the U.S. to provide an aggregate perspective on
labor dynamics in both countries during our study period.52 The KLEMS initiative uses a
harmonized growth accounting framework, which ensures that our Canada–U.S. comparisons
use variables that are measured using a common methodology.
48

In 1996, Unemployment Insurance was renamed Employment Insurance in Canada. Given that Unemployment Insurance (UI) is the term used in the U.S., we use it throughout the paper to avoid confusion.
49
For 2011, we downloaded the data directly from CANSIM, while for the preceding years, we purchased
tables from Statistics Canada.
50
We extrapolate from 1997–1998 to 1991 using provincial unionization rates, which we obtained from
the 1990 Labour Market Activity Survey with our 1997–1998 LFS cities rates and 1997–1998 LFS provincial
rates.
51
The LFS and CPS do not identify union rates for all of the cities we require. For Canada, we have union
rates for 71 of the 82 cities in 1990, 2001 and 2011 and 60 in 2007. For the U.S., of the 264 cities, we have
the union rates for 174 cities in 1990, 182 in 2011, and 194 in 2007 and 2011. We impute the union rates for
the remaining cities.
52
The Canada and U.S. data were downloaded from the World KLEMS website. Documentation for the
Canada and U.S. KLEMS datasets are provided in Gu (2012) and Ho et al. (2012), respectively.

57

B.4

SIC-E 1980 to NAICS 1997 Crosswalk

We structure our crosswalk using Statistics Canada’s concordance table between SIC-E 1980
and NAICS 1997.53 This concordance table provides a one-to-many mapping between SIC-E
1980 4-digit and NAICS 1997 6-digit codes. Unfortunately, there are no weights for the
one-to-many mappings, so the Statistics Canada concordance table cannot be directly used
to crosswalk the data.
We create the crosswalk weights using micro data from CDER’s T2-Longitudinal Employment Analysis Program (T2-LEAP). A limitation of the T2-LEAP data is that the NAICS
classification is limited to 4 digits. Accordingly, we collapse the original Statistics Canada’s
concordance table to a SIC-E 1980 3-digit to NAICS 1997 4-digit concordance table. We
leverage the fact that in the crossover year of 1997, T2-LEAP has both SIC-E 1980 and
NAICS 1997 industrial classification for many enterprises in the data. Using these data, we
calculate our weights as the share of SIC-E classified T2-LEAP employment in each NAICS
cell for all one-to-many mappings in the SIC-E 1980 3-digit to NAICS 1997 4-digit concordance table. One-to-one mappings in the concordance table are assigned a crosswalk weight
of 1.
