Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate Returns: Time-Varying Risk Regimes

NBER Working Paper No. 25714
March 2019, Revised May 2019
JEL No. E4,F31,F34,G15
ABSTRACT
We develop an empirical model of exchange rate returns, applied separately to samples of
developed (DM) and developing (EM) economies’ currencies against the dollar. Monetary policy
stance of the global central banks, measured via a natural-language-based approach, has a large
effect on exchange rate returns over the ensuing year, is closely linked to the VIX, and becomes
increasingly important in the post-crisis era. We document an important spillover effect:
monetary policy of the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the ECB is as important as Fed
policy in forecasting currency returns against the dollar. In the post-crisis era, a one standard
deviation increase in dovishness of all four central banks forecasts a 5.8% (4.0%) one-year excess
return of DM (EM) currencies. Furthermore, we find that the relation between a DM country’s
interest rate differential relative to the dollar (carry) and the future returns from investing in its
currency switches sign from the pre- to the post-crisis subperiod, while for EMs the carry variable
is never a significant predictor of returns. The high profit from the carry trade for EM currencies
reflects persistent country characteristics likely reflective of risk rather than the interest
differential per se. While measures of global monetary policy stance forecast exchange rate
returns against the dollar, they do not predict exchange rate returns against other base currencies.
Results regarding returns from carry, however, are insensitive to the choice of the base currency.
We construct a no-arbitrage pricing model which reconciles many of our empirical findings.

1. Introduction
How do central bank actions, and other changes in the economic environment, forecast
exchange rates, and through what channels? There is a huge literature in monetary economics
that posits a close connection between monetary policy and exchange rates because the exchange
rate is the foreign currency price of money, and central banks control the supply process that
creates money. In the 1970s, as part of the rational expectations revolution in macroeconomics,
economists developed models of exchange rate determination that saw exchange rates as
forward-looking asset prices affected by news, including news about monetary policy.1
Along with the conceptual changes in exchange rate modeling in the 1970s, the demise of
the Bretton Woods System of fixed exchange rates gave rise to a vast empirical literature
attempting to explain exchange rate changes. Some of that literature identifies challenges to
finding useful exchange rate forecasting variables, while other contributions attempt to capture
monetary policy news and translate it or other macroeconomic news into predictions about
exchange rate changes.2 At the same time, other approaches to studying exchange rates arose,
including market microstructure models,3 models that relate global capital flow shocks to
exchange rates, and empirical models that study deviations from uncovered interest rate parity
and the time variation in exchange rate risk premia.4

Some important contributions to the early theoretical literature include Dornbusch (1976, 1980, 1987), Mussa
(1982), and models that examined the forecasting of fixed exchange rate collapses, such as Flood and Marion
(1982), Flood and Garber (1984), and Flood and Hodrick (1986), to name only a few.

(1995) and Eichenbaum, Johannsen and Rebelo (2018) find persistent effects of monetary policy news on exchange
rate returns.

If the exchange rate market is efficient, then relevant news (e.g., changes in the stance of
monetary policy) should be incorporated immediately into the exchange rate, and future
exchange rate returns should only be forecastable by variables that capture compensation for
risk.5 Empirical models often focus on factor models that identify patterns of association that
capture risks that should be relevant for expected exchange rate returns.6 Factors identified in the
literature include the “dollar factor” – which captures changes in many exchange rates relative to
the dollar – and the “carry factor” – which exploits currency return variation related to interest
rate differences across countries. A carry factor trading strategy buys currencies with the highest
nominal interest rates and shorts currencies with the lowest nominal rates. Several other factors
have been identified in the literature, including the “dollar carry factor,” which considers the
returns to a contingent strategy that goes long (short) the dollar against a basket of all other
currencies when the dollar has the higher (lower) interest rate.
Despite the promising patterns of association that have been identified between exchange
rate factors and exchange rate returns, factor models do not identify the underlying economic
shocks that account for the importance of these factors.7 Specifically, they do not ask whether the
importance of factors reflects monetary policy risk. With few exceptions (see Rey 2015,
Eichenbaum, Johannsen and Rebelo 2018, and Taylor 2018 for a review), the recent finance and
economics literatures on exchange rates have not focused on measuring monetary policy’s

We use the term efficient to refer to both information efficiency, as well as to the absence of market frictions, such
as microstructure effects, slow moving capital, or barriers to arbitrage. Similarly, we use the term inefficient to refer
to both informational inefficiency, as well as to the presence of market frictions.

influence on future exchange rate returns. The absence of attention is striking, given the apparent
importance of recent monetary policy shocks for exchange rate changes, which has been
captured by analyses of low-frequency association between exchange rate movements and
quantitative easing (QE) policy actions (Taylor 2018), the exchange rate announcement effects
of quantitative easing policy (Chari, Stedman, and Lundblad 2018), and recent theoretical and
empirical work connecting monetary policy and financial market measures of risk (Drechsler,
Savov and Schnabl 2018, and Caldara and Herbst 2019).
Part of the challenge of modeling the effects of monetary policy on future exchange rates
is identifying a way of measuring policy consistently across countries and over time. Another
part of the challenge is disentangling the effects of monetary policy from other influences that
are relevant for exchange rates, which also may affect or be affected by monetary policy. In the
literature on modeling equity returns, researchers have converged on a list of several robust
forecasting variables that can be said to comprise a baseline model, which is taken into account
when identifying new forecasting variables (Calomiris and Mamaysky 2019). But in the
exchange rate literature, despite progress in identifying forecasters of returns by numerous
researchers, there is no apparent consensus regarding a comprehensive baseline model for
forecasting exchange rate returns. Any attempt to capture monetary policy influences must
account for and control for other influences on exchange rates that may be correlated with
monetary policy actions. Other sources of risk include influences on the real exchange rate,
which may vary over time in response to differences in productivity growth among countries (the
Balassa-Samuelson effect).8 Risks related to capital flows may also be relevant.

See Tica and Družić (2006) for a review of the evidence on the Balassa-Samuelson effect, which is sometimes
called the Harrod-Balassa-Samuelson effect.

In this paper, we first develop an empirical model, in the form of a panel regression, for
exchange rate returns which captures virtually all of the forecasting variables identified in the
literature. We then use this model to investigate the importance of monetary policy stance for
forecasting exchange rate returns for many developed market (DM) and emerging market (EM)
countries over the period 1996-2016. We do so for one-year exchange rate returns, using both insample and out-of-sample approaches to gauging the predictive importance of changes in
monetary policy stance. We find that monetary policy has played an important role in forecasting
exchange rate returns, even after controlling for other currency influences identified in the prior
literature. We identify important differences over time and between developed and emerging
economies. Furthermore, consistent with recent research on the dominance of the dollar in
international transactions and capital markets (Rey 2015, Gerko and Rey 2017, Gopinath and
Stein 2018a, 2018b, Jiang, Krishnamurthy and Lustig 2018a, 2018b), we show that the effect of
monetary policy on exchange rates is only present when the US dollar is used as the base
currency, suggesting that the US dollar plays a unique role in the global financial system.
One important new finding is a spillover effect in monetary policy. A tightening posture
of the major non-US central banks (the European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of England
(BOE), and the Bank of Japan (BOJ)) forecasts dollar appreciation relative to the currencies of
other DM and EM countries. The magnitude of the spillover effect is large. Furthermore, we find
that this spillover does not reflect market inefficiencies in reacting to news about predictable Fed
tightening in the future. As part of this analysis, we also estimate the extent to which central
banks’ actions have influenced each other, and how this has changed over time. We consider
whether this monetary policy spillover may reflect predictable reactions of the Fed to other
central banks’ actions (an explanation that would be inconsistent with the efficient market view
4

of exchange rate return predictability), and we are able to reject this explanation. We interpret
the role of monetary policy spillovers in forecasting exchange rates relative to the dollar as
capturing risk factors related to the global economy and financial system, rather than the risks
associated with the monetary policy actions of the major non-US central banks.9
We make use of a new indicator of monetary policy that is based on textual analysis of
monetary authority statements by the data provider Prattle.10 This approach enables us to employ
a common indicator of policy stance across countries and across monetary policy regimes. For
example, our measure combines, in one variable, changes that show up in some regimes as
interest rate movements and in other regimes as quantitative easing policy. The Prattle measure
of monetary policy, based on central bank policy statements, minutes, governor speeches and
press releases, is much broader than just a country’s short-term rate, and reflects a given central
bank’s assessment of the economic and market conditions in its sphere of influence. 11
We begin by connecting the Prattle measures of monetary policy to other variables, partly
to validate their usefulness, and partly as a way of understanding the likely connections between
monetary news and exchange rates. Interestingly, we find that Prattle not only is useful as a
forecaster of future interest rate changes, but is closely related to financial risk.12 This analysis
This interpretation is consistent with Gerko and Rey’s (2017) finding that interest rate changes attributable to US
monetary policy affect the UK economy, but that interest rate changes attributable to BOE monetary policy do not
affect the US economy. Therefore our own finding that BOE monetary policy affects currency returns against the
dollar is due to either (1) the possibility that BOE policy affects economic activity in all other countries, which
seems implausible, or (2) the fact that BOE monetary policy proxies for some unobservable risk factors.
10
We thank Prattle for sharing their Central Bank Analytics data with us. See www.prattle.co for more information.
11
We also note that many papers use proprietary text-based series obtained from third party data providers. To name
but a few: Heston and Sinha (2017) use Thomson-Reuters News Analytics proprietary sentiment measures; Asness
et al. (2017) use Ravenpack’s proprietary news sentiment measures; Nechio and Regan (2016) and Nechio and
Wilson (2016) use the same Prattle measures that we do.
12
Dossani (2018) uses a simpler measure of central bank tone to forecast currency volatility risk premia (the
difference between implied volatility for currency options and lagged realized volatility) and finds that hawkish tone
is associated with higher volatility risk premia. This is consistent with our findings if higher currency volatility risk
premia are associated with higher precautionary savings demands of other countries relative to the US, as discussed
in Section 7.

informs our interpretation of the changing relationships we observe among measures of risk,
monetary policy, and exchange rates. Financial traders often refer to changes in their taste for
risk in foreign exchange and other assets pre- and post-2007 as moving from a “risk-on” to a
“risk-off” posture. The idea seems to be that in the earlier period concerns about managing risk
were not as important. We find that measures of risk (exchange rate volatility and the VIX) are
more important in the post-crisis period for developed economies’ exchange rates. We also find
that monetary policy posture is more important in forecasting exchange rate returns in the post2007 period, which may reflect greater monetary policy activism in the post-2007 period, as well
as the fact that monetary policy responds more to risk (measured by the VIX) in that period.
We explore the relationship between exchange rate return forecasters, including monetary
policy indicators, and various previously identified return factors, including the dollar factor and
the carry factor. We decompose each predictive variable’s role into channels of influence related
to the dollar factor, the carry factor, or the idiosyncratic component of currency returns. Doing so
yields some surprising insights. In particular, we find that the impact of monetary policy news of
major central banks other than the Fed operates primarily through the dollar factor.
We also consider the empirical puzzle of the recent reversal of the role of the interest rate
differential as a positive predictor of the exchange rate, as documented in Hodrick and Tomunen
(2018). We find that this reversal reflects changes in the risk environment over time. Our finding
is similar to theirs – the early pattern of a positive association between a country’s current
interest rate (relative to others) and its future currency return is reversed after 2007. We find,
however, that this reversal is only evident among developed economies, and we provide
evidence indicating that the reversal could have reflected temporary savings differences among
developed countries during the recent crises in the U.S. and Europe.
6

As part of this analysis, we produce new evidence that the interest rate differential sort
for EM countries is largely a sort on country characteristics. Once we control for those
characteristics, the carry variable, the difference between a foreign and domestic short-term rate,
does not significantly forecast currency returns in our panel analysis, even though the EM carry
trade has been consistently profitable. On the other hand, the carry variable for DM countries
works both as a sorting variable and as a predictor in a panel regression. This suggests that the
EM and DM currency carry trades may reflect different underlying mechanisms, and sheds light
on why the DM, but not the EM, carry trade stopped “working” after the financial crisis.
We construct a theoretical model along the lines of Bekaert (1996), Bansal (1997), and
Backus et al. (2001) that links exchange rate returns and risks to interpret the empirical patterns
we identify. Our model shows how country-specific and global variation in the risk environment
can explain changes in the coefficients we observe in our forecasting model. Furthermore, we
show that the different empirical patterns we observe for the carry trade can be seen as reflecting
three alternative risk regimes, which we interpret as reflecting the difference between
asynchronous and synchronous global economic cycles. Specifically, we posit that when foreign
countries and the US have asynchronous economic cycles, low interest rate differentials are
associated with low expected returns on the foreign currency. This leads to the usual positive
correlation between interest rate differentials and currency returns. This pattern is robustly found
for emerging market countries (EMs) and for developed countries (DMs) in the early subperiod
of our sample. In the later subperiod, the result flips for DMs, and we speculate that this flip
reflects a newly synchronous global economic cycle. When the foreign country and the US are
both in a recession, their interest rate differential can move in the opposite direction of the

7

currency expected return if their marginal utilities of consumption have different elasticities to
the economic cycle than do their precautionary savings demands.
While we do not structurally model monetary policy, our theoretical analysis hints at a
deep connection between interest rate differentials and the global economic cycle, which is
connected to monetary policy. What do our findings have to say about the extent to which the
relationship between carry and exchange rate returns reflects monetary policy influences? First,
an examination of the effects of monetary policy on currency returns cannot ignore interest rate
differentials, which capture both differences across countries in monetary policy and other
information about the state of the global economic cycle. Second, our evidence is consistent
with viewing anticipated exchange rate returns as compensation for economic risk, and because
risk is reflected in both carry and our Prattle monetary policy measures both carry and Prattle
measures are important forecasters of currency returns.13 Finally, our evidence is consistent with
the idea that monetary policy stances of the three major non-US central banks capture
information about the global economy and its risks, which affects the global demand for dollars
as a reserve currency. Similarly to our explanation for the carry reversal in Section 7, this is the
most likely explanation for our monetary policy spillover effects, i.e., the relevance of ECB, BOJ
and BOE policies for dollar exchange rates against other currencies, and the importance of the
dollar factor as the channel through which those policies affect exchange rates.
Section 2 describes our empirical model and defines the variables we include in our
study. We also estimate rolling elastic net regressions to investigate whether all the forecasting
variables which we include in our model are justified on statistical grounds, and we find that

The interest rate differential relative to the base currency forecasts excess currency returns both when the dollar is
used as the base currency and when other hard currencies are used as the base.
13

8

none of the variables can be excluded. Section 3 discusses the Prattle data on central bank policy
in detail, and analyzes its usefulness as a gauge of monetary policy The Prattle measures are not
just useful for forecasting future interest rates. They also reflect and predict changes in financial
risk (as measured by the VIX), which suggests that their influence on exchange rates may
contain both news about policy actions and news about the state of the economy. Our other data
sources are described in the Online Appendix.
Section 4 reports in-sample estimates for our main endogenous variable, twelve-monthahead returns, which are presented separately for developed and emerging economies (which
differ in some important respects). Our model explains a large percentage of the variation in
future returns, and many variables’ coefficient estimates are highly statistically significant. The
Prattle measures of central bank policies work well as forecasters of currency returns, especially
in the post-crisis period. Section 5 discusses the puzzle of the reversal of the carry variable
(foreign vs US interest rate differential) as an exchange rate predictor in DMs, and shows that
there is substantial heterogeneity among DM countries in the extent of this reversal, which is
related to risk. Section 6 relates the results of Section 4 to the literature on exchange rate factors.
Here we decompose currency predictability into two parts: factor-related and idiosyncratic
predictions, making use of the recent work on currency factor models (e.g., Aloosh and Bekaert
2019 and Verdelhan 2018). Section 7 shows that a simple, and quite general, no-arbitrage
pricing model is able to reconcile several of the important features of time-varying risk pricing,
as well as the differences in the currency carry trade identified in our empirical work. In
particular, we show that the model leads to a linear empirical specification in which returns
depend on domestic, foreign, and global factors, thus justifying our main empirical setup, and
providing interpretations of our results. Section 8 concludes.
9

2. Empirical Model Specification
Table 1 lists the regressors used in our exchange rate forecasting model, and data sources
are discussed in the Online Appendix. Table 4 reports summary statistics. Section 4’s discussion
of the results explains the economic interpretations we attach to each of the variables included in
the forecasting model, and we avoid repetition of that discussion here. The theoretical and
empirical literatures on exchange rate determination indicate that monetary policy is only one of
many influences that must be captured in any empirical model of exchange rate returns. Our
vector of characteristics reflects a variety of factors, including monetary policy, variables that
measure influences on real exchange rates and the mean reversion in the latter over time, capital
account influences, time variation in volatility of exchange rate returns and the volatility of other
asset returns, and momentum of exchange rate returns. We discuss in Section 2.1 our
methodology for determining that all of our forecasting variables are indeed statistically relevant.
The dependent variable in our model is returns to investing in a foreign currency. In
theory, forecasters of returns should capture risks that are priced by the market, as we explain
more fully in Section 7. Our interpretation of our regression model, therefore, is that the
regressors we include are state variables that capture risks that are priced by the market.
Although we interpret our results from the perspective of an equilibrium model under efficient
markets, we also consider alternative interpretations of some of our findings that may reflect
market inefficiencies that result in predictable changes in exchange rates that reflect delayed
market adjustment to news rather than compensation for risk.14

14

Exchange rates may not fully adjust to news immediately, as a result of limits to market efficiency (see Duffie
2010, Gromb and Vayanos 2010, and Greenwood, Hanson and Liao 2018), and, if so, some of forecasted returns
may reflect slow responses to information. However, we find that exchange rate returns forecastability is much
greater for the one-year period we analyze than for shorter periods (e.g., a one-month period). Our one-year
forecasts are unlikely to be driven by lagged responses to news, and are more likely to reflect expected returns due

10

We measure exchange rates as the US dollar price of a foreign currency. Let 𝑆𝑡 be the
dollar price of a unit of foreign currency, and let 𝑦𝑡 and 𝑦𝑡∗ be the US and foreign short-term rates
quoted in monthly terms. The return to a dollar investor of buying a unit of foreign currency and
∗

holding it for one month is 𝑆𝑡+1 𝑒 𝑦𝑡 /𝑆𝑡 . In continuously compounded terms this is 𝑠𝑡+1 − 𝑠𝑡 +
𝑦𝑡∗ , where we denote logs with lower case letters. The excess return of this strategy above the
(𝐴)

US short-term rate is 𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 = 𝑠𝑡+1 − 𝑠𝑡 + 𝑦𝑡∗ − 𝑦𝑡 . Now consider committing 𝑆𝑡 dollars of
capital to buy one unit of foreign currency one month forward and then sell it immediately at
𝑆𝑡+1. The return from this strategy is (𝑆𝑡+1 − 𝐹𝑡 )/𝑆𝑡 where 𝐹𝑡 is the one-month ahead forward
price at time t. The first order approximation of this return is given by15
𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 ≈ 𝑠𝑡+1 − 𝑓𝑡 .

(1)

Covered interest parity is a no-arbitrage condition that requires the returns from these two
strategies to be equal, 16 i.e. 𝑟𝑥 = 𝑟𝑥 (𝐴) , which occurs when 𝑓𝑡 − 𝑠𝑡 = 𝑦𝑡 − 𝑦𝑡∗ . The higher the
foreign rate relative to the domestic rate, the lower the forward price of the foreign currency
relative to the spot price.
Our one month return measure ret1m is 𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 from (1). Assuming CIP holds, this equals
the return of a one-month investment into the foreign currency, financed by borrowing at the US
one-month rate. The twelve-month lagged return is defined as 𝑟𝑒𝑡12𝑚𝑡 = ∏11
𝑖=0(1 + 𝑟𝑥𝑡−𝑖 ) − 1.
The regressions we estimate take the general form:

𝑟𝑒𝑡12𝑚𝑡+12 = 𝑎𝑖 + 𝜷′ 𝑿𝑡 + 𝜖𝑖,𝑡+ℎ ,

(2)

to risk exposures. Nevertheless, in our empirical discussion we note how some of our results could be interpreted
from this alternative perspective.
This follows from a first-order Taylor series expansion of exp(𝑠𝑡+1 − 𝑠𝑡 ) − exp(𝑓𝑡 − 𝑠𝑡 ).
We discuss later how the failure of CIP, documented in Du, Tepper, and Verdelhan (2018), Jiang, Krishnamurthy,
and Lustig (2018a, 2018b), and Andersen, Duffie and Song (2019), affects our results.

elements of 𝑿𝑡 , two receive particular attention in our analysis. First, we study how the Prattle
measures of central bank communications helps to forecast returns. We discuss the Prattle
measure in detail below. Second, we focus on the forecasting ability of the short-term interest
rate differential, carry, between the foreign market and the US. Our carry variable is defined as

𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑦𝑡 ≡ − log

where the second equality follows from CIP.
2.1 Model Selection
Because the extant literature on currency forecasting has identified many potential
predictors of currency returns, our list of potential right-hand side variables is rather long.17 Our
approach to model selection is able to remove variables that are redundant. Only variables that
capture influences that are not spanned by the other variables are retained. Because the variables
we include in our initial model all have justifications on economic grounds, we hesitate to
remove any explanatory variable (for fear of an omitted variable bias) unless that variable can be
shown to be not useful statistically.
When over-fitting is a concern, the typical solution is to penalize coefficient estimates by
shrinking their absolute value based on an objective function that weighs each coefficient’s
contribution to explanatory power (which receives a positive weight) against the magnitude of
that coefficient (which receives a negative weight). We use the elastic net estimator
(implemented in the glmnet package of Hastie and Qian 2016), which combines the least

We have 21 explanatory variables, though some variables, such as our lagged returns variables, are simply the
same variable measured over multiple horizons.
17

12

absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression, introduced by Tibshirani (1996),
with a ridge regression, to ameliorate this over-fitting problem.
In our panel setting, we estimate rolling five-year regressions using the elastic net
objective function, which is given by
min

′
∑(𝑧𝑖,𝑡 − 𝑥𝑖,𝑡−1
𝛽) + 𝜆(𝛼‖𝛽‖1 + (1 − 𝛼)‖𝛽‖22 /2)

𝑖,𝑡

where N is the total number of observations in the regression, 𝑧𝑖,𝑡 is the response variable (12month forward returns in our case), 𝑥𝑖,𝑡−1 is a vector of the predictors, ‖𝛽‖1 is the L1-norm of
the coefficients (the sum of the absolute values of the 𝛽 vector) and ‖𝛽‖22 is the L2-norm squared
(the sum of the squares of the 𝛽 coefficients).18 We include country fixed effects by constructing
demeaned z’s and x’s within each country grouping – so a constant in the above regression is not
necessary. The choice of λ determines the penalty applied to the blended L1- and L2-norms of
the coefficients. This parameter is selected in each 60-month window to minimize the crossvalidation error. We set 𝛼 = 1, i.e., the lasso objective, though other choices of 𝛼 have little
effect on the qualitative behavior of the model. Section 4.4 summarizes our empirical estimates
of the elastic net model and explains our variable selection choices.

3. Prattle as a Measure of Central Banks’ Policy Stance
In theory, under efficient markets, exchange rate returns should react to the (lagged)
policy stance of monetary authorities only if it informs the market about risks that require
compensation through higher expected returns. The stance of monetary policy contains

One important subtlety in the out-of-sample estimation for 12-month ahead returns is to truncate the measured 12month ahead outcomes in the pre time-(t+1) estimation window to ensure that they do not overlap with the t+1
through t+12 outcome that we are trying to forecast out-of-sample. This is needed in our root mean-squared error
analysis, which is discussed in the Online Appendix.

information about risk either because the monetary authority’s actions reflect risks exogenous to
its actions, or because the monetary authority creates or mitigates risks through its actions.
Statements or actions related to monetary policy by central banks potentially contain both
elements (Drechsler, Savov and Schnabl 2018, Caldara and Herbst 2019). Using changes in
interest rates to measure monetary policy actions is common in macroeconomics, but there is
more to monetary policy than interest rate changes. Recent monetary policy at the zero interest
rate lower bound entailed other actions: quantitative easing to grow the central bank’s balance
sheet, forward guidance that attempts to commit to future interest rate changes beyond the
present, or other attempts to provide commitments that affect markets, such as the “Greenspan
put” (an implicit commitment to try to prevent large stock market downturns), or Mario Draghi’s
commitment to do “whatever it takes” to stabilize the euro zone. A major challenge of mapping
from monetary policy stance to exchange rate returns is measuring ex ante monetary policy
stance, as distinct from observed ex post changes in the instruments of policy themselves.
This is particularly challenging when the instruments of policy change over time. Even if
changes in the policy stance could be quantified by modeling expected changes in the
instruments of policy, what is one to do when the monetary authority changes from using an
interest rate as its policy instrument to using the growth of its liabilities? How can one construct
a comparable measure over time that captures consistently the variety of changes in various
instruments over time?
The Prattle measure of a central bank’s policy stance addresses both of these challenges.
It uses the statements of central bankers – including press releases, speeches of policy makers,
minutes of their meetings, and other communications – to capture the ex ante stance of policy,
which is expressed in a single variable that is centered at zero with a standard deviation of one in

14

the training window. High values are “hawkish,” meaning that they imply future changes in
policy that are contractionary, while low values are “dovish,” meaning that they imply future
changes in policy that are accommodative. Prattle identifies combinations of words (linguistic
patterns) that elicit market responses in its training period, and then uses those combinations in
the out-of-sample period as real-time measures of monetary policy stance.19
Word combinations are not selected by Prattle based on any a priori views, but are
entirely dictated by observed market reactions during the training period. Prattle finds that it is
useful to take account of the relative frequency of the use of linguistic patterns, the context in
which the pattern appears, and the novelty of that context, not just the presence or absence of
word combinations. After the training window for each central bank, Prattle updates its
linguistic mapping to take into account new words and phrases that enter the vernacular.
However, the company has told us that the historical Prattle scores we have are the ones that
were available at the time, and do not reflect model updates that took place afterwards. For more
details on the Prattle text measure, including comparisons to other Fed sentiment measures, see
Prattle (2016), Nechio and Regan (2016), and Nechio and Wilson (2016).20
Thus, Prattle offers a single measure of monetary policy stance that can be used across
countries and across different monetary policy regimes where different monetary policy

According to the company: The training period for the Fed is 1998-2005, for the ECB it is 2004-2012, for the
Bank of England it is from 2000-2008, and for the Bank of Japan it is from 2006-2013. Our post-crisis results for the
Fed are both stronger than in the earlier subperiod and are completely out-of-sample. For the other banks, our preand post-crisis windows overlap with the training window. The models are trained to identify central bank language
with market outcomes, where the latter are measured using a short- and long-dated bond, the trade weighted
currency and the domestic stock index. In our forecasting regressions we forecast exchange rates against the dollar,
which were not included in the security training set for the ex-Fed currencies. Furthermore, in results where we use
the euro, pound or yen as the base currency (which do reflect the security training set), the forecasting power of the
Prattle measure becomes much weaker. Hence, we do not believe in-sample bias is a major cause for concern.
20
For example, Nechio and Regan (2016) show that the median Prattle score of speeches made by FOMC
participants is positively correlated with the median medium-term interest rate forecast made by the same FOMC
participants.

instruments are employed. We find that the Prattle score is best seen as a forward-looking
measure of changes in central bank policy. As Table 2 shows, Prattle makes use of six categories
of communications: monetary policy communications, an unlabeled category, speeches, other
publications, minutes, and official press statements. We exclude from our Prattle measure the
unlabeled category and the other publications category, as these consist of idiosyncratic research
papers and other publications that we believe are not news and whose coverage is spotty.
The monthly Prattle series for seventeen central banks are displayed in Figure A1 in the
Online Appendix, along with one series we constructed for use in our empirical work, CBexFed,
which combines information about more than one central bank (it is an average of the monthly
Prattle scores for the ECB, BOE and BOJ). To construct the monthly Prattle score for a given
central bank, we first calculate the within-day average Prattle scores, and then use days with at
least one Prattle event to compute the monthly average. As Figure A1 shows, the coverage of
Prattle has grown over time and now includes ten developed economies (Australia, Canada,
Eurozone, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the U.K, the U.S.) and seven
emerging economies (Brazil, India, Israel, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, and Turkey). As
Figure A2 shows, coverage improved markedly after 2000. Online Appendix Figure A3 maps the
full-sample correlations across the various central bank Prattle scores using an ordered
correlation matrix which locates central banks according to the similarity in the correlations.
In our empirical work, we show that Prattle measures are useful for forecasting exchange
rate returns, but before turning to that analysis, we report evidence examining the Prattle
measures of the four major central banks, the Fed, ECB, BOE and BOJ, from three other
perspectives, which validate Prattle as a measure of monetary policy. First, to validate Prattle’s
information content as a measure of important monetary policy news (based on a priori

16

identification of times of significant changes in the stance of policy), we examine whether Prattle
scores track changes around quantitative easing announcements, and whether those
announcements coincide with changes in 10-year bond yields. Second, we examine the dynamic
relationship between Prattle scores and short-term interest rates using a variety of approaches:
simple bivariate VARs, trivariate VARs that also include the VIX, and via connecting changes in
Fed Fund futures (as in Bernanke and Kuttner 2005) and in two-year interest rates (as in Hanson
and Stein 2015) around policy announcement dates to the Prattle scores associated with those
announcements. Third, we examine whether Prattle and short-term interest rates display similar
medium-term responses to changes in certain macroeconomic variables. In most of our analysis,
we divide our sample into two subperiods, which are split at the end of 2006.
The results for the quantitative easing announcements are reported in Table 3. We use the
QE events identified by Fawley and Neeley (2013), which cover announcements by the Bank of
England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Federal Reserve. There are a
total of 63 events. The events are associated with negative Prattle scores, as one would expect,
except for the ECB announcements which display Prattle scores that are neutral on average.
Interest rate changes on announcement days for 10-year bonds are negative, again with the
exception of bund responses to the ECB, which average about positive 3 basis points. One
interpretation of the different reactions to the ECB is that its quantitative easing policy was
targeted at alleviating market crisis concerns by supporting bond yields of the peripheral
Eurozone countries, rather than achieving a monetary policy objective per se, and that such
support reduced safe-haven demand for bunds. That interpretation is consistent with other
research that has found that ECB announcements affected markets with very long lags (often
months), and those effects were not uniform in their incidence within the Eurozone, reflecting

17

differences in country circumstances that mattered for the impact of the announcements
(Mamaysky 2018, Fendel and Neugebauer 2018, Gholampour and van Wincoop 2017). From
that perspective it is not surprising that the ECB is an outlier in Table 3.
With regard to exchange rate changes, we see that for the Fed and the Bank of England,
QE announcements were associated with a large same-day currency depreciation. The Bank of
Japan did not yet engage in meaningful QE (it did so in earnest starting in 2014), while the
ECB’s policy goals were different as has already been argued. Therefore, the lack of
depreciation for these currencies is not surprising. We discuss the effect of monetary policy on
exchange rates in much greater detail in Section 4. Though anecdotal, the results of Table 3
support the idea that Prattle scores for the big four central banks convey relevant information
about their monetary policy.
We graph the relationship between Prattle and short-term interest rates in Figure 1.21
Because Prattle is a measure of prospective change in policy, we cumulate Prattle changes in the
figure and show cumulative change in Prattle against the short-term interest rate. It is clear
visually that Prattle sometimes anticipated changes in interest rates, but it is also clear that the
two series are not extremely highly correlated. Many of the intentions reflected in Prattle are not
clearly realized in short-term interest rates at some fixed lag, and similarly many of the
realizations in short-term interest rates are not anticipated by Prattle. Those patterns are apparent
prior to the zero-lower-bound periods depicted in the figure, which begins in Japan in the late
1990s, and in the other three areas after the 2008 crisis.
To examine these relationships more formally, we begin with bivariate VARs, reported in
Online Appendix Figures A12 through A15. In most cases, Prattle and the short-term interest rate
The average monthly Prattle score for the Bank of England is positive, and therefore we detrend the cumulative
Prattle series for the Bank of England. All other series are not detrended.
21

18

are not statistically significant forecasters of one another (the short-term interest rate does
forecast Prattle positively for the Bank of Japan in the early subperiod, as shown in Figure A15).
We now turn to examine the relationships among Prattle, short-term interest rates and
financial risk in trivariate VARs that include the VIX as the measure of risk (Figures 2 and 3 and
Online Appendix Figures A17-A18).22 As Figure A16 shows, the VIX is an important proxy for
risk in all the relevant regions, as it is highly correlated with local measures of implied volatility
in Europe, the UK and Japan. Those local measures are only available late in the sample period,
so to improve coverage, we employ the VIX as the measure of financial risk in all four sets of
trivariate VARs.23
Including VIX in the model strengthens the magnitude and significance of the impulse
response functions of Prattle on the short-term rate and vice versa. For the Fed, in the early
subperiod, Prattle is now a significant forecaster of the short-term rate (Figure 2). For the Fed,
the ECB, and the Bank of England, in the late subperiod, the short-term rate forecasts Prattle.
The clearest and most consistent pattern visible in Figures 2 and 3, and A17-A18,
however, is the late period mutual importance of Prattle and VIX as negative forecasters of each
other for the Fed, the ECB and the BOE. Interestingly, that pattern is also visible for the Fed in
the early period, but not for the ECB or the BOE. For the ECB in the early period, Prattle is a
positive forecaster of VIX, and VIX shocks have a weakly positive effect on Prattle. For the
BOE in the early period, the two series do not forecast one another.

See also Bekaert, Hoerova, and Lo Duca (2013) and Rey (2015) for investigations of the relationship of the riskpremium and expected volatility components of the VIX and their relationship to monetary policy.
23
In results not reported here, we also included the ratio of local stock index market-to-book value in place of VIX.
Results were similar, although opposite in sign (i.e., shocks and responses associated with VIX are opposite to those
observed for market-to-book value).
22

19

We interpret the early period connections between Fed Prattle and VIX as indicative of a
so-called “Greenspan put” in Fed monetary policy during the early period: Rising risk (shocks to
VIX) led the Fed to take a more accommodative stance.24 Similarly, assuming that the Fed had
private information about risk, a Greenspan put policy would also imply that hawkish shocks to
Fed Prattle may have signaled lower future risk. Interestingly, the other major central banks’
monetary policy stances display no such Greenspan-put connection in the early period. Indeed,
the fact that tightening by the ECB predicts a rise in the VIX suggests what one would expect if
monetary policy was not responding to the VIX: exogenous tightening should have a negative
effect on the market. But in the late period, as central banks’ main focus shifted to crisismanagement, the ECB and BOE became converts to the Greenspan-put and the relationship
between their Prattle scores and the VIX became similar to that of the Fed.
This analysis illustrates two points that are of general importance for our modeling of
exchange rate returns. First, Prattle measures the thinking of central bankers, and is not just (or
even mainly) a forecaster of short-term interest rate changes. Second, if market pricing was less
reflective of risk in the early “risk-on” period, that may imply that measures that capture risk
(including Fed Prattle) may differ in importance as forecasters of exchange rates across
subperiods. Indeed, as we will show, that is the case; the Fed Prattle measure is much more
important for forecasting exchange rate returns in the later period than in the early one, as also
are the VIX and exchange rate volatility measures for DM currencies (exchange rate volatility
was already significant for EMs in the early subperiod). Time variation in risk, and variation in
the way that risk affects exchange rate pricing, are important themes to which we will return.

24

Cieslak and Vissing-Jorgensen (2018) argue that negative stock returns are the best predictors of Fed actions.

20

Monetary policy surprises are typically measured in the literature via a change in shortterm interest rates around a central bank’s policy decisions. To check that Prattle doesn’t simply
reflect information which is already available from interest rate markets, we matched changes in
Fed Funds futures (following Bernanke and Kuttner 2005) and in two-year interest rates
(following Hanson and Stein 2015) in three-day windows around FOMC announcements with
the Prattle score of the same FOMC announcements. We also examined the two-year-rate-Prattle
relationship for ECB, Bank of England and Bank of Japan policy announcements. In all cases,
which are reported in the Online Appendix Table A11, we find only weak association between
the stance of monetary policy as measured by Prattle and these conventionally used measures of
monetary policy that focus on interest rate changes. This reinforces our findings from the VARs
that Prattle scores are related to, but by no means spanned by, changes in interest rates.25
We complete our validation analysis of Prattle by comparing how macroeconomic
variables forecast annual changes in Prattle with how those same variables forecast annual
changes in short-term interest rates. Table A1 (Panel A) in the Online Appendix reports time
series results for each of the four regions, showing how the twelve-month forward short-term
interest rate changes respond to past change in GDP growth and inflation. Panel B of Table A1
expands the list of macroeconomic forecasting variables to include the VIX, net foreign assets as
a fraction of GDP (nfa), and foreign reserves as a fraction of GDP (res_GDP). Panels A and B of
Table A2 produce similar regressions, but with the next twelve-month average Prattle scores of
each central bank as the dependent variable. In all four panels of Tables A1 and A2, we divide
the sample into early and late subperiods.

We also note that Prattle scores are available at a much higher frequency than central bank policy announcements
because the former encompass a much broader set of central bank communications.
25

21

We emphasize two points from Tables A1 and A2. First, average Prattle and the change
in the short-term rate display similar R-squareds and are both predicted by measures of prior
macroeconomic and financial conditions, which validates Prattle as responsive to traditional
drivers of monetary policy change. Second, it is interesting to note from a comparison of the Rsquareds in Panels A and B of the two tables that both Prattle and the change in the short-term
rate are influenced more by measures of international capital and reserve positions and VIX than
by domestic GDP growth and inflation. This is consistent with Taylor’s (2018) view that during
both the early and late sample subperiods central banks were responding to variables outside the
narrow confines of the Taylor Rule.
Our overarching conclusion from this analysis of Prattle is that Prattle scores are a valid
measure of monetary policy stance, and not just a forecast of the short-term interest rate.
Furthermore, Prattle scores have differing import for central bank actions across central banks
and over time. Prattle scores respond to variables that central banks have been known to target,
and predict changes in variables that monetary policy should be relevant for, but changes in
Prattle are not closely related to changes in short-term interest rates. Prattle scores have broader
meaning as measures of policy stance, capturing central bankers’ views of the state of the
economy and especially the risk of the financial system, and they do so in ways that vary across
subperiods and across central banks. We make use of these insights in our interpretations of the
role of Prattle as an exchange rate return forecaster below.

4. Empirical Results
We report regression results forecasting twelve month-ahead exchange rate returns (12month returns) separately for our sample of 10 DM countries and our sample of 25 EM countries

22

in Tables 5 and 6. The list of countries used in our analysis appears in Table 11. We report
results for the entire 1996-2016 period, as well as for the two subperiods divided at November
2006. We refer to these subperiods as the pre-crisis and post-crisis periods.
Table 5 reports results for 12-month returns for DM countries, which are reported for two
versions of our model. Similar regressions are reported in Table 6 for EMs. Columns (1)-(3)
present what we term the Base model, for the whole period and each subperiod. It excludes any
information about the Prattle scores of the major global central banks, which are captured in
Columns (4)-(5), which report results for subperiods only (given that we reject stability of
coefficients across subperiods). In the Column (1)-(3) results, of course, monetary policy’s
influence still is present in the model through the way monetary policy affects each of the
forecasting variables, most obviously the interest rate variables: carry, exFedRate, and T-bill.
However, these interest rate variables reflect a combination of real economic conditions and
endogenous monetary policy actions and cannot be interpreted as entirely or even mainly
reflecting monetary policy, despite the presence of the many control variables that capture real
growth and other aspects of the economic environment.
It is useful to categorize our regressors into four groups of variables. First, we include
measures that capture dynamic adjustment and changes in measures of financial risk: lagged onemonth and twelve-month returns, lagged one-month and twelve-month exchange rate returns
volatility, VIX, and the two variables that capture long-run real exchange rate mean reversion –
logRSpotPos and logRSpotNeg.26 Second, we include capital account and reserve balance
variables (nfa and res_GDP). Third, we include variables that capture influences related to real

Menkhoff et al. (2016) find that a five-year change in the real exchange rate forecasts currency returns. Our
logRSpotPos captures the change when it is positive, and logRSpotNeg captures the change when it is negative. We
therefore allow for an asymmetric response of exchange rates to log real exchange rate changes. Also, Eichenbaum,
Johannsen and Rebelo (2018) show that real exchange rates forecast changes in nominal exchange rates.
26

23

exchange rate changes, including recent GDP growth and price inflation in the subject county,
the US, and the average of the geographic areas related to the big three non-US central banks
(cpiYOY, gdprYOY, exFedCpiYOY, cpiYOYUS, exFedGdprYOY, and gdprYOYUS). Finally, we
include variables related to monetary policy stance and interest rates, where we employ
alternative specifications that include different variables capturing monetary policy (carry,
exFedRate, T-bill, treas_basis, Fed, and CBexFed). 27
A few of the coefficient results are stable across the various estimation periods and
across the two samples of countries. The coefficient on gdprYOY is consistently positive and
sometimes statistically significant (mainly for EMs). Under efficient markets, as we discuss
further in Section 7, we interpret this as reflecting information about country-specific risks that
varies with lagged GDP growth. Alternatively, under inefficient markets, slow adjustment to
news could explain this coefficient. To the extent that real growth reflects news about
productivity growth, according to the Balassa-Samuelson effect, real growth news should be
associated with real exchange rate appreciation. The coefficient on cpiYOY is consistently
positive and often statistically significant in both DMs and EMs, and the coefficients on
cpiYOYUS and gdprYOYUS are generally negative and when they are negative, they are often
statistically significant. Under inefficient markets, one could interpret these coefficients as
indicating that nominal exchange rates adjust to real exchange rate shocks with considerable
lags, and that some of the change in real exchange rates is apparent first in price indexes, which
is why they forecast future currency returns. Note that these patterns are not consistent with an

In results not reported here, we also include ownCB (the Prattle score of the subject country’s central bank) in the
model. Given the limited coverage of Prattle, however, this results in a severely diminished sample. For EMs, the
sample is only 10 percent of the panel in Table 6 for the early period, and about 20 percent for the later subperiod.
For DMs, the coverage is better, but we still lose about 20 percent of our observations. For DMs, ownCB displays a
positive and highly statistically significant effect, with a coefficient of 1.14. For EMs, the coefficient is 0.122 and
not statistically significant.
27

24

inefficient markets view that also posits real exchange rate constancy (so-called Purchasing
Power Parity). If real exchange rates were constant and if nominal exchange rates reacted with a
lag to news contained in price indexes, then increases in domestic prices in the subject country
would forecast nominal exchange rate depreciation (i.e., the dollar price of subject country
currency should fall), and increases in foreign (i.e. dollar) prices would forecast nominal
exchange rate appreciation of the subject country; but the opposite is true in our regressions.
We interpret the role of exFedCpiYOY in our model as a proxy for global, non-US
inflation, which may capture some relevant variation in global risk. The coefficient on
exFedCpiYOY is positive when it is significant for DMs, but it is less significant and less
consistent in sign for EMs. The coefficient on exFedGdprYOY is generally positive when it is
significant for both DMs and EMs.
We find evidence of long-term mean reversion in real exchange rates for both DMs and
EMs. The coefficients on logRSpotNeg and logRSpotPos are negative when they are significant
for both DMs and EMs.
The coefficient on nfa in DMs switches from positive significant to statistically zero
across subperiods. In EMs, it is statistically zero consistently. In DMs, the coefficient on
res_GDP is negative and significant in the early subperiod, but small and statistically
insignificant in the later subperiod once we include the Prattle variables. In EMs, it is statistically
zero in the early subperiod, and positive and somewhat significant in the later subperiod.
For both DMs and EMs, the coefficient on treas_basis flips from positive to negative in
the two subperiods. Its inclusion adds slightly to the adjusted R-squared (often improving it by
one or two percentage points) and generally does not affect the other variables in the regression,
with the exception of T-bill. The coefficient on T-bill switches from insignificant in the first

25

subperiod to positive significant in the second subperiod, and that is true for both DMs and EMs.
In results that omit treas_basis, which is negatively correlated with T-bill (correlation of -37%),
the coefficient on T-bill is negative significant in the early period for both DMs and EMs. One
interpretation of that result is that in the early subperiod variation in the US interest rate reflects
monetary policy actions, while during much of the second subperiod the interest rate was
essentially zero, and small upticks in the interest rate mainly may have reflected other factors
that were positive influences on aggregate demand. In Section 7, we discuss why sources of
variation in aggregate demand may contain relevant information about exchange rate risk.
Most of the coefficient changes reported above across subperiods are consistent between
the specification reported in Columns (1)-(3) and the one in Columns (4)-(5). In other words,
coefficient changes are not simply the result of taking account of the existence of a monetary
policy regime change (as in Columns (4)-(5)) or of the stance of monetary policy. This indicates
that there is a fundamental shift in economic structure across subperiods that is relevant for
exchange rates.
The differences in estimates across time and across groups of countries leads us to
conclude that EMs and DMs should be modeled separately, and that subperiods should be
modeled separately. We provide additional evidence supporting this conclusion in the rolling
coefficients estimates from our elastic net model, discussed in Section 4.4.
The models that take account of monetary policy stance (in Columns (4)-(5)) improve the
fit of the model in the second subperiod. For DMs, the R-squared for the second subperiod is
0.54 in Column (5) of Table 5, compared to 0.49 in Column (3). For EMs, in Table 6, the
comparable change in R-squared is from 0.41 to 0.44. For both DMs and EMs, the coefficients
on Fed and CBexFed are both negative and statistically significant in the later subperiod. In the

26

early subperiod, coefficients on those two variables are smaller and insignificant for DMs, and
only CBexFed (not Fed) is significant (and negative) for EMs. We discuss the economic
magnitude of these coefficients below.
4.1 Lagged Reaction to News or Risk Premium?
As we discussed in Section 2, we interpret the coefficients in the forecasting model as
risk indicators. An alternative view is that the exchange rate market is inefficient and these
forecasting variables reflect lagging responses of exchange rates to news. We performed an
informal investigation of this alternative, inefficient-markets interpretation by using the same
regressors to predict contemporaneous returns, and also one month-ahead returns, rather than
twelve month-ahead returns. If our model captured news with a lag, we would expect the
coefficients for the twelve month horizon to reflect effects that were visible early on, either in
contemporaneous covariation28 or one month-ahead covariation. We find that is not the case.
For the four full regression specifications for DMs and EMs for early and late periods,
which are reported in columns 4 and 5 of Tables 5 and 6, there are a total of 43 coefficients that
are statistically significant. Of those 43 coefficients, in the contemporaneous exchange rate
return regressions (reported in Online Appendix Tables A5 and A6), 27 are statistically zero,
eight of them are statistically significant but opposite in sign, and 8 of them are statistically
significant and of the same sign but typically much smaller than the coefficient estimates in
Tables 5 and 6. In the one-month ahead regressions (reported in Online Appendix Tables A7 and
A8), we find similar results. Of the 43 coefficients that are significant in Columns (4) and (5) of
Tables 5 and 6, 24 are statistically zero, two are significant but opposite in sign, and 17 are

Obviously, we do not interpret the contemporaneous regression as providing causal evidence, but rather as
indicative of correlations.
28

27

significant, of similar sign, but smaller. We conclude that it would be implausible to interpret our
model as reflecting inefficient, lagging responses to news.
4.2 Variation in the Signs of Coefficients
The R-squared of the Column (1) regression in Table 5, which spans the entire period,
1996-2016, is 0.29, in contrast the much higher R-squareds if the two periods are treated
separately (0.66 for the 1996-2006 subperiod and 0.49 for the 2006-2016 subperiod). In Table 6,
the R-squareds for the two subperiods are similarly much higher than for the whole period,
though lower than the DM ones in Table 5. This is a clear indicator that forcing the model to
maintain stable parameter estimates across subperiods produces inferior overall fit.
Although some coefficient values are consistent across time (e.g., the three risk measures
– vol1m, vol2m and VIX – consistently have a positive sign when they are significant), the
instability of some of the model parameters across the two subperiods is striking in both Tables 5
and 6. Consistent with the findings reported in Hodrick and Tomunen (2018), for DMs, the
coefficient on carry switches from positive significant to negative insignificant (in our out-ofsample results, we will show that it is negative and significant for the early part of the second
subperiod). We return to focus on understanding this reversal in Section 5. In EMs, carry is
positive but statistically insignificant in both subperiods in Table 6.
How should one interpret the fact that the coefficient on carry for EMs is insignificant
despite the fact that trading EM currencies using the carry factor is so profitable, as we will
discuss below, and as is shown in Figure 4?29 Note that the regression coefficient on carry
indicates the returns forecast of carry after controlling for other country fixed and varying

Compare the cumulative return of the HMLFX factor using the full set of countries in our paper (from Table 11) in
the upper right-hand portion of Figure 4 to the cumulative return of the HMLFX factor constructed using only the
DM country sample in the upper right-hand portion of Figure A4 in the Online Appendix. The factor construction
methodology is discussed in Section 6.

28

characteristics (i.e., the other regressors in the model), while the carry factor is a trading strategy
that identifies countries’ currencies to buy or sell on the basis of their interest rate differentials
alone, and does not control for other country fixed and varying characteristics. In other words, it
appears that the profitability of the carry factor reflects the correlation between interest rate
differentials and country characteristics, not the differential per se. The fact that the carry
coefficient is significant for DMs, but the carry factor is less important as a DM trading strategy
illustrates the opposite interpretation: in DMs, carry is not a very useful proxy for a country risk
characteristic, but rather an important forecasting variable after controlling for fixed and varying
country characteristics. In other words, the profitability of the carry trade in EMs reflects other
factors (e.g., persistent country risk, captured by vol1m or vol12m or VIX) rather than the interest
rate difference, per se.
4.3 Global Monetary Policy Influences
Despite differences in the EM and DM models, the patterns that relate to the influence of
monetary policy changes of the major central banks on exchange rates remain present and similar
in EMs and DMs. As already noted, the coefficient on T-bill flips from insignificant to positive
significant across the two subperiods for both EMs and DMs, and this occurs in all versions of
the model when treas_basis is included in the model (T-bill is negative significant in the early
period without the inclusion of treas_basis). The coefficient on exFedRate goes from close-tozero in the early subperiod to negative, significant for both DMs and EMs in the later subperiod.
The coefficients on Fed and CBexFed in Columns (4) and (5) of Tables 5 and 6 are large,
negative and statistically significant in both EMs and DMs for the later subperiod. The same
variables have smaller and less significant effects in the earlier subperiod (as Table 7 shows, the

29

CBexFed early subperiod DM coefficient of -2.097 is significant at the 27 percent level), though
CBexFed is still highly significant and negative for EMs in the early subperiod.
What do these results say about global monetary policy influences on 12-month returns?
As we have already noted, the sign flipping of T-bill may indicate that in much of the later period
(when rates were near the zero-lower bound in the U.S.), variation in the three-month Treasury
bill rate is no longer driven mainly by monetary policy. Its small upticks (downticks) likely
reflect real influences that happen to be associated with dollar depreciation (appreciation).
Monetary policy stance, as captured by the two Prattle measures (Fed and CBexFed), is a
much more important predictor in the second subperiod, during which both measures become
strong negative predictors of currency returns against the dollar. Low Prattle scores forecast the
appreciation of currencies against the dollar. Interestingly, CBexFed has a similar effect to Fed,
and its magnitude is much larger (more than twice the size of the coefficient on Fed). That
suggests that each of the three non-Fed major central banks had almost as much importance for
predicting, say, the appreciation of the dollar value of the Brazilian real, as the Fed did. To get a
sense of the economic magnitude of this effect, consider that the standard deviations of our
monthly Fed and CBexFed measures are 0.38 and 0.30 respectively. For DMs, the second
subperiod Fed and CBexFed coefficients in Table 5 are -5.131 and -12.910 respectively.
Therefore a unit standard deviation increase in the dovishness of the big four central banks
forecasts a positive return on DM currencies against the dollar of 5.8% in the subsequent year.
For EMs, from Table 6, the relevant coefficient estimates are -3.065 and -9.292, implying a
positive return on EM currencies against the dollar of 4.0% over the subsequent year. Clearly,
these are very large economic effects.

It is important to note that the negative coefficients on CBexFed and exFedRate in Table
5 do not imply that tightening by a country’s own central bank would predict that its own
currency would depreciate relative to the dollar (e.g., we are not saying tightening by the Bank of
Japan would cause a yen depreciation). CBexFed and exFedRate are averaged for the major nonUS countries, and the dominant influence in the average will generally be countries other than
the subject DM country in the panel regression (furthermore the majority of countries in the DM
panel, and all countries in the EM panel, do not have their central banks in CBexFed or
exFedRate). In results not reported here (due to the limited country coverage by Prattle), we
separate own-country Prattle effects from the responses to CBexFed and exFedRate for DMs.
The coefficient on the own-country Prattle score is generally positive, although it is only
statistically significant in the early period for DMs. Thus, when a DM country’s central bank
tightens, that predicts that its own currency will appreciate against the dollar, but tightening by
any of the big four central banks predicts that EM currencies and other DM currencies will
depreciate against the dollar.
In Table 7, we decompose CBexFed into its three constituents to explore differences in
the contributions of the ECB, the BOE and the BOJ to the predictive power of CBexFed. We
report results for DMs (Panel A) separately from EMs (Panel B) and we divide the data into the
same two subperiods, as before. For DMs, the ECB drives CBexFed in the early subperiod.
Including it alone in the place of CBexFed increases the magnitude and significance of the
coefficient. In the later subperiod for DMs, both the ECB and the BOE are important and
coefficients are much larger than before. For EMs, the ECB’s coefficient is large in both periods
but only significant in the early period (though the p-value in the later subperiod is 0.13). The
BOE displays a comparable effect on EM exchange rate returns in the early subperiod and a

31

much larger one in the later subperiod. The BOJ has a relatively small and insignificant influence
on EMs in the early period, but a larger and statistically significant influence on EMs in the later
period. The fact that the BOJ and BOE exert relatively greater roles than the ECB on EMs is
interesting and suggests the potential regional importance of Japan for Asian EMs and perhaps
the role of London as the most important of the three global financial centers for EMs.
In summary, there are several important facts that the analysis of Tables 5-7 brings to
light about monetary policy and exchange rate returns. First, a monetary tightening posture by
the major non-Fed central banks in the later subperiod, whether captured by non-Fed interest rate
increases or by higher Prattle scores, tends to be associated with the future appreciation of the
dollar relative to other currencies. This pattern is visible for both DMs and EMs. The magnitude
of the effect is more than twice the size of the dollar appreciation that results from Fed
tightening. Second, any forecasting model of exchange rate returns must take account of
structural instability that produces changes in coefficient values over time (as we do more
systematically in the rolling coefficient estimate results reported below). Out-of-sample
modeling and structural instability turn out to be particularly important for interpreting the cause,
timing, and duration of the carry reversal for DMs. Third, the reversal of the predictive role of
carry, from a positive to a negative (or zero) predictor of exchange rate returns, is limited to DM
countries. In EMs, carry is not a significant predictor of exchange rate returns in either
subperiod. We address these findings and interpret them from the perspective of the asset pricing
literature in Section 7.
4.4 Model Selection: Elastic Net Estimates
We now discuss the statistical evidence supporting inclusion of all our explanatory
variables in our panel regressions. Figure 5 shows significant changes over time in the elastic

32

net coefficient estimates for all variables in our model, including the text measures describing
central bank policy, labeled Fed and CBexFed. Coefficient magnitudes, when non-zero, are
large and similar to the statistically significant coefficients identified in our panel regression
results (reported in Tables 5 and 6), and have similar temporal patterns. It is interesting to note
the variation in EM and DM coefficients is often similar, although the two models are estimated
independently. For example, the DM and EM coefficients for both logRSpotNeg and
logRSpotPos (which proxy for long-term deviations away from a fixed real exchange rate) move
substantially and together over time. Even more striking is the similarity between EM and DM
loadings on Fed and CBexFed for the 12-month return rolling elastic net estimates, suggesting
that global central bank policy news plays a similar role in exchange rate determination across
DM and EM contexts, a result we return to in analyzing the effects of different base currencies.
The elastic net regressions address concerns about multicollinearity of our regressors. If
one forecasting variable dominated another one in every rolling five-year window over the data,
then the latter forecasting variable would always show up as zero in our elastic nets. However,
for our DM regressions this never happens. Every one of our 21 forecasting variables enters
positively in multiple windows suggesting that all these variables capture some aspect of
currency expected returns. We therefore conclude that each of our forecasting variables is
justified on statistical grounds, and including them in our regressions provides a good baseline
model against which to assess the usefulness of our central bank variables, Fed and CBexFed.
Finally, while there is some evidence that several of our forecasting variables are not
useful for forecasting EM currency returns against the dollar (for example, the reserves to GDP
ratio, res_GDP, and net foreign assets, nfa, don’t seem to enter the EM forecasting elastic nets),
we include them in our EM panels to maintain model consistency with the DM specification.

33

4.5 Monetary Policy Spillovers
How do we think about the finding that CBexFed forecasts currency returns against the
US dollar? Under the inefficient-markets (lagging reaction to news) interpretation of the
negative coefficient of CBexFed, one possible aspect of the news to which exchange rates might
be presumed to react slowly is news that CBexFed might contain about future Fed policy. As
Taylor (2018) shows, measuring policy using interest rates or central bank balance sheet size, the
major central banks respond to each other’s policies. It is possible that hawkish non-U.S. big
three central bank Prattle scores predict dollar appreciation because they predict future actions by
the Fed, which controls the supply of dollars.
One piece of evidence against this view is the finding by Gerko and Rey (2017) that Bank
of England policy, as measured by changes in a short sterling futures contract, has no effect on
U.S. interest rates or other economic variables. If the Fed’s policy predictably responded to Bank
of England actions, then that response should be reflected in U.S. interest rates changes, but it is
not. We investigate the question of dynamic interactions among central banks more directly with
a VAR analysis where we ask whether the predictive power of CBexFed and exFedRate are
reflecting the roles of those variables as news about future Fed tightening.
We analyze the dynamic predictability of each other’s Prattle scores and each other’s
interest rates across central banks, and the relationship between Prattle scores, on the one hand,
and own-country or other-countries’ interest rates. In Figure 6, Panel A, we report Granger
causality tests for Prattle scores among the major central banks, which are reported separately for
the two subperiods. In neither of the two subperiods do we find that the Fed’s Prattle score is
predicted by the Prattle scores of other central banks.

34

It is possible, however, that Fed monetary policy changes reflected in the short-term
interest rate react to other central bank actions, even if the Fed’s Prattle score does not. This view
finds some support in In Panel B of Figure 6. There we report Granger causality results for onemonth changes in short-term interest rates across countries. We find that the Fed’s actions
(measured through interest rate changes) are indeed predicted by interest rate changes of other
central banks in the second half of the sample, even though Fed Prattle scores are not predicted
by the Prattle scores of other central banks. This indicates that, in the second subperiod,
exFedRate may be predicting dollar appreciation in part through its role as a forecaster of T-bill.
The causality tests in Panels A and B of Figure 6 suggest that central bank policies, either
as measured through Prattle or their domestic short-rates, became more interrelated following the
financial crisis. This is supportive of Taylor’s (2018) argument that in the quantitative easing era
– without the constraints of traditional monetary policy – central banks engaged in de-facto
currency devaluations by more actively responding to one another’s policies.
However, these observed connections among interest rate changes do not explain the
power of CBexFed in our model. If CBexFed matters in our model mainly because it is
forecasting Fed or Fed interest rate changes, then we would expect it to forecast the T-bill
(because as shown in Panel A of Figure 6, CBexFed does not predict Fed). In Online Appendix
Figure A19 we construct a bivariate VAR of CBexFed and T-bill and we find that CBexFed does
not significantly predict T-bill changes in either subperiod.30 We conclude that CBexFed does not
matter for dollar exchange rate returns because of inefficiently lagging responses to the news
contained in CBexFed about future Fed policy reactions.

Similarly, Figure A20 shows that changes in exFedRate do not forecast changes in Fed Prattle in either subperiod,
despite the role of exFedRate in forecasting T-bill.

30

35

A different, inefficient-markets interpretation of the impact of CBexFed is also
conceivable. It may be that the underlying mechanism for why CBexFed is able to forecast
exchange rates against the dollar is a substitutability among the major developed market
currencies, as posited by McKinnon (1982), McKinnon and Tan (1983), and McKinnon et al.
(1984). For example, if tighter Bank of Japan policy makes the yen less readily available, then
global investors may switch to holding dollars, thus causing a dollar appreciation in response to
tightening by the Bank of Japan. As we show in Section 4.6, however, this currency
substitutability effect does not appear to be present. If currency substitutability were driving the
forecasting power of CBexFed, then we would expect to find symmetric results when we alter
the base currency for our regressions. But we find no such symmetry.
We therefore interpret the forecasting importance of Fed and CBexFed as reflecting
global risk factors that influence monetary policy. This interpretation follows from the
perspective of the risk-pricing model we develop in Section 7. Monetary policy in the second
period is a more powerful indicator of global risk than it had been in the early period because
monetary policy reacts more to risk than it had done previously. As we showed in Section 3, risk
became more important for influencing non-U.S. central banks’ monetary policy stances in the
second period. For example, the result in the VAR analysis of Figures 2, 3, A17, and A18, that
hawkish policy shocks forecast lower levels of the VIX in the later subperiod, indicate that
monetary policy makers were keenly aware of their potential market impact.
4.6 Results with Non-Dollar Base Currencies
Thus far our analysis has modeled exchange rate returns against the US dollar. In Tables
8, 9 and 10 we explore how our Fed, CBexFed, and carry results change when the base currency
used is the euro, the British pound or the yen, respectively.

36

We find that the estimation results for the carry coefficient are highly consistent
regardless of the base currency chosen. For DMs, the carry coefficient goes from positive in the
early subperiod to negative in the later subperiod. And for EMs, the carry coefficient is always
positive, although of a smaller magnitude that the DM carry coefficient. From this we conclude
that the carry results we obtain are invariant to the base currency.
However, we see that the Fed and CBexFed coefficients have much lower magnitudes in
the regressions in Tables 8, 9, and 10, where the dollar is not the base currency, compared to the
ones with the dollar as the base currency in Table 7. In fact, neither central bank variable has a
significant negative coefficient in either the DM or the EM regressions in either subperiod
(except with the pound for DMs in the late subperiod). In fact, the CBexFed coefficient for the
euro as the base currency (Table 8) is positive in the second subperiod for both DMs and EMs.
This suggests that tighter monetary policy by the central banks other than the Fed causes a euro
depreciation relative to other currencies (since the other currencies tend to appreciate relative to
the euro), exactly the opposite effect that we saw for the dollar.
These results show that monetary policy influences among the major central banks are
not symmetric, which is inconsistent with the currency substitution interpretation of the
importance of CBexFed as a dollar exchange rate forecaster. The influences of the monetary
policy postures of the major central banks for forecasting exchange rate returns operate through
the dollar, and not through the other major global currencies.31 We explore this result further in

These results also provide further reassurance regarding potential in-sample bias with respect to the construction
of the Prattle measures. In Prattle’s training window, the security set included the central bank’s own (e.g. euro for
the ECB) currency against a trade-weighted basket. If in-sample bias were a problem, one would expect the results
of Tables 8, 9 and 10 to be stronger, not weaker, than those in Table 7 (which is out-of-sample for the Fed in the
second subperiod and uses a different base currency than the training security set for the non-Fed central banks).

channels.
4.7 Increasing Uncertainty about Central Bank Policy
Finally, we explore how changes in monetary policy regimes (pre- and post-global crisis)
have affected market uncertainty about exchange rate modeling. Obstfeld and Rogoff (2002)
provide a model of exchange rates in which the adoption of flexible inflation rate targeting rules
by central banks limits the exchange rate uncertainty that can arise from ad hoc interventions in
the exchange market, which can also give rise to competitive devaluations. Taylor (2018) shows
that a commitment to flexible inflation targeting has been particularly absent in recent years. He
and the literature he surveys find that, especially after the global financial crisis, central banks
frequently departed from rule-based behavior, and often varied monetary policy in an effort to
influence the exchange rate, and this became a major source of competitive devaluation during
the post-crisis era.
In our analysis, we consider whether the activist and novel policy regime of recent years
produced greater uncertainty about exchange rates, as implied by Obstfeld and Rogoff (2002)
and Taylor (2018). Using out elastic net model described in Section 2, we find no evidence of a
significant persistent increase in the root mean-squared error for exchange rate return forecasts
after the crisis. This result suggests that, although central bank policy became more novel in its
approach and became a more important source of news, central banks were able to convey their
thinking to the market sufficiently well (as our Prattle measure captures) to mitigate any resulting
increase in forecasting uncertainty related to reduced reliance on prior implicit or explicit
monetary rules. Further details about this analysis are in the Online Appendix.

38

5. Further Evidence Related to the Selective Carry Variable Reversal
Here we consider the reversal in the second subperiod of the first subperiod’s positive
predictive role of carry for exchange rate returns in DMs. Why should this effect be selective
(i.e., confined to DMs), and why does the late subperiod reverse the pattern from the early
subperiod?
The selective reversal, which was apparent in our panel regression analysis in Tables 5
and 6, is also visible in simple country-level association between twelve-month exchange rate
returns and the country’s interest differential against the dollar (carry). In Table 11, we report the
slope coefficients from regressing twelve-month ahead currency returns against the subject
country’s interest rate differential to the US for each of the ten DM countries.32 In all ten cases,
the positive association, which we refer to as the return-carry beta, is visible for the early
subperiod, and changes to a negative slope in the late subperiod (scatter plots for each country
are presented in Online Appendix Figures A9-A11). For EMs, no such pattern is visible, with the
exception of a few cases, such as Israel and Chile (see the scatter plots in Online Appendix
Figures A9-A11).
The pre-crisis global economy was characterized by less synchronous economic cycles
across countries than in the post-crisis era. In Sections 7.2 and 7.3 below, we explain how this
difference between the two subperiods can result in different patterns of association between
interest differentials and exchange rate returns. The intuition is as follows. In the early
(relatively asynchronous) period, cyclical changes produce episodes where a country’s marginal
utility of consumption and precautionary savings rise or fall together relative to those of other

This is a 12-month version of the classic return versus carry-differential test of uncovered interest rate parity from
Fama (1984).
32

39

countries. That positive comovement results in interest rate differentials and expected returns on
currencies that change in the same direction. However, during the post-crisis (relatively
synchronous global economic cycle) period, countries that differ with respect to the cyclical
sensitivities of their marginal utilities of consumption and their precautionary savings demands
can see their marginal utilities of consumption and their precautionary savings moving in
opposite directions relative to one another. Those differences can cause interest rate differentials
and expected currency returns to move in opposite directions.
In Section 7.3, we show that this model implies that in the pre-crisis period, the variance
of a country’s carry (rate differential against the dollar) generally should be weakly negatively
correlated with its return-carry beta. But in the post-crisis period our model implies that the
variance of carry and return-carry betas should be positively correlated for DMs.
We provide evidence consistent with this implication in Figure 7. First, in the left-hand
side of Panel A of Figure 7, for each of the two subperiods, we estimate each currency’s returncarry beta by running a time series regression for each of the DM countries of its twelve-month
currency excess returns vs the dollar against lagged carry. The return-carry betas for those
twenty regressions (for the ten DM countries and two subperiods) are then plotted against the
variance of carry in each of the country-subperiods. The early subperiod points and regression
line through them are shown in blue, and the post-crisis ones in red. First we note that high
variances tend to occur in the early subperiod, and low variances tend to occur in the late
subperiod. Second, in the pre-crisis period carry variance and return-carry betas are weakly
negatively correlated, whereas in the post-crisis period they are strongly positively correlated.
A similar analysis of EM country-subperiods, provided in the left-hand side of Panel B of
Figure 7, shows a different pattern. In EMs, there is no association between the carry coefficient

40

and the variance of carry. Furthermore, the carry variance is much higher in EM countries:
almost all of the DM country-subperiod observations for the standard deviation of carry are less
than 0.04, while in EMs, the vast majority are greater than 0.04.
We also considered how changes in the carry effect in DMs may have coincided with
changes in the patterns of capital inflows. The predictions of the risk-pricing model we discuss in
Section 7 are not clear cut for capital flows, but it is possible that relative decreases in savings
among countries could be a source of capital inflows, and therefore, DMs with the strongest
carry reversal should also experience greater capital inflows. An association between capital
inflows and exchange rate returns may also reflect slow adjustment under inefficient markets. If
slow adjustment of exchange rates to capital inflows exerted upward pressure on expected
exchange rate returns as well as downward pressure on domestic interest rates in the second
period, then countries that experienced heavy capital inflows in the later subperiod should have
exhibited lower carry betas in the later period relative to the earlier period. It is also conceivable
that capital inflow differences across countries reflected influences not captured in Section 7,
such as differences in the riskiness of financial systems that gave rise to flight-to-quality to lowrisk destinations. However, models of flight-to-quality to low-risk destinations in anticipation of
a severe global financial shock have opposite implications for capital inflow changes than those
reported in Figure 7. Specifically, safe havens should experience increased capital outflows
during such episodes.33
We examine the relation between carry beta changes and capital inflows, separately for
DMs and EMs, on the right-hand side of Panels A and B of Figure 7, respectively. We find that

Low-risk countries provide a safe store of value, which can be used in crisis times. Hence, during crises, we
would expect to see capital outflows from safe countries. See Gourinchas, Rey and Govillot (2018) and Maggiori
(2017), which build on the thinking of Gourinchas and Rey (2007) and Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas (2008).
33

41

carry beta change is negatively related to the change in capital inflows34 for DMs (with a tstatistic of 1.87), but they are not significantly negatively related in EMs. For DMs, higher postcrisis capital inflows are associated with more negative carry betas.35

6. Decomposing Regression Results into Idiosyncratic vs. Factor Channels
As noted in the introduction, the literature has identified a few factors that capture
substantial exchange rate return variation. The two most important factors are the dollar factor
RX and the carry factor HMLFX (not to be confused with the carry regressor used above). The
dollar factor is an equal weighted index of a select set of currencies, and captures the common
variation of all other currencies against the dollar. The carry factor captures the exchange rate
returns differences between high-interest rate and low-interest rate countries. Investing in the
dollar factor implies going long all other currencies against the dollar. Investing in the carry
factor implies going long the currencies of the countries with the highest interest rates and going
short the currencies with the lowest interest rates. We also considered a third factor, known as
the dollar carry (DC) factor, which selectively takes a long (short) dollar position when the
average of all other countries’ short-term rates is lower (higher) than the dollar rate.

Our capital flows measure is the net inflows to the private sector coming from the three portfolio investment series
(debt to banks, debt to other sectors, and equity), as reported in Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2017).
35
We also considered additional regression specifications in which we interacted Fed and CBexFed with carry, to
see whether the role of carry varied with the directional stance of monetary policy. In the Online Appendix, in
Tables A9 and A10, we report those results. We find that, in both DMs and EMs, there is some evidence that carry’s
ability to forecast returns depends on the state of monetary policy, though these results are not always statistically
significant. The negative coefficient on the carry*CBexFed variable in Tables A9 and A10 implies that carry
reversal occurs in the second subperiod for EMs only when CBexFed is sufficiently positive (making the interacted
term sufficiently negative to offset the positive insignificant coefficient on carry). Note also that the negative DM
carry coefficient is made even more negative when CBexFed is positive.
34

42

6.1 Factor Construction
Our factor analysis follows Lustig, Roussanov and Verdelhan (LRV, 2011, 2014),
Verdelhan (2018), and Aloosh and Bekaert (2019). These studies identify factors that represent
common components of currency returns against the dollar across different countries. The dollar
factor, RX, found by Verdelhan (2018) to explain the majority of time-series variation in
currency returns, is simply an equal weighted average of currency returns against the dollar for a
given basket of countries. For the carry factor, HMLFX, we use the LRV methodology to define
the factor: in a given month t this factor is the return from going long 1/6 of the highest yielding
∗
countries relative to the dollar in month t-1 (those with the lowest 𝑓𝑡−1 − 𝑠𝑡−1 = 𝑦𝑡−1 − 𝑦𝑡−1
)

and going short the 1/6 of countries with the lowest interest rate differential to the dollar. Again,
this factor is calculated using a given basket of currencies. Finally, we look at the dollar carry
factor, DC, from LRV (2014) which goes long a basket of currencies against the dollar when
their average interest rate differential to the dollar from the prior month is positive, and goes
short this basket of currencies, i.e. goes long the dollar, when their average interest rate
differential in the prior month is negative. This factor’s returns in a given month is equal to
±𝑅𝑋𝑡 depending on whether DC is long or short the dollar.
Figure A4 shows the cumulative returns of RX, HMLFX, and DC for the DM currencies
(which are the same in our paper as in LRV). All cumulative return series in Figure A4 (as well
as Figures 4 and A5 which we discuss below) have been normalized to equal one in January of
1999. Superimposed on the charts are the cumulative returns of RX and HMLFX obtained from
Lustig and Verdelhan’s websites (their factor time-series ends earlier than ours). As can be seen
from Figure A4, our RX and HMLFX and those of LRV are virtually identical. The lower lefthand figure shows the dollar factor, with our RX and HMLFX, superimposed for comparison.
43

The lower right-hand figure shows the average interest rate differential of the currency basket
(𝑖)

against the dollar, i.e. 1/𝑁 ∑𝑖(𝑦𝑡 − 𝑦𝑡 ), which tends to fluctuate over time. Also shown are the
annualized factor returns, volatilities and Sharpe ratios.
Figure A5 shows the same factors as Figure A4, but using the basket of currencies
corresponding to the full currency set of LRV (not restricted to DM countries). Here our dollar
factor is almost identical to theirs, though there is a slight difference in HMLFX though our two
series still track each other very closely.36 The DC factor is almost identical to RX for this
currency basket because the average interest rate differential to the dollar is almost always
positive (lower right-hand chart). Notably, the Sharpe ratio of the carry factor is close to one,
and is twice as high at the Sharpe ratio of the DM carry factor. Furthermore, while the DM carry
factor in Figure A4 has had a poor post-crisis performance, no such performance degradation is
visible in the carry factor for the larger currency set.
Finally, in Figure 4 we plot the same factors but for the set of countries used in the
current paper (making it not directly comparable to the LRV factors). Notably the Sharpe ratio
of the carry trade now jumps to almost 1.5 – though it is likely that several of the currencies in
our data set are very illiquid, something we do not control for in our analysis. Otherwise the
factors from this larger set are qualitatively similar to the ones in Figure A5.
In our factor decompositions in Section 6.2, we use the LRV-set of countries (the factors
from Figure A5) for RX and HMLFX, and we use the DC factor from the DM countries (Figure
A4) because the other DC factors are almost identical to their respective RX factors.
6.2 Analysis of Factors

The calculation of the RX factor only relies on currency returns. The calculation of HMLFX also relies on forward
differentials to the dollar, which are much noisier. The discrepancy is attributable to our having slightly different
currency forwards data.

36

44

According to Figure A4, a trading strategy for DM countries based on the dollar factor
produces a portfolio value that rises by only about ten percent cumulatively from 1999 to 2016
(all cumulative return series are normalized to one in January 1999). The carry factor trading
strategy for DMs over the same period produces roughly a doubling of value, although there is a
steep drop in 2008-2009, and flat returns thereafter. This parallels our prior discussion of the
reversal of the role of the carry variable for DMs in the later subperiod.
When we include EMs in the trading strategy to construct global versions of the factor
trading strategies, as shown in Figures 4 (our full sample) and A5 (the LRV sample), the pattern
for the dollar factor trading strategy is similar to that seen for only DMs, but the carry factor
trading strategy results in much higher cumulative returns (a 2016 portfolio value 3.5 times its
1999 value for the LRV sample and of 6 times the 1999 value for our full sample of countries),
although there is also a severe dip in 2008-2009.
The dollar carry factor trading strategy DC in DMs substantially outperforms the dollar
factor trading strategy, as indicated by the lower left panel in Figure A4. But when the dollar
carry factor strategy is applied to all countries, whether using the LRV sample or our sample, it
does not improve upon the simple dollar factor because the interest rate differential relative to
the dollar is almost always positive, as can be seen in the lower right-hand chart in Figures 4 and
A5.
Table A3 computes country betas for the 1996-2016 period for the ten DM countries for
the RX and HMLFX factors obtained from the LRV set of countries. For DMs, coefficients for
the dollar factor are large and positive (averaging 1.27), while they are negative or small positive
for the carry factor (averaging -0.22). For EMs, reported in Table A4, the patterns are different.

45

The average coefficient on the dollar factor is smaller (0.86), and for the carry factor the average
coefficient is positive (0.14).
How do our panel regression results relate to the dollar and carry factors? 37 To what
extent is the forecasting power of the variables in Tables 5 and 6 explicable in terms of factor
loadings on the dollar and carry factors? In particular, through which factors do monetary policy
influences matter most? In Tables 12 and 13 we decompose the coefficient loadings from
Columns (4) and (5) of Tables 5 and 6 into their factor exposures. For each country i, we
decompose its excess returns against the dollar by running the following regression38
(𝑖)

We then run the panel regression in (2) separately for each of the three components in the above
decomposition (where the expressions referred to here as Dollar, Carry, and Residual are the
dependent variables in the three regressions). For any explanatory variable from Tables 5 and 6,
these three panel regressions produce a decomposition of the forecasting power of that variable
into the portion due to its ability to forecast through currencies’ dollar factor, carry factor and
residual exposures.
For example, for the late-subperiod DM regression in Column (5) of Table 5, we see that
the Fed coefficient is -5.131. The “Late period” panel of Table 12 reproduces this coefficient in
the “Full” column, and then shows that -4.083 of this loading is attributable to Fed variable’s
ability to forecast the dollar component of returns (“Dollar” column), 0.152 is due to the Fed’s

We also considered adding the dollar carry factor to this analysis, but we found that this factor was not an
important channel for any of the variation explained by our regression model, so we did not include it in the results
discussed here. Tables A3 and A4 show the DC contributed a negligible amount of explanatory power in most
cases.
38
We experimented with the MSCI All Country Index of stock returns as an additional factor, but it explains a very
small proportion of residual variation for both DMs and EMs, after including RX and HMLFX, and so we omit it
from this analysis.

ability to forecast the carry component of returns (“HMLFX” column), and -1.2 is due to Fed’s
ability to forecast the residual currency return (“Resid” column). By linearity of the regression,
the three coefficients sum to -5.131. The “Early period” panel shows this decomposition for the
early subperiod.
Several interesting patterns emerge in Table 12 (DM) and Table 13 (EM) with regard to
non-monetary-policy variables. For DMs, several macro variables, cpiYOYUS, exFedGdprYOY
and gdprYOYUS, forecast returns largely through currencies’ dollar exposures in the early
subperiod. In the late subperiod for DMs, most of the macro variables, cpiYOY, gdprYOY,
exFedCpiYOY, in addition to the three already mentioned, now operate through the HMLFX
factor. No such pattern with regard to the macro variables is apparent for EMs. Of our market
variables for DMs, vol12m and VIX positively forecast returns in the later subperiod, and operate
through the dollar factor channel. For EMs, in the early subperiod, vol1m and vol12m positively
forecast the residual component of returns; and in the later subperiod for EMs vol12m and VIX
positively forecast returns through the dollar channel. For both DMs (both subperiods) and EMs
(late subperiod), logRSpotNeg is a negative forecaster of returns, and operates through the
residual channel.
With regard to our monetary policy predictors, most are better, or at least equally strong,
forecasters of the dollar component of returns than of the HMLFX component or of the residual.
For DMs, that is true for carry in the early subperiod, and for T-bill, exFedRate, CBexFed, and
for Fed in the late subperiod. In EMs, T-bill, exFedRate, Fed, and CBexFed are better forecasters
of the dollar component of returns in the later subperiod.
One general finding is that for DMs, in the early subperiod, many of the forecasting
variables operated through the dollar channel, whereas in the later subperiod many more

47

forecasting variables operate through either the HMLFX or the residual channel. For EMs, there
is generally predictability through the dollar channel in both subperiods. We investigate these
finding in the context of a no-arbitrage pricing model in Section 7.
Another finding across DMs and EMs noted above is that in the later subperiod when
non-U.S. DM central banks, on average, adopt a tightening posture of monetary policy, as
evidenced either through their interest rate or their Prattle score, or when the Fed Prattle score
indicates tightening, this causes DM and EM currencies to depreciate against the dollar through a
common dollar factor channel. The importance of the dollar factor for exFedRate and CBexFed
may be capturing changes in the global economy that drive changes in the demand for money
(which is related to the dollar, given the special role of the dollar as a reserve currency), and this
may partially explain our result that changes in non-US monetary policy affect exchange rates
only when the US dollar is the base currency.

7. Conceptual Framework
Our general perspective follows the finance literature’s view that predictable variation in
expected returns reflects time-varying risk (Cochrane 2011).39 We start with a nominal version of
a currency model in the spirit of Bekaert (1996), Bansal (1997) and Backus et al. (2001). As
(𝑖)

before, we let 𝑆𝑡 be the dollar price of a unit of foreign currency, and let 𝑀𝑡 and 𝑀𝑡 be the US
and the country i stochastic discount factor (SDF) respectively. We think of this model as
applying to all bilateral exchange rates against the dollar, though for notational simplicity we

Several papers have found evidence linking risk and exchange rate returns, including Colacito et al. (2018) and
Kremens and Martin (2018).

No-arbitrage, and complete markets, imply that40
(𝑖)

𝑠𝑡+1 − 𝑠𝑡 = 𝑚𝑡+1 − 𝑚𝑡+1 ,

(5)

where lowercase letters indicate logs. Using this and assuming lognormality of the SDFs, the
expected excess return from owning the foreign currency is41

𝐸𝑡 [𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 ] = 𝐸𝑡 𝑠𝑡+1 − 𝑓𝑡 =

1
(𝑖)
[𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑡 (𝑚𝑡+1 ) − 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑡 (𝑚𝑡+1 )].
2

(6)

(𝑖)

The 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑡 (𝑚𝑡+1 ) and 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑡 (𝑚𝑡+1 ) terms measure the uncertainty of next period’s log SDF. The
country with the higher uncertainty expects risk compensation for owning the other country’s
currency. If the variances in (6) are equal, then the forward rate is the time t expectation of the
t+1 exchange rate and uncovered interest rate parity holds. Using (6), we can write the excess
return 𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 , defined in equation (1) in Section 2, of a currency against the dollar as
𝑠𝑡+1 − 𝑓𝑡 = 𝐸𝑡 [𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 ] + 𝜖𝑡+1 ,

(7)

where 𝜖𝑡+1 is orthogonal to 𝐸𝑡 [𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 ], the time-t forecast of the excess return.
The recent literature on exchange rates models the reduced form log SDF’s as having
time-varying loadings on identically and independently distributed innovations (for example,
Lustig et al. 2014 equation 9, or Verdelhan 2018 equation 1). Such specifications result in
(𝑖)

(𝑖)

The two Euler equations are 1 = 𝐸𝑡 [𝑀𝑡+1 𝑅𝑡+1 ] and 1 = 𝐸𝑡 [𝑀𝑡+1 𝑅𝑡+1 ] where the (i)’s indicate foreign quantities.
The Euler equation for a US dollar investor who converts dollars into foreign currency, invests in a foreign asset for
(𝑖)
one period, and then converts the resulting positive back into dollars is 1 = 𝐸𝑡 [𝑀𝑡+1 𝑅𝑡+1 /𝑆𝑡 × 𝑆𝑡+1 ]. Assuming

40

(𝑖)

complete markets implies 𝑀𝑡+1 = 𝑀𝑡+1 𝑆𝑡+1 /𝑆𝑡 . Lustig and Verdelhan (2019) study the effect of incompleteness in
this framework.
41
Noting that entering at time t into a one-period forward contract costs nothing, we have that 𝐸𝑡 [𝑀𝑡+1 (𝑆𝑡+1 −
(𝑖)
(𝑖)
𝐹𝑡 )] = 0, which implies that 𝐹𝑡 ⁄𝑆𝑡 𝐸𝑡 [𝑀𝑡+1 ] = 𝐸𝑡 [𝑀𝑡+1 𝑆𝑡+1 ⁄𝑆𝑡 ] = 𝐸𝑡 [𝑀𝑡+1 ]. Therefore 𝑓𝑡 − 𝑠𝑡 = log 𝐸𝑡 [𝑀𝑡+1 ] −
(𝑖)
(𝑖)
log 𝐸𝑡 [𝑀𝑡+1 ]. Assuming lognormality of the SDFs, we have 𝑓𝑡 − 𝑠𝑡 = 𝐸𝑡 [𝑚𝑡+1 ] + 0.5 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑡 (𝑚𝑡+1 ) − 𝐸𝑡 [𝑚𝑡+1 ] −
0.5 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑡 (𝑚𝑡+1 ). Using the time t expectation of (5) in the right-hand side yields (6).

conditional variances of the log SDF’s that are linear in the model factors. If we assume a
(𝑔)

(𝑖)

country-specific factor 𝑧𝑡 and a global factor 𝑧𝑡 , then we can write country i’s conditional
variance as
(𝑖)

(𝑔)

(𝑖)

𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑡 (𝑚𝑡+1 ) = 2 𝑙 (𝑖) 𝑧𝑡 + 2𝑔(𝑖) 𝑧𝑡

for constants 𝑙 (𝑖) and 𝑔(𝑖) (the 2 is a normalization). Suppressing the superscript for US
variables, we can therefore write a country’s excess return from (7) as
(𝑔)

(𝑖)

𝑠𝑡+1 − 𝑓𝑡 = 𝑙 𝑧𝑡 − 𝑙 (𝑖) 𝑧𝑡 + (𝑔 − 𝑔(𝑖) )𝑧𝑡

(8)

+ 𝜖𝑡+1 .

7.1 Interpreting the Panel Regressions
Under the assumptions of the theoretical model, equation (8) represents the structure of
the panel regressions in Tables 5 and 6, if we assume a simplified setting with a single subject
(𝑖)

country forecasting variable 𝑧𝑡 , a single US forecasting variable 𝑧𝑡 (which is unrelated to the
(𝑔)

log SDF volatility of the subject country), and a single global forecasting variable 𝑧𝑡

common

to the US and subject country. In equation (6), country-specific variables forecast returns via
their effect on the precautionary savings demand of their home country. The global factor 𝑧 (𝑔)
affects both countries’ precautionary savings demand, and will only forecast returns to the extent
that this effect is asymmetric (i.e. 𝑔 ≠ 𝑔(𝑖) ).
For example, we can interpret the forecasting power of cpiYOY (positive) and cpiYOYUS
(negative) in light of equation (8) if each inflation measure is associated with a lower
precautionary savings demand in its own country, i.e., 𝑙 (𝑖) , 𝑙 < 0. Perhaps in our sample, which
excludes high inflationary episodes and especially for DMs, higher inflation is associated with
strong economic conditions and therefore lower precautionary savings. As we already
50

mentioned, these signs are the opposite of the prediction under Purchasing Power Parity and
slow nominal exchange rate responses.
When forecasting power of a global variable goes from zero to negative significant, as is
the case for exFedRate and CBexFed from the early to the late subperiod in DMs, we can
interpret this as a change from 𝑔 = 𝑔(𝑖) in the early subperiod to 𝑔 < 𝑔(𝑖) suggesting that nonUS countries became more sensitive to the monetary policy of the ECB, BOE and BOJ in the
later subperiod assuming that 𝑔(𝑖) , 𝑔 > 0 (tighter policy leads to higher precautionary savings).
Furthermore, equation (8) provides justification for our result that Fed and CBexFed both
do not forecast exchange rate returns against non-dollar base currencies. When looking at the
return of currency i against currency j (as opposed to the dollar) the 𝑔 coefficient in (8) becomes
𝑔(𝑗) . If these loadings are similar across non-dollar countries, i.e. if for all i and j 𝑔(𝑖) ≈ 𝑔(𝑗)
(𝑔)

then 𝑧𝑡 will not forecast returns against non-dollar base currencies, but it will forecast returns
against the dollar as long as 𝑔(𝑖) ≠ 𝑔. This is the fact pattern we document in Section 4.6.
7.2 Interpreting Different Carry Regimes
As can be seen from Table 5 (DMs) and Table 6 (EMs), with respect to changes in the
carry variable, we identify three different currency return regimes in our data:
1. For DMs in the early part of the sample, carry positively forecasts currency returns.
2. For DMs in the late part of the sample, carry becomes negative though not significant.
3. For EMs, the carry coefficient is positive, but small in magnitude and not significant.
This is despite the fact that the carry trade is profitable for EMs (see Figures 4 and A5).

51

We analyze these findings in the context of equations (6) and (7) . The domestic one-period
1

(𝑖)

interest rate is given by 𝑦𝑡 = −𝐸𝑡 [𝑚𝑡+1 ] − 2 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑡 (𝑚𝑡+1 ) and the foreign interest rate is 𝑦𝑡
(𝑖)

1

=

(𝑖)

−𝐸𝑡 [𝑚𝑡+1 ] − 2 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑡 (𝑚𝑡+1 ).42 In the standard power utility model with risk aversion 𝛾 and
identically and independently distributed consumption growth Δ𝑐𝑡 ,
𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑡 (𝑚𝑡+1 ) = 𝛾 2 × 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑡 (Δ𝑐𝑡+1 ),
and therefore 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑡 (𝑚𝑡+1 ) determines the precautionary savings component (which is negative
and serves to lower the interest rate) of the short rate.43
The interest rate differential, our 𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑦𝑡 variable, can therefore be written as
(9)

(𝑖)

(𝑖)

𝑦
⏟𝑡 − 𝑦𝑡 = 𝐸𝑡 [𝑚𝑡+1 − 𝑚𝑡+1 ] + 𝐸𝑡 [𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 ],
𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑦𝑡

where we have used the result in (6). Assuming that carry captures some of the elements of the
factors in equation (8), and simplifying to exclude other variables for the moment, a version of
the regression in (8) where carry is the sole regressor takes the form:
(𝑖)

𝑠𝑡+1 − 𝑓𝑡 = 𝑎 + 𝑏(𝑦𝑡 − 𝑦𝑡 ) + 𝜂𝑡+1 .

(10)

This regression generates Figures A9-A11 (and the results in Table 11). Using (7), the carry
coefficient b is given by
(𝑖)

𝑐𝑜𝑣(𝐸𝑡 [𝑚𝑡+1 − 𝑚𝑡+1 ], 𝐸𝑡 [𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 ]) + 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝐸𝑡 [𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 ])
𝑏=
.
𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑦𝑡 )

(11)

These follow from exp(−𝑦𝑡 ) = 𝐸𝑡 [𝑀𝑡+1 ] = 𝐸𝑡 [exp(𝑚𝑡+1 )] and the lognormality of the SDF.
Note that 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑡 (𝑚𝑡+1 ) can also be driven by heteroscedasticity in the return of the total wealth portfolio under the
Epstein-Zin (1991) SDF, or by changing local risk-aversion in a habit model. We will use the “precautionary
savings” terminology throughout because it is succinct, but there can be other effects in 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑡 (𝑚𝑡+1 ).
42
43

52

where from (6) we have that 𝐸𝑡 [𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 ] = 1⁄2 [𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑡 (𝑚𝑡+1 ) − 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑡 (𝑚𝑡+1 )]. The b coefficient in
(𝑖)

(11) can be positive or negative depending on the covariance term in the numerator. To gain
intuition for the sign of this term, note that 𝐸𝑡 [𝑚𝑡+1 ] proxies for expectations about next period’s
log marginal utility of consumption (relative to the current period’s). We can therefore think of a
high (low) value of 𝐸𝑡 [𝑚𝑡+1 ] as indicating a weak (strong) domestic economy. Under the
interpretation that 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑡 (𝑚𝑡+1 ) proxies for precautionary savings demand, we expect this term to
be countercyclical as well, since investors choose to save more during bad times. We can now
interpret the three possible carry regimes in light of the model.
Regime 1. For DMs, in non-stressed (pre-2007) times, we interpret recessions as being largely
idiosyncratic in nature, i.e., affecting only the US or the foreign economy but not both. In this
(𝑖)

(𝑖)

case, both 𝐸𝑡 [𝑚𝑡+1 − 𝑚𝑡+1 ] and 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑡 (𝑚𝑡+1 ) − 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑡 (𝑚𝑡+1 ) (recall that the latter equals
2𝐸𝑡 [𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 ]) should reflect the relative economic conditions of the US versus the foreign
economy. If the US is doing worse than the subject country, and if doing worse results in both a
higher marginal utility of consumption in the US, and higher precautionary savings in the US,
(𝑖)

then the carry variable against the subject country will be positive, then 𝐸𝑡 [𝑚𝑡+1 − 𝑚𝑡+1 ] and
𝐸𝑡 [𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 ] will be positively correlated, and b in (11) will be positive.
Regime 2. For DMs, in the post-crisis period, we found the carry coefficient to be negative. This
implies that the numerator of 𝑏 in (11) is negative, or44
(𝑖)

𝑐𝑜𝑣(𝐸𝑡 [𝑚𝑡+1 − 𝑚𝑡+1 ], 𝐸𝑡 [𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 ]) < −𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝐸𝑡 [𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 ]).

Since the absolute value of the correlation is under one, a necessary condition for this is 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝐸𝑡 [𝑚𝑡+1 −
> 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝐸𝑡 [𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 ]). Of the two components of carry in (9), under Regime 2, the expected difference in
marginal utilities must be the more volatile one.
44

(𝑖)
𝑚𝑡+1 ])

53

The relationship between expected relative marginal utilities and relative precautionary savings
(𝑖)

demands (i.e., the 𝐸𝑡 [𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 ] = 1/2[𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑡 (𝑚𝑡+1 ) − 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑡 (𝑚𝑡+1 )] term) must become strongly
negative in the second subperiod. As opposed to an idiosyncratic recession, in a global recession
we are looking at the covariance of the difference of two terms, and if for one country the
(𝑖)

(𝑖)

elasticities of 𝐸𝑡 [𝑚𝑡+1 ] and 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑡 (𝑚𝑡+1 ) with regard to the state of its economy are not the
(𝑖)

same, we can have a negative correlation between 𝐸𝑡 [𝑚𝑡+1 − 𝑚𝑡+1 ] and 𝐸𝑡 [𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 ]. For Regime
2 to hold, it is necessary that relatively high marginal utility be associated with relatively low
precautionary savings. We may expect that countries that are doing relatively better in growth
will have lower marginal utility. Under Regime 2, it is also true that they will have higher
precautionary savings demands.45
Regime 3. For the EM results, one must reconcile the fact that the carry trade is profitable with
the fact that the carry coefficient in Table 6 is of much smaller positive magnitude that the DM
early subperiod coefficient in Table 5, which is true for EMs in both subperiods. From equation
(6), the unconditional risk-premium of a currency against the dollar depends on the average
(𝑖)

difference in precautionary savings demands, i.e., 𝐸[𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑡 (𝑚𝑡+1 ) − 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑡 (𝑚𝑡+1 )], between the
US and the foreign economy. From (9), we see that the average interest rate differential between
the US and the foreign country depends on the average difference of precautionary savings
demands through the 𝐸𝑡 [𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 ] term, but also on the average difference between log marginal
(𝑖)

utilities. If the average value of 𝐸𝑡 [𝑚𝑡+1 − 𝑚𝑡+1 ] is similar across countries, then crosssectional variation in carry differentials will be driven by the average value of 𝐸𝑡 [𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 ], and

For a related discussion of the sign of the carry coefficient in a general equilibrium setting, see Backus et al.
(2010) and Benigno, Benigno and Nistico (2012).

high interest rate differential countries will have high expected returns (a country risk
characteristic) while low interest rate differential countries will have low expected returns.
But how can the 𝑏 coefficient in (10) be close to zero? For this to happen, we need the
(𝑖)

unconditional variance of 𝐸𝑡 [𝑚𝑡+1 − 𝑚𝑡+1 ] to be high relative to the unconditional variance of
𝐸𝑡 [𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 ] because the former shows up in the denominator of 𝑏 in equation (11) but it appears in
the numerator only through the correlation term, which needs to be small. Effectively, to explain
the close-to-zero value of b one needs the currency risk premium relative to the dollar for EM
countries 𝐸𝑡 [𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 ] to be a constant country risk characteristic, and not a conditioning variable
having to do with relative economic conditions, as it is for DMs.
7.3 A Simple Empirical Test of the Model
Note that the variance of 𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑦𝑡 in equation (9) is given by
(𝑖)

𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑦𝑡 ) = 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝐸𝑡 [𝑚𝑡+1 − 𝑚𝑡+1 ]) + 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝐸𝑡 [𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 ])

(12)

(𝑖)

+ 2𝑐𝑜𝑣(𝐸𝑡 [𝑚𝑡+1 − 𝑚𝑡+1 ], 𝐸𝑡 [𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 ])
While the b coefficient in (11) and the variance of 𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑦𝑡 in (12) can be thought of as an average
over the population of countries, we can also think of each of these quantities at the country
level. The cross-section of b’s and 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑦𝑡 )’s, shown for DMs in the left chart of Panel A of
Figure 7, gives a simple empirical test of the model as we now discuss.
Regime 1. If in idiosyncratic recessions the covariance term in (11) and (12) is indeed positive,
then this implies a large-cross sectional variation in 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑦𝑡 ) because the cross-sectional
(𝑖)

variation in 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝐸𝑡 [𝑚𝑡+1 − 𝑚𝑡+1 ]) and 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝐸𝑡 [𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 ]) gets amplified in the carry variance. In
this case, we expect the b’s and 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑦𝑡 )’s to be weakly negatively correlated (since
55

𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑦𝑡 ) shows up in the denominator of b). This is exactly what we see in the early part of
the sample in the top left chart of Figure 7.
Regime 2. If the covariance term in (11) and (12) is on average negative in periods of global
(𝑖)

recession, then the cross-sectional variation in in 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝐸𝑡 [𝑚𝑡+1 − 𝑚𝑡+1 ]) and 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝐸𝑡 [𝑟𝑥𝑡+1 ]),
i.e., the cross-country differences in these time series variances, gets dampened in 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑦𝑡 )
and we expect the variance of carry to have relatively little cross-sectional variation. In this case
the numerator of (11) is the dominant driver of cross-sectional variation in the b’s, which renders
the b’s positively correlated with 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑦𝑡 ) because the numerator of b is contained in the
variance of carry in (12). Both of these predictions, i.e., the small cross-sectional variation in
𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑦𝑡 ) and the positive correlation between this and the b’s, are evident for the later
subperiod in the top-left chart of Figure 7.
Regime 3. Since we have argued that for EMs the b coefficient in (10) is close to zero, we don’t
expect to see much cross-sectional variation between the b’s and 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑦𝑡 ). Indeed from the
left chart in Panel B of Figure 7 this is what we see.
7.4 Explaining Factor Decompositions: Future Research Directions
As shown by Lustig et al. (2011, 2014) and Verdelhan (2018) currency models of the
form in equation (5) imply a specific process for the dollar RX and carry HMLFX factors. Using
these, the currency return in equation (8) can be restated in term of a factor model with RX,
HMLFX and an appropriately defined residual term, i.e., our empirical specification in (4). Our
results in Tables 9 and 10 on decomposing variable predictability into factor and idiosyncratic
channels can then be analyzed in the context of that model. In future research, we plan to employ
this approach to shed light on the findings of Tables 12 and 13.
56

In particular such an analysis could shed light on the facts about coefficient changes and
their relationship to factors that we learn in Tables 12 and 13. There are important differences
between DMs and EMs in the role of the dollar factor in driving the regression results. We find
that in DMs and EMs in both subperiods monetary policy predictors of exchange rate returns
operate mainly through the dollar factor.
More generally, what is called for is a structural economic model that can endogenously
generate the currency risk premium dynamics that we have laid out in this discussion. Which of
the workhorse asset pricing models, and which elements of those models (long-run risks, habits,
or time-varying disaster probability), works best to reconcile the model to the data?

8. Conclusion
We construct a forecasting model of exchange rate returns for separate samples of
developed and emerging economies. Our model includes text-based measures of monetary policy
stance, as well as a wide range of variables that capture other influences, which draw from the
evidence previously reported in a wide range of studies.
To summarize, we make several contributions to the literature. (1) Our forecasting model
integrates measures of monetary policy change with real exchange rate influences, and other
relevant influences. (2) We measure monetary policy using a text-based measure, obtained from
Prattle, and find that this has much more important predictive value for exchange rate returns in
the post-2007 period. (3) Monetary policy by the major non-US central banks becomes much
more responsive to risk in the post-2007 period. (4) We show that there are important spillovers
from central bank policies for currencies other than their own, especially in the post-2007 period.
(5) We connect the predictive power of forecasting variables, including monetary policy, to
57

dollar and carry factors, and show that monetary policy spillovers operate mainly through the
dollar factor. This spillover effect, however, does not reflect the predictive role of non-US
central banks for forecasting US monetary policy, and likely reflects the connection between
non-US central bank policy stances and the global economy, which matters for the demand for
dollars. (6) Further corroborating that interpretation, we show that the predictive power of
monetary policy for future exchange rates is only present when the US dollar is used as the base
currency, suggesting a unique role for the dollar in the transmission of global monetary policy
shocks. (7) We show that carry trade profitability in emerging and developed economies is
driven by different influences; in emerging economies interest rate differences reflect persistent
country risk characteristics, while in developed economies they may reflect interest rate
differences produced largely by influences that boost foreign demand for capital (e.g., an
economic expansion in the high carry country prior to 2007, and by different influences later).
(8) We find that the carry reversal after 2007 that has been documented in prior work was
confined to developed economies, and that it potentially reflected savings differences in the years
after the global financial crisis. (9) We show that our main findings, including monetary policy
spillover effects and differences across countries and across time in the relation between interest
differentials and exchange rate changes, can be understood as reflecting changes in risk pricing
from the perspective of a no-arbitrage asset pricing model. (10) We examine whether the activist
and novel monetary policy after 2007 increased forecasting uncertainty, and find no evidence
that it did, suggesting that central banks pursuing discretionary policy were able to communicate
their intentions reasonably well to the market despite the absence of adherence to rules.
We emphasize two overarching conclusions from our various findings. First, changes in
risk and the pricing of risk are central to monetary policy stances of the major central banks, to
58

modeling exchange rate changes, and to understanding the persistent profitability of the carry
trade in EMs and the carry trade reversal in DMs. Second, one cannot properly model the
exchange rate of one currency without modeling all currencies. In particular, when considering
how cross-border influences affect currency values it is important to take into account the
influence of dominant developed countries’ central banks on exchange rates not directly related
to their own currency. Finally, the majority of global monetary policy influence on exchange
rates operates through the US dollar.

Figure 1: The short-rate ranges from a 6-month to a 2-year yield on government bonds
(Bunds are used for the ECB). The Prattle series is shown as a cumulative sum of monthly
Prattle scores, scaled to have the same range of values as the short-rate. In the case of
the Bank of England, the average monthly Prattle score was strongly positive, and so the
cumulative Prattle series has been detrended.

Figure 5: Rolling coefficients for forecasting regressions for 12-month returns. The model
is estimated in rolling 60 month windows using truncated 12-month returns data. Data are
demeaned at the country level in each 60 month window prior to running the elastic net.
Coefficients are estimated using an elastic net model implemented in the glmnet package
in R. We use cross-validation with 10 folds and the lambda.1se (maximally regularized)
version of the λ calculation.

Figure 7: The left charts show the forecasting carry coefficient b versus variance of interest
rate differential. The early subperiod is in blue (R2 shown at top), and the late is in red
(R2 shown at bottom). The right charts show the difference in carry coefficients across
samples (blate − bearly ) plotted against the ratio of second half to total capital inflows,
CFlate /CFall . The t-statistics use OLS standard errors. The early period runs from
January 1996 to October 2006, and the late subperiod starts in November 2006 and runs
to December 2016. Country names are suppressed in the lower left-hand chart to avoid
clutter.

Table 3: Summary of Prattle scores around quantitative easing (QE) events documented
in Fawley and Neeley (2013). The events range from March 2008 to December 2012. The
#Prattle column shows the number of Prattle events that occurred on the QE days identified by Fawley and Neeley (2013). The next three columns shows the mean, maximum
and minimum Prattle scores across these events. Chg10yr shows the change in the local
nominal 10-year government rate on the day of the announcements (we use Bund yields
for the ECB). ChgCCY shows the percent change in the currency’s dollar price on the
day of the announcement, and the return of the DXY index for the Fed.
