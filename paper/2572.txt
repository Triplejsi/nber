LABOR DEMAND AND THE STRUCTURE OF ADJUSTMENT COSTS

ABSTRACT

This study examines the nature of the costs that firms face in adjusting
labor demand in response to shocks induced by changes in output demand and
prices.

Empirical work on monthly plant-level time-series data shows that

adjustment proceeds in jumps:

Employment

is unchanged in response to small

demand shocks, but moves instantaneously to a new long-run equilibrium if the
shocks are large.

Results in the large literature that assumes smooth

adjustment are due to aggregation of this inherently nonlinear relation over

subunits experiencing different shocks.

The finding has implications

for

cyclical changes in productivity and for examining the effects of policies

such as severance pay, layoff and plant-closing restrictions, and mandatory
listing of job vacancies, all of which change the cost of adjusting employment.

I. Introduction

Most models of factor adjustment assume smooth paths from an initial to
a final equilibrium when the fundamental determinants of factor demand are
shocked.

Indeed, most tecent econometric work has even assumed that the

adjustment is characterized by a geometric lsg structure.

The purposes of

this study are to reexamine the theory underlying these assumptions, to
discover whether they make sense empirically, and to consider the implications

of alternative estimates that allow one to infer the structure of the costs of
adjusting labor demand.

Thia reexamination is necessary for several reasona.

It may be that

predictions of the paths of factor demsnd are unaffected by econometric
specificstiona that fail to embody the underlying structure of the adjustment
costs that face decision-makers at the firm level.

However, without specifying

snd estimating equations thst embody these structures we cannot know if this
is so.

Secondly, in most European countries, snd increasingly in the United

Ststes too, a variety of lsbor-msrket policies has been enacted in the past 15
years that can be characterized as affecting the sdjustment of labor demand)
Without knowing more about the structure of adjustment costs, we cannot link
specific policies to those costs in order to infer how the policies affect the
labor market.
I begin by examining the origins of the conventional wisdom about factor
adjustment, including issues of aggregation.

The section also discusses the

nature of labor costs and distinguishes between static costs and those
associated with mitering employment.

Next I analyze the optimal path of

employment under generalized costs of adjustment.

The inferences about the

adjustment paths are used to specify a set of estimating equations.

These

are studied using data on individual plants and then on longer time series on

highly dismggregated industries, The empirical analysis provides the first

Thus lismermesh (1969) examined gross

employment changes in this context; Brechling (1975) and Shapiro (1986) studied
simultaneous employment and capital-stock adjustment; Topel (1982) specified
inventories and employment as adjusting together; and Nadfri-Rosen

(1969)

included all of these decision variables in a model like (1).
All of these studies specify factor adjustment aa a simple distributed

justify s convex (quadratic) curve as an approximation that allows the

Subsequent theoretical work derived explicit paths for factor demand

Yet none of the leading studies (Eisner-Strotz, 1963; Gould,

1968) provides much more justification for the assumption than do Holt etal.

More recent work just imposes the sasumption of quadratic variable and zero
fixed adjustment costs with no discussion of why this representation of the
atructure may be correct (e.g., Sargent, 1978, p. 1016).

Indeed, the assumption

that this particular structure characterizes the world has found its way down

to intermediate macroeconomics texts (Froyen, 1983, p.

Obviously there

However, its exclusion of

fixed costs and its insistence on increasing average variable adjustment coats
are very restrictive and not necessarily consonant with reality.
In the literature on labor demand only Nickell (1986, and some of his
earlier work) recognizes that increases or decreases in employment may be
characterized by average variable costs of adjustment that are initially
decreasing but eventually increasing.

He derives the firm's dynamic demand

for labor under both the standard assumption of increasing variable costs and
the assumption of constant costs.

Does reducing employment by eliminating a shift

Do morale problems arise among the

These questions suggest that the structure of the costs of

adjusting employment levels need not be convex and may affect the path of
employment just as much as the "ore visible costs of gross employment changes.

for the other four plants too.

This inference contrasts sharply with the

appearance of the data aggregated over the seven plants, shown in the last
plot.

There are continuous fluctuations in employment, and these roug)üy

coincide with the fluctuations in output.

The first seven plots are quite

inconsistent with a model of smooth fluctuations in employment based on convex
variable adjustment costs; the last plot appears consistent with such a model.
While these figures tell much of the story, they cannot tell us whether
the underlying relationship between the logarithms of employment and output
(L and Y) are consistent with the static theory of production; nor can they
provide us with insights into the size of the shock, K, that is necessary to
induce the firm to change employment in the plant.

The estimates of K are quite large, implying that the firm will change

Consider what an estimate this large means.

Unless demand is very slack in these plants, the increases in product demand
that occur are met by combinations of greater effort and increased hours per
worker.

This inference is corroborated by the knowledge that there are

large variations in overtime hours in the industry to which these plants
belong.

With very large changes in product demand, though, firms respond by

non-marginal changes in employment.

This is the same sequence of responses

that is implicit in standard views of how firms adjust.

However, the standard

view that employment is adjusted marginally is inconsistent with these data.

though, shows that it is unlikely at most times that the firm is

choosing to change employment.
Recall that these estimates are based on employment levels, and thus,
like the theory in Section III, implicitly on costs of net adjustment.

We do

know, though, that voluntary turnover in the four-digit SIC industry to which
these plants belong averaged .8 percent per month in the late 1970s.'4

If,

as seems likely, this fairly large monthly outflow occurs repeatedly in the
same jobs, we may conclude that either that variable hiring costs are not very
important to this firm or, more tikely, that they are not convex and that the
fixed costs of hiring are small.

Clearly much of what is occurring in these data is temporary

Much, though, also reflects permanent changes in the level of staffing,

for example, in Plants 2 through S at various points during the sample.

Even if

all the discontinuous employment changes represented temporary layoffs, we would
still have learned much from examining these employment and output data.

Concluaiona, and Implications for Macroeconomic Adjustment and
Labor-Market Policy
I have demonstrated on data for a particular set of individual plants

that the standard model of convex variable adjustment coats is quite inferior
to a specification based on adjustment costa that are fixed. For data on saall
U.S. manufacturing induatres, and for data aggregated over a number of plants

of one manufacturing company, it is more difficult to discriminate between the
two models.

Clearly, the particular form of adjustment coats that I have

All I have shown is that, as a summary of the Costs this

particular firm faces in the plants it operates, it is better :can that embodied

in the standard model.

Similarly, the lumpy employment adjustn'nt in these

plants may be quite atypical of industry generally; but no one has demonstrated

that smooth employment adjustment is typical.

Rather, smoothness has heretofore

been assumed rather than tested.
This study is the first attempt to compare different models of employment
adjustment
level,

It shows that fixed costs characterize adjustment at the plant

it may be that even at the level of decision-making by firma the

standard quadratic cost model is more appropriate,

The lumpy adjustment that

exists at the plant level may be consistent with the smooth adjustment of
shifts of workers across a number of plants operated by a single large firm,
Without additional testing on plants in other firma the question cannot be
answered.

Is it worth doing the additional data collection and research at

the appropriate micro level that might cement the abandonment of the standard
model?

After all, the standard model may describe aggregated data just as

well, it leads to simple linear decision rules, and it is much easier to
estimate.

Aside from a desire for completeness and correctness there are, I

believe, many reasons for an affirmative answer to this question.
The first relates to macroeconomic fluctuations in employment and
cyclical fluctuations in productivity.

Aggregation of individual firms'

behavior under the linear equation that is derived from the standard model
yields a linear equation characterizing aggregate employment dynamics.

equation iiplies labor hoarding but no special timing effects.

This

Yet there is a

long tradition in macroeconomics (Fair, 1969; Cordon, 1979) of including timing
effects in equations "explaining" cyclical productivity change to capture the
observation that productivity grows unusually slowly as the economy nears a
cyclical peak.

These are imposed in an ad hoc fashion; but they are
19

consistent with microeconomic structures characterized by fixed costs, so that
linear aggregation is impossible.

Abandoning the standard model requires

expanding models of macroeconomic employment adjustment to include information
about che distribution of sub-units (in the specification used here, the
distribution across (7a) and (7b)).

Indeed, for one specific probability

density function (the uniform) a mean-preserving

spread in demand shocks

decreases the aggregate response of employment to those shocks.16
Massive and rapid "shake-outs" of employment, such as occurred in 1974-75
and 1982, are also not predicted by the standard model.

They are, though,

quite consistent with a model with fixed costs in which the response to large
shocks is more rapid and disproportionately greater than to smaller shocks.

Slow adjustment has been linked (Nickell, 1979; Msmermesh, 1986b;
Abrsham-Houseman, 1987; Burgess, 1988) to the imposition of policies that, for
exsmple, make it harder for firms to shed labor through layoffs or plant
closings.

It is difficult to see how such policies impose an increasing

variable cost of adjustment.

Unemployment insurance benefits (that are not

fully offset by a lower supply price of labor) impose a linear variable cost of
adjustment on most employers.

Mandatory advance notification of massive

layoffs or of plant closings imposes a lump-sum cost that is effective under

most proposals only if the drop in employment exceeds some minimum.17

Other

proposed cost-increasing labor-market policies also are hard to analyze in the
context of increasing variable adjustment costs.

For example, requiring

employers to list all vacancies with the Employment Service, as has been
suggested in the United States (e.g., Lawyers' Committee, 1971, p. 99), and as
is the norm in some European economies, would impose some fixed costs and
linear variable costs.

Our

results and these observations

on the likely

structure of adjustment costs mean that we cannot readily use previous
empirical work to infer their likely impact.

20

Rather, as has been so fruitful

in the study of other effects of labor-market policies and social programs, it
will be necessary to model their costs carefully and estimate their impacts by
applying those models to microeconomic data.
These conclusions should give pause to researchers who worry about
complex structures of error terms characterizing dynamic factor adjustment

under the maintainedassumption that adjustment is Slow because of increasing
variable costs.

More

attention needs

to be paid to linking the maximizing

behavior that produces factor adjustment to the underlying atructure of
adjustment costs.

That linkage must be made at the micro level, aith

The unpublished output data were provided by Kenneth Armitsge of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. Unlike in the plant-level data,
theta is substantial seasonality in the output data for these industries.
(About one-third of the variation in output is accounted for by a simple
AR(l2) model.)
Despite this, the estimates presented in this Section are
based on seasonally unadjusted data to maintain comparability with the
previous Section. The inferences we draw about the inability to discriminate
between models of adjustment costs did not differ when the models were
reestimated using seasonally adjusted data on output.

With fixed adjustment costs, in a simplified model employment change
