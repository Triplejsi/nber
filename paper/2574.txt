Bubbles, Fads and Stock Price Volatility Tests:
A Partial Evaluation

ABSTRACT

This is a summary and interpretation of some of the literature on stock
price volatility that was stimulated by Leroy and Porter (1981) and Shiller
It appears that neither small sample bias, rational bubbles nor some
(198la).
standard models for expected returns adequately explain stock price
volatility. This suggests a role for some nonstandard models for expected
returns. One possibility is fads' models in which noise trading by naive
investors is important. At present, however, there is little direct evidence
that such fads play a significant role in stock price determination.

Nearly seven years have passed since the publication of the original LeRoy
and Porter (1981) and Shiller (1981a) volatility tests.

The number of papers

analyzing or developing volatility tests on stock prices has now grown to the
point that a nonspecialist may have trouble getting an even general sense of the
current state of the volatility debate.

This paper is intended to help such a

nonspecialist, by summarizing and interpreting the literature.
Section I summarizes the techniques and conclusions of some volatility tests
that assume constant expected returns.

Section II considers whether small sample

bias is likely to explain the excess stock price volatility found in most of the
studies summarized in section I.

The presence of near or actual unit root

nonstationarity in stock prices certainly causes substantial small sample bias in
the test in Shiller (l981a), and quite possibly in other studies that assume
stationarity.

Subsequent studies that explicitly allow for unit roots find

excess volatility that is typically an order of magnitude smaller than for
studies that assume stationarity- -but they do still tend to find substantial
excess volatility.

While not much is known on small sample bias in tests that

allow for unit roots, it does not seem that such bias explains the persistent
finding of excess volatility.
tests that do

Indeed, I present a little evidence that certain

find excess volatility have poor small sample power against

interesting alternatives.
The rest of the paper proceeds under the tentative conclusion that stock
prices are more volatile than can be explained by a standard constant expected
return model.

Section III considers explaining the excess volatility by adding

to the usual constant expected return stock price an explosive rational bubble
(Blanchard and Watson (1982), West (1987)).

For a variety of theoretical and

empirical reasons, this does not seem to produce a satisfactory explanation.

2

If bubbles are ruled out, so that any deviations from the constant expected
return stock price are trensitory, these deviations will give rise to predictable
variations in returns.

Section IV considers whether stock price volatility is

adequately explained by some standard models for expected returns.

The evidence

here is somewhat limited, but the answer appears to be no (Campbell and Shiller
(l987b), West (1988)),

This seems to be true at least in part because such

models do not generate sufficient variability in expected returns.
This suggests that it might be useful to consider some nonstandard models

interprets "fads" models as
arguing that trading by naive investors creates nondiversifiable risk that
sophisticated investors must take into account (Campbell and Kyle (1986), DeLong
et ml. (1987), Shiller (1984)). It follows that an appropriate model for

The fads literature is, however,

rather new, end has yet to model risk as precisely as have the traditional models
discussed in section IV.

There is little direct evidence that trading by naive

investors plays a substantial role in stock price determination.

Such evidence

as there is in favor of fads is largely indirect, and consists of negative
verdicts on traditional present value models.

Before turning to a detailed discussion, it is well to remind the reader
that this is a partial evaluation of volatility tests, in two senses.

imperfect aggregation of information can lead to seeming excess volatility of
stock prices.

I. Overview of Empirical Results

Table

I

summarizes the results of some volatility tests that assume constant

ex-ante returns.

To make this task manageable,

I

have limited myself to

empirical results that in my somewhat arbitrary opinion could be cast in the form
V/V*, where V measures the volatility of the market's forecast of fundamentals,

V* the volatility of the econometrician's measure of fundamentals, and V/V*>l
indicates excess volatility.

This means that while most of the papers cited

below test a number of implications of the model being studied,

I

will consider

only those tests that seem to me to be similar in spirit to the original LeRoy
and Porter (1981) and Shiller (1981a) comparison of the variance of a stock price
(V) to that of a certain function of dividends (V*).

My sense is that my

self-imposed restriction probably selects from the studies cited below the IBaS
rather than the more striking evidence: the equality tests in LeRoy and Porter

4
(1981) and Menkiw et al. (1985), for example, yield sharper results than dn the
inequality tests reported be low.

Analyses that supply neither new empirical nor

Monte Carlo estimates (e.g., Marsh and Merton (1986)) are ignored in this section
but will be discussed later.

exceeding a theoretical upper bound by orders of magnitude.

The statistical

significance of the excess volatility was, however unclear.

For example, LeRoy

and Porter (1981), using the asymptotic distribution, found a violation
significant at the five percent level in only one of their four data sets.

As is

evident from a glance at the estimates of V/V* for lines (6) on, allowing for

unit roots results in considerably smeller estimates of excess volatility.

It

seems that these initial tests tend to find spuriously large estimates, at least
if unit roots are present.
For the Shiller (198la) technique for calculating V/V' m
var(Pt)/var(Ptt),
reasons for this are developed ti Flavin (1983), Kleidon (1985,198Gb) and Msnkiw
at al. (1985),

consistently, Shiller's (1981a) procedure tends to produce finite sample
estimates that are spuriously high, with the bias likely to be quite pronounced
for the relevant sample sizes.

Kleidon (1985, pp2O-2l), for example, reports a

simulation with a sample size of 100 in which the population value of V/V* is .81
but the mean estimated value

The Marsh and Mertori (1986) nonstationary

example in which the sample estimate var(Pt)/var(Pt*) is greater than one with
probability one, for any size sample, might be interpreted as simply a
nonstationary limiting case of the biases noted by Flavin (1983) and Kleidon
(1985) (Mankiw et al. (l985)).l
While the logic of Flavin (1983) and Kleidon (1985) does not apply directly
to the Blanchard and Watson (1982) or LeRoy and Porter (1981) tests, the dramatic
fall in V/V* when unit roots are allowed suggests that similar arguments are
likely to be relevant for those tests.

Indeed, the Monte Carlo simulations in

Mattey and Meese (1986) Indicate that the Blanchard and Watson (1982) procedure
will tend to spuriously find V/V'>1 if unit roots are present but, as in
Blanchard and Watson (1982) (but not West (1988)), are not imposed.

Similarly,

Gilles and LeRoy (l987b, p64), seem to concede that biases similar to those in
Shiller (l981a) are probably present in LeRoy and Porter (1981).
This leaves open the question of whether these biases are so large as to
explain the entire excess of V over V* reported in the various tests in Table I
Whether they even totally explain the Shiller (l981a) results is debatable.

sear to me to argue for the plausibltty of tha tests that find excess
volatility.

Specifically, the "1" and "0" entries in rows (t) and (7)) tand to

result when axpactad returns of less than 4 percent are assumed.

Expected

returns closer to the actual sample mean of about 8 percent result in the larger,
and statistically more significant, figures in these rows.

More importantly, as

documantad below, the K1sdon (line (10)) and LeRoy and Parke

tests,

which stand out from the other entries in the Table fot finding little or no
axocas volatility, appear to have poor power against a Shiller (1984) "feds'

volatility tests (Shillar (1984)), the Klaidon (line (10)) and LeRoy and Parka
(line (11)) results are not persuasive avidanos that the results of other tests
are misleading.
The saoond reason I think it unlikely that small sample bIases will overturn
the finding of excess volatility is that the other tests in Table I that allow
for unit roots do tend to find violations of the relevant varanoa bounds.

While

violations typically are an order of magntuda smaller than those of the
initial tests, they still ara numerically large. Since these tests directly

sample problems with the pepers in panel A, there does not seem to me to be a
reason to suppose any particular bias.

In fact, while there is of course some

small sample bias in these tests (Mattey and Meese (1986), West (1986,1988)), the
evidence on this does not suggest that such bias explains the excess volatility
that those tests tend to find.

See the entries for West (1988) in Table

I.

The rest of this section citains a small study of the power of the Kleidon
(line (10)) and LeRoy and Parke (line (11)) tests against a Shiller (1984) 'fads"
alternative, or, more generally, any alternative that generates slowly decaying
deviations of stock prices from the constant expected return price determined by
(4).

Moreover, this can be done with small or even no variations in ex-ante returns.

literature on bubbles, and then discussing some empirical results.
One immediate theoretical restriction on rational bubbles is that they
cannot be negative.

If

C<O and

the stock price is lower than its fundamental,

the possibility of an extraordinary capital gain when the bubble bursts must be
compensated for by a potential capital loss if the bubble continues to float
downward.

Since stock prices must be nonnegative, there will be, for any bubble

process, a low enough stock price that precludes any further capital loss.

Since

such a stock price is inconsistent with a bubble, so, too, is any higher stock
price than can lead to such a low stock price.

8y a backwards recursion, there

cannot be a negative bubble on a stock, because any such bubble leads to an
infeasible price with nonzero probability.
Are positive bubbles similarly inconsistent with rationality?

In models

where agents have infinite horizons, the answer appears to be yes (Tirole
(l982)).8

Any agent who sells a stock at a price higher than its fundamental can

exit the market, leaving negative present value for whomever buys it.

Bubbles

are ruled out when agents have infinite horizons even if traders have
differential information and if short sales are prohibited (Tirole (1982)).

16
Positive bubbles are not, however, ruled out in models with finite horizon

agents.

Tirole (1985) stodes this in a nonstochastic, perfect foresight,

overlapping generations model.

Each generation will be willing ro pay more than

fundamental value for an asset, provided the succeading generation is similarly
willing,

It is necessary that the hubble not inflate the stock price so fast

that stock market wealth ends up exceeding GNP (to take so extreoe example).
Otherwise, a backwards recursion will rule out bubbles.

Campbell and Shiller (l987c) further find little theoretically

and suggest (p35) that the smaller and less significant estimates of V/V* are

It

should be noted that both papers allow for unit roots, so that there is no
obvious reason to believe that small sample bias explains the excess volatility.

evidence to date does not suggest that traditional models of return determinetioo
successfully explain the seeming excess volatility of stock prices, even in
ronjunction with small sample bias.

flds
The tentative conclusion that neither rationsl bubbles nor traditional
models of return determination can explain stock price volatility suggests that a
nontraditional model for return determination might be required.

In "fads"

interpretations of the volatility tests, noise trading by naive investors plays a
significant role in stock price determination.

Shiller (1984) and DeBondt and

Thaler (1985) argue that psychologicsl and sociological evidence is consistent

with indiv±dusls following "Irrational" trading rules, overreacting to news.
Poteotslly, this both generates wide variations in expected returns and renders
inadequate traditional models for return determination.
-One

simple way to think through the possible sffects of fads is to add a

21
factor die to noise trsding to the level or log of whet would he the fundementel
price if expected returns were constent (Campbell and Kyle (1986), Poterba and

naive traders, another fraotton of trading is done by sophstioated fnvestnrs who

This does not

Such risk might not, however, be captured by traditional

of two seemingly identical assets to diverge.14
There is of course much anecdotal evidence of fads,

including the famous

Nore formal evidence consistent with

stories of investor overreaction may be found in DeBondt and Thaler (1985, 1987)
and Lehmann (1987).

These papers find that abnormally high returns can be earned

by following a contrarian strategy of buying stocks that recently have had
relatively poor returns, shorting stocks that recently have performed well'5
See DeLong at al. (1987) and Camerer (1987) for additional examples.
At a more aggregativa level, a growing number of studies suggest that there
is a significant stationary component to stock prices (Lo and McKinley (1987),
Fame and French (1988), Poterba and Summers (1987)).

This component

(a

in

equation (12)) is associated with econometric predictability of stock returna,
using variables such as lagged dividend-price ratios or earn1ngs

The

predictability is particularly marked at long horizons, say, over two years
(Campbell and Shiller (1987c), Fama and French (1987,

1988), Flood at al.

(1986)).
Poterba and Summars (1987) and Shillar (1984) interpret this as evidence of
slowly mean reverting fads.

But the only unambiguous interpretation of evidence

that stock prices do not follow a random walk is that expected returns are time
varying.

Whether or not the studies just cited imply movements in expected

returns that can best be explained by fads is debatable (Fama and French (1987));
one can trivially define

an

equation (12) as simply the log of the ratio of

the stock price (15), with returns determined by some standard modal, to a
constant expected return price.

So evidence of a stationary component

This applies as well to Campbell and Kyle (1986), a fully

23
articulated empirical study that allows for fads.

It estimates an explicit model

of tradiog by sophisticated Investors, when a residual ooise process affects
stock prices.

It finds that the noise process accounts for over one fourth of

stock price movements in the S and P data, 1871-1984, but does not present any
evidence that this process results mainly from trading by naive investors.

up in the presence of a logarithmic random walk (Merton (1985)).

See Flood and Hodrick (1987), Obstfeld and Rogoff (1986), and Smith

(1987) give any evidence on the accurscy of their linearizations.

West's (1988)

in particular is unlikely to be very reasonable in the presence of unit roots,
14.

It should be noted that in this interpretation of fads, many of the

traditional tools of financial analysis are still applicable, with the presence

of nciae trading an additional constraint facing rational investors.

It

therefore seems extreme to conclude (Kleidon (l986a), Merton (1985)) that we can
allow for fads only by iioring much of our accumulated knowledge about finencisi

See Shiller (1986a).
