Asset Price Bubbles and Systemic Risk

NBER Working Paper No. 25775
April 2019
JEL No. E44,G01
ABSTRACT
We analyze the relationship between asset price bubbles and systemic risk, using bank-level data
covering almost thirty years. Systemic risk of banks rises already during a bubble’s build-up
phase, and even more so during its bust. The increase differs strongly across banks and bubble
episodes. It depends on bank characteristics (especially bank size) and bubble characteristics, and
it can become very large: In a median real estate bust, systemic risk increases by almost 70
percent of the median for banks with unfavorable characteristics. These results emphasize the
importance of bank-level factors for the build-up of financial fragility during bubble episodes.

Introduction
Financial crises are often accompanied by a boom and bust cycle in asset prices (Borio and

Lowe, 2002; Kindleberger and Aliber, 2005). Bursting asset price bubbles can have detrimental
effects on the financial system and give rise to systemic financial crises. Yet, not all bubbles are
equally harmful. Some, like the one preceding the Great Financial Crisis, contribute to the collapse
of the entire financial system, while others, like the dotcom bubble, cause high financial losses
without any wider macroeconomic consequences.
Historical evidence suggests that the severity of crises after the burst of a bubble depends
on the state of the financial system. Bubbles accompanied by strong lending booms tend to be
followed by more severe crises (Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor, 2015b; Brunnermeier and Schnabel,
2016). Moreover, disturbances may be amplified through the financial sector. For example, the
US subprime mortgage market accounted for only 4 percent of the total US mortgage market at
the time of the burst of the subprime bubble (Brunnermeier and Oehmke, 2013, p. 1223). Yet,
this burst gave rise to one of the largest financial crises in history, because the initial shock was
amplified by the imbalances that had built up in the financial sector.
While the impact of asset price bubbles on macroeconomic variables is well-documented
(Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor, 2013, 2015a,b), little is known about the role of individual financial
institutions in the build-up of systemic risk during asset price bubbles. However, this knowledge
is crucial to understand the channels through which asset price bubbles affect systemic risk and to
design appropriate policy responses. Moreover, a single systemically important financial institution
can play a critical role in a financial crisis, just like Lehman Brothers did in the Global Financial
Crisis. Hence, not only the overall size of financial sector imbalances during asset price bubbles
matters but also the allocation of risks across banks.
We fill this gap in the literature by empirically analyzing the relationship between asset price
bubbles and systemic risk at bank level. Our analysis covers stock market and real estate bubbles in
17 countries over almost thirty years, focusing on the role of banks’ size, loan growth, leverage, and
maturity mismatch. Moreover, we analyze the role of bubble characteristics, namely their length
and size.

1

Measuring systemic risk at bank level yields additional insights compared to employing a
binary indicator of financial crises for three reasons. First, it allows us to analyze the changes in
systemic risk across banks during asset price bubbles in addition to the aggregate level of systemic
risk. This is important because financial crises are often not merely the result of macroeconomic
shocks but are reinforced by contagion effects within the financial sector, for which a small number
of banks often play an important role. Second, using continuous measures of systemic risk raises the
statistical power of our estimates due to their variation over time and across banks, whereas banking
crises are rare events. Third, systemic risk measures are useful from a conceptual perspective.
Unlike a financial crisis dummy, they also account for episodes of high financial fragility that did
not result in a crisis. In fact, increased systemic risk predicts future declines in real activity
(Allen, Bali, and Tang, 2012; Engle, Jondeau, and Rockinger, 2015; Giglio, Kelly, and Pruitt, 2016;
Brownlees and Engle, 2017), which points towards costs of financial fragility independent of whether
the risks materialize. Hence, regulation should care about episodes of high systemic risk due to
their crisis potential and the real effects of financial fragility.1
Our analysis is based on a broad, bank-level dataset spanning the time period from 1987 to
2015. The dataset contains monthly observations on 1,264 financial institutions. The empirical
analysis models banks’ contributions to systemic risk, or banks’ exposures to systemic risk, as
a function of financial bubbles as well as bank- and country-level characteristics. Our analysis
distinguishes between the boom and bust phases of bubble episodes to analyze both the build-up
of asset price bubbles as well as their bursting. We allow the effect of bubbles to depend on bank
characteristics (bank size, loan growth, leverage, maturity mismatch) and on bubble characteristics
(boom and bust length and size) to account for the heterogeneity across banks and bubble episodes.
The key challenges for our analysis are twofold. First, bubble episodes need to be identified. Asset price bubbles that were followed by deeper turmoil when bursting have attracted
most attention in the literature. Relying on such bubbles could, however, lead us to overestimate
the relationship between asset price bubbles and systemic risk. To prevent this sample selection
bias, we instead estimate bubble episodes by applying the Backward Sup Augmented Dickey-Fuller
1

Moreover, the estimation of the systemic risk measures applied in this paper is based on equity return losses,
which also capture the intensity of financial crises (Baron, Verner, and Xiong, 2018).

(BSADF) approach introduced by Phillips, Shi, and Yu (2015a,b). This approach identifies bubble
episodes based on episodes of non-stationary behavior in price data. We also consider price-to-rent
and price-to-dividend data to account for fundamentals. Additionally, we apply an alternative
bubble identification approach proposed by Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2015b), which relies on
price deviations from trends.
The second challenge lies in the quantification of systemic risk at bank level. We apply
∆CoVaR (conditional value at risk) introduced by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016) and the
marginal expected shortfall (MES) proposed by Acharya, Pedersen, Philippon, and Richardson
(2017). Both measures quantify systemic risk at bank level, while taking a complementary perspective. ∆CoVaR quantifies the contribution of a financial institution to the overall level of systemic risk by estimating the additional value at risk (VaR) of the entire financial system associated
with this institution experiencing distress. Hence, this measure thinks of banks as risk inducers.
Contrary to this perspective, MES treats banks as risk recipients by calculating the equity losses
of a bank conditional on the financial system experiencing distress.
Our results are in line with the common conjecture that asset price bubbles pose a threat to
financial stability. As summarized in Figure 1, asset price bubbles of median length and size go
along with a significant increase in systemic risk for banks of median size, loan growth, leverage,
and maturity mismatch (light blue bars). This increase in systemic risk is not limited to the turmoil
following the burst of a bubble, but exists already during its build-up phase. To prevent financial
fragility resulting from asset price bubbles, it may thus be advisable to counteract the risks building
up in the financial system early on.

[Figure 1 about here]

Moreover, the increase in systemic risk depends strongly on bank characteristics (grey bars)
and somewhat less on bubble characteristics (dark blue bars). During the bust phase of a bubble
with median bust size and length, the systemic risk contribution of a bank with unfavorable bank
characteristics increases by 54 percent of the median of ∆CoVaR. Bank size is the most important
determinant of this increase, underlining large banks’ potential to propagate and amplify shocks

3

from a bursting asset price bubble when getting under distress. High loan growth and a large
maturity mismatch also contribute to a larger increase in systemic risk, but to a smaller extent.
The findings regarding leverage are mixed and economically small. With respect to bubble characteristics, we find longer and larger bubbles to be associated with larger increases in systemic risk
during the boom phase. During the bust phase, the increase in systemic risk is smaller the more
time has passed since the burst and the more the bubble has deflated already. This points towards
a fading out of the effects of bursting bubbles.
The increase in systemic risk is largest during real estate busts, especially in case of unfavorable balance sheet characteristics: The 95th percentile of the increase in systemic risk in dependence
of balance sheet characteristics amounts to 55 percent of the median of ∆CoVaR, the 99th percentile to almost 70 percent. To further put the size of the effect into perspective, consider the
most prominent example of a single bank’s distress translating into a worldwide systemic financial
crisis, namely the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Shortly before its collapse during the bust phase
of the US subprime housing bubble in 2008, our estimates imply that systemic risk associated with
Lehman getting under distress would have been 40 percent lower if there had not been a bubble.
While the risks associated with stock market bubbles are smaller, the estimated increase in systemic
risk during these episodes suggests that stock market bubbles should not be disregarded either as
a potential source of financial fragility.
In order to check the robustness of our results, we apply different measures of asset price bubbles and systemic risk. Specifically, we normalize price series by rents and dividends, respectively,
in the BSADF test. Alternatively, we identify bubble episodes based on deviations of prices from
trends. As a second measure of systemic risk, we use MES to capture banks’ exposures to systemic
risk. The robustness checks confirm the rise of systemic risk in bubble episodes (although the result
on real estate bubbles is weakened for the trend-deviation approach) and the important role played
by bank and bubble characteristics. For MES, the relationship to specific bank characteristics
is different from ∆CoVaR due to the conceptual differences, but the overall relationship between
bubbles and systemic risk is again similar, with a strong role for bubble and bank characteristics,
especially bank size.

4

We additionally account for a potentially mechanical correlation between our bubble and
systemic risk measures and find that systemic risk increases less during stock market bubbles in
some specifications. When distinguishing between banks of different sizes, we show that both small
and large banks are affected to a similar extent. Moreover, neither a certain country nor a specific
time period is driving our main result that increases in systemic risk differ systematically across
banks and bubble episodes. Finally, accounting better for business cycles does not affect our main
results.
Overall, our results suggest that strengthening the resilience of the financial system at the
bank level may significantly decrease the system’s vulnerability to asset price bubbles. Moreover,
it may not be sufficient to intervene after a bubble has burst as a longer and larger bubble tends
to increase the build-up of systemic risk.
The paper proceeds as follows. We start with a brief discussion of the related literature and
our contribution in Section 2. Section 3 elaborates on the data, the identification of bubble episodes,
the estimation of systemic risk measures, as well as the empirical model. Section 4 contains our
baseline results, followed by a discussion of the results using alternative measures in Section 5.
Section 6 presents further robustness checks. Section 7 concludes. The Appendix provides further
details on the data, estimation procedures, as well as additional figures and tables.

Contribution to the literature
Our paper contributes to the strands of literature in macroeconomics and finance studying

asset price bubbles, systemic risk, and financial crises. Financial crises are frequently accompanied
by a boom and bust of asset prices in both developed and developing economies. Although the
corresponding narrative has been known for a long time (Minsky, 1982), the relationship between
asset price bubbles and systemic risk has hardly been analyzed empirically. Historical accounts
of prominent financial bubbles have been given, among others, by Shiller (2000), Garber (2000),
Kindleberger and Aliber (2005), Allen and Gale (2007), Reinhart and Rogoff (2009), as well as
Brunnermeier and Schnabel (2016). Our paper speaks to this literature by analyzing a large
number of asset price bubbles, based on a broad set of countries and a time period of almost thirty
years. It thus complements this literature with an econometric perspective.

5

The notion of systemic risk as a concept for financial stability appeared only in the late
1990s and early 2000s, which has given rise to a large literature attempting to measure systemic
risk at bank and system level, including Acharya, Engle, and Richardson (2012), Adrian and
Brunnermeier (2016), Brownlees and Engle (2017), as well as Acharya, Pedersen, Philippon, and
Richardson (2017). An early literature review of the concepts of systemic risk is provided by de
Bandt and Hartmann (2000). Bisias, Flood, Lo, and Valavanis (2012) provide a taxonomy and
discuss the advantages and drawbacks of different approaches. Allen, Babus, and Carletti (2012)
as well as Brunnermeier and Oehmke (2013) provide comprehensive reviews, also including the
theoretical literature. We draw upon this literature by applying established measures of systemic
risk and by analyzing asset price bubbles as a new driver of these measures. We also shed light
on the interplays between asset price bubbles and bank characteristics that have been shown to be
linked to systemic risk, such as bank size, leverage, and maturity mismatch.
Similarly, we build on the literature dealing with the identification of asset price bubbles by
applying some of the most prominent approaches. Many strategies are built around tests for nonstationary behavior in price data (Kim, 2000; Kim and Amador, 2002; Busetti and Taylor, 2004;
Breitung and Homm, 2012).2 One of the most prominent estimation procedures is the Backward
Sup Augmented Dickey-Fuller (BSADF) approach introduced by Phillips, Shi, and Yu (2015a,b)
and developed further by Phillips and Shi (2018). The quantitative procedures allow to objectify
the classifications. This reduces the selection bias inherent in historical accounts of bubbles and
financial crises, which tend to focus on the most severe events, because these were most likely to be
reported. We contribute to this literature by contrasting the results of the applications of several
conceptually different measures and by analyzing the relationship between the identified bubble
episodes and systemic risk.
We also draw upon the theoretical literature suggesting channels through which asset price
bubbles may give rise to financial instability. Bursting asset price bubbles can set in motion loss and
liquidity spirals, forcing distressed institutions to sell assets, thereby further depressing prices and

Early contributions were Shiller (1981), LeRoy and Porter (1981), West’s (1987) two-step tests, integration and
co-integration based tests as proposed by Diba and Grossman (1988), and tests for intrinsic bubbles as in Froot and
Obstfeld (1991). See Gürkaynak (2008) for a discussion of these approaches.

forcing additional asset sales. Through such dynamics, systemic risk may spread well beyond the
institutions affected by the initial shock. Brunnermeier (2009), Hellwig (2009) as well as Shleifer
and Vishny (2011) argue that it is exactly such dynamics that make risk systemic. Moreover,
already Bernanke and Gertler (1989) as well as Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1999) pointed
out that consequences of losses in net worth are usually long-lasting. Loss and liquidity spirals are
the subject of a large literature, including Shleifer and Vishny (1992, 1997, 2011), Allen and Gale
(1994), Kiyotaki and Moore (1997, 2005), Xiong (2001), Gromb and Vayanos (2002), Brunnermeier
and Pedersen (2009), Acharya, Gale, and Yorulmazer (2011), Acharya and Viswanathan (2011),
Diamond and Rajan (2011), as well as Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014).3 However, asset price
bubbles may not only trigger the materialization of financial imbalances. They can also cause
the build-up of these imbalances in the first place. Rising prices increase the value of borrowers’
collateral (Bernanke and Gertler, 1989) and the liquidity of assets (Kiyotaki and Moore, 2005),
causing banks to increase lending and reduce precautionary liquidity holdings. If the increases
in asset prices are due to a bubble, the increased lending might turn out to be excessive and
liquidity provisions may prove insufficient. Shin (2008) provides a model considering demand-side
and supply-side effects of asset prices on banks’ balance sheets and the ensuing effects on financial
institutions’ risk. To capture the role of asset price bubbles both in the build-up and in the
realization of financial risks, we consider the emergence of systemic risk in the boom phase as well
as the materialization of risk in the bust phase of the bubble.
The comparably small literature looking specifically at the relationship between asset price
bubbles and systemic risk has largely taken a macroeconomic perspective. Gertler and Gilchrist
(2018) describe how the recent theoretical and empirical literature can explain the developments
during the Great Recession. They also provide an empirical analysis, emphasizing the importance
of the disruption of financial intermediation relative to other contributing factors. Schularick and
Taylor (2012) and Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2013, 2015a,b) provide econometric analyses of
the impact of asset price bubbles on the likelihood and costliness of financial crises using long-run
historical data. Another broad strand of the literature deals with the role of monetary policy for the

(2010), and Gorton and Metrick (2012).

development of asset price bubbles and financial stability (see, for example, Bordo and Jeanne, 2002;
Galı́, 2014; Galı́ and Gambetti, 2015; Brunnermeier and Schnabel, 2016). By analyzing the role of
bank characteristics for the relationship between asset price bubbles and systemic risk, this paper
takes the analysis of bubbles from the macroeconomic to the microeconomic level while maintaining
a systemic perspective through its approach to the measurement of risk. This yields new insights
on the transmission channels between asset price bubbles and systemic risk and highlights the
heterogeneity of the increase in systemic risk across banks.

Data and empirical model

3.1

Data sources and sample
Our analysis relies on a number of data sources listed in Table C1, which also provides variable

definitions. The estimation of real estate bubbles is based on real house prices and rents provided
by the OECD. Stock market bubbles are estimated using country-specific MSCI price indices and,
in some cases, dividends recovered from MSCI return indices from Thomson Reuters’ Datastream.
These indices were chosen due to their broad coverage (85% of each country’s total stock market
capitalization) and the unified methodological framework, which makes them comparable across
countries.
For the estimation of systemic risk, we obtain daily information on the number of outstanding
shares, stock prices of common equity, and market capitalization from Thomson Reuters’ Datastream for all listed institutions. The control variables used in the estimation of ∆CoVaR are listed
in Table B1 in Appendix B. Bank balance sheet characteristics are taken from Bureau von Dijk’s
Bankscope. Finally, we use a large number of macroeconomic control variables.
The sample includes all countries for which we have data on both real estate and stock
markets. We keep all banks for which balance sheet information and sufficient return data for
the estimation of systemic risk contributions are available.4 The final sample contains monthly
4

We exclude all institutions with fewer than 260 weeks of non-missing equity return losses to ensure convergence
of the quantile regressions used during the estimation of systemic risk contributions.

observations on 1,264 financial institutions located in 17 countries, yielding a total of 165,149
observations.5

3.2

Measuring asset price bubbles
In order to identify asset price bubbles, we rely on the Backward Sup Augmented Dickey-

Fuller (BSADF) approach by Phillips, Shi, and Yu (2015a,b) and updated by Phillips and Shi
(2018), which is well established in the literature.6 It outperforms comparable approaches in terms
of size and power if multiple bubble episodes occur within a dataset, as is shown by the simulations
in Breitung and Homm (2012) and Phillips, Shi, and Yu (2015a). This property is valuable for our
study as the analyzed sample typically covers more than one bubble episode per price series. The
BSADF approach applies backward-expanding sequences of Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests
to subsamples of price data.
Figure 2 shows the recent Spanish housing bubble for illustration. The test identifies the
beginning of a bubble episode as the point in time at which the sequence of BSADF test statistics
(blue dotted line) first exceeds its critical value (red dotted line). It thus signals that the price
data (black line) is on an explosive trajectory. The end of a bubble episode is reached once the
test statistics fall back below their critical values. Appendix A provides a detailed description of
the estimation procedure.
In alternative specifications, we apply the approach by Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2015b)
who define a bubble as an episode in which prices are elevated relative to their trend and exhibit
a large price correction. Specifically, this approach first identifies episodes of price elevation whenever log real asset prices exceed their Hodrick-Prescott filtered trend by more than one standard
deviation. Afterwards, a price correction signal is defined to equal one whenever prices drop by
more than 15% within three years. Finally, a bubble is any episode of price elevation during which
the price correction signal equals one at least once.
5

As shown in Table C2 in the Appendix, the number of banks differs widely across countries. The number of US
banks is comparably large due to the high number of small publicly traded banks. This does not drive our results as
shown in the robustness check in Section 6.2, where we explore differences between large and small banks.
6
Applications can be found, e. g., in Gutierrez (2013); Bohl, Kaufmann, and Stephan (2013); Etienne, Irwin, and
Garcia (2014); Jiang, Phillips, and Yu (2015).

9

We distinguish between the boom and the bust phases of a bubble (see the blue and grey
shaded areas in Figure 2) based on the global peak of the price series during each bubble episode.
Hence, we construct four binary variables for each country, indicating episodes in which a real estate
or stock market bubble builds up or collapses, in order to capture differences across the phases of
the asset price cycle.7

[Figure 2 about here]

We apply the BSADF test to quarterly real house price data covering the period 1976 to 2016
and monthly observations of stock price indices covering the period 1973 to 2016. The data used
to estimate the bubble episodes go back further than the data used in the main analysis, which
improves the size and power of the BSADF test.8 Since the real estate data are available only at
quarterly frequency while our main analyses rely on a monthly frequency, the real estate bubble
indicators take on the value of the corresponding quarter for each month of the quarter.9
Asset price bubbles are often thought of as price deviations from fundamental values. To
account for this property, we additionally apply the BSADF approach to normalized price series,
i. e., real house prices divided by rents and stock prices divided by dividends. Unfortunately, the
availability of rent and dividend data is limited in the time dimension. The advantage of using the
normalized price series thus comes at the cost of lower size and power. Our main analyses therefore
rely on the BSADF estimates based on non-normalized price series.10
The dataset used in the regressions spans the time period from 1987 to 2015. It hence includes
not only the US subprime housing bubble, which marks the beginning of the global financial crisis,
but also many other bubble episodes, such as the dotcom stock market boom and bust around 2000,
7
Unlike the trend-deviation approach, the BSADF approach is entirely backward-looking. The boom-bust distinction introduces a forward-looking component. Our main results are robust towards dropping the boom-bust
distinction (see Table C3).
8
Its size distortions vary between 1 and 2.2 percentage points for sample lengths between 100 and 1,600 observations. The evolution of the size distortions over increasing sample lengths is U-shaped. The power of the test is
reported with 0.7 for T=100, 0.9 for T=200 and approaching 1 for T=1600 (Phillips, Shi, and Yu, 2015b).
9
The results are robust towards using quarterly data (see Table C4).
10
The results are virtually the same when using estimates based on the normalized price series (see Section 5.1).

or the real estate boom and bust cycles around 1990 in several countries.11 Table 1 provides an
overview of the number of bubble episodes resulting from the three different estimation strategies.
According to the BSADF approach, our sample comprises 33 real estate booms and 26 busts,
while it contains 45 stock market booms and 47 busts.12 On average, countries experienced 1.9
real estate booms, 1.5 real estate busts, 2.6 stock market booms, and 2.8 stock market busts.
The two alternative bubble identification strategies also find stock market bubbles to occur more
frequently than real estate bubbles. Using normalized data, the BSADF approach finds a lower
average number of stock market booms and busts per country (2.1 and 1.6) and an almost identical
average number of real estate booms and busts (1.9 and 1.6). The trend-deviation approach finds
fewer real estate booms and busts per country (1.2 and 1.3) and significantly more stock market
booms and busts (4.2 and 3.8).

[Table 1 about here]

Figure 3 displays the occurrence of booms and busts per country for our baseline bubble
estimates. Many stock market bubble episodes occur around the run-up to the global financial
crisis, the dotcom bubble, as well as the mid-1980s.13 Real estate bubbles appear to be much
more persistent, especially since the 2000s when most countries experienced a real estate bubble.
According to our estimates, real estate booms last on average five years, while the bust lasts only
one year. Stock market booms last on average less than two years, and the busts last only half
a year. The shorter lifespan of stock market bubbles is consistent with stock prices moving more
quickly than real estate prices. With the exception of the stock market bubbles between 2006 and
2008, the bubble episodes relying on normalized data generally identify similar yet shorter periods.
The stock market bubble episodes estimated using deviations from trend are again similar to those
identified by the BSADF approach. The largest differences are found for real estate bubbles in
11

The included countries are: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
12
The number of booms and busts differs if a bubble is already in the bust phase at the beginning of our sample
period, or if a bubble is still in the boom phase at the end of the sample used in the main analysis. We can estimate
these bubble episodes since the data used for bubble identification covers a significantly longer period than the data
used in the main analyses.
13
The results are not driven by episodes during which a lot of countries simultaneously experience a stock market
bubble (see Table C5).

11

the second half of the sample. These occur less frequently and are less persistent compared to the
bubbles estimated with the BSADF approach (see Figures C1 and C2 in the Appendix).

[Figure 3 about here]

On the basis of the estimated bubble episodes, we calculate the bubble characteristics length
and size. Length counts the number of months a bubble has been building up since its inception,
or that it has been collapsing since its peak. During the boom phase, size is the underlying asset’s
price relative to its pre-bubble level. During the bust, size measures the size of the bust (as opposed
to the size of the bubble) as the negative of the asset’s price series relative to the current bubble
episode’s peak level. Outside of the respective bubble phases, all length and size variables are equal
to zero.
Table 2 displays summary statistics of bubble characteristics during bubble episodes (i. e.,
conditioning on a bubble being identified). The general patterns are consistent across bubble
identification approaches. Real estate bubbles have on average been present for a longer time than
stock market bubbles, and booms are more persistent than busts. Stock market booms and busts
are on average larger than real estate booms and busts. Finally, the average size of a boom is
larger than the average size of a bust. Specifically, prices are on average 78% above the initial value
during a stock market boom, but only 38% during a real estate boom according to our baseline
BSADF approach. In a stock market bust, prices are on average 12% below the peak price, while
in a real estate bust, prices are only 6% below the peak.14

3.3

Measuring systemic risk
Our goal is to analyze the link between asset price bubbles and systemic risk at bank level.

There exists no single “correct” approach to quantify systemic risk at the micro level. In this paper,
14
Interestingly, the average bust size is very similar between our baseline BASDF estimates and the trend-deviation
approach even though the BSADF approach does not explicitly incorporate a bust criterion.

12

we rely on two prominent measures, ∆CoVaR (Adrian and Brunnermeier, 2016) and marginal expected shortfall (MES) (Acharya, Pedersen, Philippon, and Richardson, 2017).15 The combination
of both measures is appealing due to their complementary perspectives. ∆CoVaR regards banks
as “risk inducers” and quantifies the contribution of a financial institution to the system’s level of
systemic risk by estimating the additional value at risk (VaR) of the entire financial system associated with this institution experiencing distress. Contrary to this perspective, MES treats banks
as “risk recipients” and calculates the equity losses of a bank conditional on the financial system
experiencing distress.
In accordance with the above definition, ∆CoVaR can be written as
system|X i =V aRqi

∆CoV aRqsystem|i = CoV aRq

i
system|X i =V aR50

− CoV aRq

,

(1)

where Xi denotes the return loss of institution i and q refers to a percentile of the loss distribution.
The VaR is implicitly defined by P r(X i ≤ V aRqi ) = q%, and CoVaR is implicitly defined by
system|C(X i )

P r(X system ≤ CoV aRq

|C(X i )) = q%. Following Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016), we

estimate ∆CoVaR using quantile regressions.16 The estimation procedure is described in detail in
Appendix B.
MES is calculated as the average bank return during the 5% days during which the financial
system exhibited the worst losses during the past year. We use overlapping windows to obtain
monthly estimates. Denoting the set of trading days with the 5% worst system returns during the
past 12 months at month t as Zsystem

Alternative measures of systemic risk include the Option-iPoD (Capuano, 2008), the DIP (Huang, Zhou, and
Zhu, 2009), the measures introduced in Segoviano and Goodhart (2009) as well as in Gray and Jobst (2010), realized
systemic risk beta (Hautsch, Schaumburg, and Schienle, 2015), and SRISK (Acharya, Engle, and Richardson, 2012;
Brownlees and Engle, 2017).
16
For a detailed exposition of quantile regressions, see Koenker (2005). The literature suggests a number of
alternative estimation techniques: MGARCH (Girardi and Tolga Ergün, 2013), copulas (Mainik and Schaanning,
2012; Oh and Patton, 2015), maximum likelihood (Cao, 2013), and Bayesian inference (Bernardi, Gayraud, and
Petrella, 2013). All of these alternative approaches are less frequently applied than the quantile regression approach.

13

Both measures are based on tail correlations of equity returns. As for most other systemic risk
measures, the quantified relationship is non-causal. While the measures pick up causal spillovers
from one financial institution to the system (or vice versa in case of MES), they also capture
correlated shocks that affect many banks at the same time, for example, small banks being “systemic
as part of a herd”. The common idea underlying tail-correlation measures is that the functioning
of the financial system is likely to be impaired if a large number of banks experience distress at the
same time. Given this definition of systemic risk, banks’ common exposures to shocks are equally
relevant for financial stability as spillover risks. The ability of systemic risk measures to capture
both sources of systemic risk should hence be considered a virtue rather than a bug.
Table 3 provides summary statistics for ∆CoVaR and MES. The mean of ∆CoVaR equals
1.96 such that distress at one institution is associated with an average increase in the financial
system’s conditional value at risk of 1.96 percentage points based on weekly returns. The mean
of MES equals 1.34, meaning that, on average, a bank’s daily equity return was –1.34 percent on
days during which the financial system suffered severe market equity value losses. Figure 4 displays
the evolution of the average ∆CoVaR and MES in the four considered financial systems (North
America, Europe, Japan, and Australia) over time. Both measures evolve similarly. However,
∆CoVaR leads MES due to the use of a rolling window in the estimation of MES. Therefore, in
some regressions with MES, we lag all explanatory variables by 6 months. All four financial systems
show a marked peak in ∆CoVaR and MES at the time of the global financial crisis.17 Other times of
financial system distress, such as the euro area crisis or the Japanese banking crisis at the beginning
of the 1990s, are visible as well. In contrast, the dotcom episode is hardly reflected in the series.

3.4

Bank-level variables and macroeconomic controls
We include bank characteristics in our analysis that have been shown to drive an institution’s

systemic risk contribution, such as size (the logarithm of total assets), leverage (total assets divided
17

Despite its prominence, this crisis does not drive our results (see Section 6.3).

14

by equity), and maturity mismatch (short-term liabilities minus short-term assets, divided by total
assets). Additionally, we consider the role of loan growth (∆log(loans)), as credit-fueled bubbles
have been shown to be particularly harmful (Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor, 2015b; Brunnermeier
and Schnabel, 2016).18 We apply cubic spline interpolations to obtain monthly observations. The
bank-level variables enter the regressions winsorized at the 1 and 99-percent level to deal, for
example, with extreme leverage of defaulting institutions and high loan growth of institutions
starting from a very low loan level.
The median bank in our sample is small with total assets of around 1.9 billion US dollar, and
size varies greatly (Table 3).19 Average and median loan growth is close to zero, but our sample
contains many observations with high positive and high negative growth rates. The median bank
has a leverage of 12 and a median maturity mismatch of 0.75, again with a wide variation.
With respect to macroeconomic control variables, we observe a banking crisis during 36 percent of observations. Median real GDP growth and inflation are 2.3 and 2.1 percent. The median
10-year government bond rate is 4.5 percent and median investment-to-GDP growth is slightly positive. Looking at the 5th and 95th percentile of the distribution, we can see that the sample includes
severe recessions as well as strong booms, mirroring the diverse macroeconomic developments of
the 17 countries over the sample period of almost thirty years.

3.5

Empirical model
We regress systemic risk (measured by ∆CoVaR or MES) of institution i at time t on bank

fixed effects (αi ), the four binary variables indicating booms and busts in stock and real estate
Bubble ) in country c at time t, lagged bank characteristics, the interaction terms of the
markets (Ic,t

bubble indicators with bank and bubble characteristics, and the lagged country-specific macroeco18

The literature suggests that bank activities not related to lending may also be relevant (see, e. g., Brunnermeier,
Dong, and Palia, 2012). Therefore, we also included the ratio of non-interest rate income to interest rate income
in our regressions. However, this variable and its interactions with the bubble indicators are not significant in any
regression (see Table C6) and do not change any coefficient of the other variables significantly. Therefore, we disregard
this variable in the remainder of this paper.
19
In Section 6.2, we check whether the link between small and large banks’ systemic risk contributions and asset
price bubbles differs beyond what is captured by controlling for total assets.

Larger values of ∆CoVaR (MES) correspond to a higher systemic risk contribution (exposure). Hence, we expect a positive sign for all coefficients included in β, corresponding to an increase
in systemic risk during asset price bubbles. The relationship between bubbles and systemic risk is
likely to depend on an institution’s balance sheet characteristics, which is captured by the interaction terms. We expect a stronger relationship between bubbles and systemic risk for banks with
unfavorable bank characteristics. For instance, if a bubble is financed by loans, higher loan growth
raises a bank’s exposure to the bubble and should thus also raise its systemic risk contribution.
Similarly, the relationship may depend on bubble characteristics. For example, an emerging asset
price bubble might be more harmful the longer it has lasted already because it may feed back into
banks’ risk-taking and thereby become self-reinforcing. In contrast, after a longer bust phase, the
bubble may be less harmful because the shock fades out.
We do not include time fixed effects in the baseline regressions because these would absorb
part of the variation that we are interested in. To clarify the argument, suppose we had only
two countries in the sample that exhibit a bubble at the same time and banks experience the
same increase in systemic risk. With time fixed effects, the coefficients of the bubble indicators
would capture the change in systemic risk relative to the average of the two countries. Then, the
coefficients on the bubble indicators would suggest no change in systemic risk during asset price
bubbles (relative to the global average). In Section 6.1, we analyze the robustness of our results
with respect to time and country-time fixed effects and find that most results continue to hold.
We subtract the median from all bank-level variables and bubble characteristics such that the
coefficients on the bubble indicators can be interpreted as the change in systemic risk contributions

16

(or exposures) of a bank of median size, loan growth, leverage, and maturity mismatch during a
boom or bust of median size and length.
On country level, we include a banking crisis dummy, real GDP growth to capture national
business cycles, and inflation, which has been identified as a factor contributing to the occurrence of
financial crises (Demirgüç-Kunt and Detragiache, 1998).20 The 10-year government bond rates (in
logs) account for the nexus between sovereigns and banks. In a robustness check (not reported), we
use monetary policy rates instead, as extended periods of low rates can cause the build-up of risks
in the financial sector by driving banks into overly risky investments and inadequate risk buffers
(Diamond and Rajan, 2012).21 Our results are robust to the choice of the interest rate. Growth of
investment to GDP is included to control for the use of credit for investment versus consumption
(see Schularick and Taylor, 2012).
One concern in our empirical model could be reverse causality. This problem appears less
severe than in analyses at macroeconomic level because systemic risk contributions at bank level are
less likely to impact asset price bubbles than aggregate systemic risk. Nevertheless, it is plausible
that banks themselves play a role in the creation of asset price bubbles. Cheap financing during
a credit boom may lead to large real estate investments which may culminate in, or reinforce, a
real estate bubble. Since we explicitly control for banks’ loan growth, this would not bias our
results. To further alleviate the concern of reserve causality, we also control for a number of
other bank characteristics and, in some specifications, further lags of the explanatory variables.22
These precautions make it less likely that our estimates suffer from reverse causality. In another
robustness check, we estimate simple linear probability models and run Granger causality tests to
check whether ∆CoVaR or MES predict asset price bubbles. We do not find any indication of
reverse causality in these tests (see Tables C8 and C9). Nevertheless, we are conservative in the
interpretation of our results and speak of an increase in systemic risk during rather than due to
asset price bubbles throughout the paper.
20

In Section 6.4, we account for business cycles more extensively, but find our results to be highly robust.
Also see the discussion in the context of the recent financial crisis in Deutsche Bundesbank (2014).
22
Table C7 demonstrates that our results are also robust to using different lag structures.
21

Standard errors are clustered at bank and time level. The clustering at bank level accounts
for autocorrelation, including that introduced by interpolation of the data. The clustering at time
level allows error terms to be correlated across banks in all countries, which is important in light of
several countries experiencing asset price bubbles at similar times. Since the precise timing of asset
price booms and busts differs across countries, the bubble indicators show, however, variation in
the cross-sectional dimension even for those countries that experience asset price bubbles in similar
periods. The results are robust to alternative clustering of standard errors (see Table C10).

Results

4.1

Asset price bubbles and systemic risk in booms and busts
We start by illustrating the underlying conditional correlations without allowing for hetero-

geneous effects across banks. To this end, we regress ∆CoVaR on the bubble indicators, macroeconomic control variables, and bank fixed effects. The coefficients of all four bubble indicators are
positive and highly significant (Table 4, column 1). Overall, asset price bubbles are associated
with a significant increase in systemic risk, which is in line with our hypothesis. The strongest
relationship is found for real estate busts.
When looking at individual countries (results not reported), we find a significant positive
association between asset price bubbles and systemic risk for twelve out of 17 countries in our
sample. The relationship is insignificant in four countries and significantly negative only in a single
country and only in the boom period.23 Hence, the underlying correlation is pervasive in our sample
and not driven by individual countries.

[Table 4 about here]

When adding bank-level variables, the coefficients of the bubble indicators change, but the
signs and significance prevail (Table 4, column 2). The coefficients of real estate booms and busts
23

The negative correlation is found for asset price bubbles in Denmark. Insignificant correlations are estimated
for Switzerland, Germany, Portugal and Sweden. These results are obtained without distinguishing between asset
classes due to the low number of bubble episodes per country for each asset class.

decrease, while those on stock market booms and busts increase slightly. This may hint at a larger
relevance of bank characteristics during real estate bubbles compared to stock market bubbles,
which is explored further in the subsequent section.
The signs of the coefficients of macroeconomic control variables are largely in line with expectations. Systemic risk is significantly elevated during banking crises and decreases in real GDP
growth. Higher investment-to-GDP growth is negatively related to systemic risk. The positive coefficient of inflation is insignificant, but points in the expected direction. The 10-year government
bond rate is negative and insignificant when bank controls are included. The coefficients of banklevel controls are in line with the previous literature. As in Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016), the
systemic risk contributions increase in the size of an institution as well as in leverage, but decrease
in an institution’s maturity mismatch.24 Only the coefficient of loan growth is insignificant.

4.2

The role of bank and bubble characteristics
The results presented above provide first evidence of higher systemic risk during bubble

episodes and underline the importance of bank-level characteristics for banks’ systemic risk contributions. We go one step further and ask what is the role of bank and bubble characteristics for the
relationship between asset price bubbles and systemic risk.
Columns 1 to 4 of Table 5 report regression results including one bank-level variable at a
time and the respective interactions with the bubble indicators. In Column 5, all four bank-level
variables and their interactions with the bubble indicators are included jointly. In columns 6 and
7, we add the two bubble characteristics, leading to our baseline regression in Equation (3).

[Table 5 about here]

The inclusion of interaction terms leaves the coefficients of the bubble indicators qualitatively
unchanged. However, it alters their interpretation as they now refer to a bank with median bank
(and bubble) characteristics. The interpretation of the coefficients of bank characteristics changes
as well. They now refer to normal times, i. e., outside of bubble episodes.
24

Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016) define the maturity mismatch inversely to our definition such that the different
sign of the corresponding coefficient in our paper is in line with the respective finding in that paper.

19

The estimated coefficients of bank characteristics during non-bubble times are similar to those
in previous regressions. While larger bank size and leverage go along with higher systemic risk,
maturity mismatch is associated with lower systemic risk, regardless of whether we include only
one of the bank characteristics (columns 1 to 4) or all four at the same time (column 5). Loan
growth is highly significant with a negative sign, implying that higher loan growth goes along with
lower systemic risk in normal times. This finding, which proves to be very robust throughout the
analysis, is suggestive of healthy loan growth outside of bubble periods.
Interestingly, the relationship between bank characteristics and systemic risk contributions
changes markedly during bubble episodes. For example, size is associated with larger increases in
systemic risk contributions during real estate and stock market busts and, to a lesser extent, also
during stock market booms (column 5). Hence, large banks’ contributions to systemic risk appear
to be particularly large during asset price bubbles, as would have been expected due to their greater
power to spread risks throughout the financial system. Loan growth is less benign in bubble episodes
than in normal times. While the relationship between loan growth and systemic risk is negative in
normal times, this relationship vanishes during bubble episodes. During real estate busts, systemic
risk contributions even increase in lending growth, as the sum of the coefficients of loan growth
and its interaction with the bust indicators becomes positive and statistically significant (column 5,
test not reported). This stresses the dangers for financial stability of high lending growth during
bubble episodes when rising prices induce unhealthy lending, the risks of which materialize in the
bust. Similarly, the regressions show a significantly less negative relationship between maturity
mismatch and systemic risk during all types of bubble episodes when all bank characteristics are
included (column 5). Hence, higher maturity mismatch appears more problematic during bubble
episodes. The results on leverage are more mixed as its interaction has a significantly positive
coefficient only during real estate booms, while it is not statistically significant during real estate
busts and significantly negative during stock market bubbles (column 5). Overall, these regressions
strongly support the relevance of banks’ balance sheet characteristics for the relationship between
asset price bubbles and systemic risk.
When adding bubble length and bubble size to our analysis (columns 6 and 7), these results
regarding bank characteristics during and outside of bubble episodes remain almost identical. For

20

bubble characteristics, we find that during stock market booms the coefficients of length and size
are positive and significant. This is plausible as longer booms are likely to lead to a larger build-up
of imbalances in the financial system and larger booms have the potential for a more pronounced
bust after the burst. Since length and size are highly correlated during the emergence of stock
market bubbles (0.97), it is impossible to distinguish their effects empirically. The coefficients of
size and length are insignificant during real estate booms. The increase in systemic risk during
these episodes appears to depend more on bank than on bubble characteristics. During both real
estate and stock market busts, the coefficients of the two bubble characteristics are negative and,
with the exception of bubble size during stock market busts, statistically significant. This could be
explained by a fading out of the initial shock of the burst and policy interventions alleviating the
consequences of the burst at later stages of the bust.

4.3

Economic significance
We now analyze the economic significance of the observed increase in systemic risk during

bubble episodes and discuss the quantitative importance of bank and bubble characteristics. During
a stock market boom or bust with median bubble characteristics, ∆CoVaR increases by around
0.37 percentage points relative to normal times for a bank of median size, loan growth, leverage,
and maturity mismatch (average of columns 6 and 7 in Table 5). This corresponds to 22 percent
(=0.37/1.68) of the median level of ∆CoVaR. The corresponding increases associated with the
boom and bust of real estate bubbles amount to 6 and 15 percent, respectively.
From a financial stability perspective, we are more concerned about extreme events, i. e.,
about a bank like Lehman Brothers during the US subprime housing bubble rather than some average bank during a median bubble. To account for this heterogeneity, we quantify the dependence
of the systemic risk increase on bank and bubble characteristics. The boxplots in Figure 5 illustrate
the distribution of the increase in systemic risk relative to the median of ∆CoVaR. Specifically,
it depicts the median increase (white horizontal line in each box), the 75th and 25th percentile
(upper and lower end of each box), and the 95th and 5th percentile of the increase in systemic
risk (whiskers) in dependence of bank and bubble characteristics. Note that there is no reason to
expect the largest bank to also exhibit the largest loan growth, leverage, and maturity mismatch,

21

such that the range depending on all bank characteristics is smaller than the sum of the ranges of
individual bank characteristics. Moreover, as bubble length and size are highly correlated, their
effects do not add up. Since we cannot simultaneously include bubble length and size due to the
high correlation of both variables, the figure is based on the average of the estimated coefficients
in our two baseline regressions (Table 5, columns 6 and 7).
The boxplots yield some interesting insights. It is striking that, with the exception of stock
market booms, the increase in systemic risk depends much more on bank than on bubble characteristics. This corresponds well to the narrative of the rather small shock from the US subprime
housing bubble that was amplified due to imbalances in the financial sector. Comparing boom and
bust phases, the bust phases exhibit a larger median increase in systemic risk, but also a larger
range of the increase. Hence, an emerging asset price bubble goes along with increased financial
fragility, yet it is only during the bust phase that the full risk associated with the bubble materializes. During real estate busts, the 95th percentile of the increase in systemic risk in dependence of
balance sheet characteristics amounts to 55 percent of the median of ∆CoVaR, the 99th percentile
to almost 70 percent. For stock market busts, the corresponding increases are 46 and 56 percent,
respectively.
The most important factor driving the heterogeneity of effects during bubble episodes is bank
size, especially during bust phases. This is plausible as a large bank under distress due to the burst
of an asset price bubble has a much higher potential to transmit this distress to the rest of the
financial system. The systemic risk contribution of a bank with bank size at the 95th percentile of
the size distribution increases by approximately 70 percent of the median of ∆CoVaR during real
estate busts and by almost 60 percent during stock market busts.
To put these estimates further into perspective, we predict ∆CoVaR for Lehman Brothers
once with the actual values of all variables and once assuming no bubble had been present. According to our estimation, at the time of the burst of the US subprime housing bubble, the systemic
risk posed by Lehman Brothers would have been 40 percent lower if the bubble had not existed.
These results do not support the view that real estate bubbles are generally more harmful
than their stock market counterparts. Instead, the ordering depends on bank characteristics. While,

22

for example, stock market busts appear to be more harmful than real estate busts at median
bank characteristics, the latter are more harmful at sufficiently unfavorable bank characteristics.
Moreover, our results support the view that developments within the financial sector are more
relevant than a bubble’s asset class, as has already been argued by Brunnermeier and Schnabel
(2016).

Results for alternative measures
Our baseline results are based on regressions using one identification procedure for asset price

bubbles and one specific measure of systemic risk. While the measures we rely on are widely used,
others constitute reasonable alternatives. Therefore, we repeat our regressions using alternative
measures of asset price bubbles and systemic risk.

5.1

Results using alternative bubble measures
We first repeat our main analyses using the alternative bubble measures, applying the BSADF

approach to price-to-rent and price-to-dividend data, or the trend-deviation approach (see Section 3.2). Table 6 restates our two baseline regressions alongside estimates obtained from an
identical specification, but using the alternative bubble measures.
Compared to the baseline results (columns 1 and 2), the regressions using bubbles identified
through the BSADF test applied to normalized price data (columns 3 and 4) confirm most of our
previous findings, with slightly lower significance levels. Again, all bubble episodes are associated
with increased systemic risk at median bank and bubble characteristics. Moreover, systemic risk
contributions increase in bank size, decrease in maturity mismatch, and do not significantly differ in
leverage during normal times. The coefficients of loan growth remain negative but turn insignificant.
During bubble episodes, we once more see that the increase in systemic risk during real estate busts
and stock market booms and busts is more pronounced for larger banks. Only during real estate
boom phases, it is still less pronounced, but it now turns significant. The relationship between
loan growth and systemic risk during bubble episodes remains positive but becomes less significant

23

during real estate bubbles and more significant during stock market booms. In economic terms,
however, the relationship remains small (see Figure C3). The results on leverage remain mixed.
For maturity mismatch, there is no significantly different relationship during real estate bubbles
anymore, while results on stock market bubbles are unchanged.
The results on bubble characteristics are again similar. Some bubble characteristics lose
significance, suggesting a higher relevance of bank characteristics. Only the coefficient on the size
of real estate busts changes its sign, a finding that only appears in this particular specification.
As before, bust phases of the bubble exhibit a higher level and a higher range of the systemic risk
increase compared to the boom phases. Bank size remains the most relevant driver of the increase
in systemic risk contributions (see Figure C3).
The results based on bubbles estimated with the trend-deviation approach are very similar
to those using the normalized price series, with one important exception. The increase in systemic
risk during real estate bubbles is much smaller. At median bank and bubble characteristics, real
estate bubbles are not associated with increased systemic risk. This could be driven by the much
smaller number of observations for real estate bubbles (see Figure C2). In fact, standard errors are
now much larger, while coefficients are not that much smaller. Moreover, as argued before, extreme
cases are more relevant than average bubble episodes. In case of unfavorable bubble characteristics,
the results again show a significant increase in ∆CoVaR by 53 percent of its median (see Figure C4).

[Table 6 about here]

Hence, despite some quantitative differences, the regressions with the alternative bubble
measures support the finding that systemic risk increases during asset price bubbles, especially
for unfavorable bank characteristics. As before, bank size stands out, while the results on bubble
characteristics are slightly weaker than before, at least for real estate bubbles.

5.2

Results using MES as an alternative systemic risk measure
To assess whether the results depend on the choice of systemic risk measure, we repeat our

baseline regressions using MES instead of ∆CoVaR. In the interpretation, one has to keep in mind

24

the conceptual differences between the two measures. MES quantifies the average return loss of a
financial institution during the 5 percent days with the worst financial system returns during the
past year. Hence, a higher MES signals a larger systemic risk exposure of a bank. In contrast,
a higher ∆CoVaR stands for a larger systemic risk contribution of a bank. Based on the similar
evolution of ∆CoVaR and MES in the aggregate (see Figure 4), we expect MES to also increase
during bubble episodes. In contrast, due to the conceptual differences, there is no reason to expect
the same relationships with bank characteristics. In fact, ∆CoVaR has been shown to react more
to the size of banks, while other measures are driven more by leverage (see, e. g., Benoit, Colletaz,
Hurlin, and Pérignon, 2013).
Table 7 displays the results from re-running our baseline regressions with MES instead of
∆CoVaR as dependent variable. As in our baseline regressions, systemic risk increases during
stock market bubbles at median bank and bubble characteristics. For real estate bubbles, the
increase in systemic risk is significant only for the bust phase and only when lagged data series are
used, but then with a very large coefficient.
The coefficients on bank characteristics in normal times are also similar to before.

As

∆CoVaR, MES increases in bank size and decreases in loan growth and maturity mismatch outside
of bubble episodes. Leverage now has a significantly negative effect in columns 1 and 2 suggesting
a higher systemic risk exposure for better capitalized banks. This may reflect the fact that better
capitalized banks can afford to be riskier and therefore take higher asset risk.
Again, the relationship between asset price bubbles and systemic risk depends on bank characteristics but in different ways than before. Large banks now show a smaller systemic risk exposure
during real estate booms. This is plausible as large banks are often less active in mortgage lending
than smaller banks. In contrast, large banks are highly exposed during stock market busts, which
is consistent with a higher share of market-based activities. Hence, while large banks are typically greater risk spreaders during bubble episodes, their exposure to systemic risk may actually
be smaller in some cases.
Unlike for ∆CoVaR, the relationship between loan growth and MES during asset price bubbles is not statistically different from normal times. Hence, loan growth during asset price bubbles

25

appears to increase banks’ potential to contribute risk to the financial system but not their exposure
to systemic risk. The results on leverage point more strongly in a risk-increasing direction. Higher
leverage is associated with a higher risk exposure especially during real estate booms, suggesting
that poorly capitalized banks become highly vulnerable in such periods. Somewhat surprisingly,
the sign reverses during stock market busts. The findings regarding the interactions between maturity mismatch and the bubble indicators show another noteworthy difference. The corresponding
interactions with real estate booms and busts are still significantly positive or insignificant. The
interactions with stock market booms and busts, however, are now negative and significant. This
could reflect the fact that banks with a stronger focus on the traditional banking business involving
higher maturity transformation are less susceptible to market risk especially during stock market
bubbles. If the overall effect of maturity mismatch during bubble episodes is considered (i. e., the
sum of the single and the interaction term), the relationship between the maturity mismatch and
systemic risk is negative or insignificant for both MES and ∆CoVaR.
Looking at bubble characteristics, the results are very similar to before. During a stock
market boom, MES increases in bubble size and length, pointing towards the potential for a more
pronounced bust. MES decreases in bubble size and length during the bust phase of stock market
and real estate bubbles. Hence, we again see a fading impact of the burst, potentially due to policy
measures alleviating financial sector distress.
Considering economic significance, the results are very similar (see Figure C5). As before,
the boxplots corresponding to the regression results show a larger dependence of the increase in
systemic risk on bank than on bubble characteristics . For MES, this ordering also applies during
stock market booms. Bust phases exhibit larger increases in systemic risk. And bank size is a
dominant factor driving the heterogeneity of effects. Hence, while the specific interpretation of the
interaction terms differs due to the different interpretations of the two measures, the main finding
regarding the important role of bank characteristics is highly robust.

Further robustness checks
In this section, we assess the robustness of our baseline results in several directions. First, we

account for ∆CoVaR’s variation coming from developments at macro level by considering additional
control variables, additional fixed effects, and an alternative estimation strategy for ∆CoVaR.
Second, we analyze the sensitivity of results with respect to banks’ size by considering sample
splits and, alternatively, by weighting observations by bank size. Third, we evaluate whether the
results are driven by particular episodes such as the global financial crisis, which stands out due to
its spike in systemic risk.

6.1

Controlling for additional variation at macro level
In this subsection we check whether the results in the regressions using ∆CoVaR depend on

the specific properties of this measure, in particular the inclusion of macroeconomic variables in the
estimation. The motivation for these additional analyses becomes apparent when writing ∆CoVaR
as

i
∆CoV aRq,t
= σqi + ωqi Mt−1 ,

system|i

where σqi = β̂q

system|i

i ) and ω i = β̂
(α̂qi − α̂50
q
q

(4)

i ).25 While the cross-sectional variation
(γ̂qi − γ̂50

in ∆CoVaR is driven by bank-specific factors, its time series variation is driven by the system
variables Mt−1 (see Equation (4)). These variables vary over time at the financial system level (see
Appendix B). While none of these variables are directly related to real estate price dynamics, the
variables include stock market returns and volatility. This may not be a concern during stock market
booms, as ∆CoVaR relies on conditional correlations in the left tail of the return distributions of
the financial system and individual banks. It may, however, raise concerns regarding our estimates
on stock market busts. In this robustness check, we therefore want to exclude that the results are
driven by a mechanical correlation due to stock market returns and volatilities being included in
both the systemic risk estimation and the bubble estimation.
25

The expression can be derived by substituting Equation (B3) in Equation (B6) (see Appendix B).

27

Columns 1 and 2 of Table 8 restate our baseline results from Table 5 (columns 6 and 7). In
columns 3 and 4 of this table, we add the stock market return and volatility included in Mt−1 as
additional controls to absorb the corresponding variation (coefficients of controls not displayed).
The coefficients of the real estate bubble indicators prove to be fully robust. However, the coefficient
of the stock market boom indicator becomes smaller, and the one on stock market busts even
insignificant. Hence, it cannot be ruled out that the estimated increase in systemic risk during
stock market bubbles is partly driven by the involvement of the stock market return and volatility
during the estimation of the systemic risk measure. At the same time, the coefficients of all
bank characteristics and their interactions with the bubble indicators are remarkably robust. The
coefficients of the variables capturing bubble characteristics are also similar but become smaller
in absolute terms. This further supports the larger relevance of bank characteristics compared to
bubble characteristics for the increase in systemic risk. As before, real estate busts go along with
a larger increase in systemic risk than stock market busts for unfavorable bank characteristics. In
this robustness check, this ordering also applies for the bust phases at median bank characteristics.
Next, we add country-time fixed effects to our baseline regression instead of the stock-price
related financial system variables. In this specification (column 5 of Table 8), the bubble indicators,
bubble characteristics, and macroeconomic control variables drop out as they vary only at countrytime level. However, we can assess the robustness of our results regarding the bank-level variables
as well as their interactions with the bubble indicators. The statistical significance of the estimated
coefficients is reduced due to the reduction in the degrees of freedom. At the same time, the
basic results are again maintained remarkably well, which provides strong support for our previous
findings.

[Table 8 about here]

We perform an additional robustness check to address ∆CoVaR’s dependence on the financial
system variables Mt−1 by modifying ∆CoVaR’s estimation procedure. So far, ∆CoVaR relied
on estimates of financial institutions’ VaR (see Equation (B3)). This estimated VaR introduces
∆CoVaR’s dependence on financial system variables (see Equation (4)). As an alternative, we now

28

calculate financial institutions’ VaR directly from their past equity returns using one-year rolling
windows. The windows are overlapping, as they move forward on a monthly basis. All other
estimation details remain unchanged. The rolling ∆CoVaR can be expressed as

i
i
i
∆CoV aRq,t
= β̂qsystem|i (V aRq,t
− V aR50,t
),

(5)

where we drop the hats of the VaR as it is now calculated as opposed to estimated. The time
variation in both the calculated VaR and the rolling ∆CoVaR is independent of the financial system
variables Mt−1 . These variables are now exclusively used to control for general risk factors when
estimating the dependence between bank returns and financial system returns (see Equation (B4)).
While the mean and the median of this rolling version of ∆CoVaR are slightly lower (1.59
and 1.23 vs. 1.96 and 1.68), the standard deviation is slightly higher (1.77 vs. 1.65). The evolution
of the average rolling ∆CoVaR in all four financial systems is similar to its original counterpart.
As before, there is a pronounced peak at the time of the global financial crisis. The euro area crisis
and the Japanese banking crisis at the beginning of the 1990s show spikes, while the dotcom bubble
is hardly recognizable in the US series (see Figure C6).
We re-estimate our baseline regression with the rolling ∆CoVaR as dependent variable. As
shown in columns 6 and 7 of Table 8, there is a significant increase in systemic risk in all bubble
episodes, as in our baseline regressions. The magnitudes are higher for real estate bubbles and
slightly lower for stock market bubbles. While some of the further variables experience changes in
their significance levels, the overall results are again robust.
We also run regressions with time fixed effects to account for global factors (Table C11,
columns 3 and 4). As expected, the increase in systemic risk during bust episodes turns insignificant
at the median level of bank and bubble characteristics, as the bust phases are generally shorter and
often show up simultaneously to bust phases in other countries such that the remaining variation is
highly limited (see Figure 3). All other main results, particulary the significant increase in systemic
risk for unfavorable bank characteristics, are confirmed. This also applies when we consider the full
bubble episodes without distinguishing between boom and bust phases (see Table C3, column 2).

6.2

Large and small banks
In a next step, we analyze whether the results differ between large and small banks. This

distinction serves three purposes. First, as mentioned in Section 3, the dataset is dominated by
relatively small banks, which are mostly located in the US (see Table C2). Small US banks are
much more frequently listed than, e. g., small European banks. Therefore, this robustness check can
also rule out that our results are driven by small US banks. Second, in the baseline regressions, we
assume that a bank is affected only by a bubble in its home country. For large and internationally
active banks, this assumption may be rather strong. A focus on small, locally active banks allows
us to address this potential concern because for them the assumption is more appropriate. Third,
small and large banks display different business models and dynamics, which might not be fully
captured by bank fixed effects and the bank size variable.
For the analyses, we first split the sample into large and small banks. In order to avoid banks
switching groups over time, the split is based on a bank’s mean size over the sample period. Banks
with a mean size below (above) 30 billion USD are considered as small (large). The results are
robust to the choice of the cut-off value. While the dominance of US banks is mitigated substantially
in the sample of large banks, the same is not true for the sample of small banks. Therefore, we
drop the smallest US banks (again based on mean bank size) such that the number of observations
from the US is no larger than that of the country with the second largest number of observations on
small banks (France). In these regressions, we use the logarithm of ∆CoVaR as dependent variable
in order to make the size of the estimated coefficients comparable across bank groups.
Columns 1 and 2 of Table 9 display the results for large banks, columns 3 and 4 those for
small banks. We find that the results for both bank groups are very similar to each other and
to our baseline estimates. There is, however, one interesting exception. The increase in systemic
risk during real estate booms is statistically significant only for the group of small banks. This
may be due to mortgage lending being a core activity of small banks while large banks’ business
models are more diversified. While some of the other coefficients lose significance, which may be
due to the strongly reduced sample size, the results for both bank groups are very similar to our
baseline regression. We can thus exclude that our results are driven by small banks or by the large

30

number of US observations. Moreover, our previous results do not appear to be driven by asset
price bubbles emerging outside of their home country, as they equally apply to small banks, which
are only locally active.
As a further robustness check, we re-run our baseline regressions including the full sample of
banks, weighting each bank’s observations with their mean bank size relative to the size of their
financial system. Thereby, we simultaneously limit the relevance of observations of small banks
and eliminate the US bias in our sample. The results are reported in columns 5 and 6 of Table 9.
While the increase in systemic risk during real estate booms again turns insignificant at median
bank and bubble characteristics (similar to columns 1 and 2), the general results are once more
well in line with our previous findings. Overall, our results do not seem to be driven by banks of
particular size.

[Table 9 about here]

6.3

Choice of sample period
We then re-estimate our baseline regressions for different sample periods to exclude that the

results are driven by particular bubble episodes. First, we run the regressions excluding observations
before 1995, as the number of banks is relatively small in the beginning of our sample, which may
make this period less representative. As shown in Table 10, the results are highly robust to the
exclusion of the initial period of our sample (columns 3 and 4). While the relationship between
systemic risk and real estate booms turns insignificant at median bank and bubble characteristics,
the signs and significance levels of all other coefficients are almost always identical to the baseline
regression shown in columns 1 and 2.
Second, one may worry that the results are unduly affected by the global financial crisis.
Moreover, real estate bubbles are more frequent during the second half of our sample. One might
be concerned about a structural break leading to both the occurrence of real estate bubbles and
increased systemic risk. A visual inspection of Figure 4, which displays the development of ∆CoVaR
over time, does not reveal a general increase in systemic risk when abstracting from the financial

31

crisis. Excluding the global financial crisis yields an even stronger relationship between systemic
risk and real estate busts (Table 10, columns 5 and 6). The remaining results are again highly
robust. Consequently, none of our results appears to be driven by particular bubble episodes.

[Table 10 about here]

6.4

Business cycles
In a final robustness check, we attempt to better account for business cycles. In our regres-

sions, we take account of the development of the real economy by controlling for GDP growth.
However, this variable may not fully capture business cycles. While parts of the recent literature have argued that business cycles and financial cycles have become less connected in recent
years (e. g., Drehmann, Borio, and Tsatsaronis, 2012), this may not be true for our entire sample.
Therefore, we use data on turning points of business cycles provided by the OECD to construct an
indicator variable that equals one during the boom phase of the business cycle, and zero otherwise.
We plot business cycles alongside bubble boom and bust episodes. The visual inspection
reveals no significant synchronization between business and financial cycles (see Figure C7). In
fact, business cycle booms exhibit a small negative correlation with stock market and real estate
booms in our sample (see Table C12, columns 1 and 3). As an additional check, we re-estimate our
baseline regressions including the business cycle boom indicator. Only few coefficients change their
significance levels, and all main results continue to hold, which confirms our previous findings (see
Table 11).

Conclusion
Employing a broad sample of banks in 17 OECD countries over the period 1987 to 2015, this

paper empirically analyzes the relationship between asset price bubbles and systemic risk. While
most of the previous empirical literature has approached this question at macroeconomic level, we

32

provide evidence on the relationship between asset price bubbles and systemic risk at the level of
individual financial institutions. This allows us to assess the allocation of risks across banks, which
is crucial for detecting the sources of financial fragility.
Our results show that asset price bubbles are indeed associated with increased systemic risk
at bank level. This relationship is not limited to the turmoil following the burst of a bubble, but
it exists already during its emergence. We find that the increase in systemic risk depends strongly
on bank characteristics. Higher loan growth, a stronger maturity mismatch, and especially larger
bank size tend to make financial institutions, and hence the financial system, vulnerable to asset
price bubbles. The size and length of asset price booms and busts matter as well, albeit to a lesser
extent. The increase in systemic risk is largest during real estate busts, especially for unfavorable
balance sheet characteristics: The 95th percentile of the increase in systemic risk in dependence of
balance sheet characteristics is equal to 55 percent of the median of ∆CoVaR, the 99th percentile
to almost 70 percent.
To put the economic significance of the increase in systemic risk further into perspective, a
back of the envelope calculation for the time of the burst of the US subprime housing bubble shows
that the systemic risk posed by the distress of Lehman Brothers would have been 40 percent lower
if the bubble had not existed. Overall, the highest increases in systemic risk are found in real estate
busts for banks with unfavorable balance sheet characteristics.
The main results are robust across different bubble and systemic risk measures. While real
estate bubbles appear less problematic at median bank and bubble characteristics when using a
trend-deviation approach, all types of bubbles show sharp increases in systemic risk for unfavorable
balance sheet characteristics. When using MES instead of ∆CoVaR as a measure of systemic risk,
the specific relationship with bank characteristics changes in line with the conceptual differences
between the two measures. But as with ∆CoVaR, busts show larger increases in systemic risk than
booms, and the increases are strongly related to banks’ characteristics, especially bank size. When
accounting for the systemic risk measures’ dependence on aggregate equity market returns and
volatilities, the increase in systemic risk during stock market busts becomes smaller. Our results
are not driven by particular episodes, such as the US subprime housing bubble and the following

33

global financial crisis, or by business cycle effects. Neither are they specific to certain countries
or a particular group of banks. Hence, the results appear to be robust across a broad range of
robustness checks.
While we do not explicitly analyze the role of financial regulation, a number of results deserve
particular attention. First, and most importantly, an important part of the vulnerability from asset
price bubbles stems from differences across banks. The relationship between bank size and increases
in systemic risk during bubble episodes is particularly strong. Second, systemic risk rises already
in the boom phase. Bubble size and length play a noticeable role in the build-up of systemic risk,
especially in stock market booms, such that a more harmful collapse can be expected after larger
and longer-lasting bubbles. Finally, stock market bubbles cannot entirely be dismissed as a source
of financial instability because their fallout may be substantial as well, especially for weak bank
characteristics.

The figure illustrates the increase in systemic risk during bubble episodes in dependence of bank and
bubble characteristics. “Unfavorable characteristics” refers to the 95th percentile of this increase based
on the distribution of bank or bubble characteristics as indicated in the legend. The pattern is robust to
the choice of the percentile. The figure relies on regression results provided and discussed in Section 4.

Figure 2: Construction of the bubble indicators
The BSADF approach identifies the beginning of a bubble episode as the point in time at which the
sequence of BSADF test statistics (blue dotted line) first exceeds its critical value (red dotted line) and
thus signals the price data (black line) being on an explosive trajectory. The end of a bubble episode is
reached once the test statistics fall back below their critical values. Additionally, we distinguish between
the boom and the bust phase of a bubble (the blue and grey shaded areas) based on the peak of the
price series during each bubble episode. Using this approach, we construct four binary variables for
each country, indicating episodes in which a real estate or stock market bubble emerges or collapses.
The figure illustrates the construction of these indicators based on the recent Spanish housing bubble.
Details on the BSADF approach are provided in Section 3.2 and Appendix A.

Figure 5: Systemic risk during bubble episodes in dependence of bank and bubble characteristics
The figure illustrates the distribution of the increase in systemic risk during bubble episodes in percent
of the median of ∆CoVaR. The white horizontal line within each box refers to the increase at the median
of all characteristics. The upper and lower end of the boxes refer to the increase at the 75th and 25th
percentile of the distribution of the indicated bank or bubble characteristics. The upper and lower end of
the lines refer to the 95th and 5th percentile. All results rely on the average of the estimated coefficients
in our two baseline regressions (Table 5, columns (6) and (7)). The largest bank does not simultaneously
exhibit the largest loan growth, leverage, and maturity mismatch, such that the range depending on all
bank characteristics is smaller than the sum of the ranges of individual bank characteristics.

Table 1: Number of bubble episodes per country
The estimation approaches are described in Sections 3.2 and Appendix A. The statistics are computed for
the dataset used in the baseline regression. Figures 3, C1, and C2 provide an overview of bubble episodes
estimated per country. Differences in the number of booms and busts of bubble episodes are due to bubbles
that take place only partly during the sample period. We can estimate these bubble episodes since the
data used for bubble identification covers a significantly longer time period than the data used in the main
analyses.

Table 2: Descriptive statistics on bubble characteristics during bubble episodes
The statistics are computed for the dataset used in the baseline regression and conditional on the corresponding bubble indicator being equal to one. For example, within stock market boom periods, a stock
market boom has on average been present for 29 months and features a 79% price increase relative to the
pre-bubble level according to estimates building on the BSADF approach. Variable definitions are provided
in Table C1. The estimation approaches are described in Sections 3.2 and Appendix A.

Table 7: The role of bank and bubble characteristics: alternative systemic risk measure
Bubble estimates are based on the BSADF approach. Macro controls are a banking crisis dummy, GDP growth, interest rates,
inflation, and investment-to-GDP growth. Columns 3 and 4 report regressions with all explanatory variables lagged by an
additional 6 months. Variable definitions are provided in Table C1. Standard errors are clustered at the bank and time levels.
***, **, * indicate significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels. P-values are in parentheses.

Table 8: Controlling for additional variation at the macro level
Bubble estimates are based on the BSADF approach. Macro controls are a banking crisis dummy, GDP growth, interest rates,
inflation, and investment-to-GDP growth. Columns 1 and 2 restate our baseline regressions from Table 5, columns 6 and 7. The
additional macroeconomic variables in columns 3 and 4 are the stock price returns and volatilities used during the estimation
of ∆CoVaR (see Appendix B). Column 5 estimates our baseline regression with country-time fixed effects. The estimation
strategy of the rolling ∆CoVaR is described in Section 6.1. Variable definitions are provided in Table C1. Standard errors are
clustered at the bank and time levels. ***, **, * indicate significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels. P-values are in parentheses.

Table 9: Large and small banks
Bubble estimates are based on the BSADF approach. Columns 1 to 4 provide estimates of our baseline regressions for small
and large banks separately. We eliminate the US bias in the sample of small banks by excluding the smallest US banks. See
Table C2 for an overview of the number of banks and observations per country. Columns 5 and 6 provide estimates from
regressions with each bank’s observations weighted by their mean bank size relative to the size of their financial system (North
America, Europe, Japan, or Australia). Variable definitions are provided in Table C1. Standard errors are clustered at the
bank and time levels. ***, **, * indicate significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels. P-values are in parentheses.

Estimation of bubble episodes

The BSADF approach applies sequences of ADF tests to systematically changing fractions of
a sample to identify episodes of explosive processes in price data. We follow the estimation strategy
proposed by Phillips, Shi, and Yu (2015a). To fix notation, let r1 denote some starting fraction
of the sample and r2 some ending fraction, implying r1 < r2 . The fraction of the corresponding
subsample is given by rw = r2 −r1 . Furthermore, let r0 denote the fractional threshold that ensures
that any analyzed subsample is large enough for the test to be efficient. The threshold is chosen
√
according to r0 = 0.01 + 1.8 T , where T refers to the number of observations in the sample.
The BSADF statistic (as opposed to the approach) for sample fraction r2 is given by the
supremum of all values of the test statistics of ADF tests performed while holding the ending
fraction of the sample fixed at r2 and varying the starting fraction from 0 to r2 − r0 . Figure A1
illustrates the idea. Formally, the BSADF statistic is thus given by

BSADFr2 (r0 ) =

sup
r1 ∈[0,r2 −r0 ]

{BADFrr12 } .

(A1)

Figure A1: Recursive nature of the BSADF test

Source: Phillips, Shi, and Yu (2015a, p. 1052)

The identification of bubble episodes relies on a sequence of BSADF statistics resulting from
varying ending fraction r2 . Let the fraction of the sample at which the bubble starts be denoted
by re , the fraction of the sample at which it ends by rf , and the estimators of both by r̂e and r̂f ,
respectively. The starting fraction re is estimated by the earliest point in time for which the BSADF
test rejects the null hypothesis of no bubble existing. Similarly, the estimator for ending fraction rf

A1

is given by the earliest point in time after the emergence of the bubble and some minimum bubble
length δlog(T ) for which the BSADF test does not reject the null. Formally,

r̂e =
and r̂f =

inf [r2 : BSADFr2 (r0 ) > scvrβ2 ]

r2 ∈[r0 ,1]

inf

r2 ∈[r̂e +δlog(T ),1]

[r2 : BSADFr2 (r0 ) < scvrβ2 ] ,

(A2)
(A3)

where T is the number of observations of the analyzed time series and scvrβ2 is the critical value of
the BSADF statistic based on bT r2 c observations and confidence level β. bT r2 c refers to the largest
integer smaller than or equal to T r2 . Critical values are obtained by Monte Carlo simulations based
on 2,000 repetitions. The parameter δ is to be chosen freely according to one’s beliefs about what
minimum duration should be required in order to call surging prices a bubble. The minimum length
requirement excludes short blips from being identified as bubbles and prevents estimating an overly
early termination date of bubbles taking off slowly. We choose δ such that the minimum length
of bubbles equals 6 months. The test identifies a few instances of bust-boom cycles that might
be interpreted as “negative bubbles.” Unfortunately, their number is too low to be included as a
separate category in the main analyses. As the dynamics during such bust-boom cycles are likely
to be quite different from those during customary bubble episodes, we disregard these bust-boom
episodes when constructing the bubble indicators.

Appendix B

Estimation of ∆CoVaR

We obtain daily information on the number of outstanding shares, unpadded unadjusted
prices of common equity in national currency, and the corresponding market capitalization in US
Dollar from Thomson Reuters Datastream. To exclude public offerings, repurchases of shares and
similar activities from biasing the results, observations for which the number of outstanding shares
changed compared to the previous day are dropped. The daily observations are then collapsed to
weekly frequency.

A2

We calculate the weekly return losses on equity (X) of institution i and those of the financial
system:
i Ni
i i
Pt+1
t+1 − Pt Nt

(B1)
(B2)

where Pti is the price of common equity of institution i at time t in national currency, N refers to the
number of outstanding shares and M V is the market value in US Dollar. We use national currencies
to compute the return losses in Equation (B1) to prevent exchange rate fluctuations from biasing
our results.26 When calculating market shares of each institution (the ratio in Equation (B2)),
we have to rely on a uniform currency, which is why we use the market values in US dollar there.
While exchange rate fluctuations introduce noise into the calculation of system return losses, they
do not bias the results.
The return losses are merged with variables capturing general risk factors. Adrian and
Brunnermeier (2016) use the following state variables:

• the change in the three-month yield calculated from the three-month T-Bill rate published
with the Federal Reserve Board’s H.15 release;
• the change in the slope of the yield curve as captured by the yield spread between the ten-year
treasury rate (FRB H.15) and the three-month T-Bill rate;
• the TED spread, measured as the difference between the three-month Libor rate (FRED
database) and the three-month secondary market bill rate (FRB H.15);
• the change in the credit spread between the bonds obtaining a Baa rating from Moody’s
(FRB H.15) and the ten-year treasury rate;
• the weekly market returns of the S&P 500;
26
To clarify the relevance of the currency, suppose return losses of Eurozone banks were calculated in US dollar.
Further suppose, the euro would depreciate vis-à-vis the US dollar. Then, all other things equal, all banks in the
Eurozone would simultaneously experience return losses which would lead to increases in ∆CoVaR.

A3

• the equity volatility calculated as a 22-day rolling window standard deviation of the daily
CRSP equity market return;
• the difference between the weekly real estate sector return (companies with a SIC code between 65 and 66) and the weekly financial system return (all financial companies in the
sample).

As usual for the estimation of ∆CoVaR outside the US, we do not include the spread between the
real estate sector return and the financial system return.27 Since we estimate ∆CoVaR in a multicountry setting, we assign each financial institution to one of the following four financial systems:
North America, Europe, Japan or Australia. The association with a system is based on the location
of an institution’s headquarter. We use a distinct set of state variables for each system. Table B1
provides an overview of the data used to construct the system-specific control variables.
The estimation procedure starts by estimating the VaR and the relationship between institutionspecific losses and system losses as
i

i
V[
aRq,t = X̂q,t
= α̂qi + γ̂qi Mt−1 ,

(B3)

system|i

(B4)

X̂q,t

= α̂qsystem|i + γ̂qsystem|i Mt−1 + β̂qsystem|i Xti .

Mt−1 is a vector of the macroeconomic control variables. We apply a stress level of q = 98% in
all regressions. The conditional value at risk is calculated by combining estimates from the two
previous regressions:
i

i
CoV aRq,t
= α̂qsystem|i + γ̂qsystem|i Mt−1 + β̂qsystem|i V[
aRq,t .

(B5)

Following the definition provided in Equation (1), the time series of ∆CoVaR is calculated as
i

i

i
∆CoV aRq,t
= β̂qsystem|i (V[
aRq,t − V[
aR50,t ) .

27

See, e. g., López-Espinosa, Moreno, Rubia, and Valderrama (2012); Barth and Schnabel (2013).

(B6)

We estimate ∆CoVaR at weekly frequency. To merge them with all other variables included
in our main analyses, we collapse the resulting estimates to monthly frequency by taking averages.
Table B1: System-specific data
The 10-year government bond rates for Germany, Japan and Australia are only available at monthly frequency. In these instances, we use cubic spline interpolations to obtain the weekly observations required for
the quantile regressions.

based on quarterly data to test the robustness of the results with regard to the interpolation of data. Bubble estimates are based
on the BSADF approach. Macro controls are a banking crisis dummy, GDP growth, interest rates, inflation, and investmentto-GDP growth. Variable definitions are provided in Table C1. Standard errors are clustered at the bank and time levels. ***,
**, * indicate significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels. P-values are in parentheses.

Table C7: The role of bank and bubble characteristics: more pronounced lead-lag structures
Columns 1 and 2 restate our baseline regressions from Table 5, columns 6 and 7. Bubble estimates are based on the BSADF
approach. Macro controls are a banking crisis dummy, GDP growth, interest rates, inflation, and investment-to-GDP growth.
Variable definitions are provided in Table C1. Standard errors are clustered at the bank and time levels. ***, **, * indicate
significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels. P-values are in parentheses.

Table C9: Granger-causality tests
The granger causality tests follow the strategy in Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012), who extend standard granger
causality models to panel data by allowing for heterogeneous coefficients in the cross-sectional dimension.
We use bootstrapping with 1,000 repetitions to compute p-values and allow for up to 36 lags to be included
in the models while leaving the lag order selection to AIC, BIC, and HQIC. To be conservative, we report
the lowest p-value resulting from the tests based on the three criteria. ***, **, * indicate significance at the
1%, 5% and 10% levels.
None of the tests rejects the null of a risk measure not granger causing one of our bubble measures. The
results thus support the findings from our linear probability models. Neither ∆CoVaR nor MES granger
causes real estate or stock market bubbles.

Table C11: The role of bank and bubble characteristics: global time FEs
Columns 1 and 2 restate our baseline regressions from Table 5, columns 6 and 7. Bubble estimates are based on the BSADF
approach. Macro controls are a banking crisis dummy, GDP growth, interest rates, inflation, and investment-to-GDP growth.
Variable definitions are provided in Table C1. Standard errors are clustered at the bank and time levels. ***, **, * indicate
significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels. P-values are in parentheses.

Table C12: Correlation between the business cycle indicator and bubble indicators
The business cycle indicator equals 1 during the boom phase of the business cycle and 0 otherwise. If business
cycles moved in line with financial cycles we would thus see a positive (negative) correlation between the
business cycle indicator and the bubble boom (bust) indicators. Hence, business cycles and financial cycles
do not significantly co-move in our sample.
