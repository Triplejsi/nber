of many who may not even be aware

of the existence of an academic

discipline called economics and its practitioners.
At the methodological level, I have become convinced more and more of

correctness of his view that representative agent models make for

therefore comes as no surprise that Jim Tobin studied this subject early in
his

career (Tobin (1952)) and returned co it time and again (e.g. Tobin

(1976, 1979,1980)),

with him on this subject matter (Buiter and Tobin (1979), Tobin and Butter
(1980)).

There is no better way to introduce the key issue than by quoting from
one of Jim's key writings on the subject.

2.5 Debt neutrality outside

the steady state

It is easily checked that all the neutrality propositions (such as
Propositions (5a,b), (Ga,b)) that apply to stationary equilibria extend to
non—steady state responses as long as the policy action or other exogenous
shock does not alter the "regimes"

(the gift or bequest constraints that

are binding and which may vary from generation to generation), for current
and future generations.

Consider an unexpected immediate permanent change

in d (financed with an increase in r1) in period t.

The

intertemporal

consistency of child—to—parent gift and bequest behaviour (see Burbridge

—28—
(1983) and Buiter and Carmichael (1984)) rules out the possibility of any

two generations airulcaneously wishing to make voluntary transfers

dynamic analysis of the Diamond (1965) model is applicable for that period.

with a tax on the young), the

public spending

of debt neutrality has implications for the

analysis of fiscal policy experiments

other than those involving

public

debt and iump—sum taxes.
