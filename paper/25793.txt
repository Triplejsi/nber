The Seniority Structure of Sovereign Debt

JEL No. F3,F4,F5,G1
ABSTRACT
Sovereign governments owe debt to many foreign creditors and can choose which creditors to
favor when making payments. This paper documents the de facto seniority structure of sovereign
debt using new data on defaults (missed payments or arrears) and creditor losses in debt
restructuring (haircuts). We overturn conventional wisdom by showing that official bilateral
(government-to-government) debt is junior, or at least not senior, to private sovereign debt such
as bank loans and bonds. Private creditors are typically paid first and lose less than bilateral
official creditors. We confirm that multilateral institutions such as the IMF and World Bank are
senior creditors.

Introduction

The typical debtor has many creditors. Hence, a debtor that is unable to pay must
choose which debts to repay and on which debts to default. For individual and corporate borrowers, contract and bankruptcy law determines which creditor gets repaid first;
creditor seniority is a straightforward legal issue. In contrast, for the foreign creditors of
a sovereign government, the lack of an international bankruptcy regime combined with
the difficulty of enforcing sovereign contracts makes creditor seniority a matter of custom
and convention. By this convention, the debts of multilateral government lenders such
as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank are senior to the debts of all
other government creditors, which are in turn senior to the bonds and bank loans owed
to private sector creditors.1 Relying on this convention, government creditors have been
able to lend at relatively low interest rates, even in times of financial distress.2
Is this seniority convention honored in practice? In this paper, we provide the first
systematic empirical study of the de facto seniority structure of external sovereign debt.
We construct two complementary measures of creditor seniority. Our primary measure
examines a sovereign defaulter’s relative tendency to default on different types of debt.
We use unpublished data on missed payments (also known as “arrears”) from the World
Bank’s Debtor Reporting System, supplemented by public data from the IMF, to measure
the extent to which 127 low- and middle-income countries prioritize repayment of debts
to different classes of creditors from 1979 to 2006. The novel dataset covers six classes
of creditors: the IMF; other multilateral creditors such as the World Bank and regional
development banks; bilateral official creditors, representing government-to-government
loans; commercial banks; bondholders; and trade creditors and suppliers. The second
measure captures the size of creditor losses (“haircuts”) resulting from the restructuring
of sovereign bank loans and bonds (using data from Cruces and Trebesch, 2013) and from
the restructuring of 414 bilateral official loans between 1978 and 2015 (using data from
Reinhart and Trebesch, 2019, and Tolvaisaite, 2010, that are updated here).
The results show a clear pecking order of sovereign debt repayments and default that is robust across both countries and time, and which holds after controlling for macroeconomic
fundamentals, debt composition, and fixed effects. Consistent with convention, the IMF
is the most senior creditor, followed by other multilateral creditors. Inconsistent with
convention, bilateral (government-to-government) official loans are not senior to private

creditors. That is, sovereigns facing repayment difficulties are more likely to default on
official bilateral creditors by missing payments more often and by larger amounts (relative to the amount of debt outstanding to that creditor group) than to either commercial
banks or bondholders. The average haircut suffered in sovereign debt restructurings is
also significantly higher for official creditors than for private creditors. In addition, we
find that trade creditors are at the bottom of the pecking order, which contrasts with the
convention that trade creditors are always senior (e.g., Kaletsky, 1985; Buchheit, 2013),
although we caution that this finding may reflect the particular set of long-term trade
credits for which we have data.
These results necessitate a substantial change in the way both policymakers and academics think about sovereign debt and default. For policymakers, the de facto junior
status of bilateral official loans suggests that these loans should either be repriced to
reflect the greater risk of delayed payments and losses or else be treated as subsidized (or
“concessional”) lending. For academics, our findings speak to the fundamental question
underlying all research on sovereign debt and default: why do countries ever repay their
debts? Benchmark models in the literature assume that the cost of default primarily
results from the economic dislocation associated with a default, and that this cost is
independent of the size and severity of the default. Our finding that sovereign borrowers
discriminate both between which creditors they default upon, as well as in the severity of
default, is strong evidence against this assumption. More importantly, the patterns we
observe are suggestive that the costs of default vary with the amounts of debt and the
type of creditors affected.
The observed pecking order of sovereign debt repayment could be explained as follows.
A default on IMF or World Bank loans is most consequential, as governments will be
cut off from crisis lending when it is most needed, and countries risk losing their voting
rights in these institutions (Reinhart and Trebesch, 2016b). Defaulting on bondholders
is highly visible in the international press and will result in downgrades by the major
credit rating agencies as well as potential legal disputes with specialized hedge funds.3 In
contrast, a sovereign default on commercial bank loans or bilateral official loans may be
less consequential. These defaults often occur “silently”, without much media coverage,
and may trigger less collateral damage. Sovereigns are aware that the consequences of
default depend in important ways on who the defaulted creditors are and what bargaining
power each creditor group has, so they prioritize their repayments accordingly.

Our paper contributes to several distinct literatures. First, our systematic empirical
study of creditor seniority in external sovereign debt markets complements the large and
well-established corporate finance literature on priority rules and seniority in bankruptcy
(see Franks and Torous, 1989; Gilson et al., 1990; Weiss, 1990; Hart and Moore, 1995;
Bolton and Scharfstein, 1996; Bebchuk, 2002; Bolton and Oehmke, 2015, to name just
a few). In contrast to this literature, we find that trade creditors are relatively junior
creditors in a sovereign context.
Second, our paper expands the treatment of seniority issues in the sovereign debt literature. To date, much of the focus of this literature has been on seniority within the same
group of creditors, and in particular the risk of debt dilution in sovereign bond markets
through the issuance of new short-term instruments (see, e.g., Zettelmeyer, 2005; Bolton
and Jeanne, 2009; Hatchondo et al., 2016; Chatterjee and Eyigungor, 2015; Ari et al.,
2018). In addition, some work has been done on the differential treatment of domestic as
opposed to international sovereign creditors both theoretically (in particular, Guembel
and Sussman, 2009; Broner et al., 2010, 2014) and empirically. On the empirical side,
Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer (2007), Erce and Diaz-Cassou (2010), Kohlscheen (2010),
Erce (2012), and Meyer (2019) find mixed evidence on discrimination between domestic
and external creditors, either by conducting case studies or by using Standard & Poor’s
binary simple indicator of external and domestic defaults. Our paper expands this literature by providing the first systematic analysis of discrimination between different classes
of external creditors.
Third, we add to research on the vast and largely unexplored universe of official sovereign
debts. The bulk of the sovereign debt and default literature focuses on debts owed to
private external creditors such as banks or bondholders (see Panizza et al., 2009; Aguiar
and Amador, 2014). These private creditors, however, account for only about half of all
debts owed by developing countries. Also, advanced countries such as Greece and Portugal
now owe large amounts of debt to official creditors. Here, we study private and official
defaults and creditor losses simultaneously and systematically, thus complementing a
small but growing empirical literature focusing on official debts (see, Chauvin and Kraay
(2005), Cheng et al. (2016, 2017), and Reinhart and Trebesch (2016a, 2016b, 2019)). The
results shed doubt on the view that all official creditors are senior to private creditors
(an assumption made by, among others, Corsetti et al., 2006; Boz, 2011; Fink and Scholl,
2016; Dellas and Niepelt, 2016; Roch and Uhlig, 2018). Moreover, we contribute to the
literature by showing new haircut estimates on official sovereign debt (government-togovernment loans) on a broad sample covering more than 400 restructurings and spanning

4

four decades (building on data by Tolvasaite, 2010, and Reinhart and Trebesch, 2019,
and expanding the exercise by Cheng et al. (2018)).
Finally, we add to the small literature that has focused on arrears as a measure of
sovereign default, including Easton and Rockerbie (1999) and Arellano et al. (2019).
Almost all other work on sovereign default has focused on measures of creditor losses or
haircuts resulting from a sovereign debt restructuring operation (see, e.g., Sturzenegger
and Zettelmeyer, 2008; Benjamin and Wright, 2009; Cruces and Trebesch, 2013). More
research on arrears is overdue, not least because the protracted nature of arrears makes
them a substantial burden for the individual creditor.4
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses basic concepts and definitions and provides an overview of existing views about, and policy claims on, seniority
in sovereign debt markets. In Section 3, we analyze creditor seniority based on a new
dataset on external sovereign debt arrears. We introduce measures of seniority and use
these to establish stylized facts of creditor seniority over different subsets of the sample
and over time. We also study the determinants of debt repayment and arrears across
creditor groups by running panel regressions. Section 4 compares haircuts on official and
private external creditors. We present the data, the procedure for estimating haircuts
for restructurings with the Paris Club, and the associated problems. We then present
stylized facts of sovereign debt restructurings and haircuts and an empirical framework
to assess the differential treatment of creditors during restructurings. Finally, we analyze the behavior of arrears during restructurings, thereby providing a synthesis with the
previous section. Section 5 concludes and gives an outlook for future research.

Seniority of sovereign debts - concepts and definitions

2.1

Basic concepts and creditor groups

The concept of seniority in sovereign lending is old,5 but it still lacks a clear definition.
Seniority captures the idea that sovereigns typically borrow from different creditors, both
domestic and external, in the form of various debt contracts and that they have in principle discretionary power to prioritize repayments of these claims. In the absence of
4

Having large amounts of non-performing debt that remain on the balance sheet for years is a burden to
almost every creditor. In addition, arrears are costly for various regulatory reasons. Financial institutions
such as banks have to set aside capital if a loan or bond has been in arrears for a while, even if they
think they will eventually be made whole in a restructuring.

The classic work by Borchard and Wynne (1951) documents that questions of priority among
sovereign creditors go back to at least the early 19th century.

an internationally enforceable insolvency scheme, their sovereignty allows governments
to provide preferential treatment to some creditors while discriminating against others.
While no de jure seniority structure exists in the sovereign context, a set of conventions are considered to guide government decisions in sovereign debt markets (Gelpern,
2004).

Data are from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) dataset. For IMF debts, we
use the variable “use of IMF credit” from the WDI.

At the most basic level, a distinction is made between domestic debt and external debt.
As data coverage on domestic debt is far from complete, empirical evidence in most cases
relies on case studies of sovereign debt restructurings with both domestic and external
creditors.6 We have no systematic data on arrears on domestic sovereign debt.
In this paper, we exclusively focus on external debts owed or guaranteed by the public
sector of sovereign countries as reported by the World Bank’s Debtor Reporting System

(DRS) and by the IMF (for IMF loans).7 That requires that we further restrict attention
to long-term debt, defined as debt with an original maturity of more than one year. Data
on short-term debts are not available broken down by borrower-creditor pair. Following
the definition of the World Bank, we distinguish six groups of external creditors:
(i) Bilateral creditors are official agencies that make loans on behalf of one government
to another government or to public and publicly guaranteed borrowers in another country. (ii) Multilateral loans are those made by official agencies owned or governed by more
than one country that provide loan financing. They include international financial institutions such as the World Bank, regional development banks, and other intergovernmental
agencies, but not the IMF. (iii) Sovereign bonds are debt instruments issued on capital
markets by public and publicly guaranteed debtors with durations of one year or longer.
(iv) Bank creditors are private banks that provide loans and other financial services, often in the form of syndicated lending. (v) Long-term trade credits and supplier credits
to the public sector include credits from manufacturers, exporters, and other sellers of
goods. (vi) The International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is a multilateral creditor but
treated as a separate category because of its unique position in the international financial
system.
The relative importance of these creditor groups has substantially fluctuated over time.
Figure 1 shows the share of each group’s outstanding debt in the total amount of public
and publicly guaranteed external debt over time for the sample of 127 developing and
emerging economies, which we will also use in the analysis of arrears in Section 3.
Two observations stand out in Figure 1. First, official debt accounts for a substantial share
of total sovereign debt, particularly in developing countries. In light of this observation,
there is surprisingly little research on defaults and the relative treatment of official versus
private creditors. One explanation is that the most widely used dataset on defaults and
haircuts by Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s or Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) focuses on
private creditors only, hence ignoring roughly half of the other claims in international
sovereign debt markets. Secondly, the relative importance of creditor groups shifts over
time. In particular, the share of bond debt relative to bank loans and trade credits
increased dramatically in the early 1990s following the Brady debt exchange deals.8 In
7

To measure external debt, the relevant criterion is the residency of the creditor. Domestic debt is
owed to residents, while external debt is owed by residents to nonresidents of a specific country (see
World Bank (2015)). Other definitions are related to the currency denomination or the governing law
under which the debt is issued.
8
Bolton and Jeanne (2009) interpret this shift from bank lending to bond contracts as the result of
differences in seniority across these instruments. Specifically, they argue that lenders endogenously shift
their funds into instruments that are more difficult to restructure, such as bonds, and hence enjoy a
higher seniority in the event of sovereign defaults. Although we do not examine this hypothesis, our
findings are consistent with this view.

7

addition, there seems to be a slight decline in the share of bilateral debt relative to
lending by multilateral creditors. In contrast, the shares of official debt and private debt
themselves have remained relatively stable.

2.2

Rules and conventions on sovereign debt seniority

As emphasized above, seniority in sovereign debt markets is guided by a set of informal
rules and conventions (see Roubini and Setser, 2003; Gelpern, 2004). First and foremost, there is the widespread view that official creditors are senior. Seniority protects a
supranational institution such as the IMF from defaults, thus allowing it to lend to crisis
countries at below-market interest rates and facilitating its role as an international lender
of last resort (Fischer, 1999). To safeguard its preferred status, the IMF has a policy of
not tolerating defaults and late payments, neither on its own loans nor on debts extended
by its member country governments (IMF, 2015).
However, the IMF’s senior status is not written in law. As explained by Martha (1990)
the preferred creditor status is not mentioned in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, and
it was not until the late 1980s that the institution formally endorsed it. At that point,
the IMF had taken on an active role to solve the developing country debt crisis and
faced mounting arrears - in excess of 10% of its total outstanding loans (see Reinhart and
Trebesch, 2016a). As a result, in 1988, the IMF Board of Governors urged “all members
within the limits of their laws to treat the Fund as a preferred creditor.”9 Today, the IMF
often refers to this endorsement and openly communicates its claim of being a preferred
creditor, for example, in its Annual Report on IMF Financial Operations.
On par with the IMF, the World Bank and regional financial institutions such as the
Asian Development Bank typically claim seniority as well. As explained on the World
Bank website: “The World Bank is recognized by the major rating agencies to enjoy a
preferred creditor status with its borrower-shareholders.” Accordingly, in a recent report,
Moody’s (2017) recognizes the World Bank’s (and International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development’s) “preferred creditor status, in which borrowing members pledge to
prioritize debt service to the IBRD over debt service to market and official bilateral
creditors.”
This “super-seniority” of the IMF and the World Bank rests on the beliefs of market
participants but also on the support of other official creditors, in particular, by the 22 large

creditor governments that are permanent members of the Paris Club. The Paris Club
is an informal forum set up to renegotiate bilateral official (government-to-government)
loans and thereby to grant debt relief. It has neither legal status nor statutory rules
of procedure, but it has become one of the main actors in solving debt crisis situations
and therefore plays an important role in influencing the pecking order of sovereign debt
repayment. In line with this setup, the IMF (2016, p.40) openly states that its “preferred
creditor status originates in the Paris Club, where official bilateral creditors have been
willing to exclude the IMF from the restructuring process.”10
Next in line are governments around the world, who also claim seniority for the loans they
extend. The Paris Club’s “comparability of treatment” principle dictates that “private
creditors (mainly banks, bondholders and suppliers)” should receive “a treatment on
comparable terms to those” granted by the Paris Club. Creditor governments thus expect
private creditors to share the burden – by accepting haircuts that are at least as high as
those negotiated by the Paris Club. Similarly, during the euro crisis, creditor governments
agreed that loans between governments would “in all cases” enjoy seniority “in order to
protect taxpayers’ money, and to send a clear signal to private creditors that their claims
are subordinated to official creditors.”11 We are not aware of a paper or evidence showing
whether or not these principles are enforced.
Indeed, despite these policy claims, there is little hard data or analysis to assess whether
official creditors are indeed senior. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the seniority claims
are not strictly binding. The seniority of the IMF has been repeatedly under threat,
including in the summer of 2015 when Greece briefly defaulted on its IMF payments
or during the 1980s when several low-income countries accumulated large IMF arrears
(Reinhart and Trebesch, 2016a).12 Regarding government-to-government debt, Roubini
(2001) writes that “debtors know that going into arrears to [bilateral official] creditors
has little consequence,” while a recent piece by Moody’s (2018) studies about 20 recent
debt crisis spells and concludes that official debt relief was often larger than the debt
relief granted by private creditors.
10

The only cases in which both the IMF and the World Bank agreed to debt write-downs occurred in
the wake of the so-called “Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative” to 36 poor and highly indebted countries
in the mid-2000s (see IMF, 2014).
11
See Statement by the Eurogroup, November 28, 2010. More precisely, the Treaty of 2011 states that
“ESM [European Stability Mechanism] loans will enjoy preferred creditor status in a similar fashion to
those of the IMF, while accepting preferred creditor status of the IMF over the ESM.” Note that ESM
loans or loans between Eurozone governments are not included in this analysis.
12
In an earlier paper, Bulow and Rogoff (1988) state that the data do “not square with the official
view that obligations to the IMF and the World Bank are senior claims.”

9

Recent events in Europe provide further evidence that official loans are not always senior.
The rescue loans granted by Eurozone governments to Portugal or Ireland were restructured in 2011 and 2013, as maturities were lengthened to 22 years and interest rates
were cut by half. These operations resulted in substantial present value relief on official
(taxpayer) debts. In contrast, private investors of Irish or Portuguese bonds avoided any
restructuring or relief operation. Also Greece benefited from multiple restructurings on
the debt it borrowed from other Eurozone governments. Debt maturities were extended
to the year 2060, a drastic present value debt relief. Moreover, the 55% haircut on private
bonds in 2012 would likely have been higher without the substantial official transfers (including ¿30bn in “cash sweeteners”offered to bondholders) that were financed via newly
issued loans from other governments (Zettelmeyer et al., 2013).
Within the group of private creditors, the literature offers little guidance on relative
seniority. One factor that has been brought up is the relative bargaining power of creditor
groups. For example, Bolton and Jeanne (2009) argue that international bonds are senior
to bank loans as they are more difficult to restructure because of the dispersion within the
creditor group. It is less costly for a sovereign to renegotiate terms with a few big banks
instead of a large number of individual bondholders. As a consequence, sovereigns might
be more inclined to default on bank loans rather than bond payments. Since creditors
anticipate this behavior, the result is a shift from bank to bond finance, as seen in Figure
1. A related argument is that trade creditors are senior because a default on them results
in an immediate and costly cut-off from trade (Kaletsky, 1985).

2.3

Arrears versus haircuts

Economists have defined seniority in the context of sovereign debt in different ways.13
Ultimately, however, seniority comes down to the order of repayment in case of financial
distress or default. Two questions are particularly relevant: When are debts (not) repaid
(repayment patterns during default)? And how severe is the write-down if claims are
eventually restructured (haircuts at the end of an often lengthy sovereign debt renegotiation process)? Both questions are typically (though not necessarily) interrelated, but do
matter separately, for example, because of regulatory reasons. We therefore explore both
arrears and haircut size in the remainder of the paper. As we will show, the patterns
13

In Chatterjee and Eyigungor (2015) seniority means that “in the event of default, a creditor who
lent earlier must be paid in full before a later creditor can be paid anything at all.” Steinkamp and
Westermann (2014) imply that seniority means that “the preferred lender gets his money back first,
in case of insolvency.” In contrast, Broner et al. (2014) interpret seniority as a higher probability of
repayment, and Bolton and Jeanne (2009) relate it to the relative bargaining power of different creditor
groups.

10

of arrears are diverse and vary considerably across countries, and the same is true for
haircuts.
Arrears are our first metric of choice to capture implicit seniority, for several reasons.
Arrears have a rich data structure, since they are observable from the beginning of a
default and they are timevarying, which is important because debt crises often take
many years (or even decades) to resolve. In contrast, haircuts are a snapshot measure
that is observable only at the end of a default or debt renegotiation spell. Arrears
are also collected in a standardized way from the World Bank and the IMF, to which
debtor country governments have an obligation to report. Moreover, arrears have broad
coverage. They are available for all the main external creditor groups in international
capital markets. In contrast, haircut estimates are available only for three groups: banks,
bondholders, and official (bilateral) loans restructured via the Paris Club of creditor
governments (a dataset newly introduced here).
Haircuts and arrears are highly correlated.14 The interdependence between arrears and
restructurings is illustrated for several country cases in Figures C.2 to C.7 in Appendix
C. The figures show official and private arrears (relative to GNI) together with dates of
official debt restructurings with the Paris Club or private debt restructurings.
Despite the high overall correlation of arrears and haircuts, there is heterogeneity between
debtors and cases. Some countries (such as Ethiopia or Nigeria) accumulate arrears
primarily on official debt, while others (such as Argentina or Ecuador) fail to pay their
private creditors. Others (such as Morocco or Peru) in turn run arrears on both official
and private lenders simultaneously. Arrears can be short-lived or protracted. They
can continue to increase after restructurings or can be fully resolved as in Argentina or
Ecuador in the 1990s. And some restructurings involve no arrears at all, meaning that
creditors agree to a haircut before any payments are missed. Asonuma and Trebesch
(2016) study this type of “preemptive” sovereign debt restructuring.
To summarize, there are a variety of perceptions and measurement approaches on seniority
in external sovereign debt markets, in both theoretical and applied work. What is lacking
is a solid and comprehensive empirical analysis. Our paper attempts to fill this gap.
14

In our data, the correlation coefficient between haircuts and accumulated arrears (to total private
debt) is 0.69 for private creditors.

Creditor seniority: evidence from missed payments

To measure seniority in sovereign debt markets, we compile a unique new dataset on
arrears by sovereign debtors toward six creditor groups. The creditor groups are defined
with respect to the debt contract under which they provide funds. Three of them are
official creditors (IMF, other multilaterals, bilateral governments) and three of them
private ones (banks, bondholders, trade creditors), as defined above.

3.1

The dataset: arrears across six creditor groups

Our arrears dataset is constructed from two sources. First and foremost, we obtain detailed data on payment arrears on government and government-guaranteed external debt
toward five creditor groups from the World Bank’s Debtor Reporting System (DRS),
which is the database underlying the Global Development Finance (GDF) and International Debt Statistics (IDS) publications. The DRS database includes loan-level information on all loan and credit agreements by all debtor countries that have committed
to report to the World Bank. For reasons of confidentiality, the World Bank publishes
aggregated data at the country level without a detailed breakdown by creditor and debtor
type. In particular, the arrears series that are publicly available do not distinguish between arrears by different types of private or public debtors.15 In contrast, our data allow
us to isolate the amount of arrears incurred by a country’s public sector (government +
public firms) and broken down toward five external creditor groups. In addition, we
obtain payment arrears on the IMF from the IMF Finances website.
Public sector arrears in the DRS database are defined as late payments as of end of year,
or more precisely as principal and interest payments due but not paid on long-term external debt obligations of public debtors or guaranteed by a public entity, thus including
government debt and government-guaranteed (quasi-sovereign) debt.16 Long-term external debt in the DRS is defined as debt that has a maturity of more than one year and
that is owed to nonresidents and is repayable in foreign currency. Arrears are measured
in current US dollars at the end of each year on a cumulative basis. Arrears toward the
15

For example, the publicly available World Bank series “Principal arrears, private creditors” counts
arrears toward private external creditors (bondholders, banks) but combines all debts of a country; that
is, it adds together late payments by governments, the public sector, and private firms as a total, without
a breakdown by type of debtor.

12

IMF are measured in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) and converted to US dollars using
December averages of the SDR-dollar exchange rate from the IMF website.17
The database captures defaults (missed payments) toward the entire spectrum of a government’s external creditors. This contrasts earlier work that typically uses data by
Standard & Poor’s (S&P) or Reinhart and Rogoff (2009), who capture defaults toward
private creditors (bondholders and banks) but not toward official creditors (see Appendix
A for a comparison). The arrears data thus provide a more complete picture of creditor
seniority.
To measure the share of arrears per unit of lending, we match the arrears data with
disaggregated debt stock data of the face values of public and publicly guaranteed debt
by creditor group, which we also obtain from the DRS dataset.18 For the debt owed
to the IMF, we use the “use of IMF credit” stock variable from the World Bank, also
measured in current US dollars. These IMF data are available for all but 5 countries for
which we have data on payment arrears from the DRS.19 In addition, we choose to drop
two countries (Afghanistan and Montenegro) that have observations on debt stocks for
only two years. In line with the DRS documentation, we code arrears as zero whenever
debt stock data are available and arrears are not reported.
The result is an unbalanced panel of sovereign arrears toward six external creditor groups
covering 127 countries and up to 28 years. The time coverage by country ranges from
8 to 28 years. Data for all years are available for roughly 75% of the sample countries.
Formerly communist countries in Eastern Europe enter the sample in the early 1990s
when they became members of the World Bank and IMF.
The data show that sovereign arrears are widespread and sizable. On average, 8.0%
of the stock of public and publicly guaranteed external debt is in arrears. However,
there is a large amount of heterogeneity across creditor groups, with some creditors
being particularly likely to suffer from arrears, as we will show below. The data also
show that defaults are partial, as emphasized by Arellano et al. (2019) and Meyer et al.
17
To ensure comparability of the data, we restrict IMF arrears to payments that are six or more months
overdue and use end-of-year IMF data.
18
There are 31 countries in our sample for which we have disaggregated data on arrears but not on debt
stocks. For these countries, we substitute the aggregate debt stock data from the World Bank’s WDI
dataset, which is available on the creditor level. The comparison of the debt stock data for countries for
which both sets of data are available shows that there are no significant inconsistencies between the two
sources. This is to be expected since the disaggregated data are the raw data underlying the WDI.
19
Data on IMF debt stocks is not available for Croatia, Iraq, Latvia, Russia, and the Slovak Republic.
Yet, these omissions are not likely to alter the results much because arrears are quantitatively small
(less than 1% of GNI on average, except for Russia), and the pecking order as measured by the share of
creditor-specific arrears in total arrears does not qualitatively differ from the results presented here.

13

(2019). Countries usually continue to make partial debt service payments at the same
time that they accumulate arrears. Symbolic token payments are also frequent. Indeed,
and quite remarkably, there are only three observations in the entire sample with a
full payment suspension (i.e., with zero debt service payments and complete arrears
accumulation).

3.2

Measuring creditor seniority from arrears: methods and stylized facts

This section presents new stylized facts on implicit creditor seniority in sovereign debt
markets of the past decades. We start by describing our approach to measure discrimination and show results for the entire sample. We then refine the analysis by looking at
specific subsamples and at the seniority measures over time.
To capture the heterogeneous treatment of creditors, we propose two alternative measures
of creditor seniority based on the arrears data. The first captures the scope of arrears
per unit of lending of each creditor group, irrespective of the scope of lending and arrears
to other creditors. The second measure is more sophisticated and captures the relative
distribution of arrears across creditor groups, controlling for the debt composition of each
sovereign. For each measure, we then compare the results for the six creditor groups for
the entire sample and various subsamples.
The first measure is simple and quantifies the absolute scope of arrears per unit of lending.
The arrears-to-debt ratio of creditor group k at time t in country i is defined as
AT Di,t,k =

arrearsi,t,k
.
debti,t,k + arrearsi,t,k

(1)

This measure normalizes arrears by the nominal stock of public and publicly guaranteed
debt of each creditor group. Debt stocks are adjusted for the level of arrears so that
AT Ds are bounded below by 0 and bounded above by 1. This also allows us to interpret
the denominator as the total amount of payments due in case debts can be accelerated,
that is, if creditors are legally entitled to receive the entire face value of their claim upon
default (as is customary for sovereign bonds).
The pecking order of external sovereign debt implied by the AT D measure is illustrated
in Figure 2, which shows the unweighted average of the AT D in the full sample. There is
a clear seniority structure: bonds, IMF credit, and multilateral loans are senior, whereas
bilateral loans, bank loans, and trade credits are junior. Arrears-to-debt ratios are lowest
for the IMF (2.5% on average) and highest for exporters and suppliers (more than 20%

14

of their outstanding claims on average). These averages are biased by outliers, however.
For the IMF, for example, the occurrence of arrears is rare, but once arrears occur, they
tend to accumulate fast, resulting in a high ATD.
The ATD measure is simple and intuitive, but it has an important disadvantage: it does
not account for the debt composition and the relative arrears burden across creditor
groups. To see this, take a low-income country that receives much official lending but has
limited access to international bond markets. In a crisis, such a country is likely to accumulate arrears mostly toward its main lenders: official creditors. If low-income countries
are also more likely to enter a crisis or miss payments in the first place, then the high
average ATDs to official creditors in Figure 2 could merely reflect country fundamentals
and the (in-)ability to tap private capital markets. Hence, a high ATD ratio for banks or
bilateral loans does not necessarily imply that these creditors are junior.
As an alternative, we therefore propose a measure that captures the relative distribution
of arrears controlling for country debt composition and, thus, for differences in external
borrowing patterns. The relative percentage in arrears (RP IA) captures the difference
between the arrears-to-debt ratio of a specific creditor group k and the total arrears-todebt ratio of a country:
RP IAi,t,k

P
arrearsi,t,k
k arrearsi,t,k
.
−P
=
debti,t,k + arrearsi,t,k
k (debti,t,k + arrearsi,t,k )

(2)

Intuitively, in equation (2), the average arrears ratio (as a percentage of total sovereign
debt) serves as a benchmark to evaluate discrimination. Creditors are favored if they
face lower arrears per unit of debt than the average creditor. Conversely, a creditor
group is discriminated against if it faces higher arrears per unit of debt than the average
creditor. The RP IA is bounded in [-1,1] with a positive sign indicating discrimination
and a negative sign indicating favoritism. A value of zero indicates fair treatment.
More specifically, the RP IA of a creditor group k is closely related to a weighted average
of the arrears-to-debt ratios of all creditor groups via the following expression:
RP IAi,t,k = AT Di,t,k −

X
k

dsi,t,k · AT Di,t,k ,

(3)

where dsi,t,k is the debt share of group k (i.e., the fraction of creditor group k’s debt
stock (adjusted for arrears) in the total debt stock of country i at time t). Hence, by
construction the RP IA will always be zero if a country borrows from one group only,
irrespective of the level of the arrears to this group. In addition, the RP IA formula

assigns a higher weight to country-year observations with higher arrears-to-debt ratios,
which is relevant when aggregating RP IAs over countries or time.
For illustration, consider a country with two creditors that chooses to default only toward
creditor 1 while creditor 2 is fully paid. Let x denote the share in total debt and arrears
of creditor 1. Then, the RP IA of creditor 1 equals (1 − x) · AT D1 > 0, where the RP IA2
is simply given by the negative of the total arrears-to-debt ratio. In the limit when all
funds are provided by creditor 1, RP IA1 approaches zero, indicating a fair treatment
despite the concentration of arrears. Similarly, when all funds are provided by creditor
2, RP IA1 approaches the arrears-to-debt ratio of creditor 1.
Figure 3 summarizes RP IAs for the six creditor groups for the full sample. The results
confirm the pecking order observed above. Bilateral creditors, banks, and trade creditors
have positive RP IAs, indicating discrimination, while multilateral creditors and the IMF
have negative ratios. Bondholders have the lowest RP IA within the group of private
creditors. Exporters and suppliers are most heavily discriminated against: their AT D is
12.6 percentage points higher than the representative creditor. The IMF is most favored,
with an AT D that is 6.2 percentage points lower compared to the average creditor.
The pecking order we observe in Figures 2 and 3 holds when we weight each country by
the size of its debt stock so as to mimic a world portfolio of debt (and arrears). It also
holds when we use arrears-to-debt ratios without adjusting the debt stock for the stock
of arrears, although we get higher arrears ratios on average.
The AT Ds vary notably across countries and subsamples. Figure 4 shows the average
arrears-to-debt ratios for different income groups based on the classification of the World
Bank, where “high income” denotes “high income” or “upper middle income” countries
as of 2015, including countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Panama, or Peru. As
expected, average AT Ds are highest for countries in the lower income group and lowest
for countries in the highest income group. Yet, the pecking order is qualitatively similar
in each sub-sample we look at. Bonds, IMF credit, and multilateral loans remain senior
in all income groups, whereas bilateral loans, bank loans, and trade credits are junior.
The ordering is the same when we use other GDP per capita criteria.
The ordering is similar in a breakdown by world regions, using the regional classification
of the World Bank. The level of arrears is particularly high in sub-Saharan Africa, which
includes most of the low-income countries in the sample. However, the implied pecking

order is again largely unaffected. Bonds, IMF credit, and multilateral loans are senior in
all regions, whereas bilateral loans, bank loans, and trade credits are junior.20
This pecking order is also unaffected if we cut the sample by political regimes, by countries
with and without access to international capital markets, or by type of exchange rate
regime. Table C.1 in Appendix C summarizes average RP IAs for different country
groups. Bilateral creditors are discriminated against in all subsets except for the Middle
East and North Africa region. Similarly, the average RP IA is positive for banks and
trade creditors in all subsets except for banks in East Asia. In contrast, multilateral
creditors and the IMF are always favored. Similarly, bondholders are senior to other
private creditors in all subsamples. Taken together, the pecking order is remarkably
stable, although the extent of seniority differs across subsets of the sample.
The patterns we observe are also relatively stable across time. Between 1979 and 2006,
the seniority order (as measured by RP IAs) has remained fairly similar, as shown in
Figure 5. The relative seniority of multilateral lenders and the IMF can be observed in
each decade. Similarly, the discrimination against banks and trade creditors has occurred
in all years, with banks faring the worst in the late 1980s and early 1990s, just prior to
the Brady debt exchanges that resolved the developing country debt crisis. The most
notable qualitative change in seniority can be observed for bilateral lenders, which were
slightly favored until the early 1990s but have been increasingly discriminated against
since then.

3.3

Determinants of seniority: fundamentals, country and time effects

In this section, we study whether the observed pecking order holds once we account
for observable characteristics of countries and creditor groups. For example, bilateral
lenders might face higher arrears simply because they lend more extensively to low-income
countries compared to bondholders or the IMF. To account for such a possibility, we can
control for the income level of countries and the scope of bilateral lending. If the different
treatment of creditor groups cannot be explained away with standard macroeconomic
and political variables, then we have a more convincing case that discrimination is at
work. The unexplained part of the AT D and RP IA ratios will capture creditor seniority
in a narrower sense.
20

East Asia is an exception since the IMF faces higher average arrears than banks, mainly because of
two outliers: Cambodia and Vietnam. There are also smaller shifts in the relative ranking within the
set of junior and senior creditors.

19

We follow two empirical strategies to separate the role of observable from unobservable
characteristics: first, a plain-vanilla OLS regression approach and, second, the OaxacaBlinder counterfactual decomposition technique, which has been widely used to identify
discrimination in labor markets. The RP IA ratios, our favorite metric of creditor discrimination, are the main dependent variable.
The pooled OLS regressions use creditor-specific RPIAs and ATDs as the dependent
variable, so that there are up to six observations for each country-year spell. To detect
discrimination, we include dummies for each of the creditor groups. The intuition behind
this approach is simple. The effect of observable fundamentals will be captured by the
control variables, while (unexplained) creditor-specific effects will be picked up by the
creditor dummies. If there are systematic differences in the rate of arrears accumulation
across creditor groups, then the creditor dummies should be significantly different from
zero. Specifically, we use the following regression framework:
yi,t,k = X i,t,k β +

K−1
X

αk Ik + ui,t,k ,

(4)

k=1

where yi,t,k is our default measure (in particular, RP IAs) and X i,t,k is the vector of control
variables that may include dummies for each country and for each year to capture countryfixed and year-fixed effects. The main focus lies on the αk coefficients of the dummies
for each creditor group k where k = K refers to the benchmark category (here: bilateral
creditors). The variable Ik will capture creditor seniority effects under the assumption of
equal sensitivities toward Xi,t,k . The variables ui,t,k are standard errors clustered at the
country level.
This framework is an intuitive way to separate the discriminatory component from the
effects of economic fundamentals. The ranking of creditors is easy to interpret - both
qualitatively and quantitatively. The main limitation is that this approach assumes that
sovereigns (should) behave equally across creditors in response to changing economic conditions. Specifically, the coefficients for each control variable are assumed to be the same
for each creditor group, which is unlikely to be true. Indeed, when running regressions
for the determinants of discrimination for each creditor group separately, we observe substantial differences in the estimated betas for the set of control variables. This indicates
that, across creditor groups, arrears react differently to changes in fundamentals.
The Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition technique helps to relax the assumption of equal
sensitivities across creditors. The approach is based on Blinder (1973) and Oaxaca (1973)
and is commonly used in the literature on labor market discrimination, for example, to
20

estimate the gender wage gap. The basic idea is to decompose an outcome variable of
interest into explained and unexplained variation using a set of control variables. More
precisely, the technique attributes the difference in mean outcomes to two sources: differences in observable characteristics and differences in factor sensitivities. For example,
high arrears to bank creditors relative to bondholders could be the result of more intense
borrowing from banks, for example, because countries have no access to bond financing.
Alternatively, sovereigns could generally be more inclined to accumulate arrears toward
bank creditors rather than toward bondholders. The first explanation reflects fundamental differences, while the second one is interpreted as discriminatory behavior. The
Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition technique allows us to separate these effects by controlling for differences in control variables across creditors. The unexplained component then
allows us to back out the scope of creditor discrimination.
Formally, consider a standard linear regression model that relates our discrimination
measure yi,t , the RP IAs, to a set of fundamentals X i,t and the error term ui,t for each
creditor group k:
yi,t = X i,t β k + ui,t ,
(5)
Let β̂ k denote the vector of estimated coefficients for creditor group k. We estimate this
regression separately for each creditor group via pooled OLS including dummy variables
for country-fixed and time-fixed effects in the vector of control variables.21 The difference
in mean RP IAs between two creditor groups m and n can then be decomposed as
∗

∗

∗

RP IAm − RP IAn = (Xm − Xn )β̂ m,n + Xm (β̂ m − β̂ m,n ) + Xn (β̂ m,n − β̂ n ),

(6)

where X refer to the sample means of the control variables. This decomposition assumes
∗
∗
the existence of a fair pricing vector β̂ m,n . For example, β̂ m,n would tell us by how much
the RP IA should increase if a creditor’s debt-to-GNI ratio increases by one unit given fair
treatment. However, this vector is not observable and hence needs to be approximated.
In the labor market literature on wage discrimination, it is commonly approximated by
the coefficient vector of male workers who are assumed to face no wage discrimination.
∗
Since we do not know which creditor group faces fair treatment, we obtain β̂ m,n by
estimating (5) in a pooled regression for the groups m and n (i.e., by making pairwise
comparisons).
Applying decomposition (6), we can attribute differences in RP IAs to the two sources
discussed above:
21

OLS is the standard approach for Oaxaca-Blinder in the literature and convenient to estimate.

21

∗

 The first term (Xm − Xn )β̂ m,n measures differences in RP IAs that result from dif-

ferences in the control variables across creditor groups. For instance, higher arrears
to bank creditors relative to bondholders as the result of more intense borrowing
from banks are captured by this term.
∗

∗

 The second term Xm (β̂ m − β̂ m,n ) + Xn (β̂ m,n − β̂ n ) is the difference in RP IAs that

results from differences in the estimated factor sensitivities β̂ k across creditors.
For instance, this term captures the higher inclination of sovereigns to accumulate
arrears toward bank creditors rather than bondholders for a given amount of borrowing. This term constitutes discrimination since these differences would prevail
even if creditor groups had equal characteristics.
As explained, decomposition (6) can only be used for pair-wise comparisons. We therefore
show results for each pair of creditor groups separately.
To select control variables, we follow earlier work on the determinants of default and
debt arrears, in particular Detragiache and Spilimbergo (2001) and Manasse and Roubini
(2009), and consider a broad set of macroeconomic and financial variables that are potential drivers of arrears and creditor discrimination. We first account for the scale and
composition of sovereign debt by including the debt-to-GNI ratio toward each creditor
group (adjusted for arrears). This is our only group-specific set of control variables. Since
our discrimination measure is already adjusted for creditor-specific debt stocks, including
this variable will capture potential overproportional effects of debts on arrears. Moreover,
we include the ratio of total external debt to GNI. We also account for the general level
of development, which is important for the default behavior of countries, as indicated by
Figure 4. Specifically, we include real GDP per capita as well as current and lagged real
GDP growth as reported in the World Bank’s WDI dataset. Moreover, we account for financial crises by including a dummy variable for systemic banking crises and for currency
crises from Laeven and Valencia (2012), and we control for political turmoil by including
a dummy for ongoing external or civil wars obtained from the Correlates of War dataset.
The ability of countries to borrow in international capital markets is another potential
determinant of arrears. We control for this by including a dummy variable that indicates
whether a country is eligible for the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility as
proposed by IMF staff (Allen, 2008).
We consider additional control variables, although adding these comes at the cost of a
smaller sample, so they are only included as a robustness check (in the specifications with
the “Full Set of Controls”). Specifically, to account for the level of financial development,
we include the share of private debt in total external debt and a proxy of financial open-

22

ness using Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007) (assets plus liabilities, in percentage of GNI).
We control for macroeconomic fundamentals by including trade openness (exports plus
imports, in percentage of GNI), gross investments to GNI and CPI inflation. Moreover,
we include three liquidity proxies, namely, the ratio of short-term external debt to GNI,
foreign reserves as a fraction of total external debt, and debt service on PPG and IMF
debt as a fraction of annual exports. The data for these variables are obtained from the
WDI.
Table C.2 in Appendix C provides an overview of the variables and their sources, differentiating by basic control variables that are always included and additional controls that
are only added in some specifications. To mitigate concerns of endogeneity, we lag all
explanatory variables by one period; only real GDP growth enters in both contemporary
and lagged form.
Table 1 shows the pooled OLS results focusing on the creditor-specific dummies, while
the full regression results are shown in Table C.3 in Appendix C. The pecking order
described in the last section is confirmed by these results. All creditor dummies have
the expected sign and are statistically significant at the 1% level except for bonds. The
coefficients for multilateral creditors, the IMF, and bondholders are negative, indicating
that these groups face significantly lower arrears per unit of debt and a lower RP IA than
the benchmark category (bilateral creditors). In contrast, banks and trade creditors face
significantly higher arrears per unit of lending and a higher RP IA. In columns 2-4 we
add country-fixed effects and time-fixed effects, as well as a richer set of control variables,
respectively. Adding these explanatory variables improves the fit of our regression but
barely changes the results for the creditor dummies.
As a robustness check, we account for the fact that arrears (RP IAs) are highly persistent
over time, by adding a one-period lag of the dependent variable as an additional regressor
in column 5. This considerably improves the fit of the regression and decreases the size
of the creditor dummies. However, the dummies remain statistically significant and
imply the same seniority structure. We also estimate equation (4) using the arrearsto-debt ratios as the dependent variable. Column 6 shows results for the pooled OLS
estimation (with country and year dummies), while column 7 shows coefficients from a
Tobit regression, to account for the truncated nature of the data as arrears and AT Ds
cannot be negative. These estimates are qualitatively similar to those using the RP IA
measure. Only the Tobit coefficients for IMF and bondholder creditors change, reflecting
the fact that arrears to these creditors generally occur less often than to other groups.
Bondholders are significantly favored relative to bilateral creditors once we take into
account that arrears occur far less frequently.

Table 2 summarizes the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition results. We always include
the set of basic control variables listed above and in Table C.2 of Appendix C as well as
country- and year-fixed effects.
The first column shows mean differences in RP IAs for each creditor pair. A negative
sign indicates that the scope of arrears (RP IAs) of the first creditor group is lower than
that of the second group; that is, the first creditor of the pairing is senior in the raw data.
Accordingly, a positive sign is an indication of seniority for the second creditor.
The difference in RP IAs is then decomposed into differences that are attributable to
differences in fundamentals (column 2) and differences that are unexplained, indicating
discrimination (column 3). The last column shows the share of the RP IA difference that
cannot be explained by the control variables, which can be interpreted as the intensity of
discrimination. Consider, for example, the aforementioned comparisons of bank creditors
and bondholders, which are illustrated in the third row from the bottom in Table 2. On

Note: The table shows the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition for the mean difference in RPIAs across creditor
groups. The mean difference is listed in the first column. The second and third columns show the part of the
difference that is fundamentally justified and the part of the difference that is unexplained and thus reflects active
creditor discrimination. The last column states the fraction of the mean difference that reflects discrimination in
percent. Note that mean differences vary from the sample statistics because of data availability with respect to the
explanatory variables.

average, bondholders face an RP IA that is 8.5 percentage points lower than banks (i.e.,
they appear to be favored). Around 60% of this difference (5.2 pp) can be attributed to
differences in observable characteristics. This might be because bondholders prefer lending to richer countries or during economic booms and hence face lower arrears. However,
roughly 40% of the difference (3.4 pp) cannot be attributed to these factors and hence
represents discriminatory treatment of banks or favoritism toward bondholders.
The average unexplained component is large, accounting for about 60% of the mean
difference in RP IAs across creditor groups. This is a strong indication of creditor discrimination. Fundamentals can only explain a sizable part of the arrears difference for
three pairings: multilaterals versus the IMF, bondholders versus banks, and bondholders
versus trade creditors.
As a robustness check, we again account for serial correlation by adding the lagged dependent variable as an additional regressor. Table C.4 in Appendix C shows the correspond-

25

ing Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition. The discriminatory component averages around 12%,
which is substantially lower than before although still sizable.
To summarize, the results in this section confirm the stylized facts above. There is a
clear and robust pecking order of sovereign debt during defaults that holds even when
controlling for a wide variety of macroeconomic and political factors that might affect
the discriminatory behavior of sovereigns.

Creditor seniority in sovereign debt restructurings

In this section, we turn to the outcome of sovereign debt restructurings by comparing the
implied size of creditor losses (haircuts) on private and official debt.
We use the haircut estimates by Cruces and Trebesch (2013) for haircuts on private external creditors, which cover 187 restructurings of bank loans and bond debt since the
late 1970s. For haircuts on official external creditors, we build on data by Tolvaisaite
(2010) and Reinhart and Trebesch (2019), which provides haircut estimates for more
than 400 Paris Club restructurings. As explained, the Paris Club of large creditor country governments has been the main forum for renegotiating official debt over the past
decades.22 Cheng et al. (2017) provide an overview of the history and operations of the
Paris Club.

4.1

Haircut estimation approach

To measure creditor losses (haircuts) in sovereign debt restructurings, we follow the literature, in particular, Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer (2008), Benjamin and Wright (2009),
and Cruces and Trebesch (2013). Specifically, we apply the following formula to all
restructurings since 1978 for which sufficient data are available:

Haircut = 1 −

Present Value of New Debt
.
Face Value of Old Debt

(7)

We thus compare the face value of the old debt to the present value of the new debt
received in the wake of the restructuring. Using face values of the old outstanding debt
22
There are also a number of debt restructurings with official creditors outside the Paris Club forum.
However, systematic information and data availability on these deals are even more limited than on the
Paris Club. Hence, we choose to focus on the Paris Club, which accounts for a large majority of all
official debt renegotiations.

26

is more simplistic than the approach by Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer (2008) and Cruces
and Trebesch (2013), who use present values for both the old and new debts, but this
shortcut is helpful for the context of this paper. This formula is also widely used by
market participants and by credit rating agencies.23 The main advantage of using face
value amounts of the old debt here is that this approach requires fewer assumptions and
no data on the characteristics of the old debt, which is not always available for official
loans.
Whichever method, we are ultimately interested in the relative performance of private
and official creditors during restructurings so that the choice of the haircut estimation
methodology should not be decisive as long as it is consistent across groups.

4.2

Haircuts on official debt - dataset and assumptions

The haircut estimates on bilateral government-to-government debts are based on a number of assumptions regarding interest rates, debt payment profiles, and discounting. Due
to the limited transparency of the Paris Club, we lack detailed loan-level data and do
not always have the full restructuring terms. The estimated haircuts should therefore be
taken with care. This is particularly true for restructurings in the 1980s since the Paris
Club provides only limited data for this period.
With these limitations in mind, the estimates allow us to compare haircuts borne by private versus official creditors for the first time, thus complementing our analysis of arrears
patterns. We present our assumptions and the resulting limitations as transparently as
possible. Moreover, we check the robustness of our estimates in various ways and explore
how each of our main assumptions affects the results. Future research may provide more
accurate estimates on haircuts in official debt restructurings, although this result will
require better data and more transparency on the part of official creditors and the Paris
Club.
At the center of each Paris Club debt restructuring is the final agreement, also called the
“Agreed Minutes.” The Agreed Minutes are agreed by all members and provide a guideline for the bilateral agreements with each creditor government, which legally formalize
the debt relief (see Appendix B for details).24 The terms of the Agreed Minutes are for
23

For a detailed discussion on the different approaches to estimate haircuts, see Sturzenegger and
Zettelmeyer (2008), Cruces and Trebesch (2013), and Meyer et al. (2019).
24
Unfortunately, the specific bilateral agreements that actually provide debt relief are not publicly
available. Hence, we trust that the Agreed Minutes are a sufficiently reliable indicator for the bilateral
terms.

27

the most part standardized and have evolved over time. The 1980s mainly saw short- and
medium-term reschedulings in the form of maturity extensions, but over the course of the
1990s and 2000s, the terms became increasingly concessionary, with more comprehensive
debt relief and debt stock cancellations.25 The Agreed Minutes contain details on the
consolidation period, the cutoff date, the grace and maturity periods of the new debt, and
the amounts of restructured debt as well as potential write-offs. This information is the
main input for the estimation of haircuts on Paris Club restructurings. We compare and
complement the information from the Paris Club website with details from other sources.
These include a survey of debt restructurings with official creditors from the Institute of
International Finance (2001), information from the Global Development Finance reports,
as well as the IMF’s Annual Reports on Official Financing for Developing Countries.26
In case of inconsistencies, we use the Paris Club data.
Our final sample includes 414 Paris Club debt restructurings between 1978 and 2015.27
Restructurings were particularly frequent during the developing country debt crisis that
started in the early 1980s and continued well into the 1990s. Since the mid-2000s, the
number of agreements has declined substantially.
Since face value data are provided by the Paris Club, most assumptions concern the
calculation of present values in (7). These are calculated as follows:
Present Value of the New Debt =

T
X
Debt Servicej (rds )
,
j
(1
+
r
)
discount
j=t

(8)

0

where t0 is the date in which the first interest or principal payment is due (after a potential
grace period), T is the maturity of the new debt, rds is the interest rate charged on the
new debt, and rdiscount is the relevant discount rate. In the following we will discuss
our main assumptions regarding the interest rate rds , the discount rate rdiscount , the debt
repayment profile (including any potential write-offs), and the composition of restructured
debt. Some of the assumptions depend on the type of debt. Indeed, since the late 1980s,
the Paris Club allows for differential treatment of official development aid (ODA) and
other types of debt (non-ODA). In case of ODA debt the grace and maturity periods
25
Martin and Vilanova (2001), Gueye et al. (2007), and Cheng et al. (2016, 2017) provide a more
detailed overview of the different terms. See also Appendix B for a summary.
26
In particular, we refer to the appendices of the 2002, 2003, and 2006 Global Development Finance
reports.
27
There are a small number of Paris Club deals before 1978, starting with Argentina in 1956. We do
not include these deals because of limited data availability and also because we lack the counterfactual
haircut estimates for private creditors. For an overview of early Paris Club deals, see Das et al. (2012).

28

are more generous, while non-ODA debt can receive partial write-offs, particularly for
low-income countries.
Interest rate: The interest rate on restructured Paris Club debt is called the moratorium
interest rate. According to the terms of the Paris Club, moratorium interest rates are
based on the original interest rate of the loan for ODA debt, the “appropriate market
rate” (non-ODA debt, option A), or reduced interest rates (non-ODA debt, option B).28
Unfortunately, the rates actually agreed on bilaterally are not publicly available, and we
do not know what share of the debt falls under each of these options. The Paris Club
only provides a vague definition of the “appropriate market rate” from which reduced
rates are derived. Importantly, none of these rates contains a country-risk premium.29
Hence, we need to make assumptions with respect to the interest rate in our calculations.
We assume that each rescheduling is based on the appropriate market rate. We proxy
this rate by the average terms of borrowing (ATB) by official creditors from the World
Bank’s GDF dataset. This rate is representative for the average interest rate set by official
creditors for a particular debtor.30 Data coverage is almost comprehensive since the ATB
is available for all but 6 restructurings. In addition, Reinhart and Trebesch (2016a) also
use this rate to calculate debt service payments in their baseline estimates.31
Discount rate: To discount debt payment streams, we consider two alternative rates:
 The baseline estimates rely on the Paris Club’s own discounting approach, using the

commercial interest reference rate (CIRR) for the US dollar prevailing in the year
and month of the restructuring (see Mandeng, 2004). CIRR is essentially a riskfree rate that represents the funding cost of advanced countries. More specifically,
CIRRs are currency-specific interest rates for major advanced countries defined
as “minimum interest rates that shall apply to official financing support under the
Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits” (see OECD website). Besides
the Paris Club, the World Bank and the IMF also calculate official debt relief based
on a weighted average of CIRRs for different currencies (see IMF, 2014). In addition,
28

For an overview, see, for example, Martin and Vilanova (2001) or the website of the Paris Club.
The Paris Club defines the “appropriate market rate” as the “interest rate defined in bilateral
agreements implementing the Paris Club Agreed Minutes, based upon standard interest rates of the
currency considered, plus a management fee. This rate may be fixed or variable and does not include a
country-risk premium.”
30
This rate is defined as follows: “Average terms of borrowing on public and publicly guaranteed debt
are given for all new loans contracted during the year and separately for loans from official and private
creditors. Annual average interest rate is obtained by weighting by the amounts of the loans.”
31
An alternative proxy is the six-month USD-based Libor that prevailed in the year and month of the
restructuring deal, using data from the IMF. Yet, unlike the average terms of borrowing, the Libor rate
is not specific to the debtor country. As a robustness check, we also conduct the analysis with the Libor
as an interest rate proxy. The results do not change qualitatively.
29

29

CIRR data are widely available, allowing us to compute haircuts for 397 out of 414
Paris Club deals. However, this rate is not country-specific and does not reflect the
market assessment of country risks. We take the resulting haircut estimates as a
lower bound.
 Alternatively, we use a market-based discounting approach, which allows to compare
haircuts on private and official creditors based on the same discount rates. The idea
is to run a fair horse race between the two types of estimates and to view official debt
through the lens of a risk-averse taxpayer who discounts future repayments with a
commercial rate. Specifically, we follow the discounting approach by Cruces and
Trebesch (2013) for private debt restructurings and use their computed “exit yields”
that vary by country and month to compute haircuts for Paris Club restructurings.
This is possible for 323 out of the 414 deals.32 The exit yield is the interest rate that
would have been used by the market participants at the exit of each restructuring
if the holder of the restructured instrument wanted to sell it. Put differently, the
exit yield is a proxy for future default risk right after the restructuring has been
implemented. The resulting haircut estimates are taken as an upper bound.
Restructuring options, amortization schedules, and write-offs:
 We distinguish between ODA and non-ODA debt whenever information on the

distribution is provided by the Paris Club. This is the case for most restructurings
since the late 1990s, namely 75 Paris Club deals. In addition, for 178 restructurings
under Classic Terms (see Appendix B for definitions), we know that the Paris Club
creditors made no distinction between ODA and non-ODA debts. For all other
cases (around 40% of the sample), we assume that all debts are non-ODA debt when
terms of middle-income countries apply (34 restructurings under Houston Terms)
and ODA debt when terms of low-income countries apply (112 restructurings under
Toronto, London, Naples, Lyons, and Cologne Terms).
 Debtor countries can often choose between two rescheduling options for non-ODA
debt. Under option A, debtors receive a partial debt stock cancellation and the new
debt is issued with market interest rates. Alternatively, they can choose option B
without debt stock cancellation but at a below-market interest rate and longer grace
and maturity periods. We know the option chosen for the majority of restructurings,
but lack this information for around one-fourth of the cases (112 out of 414). Since
most restructurings in this subset are by low-income debtors, we treat all debts as
32

We lack imputed market rates for about 20% of the sample, mostly mostly because the poorest
countries have little to no market information such as credit ratings. Indeed, 77 of the 91 missing cases
are Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs). The smaller sample will result in a downward bias, since
average haircuts are likely to be higher if these poorest countries were included.

ODA debt, which imply no stock cancellation, so that the available data on grace
periods and maturity extensions allow us to calculate case-specific haircuts.
 We apply the amortization schedule outlined in the Paris Club terms whenever
available (about 40% of all cases).33 Otherwise, a linear amortization schedule is
assumed, meaning that the principal is redeemed in equal amounts in each year
between the end of the grace period and maturity. Furthermore, we assume that
the rescheduling date equals the date when the Agreed Minutes were signed and
that the grace and maturity period start at the midpoint of the consolidation period.
The latter assumption is in line with the methodology of the secretariat of the Paris
Club, as argued by Martin and Vilanova (2001).
 Because of the lack of data, we ignore additional bilateral debt relief by creditor
governments that is sometimes provided on top of Paris Club agreements.34
33
Standardized repayment schedules are available for restructurings under London, Naples, Lyons,
and Cologne Terms as well as for a small number of recent restructurings under Classic Terms, such as
Gabon in 2000 or the Dominican Republic in 2005. These account for more than 40% of all Paris Club
restructurings. All of them have an increasing amortization schedule, as the fraction of the principal due
for repayment increases over time.
34
These cases of “top-up” relief have become more common over the past two decades, in particular,
during the HIPC Initiative when some governments granted debt relief beyond their commitments.

Figure 6 shows a plot of haircuts on official loans based on the risk-free CIRR discount
rate, while Figure 7 shows the same plot when using market-based rates. In both figures,
the circles represent the amount of restructured debt in real terms (inflation-adjusted
USD). Figure 8 shows the equivalent haircut plot for private debt restructurings (involving
foreign banks and bondholders) from Cruces and Trebesch (2013). In addition, Table C.5
in Appendix C shows haircut statistics for the full sample and across decades.
Our estimates depend strongly on the discount rate assumption. In general, haircuts
are lower when we use the CIRR as the discount rate instead of the market exit rates.
Specifically, the average Paris Club haircut is 59.9% with CIRR discounting and 78.6%
with market exit rates.35 This result is to be expected since the CIRR serves as a lower
bound on the range of possible discount rates, while market rates represent an upper
bound. However, the correlation between the resulting sets of estimates is very high,
with a correlation coefficient of 0.87.

Restructurings with private and official creditors: stylized facts

This section compares haircuts on private and official sovereign debt. The merged dataset
covers 601 restructurings in 97 countries over the years 1978 to 2015, including 414 Paris
Club restructurings, 165 restructurings of bank loans, and 22 restructurings of sovereign
bonds. As explained above, our Paris Club haircut estimates should be treated with
caution. In particular, the estimates are not ideally suited to drill into individual crisis
cases and compare haircuts on official and private debt for specific restructurings (such
as those in Argentina for the period 2001-2010). A rigorous case-by-case and countryby-country test of the Paris Club’s “comparability of treatment” principle would require
loan-level data on the terms of government-to-government debt and how each of the
loans is restructured (i.e., more transparency and better data provision by the Paris Club
and/or by government creditors). The main strength of the data we have assembled is
that it allows making the first aggregate comparison of the size and variation of haircuts
on official versus private debt. We take advantage of this strength to shed light on the
seniority structure of sovereign debt over the past 40 years.
We start with stylized facts on the occurrence and size of debt restructurings:
One instance is the resulting full cancellation of Afghan debt in 2010. Since these cases are not well
documented, our estimated haircuts for HIPC restructurings should be regarded as a lower bound.
35
The respective values are 52.9% for CIRR rates and 76.1% for market exit rates when using the
Libor instead of the ATB as the interest rate.

33

 There have been more than twice as many Paris Club restructurings (414) as re-

structurings with private creditors (187) since 1978. Figure 9 shows the frequency
of restructurings. In total, 88 different countries have implemented at least one
Paris Club deal, whereas private debt obligations were restructured with a total of
71 different countries.
 While debt restructurings with private creditors occur less frequently, they are
larger in terms of average debt amounts involved (see Figure C.1 in Appendix C).
The size difference owes to the fact that richer countries borrow more, and do so
mostly from private creditors. As a result, the average restructuring of bond and
bank debt is larger in absolute terms. However, once we scale by debtor country
GNI, the size of restructurings is similar, with the average Paris Club deal affecting
11.9% of GNI and the average private debt restructuring affecting 12.8% of GNI.
 The number of private and official debt restructurings within a country is correlated,
but there is considerable variation in the type of restructurings across countries.
Countries with a higher income per capita are more likely to implement private
debt restructurings, while countries with low income and no capital market access
are more likely to restructure with the Paris Club.
 Serial restructurings are a characteristic feature of sovereign debt markets. The
countries with the most restructurings include Senegal, which experienced 15 Paris
Club deals, while Poland featured 8 restructurings with commercial creditors.

Moreover, we can summarize the following facts on the relative size of credit losses (haircuts) during these restructurings:
 Average haircuts on official creditors are substantially higher than those on com-

mercial creditors. Panel (a) of Figure 10 compares the conservative Paris Club
haircuts (lower-bound estimates with CIRR discount rates) and the haircuts for
private creditors of Cruces and Trebesch (2013) (using market discount rates) over
all restructurings in our sample. The difference is more than 20 percentage points
on average, with Paris Club deals showing a mean haircut of 59.9%, compared to
40.4% and 40.5%, for bond and bank loan haircuts, respectively.
 The difference is even larger when we use the same discounting approach for both
official and private restructurings, as shown in panel (b) of Figure 10. The average
haircut for Paris Club deals then increases to 78.6%, again compared to 40% for
private creditors. These differences are very large and statistically significant.
 The average haircut size difference between official and private creditors is largest for

poor countries. Haircuts generally show a negative correlation with country income,

for both official and private creditors. But Figure 11 shows that haircuts by the
Paris Club are particularly high for lower- and low-income countries. The average
Paris Club haircut for low-income countries is 74.9% (using CIRR discounting),
compared to 58.8% for private debt restructurings in this income group.

Comparing haircuts: accounting for fundamentals and fixed effects

The descriptives above suggest that private creditors fare better than official creditors
during restructurings. However, these differences might reflect debtor country characteristics rather than creditor discrimination. In this section, we address this concern by
controlling for macroeconomic fundamentals and country and time fixed effects, which
could drive the observed differences in haircut size. For example, we know that many
countries restructuring with the Paris Club are poor and have no or limited access to
private capital markets. Also time effects might play a role, as debt relief operations such
as the HIPC Initiative resulted in dozens of high-haircut restructurings in the 1990s and
early 2000s.

We apply a standard OLS regression framework. Specifically, we pool the haircut estimates on private and official creditors (with CIRR discounting) and regress these on
dummy variables that capture the creditor type (private versus official) as well as a broad
range of controls. This approach is conceptually the same as our approach in Section 3,
where we include creditor dummies to study arrears in an OLS framework. The resulting
regression can be written as follows:
HCi,t,k = X i,t,k β + αP IP + ui,t,k ,

(9)

where HCi,t,k the haircut on creditor group k in a restructuring with country i at time
t, X i,t,k is a vector of controls, IP is an indicator variable for restructurings with private
creditors, and αP is the associated coefficient of interest. Paris Club restructurings are
the benchmark. The sign, significance, and size of αP indicate the ranking of creditors in
restructurings after controlling for fundamentals. The variables ui,t,k are standard errors
clustered at the country level.
As controls, we start with the same set of variables used in Section 3, with some changes to
account for the nature of restructurings as a onetime event. First, we replace the amount
of debt outstanding to each creditor group with a measure of debt restructured in each
deal (relative to total external debt). In addition, we use the three-year moving average
GDP growth rate prior to the restructuring instead of the contemporaneous and lagged
GDP growth. Furthermore, we construct dummies for wars, banking, and currency crises
that take the value of one in case a crisis or war occurred in the three years before a
restructuring. All other controls remain the same. As before, we start with this set of
basic controls and subsequently add time fixed effects as well as further control variables
with less data coverage. The latter are measures of trade and financial openness, the
debt composition of a country, variables related to liquidity needs, in particular, foreign
reserves and debt service, as well as further macroeconomic controls.
Table 3 shows our main results on correlates of haircuts. In columns 1-3, we use the
lower-bound estimates for the Paris Club haircuts (CIRR discounting), while columns
4-6 use market discount rates for Paris Club deals and thus the upper-bound estimates.
The full results, including the large set of control variables, are shown in Table C.6 in
Appendix C.
The main variable of interest is the dummy for private creditors. The results confirm
the descriptive findings. Haircuts on private debt tend to be significantly lower even
when controlling for country fundamentals and time effects. As before, the difference
is most pronounced when using the same discount rate for both Paris Club and private

Note: Columns 1-3 use lower-bound haircut estimates with the risk-free (CIRR) discount rate as the dependent
variable, and columns 4-6 use upper-bound haircut estimates with market rates. All regressions are estimated
with pooled OLS and include a set of basic controls. We subsequently add time fixed effects and a richer set of
controls. The variables are defined in Table C.2 in Appendix C and in the text. Clustered standard errors (at
the country level) are in parentheses. ∗ p < 0.1, ∗∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗∗ p < 0.01

deals (columns 4-6), but the result also holds when we use the lower-bound Paris Club
estimates. The size of the coefficients is large, with differences ranging between -5 and
-30 percentage points depending on the specification.
The results in columns 1 and 3 are robust to a number of checks and extensions. First,
we add time fixed effects. This does not change the overall picture, although the private
restructurings dummy shows a smaller coefficient, probably because bond restructurings
only occur after 1998 (the 1980s and 1990s were dominated by bank debt restructurings).
Second, we add additional controls, as discussed, with no major effects on the coefficient.
Standard errors increase slightly, mainly because the number of observations decreases
by almost one-fifth. We also estimated equation (9) with two separate dummies for bank
38

and bond restructurings instead of the more general “private restructurings” dummy. For
the case of market rates, both dummies are negative and significant at the 1% level in all
specifications. When using risk-free discount rates, the dummies are also negative and
statistically significant, but only in the first two specifications and not when adding the
full set of controls.
Furthermore, we check whether and how our main assumptions drive the results. In
particular, we use Libor instead of ATBs to compute debt service and make different assumptions on the debt type and restructuring choices for the Paris Club deals for which
this information is not known. Specifically, we assume that haircuts for all restructurings with partial debt stock cancellation equal the cancellation rate in the Paris Club
terms.36 In each case, the overall finding is little affected. Private creditors continue
to show significantly lower haircuts compared to official creditors, especially when using
market discount rates. Moreover, we exclude all restructurings associated with the HIPC
Initiative for both private and official creditors, in particular, to avoid double counting
associated with our assumption that there is no topping up. The results are again not
affected.
We also use alternative estimation procedures. First, we run fractional response models
to account for the fact that the dependent variable is a share that is bounded between
0 and 1. Second, we run a Tobit regression that allows us to simultaneously study the
restructuring choice (determinants of restructuring) and the size of the haircut in that
restructuring. Our main result is robust to the method applied. Finally, we differentiate
between final and intermediate restructurings since several countries implement multiple
restructurings within the same debt crisis spell (see Reinhart and Trebesch, 2016a, for
a discussion). Our main results are unaffected if we compare “final” restructurings only
(those not followed by another restructuring within four years).

4.5

Synthesis of debt restructurings and arrears

So far, we have analyzed the patterns of restructurings and arrears separately. We now
extend the analysis to provide a synthesis of these interrelated events. Specifically, we
investigate the patterns of arrears before and after restructurings of private and official
debt and how the behavior of arrears differs among them.
36

Since this cancellation rate applies to the net present value of the debt stock, we cannot apply it
directly to the haircut estimates.

39

Figure 12 shows arrears on private creditors as a fraction of GNI around events of private
debt restructurings, while Figure 13 shows the dynamics of arrears around official debt
restructurings with the Paris Club. Because some restructurings involve no arrears at all,
we only include episodes with an initial level of arrears exceeding 1% of GNI.37 We show
separate graphs using averages and quartiles, since the averages are strongly driven by
cases with heavy arrears.
Arrears on private debt exhibit a clear pattern. They are large pre-restructuring, with
an average of around 10% of GNI, but fall substantially to around 3% of GNI after the
restructuring is implemented. This drop is driven by countries with very high arrears, as
illustrated by the 75th percentile line in the right panel. In contrast, arrears on official
debt fall much less after a restructuring is implemented, with large amounts of arrears
remaining after the settlement. This finding further suggests that official creditors are
discriminated against when compared to private creditors.
37

Note that our dataset on arrears is from 1979 to 2007, which implies that the analysis excludes the
more recent restructurings. Specifically, we include 368 official and 165 private debt restructurings.

Conclusion

This paper analyzed the implicit seniority structure in sovereign debt markets using a
new dataset on the extent of missed payments (arrears) and the size of creditor losses
(haircuts) toward private and official creditors. We find a clear pecking order that is
robust to controlling for a range of country-specific variables: multilateral official creditors
and bondholders are senior lenders, whereas bilateral official creditors, banks, and trade
creditors are junior. The fact that bilateral official creditors tend to be junior to private
creditors, and that this ranking has become more pronounced over time, is surprising
given official creditors’ historical insistence on preferable treatment.
41

The results pose a challenge for the theoretical literature on sovereign debt, which has
typically ignored both the heterogeneity of sovereign debts as well as the heterogeneous
treatment of creditors in the event of default. Perhaps most importantly, by examining the
decisions of sovereigns to default and restructure debts differentially across creditors, our
findings can shed light on the fundamental question of sovereign debt: what, precisely,
are the costs of default to a sovereign country? Future research should explain the
discriminatory patterns documented here and thereby improve our understanding of the
specific incentives constraining borrowing and default.

Appendix A: Creditor seniority during S&P defaults
The existing empirical literature typically focuses on one particular type of sovereign default: that toward private banks and bondholders. This section matches our arrears data
across creditors with the widely used default indicator by Standard & Poor’s, which captures missed payments and/or restructuring events by sovereigns toward external banks
and bondholders. The measure strongly correlates with other main databases of sovereign
defaults on private creditors, such as Reinhart and Rogoff (2009), but it is not designed
to capture default toward official creditors (Reinhart and Trebesch, 2016a).
Figure A.1 shows the average arrears-to-debt ratio for each creditor group during S&P
default episodes compared to normal times. Arrears-to-debt ratios increase substantially
for each creditor group during default episodes, with the total AT D increasing from
4.9% in normal times to 10.7% during defaults. Unsurprisingly, the increase in arrears
is particularly large for those creditors for which S&P measures defaults: banks and
bondholders. Figure A.2 shows the same statistics for the RP IA, our preferred measure
of creditor seniority. In both figures, the pecking order is rather similar to our baseline
results.
The takeaway is that the seniority structure of sovereign debt that we have documented
remains intact even if we focus only on default episodes as defined by conventional measures. Moreover, the picture is consistent with the interpretation of the S&P dummy as
a measure of default toward private creditors.

Appendix B: Background on the Paris Club
The Paris Club is an informal forum of the most important official creditor countries
and was designed to deal with the payment difficulties of debtors. It first met in 1956.
Restructurings with the Paris Club became particularly relevant during the heyday of the
debt crises in the 1980s and 1990s. Since then, the number of agreements has declined. By
2015, the Paris Club had completed 433 debt relief agreements with 90 debtor countries,
thereby restructuring over 580 billion US dollars.
The restructuring approach of the Paris Club has evolved over time. In the 1980s, negotiations took place on a case-by-case basis and focused on short-term liquidity problems, mostly implementing maturity extensions without nominal debt reduction. During
the 1990s and 2000s, restructurings became increasingly standardized and increasingly
concessional, including debt stock cancellations to tackle problems of long-term debt
sustainability in low-income countries.
The Paris Club is guided by a number of so-called principles, in particular, those of
unanimity and equal burden sharing among its members. In addition, the comparability
of treatment clause requires countries to seek comparable debt relief from their bilateral
and private creditors.
A debtor country that wants to restructure its debts with the Paris Club has to demonstrate its inability to service its obligations and hence the need for debt relief. In addition, countries are expected to implement a structural adjustment program with the
IMF. Once these criteria are met, negotiations with the group of creditor countries take
place in Paris.38 These negotiations result in a final agreement on the broad terms of
restructurings - the “Agreed Minutes.”
The Agreed Minutes are based on general terms that have evolved over time toward
more comprehensive debt relief and concessional treatment, particularly for low-income
countries.39 These general terms can be distinguished as follows:
 Classic Terms were the standard terms applied to restructurings with debtor coun-

tries until the late 1980s. Negotiations were on a case-by-case basis, and the terms
applied to both official development aid (ODA) and market-related debt such as
38

In addition, several noncreditor representatives participate as observers, as do representatives from
various international organizations such as the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund.
39
Martin and Vilanova (2001), Gueye et al. (2007), and Cheng et al. (2016, 2017) provide a detailed
overview of the different terms.

50

export credits (non-ODA).40 The terms were modified in 2003 to provide more
comprehensive and flexible treatment of unsustainable debt levels in non-HIPCs
including the possibility of debt stock cancellations (“Evian Approach”).41
 Restructuring terms for highly indebted middle-income countries were enhanced in
the Houston Terms of 1990. These terms allow for a differential treatment of nonODA and ODA debt with a substantial extension of maturities and grace periods.
Yet, there is no debt stock cancellation.
 Restructuring terms for highly indebted low-income countries became increasingly
concessional over time. In particular, the possibility of a partial debt stock cancellation of non-ODA debt was gradually extended from 33% of the eligible debt in
1988 (Toronto Terms) to 50% in 1991 (London Terms) and 66% in 1994 (Naples
Terms). In the wake of the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative, cancellation rates increased further to 80% in 1996 (Lyons Terms) and 90% in 1999
(Cologne Terms). Finally, debt relief at completion point under the HIPC Initiative
is provided within the HIPC Exit Terms. All these terms allow for a differential
treatment of ODA and non-ODA debt and give countries two options for how debt
relief on non-ODA debt is delivered. In addition, maturity and grace periods are
substantially extended, particularly for ODA debt.
Our estimated haircuts for official creditors vary considerably over Paris Club terms
of agreement. Haircuts are in general lower for middle-income countries that reschedule under Classic Terms (average haircut of 40.4%) or Houston Terms (38.5%) than for
low-income countries. For the latter, haircuts increase as Paris Club terms become increasingly concessional. Specifically, average haircuts increase from 75.7% under Toronto
Terms to 85.3% under HIPC Exit Terms (not taking into account additional bilateral
debt relief).
The Agreed Minutes are not legally binding but serve as a benchmark for subsequent
bilateral negotiations. The resulting bilateral agreements are not publicly available. The
Agreed Minutes include guidelines for the agreed consolidation period, the cutoff date,
the total amount of debt relief including the restructured debt stock and potential cancellation, as well as the grace and maturity periods.

40

Specifically, the Classic Terms are defined as follows: “Credits (whether ODA or non-ODA) are
rescheduled at the appropriate market rate with a repayment profile negotiated on a case-by-case basis.”
41
Restructurings under the Evian Approach are also made on a case-by-case basis against the specific
background of the debtor. Hence, we do not differentiate between these two approaches within the set
of classic terms. Examples for the Evian Approach include Iraq (2004), Kenya (2004), Grenada (2006),
and the Seychelles (2009).

Note: Shown are unweighted means of country averages for the relative percentage in arrears (RPIA) in percent. The
definition of income groups (rows 2-4) is based on the classification of the World Bank and described in Figure 3 of the
main text. Regions (rows 5-10) and lending categories (rows 11-13) also follow the definition of the World Bank as of
2015. Political regimes (rows 14-16) are based on the Polity II index, which ranks countries from -9 to +9. Countries are
defined as democracies (autocracies) if they have a score above 3 (below -3).

Note: The table shows the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition for the mean difference in RPIAs across creditor
groups. The mean difference is listed in the first column. The second and third columns show the part of the
difference that is fundamentally justified and the part of the difference that is unexplained and thus reflects active
creditor discrimination. The last column states the fraction of the mean difference that reflects discrimination in
percent. Note that mean differences vary from the sample statistics because of data availability with respect to the
explanatory variables.
