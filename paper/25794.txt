Do Distressed Banks Really Gamble for Resurrection?

ABSTRACT
We explore the actions of financially distressed banks in two distinct periods that include
financial crises (1985-1994, 2005-2014) and differ in bank regulations, especially concerning
capital requirements and enforcement. In contrast to the widespread belief that distressed banks
gamble for resurrection, we document that distressed banks take actions to reduce leverage and
risk, such as reducing asset and loan growth, issuing equity, decreasing dividends, and lowering
deposit rates. Despite large differences in regulation between periods, the extent of deleveraging
is similar, suggesting that economic forces beyond formal regulations incentivize bank managers
to deleverage when their banks are in distress.

1. Introduction
Many financial economists take the view that distressed banks have strong incentives to
gamble for resurrection by taking risks they would not otherwise take and to refrain from
deleveraging. For instance, Freixas, Rochet, and Parigi (2004) write that “We take into account
two well-acknowledged facts of the banking industry: first, that it is difficult to disentangle
liquidity shocks from solvency shocks, second, that moral hazard and gambling for resurrection
are typical behaviors of banks experiencing financial distress.” With this view, the shareholders
gain if the risks pay off and if the risks fail the bill is paid by the bondholders and the taxpayers.
A related view is that deleveraging by banks benefits the liability holders and hurts the
shareholders, so that shareholders try to avoid it (Admati (2014)). An alternative view is that there
are many forces that push shareholders of distressed banks to lower their risk and leverage to
reduce distress costs. These forces include, for instance, managerial reputation, managerial riskaversion, threat of runs, bond covenants, preservation of franchise value, and regulatory
interventions.
In this study, we focus on two turbulent periods in the U.S. banking system, the late 1980s and
late 2000s, in which hundreds of banks faced financial distress, and explore in a systematic fashion
whether the behavior of distressed banks is consistent with gambling for resurrection or
deleveraging. Surprisingly, there is little existing evidence on the issues we address despite their
importance. The studies that exist do not reach a consensus regarding gambling for resurrection.
Our main finding is that despite regulatory differences between the two periods, banks took actions
to reduce their asset risk and leverage, rather than gamble for resurrection, in both periods.
Banks do not make the choice to gamble for resurrection or deleverage in the abstract.
Regulations limit their room to manoeuver. For the first period we consider, banks did not have

2

formal capital requirements of the type we are now familiar with, as the Basel Accord was
concluded in 1989 and implemented in the 1990s in the U.S. Further, as a result of concerns about
moral hazard following the savings and loans crisis, the U.S. tightened regulations substantially.
FDICIA, adopted in 1991, introduced prompt corrective action (PCA) which was designed to
resolve banks before they could engage in actions detrimental to the deposit insurance fund (DIF).
These substantial differences in regulation arose partly because of the intent to reduce risk taking
by banks that could hurt the financial system or the DIF. It is therefore interesting that we find
little evidence of changes in the behavior of distressed banks.
Our study has four parts. First, we propose two empirical indicators for bank distress and test
their usefulness in forecasting bank failure. These indicators are a low equity capital ratio and a
low Z-score. Banks with low equity capital ratio are those in the bottom decile of the equity-toassets distribution. Banks with low Z-scores are those who are in the bottom decile of a distanceto-default measure (based on banks’ earnings). We show that these variables are good predictors
of future bank failure, and that their intersection is even a better predictor. A bank that is in the
lowest decile of the distribution of equity capital ratio and in the lowest decile of Z-score is about
17.8% and 19.3% more likely to fail within three years during both periods, respectively (relative
to an unconditional base rate of 2.0% and 1.7%, respectively).1 The probability of failure is even
stronger when distress happens during a crisis (19.4% and 22.7%, respectively). For the rest of the
analysis, we use the joint observation of a low equity capital ratio and a low Z-score as the main
indicator for bank distress.

1
This is based on estimated likelihood of failure within 3 years for each of the two periods, all else equal. The base
rate represents the mean failure rate for each of the two panels.

3

In the second part, we explore the dynamic behavior of distressed banks. Looking a year out
following a quarter when a bank is financially distressed, we document that distressed banks
increase their equity capital ratio by about 0.80% and 0.55% during the late 1980s and late 2000s,
respectively. This is an economically significant increase in equity capital which amounts to 54%
and 30% of the standard deviation of annual equity capital changes in the respective periods.
During the GFC, however, the response of distressed banks is weaker by about a half. It is plausible
that not being eligible for TARP made it difficult for a bank to raise equity. We examine whether
the government’s 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) is associated with the distressed
banks’ recapitalization, and indeed we find that distressed banks that received TARP funds
increased their equity capital ratio by an additional 55 basis points.
In the third part, we shift the focus to the financial statements of banks and examine how
different balance sheet items change following distress. We show that deleveraging occurs through
actions taken across the entire balance sheet. Specifically, we document that banks in financial
distress shrink their assets (e.g., reduce the asset base, close branches, cut the employee
workforce), reduce their liabilities (e.g., shrink deposits, reduce deposit rates), and increase their
equity capital (e.g., add equity capital, cut dividends). Outside the crisis period, the behavior of
distressed banks is similar between the two periods that we examine. However, while during the
Savings and Loan (S&L) crisis there is no difference in bank deleveraging during and outside the
crisis, during the GFC distressed banks deleveraged to a lesser degree than they did in the
surrounding years. The primary reason for this is the lower propensity of distressed banks to raise
new equity during the crisis period. Dewatripont and Tirole (2012) explicitly discuss how
regulation could prevent “banks in trouble from ‘gambling for resurrection’ by raising interest
rates on deposits and attracting funds from depositors who ‘count’ on implicit or explicit support

4

from the authorities”. We find that this behavior is not typical of banks in distress. In fact, none of
our results is consistent with a gambling for resurrection strategy, which requires a bank to make
risky bets when insolvent or near insolvent. A possible reason for why our data is not supportive
of the gambling for resurrection hypothesis could be that regulation plays the role discussed by
Dewatripont and Tirole (2012).
In the fourth and final part of the study, we examine how banks’ risk indicators evolve
following a quarter where they are in financial distress. We find that a variety of risk measures
show a decline in risk in the year following distress: banks’ distance-to-default increases, the nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio decreases, earnings volatility decreases, and risk-weighted assets
decline. Again, banks’ behavior is consistent across the periods that we examine.
Overall, our findings indicate that, contrary to the widespread belief that distressed banks
gamble for resurrection, they actually deleverage on average. Our results are broadly consistent
across the two periods (late 1980s and late 2000s). Because the regulatory environments changed
dramatically between these periods, it is possible to conclude that economic forces besides
regulation incentivize bank managers to deleverage when banks are in distress.
Our paper contributes to several strands of the literature. First, we contribute to the literature
on risk-taking and deleveraging by banks in distress. The literature on risk-taking by banks has
paid much attention to the relation between charter value and risk-taking (e.g., Keeley, 1990;
Demsetz, Saidenberg, and Strahan, 1996) as well as to the relation between various dimensions of
governance, including ownership concentration, and risk-taking (e.g., Demsetz, Saidenberg, and
Strahan, 1997; Laeven and Levine, 2009). However, there is little evidence on the risk-taking
choices of banks in distress and, especially, whether these banks take steps to deleverage. Despite
the importance of these issues for understanding the incentives and operations of banks, the

5

empirical literature is thin and existing results are mixed. For example, Bidder, Krainer, and
Shapiro (2017) find that banks that faced losses in the oil crisis of 2014 took steps to deleverage
their balance sheets. In contrast, Koudstaal and van Wijnbergen (2012) find that “Banks whose
share price has slumped tend to gamble for resurrection by increasing the riskiness of their asset
portfolios.” Baldursson and Portes (2013) document that banks in Iceland refinanced loans to their
owners and other big borrowers following the financial turmoil of August 2007, consistent with
gambling for resurrection behavior. Bonaccorsi di Patti and Kashyap (2017) analyze the fate of
Italian banks that exhibit large drops in profitability and find that about one third of the banks
recover. They find that the banks that recover are those that do not gamble for resurrection but
instead cut credit to their riskiest borrowers. Acharya, Gujral, Kulkani, and Shin (2011) argue that
banks redistributed wealth away from creditors to shareholders with dividend payments during the
crisis. Lastly, within the financial industry but outside banking, Kirti (2017) investigates risktaking by insurance companies hit hard by the crisis and finds that they reduce risk.
Second, we contribute to the corporate finance literature on the behavior of firms in distress.
The views in this literature are mixed. Many authors present models of firm distress in which firms
gamble for resurrection (e.g., White, 1989; Rose-Ackerman, 1991; Adler, 1995; Eberhart and
Senbet, 1993; Akerlof and Romer, 1993; Downs and Rocke, 1994; Colonnello, Curatola, and
Hoang, 2017). Admati, DeMarzo, Hellwig, and Pfleiderer (2018) develop a model where, with
debt in place, shareholders resist leverage decreases and, if forced to deleverage, would rather use
asset sales. Their theory follows from the fact that, everything else equal, a decrease in leverage
benefits existing debtholders. They conclude that resistance to deleveraging is especially strong
for firms in distress. The empirical evidence, however, is inconsistent with the theory, i.e., there is
little evidence that corporations indeed gamble for resurrection or voluntarily choose to issue more

6

debt when their leverage is already excessive. DeAngelo, Gonçalves, and Stulz (2018) document
that following an episode of peak leverage firms deleverage sharply, so that after five or six years
their leverage is typically quite low.
Third, we provide evidence on the predictions of the theoretical literature on risk-taking by
banks in distress (e.g., Kane, 1989; Corbett and Mitchell, 2000; Holmström and Tirole, 2000;
Morrison and White, 2013; Boyd and Hakenes, 2014; Bruche and Llobet, 2014). Rochet (1992)
and Hellmann, Murdock, and Stiglitz (2000) propose a theory arguing that more stringent capital
requirements reduce banks’ tendency to gamble for resurrection.
Fourth, we contribute to the literature on the impact of regulatory changes in affecting banks’
risk-taking. The second period we look at is one when FDICIA was fully in effect. FDICIA was
adopted in part to prevent banks from gambling for resurrection by introducing early intervention
(Benston and Kaufman, 1997). Existing empirical evidence finds that poorly capitalized banks
experienced a reduction in risk following FDICIA (Akhigbe and Whyte, 2001). Despite these
changes, our paper shows that distressed banks behave similarly under the pre-FDICIA and the
post-FDICIA regimes. Furthermore, Laeven and Levine (2009) conduct a cross-country study of
bank behavior and regulatory environment and find that the regulatory environment shapes banks’
risk taking behavior. In contrast, our study does not find a material difference in the behavior of
distressed banks across different regulatory regimes within the U.S.
The study proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data used in the study, and introduces
the variables that measure bank distress. In Section 3, we explore the variables that are best at
predicting bank failure, and therefore are best suited to measure bank distress. In Section 4, we
test whether distressed banks reduce their leverage. In Section 5, we analyze the balance sheet

7

dynamics of distressed banks. Section 6 analyzes the evidence for whether distressed banks
increase risk taking activities. Section 7 concludes.

2. Data and Variables
2.1. Data Sources
Our analysis is based on the Reports of Condition and Income, i.e., Call Reports. The Call
Report data comprise an exhaustive set of mandatory filings by banks at a quarterly frequency. We
include all the reporting commercial banks in our sample during two distinct periods: 1985-1994
and 2005-2014. These two periods include the two most recent banking crises to impact the U.S.
banking system, i.e., the S&L crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s and the Global Financial
Crisis (GFC) during 2008-2010. Our analysis is based on two separate unbalanced panels over
these two distinct periods. The 1985-1994 and 2005-2014 panels contain 15,915 and 8,131 unique
banks corresponding to over 480,000 and over 260,000 bank-quarter observations, respectively.
As part of the analysis, we contrast bank behavior in normal times and crisis times. To construct
an indicator of crisis periods, we plot the number of failed banks from 1980 to 2015 in Figure 1.
The figure shows that during this period there are two waves of bank failures. We define our crisis
variable as an indicator variable for the years 1988-1990 and 2009-2011. During these years, the
largest number of banks failed in the respective periods we consider.2
We also use numerous financial and non-financial controls, including proxies for liquidity
(core deposit ratio and loan to asset ratio), size (log assets), too-big-to-fail indicator (assets of $50
billion or more in 2010 dollars), multi-bank holding company affiliation, bank age (chartered

within prior 5 years), and metro location. Our tests further include logged per-capita income and
the unemployment rate as well as state indicator variables.3

2.2. Descriptive Statistics
Table 1 presents summary statistics for the variables used in our analyses. Panels A and B
depict statistics for the 1985-1994 and 2005-2014 periods, respectively. Panels C and D show
correlation tables for the two periods. Panels E and F compare key variables between distressed
banks and non-distressed banks for the two periods (further discussed in Section 3). Panel G shows
a correlation table for the different measures of bank financial distress. All variables are defined
more precisely in Appendix A.
Panels A and B show that 0.5%, 1.3%, and 2.0% of banks fail within 1, 2, and 3 years
respectively in the 1985-1994 period and 0.4%, 1.1%, and 1.7% in the 2005-2014 period; thus,
unconditional failure probabilities are roughly similar. Because the Basel capital requirements are
not in effect during almost all of our first period, we have to use a different measure of
capitalization than the commonly used Tier 1 ratio. We use the Equity capital ratio, which we
define as equity over assets, where equity is the bank’s book equity. It is known from the literature
that common shareholder equity is a better predictor of a bank’s returns during the GFC than the
more common risk-weighted measures (Demirguc-Kunt, Detragiache, and Merrouche, 2012).
Further, stress tests in 2009 placed considerable emphasis on book equity. The median Equity
capital ratio in the overall sample is 8.3% during the earlier period and it increases by 0.7 basis
points per year; the corresponding numbers for the 2005-2014 period are 10.1% and 5.1 basis

3

These indicators are based on the state where the charter is located; the overwhelming majority of banks operate in
a single state.

9

points. Thus the median bank increases capital in both periods but capital is substantially higher
in the latter period, which is to be expected (see discussion in Flannery and Rangan, 2008, about
banks increasing their equity capital ratios in the 1990s).
Our other key risk measure is the bank Z-score (Demsetz and Strahan, 1997).4 A higher bank
Z-score means that a bank is safer. This variable is often interpreted as a proxy for distance-todefault and is a commonly used measure to proxy for bank risk.5 We measure Z-score as the mean
across four quarters of the return-on-assets (ROA) plus the equity capital ratio divided by the
standard deviation of ROA.6 The idea behind this definition is that this distress proxy measures
the depth of a bank’s equity capital, i.e., how many standard deviations of ROA losses would it
take to exhaust the equity capital. The Z-score has a median of 93.2 and 160.5 in the two periods
respectively. On average, banks are therefore less at risk of distress in the more recent period we
consider.
In terms of asset growth, we observe log assets to grow on average (and median) overall and
for loans for both periods, but the median fixed assets decline somewhat. Deposits also tend to
grow during both periods, whereas the median non-deposit liabilities decline in the latter period.
All of these variables show substantial variation in their distribution; for example the range of log
loan growth ranges from the 1st to the 99th percentile is -0.35 to 0.23 for the first period and -0.28
to 0.20 for the second period. Other control variables summarized in Panels A and B also exhibit
substantial variation.

4

Our Z-scores are estimated using quarterly ROA rather than annualized quarterly ROA; the means and medians are
therefore higher as a result. But the two measures are highly correlated (over 98%) and our inferences do not change
depending on which version we use.
5
See Boyd and Runkle (1993), Laeven and Levine (2009), and Berger, El Ghoul, Guedhami, and Roman (2013).
6
We use four quarters of data in computing the standard deviation of ROA.

10

Panels C and D document that the bivariate correlations of our explanatory variables are
generally low. One exception is the correlation between debt/liabilities and log assets which is 49% in the earlier period and -37% in the later period.

3. Measuring Bank Distress: Which Factors Predict Bank Failure?
A key component of our analysis is identifying banks that are in distress. To do so, we use two
(imperfect) commonly-used proxies to categorize the level of financial distress: the Equity capital
ratio and the Z-score. Both measures rely on data that is available for all banks during both periods.
The equity capital ratio is a measure of bank solvency used by academics, investors, and regulators.
For example, Berger and Bouwman (2013) argue that higher capital buffers help banks survive
during financial crises and are even more important for smaller banks that are less able to absorb
external shocks. We define distressed banks as those with Equity capital ratio in the bottom decile
of the distribution for that period (Low equity capital ratio indicator).7 The 10th percentile cutoff
for Equity capital ratio is 6.06% in the earlier period and 7.66% in the latter period.
Our second measure of distress is the bank Z-score, which captures the ability of earnings and
capital levels to serve as a buffer. For our analysis, we transform this variable to percentiles within
each observation period and define the Low Z-score indicator to denote whether the bank is in the
bottom decile of the Z-score distribution in the observation period. The 10th percentile cutoff for
Z-score is 18.3 in the earlier period and 31.6 in the latter period.
We also consider a third proxy for distress, which we label Financial distress. The banks
flagged as in Financial distress during a period are the banks that are both in the bottom decile of

7

We reach similar conclusions if we use the 5th percentile or the 15th percentile.

11

the Equity capital ratio distribution and the bottom decile of the Z-score distribution during that
period. The sample of banks that are flagged as in Financial distress includes about 3.8% of the
bank-quarters in the period 1985-1994 and about 2.7% of the bank-quarters in the period 20052014.
Table 1, Panels E and F, compare the Equity capital ratio and Z-score for banks that are
classified as distressed by each of the three indicators that we use, for each of the periods.
Naturally, flagging banks as distressed based on whether they are in the 1st decile of the Equity
capital ratio it creates is a sharp difference in the Equity capital ratio between the distressed and
non-distressed banks, but the difference in the Z-score between the two types of banks is weak. In
a similar fashion, flagging the 1st decile of the Z-score results in a sharp difference in Z-score, and
muted difference in the Equity capital ratio. The reason is that the correlation between the two
variables is relatively low as it is 0.23 for the first period and 0.35 for the second (Panel G). The
Financial distress variable, which is the interaction between the first two indicators, flags between
3.1% and 4.1% of bank-months observations, and captures the extreme tails of both the Equity
capital ratio and the Z-score.
In Figure 2 we summarize the fraction of distressed banks by year for each of the two time
periods using all three distress indicators. The results suggest in each period that the proportion of
banks with Low equity capital ratio is somewhat higher prior to the peak crisis period (1988-1990)
and (2008-2010). Such an outcome may reflect that banks try to boost their capital during the
crisis, perhaps because the market demands it, but part of the explanation may also be that banks
whose capital falls sharply during the crisis do not stay in the sample. We discuss this sample
selection issue in Section 4. The fraction of banks with Low Z-score falls throughout most of the
first period but has an inverted U-shape in the second period, peaking in the first quarter of 2010.

12

The fraction of banks that have both a Low Z-score and Low equity capital ratio evolves similarly
to the fraction of banks with Low equity capital ratio in the first period and to the fraction of banks
with a Low Z-score in the second period.
As we would expect if our proxies for financial distress are useful for capturing banks in
financial distress, the banks in our distressed bank samples differ substantially from the healthier
banks. Panels E and F of Table 1 show how our key variables of interest differ between distressed
and non-distressed banks. We find that distressed banks have lower growth of assets as well as of
liabilities. Depending on the measure of distress, distressed banks are larger or smaller than nondistressed banks. Banks with assets greater than $50bn are equally likely to be distressed in 19851994 but more likely to be distressed in 2005-2014. The ratio of loans to assets is generally higher
for distressed banks across distress measures. Distressed banks are more likely to be headquartered
in metro areas and to be relatively young in age.
We would expect financially distressed banks to be more likely to fail than non-distressed
banks if our measures distinguish between distressed banks and other banks. We test whether the
banks we consider to be financially distressed are more likely to fail. We adopt the FDIC definition
of bank failure, which is a situation where a bank is unable to meet its obligations and is either
taken over by the FDIC or acquired by another bank (according to the FDIC failed bank list).8 Our
dataset for this analysis is at the quarterly level; thus, each observation represents a bank in a
specific quarter. The dependent variable is an indicator variable for whether the bank fails in future
quarters (4, 8, 12 future quarters). The explanatory variables include Low equity capital ratio, Low
Z-score, or Financial distress, bank characteristics, and fixed effects for state headquarters and

8

13

calendar quarter. Bank characteristics (X1) include logged assets, assets greater than $50 Billion,
an indicator whether the bank is part of a multibank holding company, the ratio of deposits-toliabilities, the ratio of loans-to-assets, the ratio of core deposits-to-total deposits, an indicator
whether the bank is headquartered in a metro area, an indicator whether the bank is less than 5
years old, and state-year level variables: logged per-capital income and the unemployment rate.
Table 2 reports estimates of the following model:

Failure within K Quarters = f1(D, X1, Quarter FE, State FE)

(1)

where D is the distress indicator, X1 represents the vector of controls, and FE denotes fixed effects.
The regressions show that banks with Low equity capital ratio (Panel A) and banks with Low
Z-score (Panel B) are more likely to fail. Focusing on the three-year horizon (Columns (3) and (6)
in Panel A), banks with Low equity capital ratio are 8.7% and 6.3% more likely to default in the
next 3 years for the first period and the second period, respectively. A bank with a Low Z-score
indicator has a higher likelihood of failure within three years of 9.4% and 7.6% for the first and
second period, respectively.
Next, we examine the predictive power of Financial distress, which is the interaction of Low
equity capital ratio and Low Z-score. We repeat the regressions with this variable; the results are
presented in Panel C of Table 2. Banks that are in the intersection of the deciles have a higher
likelihood of failure by 17.8% and 19.3% for the two periods, respectively. This is a particularly
large magnitude as it is roughly ten times the unconditional mean of bank failure of 2.0% in the
first period and 1.7% in the second period. We also note a material increase in the R2 of the
regressions in Panel C, relative to those in Panels A and B. In Internet Appendix Table A1, we

14

provide robustness analysis in which we include the Crisis interaction. Crisis is an indicator of the
crisis period of 1988-1990 or 2008-2010 depending on the sample period. The results show that
our three proxies for financial distress perform even better during a crisis period.
Among our three proxies for financial distress, the proxy that classifies as distressed banks that
are both in the lowest decile of the Equity capital ratio and of the Z-score distributions is the best
predictor of bank failure. This is consistent with Panels E and F of Table 1, discussed earlier, which
compare the means of key variables for distressed banks and non-distressed banks. The statistics
in these panels show that the greatest difference in characteristics and behavior occur when using
banks in the Financial distress sample. There is also economic intuition for why financial
distressed banks that are both in the lowest decile of the Equity capital ratio and the lowest decile
of the Z-score are more likely to fail than banks that satisfy only one of the criteria. While the
Equity capital ratio measures the leverage of the bank, banks differ in their asset composition and
specifically in their volatility. A higher leverage would correspond to a higher probability of
distress for a bank with volatile assets compared to a bank with more stable assets. Z-score
measures the bank’s earnings scaled by the volatility of earnings, and thus controls for the volatility
of earnings, which is related to the riskiness of assets. In terms of the controls, we note expected
signs for some key coefficients. Banks with higher loan growth and lower core deposits are more
likely to fail. There is no consistent link between the other controls across periods and failure with
the exception of the local economic condition variables. These variables suggest higher
unemployment and lower per-capita income are generally associated with higher risk of failure.
In conclusion, banks in the bottom deciles of the Equity capital ratio distribution or the Z-score
distribution are more likely to fail, but the financial distress classification that requires banks to be
in the bottom deciles of the distributions of both ratios results in a materially stronger predictor of

15

failure and thus a better proxy for bank distress than each of the variables alone. For the rest of the
analysis, we consider a bank to be in financial distress if both its Equity capital ratio and its Zscore are in the bottom deciles of their respective distributions. In the main body of the study we
present analyses solely using the Financial distress indicator, and the corresponding analyses using
Low Equity capital ratio and Low Z-score are provided in the Internet Appendix.

4. Do Banks Deleverage?
In this section, we assess whether banks deleverage after they have reached a state of financial
distress. Everything else equal, deleveraging is inconsistent with the gambling for resurrection
hypothesis. To test whether distressed banks deleverage, we measure the change in the Equity
capital ratio four quarters ahead and regress it on the Financial distress indicator and controls.
Our analysis is based on the following model where D denotes our distress indicator, Crisis is a
crisis period indicator, and X2 denotes the controls:

Equity capital ratio (q, q+4) = f2(D, D*Crisis, X2, Quarter FE, State FE)

(2)

The estimated regressions are presented in Table 3. In addition to the distress variables, control
variables, and fixed effects, we add a crisis-period interaction in all regressions (Crisis). Further,
in Columns (5) and (6) we also add a TARP indicator variable for the 2005-2014 period for whether
a bank received a TARP infusion within the prior year. In some of the specifications, we add a
lagged version of the dependent variable to control for autocorrelation in the dependent variable.
Also, we use Driscroll-Kray standard errors for results reported in Tables 3 to 5 as in Fahlenbrach,
Prilmeier, and Stulz (2017) to deal with potential biases resulting from overlapping data.

The results in Table 3 show that, on average, distressed banks increase their equity capital ratio
significantly by about 0.8 percentage points (relative to an average of 8.9 percentage points in
1985-1994 and 10.8 percentage points in 2005-2014). This is a very large increase in the equity
capital ratio as it represents about 55% of a standard deviation of the changes in the Equity capital
ratio in the first period (=0.8/1.46), and 44% of the standard deviation in the second period
(=0.8/1.83).
Table 3 shows that the increase in the equity capital ratio is dampened during the GFC but not
during the S&L crisis. During the GFC, the increase in the capital ratio is reduced by roughly half
as it is lower by 0.5 percentage points. The slower increase in the capital ratio during the GFC is
surprising, since at least some of the distressed banks received TARP infusions. Using the TARP
indicator, we find that the TARP infusions offset the dampening of the increase in the equity capital
ratio due to the GFC. In other words, TARP-supported distressed banks increased their equity
capital ratio by 0.8 percentage points during the recent crisis, relative to non-TARP banks which
increased their capital ratio only by about 0.3 percentage points. The results are robust to the
inclusion of the lagged dependent variable (Columns (2), (4), and (6)); the positive association of
lagged capital changes with current capital changes suggests, as we would expect, that banks
gradually build up capital. Further research is required to understand better why the equity capital
ratio did not increase for non-TARP banks. It could well be that TARP banks were viewed as
banks that the official sector wanted to keep alive, so that banks that did not receive TARP found
it more difficult to raise equity (see further discussion in Section 5).
We conduct several robustness tests for these results. In Internet Appendix Table A2, we
replace the Financial distress indicator with its components (Low equity capital ratio in Panel A,
and Low Z-score in Panel B). The statistical significance is high when using the Low equity capital

17

ratio, and weaker when the Low Z-score is used. We also present a set of results excluding the
Crisis interaction (Panels C, D, and E). Again, the results remain statistically and economically
significant.
Banks can fail during the year following the quarter when they are recorded as distressed banks.
A concern is that bank failure could mechanically generate the deleveraging result, since the banks
that survive necessarily perform better than the ones that fail. DeAngelo, Goncalves, and Stulz
(2018) conduct an analysis of deleveraging for public non-financial firms and find that a
substantial fraction of firms are delisted at or shortly after reaching peak leverage. These firms
obviously cannot have had time to deleverage. If the same patterns were to hold for our sample,
the deleveraging behavior we observe would be the behavior of the banks that survived and not
that of the average distressed bank. To test whether attrition accounts for the results we have over
a four-quarter horizon, we shorten the horizon to one quarter and rerun the analysis (presented in
Internet Appendix Table A2, Panels F, G, and H). The results are noisier but the magnitude of
deleveraging is consistent with what we find for four quarters (the one-quarter results need to be
multiplied by four). Hence, we conclude that the impact of the survival bias on our results is
extremely limited.
As discussed, regulations differ in the second period from the first period. An important
difference is that FDCIA applies throughout our second period. With FDICIA, banks that have
low capital ratios are constrained in the actions they can take. For instance, banks that are
undercapitalized cannot have brokered deposits and cannot pay dividends. They have to have in
place a capital restoration plan. Hence, it could be that our results are driven by the banks for which
prompt corrective action applies, i.e., the banks for which these restrictions apply. To examine this
possibility, we re-estimate Table 3 eliminating the banks that are constrained by FDCIA and

18

present the results in Internet Appendix Table A2, Panel I. Our inferences are unaffected when we
eliminate these banks, so that our results are not driven by banks subjected to prompt corrective
action.

5. How Do Banks Deleverage?
In this section, we investigate how banks deleverage. In particular, we wish to understand
whether banks deleverage by taking different actions: by selling assets and using proceeds to
reduce liabilities, by raising new equity directly, or through retention that is accelerated by
dividend reductions. More specifically, a bank could sell assets, whether financial or physical, and
use the proceeds to pay back debt, so that its leverage would fall. DeAngelo, Gonçalves, and Stulz
(2018) show that an important tool for deleveraging is retention of earnings, so that banks could
deleverage by reducing their payouts. Further, banks could attempt to increase earnings by taking
steps to reduce expenses. In practice, we consider how assets, loans, and fixed-assets change for
distressed banks. We also investigate how liabilities evolve, because holding everything else
constant, decreases in liabilities correspond to a decrease in leverage. We consider the changes in
deposit and non-deposit liabilities. We consider how the number of employees evolves for
distressed banks as well as how their cost of deposits evolves. Finally, we investigate changes in
equity and changes in dividends.
For our regression analysis, we estimate regressions that are the same as the ones estimated in
Table 3, except the dependent variables are outcome variables for banks that we consider to be
helpful in assessing how banks deleverage. In the following regression, D denotes our distress
indicator, Crisis is a crisis period indicator, and X3 denotes the controls:

19

Balance Sheet Item (q, q+4) = f 3(D, D*Crisis, X3, Quarter FE, State FE)

(3)

We present the results of the analysis in Table 4 Panels A and B for periods 1985-1994 and
2005-2014, respectively. We find that distressed banks reduce both financial and physical assets.
They reduce total assets, loans, and fixed assets. They also reduce the number of branches. It is
then not surprising that employment shrinks as well. The magnitudes of the effects are large. In
the first period we consider, distressed banks decrease the size of their total assets by 8.2%, their
loan portfolio by 8.7%, their fixed assets by 6.6%, the number of their branches by 3.5%, and the
number of their employees by 7.0%. The magnitudes are similar in the later period. The decreases
are even larger during the GFC. During the recent crisis, distressed banks reduce the size of their
total assets by 11.2%, their loan portfolio by 9.3%, their fixed assets by 8.0%, the number of their
branches by 5.8%, and the number of their employees by 7.3%.
Turning to the liabilities, Table 4, Panel A, Columns (6) to (9) show that banks deleverage by
reducing their liabilities: both deposits and other liabilities decline. We would expect banks
gambling for resurrection to attract more deposits through a higher rate, so that they can take more
risks and increase their leverage. As Benston and Kaufman (1997) discuss for the pre-FDICIA
period, “zombie” S&Ls “were making profitability difficult for solvent institutions by paying
higher-than-market interest rates to attract deposits and charging lower-than-market rates on their
loans, in a strategy of gambling the company.” Instead, in the period of 1985-1994 distressed banks
reduce their deposit rates by 0.026% (Panel A, Column (7)) and the quantity of deposits by 9.2%
(Panel A, Column (8)). The magnitudes for the later period, 2005-2014, are almost identical, with
the exception that the decline in the quantity of deposits during the crisis is steeper by an additional
3.4%. This evidence is consistent with Ben-David, Palvia, and Spatt (2017) who find that deposit

20

rates do not materially vary with equity capital ratio. Instead, they document that banks use
deposits as a tool to fund loan growth: they increase offered deposit rates to attract new deposits
when the demand for loans is high. Thus, when distressed banks do not seek to make new loans,
they also do not act to attract new deposits. Table 4, Column (8) show that other liabilities (e.g.,
long term debt) of distressed banks decline by about 19.2% and 20.9%, per year, in the two
respective periods that we study. It is important to note that the decrease in interest rates on deposits
is not due to economy-wide movements in interest rates. We control for such movements through
the use of quarter fixed effects, so that all our results have to interpreted as showing how distressed
banks differ in their behavior from non-distressed banks within a quarter.
Lastly, we find that banks increase their equity capital through two channels: equity issuance
and retention. If banks intended to gamble for resurrection, then banks would want to pay out funds
to existing shareholders, which would make them riskier and increase shareholder wealth in case
of bank failure. Table 4, Panel A, Columns (10) and (11) show results that are inconsistent with
this assertion. Specifically, they show that, on average, common stock increases by 1.7% and by
2.7%, and dividends are cut by 26.1% and 30.2%, in the two periods, respectively. These results
are consistent with the findings of Dinger and Vallascas (2016), who document that, among
publicly-traded banks, the likelihood of equity issuance is higher when the bank is poorly
capitalized. However, while equity does not increase less during the S&L crisis, it does increase
less during the GFC. Acharya, Gujral, Kulkani, and Shin (2011) argue that banks by paying large
amounts in dividends during the crisis redistributed wealth away from creditors to shareholders.
The distressed banks in our sample reduced dividend payments during the GFC.
Analyzing the deleveraging of distressed banks during the GFC reveals that banks deleveraged
less because they issued less equity during the crisis. Table 3 shows that banks increased their

21

Equity capital ratio following distress quarters, however, did less so during GFC. In an apparent
contrast, Table 4, Panel B, shows that both assets and liabilities of distressed banks shrank more
during the GFC than outside of it. In fact, the two results are consistent with each other. Distressed
banks deleveraged less during the GFC relative to distress banks outside the crisis because of two
reasons. First, distressed banks during the GFC reduced their liabilities by a smaller amount
relative to the extent that they reduced their assets. To see this, compare the coefficients on the
Crisis interaction in Column (1) to that in Column (6). Second, while distressed banks outside
crisis periods deleverage themselves through equity issuance (Column (10)), distressed banks
during the GFC did not issue equity. In fact, the coefficient on the Crisis interaction in Column
(10) nullifies the coefficient on the Financial distress indicator.
A plausible explanation for the lower equity raising during the crisis is that banks eligible for
TARP funds were banks that the government wanted to survive, so that distressed banks that did
not receive TARP funds were considered likely to be ceased by regulators.9 We also explore the
impact on distressed banks of receiving TARP funds. Panel C of Table 4 shows that these banks
do not behave materially differently with respect to the management of assets except that they
decrease fixed assets less than non-TARP banks. Surprisingly, TARP banks offer higher deposit
rates by 0.072%, but at the same time shrink their deposits even further, by an additional 3.0%.
These banks also raise more equity. We observe no difference in the evolution of dividend payouts
for these banks relative to other distressed banks.
We conduct several robustness tests for these results, presented in Internet Appendix Table
A3. In Panels A and B, we rerun the analysis for 1985-1994, but replace the main distress variable

9

Internet Appendix Table A3, Panel K, shows that once we exclude bank-months that were impacted by regulatory
action (PCA), distressed banks during the GFC issue equity as much as distressed banks outside the GFC.

22

to be the Low equity capital ratio and the Low Z-score, respectively. In Panels C and D, we repeat
these tests for the period of 2005-2014. In Panels E, F, and G, we rerun the analysis for 1985-1994,
but excluding the crisis indicator, for the three distress variables. In Panels H, I, and J, we presents
the analysis for 2005-2014, excluding the crisis indicator, for the three distress variables. Finally,
in Panel K, we examine whether the decrease in dividends in the second period is due to FDCIA.
We find that the decrease in dividends is similar when we exclude the banks constrained by
FDICIA. It should be noted, however, that in both periods regulators can order banks to stop paying
dividends if they so choose. Across all the robustness tests, the picture is similar to the one arising
from the main tests in Table 4: banks in distress shrink their assets, reduce their liabilities, and
increase their equity.
Overall, our results show that banks deleverage throughout their balance sheets. Contrary to
the widespread narrative from the S&L crisis that distressed banks increase their deposit rates in
order to attract deposits and invest them in risky assets, we find that deposits of distressed banks
shrink and that the interest rate they pay falls. As banks reduce their assets, their demand for
deposits falls and they offer lower rates. In addition, banks act to increase equity through cutting
dividends and raising new equity.

6. Bank Distress and Risk Taking
Despite the results that, on average, distressed banks deleverage, it is still possible that they
increase their asset risk which would be supportive of the gambling for resurrection hypothesis.
To investigate whether this is the case, we test whether indicators of risk taking change for

23

distressed banks. Since we include both private and public banks in our sample, we can only use
indicators that are available in call reports.
To investigate whether distressed banks increase risk taking, we consider how various
measures of bank asset risk evolve for distressed banks. We consider four measures. The first is
the logged Z-score which is a measure of distress risk. If banks take on riskier loans to gamble for
resurrection, we expect loan performance to worsen and the ratio of performing loans to total loans,
which we call the performing loans ratio, to fall. Similarly, we expect the volatility of earnings to
increase if banks take more risk. Lastly, for the 2005-2014 period, banks have capital requirements
that required them to weight assets differently depending on their risk. As a result, the change in
risk-weighted assets (RWAs) (scaled by lagged assets) is a measure of the change in the risk of
the assets. The lower this ratio, the safer the assets according to the regulatory risk-weights. In the
following regression, D denotes our distress indicator, Crisis is a crisis period indicator, and X4
denotes the controls:

Risk Measure (q, q+4) = f 4(D, D*Crisis, X4, Quarter FE, State FE)

(4)

In Table 5, we estimate our regressions with proxies for asset risk on the left-hand side. We
find that the Z-score increases for banks in distress, which means that these banks become less
risky. Columns (1) to (3) provide regression estimates for the first period. In Column (1), the
increase in the Z-score is 83.9 percent, which is almost a doubling of the Z-score. Admittedly, the
Z-score of the distressed banks is low, as the average of the 1st decile of the Z-score for the first
period is 7.35 (Table 1, Panel E). The ratio of performing loans to total loans increases substantially
as well. Finally, Column (3) shows that there is a drop in earnings volatility of 0.329 for distressed

24

banks. For all regressions, we have a Crisis interaction. The Crisis interaction is insignificant for
all three regressions. Columns (4) to (6) are the regressions in Columns (1) to (3), estimated for
the second period. The results for the coefficients on Financial distress are similar, except that the
coefficient for the regression for the Performing loans ratio is insignificant. However, the Crisis
interaction is significantly negative for the Z-score and for Earnings volatility. Column (7) uses as
dependent variable the Change in risk-weighted assets (scaled by lagged assets). If risk-weights
are good adjustments for risk, we would expect this ratio to fall when banks decrease their asset
risk. We see that the coefficient on Financial distress is negative and the interaction with the Crisis
is negative as well.
The results in Table 5 suggest that distressed banks increase their distance-to-default (Z-score)
and have lower earnings volatility in both sample periods (1985-1994) and (2005-2014). In the
latter period, distressed banks reduce their risk-weighted assets ratio, suggesting reduced holdings
of risky assets. The performing loans ratio increases for distressed banks for the first period but
not for the second one.
For the GFC, it is important to assess whether derisking is different for the banks that receive
TARP injections as there is evidence in the literature that these banks take on more risk (Black and
Hazelwood, 2013). We estimate the regressions in Columns (4) to (7) adding an interaction with
TARP, which is an indicator variable for the banks that receive TARP funding. The estimates in
Columns (8) to (11) show that the distressed banks that received TARP injections increase their
Z-score more than other distressed banks and reduce their earnings volatility more than other

25

banks. However, these banks experience a decrease in their performing loans ratio compared to
other banks.
We offer several robustness analyses. First, we present the results for the Low equity capital
ratio and Low Z-score distress indicators with Crisis indicator interactions (Internet Appendix
Table A4, Panels A and B), and for all three distress metrics without the interactions (Internet
Appendix Table A4, Panels C, D, and E). The results broadly remain consistent across
specifications. Then, to alleviate the concern that the results are driven by survival bias, we explore
one-quarter horizon instead of four-quarter horizon for the three distress variables, in Internet
Appendix Table A4, Panels F, G, and H. Again, the results broadly remain consistent. The only
variable that appears to materially weaken is the Performing loans ratio in the 1985-1994 period
(Panel H, Column (2)). In Internet Appendix Table A4, Panels I, J, and K, we also investigate how
the risk metrics change in the five to nine quarters after a bank is considered distressed (the twelve
months following the twelve months that we consider in most of our analyses). We see that banks
derisk for both periods for all measures except for the RWA/Assets(t-1) measure. However, in that
case, we find that banks that received TARP funds do not derisk. As earlier, we explore whether
our results are explained by PCA banks in the post-FDICIA period in Internet Appendix Table A4,
Panel L. We find that this is not the case. Our results hold if we drop all the banks constrained by
PCA.

7. Conclusion
The view that distressed banks either “gamble for resurrection,” or at the least, have strong
incentives to do so, has been held widely in both regulatory and academic circles since the onset
of the S&L crisis. Our analysis systematically examines whether distressed banks take on more

26

risk or whether they deleverage during two periods that include crises. The first period is 19851994 with the S&L crisis and the second period is 2005-2014 with the GFC. The periods are
separated by the implementation of important changes in regulation. In particular, prompt
corrective action was introduced with FDICIA and revised capital requirements based on the Basel
II Accord were implemented in the United States. Despite these dramatic changes in regulation
that were aimed at protecting the insurance fund from actions by distressed banks and improving
micro-prudential bank regulation more generally, we find more similarities than differences in how
banks respond to financial distress over the two periods. Our evidence shows that distressed banks
on average deleverage and derisk. During the GFC, there is some evidence that distressed banks
appear to deleverage less and derisk less, primarily because of lower equity issuance. Surprisingly
in light of the introduction of prompt corrective action, the fact that distressed banks deleverage
less and derisk less during a crisis is especially prominent during the most recent crisis.
Our results are inconsistent with the “gambling for resurrection” view. Our results apply on
average to distressed banks, so that it is certainly possible, even likely, that some banks did gamble
for resurrection during the periods we examined. However, our evidence shows that this view is
not helpful to understand the behavior of the average distressed bank. Many factors can drive banks
to deleverage and derisk and we show that these factors seem more important than incentives to
gamble for resurrection. Banks in distress find it harder to operate normally, so that gambling for
resurrection would make it even harder for banks to operate. Banks gambling for resurrection
might find it difficult to attract and keep customers and counterparties would be reluctant to deal
with them. Irrespective of the regulatory regime, they would be under pressure from regulators.
Managerial reputations would be endangered. As a result, commercial and market incentives as

27

well as incentives on the part of managers may make it optimal for the typical distressed bank to
deleverage rather than gamble for resurrection.

Table 2. Bank Distress Indicators and Future Failure
The table explores the ability of our indicators of bank financial distress to predict bank failure. Bank failure is defined
using the FDIC failed bank list. The data is a panel at the bank-quarter level. In Panel A, bank distress is proxied by
Low equity capital ratio, an indicator for whether the bank’s Equity capital ratio is in the bottom decile of the
distribution of the Equity capital ratio. In Panel B, bank distressed is proxied by Low Z-score, an indicator for whether
the bank’s Z-score is in the bottom decile of the distribution of the Z-score. In Panel C, Financial distress is an
indicator for whether the bank’s Equity capital ratio is in the bottom decile of the distribution of the Equity capital
ratio and Z-score is at the bottom decile of the distribution of Z-score. Standard errors are clustered by bank and
adjusted using the Driscoll-Kraay (1998) procedure for overlapping data. t-statistics are presented in parentheses.
Variable definitions are provided in Appendix A. *, **, *** denote statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1%
level, respectively.

Table 3. Do Distressed Banks Deleverage?
The table explores whether distressed banks deleverage. The dependent variable is the change in Equity capital ratio
over the four quarters following the distress quarter. The data is a panel at the bank-quarter level. Financial distress
denotes a bank that is both in the bottom decile of the distribution of the Equity capital ratio and in the bottom decile
of the Z-score distribution. Standard errors are clustered by bank and adjusted using the Driscoll-Kraay (1998)
procedure for overlapping data. t-statistics are presented in parentheses. Variable definitions are provided in Appendix
A. *, **, *** denote statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively.

Table 4. How Do Distressed Banks Deleverage?
The table explores how balance sheet items evolved for distressed banks in the four quarters following distress
quarters. The data is a panel at the bank-quarter level. Panel A presents regressions for the period of 1985-1994. Panel
B presents regressions for the period of 2005-2014. The dependent variables are different balance sheet items.
Financial distress denotes a bank that is both in the bottom decile of the distribution of the Equity capital ratio and in
the bottom decile of the Z-score distribution. Standard errors are clustered by bank and adjusted using the DriscollKraay (1998) procedure for overlapping data. t-statistics are presented in parentheses. Variable definitions are
provided in Appendix A. *, **, *** denote statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively.

Table 5. Risk Taking by Distressed Banks
The table explores how banks’ risk profiles change following distress quarters. The data is a panel at the bank-quarter
level. The dependent variables are measures of risk: logged Z-score, performing loans ratio, earnings volatility, and
risk-weighted-assets ratio. Financial distress denotes a bank that is both in the bottom decile of the distribution of the
Equity capital ratio and in the bottom decile of the Z-score distribution. Standard errors are clustered by bank and
adjusted using the Driscoll-Kraay (1998) procedure for overlapping data. t-statistics are presented in parentheses.
Variable definitions are provided in Appendix A. *, **, *** denote statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1%
level, respectively.

The chart presents the number of bank failures over time (all bars). The yellow bars (with dark frame) represent the
years we define as crisis years.

Figure 2. Distressed Banks over Time
The chart presents the fraction of distressed banks over time. Our indicators of financial distress are banks in the
bottom decile of the Equity capital ratio, in the bottom decile of the Z-score, and banks that are in the bottom decile
of both the Equity capital ratio and the Z-score (Financial distress indicator).

Internet Appendix Table A4. Additional Specifications of Table 5
The table presents additional variations to the main analysis presented in Table 5: exploring whether distress banks
increase their risk-taking activities. Standard errors are clustered by bank and adjusted using the Driscoll-Kraay (1998)
procedure for overlapping data. t-statistics are presented in parentheses. Variable definitions are provided in Appendix
A. *, **, *** denote statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively.
